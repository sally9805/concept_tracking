ENJOYING BUTTERFLIES // A Note from Kenn Kaufman // Most people seem to be aware of butter ? ies more as symbols than as real // living creatures . Although there are hundreds of species of butterflies in // North America , they somehow escape public notice most of the time . Out in // plain sight , they lead secret lives . // I still recall how surprised I was when I began to notice them // myself . At the age of fourteen , having learned a lot of my local birds , I // decided to see if there were any butterflies in the neighborhood . Amazingly , // as soon as I began looking for them , they appeared : Little Wood-Satyrs // flopping through the woods , tiny Reakirt " s Blues on weed flowers in vacant // lots , and dozens more . Although I had been outside looking for birds , up to // that time I had utterly missed these other winged creatures . // Butterflies are not birds , of course . They are very different in their // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they " re a lot smaller . // The biggest ones , like Monarchs and Giant Swallowtails , may grab our // attention , but most of the diversity is among the smaller butterflies . We // have far more species of little hairstreaks , blues , skippers , and the like than // we do of the big guys . Small can be beautiful : even the tiniest butterflies have // intricate patterns that are well worth appreciating . But until recently , it has // been extremely difficult to identify many of these butterflies in the field . // Even separating some larger species has been problematic , because their // identification often depends on small details . Until the recent development // of good close-focusing binoculars and cameras , many butterflies could be // recognized only by expert lepidopterists with vast experience . // I have been lucky enough to have one such lepidopterist as a // good friend for years , and luckier still that he is the kind of expert who is // always ready to share his knowledge . Jim Brock has studied butterflies // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzles everyone with his ability to // find and identify even the rare and little-known species ; but he will also // patiently point out the most common butterflies to anyone who wants to // know them . Jim agreed to coauthor this book as a way of helping new- // comers to the field . In doing so , he graciously accepted the challenge of our // Focus Guide format : boiling his vast knowledge down to just the essentials // that would be most useful in a pocket-sized book . If any serious // lepidopterists are displeased by the treatments here , they should blame me , // not Jim Brock . // But of course serious lepidopterists ( who already have their // technical reference works ) are not the primary audience for this book . The // Focus Guides are shortcuts , intended to be the best and fastest way to get // started in a subject , to send you outside quickly , putting names on what // you find . Slip this book into your pocket the next time you go exploring , and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // IDENTIFYING BUTTERFLIES // In naming a butterfly , the first step is to make sure that it really is one . The // order Lepidoptera includes the moths as well as the butterflies , and some // moths are active by day and are quite colorful . Usually they sit or behave in // an obviously different way from butterflies . If in doubt , look at the antennae . // On butterflies , the tip of each antenna has a thickened area , or " club . " North // American moths lack this feature ; their antennae are either threadlike to the // tip , feathery , or fringed along the edges . // Butterflies have four wings : two on each side , the forewing and the // hindwing . The upperside and underside of each wing usually has a different // pattern . To describe a color pattern on a butterfly , therefore , we have to say // where it is  --  for example , on the upperside of the forewing . Lepidopterists // can describe butterfly patterns in great detail using a system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It " s hard to apply that system // to an active butterfly in the wild , so we don " t use it in this guide , except to // point out the cell , an area outlined by veins near the base of each wing . // However , a few terms are necessary for communicating about the intricate // patterns of some species ; see the diagrams below for the simplified // terminology used in this guide . // What to look for : Wing patterns are obviously important in identifying // butterflies , but they are not the only clues . Here are some other points to // consider . // Size : Some swallowtails are six inches or more from one wingtip to the // other , while some blues are much less than an inch across . Since these // wingspan measurements are hard for most people to visualize , we have // treated sizes in this guide by showing one individual on each color plate at // actual life size in gray outline . The illustrations are in correct scale relative // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those on other pages ; be // sure to check the " actual size " figure each time you turn the page , to get an // idea whether the butterflies shown are actually big , medium-sized , or small . // Little butterflies do not grow up to be big ones : once they // complete the transformation to winged adult , their size does not change . // However , there are variations within a species . Early spring individuals are // often smaller than those of summer ; females are often larger than males . // And occasionally we see a " runt " individual that is oddly small . But with // experience , you will find that size is usually a good quick clue to // identification . // Shape : At a glance , most butterflies may seem to be roughly the same // shape . With closer study , you will begin to see differences in wing shapes // that help to create the distinctive look of each species . Some have // extended " tails " on the hindwings , or jagged or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subtle , such as the wingtips being // slightly more rounded or pointed . But with practice you will find that a // butterfly " s shape is an important identifying mark . // Posture : The way a butterfly sits is always worth noticing . Sulphurs almost // always perch with their wings folded tightly above their backs ; metalmarks // usually have their wings spread out flat ; cloudywings usually hold their // wings half open in a shallow V ; and grass skippers often hold their hindwings // spread farther than their forewings . Any butterfly may sit in an odd position // at times , but the typical posture can be a good clue to identification . We // have tried to illustrate and describe this for all species . // Flight style : Experts often can recognize a butterfly as it flits past  --  not // because they can actually see detailed field marks on its fast-moving // wings , but because the way it flies is a field mark in itself . Some species fly // erratically , others more directly ; some flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few times quickly and then glide . These flight styles // are hard to describe in words , but with practice you will learn to recognize // many of them . // Fine details : Some field marks involve very small details , such as the colors // of the eyes , the color or pattern on the antennae , or the color of the " face " // ( the palps , on the front of the head ) . These things really can be seen in the // field , but for wary species you may need to use binoculars . Good // binoculars are now available that can focus as close as just a few feet away , // allowing incredible views of butterflies and other small creatures . One good // source of information on binoculars for butterfly-watching can be found online // at www.eagleoptics.com. // Variation in butterflies : As with humans and other living things , no two // individual butterflies look exactly alike . Most of the variation within a // species is so minor that you won " t notice it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause confusion . Occasionally you " ll see an individual that looks // totally unlike the normal color pattern for its species ; these aberrant // butterflies may be identifiable only by shape or other clues . // Many species vary from place to place , and if these variations are // well marked , a local or regional population may be designated as a // subspecies ; see p. 14 for more information . There are also seasonal // variations . For example , Zebra Swallowtails flying in spring are smaller and // paler than those flying in summer , even though they all belong to the same // species ; Goatweed Leafwings flying in fall have more sharply pointed // forewings than those flying in early summer . Males and females often differ // in pattern or even in shape  --  sometimes subtly , sometimes so strikingly // that they appear to be unrelated . And finally , every individual butterfly // gradually changes in appearance as its condition becomes more worn and // faded . The two Painted Ladies shown here , for example , were sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the right can still be // identified , because Painted Ladies have lots of field marks , but some // butterflies in this condition would be unrecognizeable. // Habitat and season : Many butterflies are restricted to particular habitats , // and this is a key not only to finding them but to identifying them . We give // habitat descriptions for most species in this guide , and these should always // be considered . Seasons are important as well . Even in warm climates , only a // few species are on the wing year-round ; in most species , adults are present // only in certain seasons . We usually describe these flight seasons in // general terms , such as " early summer , " and these designations relate to // local conditions , not arbitrary calendar dates . The Sara Orangetip , for // example , is an early spring butterfly . It may appear by late January in // Arizona and not until the end of May in the Yukon Territory , but those dates // qualify as " early spring " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated for years whether field // guides should be illustrated with paintings or photographs . This book uses // a third method , introduced in 2000 with the first Kaufman Focus Guide , Birds // of North America : we begin with photos and edit them digitally to make them // all directly comparable , as paintings would be . // Some butterflies , such as sulphurs , never bask with their wings // open ; but it is still useful to know the colors of their uppersides , because // even at a glimpse in flight , a pale yellow one will look different from an // orange one with black borders . For most species like this , we provide // illustrations at reduced size showing their uppersides as an aid to // identification . Understanding the range maps : One of the most important // clues to identification involves knowing where you are . Most butterflies have // very specific ranges and are unlikely to be seen anywhere else . This is a // good thing , because some groups include similar species that are much // easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , Eastern and // Western Tailed-Blues look very much alike , but in most places you will find // only one or the other , not both . In identifying any butterfly , always check the // range maps to see which ones are likely in your region . // Most of the range maps in this guide have the distributions of the // butterflies indicated in green . This color means that the species is flying in // summer ( the peak butterfly season in most areas ) or in more than one // season ( for example , spring and summer , or even most of the year ) . We // use a darker shade of green for areas where the species is most common , // and a paler shade for areas where it is less likely to be seen . These // designations are quite arbitrary , but we hope they will be helpful in giving a // general idea of which species are most expected . // A few species fly mainly in spring or mainly in fall ; these are // mapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a darker shade for the // areas where they are more common . // Some butterflies , especially from southern regions , sometimes // stray far from their normal haunts . If there is a regular pattern of such // straying , we indicate it on the map with a dashed line beyond the typical // range . // FINDING BUTTERFLIES // Some butterflies are adaptable and may show up almost anywhere , but // most prefer a particular habitat . You will not see Salt Marsh Skippers in a // forest or Desert Elfins in a marsh . To see a wide variety of butterflies , // therefore , it " s necessary to visit many habitats . You should go at various // seasons , because many species have rather short flight periods : Falcate // Orangetips fly only in spring , Apache Skippers only in fall . This adds to the // enjoyment of butterfly watching , because you can hope to see different // species on repeat visits to the same place during the year . // Flowers : Not all butterflies fit the classic image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rarely or never seen at flowers . Still , to get // started , the easiest way to find butterflies is to find a good patch of blooms // in a garden or meadow , or by a roadside . Some flowers seem to be more // attractive than others , and some butterflies prefer certain types of flowers , // so it pays to look in a variety of places . // Mud : Males of some butterflies , including blues , swallowtails , and sulphurs , // are strongly attracted to damp soil . They are apparently taking in salts and // other chemicals from the mud . Sometimes these " puddle parties " involve // several species and hundreds of individuals , while at other times only a few // individuals will be present , but you should always check puddles and pond // edges for the presence of butterflies . // Other baits : Many butterflies are attracted to odd things such as flowing // sap , rotting fruit , or animal dung . ( This is especially true of some species that // tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Question // Mark. ) // Aside from these feeding behaviors , adult butterflies put most of their // energy into activities related to reproduction . Males spend a lot of time // looking for females ; females spend much time looking for the right places to // lay their eggs . Knowing their behaviors can help you find them . // Hilltopping : Male butterflies of some species look for mates by flying to the // top of a hill and patrolling or waiting there for the females to show up . If we // check the tops of low hills , especially from late morning to afternoon , we // may see butterflies that are hard to find in the surrounding country . // Patrolling : Males of other species fly back and forth along linear pathways , // such as trails or gullies , looking for females . They may come back time // after time to the same perches , allowing for repeated views . // Foodplants : Many butterflies are closely tied to the plants on which their // larvae feed . Hessel " s Hairstreaks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blues are usually seen sitting on buckwheats . A // skilled lepidopterist is often able to find particular butterflies by learning to // recognize their larval foodplants. // THE BUTTERFLY " S LIFE CYCLE // The amazing process of metamorphosis  --  the butterfly " s transition from // egg to caterpillar to pupa to winged adult  --  is well known and fairly well // understood , but it is still rightly regarded as a miracle . // The process begins with the egg laid by the adult female on or // near the plants that will serve as food for the caterpillars . Most butterfly // caterpillars can not survive on the wrong plants , so the adult " s choice of // where to lay her eggs is critically important . But given the right plant , the // caterpillar or larva ( plural : larvae ) is a little eating machine , and as it grows it // passes through about five stages , or instars , each one larger than the last . // Because the larva " s skin can stretch only so far , it sheds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instar . The last time it sheds its skin , it reveals not a // larger larva but the next phase in its life , the pupa ( plural : pupae ) . // The pupa , also called the chrysalis , is the stage in which the larva // is transformed into the adult butterfly . Unlike many moths , most butterflies // do not spin a protective cocoon ; their pupa is smooth but often colored for // camouflage . When the development inside is complete , the pupa splits // open and the adult crawls out ; after an hour or two for the wings to expand // and dry , the butterfly is ready for flight . // In cooler climates , butterflies have the challenge of surviving // through winter . Some pass the winter as eggs , others as partly grown // larvae or as pupae . A few overwinter as adults , emerging to fly about on // unusually warm winter days . But aside from such hibernators , and a few // large species such as Monarchs and longwings , most butterflies do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of weeks is a long life for a small // butterfly . // In some cases , a butterfly passes through all four stages in a // matter of weeks , and the whole cycle is repeated several times during the // year . In this guide we note how many generations , or broods , a species // may have per year . Many species have only one brood per year , and these // usually have short flight seasons . Some have fewer than one brood per year : // in the far north , where summers are short , some species take two years to // develop , hibernating through one winter as a small larva and the next winter // as a nearly full-grown larva ; adults may appear only every other year . // Some butterflies found in northern climates can not survive the // winter there in any stage . Instead , they invade northward every summer , // with some of their offspring surviving to move south in fall . These migrations // generally seem far more haphazard than those of birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // HOW BUTTERFLIES ARE CLASSIFIED AND NAMED // The sheer variety of nature is wonderful , but it can also be very confusing . // To make sense of this diversity , scientists classify living things in categories // such as order , family , subfamily , genus , and species . All butterflies ( and all // moths ) are classified in the order Lepidoptera . The color-coded sections in // this guide are built around families or subfamilies of butterflies . For most of // us , the most interesting category is the species  --  the basic " kind " of // butterfly that we write on our list of sightings. // Species of butterflies : Whole books have been written to define exactly // what a species is . No definition will fit perfectly , because there are many // borderline cases , populations that appear to be in the process of becoming // species but are not yet quite distinct enough . In general , members of a // species are isolated from members of other species in terms of reproduction . // Different species often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but they generally don " t . For example , Crossline and Tawny-edged // Skippers ( p. 324 ) look very similar to us , but they occur together over a wide // area without interbreeding , so they are clearly separate species . On the // other hand , the Red-spotted Purple and the White Admiral ( p. 210 ) look quite // different , but they seem to interbreed randomly where their ranges meet , // forming a broad blend zone in the northeast ; they are regarded as forming // just one species . Lorquin " s and Weidemeyer " s Admirals ( p. 212 ) also may // interbreed in the narrow zone where they meet , but much less frequently ; // they are still considered to be separate species . // Subspecies : Members of a species do not all look the same . Aside from // the kinds of individual variation mentioned on p. 9 , they may vary consistently // from one place to another . These regional variations , if they are well // marked , may be formally described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will interbreed wherever their ranges come in contact , so the // divisions between them are not precise . In some cases a species will vary // gradually over a wide area ( becoming gradually paler from east to west , for // example ) , and dividing this kind of clinal variation into subspecies is // arbitrary and not very useful . But if a subspecies has an isolated range and is // not in contact with other populations of its species , it may be very distinctive , // and may eventually become a full species . // In most cases we ignore subspecies in this guide , since the // differences are usually not obvious in the field . But if you develop a serious // interest in butterflies , you will discover a whole additional level of diversity // by delving into their subspecific variation . // Scientific names are applied to every known species . Mainly Latin or // Latinized Greek , these names are recognized by scientists working in any // language . The names are written in italics : Limenitis archippus is the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lorquin " s Admiral , // Limenitis lorquini , belongs to this same genus , so it is a close relative of // the Viceroy in spite of its different colors . If the scientific name consists of // three words , the third one is the subspecies . Limenitis archippus floridensis // is the dark subspecies of Viceroy living in Florida . // Standardized names : For some other groups of organisms , such as birds // and dragonflies , there are official publications ( produced by committees of // expert scientists ) that list all valid species and give standardized scientific // and English names for each . For butterflies , however , this has not been // done , and many different classifications and names have been used  --  you // might find the same butterfly called by three different names in three books . // To address this confusing situation , a committee of enthusiasts from the // North American Butterfly Association ( NABA ) has compiled The NABA // Checklist &amp; English Names of North American Butterflies ( second edition , // 2001 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and is not followed by all // lepidopterists , it has proven to be tremendously useful for amateur butterfly // watchers . In this book , for the sake of convenience , we have followed the // NABA list in almost all cases . // Most people who use English names for butterflies today use // names that identify them only to species , not to subspecies , except in a // few cases involving populations that are very notable for some reason ( such // as the San Bruno Elfin , an endangered subspecies of Moss " s Elfin ) . Unless // you plan to become deeply involved in taxonomic issues , it is usually easier // to stick with species names . However , some lepidopterists with a strong // interest in subspecies have suggested that each one should have its own // English name . We don " t follow this practice , but we should point out that a // list of suggested English names for all North American subspecies of // butterflies can be found online at http : **28;210;TOOLONG // The unknown : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // in a way that reflects our current understanding of how they should be // classified . However , no one should assume that this is the final word . // Scientific understanding of some groups is still developing . For example , // the little Spring Azure was long regarded as one variable species found all // over North America . There is now good evidence that it is actually a complex // of species , perhaps seven or more . Similar complexes may exist within what // we now call the Square-spotted Blue , Dotted Blue , Juniper Hairstreak , // Common Ringlet , Mormon Metalmark , Mustard White , and others . We still // have much to learn about them . // As an example of how much remains unknown , as this book was // going to press , we received word of a new species described to science . It // was not a drab , small butterfly from a remote wilderness , but a large , // spectacular one in the eastern United States ! This creature , the // Appalachian Tiger Swallowtail ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its similarity to the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail ; but it flies only in // spring , has no black form of the female , is larger than the spring brood of // Eastern Tiger , and has a narrower black and blue outer edge on the hindwing. // Opinions are still divided as to whether this is really a valid species , but it // looks promising , it hints at exciting discoveries remaining to be made . // OTHER ACTIVITIES INVOLVING BUTTERFLIES // Butterfly gardening : This is becoming tremendously popular in many parts // of North America , as people discover that they can add the beauty of // butterflies to their gardens . Whole books have been written on how to do it . // The details vary from one region to another , but the basics are the same // everywhere : plant some flowers for nectar to attract the adults , and plant // some foodplants for the larvae ( caterpillars ) . The latter aspect is sometimes // neglected , but it is very important . By planting to feed the larvae , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract a few adults // that happen to be passing through . // And whatever you do , don " t spray pesticides in your garden . // Butterflies are insects ; pesticides kill insects ( along with lots of other // things ) . A living garden with butterflies and bugs and other creatures may // have holes chewed in the leaves , but it will still be far more beautiful than // a " perfect " garden that has been sprayed and poisoned into sterility. // Butterfly photography : While bird photography usually requires bulky , // expensive telephoto lenses , butterflies can be approached closely and // photographed without much special equipment . A good macro lens is // needed for the smaller species , and flash is helpful . Our colleagues Rick // and Nora Bowers , who contributed more images to this book than any other // photographers , almost always use artificial light  --  a ring flash or a bracket // with two flash units  --  to get the best detail , color , and depth of field . But in // some situations it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Digital cameras have added a new dimension to butterfly // photography . They are improving rapidly , and the latest models do an // amazingly good job of capturing sharp closeups . We ( Bowers , Brock , and // Kaufman ) are all still using film and then making digital scans from the // slides , but we suspect that our conversion to straight digital photography is // not far off . // The field is wide open for aspiring butterfly photographers . While // Monarchs and a few others have been photographed many times , there are // very few images available for many of the skippers , hairstreaks , and others // ( as Nora Bowers discovered in trying to track down all the images for this // guide ) . If you seek out some of the less common butterflies , you may wind // up taking the world " s best photos of those species . // Visiting butterfly houses : In recent years , live butterfly exhibits have opened // in many parts of North America . While we generally prefer to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fascinating places to visit . They // usually feature large , showy species from tropical regions . Often // the " livestock " is supplied by firms in the developing countries of the tropics , // and these companies provide local people with a good income and an // incentive to preserve some pieces of natural habitat for butterfly populations . // Therefore , in addition to their educational value for visitors , these butterfly // houses are often supporting good social and conservation causes as well . // Conservation : The most important thing you can do with butterflies is to // help preserve their wonderful diversity . One of our main objectives in writing // this guide was to inspire more people to notice and appreciate butterflies so // that there would be more support for their conservation . // The main threat facing butterfly populations is loss of habitat . // Some of our most beautiful butterflies , such as the Regal Fritillary and the // Hermes Copper , have disappeared from much of their former range because // their specific habitats have been destroyed . Preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without them we will certainly lose some species . // Pollution of their surroundings , especially with insecticides , poses // another problem . Widespread , indiscriminate spraying for gypsy moths has // undoubtedly killed billions of butterflies , along with countless numbers of // our beautiful silk moths and others . Several butterflies in southern Florida // have become quite rare in recent years , and we have to wonder whether // heavy , continuous spraying for mosquitoes may have been a factor . // Uninformed persons sometimes imagine that butterfly collectors // pose a threat also , but there is scant evidence for this . During an average // week in summer there are probably more butterflies killed by cars on // American roads than the total taken by all the collectors in history . For any // would-be protectors of butterflies , harassment of net-wielding lepidopterists // is a waste of time ; habitat protection is a more worthwhile effort . // Two conservation groups especially deserve support . // The Xerces Society , 4828 Southeast Hawthorne Blvd. , Portland , // Oregon 97215 . Named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to // extinction by habitat loss in the 1940s , this organization works for the // conservation of butterflies and other invertebrates. // The Nature Conservancy , 1815 Lynn Street , Arlington , Virginia // 22209 . This pragmatic organization protects habitat in a very direct way , by // buying it . The Nature Conservancy has many good biologists on staff , // including some expert lepidopterists , and in working to save particular // habitats they take into account the needs of rare butterfly species . // Relations between watchers and collectors : We assume that most users of // this guide want to watch butterflies , not collect them . Collecting requires a // lot of equipment and a lot of work , and most people find it easier just to enjoy // live butterflies in the wild . However , these new watchers or " butterfliers " // should recall that essentially all of our knowledge of butterfly classification // and distribution is based on the work of collectors . They are the pioneers // and discoverers , and their work is not finished . // Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected // specimens are essential for study . Species of butterflies new to science are // still being discovered , and they must be scientifically documented before // their habitat can be protected , so collecting is an essential part of both // science and conservation . We have no evidence that collectors have ever // caused the extinction of a butterfly species  --  but a strident anticollecting // attitude might result in some species going extinct without having been // discovered . //
