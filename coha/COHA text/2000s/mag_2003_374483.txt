ABOUT HAUTE <P> Like a fox crossing a busy street , haute couture survives when by any measure it should n't . It 's excessive in a time of frugality . It 's celebratory when war looms . How can CEOs defend hand embroidery and expensive models to shareholders ? Quite easily , it seems . Days before its January show featuring models swamped in giant brocade kimonos , Christian Dior announced sales were up 50% . Not of kimonos but of shoes and bags and sunglasses , bought by those wowed by the couture . And then there 's Chanel , where the more wearable couture created by Karl Lagerfeld reportedly turns a profit . Women who pay more than $10,000 for a dress want to be able to wear it , after all . <P> moviemode <P> COSTUME DRAMAS There could n't be two more different movies than the spring releases Matrix Reloaded and Down with Love . Or could there ? Matrix achieves its cool look partly with its retro-futuristic clothes . Is Keanu Reeves ' Neo from the future or from some severe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic period ensembles look so very fresh . " The early ' 60s is the last time clothes were modern , " says Love 's costume designer , Daniel Orlandi . " Colorful , simple and architectural . " So what will the future look like ? Apparently , it depends on which past you like best . <P> flashcards <P> BRIDGE IS NOT HIP Nor is gin rummy . Canasta ? Disasta ! So why did a huge cast of big-name designers , including Diane von Furstenberg , Collette Dinnigan and David Rockwell , plus some celebrities agree to design a dowdy old playing card ? First , one of the hottest trends in design right now is crossing over  --  working in a discipline other than one 's specialty . Second , the money raised from the cards , which go on sale this month at MAC cosmetics stores , will benefit the MAC AIDS Fund . And third , the cards all feature naked people . The cards above , from left , were designed by makeup artist Billy B. , singer Vitamin C and artist Tyler Hayes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name that I have always regarded as sufficiently distinctive to view as mine alone . But a few weeks ago , I started getting calls from friends in publishing , telling me that the heroine of a forthcoming novel , The Devil Wears Prada ( Doubleday ) , is also named Andrea Sachs . Of course I had to read it . <P> It turns out that that Andrea Sachs wears Manolo Blahniks and Jimmy Choos , while I wear Nikes . That Andrea Sachs works as an assistant for the imperious editor of Runway magazine , while I work at TIME , covering the book beat . Still , people in the fashion world will probably be interested in the ( endless ) complaints of the fashionable Andrea , since the book 's author , Lauren Weisberger , used to be the assistant of Vogue 's uber-editor Anna Wintour . Could any real editor be as unreasonable as the novel 's Miranda Priestly , or as greedy for high-end booty from designers ? Ask the other Andrea .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
