In the Eerie silence of the empty foyer of Sterling Plaza , you can almost hear the grunts of the Hollywood tycoons who made and broke stars as casually as they lit and crushed out their cigars . MGM cofounder Louis B. Mayer built this Art Deco landmark in Beverly Hills 70 years ago , when the silents were turning to talkies. // The seven-story edifice , which boasts bronze-plated elevators , marble-lined corridors and formal parlors , could have been created by the set designer of Top Hat . // For more than a decade , the most opulent office space in 90210 has remained virtually unoccupied . The building 's sole tenant is its landlord , Donald Sterling , whose billion-dollar real estate empire occupies the sixth and seventh floors . " Some people think I 'm eccentric for keeping Sterling Plaza to myself , " Sterling says . " I like riding up and down the elevators alone . It 's a luxury I 've earned . " // With its sleek , gold-trimmed exterior and mostly vacant interior , Sterling Plaza neatly parallels another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During his 18 years as owner  --  the first three in San Diego and the last 15 in glimmering L.A.  --  the franchise has been little more than a punch line for Sunset Strip comics . Under Sterling the Paper Clips have had exactly one winning season and have lost more than twice as many games as they have won . In the 1997-98 and ' 98-99 seasons the perennial cellar dwellers won a combined 26 games , and this season , despite a snazzy new arena ( the Staples Center ) and a snazzy new rookie ( forward Lamar Odom ) , they have n't done much better ( 14-62 at week 's end ) . So hapless is Sterling 's team that after it beat the Toronto Raptors in an October exhibition game , Raptors forward Antonio Davis called a team meeting . " When you lose to the Clippers , " he explained later , " it 's time to stand up and say something . " // Sterling , a spectacularly successful real estate baron who owns the Malibu Yacht Club , the Beverly Comstock Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintively of his spectacularly unsuccessful team . " How do I handle losing year after year ? " he says . " How do I cope with the ridicule ? Let me ask you something : How would you cope with the ridicule ? " Sterling has a way of lobbing people 's questions back at them . He seems to do it not so much because he wants to elude hard questions but because he wants to know other people 's answers . // " How do I cope ? " he repeats . " It 's very hard . I 've suffered . Oh , how I 've suffered . Do you know what it is to truly suffer ? " // Do you ? // " Yes , I suppose I do , " says the 63-year-old Sterling . " The pain , the torment , the absolute torture ! How do the owners of the Chicago Cubs get through it ? How does anyone get through a difficult experience ? I 'll tell you how . You just keep going , keep fighting , keep living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // It 's fitting that Sterling set up shop in the House That Mayer Built . He seems benign and avuncular , but he has the furtive , feral charm of an old-time movie mogul . " I try to be warm and ingratiating with people and make them feel important , " he says . " I never met anyone I did n't like . I 'm very open , very honest , very caring . " // Of course , the moguls of yesteryear were neither open nor caring . They were difficult , and Sterling has a similar reputation . Few Sterling hirelings utter a word  --  much less a discouraging one  --  about their boss . Chris Ford , who coached the Clippers from 1998 until he was fired in February , declines to comment on Sterling . Jim Todd , the man who replaced Ford , says only , " Elgin Baylor and Mr. Sterling have always been very supportive of me . " Baylor , the Clippers ' general manager , who has known Sterling for 15 years , limits his remarks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even Bill Walton , the team 's outspoken TV color man , is mute on the subject of Sterling . About the only Sterling employee willing to go public is Lynn Lewis . " As an employer , he 's tremendously loyal , magnanimous and compassionate , " says Lewis , a Sterling assistant since 1994 . " He 's always ready to talk to you , to hear you out , to stand behind you . He treats everyone like family . " Lewis ought to know . She is Sterling 's kid sister . // For all his loyalty and magnanimity , Sterling is as eccentric as the next multimillionaire . ( When Sterling moved the Clippers to L.A. in 1984 , Alan Rothenberg , then the team president , said about his boss , " You 're going to call him the Howard Hughes of the NBA . " ) In the living room of his Greco-American-South mansion in Beverly Hills , Sterling once conducted a get-acquainted meeting with a top draft pick and his agent Bob Guccione  --  style , wearing nothing but a bathrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sometimes suggests entrees for others to order but does n't get anything for himself . " The idea , " says Michael Selsman , his former publicist , " is to make his guests share with him . " // When it comes to pinching pennies , Sterling is an embarrassment of riches . Old NBA hands still talk about how he reportedly tried to cut costs during his first season by asking coach Paul Silas if the players really needed a trainer and if Silas would mind taping them before games . Sterling is also said to have proposed to trim the team budget for his second season by slashing training-camp expenses from more than $50,000 to about $100 , scouting from more than $20,000 to about $1,000 , advertising from more than $200,000 to less than $9,000 and medical expenses from about $10,000 to $100 . ( Sterling says he does n't remember this , but Clippers executive vice president Andy Roeser , who was n't around at the time , says , " None of these cuts were ever proposed . " ) Sterling saved money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-month lockout was over . " Let 's put it this way , " says Ray Melchiorre , the team trainer from ' 96 to ' 99 . " Going without a coach did n't make the Clippers any worse . " // Sterling played his quintessential cheap trick in San Diego in 1981 , just after he bought the team . As a goodwill gesture , he invited prominent lawyers and real estate agents to have lunch , meet the players and enter a foul-shooting contest : Win and take home a $1,000 prize . Among the attendees was lawyer Michael Spilger , captain of San Diego State 's 1969-70 basketball team . Spilger made nine of 10 , only to be told the offer had been rescinded . The new prize was five days and four nights in Puerto Rico . " There was one catch , " says Spilger . " The deal did n't include airfare , transportation or food . I 'd have to pay my own way . " So Spilger told Sterling he 'd take the $1,000 . He remembers Sterling countering , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks , I 'll take the $1,000. " // Next , according to Spilger , Sterling asked if he 'd settle for two season tickets , and Spilger said , " I already have some . " So Sterling promised him that the team 's promotions department would work things out . Two weeks later , Spilger got a letter congratulating him for winning the top prize : Three days and two nights in Las Vegas . Unpaid but unbowed , Spilger sued the Clippers for fraud . At the home opener in ' 82 , a team official tracked him down and offered a compromise : a $1,000 donation to his favorite charity . " I 'll see you in court , " said Spilger . Two days later  --  and more than a year after he sank his free throws  --  he got his money . // The Clippers ' rebuilding program is in its third decade . They are lottery regulars , and Sterling has held at least two lottery parties at his Beverly Hills estate . The galas were the highlight of the Clippers ' season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads for " hostesses " interested in meeting " celebrities and sports stars . " Prospective hostesses have been interviewed in the owner 's office suite . One former Clippers coach recalls dropping in on Sterling during a cattle call . " The whole floor reeked of perfume , " he says . " There were about 50 women all dolled up and waiting outside Donald 's office , and another 50 waiting outside the building . The chosen few got to dress scantily , mingle with C-list actors and serve wine in plastic cups . " // Sterling has been the one constant through the years , so it 's easy to blame the team 's failure on him . " The truth is , " says Carl Scheer , the team 's general manager from 1984 to ' 86 , " there have been a lot of bad decisions by people who 've worked for him , including me. " // Those decisions have ranged from bad draft picks to bad trades to bad contract negotiations that radiated bad vibes . " Being a Clipper can be real tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughed it out with the Clippers from 1994 to ' 99 . " It 's almost a given that you wo n't win and that the team wo n't hold on to its best players . " Indeed , not one of Sterling 's nine lottery picks before 1998 re-signed with the team . Typically , the Clippers draft a promising player , nurture him and then watch him bail as soon as he 's a free agent , spreading their lottery legacy throughout the league . // " To have a decent team you need to keep a core of players together and let them grow , " says Los Angeles Lakers guard Ron Harper , a survivor of five Clippers campaigns . " Sterling does n't do that . He 's not a builder , he 's a meddler. " // Actually , Sterling does n't so much meddle as delay . He hedges . He vacillates . He agonizes . " Most NBA owners are distant and aloof and give only the pretense of being in control , " says player agent Arn Tellem , general counsel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so angst-ridden and vulnerable , you just want to hug him . He 's constantly seeking the advice of others . " // He hardly ever follows it , however . He tends to throw everything into committee , where there 's rarely a consensus . " Front-office meetings are like the Israeli Knesset , " Tellem reports . " There are usually more opinions than people in the room . " // To Scheer , " the most frustrating part of being G.M. was the lost opportunities . Sterling did n't trust his own basketball judgment and was n't prepared to accept mine . I 'd call him about a trade I wanted to pursue , and he 'd say , ' Let me get back to you . ' He 'd never get back to me . So nothing would happen . " // In the NBA success on the court demands a readiness to pounce and a willingness to spend . The Clippers payroll  --  $26.3 million  --  is the third-lowest in the league and roughly half that of the Lakers . " If you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll , so you 'll be able to sign free agents under the cap and get better , " says Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf . " Donald is in a great position if he spends wisely . " // So far Sterling has shown no interest in spending , period . " Cash is the root of all evil , and Sterling likes to hold on to his , " says Harper . " He wo n't hand it out to a player unless he thinks the player has earned it . Well , that 's not how things work in today 's NBA . Like it or not , an owner has to overcompensate his players . " // Harper was the Clippers ' second-highest scorer during the semi-glory years of 1990-91 and ' 92-93 , the only seasons besides 1996-97 that the team has made the playoffs . Even if all the star power the Clippers could muster at courtside was Billy Crystal , they seemed to be turning a corner . Then the other starters and coach Larry Brown left . " Suddenly it was just me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man standing on a ship that was going down . " // Harper signed for one year at $4 million in ' 93 , becoming one of the few big-ticket free agents in Clippers history to re-up . In a league rife with eight-figure salaries , $4 million  --  a sum that some teams dole out to a backup center  --  remains the most Sterling has paid a player . The Clippers tried to re-re-up Harper in ' 94 by offering him a five-year deal for $16 million . The Bulls offered him five years at $20 million . " Sterling 's people tried to convince me their offer was better , " Harper says . " I told them , ' It sounds $4 million worse . ' Finally they told me , ' O.K. , go ahead , have fun . ' And I told them , ' I will . ' " Harper laughs raucously and says , " I got three championship rings in Chicago , so I ca n't be mad . " // Many people believe that Sterling is playing a different game from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how important winning is to Donald , " says Scheer . " He seems more concerned mat his books are balanced , that he runs one of the few NBA franchises with no debt , that he can bring his friends to games . " Those friends  --  a mix of Friars Clubbers and Merv Era celebs  --  show up en masse at Sterling 's Malibu White Party , the extravagant tented barbecue-and-bubbly beach bash he often throws at his second home , a neo-Tudor oceanfront bungalow . The party is so named because guests are encouraged to dress all in white , as in The Great Gatsby . " Sterling 's agenda is as much social as professional , " says Los Angeles Times sportswriter Mark Heisler . " He loves the status that owning even a bad team confers . " // He also enjoys the publicity he 's received as a philanthropist . Southern California charities routinely fete Sterling as their Humanitarian of the Year . Since 1997 , the title has been accorded him by the Vista Del Mar Orphanage , the Special Olympics , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the L.A. Police Historical Society . Not that every charity has found it easy to separate Sterling from his swag . Linda McCoy-Murray recognized that last summer when she phoned him to help sponsor a golf tournament in honor of her late husband , venerated L.A. Times sports columnist Jim Murray . Every pro franchise in California , according to McCoy-Murray had forked over at least $5,000 to her foundation , which provides journalism scholarships . Every pro franchise , that is , except the Clippers , which had memorialized Murray on the final page of last season 's media guide . Sterling offered McCoy-Murray two season passes . " You know , that 's wonderful , " she remembers telling him . " but we 're trying to endow a college scholarship fund . We could really use cash . " // Sterling , she says , replied , " Those two tickets have a face value of $4,000 ! " // " Fine , " she said . " We can use the tickets for our silent auction . But would you also consider donating $5,000 ? " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following week . He never did Nor did he send over the season passes . " I decided against calling Donald back , " says McCoy-Murray . " I was n't going to go chasing after the almighty dollar . I feel bad for the Clippers organization . I think everybody in L.A. does . " // Selsman thinks that Sterling 's retentive streak is rooted in the poverty of his youth . " As a kid , Donald never had enough of anything , " says Selsman . " With him , acquiring great wealth is a crusade . He 's psychologically predisposed to hoarding . " // Born Donald Tokowitz , Sterling is the only son of an immigrant produce peddler . When Donald was two , he and his parents , Mickey and Susan , left Chicago for Boyle Heights , then a poor Jewish enclave in East L.A. Every day at 2 a.m. , Mickey would go to a farmer 's market to buy vegetables wholesale and truck them to restaurants . Young Donald worked as a grocery-store box boy , investing his meager wages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed . Unlike property , she reasoned , education can never be taken away . " You will go to college ! " she would tell her boy , pounding her fist on the dinner table . " You will be a professional . You will be a lawyer . " // The ever-dutiful Donald obeyed Mom 's will . In his senior year at Roosevelt High he was elected class president and went to the city finals as a gymnast . " My brother was very popular , " says Lynn Lewis . " He could win you over any way he wanted . " He went to the people 's colleges  --  Cal State L.A. and Southwestern University School of Law , graduating from the latter cum laude in 1961 , at age 23 . To help pay his way through , he moonlighted as a salesman at a furniture store . It was then that he changed his name to Sterling . " I asked him why , " a fellow salesman told Los Angeles magazine in 1999 . " He said , ' You have to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have confidence in . People want to know that you 're the best . ' " Sterling made Tokowitz his middle name and Shelly , the boss 's daughter , his wife . The couple , who are still married , would raise three children . // Sterling did not ascend unfettered in the legal profession . Back then big L.A. law firms rarely hired Jews , especially penniless ones with degrees from Southwestern . So Sterling hung out a shingle in Boyle Heights and became a tireless advocate for his old neighbors , handling everything from divorces to personal injury cases . Ten thousand cases by his count . He was so successful that within a couple of years he shifted his shingle to Beverly Hills . // At the precocious age of 27 , Sterling represented Selsman in a headline-grabbing divorce from actress Carol Lynley . " Donald took on the top legal talent at the Music Corporation of America , " says Selsman , " and would n't back down . " ( Selsman and Lynley wound up splitting their assets equally . ) Bigger clients and bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a handsome real estate portfolio . He made his bundle in two ways : gradually and then suddenly . Eschewing brokers , he stuck to a few affluent areas , invested when the market was soft , refinanced as the properties appreciated , and reinvested . He got tax breaks for reinvesting and reduced his capital gains taxes and transaction fees by never selling . His simple credo : Buy it , improve it , keep it forever . // Improving it  --  at least cosmetically  --  allowed Sterling to jack up the lease . In 1986 he hiked rents on his Beverly Hills properties so dramatically that outraged tenants marched on City Hall . " These days Sterling keeps up his buildings , but it 's almost impossible to get a security deposit back , " says tenant-rights activist Herm Shultz . " He was a very cunning and ruthless business-person , and he has n't changed his stripes any . We 're talking about the Humanitarian of the Year . " // As a tenant , Sterling is just as cunning . He does n't own the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 99-year lease with the Mayer estate that requires him to pay a relatively small annual fee and 15% of any rental income . But he wo n't rent to anyone . With no other tenant , the Mayer estate faces another 75 years with virtually no income from its Sterling Plaza property . By sitting and waiting , Sterling may force a fire sale . // Twenty years ago Sterling bought 11 Santa Monica apartment complexes from real estate magnate Jerry Buss , who used the money to buy the Lakers . Buss pitched pro basketball as the great investment of the ' 80s and encouraged Sterling to go after the Clippers , a full-court mess entropying in San Diego . The asking price was $13.5 million , but Sterling got the team on a layaway plan by assuming nearly $10 million in debts and deferred compensation . Sterling tried to remake the Clippers in his own image , plastering pictures of himself on billboards all over town . " It 's the start of a new era ! " he promised in an open letter to fans . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the city proud of the Clippers . I 'll build the Clippers through the draft , free agency , trades , spending whatever it takes to make a winner . " // Fans started wondering about Sterling 's new era at his first home opener , in 1981 . The Clippers won the game , but Sterling outperformed his players . He cheered wildly from his courtside seat , his shirt unbuttoned to the waist . As the game ended , he sprinted across the floor with his wine glass in hand and jumped into the arms of coach Silas . Then he high-fived his players , telling each , " I love you . " During that ' 81-82 season , as the Clippers went 17-65 , Sterling 's antics were more entertaining than those of his woebegone team . Silas returned from a goodwill trip to China in the summer of ' 82 to find his files stacked up in the hallway outside his office . Sitting at the coach 's desk was Sterling 's close friend Patricia Simmons . The former model had been appointed assistant general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties . // Sterling 's reign of error soon got costly . The league fined him $10,000 for publicly suggesting that the Clippers lose games to enhance their draft position . He did his part by refusing to add players when injuries reduced the roster to the league-minimum eight . The Clippers came close to forfeiting a game after forward Michael Brooks had oral surgery . Brooks had to suit up , and he actually played , though his jaw was as swollen as Sterling 's ego . // No draft choice could right the Clippers , and in 1984 Sterling moved them to L.A. But he failed to seek the NBA 's approval for the relocation , and the league fined him $25 million . Sterling sued the league for $100 million and withdrew the suit when the league agreed to reduce his fine to $6 million . // During their first season in L.A. the Clippers won only one more game than they had in their last season in San Diego , but they averaged almost 4,000 more fans at the Sports Arena , where the Lakers had played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the bottom of the league in home attendance . Things have n't improved ; the Clippers have had the league 's lowest attendance each of the last six seasons and rank 28th out of 29 teams this season . " The one thing you have to admire about Donald is that he 's loyal to Los Angeles , " says Tellem . " He 's passed up many opportunities to sell the team or move elsewhere for a lot more money . " In the mid- ' 90s Sterling turned down a $95 million offer to move 35 miles southeast to Anaheim , partly because he hates traffic . Not long after that an ownership group in Nashville reportedly made an overture worth almost $200 million , which Sterling also rebuffed . " I never sell anything , " he says . " I 'd prefer to stay in L.A. and lose money than move and make a fortune . " // Ticket prices seem to confirm this . An end zone loge seat at the Staples Center for a Clippers game goes for $40 ; the same seat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cost you $350 ; the identical seat in Jack Nicholson 's row will set you back $1,150 . " The Clippers are the people 's team , " says Steve Soboroff , who as senior adviser to Mayor Richard J. Riordan played a role in bringing them to the new arena . " Sterling has given fans who ca n't afford Lakers tickets a chance to see NBA basketball at a reasonable price . " // Other observers are n't so charitable . Sterling 's formula , according to one critic , is to inspire fans ' dreams without ever fulfilling them . " At some level Sterling must be content being the losingest NBA owner ever , " says David Falk , agent for Clippers power forward Maurice Taylor . " All the criticism he has gotten has n't changed the way he runs the team one degree . " // Whether because of Baylor 's poor judgment or Sterling 's meddling , or both , the team 's draft choices have been disastrous . In 1987 the Clippers selected Reggie Williams with the fourth pick . Think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pippen or Reggie Miller instead ? Or how about 1989 , when the Clippers had the second draw and chose Danny Ferry , passing on Glen Rice ? Ferry bailed immediately for Italy , and Rice became an All-Star Game MVP . One more : In 1990 the Clippers looked past Jayson Williams , Dee Brown , Tyrone Hill and Toni Kukoc and got Bo Kimble out of nearby Loyola Marymount. // Last year , when the draft did n't have enough marquee players to excite Sterling into ignorant interference , Baylor snagged the 19-year-old Odom with the fourth selection . It was the kind of thought-out risk that makes teams winners . " Donald Sterling had absolutely nothing to do with getting Odom , " Baylor says testily . " That pick was mine and mine alone . " // Baylor has reason to be testy . Sterling has a history of Clipping his wings , most famously in 1993 when Baylor tried to make a trade with Miami . Danny Manning , then the Clippers ' star forward , had a year left on his contract and was angling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat : Manning for Rice and Willie Burton . Sterling , certain he could sway Manning to stay , showed up at training camp and pleaded with him . Manning listened politely . " He 's softening ! " Sterling told team officials and called off the trade . Four months later , with Manning no softer , Sterling relented . The 27-year-old was swapped to Atlanta for free-agent-to-be Dominique Wilkins , who was 34 . Wilkins carried the Clippers over the last half of another dismal season , then rejected Sterling 's new contract offer , which was half of what Dominique had demanded . Wilkins left , and the team was left with nothing . // From a penthouse window in Sterling Plaza , the five-time Humanitarian of the Year gazes out at Los Angeles with mournful , drooping eyes that seem to have witnessed all human sadness . " Basketball is the only aspect of my life in which I have n't been a winner , " he says . " I want to win badly , I really do . It has n't happened yet , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You tell him you have no idea . " Yes , well , I think it will , " he says . " It must . It simply must . " // He settles into a chair behind a cluttered Louis XIV desk on which a bronze placard sits : MAY WE ALWAYS LAUGH , DANCE AND SING OUR WAY THROUGH LIFE . He meets your stare , his eyes less menacing than searching , and tells you he 'd rather discuss the bright Clippers future than the blighted Clippers past . You mention Taylor  --  whose contract Sterling has refused to extend for six years at $71 million , the maximum allowable  --  and ask if Sterling thinks the player will follow through on a recent promise to bolt . " Taylor will only bolt if we want him to bolt , " Sterling says without much conviction . " No player ever left the Clippers that we did n't want to . " Still , you say , the Clippers again stand to get nothing for something . " I only pay superstar prices for superstar players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't think Taylor is a superstar , do you ? He 's not a superstar . " // What about Odom ? // " He 's going to be a superstar , " Sterling says , " and when he becomes one , I wo n't let him get away . " // What if you realize too late that he has become one ? // Sterling 's shoulders shift . An awkward silence follows . You bring up Buss , who has won five NBA tides by paying superstar prices for everyday players . Sterling says he admires Buss but does n't measure his team against the Lakers . " Let 's say you take your child to see Shirley Temple onstage , " he says . " And let 's say you tell yourself , Would n't it be nice if that was my child up there ? And you think , My child will never be Shirley Temple , but I love her all the same . So you send her for dancing and singing lessons and hope that one day she 'll have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never be Shirley Temple . " He leans back in his chair trying to relax , looking slightly pained . " I 'm only as good as my advisers , " he says . // So why not hire new ones ? " Part of the reason is loyalty to my G.M. , " he says . " I like Elgin , I respect him and trust him . I want to give him a chance . I want to see him succeed . Some people think the solution to everything is change . I like continuity . " He gives a dry smile . " Have we made the right decisions in drafting ? Presumably not . Have we made a lot of mistakes ? Yes , we 've made a lot . Have we learned from our mistakes ? I hope so . At times , I feel as if I were a scientist making progress toward the cure of a disease , yet the lab mice keep dying of cancer . " // Earlier that day , in the lobby of a Beverly Hills hotel , Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to solve the riddle of the NBA 's greatest tale of futility . " After all these years as an owner , Donald still does n't know how to run a team , " Dean said . " His problem is he does n't know that he does n't know , and wo n't hire someone who does know . You know when the Clippers will be successful ? When Donald finds out what he does n't know . "
