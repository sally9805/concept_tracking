Athletic events , as this year 's Olympics reminded us , are meant to be one of the purest forms of competition , but frequently the drama surrounding the events displaces the athletics themselves . Sheila Finch 's new story takes us into the near future with a vision of how technology might affect one champion competitor . Ms. Finch herself has shown her mettle recently by refusing to let persistent ankle problems deter her from finishing the novel expansion of her Nebula  --  winning story " Reading the Bones . " The book is due out soon from Tachyon Publications . <p> WHEELING UP TO THE START in the wintry dawn , he feels a dizzying rush of nervous excitement and spiking fear . He wills his bunching muscles to relax , hands - palms already hot in leather gloves - to unclench . He breathes deeply of cold , Pacific air , drawing in energy . He is the silent center of jittery activity . Wheelers lean toward each other , slapping warmth into cold arms . Women talk in brief spurts together , voices brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , a shimmering kaleidoscope against the city skyline . He recognizes many of them . Race gypsies , veterans from all the marathons across the nation and across the globe . He stretches his head from side to side , working on tension in his neck . A TV camera pans over to his lightweight , three-wheeled racing chair . Adrenaline floods . He raises two fingers in a victory sign . The silver eye pauses , sweeps on . Murmur of voices drops away . Two minutes and three seconds to go . The day was warm for early January , and the city seemed to have sprouted a more elegant skyline in the year Jeff Brandeis had been in Europe . He eased his van into a handicapped slot outside the office of the Long Beach Marathon and took a deep breath , dispelling the empty sensation in his stomach that had been there since he landed at LAX two days ago . " Well , hello , Champ ! " a woman cooed . " Good to see you ! " Jeff waved . Strangers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Been away too long .. Problem was , after breaking records in a string of races from Oxford to Cannes , he 'd been too popular with a couple of French actresses . One , with long blonde hair , had been eager to show him around Paris after dark . Life was good to champions . A far cry from the early days when his mother fixed him up with a friend 's daughter , a do-gooder who got off on the inconvenience of dating a guy in a chair . Her idea of a swell time was to stir the sugar in his coffee as if he 'd lost the use of his hands instead of his legs . He shut the car door and swiveled the chair . Inside the office , he saw they 'd hung a large collection of marathon photographs on the white wall , several of them him crossing the FINISH in previous years . He was in even better form now . Some new training tactics he 'd figured out with a couple of European racers , a new aerodynamic wrinkle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the wheeled variety , was a young man 's game , and the years were beginning to pile on . The next couple were crucial . He had plans to hammer his own record so hard it 'd take anybody else a decade to catch up . Something his mother could think about without tears . Meg Lowenthal glanced up as the door banged behind him . He admired her expensive-looking yellow linen suit , the deep neckline revealing cleavage , the way her pertly cut coppery hair bounced as she moved . He 'd always been more attracted by a woman 's hair than by her face , the thicker and longer the better . He wheeled up to her desk . " Hey , gorgeous . " " Jeff ! I did n't know you were in town . Give me a minute here .... " She turned back to the computer . " Take your time . I 'm enjoying the view . " " Sexist pig , " she said . He grinned . She 'd liked it enough to hop into bed with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Came right over to register . " " Oh ? We thought you might not want to race . " He gripped the chair 's arm-rests . " Who told you that ? " " Well - you were out of the country , but we thought .... 11 She looked as if she were about to say something else , then changed her mind . Jeff banged a fist on her desk , rattling pencils . " Look . I want to register . You going to tell me I ca n't ? " The door at the back of the office opened and a middle-aged man in a gray Armani suit stood frowning . Phil Zukowski made his money from a car dealership in Signal Hill , but organizing the marathon was his passion . When he saw who it was , Zukowski came quickly forward , hand outstretched . " Brandeis . A pleasure to see you , Champ . " " What 's this about , Zukowski ? " " That orthopedics guy at UCLA that 's been in the news , " Zukowski said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find you , so we thought - " " I was in France . " He 'd heard about the Schwann cell research on CNN . The blonde actress had pretended to get all excited for him . The hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach came back . " That 's right . You did **26;634;TOOLONG in Cannes , did n't you ? World record . " Zukowski picked up a mug by the slick gray Mister Coffee pot . " Want some coffee , Champ ? " Jeff shook his head . " You know this guy personally , do n't you ? " " Tommy Dorseter . He was my surgeon . Played baseball at Cal State - before my time . He was good , could ! ve played professionally . Went to med school instead . " While Jeff had gone on to a series of dead-end jobs and a serious accident , but he did n't say that . " What 's it got to do with me racing ? I 'm ready to roll . " Zukowski gave him a thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jeff . You 're a superior athlete . The champ . " " Right . Give me the entry form . " " We just thought - Doctor Dorseter must want - " Zukowski squirmed under Jeff 's gaze . Meg opened a drawer and handed him an entry form . He jerked the chair around , headed for the narrow doorway , and found it blocked by a tiny woman in a wheelchair that seemed two sizes too big . Carrie Stevens had short , baby-fine , light brown hair . Delicate featured , she wore a pink warm-up suit embroidered with small flowers . He 'd known Carrie for several years ; her fragile appearance disguised a determined racer though she 'd never taken the sport as seriously as he had . Carries glance flicked from Jeff to Zukowski and back again , taking it in . " You look like you need a break . Want to go for coffee ? " He 'd taken her out for coffee or a movie a couple of times , before his fame had brought lookers like Meg Lowenthal around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " " There 's a new place opened on the pier since you 've been gone , " she said . " Let 's catch up . " Half an hour later , they sat outside the coffee bar on the pier beside an overgrown fern that seemed about to make a break from ceramic captivity ; The breeze off the water was sharp and clean like crystal . He stirred Sweet " n " Low into his coffee mug as Carrie talked , barely listening to her stories about other racers , thinking about Dorseter . Tommy 's interest in orthopedics had been spinal cord injuries long before Jeff 's accident . Prostheses were good and getting better all the time - Jeff knew a couple of amputees who raced - but the does could n't seem to fix severed cords . Schwann cell transplants , CNN had reported , looked like they might change that . " That doctor from UCLA was asking about you , couple of weeks ago , " Carrie said . " Does the whole goddamn city know my business ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office when he called , Jeff . I 'm not racing much anymore , but I drop by once in a while to keep in touch . That 's all . I 'm not trying to intrude . " " Got nothing to do with me ! " " Well , I thought - " She broke off and stared out at the ocean , her cheeks showing a faint pink . A gull landed on the rail beside his chair , stared insolently at him for a second . He flicked a finger and it flapped away . It was n't Carries fault , but he did n't want to think about Dorseter or his work . " Snake oil , " he said . " Cold fusion . Perpetual motion . " " I do n't think so . " She turned back to him , her face a mask he could n't read . " There were a couple of articles on Dorseter in the LA Times . You ought to take a look . " " Not interested . " " Have n't you ever thought what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your legs ? " " No . " He could tell from her expression she did n't believe him . They 'd always been upfront with each other , but this was n't something he wanted to talk about , not even with her . The breeze off the ocean had turned cold . He pulled up the collar of the black Italian leather jacket the French actress had given him , remembering a phone call soon after he 'd won his first marathon . " Animal results show great promise , Jeff , " Tommy Dorseter had said . " Someday you 'll be able to throwaway your chair ! " " What if do n't want to ? " he 'd said . " Do n't want to ? " Dorseter repeated . " Why the hell would you want to be handicapped if you did n't have to ? " It was ironic , the way he looked at it . The chair had freed him from the handicaps of his youth - no talent and mediocre looks - replacing his early lack of success with fame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormous high he got from racing . " What 's so difficult about the concept ? " Carrie asked . " People get artificial hearts when they need them . And kidney transplants are commonplace . Why not a fix for legs that do n't work ? " " The word is " need . " I do n't . " He pulled money out of his wallet , snagged a passing waitress , and got into a thing about the bill . Easier than answering her question . The race officials start the wheelers five minutes before the runners as usual . He does not need the other competitors , never has . He aims only to beat his own best time in each race . The minute he starts rolling , something begins to grow that he calls the Race Mind , blotting out all thought except what he needs to move swiftly and smoothly down the course , knitting together man and chair . For the first few miles , his concentration is on action , the powerful muscles working in his arms , strong fingers rhythmically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a synthesis of efficient motion . He is aware of a background world where sun sparks water below the bridge as he heads over it , the cool breeze slides past his brow , gulls pace him then fall away , spectators along Shoreline Drive wave him on . A cop on a motorcycle salutes . THE ANSWERING machine blinked notice of messages from Mai and jen that had come in while he was out . Aspiring models , his personal groupies welcoming him home . He knew the real reason behind his appeal for them . He was a photo-op , good for publicity . But it was a two-way street . His bed never needed an electric blanket , and there were no strings attached to the transaction . The third message still waiting was from Tommy Dorseter . What he needed right now was a shot of reality , not some medical fantasy . He grabbed the phone and punched in Salvador Mendez 's number . Sunlight reflecting off the bay streamed through open French windows leading onto his balcony . Race money , a Pepsi endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for this condo unit . Without racing , he 'd have been stuck working another dead-end job , maybe selling cars at Zukowski 's dealership in Signal Hill , living in a bachelor apartment with furniture from the Salvation Army thrift shop . Or at home with his mother where the furniture was better but the pity worse . " Sal ? Hey , amigo ! How much am I gon na beat you by this year ? " The Barrio Bear was one of the few who could make a race interesting for him . " Not racin " this year , " mano . " Mendez said . " Outta practice . " " You got ta be kidding , right ? " He gazed out the French windows at a group of kids in sabots , tacking inexpertly across Alamitos Bay , sails luffing . The streaks of white sunblock on their faces gave them the look of small-fry Apaches . He 'd taken sailing lessons on this bay when he was a boy . He 'd been hooked early on the thrill of competing even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for a livin ' . Got me a job out at Rancho . " Mendez laughed . " Nurse 's aide . Gon na be an inspiration to all them new crips ! " Rancho Los Amigos , the county 's orthopedic rehab facility where they 'd first met . He could n't imagine spending time there by choice . " Hard to believe , amigo . " " Gettin " married , too . No time for playin " round no more . " " Congratulations . " He regretted making the call . Sal was a couple of years older than he , same type of injury , but Sal 's accident had been gang related . His had been less dramatic ; he 'd smacked a motorcycle into a utility pole on a day when he could n't blame the weather . Another example of his general failure at everything in those days . The shared frustrations of rehab had brought them together ; racing and women had kept the friendship going . They 'd been two of a kind , consumers of all the thrills they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibilities . He 'd never considered Sal might get married . ... bridges the tucked up nerves again , Doc says , " Mendez was saying as Jeff shook his attention loose from the past . " What ? " " Doc Dorseter . He comes maybe coupla times a week , checks out his students . " " So ? " " Don " you watch TV , ' mano ? Schwann cells/he calls " em . Gon na fix us up , one a these days . It " That what you want , Sal ? You get your legs back , you 'll never race again . You willing to give that up ? " " Just a race , " mano . " Mendez sounded puzzled . " Just a fuckin " race . Chair ai n't no badge of sainthood . " There 'd be no competition this year . So what ? He did n't need anybody else . He hung up the phone and went out . He put in two hours " practice on the track at Cal State before sunset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day when the phone rang . He almost did n't answer it , thinking it was his mother again . She 'd already called once today . Did n't he think Tommy Dorseter 's work could be The Light At The End Of The Tunnel For His Problem ? He could almost hear the capitals in her words . This time it was Meg Lowenthal . He made a date for dinner , then found clean sheets for the bed just in case he got lucky . He settles into his pace with an upwelling sense of robust health and fierce strength , the aching happiness that comes to him from racing . After a race , he feels cleansed of all the strangling difficulties of his life . All the hard decisions fall into place . The chair sets his spirit free . The course climbs a small hill , then flattens again . Plum trees line the next block , white petals drift like confetti . Music blares at an intersection , a local combo playing enthusiastically . Women in bright tracksuits cheer . A dog barks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course . The scent of fresh-cut lemon teases his nose . He feels as if he could race like this forever . AFTER THREE MORE pleading messages from his mother over the next week- followed by a fax of the LA Times articles about Dorseter 's work , marked up carefully so he would n't miss the important parts - Jeff gave in and called Dorseter at UCLA . Could n't hurt to see what was on his mind . Maybe they 'd swap tall stories about glory days on Cal State 's diamond . " Come on out to Rancho and we 'll talk , " Dorseter said , sounding rushed . " I 'm there Thursdays , supervising interns . Got a proposition for you . " " You got Sal already . I 'm not looking for work . " But he could guess what Dorseter wanted to propose , and it was n't emptying bedpans . Dorseter laughed . " Come anyway , Champ . " Waste of time , he told himself . He went out and spent several hours circling the university track until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rancho 's parking lot was wet as he drove up on Thursday . He slid out of the driver 's seat into his folding chair . The van in the next slot had the back door open , and beside it a woman was opening an umbrella over a small girl in a chair . The child grinned when she saw him and held up a hand . " She has photos of you on her wall , Mr. Brandeis , " the mother said . " You 're her hero . " He high-lived the girl 's tiny hand . " Gon na win the next one for you , sweetheart . " " Promise ? " " I promise . " The child giggled . In a good mood now , he wheeled away as raindrops spattered his leather jacket . He figured he 'd listen to Dorseter to satisfy his mother , put an end to the tearful messages . But he was n't interested . What was the big deal about walking , anyway ? He 'd been quoted in the papers once saying , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped people with wheels instead of legs . Caused quite a reaction in some quarters with that remark . His mother had n't liked the joke either ; she took this disabled stuff too seriously . Then he thought of the child and his mood darkened again . Dorseter 's office was at the end of a white corridor lined with children 's art , but Dorseter himself was n't in it . A nurse indicated Jeff would find the surgeon down the hall in physical therapy , a room he and Sal had referred to in the old days as the " TC , " the Torture Chamber . A buzz of noise came from the TC as the door sighed open at his approach . He remembered this place well . A cross between a high school gymnasium and a NASA training facility for astronauts , it contained some of the most fiendishly designed equipment ever to coax damaged body parts to work again . Half a dozen men and women practiced new strategies for old tasks , some moving scarred arms against the resistance of weights and pulleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or walking up and down ramps getting used to new prostheses . A young guy sitting on a bench at the far end of the room caught his attention . Two male physical therapy aides in white coats lifted him to his feet and propped him upright . Judging by the way the guy 's face scrunched , he was n't enjoying it . Dorseter was halfway down the TC , talking to a female intern . He glanced up and motioned for Jeff to come over . " Well , what d' you think ? " Jeff played it cool . " Same old TC . " " You said you 'd read about my work . " " Saw the articles . Not necessarily read . Not my game . " Dorseter studied him thoughtfully . " That sounds defensive , Champ . Look . I 'll give it to you straight . Animal results are so good , we 're ready to use this treatment on humans . " " Cruel and unusual experiments on humans went out of fashion with the Nazis , Doc . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? " " No . Should I ? " Dorseter turned serious . " Yes , I think you should . This is revolutionary . We grow the Schwann cells in the lab , then transplant them into the spinal cord . They coax nerve fibers to regenerate . We 've never found anything like this , Jeff . Severed nerves re-grow . Establish their own blood supply . Even develop protective myelin sheaths . " " In a petri dish . " " In lab animals . " " Do n't look at me . I 'm not a guinea pig . " Somebody shrieked nearby . Jeff turned to stare . The guy he 'd noticed was now doubled over , vomiting - a sour stench . Not uncommon in the TC . An orderly arrived to clean up . He had a wrenching memory of the first day they got him out of bed at the hospital after the accident , the nausea that tore through his gut as they hoisted him painfully upright , the despair that flooded through him when he glanced down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsiness of that first chair , the energy it took to perform the simplest tasks , the frustration of learning to accept limits . The aching sense of loss . It had taken him a long time to put all that behind him . Dorseter said , " I could show you the dogs - " " Bizarre , man ! Why me ? Got to be a lot of other guys salivating for the chance . I 've got my life together without it . " " Have you , Jeff ? How long 's it going to last ? " Across the echoing room , Jeff saw the young man resting alone on a bench , towel pressed to his forehead , looking washed out as if he 'd just finished a race . A deep yearning swept through him , but he was n't sure for what . The renown of being a star athlete ? The thought of walking again ? His hands clutched the armrests of his chair till he could feel the pulse hammering at his wrists . He let go , expelling tension in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got work to do . " He swiveled the chair to face the exit . Dorseter put a hand on his shoulder . " Something else . Something you should seriously consider . " " Give it up , Tommy . " " There may not be a " later " for you . You need this chance now . How long 's it been since your accident ? Four years ? Five ? " " You 're thinking foot drop , muscle atrophy - " " No . " Jeff shook his head . " You do n't understand . I do n't have the time . I need another couple of years racing before I even consider something like this . " " You do n't have another couple of years ! " Dorseter said . " Wait much longer and we wo n't be able to reverse the changes in the vertebrae that 're taking place , no matter whether the nerves regenerate or not . " He stared at the surgeon 's grim expression . Face the truth , he told himself . This was why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress . Ever since he 'd heard the CNN report , he 'd been afraid of getting hit with an impossible choice . " Think about it . " Dorseter squeezed Jeff 's shoulder . " You could be just the way you were before the accident . " " Right , " he said , his eyes stinging . " A straight-C bozo the chicks avoided . A zero on the field . A world-class nothing . Great , man . Fucking great ! " He wheeled urgently out of the Torture Chamber . Breath burns in his throat now . His lungs labor . His chest seems encased in crushing iron . Fingers cramp . Pain knifes his shoulder muscles . Blood roars in his ears . In spite of the headband he wears , sweat pours off his brow and stings his eyes , blinding him . The day grows hotter . The breeze fails him . Despair claws at his heart . He 's a fool to put himself through such agony . He does n't have to prove anything to anybody . In the sweaty fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - gaunt palm trees - volunteers sprinkling water from garden hoses pelicans gliding overhead like stone age icons - police cars blocking traffic . Everything passes in a slow-motion , nightmarish blur of silence and pain . So many more agonizing miles to go . He has hit the Wall . Carrie refused his invitation to go out for dinner . He did n't tell her he 'd called Meg Lowenthal first but she 'd turned him down . Mai was on location ; Jen had n't called back . He had n't seen Carrie since the day he 'd registered , but he needed to do something to clear his mind . She offered to cook at her place instead . He told her he 'd be there at five . It 'd been a mistake to go out to Rancho , a distraction from the serious training he needed to do . For days after his conversation with Dorseter , he 'd tried pouring all his energy into preparing himself for the race , wheeling along the race route for several hours in the gray light of early morning until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't rid himself of Dorseter 's words . The phone rang while he was dressing ; he let the machine answer . His mother again . Another guilt rap for him to come to his senses , not to be scared , to take advantage of his golden opportunity . To her , his choice seemed clear . But only a fool would trade the future he had in sight for the uncertainties of pain and obscurity that would come with Dorseter 's surgery . If it even worked . How could he make a decision like that ? He went down to the condo 's garage and found the van . Carrie lived alone in an old house she rented , a small guest house behind the larger one on the bluff . All she could afford on her salary , probably . She was a teacher , maybe a librarian , he could n't remember . Something unspectacular but socially useful . He wheeled up the ramp and rang the doorbell . Across busy Ocean Boulevard , the water churned with white caps . A lone sailboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming home before darkness fell . He watched for a moment , admiring the unknown sailor 's pluck challenging the weather . Taking risks . Going all out for life no matter what . Inside , the house was warm and unpretentious , what he would 've expected of Carrie . He felt comfortable , as if he 'd just taken off a heavy winter overcoat . She turned on a lamp ; light and shadow quilted the living room . Mozart played softly in the background . A water jug waited on a small oak dining table . Carrie poured him a glass , then went into the kitchen , explaining the casserole needed a few more minutes . " I heard you went out to Rancho , " she called . Dishes rattled and he caught the rich smells of onions , tomatoes , and baking bread . " Must everybody get on my case ? " " Sorry . Sal was just excited for you . " Mozart wrapped it up . In the silence he heard the slow tick of an antique clock somewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard . Miniature orange and lemon trees made splashes of color along a battered redwood fence . A large tortoiseshell cat slumbered next to a pot of scarlet geraniums . Tomato plants heavy with winter fruit , pots of chrysanthemums and cactus crowded on benches and shelves for easy reach from her wheelchair . She came back into the room and refilled his water glass . " That 's Gertie , " she said , nodding at the cat . " Never understood what people see in cats . " " She 's my best friend . " " Kind of lonely with only a cat in your cheering section , is n't it ? " She gazed at him , something in the blue eyes he 'd never seen before , maybe anger at his remark . " I do n't know , Champ . Is it ? " He stared out the window , avoiding her gaze . But he could n't avoid this . And maybe she was the only one he could talk to , the only person with no stake in what he did or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrie ? " " I 've used a chair since I was fourteen . I 'm not a good candidate like you . " " But if you could ? " " I read about a blind man once , " she said . " They restored his sight somehow . But then he took to wearing dark glasses indoors . " " You figure I 'm scared ? " " Not of the surgery , no . " " I do n't think I could live without racing . " She said lightly , " If you 're not the champ , you 're nobody ? " He regretted the cheering section remark . But she was right . No point in arguing ; she saw clear through his pretenses . " Maybe it wo n't work on humans . " She folded napkins and set them in place before answering . " There are never any real guarantees in life , Jeff . Things happen . " " Why would I want to take the risk ? I 've got it good now . " " I remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments . " The woods are lovely , dark and deep . But I have promises to keep . " " Robert Frost . " He was mildly surprised to dredge up even one name from his mediocre undergraduate performance . " And miles to go before I sleep . " " The promises were to myself , " she said . A bittersweet memory from childhood flooded over him : A picnic in El Dorado Park by a lake speckled with ducks - Running barefoot over fragrant summer grass - A flop-eared dog barking excitedly beside him . There 'd been endless possibilities to his world back then and infinite time . Pain lanced through his stomach . It had seemed so simple before Dorseter interfered . Now all the alternatives looked wrong . " Only promise I make is to be the champ . " " Maybe there 's more than one race . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " Maybe that 's the possibility you 're afraid of . " " Let it go , Carrie , " he said . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forking pieces of meat , making awkward stabs at conversation , avoiding the one topic on both their minds . He excused himself soon after and went home . And then all at once the fog lifts from his eyes . His body - a magical machine itself - floods with power , at one with the chair that has turned into an elfin carriage . He soars , weightless , free , over the wall that once threatened to defeat him . This is what he lives- for . Nothing can stop him , not even Time itself . He is an eagle breaking out from a cage and leaping up into silky vastness of sky . Exhilarated , he yells . Wind carries his voice away as he sweeps down the course on invisible wings . Crowds , trees , birds , ocean - all fall away . He could go on forever . He is invincible . He has reached the Race Mind . He dreamed of Carries cat and woke in a tangle of sweaty sheets . jerking upright , he reached for the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . The phone rang several times before the surgeon picked it up . Dorseter sounded groggy with sleep . " Jeff ? D' you know what time it is ? " " Two A.M. I got questions . " " Ca n't they wait till morning ? " " You came looking for me , remember ? First question . Why me ? " Dorseter let out a deep sigh . " You need this , Champ . I 'm doing you a favor - If " Bullshit . " " Okay . Try this . You 're high Profile . " " Got it . A photo-op for the Nobel committee . " He was n't surprised . That was life too . You gave and you got back . " Next question . Got ta be risks . Give lem to me . " " Bottom line , the cells might not take . " Dorseter sounded as if he were choosing his words carefully . " Could be a lot of pain and wasted time for nothing . Maybe infection , possibly serious . All medical procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental ones . " " And I 'd be back to square one ? " He heard the hesitation in Dorseter 's reply . " It 's hard to be one hundred percent certain of anything . " He hung up . The FINISH looms , a hundred yards ahead . He flies toward it , whooping with excitement . Everything melts dizzyingly in the bright sunshine . This is what he lives for . This is who he is . The one thing he is certain of . He is a champion . Then he is through the tape . And suddenly the blur of faces waiting for him sharpens . He sees the cameras , the T-shirt vendors , Meg Lowenthal , a child in a wheelchair waving a flag . He sweeps past . Sound bursts roaring on his ears again . The crowd yells , jubilant , huge as the sound of winter surf . Hands reach out toward him as if to catch some of his wild energy for themselves . Carrie is waiting for him behind a barrier . Slowing , he lets go of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fierce exultation . " You made great time , " Carrie says , draping a sweatshirt across his shoulders . She maneuvers her chair beside his as they move away from the FINISH line . The reporters who took Jeff 's picture as he crossed the line turn back to the course where the runners will soon be coming in . The crowd jostles behind the race barriers to catch the first sight of the winners . A few yards away , a TV crew vies with photographers to catch a Hollywood starlet who 's here with her entourage to be seen at the race . The high mood of the race is still on him . He could wheel over , make a photo op . But he senses this one is waiting for a runner . Jeff makes a vee with his fingers to a camera that is n't watching him . Carries van is parked nearby . Exhaustion is catching up with him now . Lungs burn , shoulder muscles ache and his fingers have sprouted blisters . It 's an effort to keep turning the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the way her short brown hair lifts off her brow in the breeze . " This calls for steak and lobster , " she says . " Out of my league , though . " He glances at her , catches the barely hidden smile , and says , " I 'm buying tonight . " " Champagne too . " This end of the parking area , where the handicapped slots are , is almost empty . In the space , two young boys , tired of waiting for something exciting to happen , are playing baseball with a plastic bat . A flop-eared dog runs in circles between them . One of the boys hits high and wide . The yellow tennis ball sails out of reach and comes arcing toward Jeff . " Hey , mister ! " one kid yells . " Get our ball ? " His hand shoots out and cups the ball as it falls . " Nice catch , " Carrie says . He bows in her direction then sends the ball winging back . The dog barks . The kids wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd as the runners begin to cross the FINISH line . He half-turns , his throat tightening . " Ready ? " she asks . The race has to be over , one way or another , someday , he knows that . Nature will see to it if Dorseter does n't . Then what ? And is a man given only one chance to do something with his life , or are there many races over many different courses as Carrie seems to think ? He prides himself on being a tough competitor , sharp-eyed trader in uncertainty . Afraid of nothing . He swings the chair toward the van . Stops again . The wave of excitement and adulation sweeping out from the race buffets him till every nerve in his body thrums with tension and he shuts his eyes against the pain . " Jeff ? " she says . He glances at Carries face . Her face is n't beautiful , but strong . He 's never really looked at it before . He realizes he 's never really looked at any woman before . Maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . He sighs . " I 've made my decision . " She brushes his cheek with her lips but says nothing . He reaches up and touches her short hair . Behind them , the crowd roars again . He wheels up the ramp and into Carries van . <p>
