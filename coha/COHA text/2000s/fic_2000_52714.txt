FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1950 , AMERICANS are leaving a decade behind without the company of Harry " Rabbit " Angstrom , John Updike 's fictional Toyota dealer and former high-school basketball star . Not only is Rabbit dead , he 's been ceremonially interred in Rabbit Angstrom ( 1995 ) , the one-volume Everyman 's Library edition of the four novels that bear his name . In the forty years since the publication of Rabbit , Run , a literary phenomenon that began life as a scandal has achieved a kind of revered , grand-old-man status-still delighting and surprising , certainly selling , but no longer capable of shocking . By 1990 there was something inevitable and almost taken for granted about the Rabbit books , as though Updike owed the world another installment as surely as the world owed Updike another round of awards . The arrival of the next in the series was one of those comforting recurrences like spring or a visit from a favorite uncle . Now , with no further novels to anticipate , we can finally look back and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup game to the sad retiree literally playing his heart out on a dusty Florida playground . <p> To which Rabbit , though , do we look back ? Do we reread the originals or the collected , corrected Rabbit Angstrom ? It 's like trying to decide between the 1881 version and the New York Edition of The Portrait of a Lady . But where Henry James 's late manner superseded his earlier style , charting a new course of indirectness and qualification , Updike 's career , while remarkably varied , follows a more continuous line . His aim with the new edition seems restorative rather than revisionary , the alterations limited mostly to repairing " automotive glitches " ( as he calls his mistakes with cars ) and correcting other minor errors . <p> What astonishes , on rereading the novels in their original versions , is how much Updike got right the first time . To return again and again over decades to a detailed chronicle , picking up where one left off and bringing a unified work to completion , must feel like doing a lifelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , his wife Janice , and son Nelson endure , looking and sounding like the same complex characters ; Updike 's language as well  --  the ever-youthful hero of the tetralogy  --  reverberates through the novels with widely scattered refrains and sly internal references . <p> Sometimes a word or phrase from a major scene is repeated from book to book , as with Rabbit 's surprised " Hey " from his first night with Ruth in Rabbit , Run . Elsewhere a line rings such a faint bell that only a hunch and some backward paging can locate the source . In Rabbit at Rest , for example , Harry contemplates the perfect golf swing , the way the ball makes " a tiny tunnel into the absolute . " " That would be it , " the rapturous paragraph concludes  --  oddly , yet with something familiar about the phrase . Sure enough , in Rabbit , Run Harry hits a gorgeous tee shot , admires the ball 's protracted flight , and exclaims , " That 's it ! " to the minister Jack Eccles , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later in Rabbit , Run , after the birth of the doomed baby , one of the novel 's showier sentences occurs : " Sunshine , the old clown , rims the room . " It reappears verbatim in Rabbit Redux , again placed prominently at the beginning of a section . ( In the new Rabbit Angstrom the echo is clipped to " Sunshine , the old clown "  --  as in the golf epiphany only grazing the ear , stirring memory like a symphony theme . ) <p> Since the novels are narrated , with occasional exceptions , from Rabbit 's expansive point of view , these verbal echoes occur as Harry remembers words of warning , command , joy , and love . He hears his mother whispering " Hassy , " Ruth in bed saying " Work , " and a gruff gas-station attendant telling him , his first time on the road , " The only way to get somewhere , you know , is to figure out where you 're going before you go there . " These catchwords and aphorisms lodge in Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . The wholeness Rabbit feels in his life derives , like the novelistic wholeness wrought by Updike 's brimming language , from a lengthy accretion of verbal textures . <p> When Rabbit , Run first appeared , the explicit sex obliged Updike to consult a lawyer . The threat of legal repercussions had abated by the time of Rabbit Redux , but Updike still wonders if that novel did n't contain a " possibly inordinate emphasis on sexual congress . " The third and fourth installments continued to abound in inventive couplings as Updike explored the variations of desire with a candor still relatively new to mainstream literature . Who can forget , after all , that Harry 's final sexual partner is his daughter-in-law ? <p> Updike has explained that his objective with Rabbit was " a nonjudgmental immersion . " The phrase , from the Rabbit Angstrom introduction , nicely captures what it feels like to witness Harry 's inner life  --  a moist drama that if rendered by a literal-minded director would promptly win an NC-17 rating . And just as Rabbit 's fantasies go uncensored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Updike the neutral , meticulous recorder . Since there 's no telling where a magnetic ex-jock 's appetites will lead , the author , who merely describes events in objective detail , can claim he 's a realist , not a pornographer . <p> But of course Updike 's genius lies in an entirely different sphere , a third category that combines art and blunt description under uneasy labels like " poetic realism . " To read the Rabbit novels from a decade 's distance is to encounter neither a prurient imagination  --  Updike as lecher  --  nor a dispassionate report  --  Updike as lens  --  but an elaborately structured vision of life that encompasses the sleazy and the sublime . In Rabbit Is Rich , home from vacation and the swap night with Thelma Harrison , Harry decides to confront his old lover Ruth about a girl he believes is their daughter . He loses his nerve at the last minute and almost flees : " But as with dying there is a moment that must be pushed through , a slice of time more transparent than plate glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the step , drawing heart from that loving void Thelma had confided to him . " What Harry is psyching himself up with here is an episode of anal sex , depicted graphically twenty pages earlier . His recalling it puts the act in a new light : Does he love Thelma ? Is he merely sentimentalizing their nascent affair ? Is he groping absurdly for anything to bolster his obsessive interrogation of Ruth ? Thus have sexual mechanics joined the vocabulary of the revealing gesture . ( So much for knuckle-cracking and fiddling with ashtrays . ) <p> Despite this now common permissiveness in fiction , Harry 's one-night stand with his son 's wife , Pru , might strain readers ' patience . " This is the worst thing you 've ever done , ever , ever , " cries Janice when she learns of it-and that 's saying something . Presumably we 're meant to keep caring for Harry as he begins his final descent toward Florida and the grave ; but his behavior , in swerving toward the outrageous and extreme , tests not credulity so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural device , Rabbit 's tryst with Pru  --  in the works since Rabbit Is Rich  --  functions perfectly to trigger his symmetrical second flight , the road trip aborted in Rabbit , Run . There is a kind of amoral inner logic to the deed , with Harry just out of the hospital after angioplasty , watching Janice 's real-estate career take off , and Pru back from driving her no-good husband to a drug clinic . Both feel as good as dead , their lives skidding onto some narrow berm where they can at least comfort each other for a night . Immersed in these characters ' converging fates , we can sense how provisional the rules must seem , for Pru as well as for Harry . This night confirms the longstanding affinities between them , affinities that have already called into question the contingent bonds of family . <p> But the strongest justification for the scene , if it needs one , might be the penumbra cast by Harry 's increasingly otherworldly imagination : On returning to Pennsylvania the spring following his heart attack , he drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a block of recently planted pear trees , their blossoms forming " a white tunnel . " While the pedestrians around him bustle on with their lives , Harry stops his car and gets out to admire " the beauty suspended above them , enclosing them , already shedding a confetti of petals : they are in Heaven . " Then Harry drives home , and earthly life resumes . The full extent of Nelson 's drug use and embezzling comes out ; Harry undergoes his heart operation ; and on a rainy night in his mother-in-law 's old house , Pru comes to him : " Her tall pale wide-hipped nakedness in the dimmed room is lovely much as those pear trees in blossom along that block in Brewer last month were lovely , all his it had seemed , a piece of paradise blundered upon , incredible . " <p> Maybe this only shows what can run through a man 's mind while he 's having sex with his daughter-in-law . One could argue that Harry 's thoughts here will naturally be self-serving , throwing a blanket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Harry too long , seen too much of his divided nature , to reduce his meandering associations to this . Something happened to him on that petal-strewn street , and he relives the extraordinary experience while he is with Pru . Could it be that , with the heightened spiritual perception of the dying , he glimpses a divine presence in the very occasion of sin ? <p> If the theological term jars , it should n't . The scene takes us back , like so much else in Rabbit at Rest , to the mysterious world of Rabbit , Run . One of the earliest facts we 're told about Rabbit and Janice is that they , first impressions notwithstanding , are Christians , and the story that follows seems designed to elaborate this statement , exploring senses in which it could conceivably be true , After leaving Janice and making his way back to Brewer , Harry wakes up with Ruth , makes love with her again , says a prayer and starts pestering her about God . Recent movies have inured us to characters who chatter about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in Rabbit , Run Harry sounds like a man with genuine experience , for whom God really is just down the next fairway . Even the minister who adopts him as a personal cause seems to envy Rabbit 's matter-of-fact faith . " Well I do n't know all this about theology , " Harry confesses to Jack Eccles . " I do feel , I guess , that somewhere behind all this .. , there 's something that wants me to find it . " <p> In Rabbit , Run more than in the later novels , Harry is the central problem , the baffling source of all the action . He leaves Janice before we quite know who he is , tells Ruth he loves her when she 's little more to him than a prostitute , returns to Janice for the baby 's birth , and runs again . Where the later novels bulge with events and people to whom Rabbit must respond , Rabbit , Run dwells probingly on Harry himself , introducing others mainly so they can try to figure him out . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystified . " You just wander , do n't you ? " Jack Eccles , sent by Janice 's parents to bring Harry home , winds up on the golf course soliciting his views about God . <p> Updike has said he intended his hero to show the cruelty of unrestrained , Kerouac-inspired romanticism , a temperament that characterizes one side of Rabbit . " All I know is what feels right , " says this selfish , impulsive Harry to Ruth . But because his feelings are torn between the flesh and the spirit , he can also embody what his earthly creator calls " our heart 's stubborn amoral quest for something once called grace . " The novels issue periodic bulletins on this quest of Rabbit 's , monitoring his spiritual state as , in his fashion , he nurses a wavering , unfocused faith . On the night his child is born he stands in the hospital parking lot , praying to the moon . Flying to the tropics with adultery on his mind , he is filled with religious awe : " God , having shrunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisin lost under the car seat , is suddenly great again , everywhere like a radiant wind . " There is nothing phony or hypocritical about these transports of Harry 's . They simply come over him , out of the blue as it were , moving him with the same irresistible force as lust . All he knows is what feels right . <p> The relatively empty , God-haunted universe of Rabbit , Run gives way to the worldly incursions of the later novels : the Apollo II landing of Rabbit Redux , the gas shortage of Rabbit Is Rich , the Pan Am bombing of Rabbit at Rest . AIDS and cocaine add their destructive plot engines , while hurricanes and Super Bowl crowds roar offstage . Harry , who began as a cryptic central presence , diminishes to a ten-year time capsule . We learn what 's on TV , what songs are on the radio , how Mike Schmidt and the Phillies are doing . Harry starts to react with his familiar surly growl  --  rereading Rabbit , Run , one is startled by the boyish voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his sensitive notice . A marked change comes over the novels . Details that once appeared as background , fixing us in time and space , become prominent in their own right . We still get the news and hype through Harry 's point of view , with his opinions as our escort through the cultural landscape , but both the landmarks and the minutiae claim considerable space on their own . <p> Rabbit participates in his inundation  --  rushing to catch the nightly news , annoyed when family duties delay him . The Toyotas he selects for his personal use must have high-quality radios among their features . Yet even as Harry invites the media tide , he resents and fears a dark undercurrent he ca n't help hearing . Vacationing in the Poconos in Rabbit Is Rich , he remembers boyhood summer drives to the Jersey Shore : " Town after town numbingly demonstrated to him that his life was a paltry thing , roughly duplicated by the millions in settings where houses and porches and trees mocking those in Mt . Judge fed the illusions of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisibly cherished . " The older Rabbit gets , the more his soul feels squeezed by multitudinous America . Duplication , it turns out , was just getting warmed up . With his copy of Consumer Reports promising a world of choices , he watches his surroundings collapse into wearying sameness , a boulevard of malls and fast-food chains . His daily joys , robbed of singularity , seem transient as the songs that clog the memories of millions like himself . <p> Harry ca n't endure immersion in the crowd  --  he used to be the crowd 's high-scoring favorite . As an older man he relinquishes local fame , reduced to a benevolent Uncle Sam in a Fourth of July parade , but he still demands some minimal notice , as if proving to himself he exists . He needs the reassurance of " earning his paycheck , filling his slot in the big picture , doing his bit , getting a little recognition . That 's all we want from each other , recognition . " <p> After four lengthy volumes we readers , at least , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his tendency to sneeze , his queasiness about eating animals . We 've been told the address of every place he 's lived . We know the eyebrow cowlick he 's handed down to his son , Nelson , and granddaughter , Judy . These enumerated particulars begin to seem insistent , as if claiming more than the conventional roundedness of fictional characterization . " Here stands ( walks , talks , copulates ) an individual , " say these traits , " despite the best efforts of mass society . " But Harry requires the ultimate recognition , the one he believes in as the ground of all others . To his friend and fellow heart patient Charlie Stavros , who asks what else Harry is but a machine for pumping blood , Harry replies silently , defiantly , " A God-made one-of-a-kind with an immortal soul breathed in . " In a uniform , flattening America of disposable identities , Rabbit calls on a resource that exceeds his traits : his dogged faithfulness in being himself . <p> As Updike observes in the Rabbit Angstrom introduction , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the strange and faraway Rabbit , Run , Rabbit at Rest can feel almost pushily familiar , accosting us with our own obsessive murmurings and daydreams . But the sense of being overrun by brand names and current events might be partly a trick of historical perspective . Compared to Deion Sanders and Toyota slogans , the pop culture of thirty and forty years ago will sound faintly , if at all . The voices buzzing around us might amount to little more than static , but Cheers and Night Court remain , after a little over a decade , our static . Reading the novels in succession , gradually nearing our own time , we see Harry 's world grow larger and more distinct book by book , like an object approaching from beyond the horizon . <p> But what of Harry himself ? To recognize him by his quirks is n't necessarily to know him , and his noisy , garish world , much of it with us still , threatens to obstruct our view of the man . In forty more years , the gleam of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a clearer light , if at a greater distance . Perhaps he 'll join on the remote heights of literature such flawed idealists as Ahab , Hester Prynne , and Huckleberry Finn  --  ambiguous yet unmistakable , repugnant yet beloved . Already Harry seems destined for such an afterlife , with his contradictions , his moral failures redeemed by moral outrage , his American distrust of collective identity . To know and understand these tendencies in Harry  --  loving him one moment , fearing him the next  --  is to recognize ourselves in his disappointed faith , his alert and articulate pain . <p> <p> By David Heddendorf <p>
