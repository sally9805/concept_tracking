Chapter One THE PRESENT MICHAEL WYNDHAM STEPPED OUT OF HIS BEDroom , walked down the hall , and saw his best friend , Derik Gardner , on the main floor headed for the front door . He grabbed the banister and vaulted , dropped fifteen feet , and landed with a solid thud he felt all the way through his knees . " Hey , Derik ! " he called cheerfully . " Wait a sec ! " From his bedroom he heard his wife mutter , " I hate when he does that ... gives me a flippin ' heart attack every time , " and could n't help grinning . Wyndham Manor had been his home all his life , and the only time he walked up or down those stairs was when he was carrying his daughter , Lara . He did n't know how ordinary humans could stand walking around in their fragile little shells . He 'd tried to talk to his wife about this on a few occasions , but her eyes always went flinty , and her gun hand flexed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and things got awkward . Werewolves were tough , incredibly tough , but compared to Homo sapiens , who was n't ? It was a ridiculously perfect day outside , and he could n't blame Derik for wanting to head out as quickly as possible . Still , there was something troubling his old friend , and Michael was determined to get to the bottom of it . " Hold up , " Michael said , reaching forDerik 's shoulder . " I want to- " " I do n't care what you want , " Derik replied without turning . He grabbed Michael 's hand and flung it away , so sharply Michael lost his balance for a second . " I 'm going out . " Michael tried to laugh it off , ignoring the way the hairs on the back of his neck tried to stand up . " Touch-ee ! Hey , I just want to- " " I 'm going out ! " Derik moved , cat-quick , and then Michael was flying through the air with the greatest of ease , only to slam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splinter it down the middle . Michael lay on his back a moment like a stunned beetle . Then he flipped to his feet , ignoring the slashing pain down his back . " My friend , " he said , " you are so right . Except you 're going out on the tip of my boot , pardon me while I kick your ass . " This in a tone of mild banter , but Michael was crossing the room in swift strides , barely noticing that his friend Moira , who had just come in from the kitchen , squeaked and jumped out of the way . Best friend or no , nobody-nobody-knocked the alpha male around in his own ... damned ... house . The other Pack members lived there by his grace and favor , thanks very much , and while the forty-room house had more than enough room for them all , certain things were simply ... not ... done . " Do n't start with me , " Derik warned . The morning sunlight was slanting through the skylight , shining so brightly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames . His friend 's mouth-usually relaxed in a wiseass grin-was a tight slash . His grass-green eyes were narrow . He looked-Michael had trouble believing it-ugly and dangerous . Rogue . " Just stay off . " " You started it , at the risk of sounding junior high , and you 're going to show throat and apologize , or you 'll be counting your broken ribs all the way to the emergency room . " " Come near me again , and we 'll see who 's counting ribs . " " Derik . Last chance . " " Cut it out ! " It was Moira , shrieking from a safe distance . " Do n't do this in his own house , you idiot ! He wo n't stand down , and you two morons-schmucks-losers will hurt each other ! " " Shut up , " Derik said to the woman he ( usually ) lovingly regarded as a sister . " And get lost ... this is n't for you . " " I 'm getting the hose , " she warned , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Moira , out , " Michael said without looking around . She was a fiercely intelligent female werewolf who could knock over an elm if she needed to , but she was no match for two males squaring off . The day was headed down the shit hole already ; he would n't see Moira hurt on top of it . " And Derik , she 's right , let 's take this outside-ooooof ! " He did n't duck , though he could see the blow coming . He should have ducked , but ... he still could n't believe what was happening . His best friend-Mr . Nice Guy himself ! - was challenging his authority . Derik , always the one to jolly people out of a fight . Derik , who had Michael 's back in every fight , who had saved his wife 's life , who loved Lara like she was his own . The blow-hard enough to shatter an ordinary man 's jaw-knocked him back a full three steps . And that was that . Allowances had been made , but now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could sense other people filling the room , but it faded to an unimportant drone . Derik gave up trying for the door and slowly turned . It was like watching an evil moon come over the horizon . He glared , full in the face : a dead-on challenge for dominance . Michael grabbed for his throat , Derik blocked , they grappled . A red cloud of rage swam across Michael 's vision ; he did n't see his boyhood friend , he saw a rival . A challenger . Derik was n't giving an inch , was shoving back just as hard , warning growls ripping from his throat , growls that only fed Michael 's rage ( rival ! rival for your mate , your cub ! show throat or die ! ) made him yearn to twist Derik 's head off , made him want to pound , tear , hurt-Suddenly , startlingly , a small form was between them . Was shoving , hard . Sheer surprise broke them apart . " Daddy ! Quit it ! " Lara stood between them , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His daughter was standing protectively in front of Derik . Not that Derik cared , or even noticed ; his gaze was locked on Michael 's : hot and uncompromising . Jeannie , frozen at the foot of the stairs , let out a yelp and lunged toward her daughter , but Moira moved with the speed of an adder and flung her arms around the taller woman . This earned her a bellow of rage . " Moira , what the hell ? Let go ! " " You ca n't interfere , " was the small blonde 's quiet reply . " None of us can . " Although Jeannie was quite a bit taller and heavier , the smaller woman had no trouble holding Jeannie back . Jeannie was the alpha female , but human-the first human alpha the Pack had known in three hundred years . Moira would follow almost any command Jeannie might make ... but would n't let the woman endanger herself , or interfere with Pack law that was as old as the family of Man . Oblivious to the drama on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet . " Quit it , Derik ! " She swung her small foot into Derik 's shin , which he barely noticed . " And Daddy , you quit , too . Leave him alone . He 's just sad and feeling stuck . He does n't want to hurt you . " Michael ignored her . He was glaring at his rival and reaching for Derik again , when his daughter 's voice cut through the tension like a laser scalpel . " I said leave him alone . " That got his attention ; he looked down at her in a hurry . He expected tears , red-faced anger , but Lara 's face was , if anything , too pale . Her eyes were huge , so light brown they were nearly gold . Her dark hair was pulled back in two curly pigtails . He realized anew how tall she was for her age , and how she was her mother 's daughter . And her father 's . Her gaze was direct , adult . And not a little disconcerting . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody moved . It seemed nobody even breathed . And Derik was standing down , backing off , heading for the door . Michael , in light of these highly interesting new events , let him go . He employed his best Annoyed Daddy tone . " What did you say , Lara ? " She did n't flinch . " You heard me . But you wo n't hear me say it again . " He was furious , appalled . This wasn't-he had to-she couldn't-But pride was rising , blotting out the fury . Oh , his Lara ! Intelligent , gorgeous-and utterly without fear ! Would he have ever dared face down his father ? It occurred to him that the future Pack leader was giving him an order . Now what to do about it ? A long silence passed , much longer in retrospect . This would be a moment his daughter would remember if she lived to be a thousand . He could break her ... or he could start training a born leader . He bowed stiffly . He did n't show the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal . " A wiser head has prevailed . Thank you , Lara . " He turned on his heel and walked toward the stairs , catching Jeannie 's hand on the way up , leaving the others behind . Moira had released her grip on his wife , was staring , openmouthed , at Lara . They were all staring . He did n't think it had ever been so quiet in the main hall . Michael was intent on reaching his bedroom where he could think about all that had just happened , and gain his wife 's counsel . He did n't quite dare go after Derik just yet-best to take time for their blood to cool . Christ ! It was n't even eight o'clock in the morning ! " Mikey-what-cripes- " And Lara . His daughter , who jumped between two werewolves with their blood up . Who faced him down and demanded he leave off . His daughter , defending her dearest friend . His daughter , who had just turned four . They had known she was ferociously intelligent , but to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was-Jeannie cut through his thoughts with a typically wry understatement . " This ca n't be good . But I 'm sure you can explain it to me . Use hand puppets . And me without my So You Married a Werewolf guide ... " Then he was closing their bedroom door and thinking about his place in the Pack , and his daughter 's , and how he hoped he would n't have to kill his best friend before the sun set .
