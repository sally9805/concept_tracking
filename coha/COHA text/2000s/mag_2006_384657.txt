It was a grade-nine pool party , late in June . The kids had a hall , hut by suppertime about half of them were sporting obvious sunhurns . It 's not that sunscreen or shaded areas were n't available . It 's that nobody used them . How come ? Why are the kids who grew up with " Slip , Slap , Slop " so cavalier about sun exposure once they hit their teens ? Last year 's survey from the American Academy of Dermatology confirmed that teens are much less careful than adults about sun exposure , even though most know that suntanning and especially sunburns increase the risk for skin cancer . More than half of teens surveyed said they are " not too careful or not at all careful " to protect their skin . Is it because they still buy into the glamour of a tan ? For some , yes . Most teen survey correspondents agreed that people look better with a tan , and tanning beds are reportedly quite popular among teen girls . But the worst offenders are boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . And while some boys may actually aspire to the bronze-god look , it seems likely that most just do n't want to be bothered with it . At an age when kids just want to pick up and go , the sun routine may , in fact , seem like a fussy remnant from childhood . They do n't want to take the five minutes to be " gooped up " before they head out the door . It 's a problem , though , and not just for their middle-aged skin health . The Canadian Dermatology Association reports that they are now seeing basalcell skin cancer , formerly a disease of middle and old age , in young adults and even teens . So how can we encourage kids to play it smart in the sun ? We asked three experts : Cheryl Rosen , head of dermatology at Toronto Western Hospital and chair of the National Sun Safety Committee , public health nurse Lucia Brcsolin of Toronto Public Health and the Ontario Sun Safety Work Group , and paediatrician Danielle Grenier , Canadian Paediatric Society medical affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems a long way off to most kids . " Of course , I still say it increases the risk of skin cancer , " says Grenier . " But once I start talking about aging skin and wrinkles , that hits better . " The same girls who think they 'll look better with a tan may think twice when they hear , " The more you tan , the more you 're going to wrinkle . " Make it easy . For those who think it 's " too much trouble , " keep a hat and sunglasses by the door along with a sunscreen and SPF lip balm small enough to pop in a pocket . Grab " em and go . A family-sized container of sunscreen in the bathroom beside the toothpaste can become part of the morning routine . Get stuff they like . " You just ca n't convince a teenager to wear a hat with a wide brim . Do n't even try , " says Rosen . If he 'll wear a baseball cap , close the deal ! Same with sunglasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . Many teens object to the sticky feel , and others worry it may make their face break out . Kids prone to acne or too impatient to slather up may prefer a spray . Lighterweight " non-greasy " formulas are available as well as sunscreens specifically for the face . Lobby for shade and sun awareness . " It would be great if your kid 's soccer league played its games at nine and 10 in the morning and after 3 , " says Rosen . The reality is that tournaments are all day and schoolyards are essentially sun-baked fields , but maybe that can change . Practise what you preach . Yes , it makes a difference . " Kids do listen , " says Bresolin , citing studies about parents ' smoking habits and other health messages that show that what we do really does modify kids ' behaviour . Encourage self-acceptance . Years of equating a tan with health and beauty are now standing in the way of true skin health . We have to help our kids get over that , says Rosen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin colour you were born with . " HB Sidebar Does a Tan Give Protection ? Your child might like to think so But dermatologist Cheryl Rosen says an acquired tan only provides an SPF of 2 or 4 - it 's hardly significant . By contrast , she says , the natural pigment in black or dark brown skin gives much better protection against burning and skin cancer ( though not wrinkles ) . SPF lip balm and sunglasses ( UV exposure can lead to cataracts ) are still important , though , as well as sunscreen for longer periods of sun exposure . // <p>
