Section : MEDICINE &; HEALTH <p> FEW SECTORS of the economy have provided more benefits to consumers than the pharmaceutical industry . Drugmakers have been vilified by patients and politicians alike , however , because of what they see as unreasonably high drug costs . Yet , medicine is not the most important component of the recent rise in health care expenses . Moreover , the primary reason for current increases in total drug cost is that more and more people are using newer medicines  --  which means that consumer are rising even faster . <p> Simplistic comparisons between drug costs in the U.S. and those in other countries have little value . Economic wealth , exchange rates , product liability rules , price controls , and other factors all contribute to the price of drugs . More important , prices for U.S. pharmaceuticals are not excessive relative to the benefits they offer . Drugs have contributed to the sharp reduction in mortality rates from many diseases , including AIDS . Pharmaceuticals also reduce the cost of alternative treatments . Thus , restricting access to the newest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way to develop new drugs is to invest heavily in research and development . The $30,000,000,000 spent annually by U.S. drugmakers dwarfs the budget of the National Institutes of Health and investments by foreign drug companies . Profits of U.S. firms tend to be high , but not uniformly so , and they create a " virtuous cycle " that encourages more research and development to create groundbreaking medicine . <p> Yet , industry critics propose everything from socialized medicine to price controls and limits on patents . Such measures would reduce incentives to create new medicines . It is true that some people , especially poor individuals in less-developed countries , lack sufficient access to pharmaceuticals . Private charity at home and abroad should make them more available to those who are most in need , and Washington should include a drug benefit as part of overall Medicare reform . In the meantime , states should help needy seniors through limited pharmaceutical access programs . In addition , policymakers must avoid taking steps that would , intentionally or not , wreck a world-leading industry and deny people access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lives to new products that emerge on a regular basis from the pharmaceutical industry . In the coming years , genetic research is likely to dramatically expand the benefits of pharmaceutical R &D.; One might fairly expect most people , especially those who are ill , to be grateful . However , demonstrators around the world are targeting the pharmaceutical industry , apparently for daring to sell the AIDS drugs that it created at high cost . The tome for the war on " Big Pharma " was set in the 2000 presidential race , when then-Vice Pres. Al Gore campaigned against drugmakers with faux populist rhetoric : " Big tobacco , big oil , the big polluters , the pharmaceutical companies , the HMOs , sometimes you have to be willing to stand up and say no , so families can have a better life . " It was an astonishing comparison that equated companies that make life-saving products with those that often are accused of harming consumers . Yet , in the same speech , the Vice President acknowledged " a time of almost unimaginable medical breakthroughs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although George W. Bush won the election , his Administration largely abandoned its defense of drug patents at later meetings of the World Trade Organization . In the fall of 2001 , Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson implicitly threatened to override Bayer 's patent for Cipro if the company did not sharply cut the drug 's price during negotiations to purchase a large quantity for protection against the new threat of anthrax bioterrorism . <p> Legislators have been even more hostile . Rep. Bernard Sanders ( I-Vt. ) argues that because people ca n't afford necessary drugs , " many are suffering and even dying . " Instead of lauding drugmakers for preventing pain and death , he blames them for causing these things . State officials voice similar criticism . West Virginia governor Bob Wise says that pharmaceutical prices are " outrageous " and warns that big , brand-name drug companies are " going to be spreading lies and half-truths " in response to his state government 's efforts to control the prices they charge . <p> On what seems to be a daily basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for various forms of price controls , patent invalidations , and advertising restrictions . The hunt is on for more generous drug benefits at lower prices . A potentially unprecedented expansion of the Medicare entitlement in the form of prescription drug benefits has become the top domestic policy issue in Congress . Whether those benefits will be managed in private competitive markets or subjected to centralized price controls remains to be seen . State legislators faced with bloated Medicaid program budgets have latched onto high drug prices as the key culprit . The political appetite for increased Medicare and Medicaid drug benefits shows no sign of abating . Many officeholders hope to feed it with a steady diet of mandatory price ceilings , weakened patent rights , and restrictive drug formularies ( lists of covered and preferred drugs ) . Increasingly , policymakers treat the innovative drug industry like apolitical piata  --  whacking it with accusations and threats while expecting it to yield its treasured prizes . <p> Others fault drug companies for advertising their wares too directly and aggressively to consumers , claiming that such advertising merely increases purchases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over cheaper and older ones . Many drugmakers also are accused of exploiting legal loopholes to extend their patented drug monopolies well beyond reasonable bounds . <p> Even in the aftermath of the fall 2002 elections , which restored Republican Party control of both Houses of Congress and a marginally more favorable Capitol Hill climate for the pharmaceutical industry , the crusade against drug companies continues . The heat is still on brand-name drugmakers to yield more of their profits and the patent rights that protect them so that generic imitators can flood the market with lower-cost versions of today 's drugs and officeholders can dispense them more widely to public health program beneficiaries . <p> Whether the issues ahead are indirect price controls , coerced " discounts , " dilution of patent rights , reimportation of U.S.-manufactured drugs from lower-priced foreign markets , or just plain old-fashioned political scapegoating , the common focus is to force down prices . Under one guise or another , government would confiscate revenue from firms , in effect seizing their property . <p> With government outlays accounting for more than 45% of all health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private health insurance premiums ) , soaring drug costs weigh heavily on Federal and state budgets , encouraging legislators to clamp down . For example , Medicaid spending for outpatient drugs increased by an average of 18.1% per year from 1997 to 2000 , compared to 7.7% for total Medicaid expenditures . Officeholders would prefer to offer even more generous drug benefits to their citizens , but without asking them to pay most , if not all , of the costs . <p> The trouble is , some of their constituents are accustomed to insurance coverage for most other forms of medical care that , from an insured person 's perspective , appears to be largely free , and they therefore complain about rising out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs . In particular , the traditional Medicare program does not provide outpatient prescription drug benefits , and even other supplemental private insurance coverage for seniors requires significant copayments and cost sharing . Approximately one-third of all Medicare seniors lack any insurance coverage for outpatient prescription drugs . Unless they qualify for subsidized drug discount cards or state-based assistance programs , seniors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay cash to meet the highest retail prices in the marketplace . <p> More recently , even workers and families with private insurance coverage for prescription drugs increasingly see themselves at greater financial risk . Pressured by the rising costs of health plan benefits , their employers and health insurers are asking them to share more of the costs of prescription drugs by paying higher copayments when they fill prescriptions for brand name ( nongeneric ) drugs . Thus , many patients are more likely to know when pharmaceuticals cost more , even if they otherwise pay little or no attention to higher charges by doctors and hospitals that are covered by comprehensive third-party insurance . This disparate treatment in health care expenditures increases sensitivity to rising drug prices and fuels political demands for expanded coverage and lower prices . <p> Alas , drug industry critics have gotten the issue almost entirely wrong , from the statistics they cite to the solutions they promote . Their insistence on crude government intervention to lower drug prices , rather than dynamic market-based innovations to improve our overall health , risks killing the goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions , prescription drugs are not the driving force behind rising health care costs . In fact , hospital care costs were the most important component of rising health care expenses in 2001 , accounting for 51% of the increase . Nor are costs rising so fast because drugmakers are hiking prices . It only seems so because , as the old adage goes , if you torture statistics long enough , they will confess to anything . Improved quality of life <p> A narrow emphasis on the cost of prescription drugs is misguided . Prices can not be debated in isolation . Drugs do not simply represent unnecessary-expenses that need to be controlled ( although medical professionals are as apt as patients to think in these terms ) . Even though the steadily increasing demand for drugs drives up their prices and overall cost , that demand reflects the premium that Americans place on improved well-being . Consumers demand pharmaceuticals because they offer enormous benefits . Some 400 new drugs ended up on the market during the 1990s because people desired them , just as they wanted thousands of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autos , SUVs , and much , much more . The highest-priced drugs do not represent luxury goods ; they address serious and painful conditions . About half of the $22,500,000,000 increase in retail drug spending in 2001 occurred among just nine categories of medicines  --  those used to treat depression , high cholesterol , diabetes , arthritis , high blood pressure , pain , allergies , ulcers , and other gastrointestinal ailments . <p> There are 122 drugs under development for heart diseases and strokes . Another 256 medicines will target infectious diseases of all sorts , including hepatitis , pneumonia , staph infections , and sexually transmitted diseases like herpes and gonorrhea . A number of vaccines , ranging from improved polio compounds to new treatments to prevent cocaine addiction , Alzheimer 's , and traveler 's diarrhea , are in process as well . Drugs also are being developed to combat conditions such as high cholesterol , psoriasis , ' and obesity . Even something as simple as an antihistamine to ameliorate an allergy for cat hair can dramatically improve the quality of life . One can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address more than 30 diseases that disproportionately afflict women . <p> By one estimate , new prescription drugs accounted for 45% of the variation of the reduction in mortality among different diseases between 1970 and 1991 . Longevity has increased seven years since 1960 alone . According to Columbia University Graduate School of Business professor Frank Lichtenberg , " On average , each new drug approved during the period 1970-91 is estimated to have saved 11,200 life-years ... " and presumably continued to do so in subsequent years . Medicines do more than extend lives , though . They improve the quality of lives  --  not just the patients ' , but those of their family members and other caregivers . Pharmaceutical products provide economic benefits , too . They reduce medical expenditures by , for example , lowering the rate of hospitalizations , surgeries , and other invasive medical treatments . <p> Since new , better , and more expensive medicines are considered to be a problem , American politicians have come up with a host of counterproductive " solutions . " The most common is price controls , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and expanding taxpayer-financed subsidies . <p> Price controls can be direct or indirect . Certain proposals would link U.S. prices to foreign levels ; others would limit the costs of drugs purchased as part of Federal or state programs . Some creative state legislators would bring the nonpoor under Medicaid , which imposes price controls on pharmaceuticals . <p> Most countries other than the U.S. are quite strict in that they regulate the prices of drugs , whether directly through price controls , or indirectly through limits on reimbursements under social insurance programs or through profit controls imposed on drug companies . Any form of price restriction tends to be inherently arbitrary and generates a host of unintended consequences . Whatever the official criteria of the price control regime , warns John Calfee of the American Enterprise Institute , " decisions would be dominated by political forces , including managed care organizations , domestic versus foreign manufacturers , patient groups , insurance firms , employee benefit managers , labor unions , and other advocacy groups . " <p> The general case against price controls is clear . Their experience running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , depress supply , create shortages , shift activity to unregulated sectors , and encourage wasteful avoidance and evasion activity . They also inevitably drift toward more complicated controls , entrench vested interests , take on a life of their own , and become extremely difficult to dismantle . Massive waiting lists , care delayed and denied , disincentives for research and development , and limited access to new technologies and treatments are standard . <p> Yet , Sanders complains that " in Vermont and all over the United States , alone among industrialized nations , the drug companies can charge any price they want for their product  --  no matter what the consequence . " Many legislators at the Federal and state level would change that . <p> In 2000 , Congress passed legislation that would have allowed reimportation from foreign markets of drugs originally produced in the U.S. Although Pres. Bill Clinton signed the Medicine Equity and Safety Act into law , Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala blocked implementation of its reimportation provision because she could not certify ( as required by the legislation ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in significantly lower prices . Supporters of reimportation returned to the issue during the 107th Congress , focusing on reimportation from Canada or other highly industrialized countries that would raise fewer concerns over counterfeit or poor-quality imports . In July , 2001 , Thompson reaffirmed the Shalala decision , and congressional efforts to enact revised versions of reimportation authority fell short . <p> Reimportation policies for drug sales would effectively apply foreign price controls on the American market . Accurate comparisons of drug costs in different countries are difficult and rare , because drug price data reflect other nations ' relative wealth levels , their fluctuating currency values , the degree to which their health care systems are politicized and their drug prices regulated , their relative mix of generic versus brand-name drugs , and the consumption patterns of their citizens . <p> Attempting to regulate prices is not the answer . A uniform international price would be impossible to sustain . Exchange rate vagaries would quickly create radical price divergences in many cases . Trying to maintain uniformity would not only be administratively difficult , it would be economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market within which it is selling . <p> Remember , too , that U.S. citizens  --  despite what many critics and politicians assert  --  are not paying higher prices to subsidize foreign consumers . Pharmaceutical companies are profit-maximizing businesses that base their prices on local supply and demand . As long as they can cover the marginal cost of selling an additional pill overseas , they will do so . However , they will not keep selling at a loss in another country no matter how abundant their primary market ( in the U.S. ) remains . Medicaid medications <p> In recent years , many states have been hard pressed to keep their budgets under control . Tax revenues have declined as the economy worsened , but outlays have continued to rise . The state share of Medicaid program expenditures , and prescription drug spending in particular , is one of the fastest growing components of state budgets . Not surprisingly , many state legislators , seeking a quick fix , have targeted for special attention the highly visible prices that their Medicaid programs pay for prescription drugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk purchasing power of state agencies ( or even voluntary compacts of several states ) and limited to regular participants in state-funded programs , the process resembles normal bargaining by organized purchasers that occurs elsewhere in the marketplace . However , most of the state-based Medicaid discounts are mandatory and , unlike market-driven rebates , they are not negotiated on the basis of the demonstrated ability of a particular state Medicaid program to move market share from one manufacturer 's drugs to those of a competitor . <p> Also , several states have moved well beyond that to attempt to impose far-reaching price controls that could jeopardize incentives for innovative drug development and reduce access to high quality health care for their Medicaid beneficiaries . In search of much deeper price concessions , they are threatening to restrict access to Medicaid reimbursement through tight formularies and by unilaterally imposing price cuts on rebates . <p> To the extent that state efforts take hold and artificially reduce prices , they will have the same effect as any other politically mandated price control . Although one small state would have only a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coalition of several large states might create a system approximating national price controls . Diane Rowland , executive director of the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured , observes , " Alone , they can be picked off , but if they stand together , they can win . " They can win , that is , if winning is defined as plucking the pharmaceutical goose , even if doing so eventually kills it . <p> States , it must be understood , can play a constructive role in making prescription drugs affordable for lower-income seniors without extending the reach of take-it-or-leave-it price controls . Quite simply , they should aid those most in need . The best vehicle for such assistance is a senior pharmaceutical assistance program that uses subsidies , discounts , or both , usually targeted at the indigent elderly . The oldest such initiatives at the state level go back to 1975 . Today , 35 states have plans , though their eligibilities and benefits differ . Such programs should be strictly limited to those in need : In 2001 , just over eight percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceuticals . The average senior spends more than twice as much on entertainment than on medicine . <p> Other state-based initiatives might include tax credits for drug purchases , buyers ' clubs , and cooperatives . Education also is a vital tool : a half-dozen states engage in " counter-detailing " efforts that encourage , but do not require , doctors who prescribe more expensive drugs to consider alternatives . <p> The traditional incentive used to attract capital for running the arduous , costly , and risky enterprise of life-saving drug development has been the granting of exclusive patent rights by the Federal government . Patents provide monopoly rights to sell and license innovative drug products for a limited number of years . Winners in the race to innovate count on the potentially high profits protected by patents to cover their sunk costs of research and development and to replenish their capital for future rounds of drug discovery efforts . Patents play a disproportionately important role in the drug industry . The share of inventions introduced because of patent protection is eight times higher in pharmaceuticals than in a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't work because exclusive patent rights last too long , limit competition , and lead to excessive economic concentration . In fact , the pharmaceutical industry is remarkably open and competitive , comprising 650 companies , none of which holds more than 11% of the worldwide market . The top 10 firms account for no more than 60% of sales . <p> Another fundamental assault on the pharmaceutical industry comes from those who would strip patent protection from drugs that generate the most social benefits . Some would erode patent rights to accelerate the market entry of lower-priced generic drug alternatives ; others would do so to reduce the price of medicines that could counteract bioterrorism ; and still others would do so to combat AIDS and other serious diseases in less-developed countries . <p> Patents give their owners the right to exclude others from making , using , or selling an invention for a fixed period of time . Drug manufacturers are in a unique position in that they can not sell their patented products until they have successfully completed clinical trials and received Food and Drug Administration approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years have triggered various complaints about brand-name companies exploiting legal loopholes to extend the patent life of their higher-priced drugs and delay competition from makers of cheaper generic drugs . <p> The Federal government 's efforts to find a political balance between encouraging competition and allowing competition become more complex when its patent enforcement role collides with its financial stake as a major purchaser of prescription drugs . The temptation is to renege on its previously promised patent protection in order to arbitrarily drive down the prices it pays . Nevertheless , the only legitimate course of action is to consistently protect the regime of limited monopoly rights ( patents ) that it created . Federal officials should not get caught up in the fine-tuning , legal wrangling , and game playing over the terms and conditions of patents for innovative drugs . Policymakers should instead more consistently guarantee a set of fixed but limited terms for drug patents and thereby encourage the continued availability of investment capital needed for productive drug development . <p> Consider the Federal government 's recent approach to the drug industry 's role in the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist attacks , analysts warned about anthrax , botulism , equine encephalitis , hemorrhagic fevers ( such as Ebola ) , plague , ricin , smallpox , and tularemia . Washington began devoting resources to creating vaccines and treatments . The obvious policy step should have been to turn loose the drug companies as well . " You have a huge science-based industry that is not aimed properly , " maintains Martin Rosenberg , a retired scientist with GlaxoSmithKline : " The government simply must put the right carrot in front of the companies . " That carrot should be patents , which allow firms to profit from their research . The prospect of a reasonable return is necessary given the enormous expense required  --  as much as $50,000,000,000 over the next five to 10 years , according to one estimate  --  to provide " substantial protection against most threats . " <p> Of course , uncertainty about future demand for more esoteric treatments and vaccines might discourage companies from spending heavily to develop such new products . Vaccines directed at bioterrorism have not generated much enthusiasm among venture capitalists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have substantial value , government could provide an incentive for private production  --  not only purchasing a stockpile but , if necessary , subsidizing the creation of manufacturing facilities . In the case of vaccines that might protect citizens against bioterror threats like smallpox , Washington should foster the products ' general availability rather than lock them away in a government stockpile . Individuals then could decide in a noncrisis atmosphere whether or not to get vaccinated in advance , balancing the risks and benefits . That said , one must be wary of the serious difficulties that are likely to arise from government-industry partnerships in the development , in contrast to supply and distribution , of drugs . <p> In his State of the Union Address in January , Pres. Bush announced that a new initiative called Project BioShield would guarantee up to $6,000,000,000 in permanent funding over the next 10 years to develop and make available drugs and vaccines to protect against biological and chemical weapons . The proposal would begin to address the need for stable procurement incentives to encourage innovative private sector development of medical countermeasures against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also would provide greater flexibility to the FDA to accelerate the availability of promising countermeasures and authorize their use in an emergency . Regrettably , the Federal government 's clumsy response to a series of anthrax-related bioterror attacks in the fall of 2001 and its heavy-handed treatment of the makers of Cipro already may have undercut the incentive for future private undertakings . Cipro , used to treat inhaled anthrax , is Bayer A.G. 's largest-selling product , generating revenue of $1,600,000,000 a year . Cipro exists because of private R &D.; Priced at between five and seven dollars a pill , the five-day regimen , followed by use of other , cheaper antibiotics , would cost between $50 and $70 , hardly an excessive price for a life-saving product . Still , shortly after the first wave of anthrax threats surfaced , the Canadian government rushed to strip Bayer of its patent and approved production of a generic substitute . Similar threats soon emanated from Congress . Although Thompson later denied that he had planned to divest Bayer of its patent , that was the common perception based on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public pressure that caused Bayer to sharply cut its price for Uncle Sam . <p> Business Week reporters John Carey and Amy Barrett noted : Thompson highlighted the fact that Cipro costs about 10 times as much as equally effective drugs ; he emboldened Brazil and other countries to break patents to lower drug costs , and he set a worrisome precedent for future government meddling in the cost of medicines . If a free-market Republican Administration can force Bayer to cut its price , how will the government be able to resist stepping in when the soaring cost of a future Medicare drug benefit threatens to break the bank ? <p> Such highly visible efforts to weaken patent rights for short-term gains undermine the incentive to create additional treatments and develop drugs to combat other potentially lethal diseases . This is particularly curious behavior when the U.S. government is otherwise working with private drugmakers to develop new and improved anthrax vaccines ; pharmaceutical companies are ransacking their shelves for compounds that might be effective against new diseases ; and researchers are attempting to develop new means to detect and treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reforming Medicare <p> Ideally , long-term Medicare reform would transform the program so that it offeres seniors a choice among competing plans that includes pharmaceutical benefits . It would encourage private insurers to assemble packages of integrated , linked benefits that produce the greatest value for both beneficiaries and taxpayers by coordinating efficient tradeoffs among drugs , surgery , hospitalization , and outpatient care options . Beneficiaries then could choose the plan options that were best tailored to meet their respective needs and preferences . <p> The Medicare+Choice ( M+C ) program , launched in 1997 , provides a limited amount of private health plan choice . However , its rates of participation  --  by both insurers and beneficiaries  --  have dropped precipitously in recent years . Roughly 12% of Medicare participants are enrolled in M+C plans . They generally receive more generous levels of drug coverage , but those benefits are increasingly jeopardized by flawed Medicare payment formulas . <p> Congress must begin with a clean slate and proceed to eliminate the uncertainties and excesses of its complex regulatory requirements , time limits , and payment methodologies for the faltering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from an antiquated defined benefit structure ( which covers a specific set of health services ) to a defined contribution model , under which seniors could choose among competing packages of health benefits with taxpayers ' costs capped at preset levels . It is crucial that the traditional Medicare fee-for-service coverage program be required to improve by competing for market share on a level playing field . One necessary element includes a payment system whereby private plans bid to provide required benefits ; beneficiaries capture the savings from choosing less-costly options ; and the government 's share of Medicare funding reflects the enrollment-weighted average costs of the mandatory benefits provided in all plans ( including traditional Medicare ) . Seniors seeking additional supplemental benefits would pay higher premiums that reflect their marginal costs . Medicare beneficiaries who accepted greater individual responsibility would be rewarded with broader health coverage choices and possible cash rebates . <p> Defined contribution payments must be determined by competitive market prices rather than remain linked to the politically driven and bureaucratically administered price controls of the traditional Medicare program . Competitive bidding mechanisms and reasonable ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current program 's maze of distorted prices and poor information . <p> A more far-reaching , but much longer-term Medicare reform proposal idea would redirect a portion of younger workers ' Medicare tax payments into Personal Retirement Insurance for Medical Expenses  --  tax-advantaged savings vehicles that could be used to prefund insurance and health care expenses during retirement . However , an initial round of the intermediate reform measures to restore competitive private health plan options for seniors , as suggested above , would first be needed to realign the current Medicare structure before it could be transformed into a more fully privatized system of health care choices for seniors . Transitional finance issues may slow the evolution toward this ultimate objective , but a full return to individual responsibility and private-sector health care offers the only long-term hope for surmounting the perennial chronic financial crises and bureaucratic morasses of Medicare as we know it . <p> If Congress can not resist the urge to add drug benefits without tackling fundamental Medicare reform , it should at least do less harm by emphasizing higher deductibles and catastrophic loss protection for prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reformed coverage options for individual Medigap insurance purchasers . Under no circumstances should the door be opened to universal subsidies to seniors for routine , manageable drug expenses . Advertising drugs <p> Some industry critics want to control drug costs by restricting industry spending , especially on marketing . A particular target is direct-to-consumer ( DTC ) advertising . Some health care benefits managers complain that DTC ads cause excessive use of prescription drugs or that they steer consumers toward more expensive brand-name drugs . During congressional consideration of a proposed new Medicare benefit for prescription drugs , some legislators ( including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas , R.-Calif. ) toyed with proposals to limit corporate tax deductions for prescription drug advertising expenses , on the theory that DTC ads would unnecessarily increase Federal drug spending . <p> Pharmaceutical marketing accounted for $13,800,000,000 in 1999 . Yet , more than half of that  --  $7,200,000,000  --  was for free samples of drugs , which serve as a discount when doctors pass them out to patients . Most of the rest went for professional advertising and promotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals  --  physicians , opticians , and attorneys  --  have long used advertising restrictions to squelch competition and maintain high fees . <p> Disseminating information about new pharmaceuticals is an important mechanism for letting patients and doctors know what is available . One estimate is that more than 1,700 articles are published every year in each of 325 professional journals on the 25 leading medications . Marketing helps professionals keep afloat in this information flood . Moreover , what company in America makes a product and tells no one about it ? Imagine General Motors developing a new car and keeping it secret . <p> The amount of mass media advertising directly aimed at patients remains relatively low  --  $2,800,000,000 in 2001 , not much more than two percent of pharmaceutical sales . Yet , it has increased dramatically over the last decade , up from just $55,000,000 in 1991 . Such advertising undoubtedly helps increase demand . That , in turn , has raised drug expenditures  --  treated by some bill payers as a negative in and of itself . However , people use medicines because the benefits exceed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unprofitable . Thus , advertising does not compete with R &D; rather , the two are complementary . Marketing hikes revenues and investment returns , making more money available for and increasing incentive for research and development . Even as drugmakers advertise , they devote a larger share of sales to R &D; than does the medical industry generally . <p> Another criticism of DTC marketing is that ads are irrelevant or misleading , causing patients to demand products that are not good for them . As in any industry , ads vary in quality . Doctors remain a gatekeeper , though , often prescribing other brands , generics , older products , or nothing . Apparently some physicians begrudge their patients an explanation . Dr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer of Emory University denounced drug ads because , " Not only do we have to take time to explain to these patients the nature of the medical problem they have , and whether it needs to be treated with drugs , but we also have to discuss whether the drug they have seen promoted is their best option . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to say no to be unpleasant , but their role , after all , is to serve patients , and they should be prepared to explain why a particular advertised drug is not appropriate . <p> In fact , advertising can play an important role in informing and empowering patients . That may be one reason why the American Medical Association has suggested that the government ban ads . Expanded knowledge is particularly important in what traditionally has been a physician-led process : Patients can ask better questions and make better judgments if they know some of the options available . <p> The fact that the typical " solutions " to reduce pharmaceutical prices would make Americans worse off does not mean that nothing should be done in response to concerns over access and cost . Some people of limited means have trouble getting the drugs that they need . A wealthy and compassionate society should respond . <p> The principle that should govern any action , private or public , is " first do no harm . " Government should not interfere with a pharmaceutical maker that works as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , remedies should be narrowly targeted to meet genuine needs . <p> The current political spotlight on prescription drug prices has drawn attention away from a more important issue  --  regulatory barriers to the availability of the best medicine . The most unaffordable and unavailable drugs are those that carry no price tag , because the FDA keeps them off the market . The starting point for improving access to the drugs of today and tomorrow should be reducing government barriers that inflate development costs and thus the eventual market prices . <p> The FDA must certify prescription medicines for both safety and efficacy . The latter requirement was passed after the thalidonide scare in 1962 . In the absence of that unnecessary mandate , drug companies still would have no incentive to sell ineffective products ; doctors would have no incentive to prescribe them ; and patients would have no incentive to buy them . Although regulatory efficacy requirements may not have significantly improved the overall quality of prescription drugs , they certainly have lengthened the time necessary to win approval of them and limited their availability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drugs , and Cosmetic Act effectively shifted primary decisionmaking authority in pharmaceuticals from market mechanisms to a centralized regulatory authority . <p> By 1967 , the average review time for a drug application had more than tripled from its pre-1962-amendments level . Congress ' bias toward regulation exacerbated the agency 's natural bureaucratic tendency to be risk averse : To approve a drug that is either ineffective or harmful would hurt one 's career far more than holding up approval of efficacious , helpful products . The delays obviously were costly : Total development costs per successful drug more than doubled between 1963-75 and 1970-82 . By the 1980s , new drugs were routinely receiving faster approval in Europe than in America . It was calculated in 1995 that reducing FDA review time by one year alone would cut annual industry costs by $361,000,000 . <p> By the early 1990s , total approval and development times ran 100% and 75% , respectively , higher in America than in other industrialized states . Of 150 new drugs and vaccines approved by the FDA between 1990 and 1994 , 61% were available first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind other industrialized states . <p> A number of strategies could speed drugs to market . Most fundamentally , FDA regulatory approval could be limited to safety , with effectiveness left up to the marketplace , which is where it belongs . Even better , the FDA could operate as a certifying agency , providing a special stamp of approval ( or withholding one ) for a drug 's effectiveness rather than posing legal barriers to its entry into competitive markets . Then patients , doctors , and hospitals could consider approval by the FDA and European and Japanese pharmaceutical regulators . Private organizations also could test drugs and publicize their findings , just as the independent safety certifications and standards-writing organization Underwriters Laboratories reviews most electrical equipment . <p> The Progress and Freedom Foundation proposes allowing private entities to become FDA-licensed " Drug Certifying Bodies " and " Device Certification Bodies " to oversee pharmaceutical and product development , though the underlying legal standards of efficacy and safety and FDA enforcement would remain unchanged . Unapproved drugs could be marketed as such , with doctors , pharmacists , hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The potential for product liability lawsuits and medical malpractice claims also would remain a potent constraint on pharmaceutical practice . <p> There are other means , too , to help reduce pharmaceutical prices . For instance , the FDA could lower costs by moving more drugs to over-the-counter ( OTC ) sale status . In 1972 , the agency loosened its approval process , allowing more than 600 drugs to become available without prescriptions . The FDA has considered shifting the allergy drugs Allegra , Claritin , and Zyrtec to OTC status . Thus far , only Claritin has made the shift . It may take the same stance toward antibiotics , contraceptives , and treatments for other chronic conditions , such as high blood pressure , high cholesterol , and osteoporosis . The Consumer Healthcare Products Association estimates that consumers could save nearly $13,000,000,000 annually ( although insurance plans rarely cover the cost ) . Moreover , people could buy those medicines without visiting a doctor to get a prescription . <p> Nor does government alone bear responsibility for making the system more cost-conscious . Splitting pills in half ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of the dosage ) is a common practice that has the potential of saving drug consumers hundreds of millions of dollars annually . Asking doctors to consider costs and prescribe alternatives also would significantly reduce the pharmaceutical bill for many Americans . Physicians and patients also should develop strategies to reduce wasted ( unused ) medicines , estimated to cost $1,000,000,000 a year . <p> Americans understandably are concerned about rising pharmaceutical costs . Those concerns may be even greater overseas : last year the French government announced that it planned to " continue and strengthen " its push for lower prices on some medicines in an attempt to save $500-$600,000,000 a year . Costs are not everything , though . <p> People continue to use drugs , even while complaining about the expense , because of their great benefits . Those benefits come only because profit-minded private firms are able to raise capital for R &D; investments in the risky and uncertain business of pharmaceutical production . Marcia Angell and Arnold Relman of the Harvard Medical School argue that drugs are necessary for people 's health and even their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though their only responsibility is to their shareholders . " Of course , such an argument could be made for any health care provider , as well as farmers and even producers of other necessities , such as clothes and houses . <p> Yet , without pharmaceutical industry shareholders , there would be no companies and no R &D.; Pharmaceutical firms are particularly important because they are entrepreneurial . Although profits are the driving economic force , that does n't mean that the people who staff pharmaceutical companies do n't desire to do good . <p> High costs pose a serious , but manageable , problem . Intrusive regulation and price controls would pose a far more serious , and far less manageable , situation . New drugs are saving countless lives today . New Federal and state controls , in contrast , would be hazardous to Americans ' health . Government policymakers must avoid taking steps that would , intentionally or not , wreck a world-leading industry and deny people access to life-saving medicines . <p> By Doug Bandow <p> <p> Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
