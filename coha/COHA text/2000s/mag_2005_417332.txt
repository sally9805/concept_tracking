Yogurt 's gift to healthy cooks : foods that taste rich , but are n't // If you could peek into refrigerators across America , there 's a good chance you 'd find a carton of yogurt in many of them .

Some believe the live cultures used to turn milk into yogurt provide potential health benefits such as bolstering the immune system , preventing gastrointestinal infections and easing arthritis . While these and other claims are still being researched , we do know that yogurt is a great source of calcium and protein , as well as phosphorus , vitamin Bsub 12 and magnesium .
