<p> Early next month , a villager in the mountainous jungles of northern Laos will climb onto a stationary bicycle hooked to a handmade , wireless computer and pedal his people into the digital age . <p> It will be the first time a human-powered computer has ever linked a Third World village to the Internet by wireless remote . And the two Americans who will make this possible  --  one a Navy veteran who became a leader in the Vietnam anti-war movement two generations ago , the other a founding pioneer of Silicon Valley  --  plan to be at his side as he pedals . <p> Long ago , when their hair was jet-black and the ' 60s were hot , these two graying Boomers  --  Lee Thorn of San Francisco and Lee Felsenstein of Palo Alto  --  were in the forefront of the raucous Berkeley left . Today , they still want to change the world . <p> But this time , it will be in the middle of a jungle 7,500 miles from home in a tiny village called Phon Kham  --  with a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth . <p> So why are they doing this ? <p> " It will be like Alexander Graham Bell , in the jungle , " Thorn said . " It 's groundbreaking and new . <p> " Right now , the villagers have no way of telling what the market is like in the big towns they sell their stuff to , telling what the weather report is for their crops , things like that . This will absolutely change that . Plus , they will be able to talk to relatives in America some of them have n't seen in decades . " <p> LOW-MAINTENANCE MACHINE <p> Technological projects have been slowly hooking remote villages in places such as India and Africa to the computer age for several years . But not in this way . They either involve cell phones , which need high-tech transmitter towers , or computers hooked into electricity and cable phone lines  --  not foot pedals and wireless antennas nailed to trees . <p> This new computer also has another element not common to Third World tech projects : The input of villagers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who are helping install it and who will be trained by Thorn 's group . Word has already spread so far and wide that 40 countries , including South Africa and Peru , are interested in it . <p> " This will change everyone 's lives in Phon Kham , " Vorasone Denkayaphichitch , who is coordinating the project in Laos and has relatives in the village area , said from Vientiane , the capital of Laos . " The important thing is for them to have communication , because every day they sell their ducks , rice , weaving and chickens , and every day they have to sell for less money than they should because they ca n't know what the real price is down in the towns . " <p> PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS <p> All 200 residents of Phon Kham live in bamboo houses with thatch roofs . There is no electricity . No telephone . If you want to go to the next tiny village a few miles away , you walk a dirt road that will probably wash out when the monsoons come . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation on earth  --  which during the Vietnam War had 2 million tons of bombs dropped on it by the United States , more than was dumped on Germany and Japan combined in World War II . <p> On its face , it could sound crazy to try to hook Laos up to a microchip world that its villagers would seem incapable of understanding , let alone using . <p> But nobody had counted on the 59-year-old Thorn . <p> During the Vietnam War , he was a Navy bomb loader on an aircraft carrier that was among those that launched devastating air strikes against Laos and Cambodia in the then-secret U.S. " shadow war . " Decades later , racked with a need for penance , Thorn created the Jhai Foundation , a nonprofit that works to rebuild rural Laos  --  and which will launch this new computer . <p> His partner in the computer venture has an equally dynamic background , albeit more pacific . Felsenstein , 57 , invented the Osborne 1 , the world 's first portable computer , and in the 1970s he kick-started the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , Apple creators Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs . <p> PEDAL POWER <p> His latest invention , created specially for Thorn 's group , is the bike-pedaled computer . <p> The two have assembled a team of a dozen wireless-technology and personal computer hotshots from the Bay Area and around the world , and they will tromp into the land mine- , snake-infested Laotian jungles over the next few weeks . There , with the help of the Phon Kham villagers , they will install the computer Felsenstein created out of off-the-shelf odds and bits  --  and on Feb. 12 , they intend to fire the machine up and hook into the Internet . <p> SOLUTION FOR VILLAGERS <p> They call the invention the Jhai Computer , Jhai meaning " hearts and minds working together " in Laotian . It was built because the villagers asked Thorn for a way , any way , they could better tap into their country 's economy and have contact with the outside world . <p> The bike-pedaled generator will power a battery that in turn runs the computer , which sits in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 486-type computer . Felsenstein designed it to run on only 12 watts  --  compared to a typical computer 's 90 watts  --  so the bike power would be up to the task . <p> " It has no moving parts , the lid seals up tight , and you can dunk it in water and it will still run , " Felsenstein said . " The idea is to be rugged , last at least 10 years and run in both the monsoon season and the dry season . " <p> ROOF-TO-TREE CONNECTIVITY <p> The computer will hook up with a wireless card  --  an 802.11b , the current industry standard  --  to an antenna bolted on the roof of a bamboo house , and the signal will be beamed from there to an antenna nailed to a tree on top of a mountain . There the signal will be bounced to Phon Hong , which sits 25 miles from Phon Kham and is the nearest big village with phone lines . The phone lines then hook to an Internet service provider . <p> Felsenstein crafted the Jhai to run on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , will not be obsolete in 18 months . Then he recruited a Laotian IBM engineer in New York to customize it to the Lao language . Mark Summer , a leader among San Francisco wireless aficionados , designed the connections and tested them last summer on the city 's hills . <p> Through the Internet connection , the Jhai Computer will be able to not only do e-mail , but also run a two-way telephone system through Voice Over Internet Protocol , or VOIP . <p> If the first Jhai Computer works as planned , Thorn 's group will hook up four nearby villages and start an institute to train the residents . Eventually , they may mass-produce it for other countries . <p> " I 've never heard of anything exactly like this being done , in this way , " said Dennis Allison , the noted Stanford University electrical engineering lecturer and co-founder of the groundbreaking People 's Computer Co. in the 1970s . After seeing a recent presentation by Felsenstein on the invention , he concluded : " From a social impact point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> HEALING MISSION <p> What impelled Thorn to recruit Felsenstein and the rest of his team is the same thing that motivated him to create the Jhai Foundation in 1998 . He wants to repair the damage wreaked by a war nobody acknowledged at the time  --  officially , the United States never laid a hand , let alone a bomb , on Laos  --  and in doing so repair some of the pain he feels at having been part of that war . <p> " This is all about Jhai , the hearts and minds together , about doing what is right , " Thorn said . " This is what the Phon Kham people asked for , and this is the most reasonable response to their request . It 's simple . " <p> It 's the same straightforward style he used three decades ago when he co-founded the national Veterans for Peace at UC Berkeley . And five years ago as well , when he loaded up a backpack of surplus medical supplies and flew to Laos with the simple aim of doing some good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back again and again out of gratitude , " Thorn said . " The last five years I 've been able to heal myself in ways I never thought would be possible , and that 's because of the relationships I 've built in Laos . " <p> Operating on a shoestring budget of donations from contacts Thorn made as a peace activist , Jhai has built wells , installed computer learning labs for children , helped clear unexploded bombs and started importing coffee to America . <p> The most powerful factor on Thorn 's side these days is the genius he knew from the old radical times and whom he recruited to get the computer project going  --  Felsenstein . <p> For Felsenstein , the idea of making a computer " for the people " has driven him since the 1960s , when he wrote for the Berkeley Barb and was tech whiz for the Free Speech Movement . The zeal never faded as Felsenstein 's career carried on through the years to his current job at a Mountain View medical instruments company . <p> " The human situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology we had available , " he said in his characteristic dead-pan , engineer 's earnestness . " What 's incredible is that we could n't just go to the store and buy this already , that it had to be invented . " <p> Neither of the two Lees , both not as svelte as they used to be , is looking forward to schlepping the computer and its clunky antennas through the jungle . But neither is complaining . <p> People scoffed at Thorn years ago when he wanted to band veterans together to make a peace movement , and they scoffed at Felsenstein when he said he could make a portable computer . And today , they are just as determined to beat the odds . <p> Some whom they have consulted for advice on where to buy batteries and the like have , just at the mention of the project , laughed skeptically . That just makes the two Lees smile . <p> " When someone says to me , ' I do n't understand what you 're doing , you must be crazy , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said.For information on donations to the Jhai Foundation 's work in Laos , go to **26;8405;TOOLONG / E-mail Kevin Fagan at kfagan@sfchronicle.com.
