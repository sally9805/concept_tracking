Section : LABOR LAW EEOC rules may make an ' employee ' out of a law firm partner , and open the door to discrimination suits <p> When is a law firm partner not a law firm partner ? It may be when he or she files a discrimination suit against the firm , according to guidelines posted last year by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . <p> Under the EEOC standards , most income partners and even some equity partners may be considered employees for enforcement purposes . And that could force many law firms to take another look at their employment policies , especially regarding mandatory retirement , the rule most commonly affecting those who have attained partner status . <p> Usually , mandatory retirement is legal because partners are n't protected by federal age discrimination law . But if a partner is termed an employee under agency standards , anti-discrimination statutes apply . And under federal law , with few exceptions , it 's illegal to require employees to retire at a specified age . Last year , the EEOC revised its standards for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an effort to make its compliance manual simpler and easier to understand . Agency officials say the new standards incorporate the EEOC 'S long-standing enforcement policy . <p> But , without a known enforcement action against another law firm to serve as a cautionary example , many firms have n't zeroed in on the issue . " I do n't think there 's a high degree of focus on this particular topic , " says Joseph B. Altonji , a director of Hildebrandt Intl. , a legal consulting firm . " In my experience , it has not risen to a level of high on the radar screens . " <p> So far , it appears the EEOC has not sued a law firm over a mandatory retirement rule for partners , or any other alleged violation of the federal anti-discrimination statutes . However , a test case charging a law firm with discriminatory treatment of partners may be just around the corner , some experts predict . <p> " I do n't know why we have n't seen more litigation , " says Robert W. Hillman , a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focuses on partnership law and legal ethics . <p> He believes it 's just a matter of time until the EEOC or a group of attorneys files a successful discrimination suit against a law firm over its treatment of so-called partners . And once that occurs , he says , such cases could become commonplace . Firm Size a Factor <p> Another development that may prompt more partner discrimination suits is the move toward bigger law firms . The EEOC 's standards for determining whether a partner is an employee focus on the degree to which he or she is involved in management . In contrast to small firms , where partners often share important administrative roles , it is n't feasible for every partner in a large firm to serve on key management committees . Hence , partners at large law firms may be more likely to be deemed employees . <p> Chicago employment lawyer Ellen E. McLaughlin doubts the agency will file a partner discrimination suit against a law firm anytime soon . More likely , she says , individual partners will complain to the EEOC about their law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative charges and , eventually , to the partners filing suit in federal court . <p> " I think you 're going to see more of those , " McLaughlin predicts . " Given the way law firms are changing , potentially you 're going to see more partners bringing suits against their law firms for discrimination . " <p> If a partner makes such a complaint , the EEOC will investigate , says Peggy R. Mastroianni , associate legal counsel for the EEOC in Washington , D.C. The investigation " would depend very much on the specifics " of the relationship between the firm and its so-called partners , she says . " And the kind of thing you would look at is how the money that they take home is determined , and , if they are evaluated , how . " <p> The revised guidelines urge EEOC investigators not to rule out employee status simply because a lawyer , accountant or other sional is called a partner . Ins the guidelines say , " The investigator should determine whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization 's control . " If it 's the latter , then the individual is considered an employee . <p> Among the factors to be considered in making this determination : whether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual 's work ; whether and to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization ; whether the parties intended that the individual be an employee , as expressed in written agreements or contracts ; and whether the individual shares in the profits , losses and liabilities of the organization . <p> No specific instructions are given concerning the relative weight of each factor . Nor do all or even a majority of the criteria need to be met , the manual states . <p> McLaughlin says she fears that investigators unfamiliar with how a law firm operates could apply the test too broadly . " Especially in a larger firm , where an equity partner has a voting right and has the ability to be on committees that direct the organization , many partners are n't on those committees but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Mastroianni , though , says the critical issue is self-direction . " The big factor is control , " she says . " Do you have control over what you do ? Can someone else fire you ? We look at things like that to determine whether someone is in fact an employee even though he or she is called a partner . " <p> In several partner discrimination cases brought against large accounting firms , for instance , " You had people who were called partners , but basically ... they really had no control over their destiny , " she says . " That was the characteristic quality in those kinds of cases . " Lack of Law Firm Data <p> Because the EEOC does n't compile statistics about the types of employers it sues , it is n't known how many discrimination cases involve law firms . None of the persons interviewed for this article recalled hearing of any commission suits against law firms alleging discriminatory treatment of partners . Since administrative charges and their resolutions are confidential , EEOC officials would not discuss them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners against their law firms have largely been unsuccessful . Nonetheless , a steady trickle of such cases in recent years could eventually become a stream to the courthouse . In one recent case , a female attorney who sued her law firm for sex discrimination was found to be a partner , not an employee , and hence could not continue her case . Serapion v. Martinez , 119 F.3d 982 ( 1st Cir. 1997 ) . <p> The appeals panel said the plaintiffs ownership interest , remuneration and management duties showed that she was a partner . <p> However , the appellate court left the door open to other such suits , characterizing as a gray area whether " Title VII 's employment-related shelter might in certain circumstances extend to a person who is a partner in a law firm . " <p> Courts have also been willing , at least in initial proceedings , to define partners as employees in other discrimination cases . <p> For instance , in Siko v. Kassab , Archbold &; O'Brien , L.L.P. , 77 Fair Employ . Prac . Cas. 1032 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were counted as employees to establish the threshold number of total employees required to allow a plaintiffs attorney to proceed with a pregnancy discrimination claim against her law firm . <p> Meanwhile , by opting to become corporations rather than partnerships , law firms may find they 've given up the " not an employee " defense entirely . That happened to an insurance firm . <p> In EEOC v. Johnson &; Higgins , 91 F.3d 1529 ( 2nd Cir. 1996 ) , a large insurance brokerage and consulting firm argued that members of its board of directors were de facto partners for the purpose of an age discrimination claim . But the appellate court said the firm could not win this argument because it had chosen to be a corporation . Hence , its mandatory retirement policy violated the law . The case settled in 1999 for $28 million . <p> Johnson &; Higgins got started when an employee of the company filed an unrelated administrative discrimination claim , says James Lee , the lead EEOC prosecutor on the case , who now works out of the agency 's Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson &; Higgins regarding his termination , and sort of said , ' Oh , by the way , they have this mandatory retirement program there , ' " Lee recounts . " That 's what prompted us to look into it . " <p> That case involved an insurance company , though law firms should n't think they will remain out of the EEOC 's reach . If a firm 's policies might not be fully in accord with how a partner is legally defined , this may be a good time to look into the issue , says McLaughlin . <p> " Law firms need to be aware , " she says . " It 's not enough to say , ' Joe 's a partner and therefore he can not bring a claim tinder the discrimination laws . ' " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ELLEN E.
