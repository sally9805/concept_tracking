<p> Almost everyone thinks they 're a good idea . But few have made them a habit . Like eating your spinach , family meetings are widely considered beneficial , but sometimes difficult to swallow . Champions of the family , such as Stephen Covey , author of the best-selling " The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families , " insist , however , that this ritual , when done right , can provide structure amid chaos ; a forum for speaking up , being heard , and listening to others ; and perhaps , most important , a time to bond . " In the old days when dad was home at 6 , these meetings were called dinner , " says Paul Coleman , author of " How to Say It to Your Kids : The Right Words to Solve Problems , Soothe Feelings , and Teach Values . " While sharing a meal , families might plan vacations , exchange news of the day , and vent frustrations about issues such as chores or allowances . But nowadays , when family suppers are often sandwiched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kids ' basketball games or hockey practices , the need to schedule time is greater than ever , says Mr. Coleman . In his household , Sunday supper is the time when Coleman , his wife , and three children - ages 10 , 12 , and 15 - take extra time to touch base about the week ahead , make special plans , or just chat about what 's on their minds . " As long as there 's some sacred family time during the week , " he says , " no phone calls , no background music , and a time when all can speak freely without judgment , it does n't really matter when that happens . " The bottom line is that families keep talking , he adds , citing a recent University of Michigan study that found household conversation had dropped nearly 100 percent between 1981 and 1997 . It 's often the " meeting " label that turns people off . For some , it rings of corporate conference rooms , preprinted agendas , and pontificating facilitators - just what they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens , might respond to the " M " word with " Oh , no , what are they going to lay on me now ? " says David McNamara , a family counselor in Boulder , Colo. , who is working on a book about strategies for building family unity . It 's OK to keep a businesslike format with an agenda , a leader , and a note-taker , but the idea might go down less like spinach and more like hot apple pie , says Mr. McNamara , if there 's also an element of fun . Sunday nights are also the time when the McNamara family drops everything to be together . For the past six years , David , his wife , Alexandra , and their two children have shared an evening of pasta and " Star Trek . " No scheduling conflicts are allowed , and everyone takes a turn at the stove . " It has nothing to do with pasta and " Star Trek , " and everything to do with what we value as a family - just hanging out and spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , it 's now Geoffrey McNamara , a college freshman , and his sister , Erin , a 10th-grader , who insist this date ca n't be broken . " It seems like a silly ritual , " says Geoffrey , " but it has bonded us in other ways . We all have an amazing connection . " Of course , it 's taken more than a bowl of noodles and Dr. Spock to keep the McNamaras talking . Sometimes they do n't get into anything meaty on those Sunday nights . But over the years , the parents have made a conscious effort to " create a climate of openness " not just on Sundays but every day . In his practice , McNamara urges clients to also start some sort of family ritual at home that will inspire an open dialogue . " Meetings really do work , " he says . " We just were n't organized enough . And it 's best to start them when the kids are young . That 's when they get really excited about the idea . " Some families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or , in the case of the Darata family , a " family home evening . " When asked about families who are successfully holding regular meetings , parenting workshop leader Jody Johnston Pawel instantly thought of the Daratas . They have taken her workshop , during which she praises the meeting concept , but their church - the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - had also familiarized them with it . Although the Mormon church helps its members get started with this tradition and incorporate religious teachings , some non-Mormons look to this church 's example as a model . Reached at their home outside Atlanta , Carrie Darata , explained that every Monday night she , her husband , and their five children , ranging in age from 13 to 3 , gather for Bible readings and a discussion of schedules and other issues , followed by a game and a snack . And during this holiday month , they are meeting nightly to read a Christmas story . This idea was second nature to Mrs. Darata , who grew up with family home evenings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening lasts only about 20 minutes , but during that time , they pack a lot in . " We plan events , talk about our schedules , vacations , and any issues such as chores that one child might consider unfair , " she explains . " We 're also working on a family mission statement , a slogan , and a list of our favorite books . " After taking care of business , it 's time to just relax together . Darata and others interviewed for this article agree that meetings should be called every week without fail , and definitely not just when a problem arises . This is a sure way to give them a bad name . And so far , in the Darata household , they are a highly anticipated event . In an e-mail dictated to dad , the children commented effusively on these gatherings , citing songs , games , snacks , and even goal-setting as highlights . The eldest , Sarah , recalls when her parents announced that they were going to have a new baby sister , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monopoly . Her father , Paul , says such an upbeat attitude is shared partly because of the democratic tone set at these meetings . " Everyone has a chance to contribute , " he insists . To which mom Carrie adds that even three-year-old Claire takes the floor now and then . A tone of inclusiveness is key to the success of any family meeting , say parenting pros . This can be especially effective with teenagers , says Dr. Ben Allen , who counsels children and families in Northbrook , Ill . " If they feel heard and understood , they will let their guard down , " he explains . It 's also important , he adds , to make the meeting optional , not mandatory , but also to make clear that by coming , each person gets to share an opinion , help bring closure and clarity to things that are getting out of hand , and navigate the fun stuff . " By letting everyone have a voice and a role in brainstorming ideas for major decisions , parents need to also make clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the final say . Like Carrie Darata , Mr. Allen also grew up with this tradition , which his family playfully called " Brady Bunch meetings . " He recalls them fondly . " I was a teen rebel , " he says , " but I felt like I was important at these meetings . I always went . It was fun . " Allen laments that not enough families get together this way anymore . " I hear from people all the time who would love to start this ritual , but schedules are so intense that no one even has time to breathe , " he says . All the more reason , says McNamara , that these get-togethers need to be anything but heavy . No one needs more intensity in their day . " If I get at all heavy , " he says with a laugh , " my kids jump all over me . What 's most important is to just have fun together , and that will help create an atmosphere where kids will want to talk about all kinds of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Science Publishing Society
