Metallica 's new album is a brutally therapeutic assault . It just might cure what ails you . St. Anger Metal ( Elektra ) " Do n't worry about getting in touch with your anger-it 'll get in touch with you " is a bit of advice that recovering addicts who 've been drug-free for a while have been known to offer clean-and-sober neophytes . The truth of that maxim can be heard on Metallica 's just-released CD , St. Anger , a roiling , assaultive 75-minute opus that was recorded in the wake of singer-guitarist James Hetfield 's recent , much-publicized stint in rehab . Apparently , Hetfield is on very intimate terms with his anger , and the rest of the band is more than willing to help him wrestle with it . Not that Metallica ever had a problem expressing hostility or negative feelings-hell , they even called their 1983 debut Kill " Em All . But St. Anger is practically a concept disc about rage , a brutal extended meditation on the state of being perpetually hot under the collar . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for me , " wails Hetfield on the title track , as protective of this loaded emotion as a new father of his infant child . Musically , Metallica have stripped things down to pure grit and viscera , hammering their riffs home with single-minded , grim determination . The back-to-basics approach will no doubt please longtime fans who look back fondly at the band 's bludgeoning ' ' 80s work and viewed , as we did , their move to a poppier melodiousness in the ' ' 90s with suspicion ( after all , they scored a hit with a Bob Seger cover ) . Paradoxically , St. Anger sounds both supertight and wildly expansive : While 3 of these 11 songs clock in at over 8 minutes ( and the shortest of the others is 5:25 ) , there are no solos to be heard-just a relentless barrage of guitars , drums , and raw-throated howls . If you 're in search of a power ballad , you 're out of luck : " Sweet Amber " is the closest thing to a genuine slow burner , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band veers headlong into its trademark dinosaur-in-heat stomp . Likewise , " All Within My Hands " at first seems like it might be a cover of a forgotten Flock of Seagulls number ( really ! ) before turning on a dime into another pounding , punishing epic of angst . Metallica have often been accused of humorlessness , but odd bits of tongue-in-cheek fun shine through . On the ferocious " My World , " Hetfield boasts , " It 's my world , you ca n't have it , " and you can almost hear the subliminal nyah-nyah-nyah in his delivery . On " Shoot Me Again , " he sounds positively gleeful as he taunts an opponent : " Shoot me again , I ai n't dead yet . " No doubt more than a few Metallica fans have gone the rehab route . One gets the feeling that St. Anger may have a special meaning for them , especially when viewed against the backdrop of Hetfield 's newfound sobriety . Indeed , the disc might well end up serving as a sort of aural totem for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathstyle , " runs a lyric from " Frantik , " as pithy an anti-drug slogan as we 've heard ) . Of course , metal has long been therapeutic in nature , functioning as a sort of primal-scream therapy for disaffected kids . But you certainly do n't need to be in recovery to benefit from an occasional session with a loud , hard-rock album . St. Anger is arguably the season 's finest metal offering-and the band 's best since 1991 's Metallica . And , at about $18 retail , it 's way cheaper than a session with a headshrinker .
