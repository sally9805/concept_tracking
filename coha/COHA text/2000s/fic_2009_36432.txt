Rome brawled around Publius Quinctilius Varus . Half a dozen stalwart lectiarii bore his sedan chair through the streets towards Augustus ' house on the Palatine hill . The slaves wore matching red tunics . Their smooth , skillful broken step kept him from feeling the bumps in the cobblestoned roadway . <p> Varus could have lowered the sedan chair 's curtains . That would have given him privacy in the midst of untold tens of thousands . But he did n't mind being seen , not today . Anyone could tell at a glance that he was someone important . <p> A wagon full of sacks of grain drawn by two plodding oxen blocked his path . The ungreased axles squealed and groaned . A man could die of old age stuck behind something like that . <p> His slaves were n't about to put up with it . One of the pedisequi who accompanied the litter  --  a Roman aristocrat was too special to carry what ever he might need , but had underlings to do it for him  --  called out in Greek-accented Latin : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter of Publius Quinctilius Varus ! " <p> In narrow , winding streets packed with people on foot , donkeys , carts , and other wagons , making way for anybody was n't easy . The gray-haired man driving the wagon did n't even try . " To the crows with him , whoever he is , " he shouted back . His accent said he was a Samnite or Oscan by birth . <p> " ' Whoever he is ' ? How dare you , you  --  peasant , you ! " The pedisequus knew no worse abuse . He was as furious as if he 'd been insulted himself . The master was the sun ; the slave was the moon , and shone by his reflected light . Varus ' man went on , " I will have you know he was consul twenty years ago . Consul , I tell you ! He is just returned to Rome after governing the province of Syria . And he is married to Augustus ' grand-niece . Gods help you , wretch , if he has to ask your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also flicked the lash at a couple of middle-aged women to make them get out of the way . They screeched abuse at him , but they moved . The wagon slid into the space they 'd occupied . The litter and its retinue glided past . <p> " Nicely done , Aristocles , " Varus said . The pedisequus thrust out his chin and thrust out his chest and marched along as if he were ten cubits tall and eight cubits wide , not a balding , weedy little Greek . Quinctilius Varus smiled to himself . As with anything else , there were tricks to getting the most out of your slaves . Judicious praise at the right moment could do more good than a denarius . <p> Aristocles did more shouting as the litter made its way toward the Palatine . Too many people and not enough room for all of them  --  that was Rome . Musicians strummed citharae or played flutes , hoping passersby would throw them enough coins to keep them fed . Scribes stood at street-corners , ready to write for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figs candied in honey ! " " Beads ! Fine glass beads from Egypt ! " " Bread and cheese and oil ! " " Kohl to make your eyes pretty ! " " Roasted songbirds ! Who wants roasted songbirds ? " " Amulets will give you luck ! " " Wine ! Genuine Falernian ! " <p> Varus guffawed . So did his bearers . The pedisequi , men who made much of their dignity , only shook their heads . No one but a fool would think a scrawny street merchant lugging an amphora had wine . t for Augustus himself . What ever was in that jug would taste like vinegar  --  if it did n't taste like piss . <p> When the litter finally reached the Palatine hill , traffic thinned out . This had been a prosperous part of town for many years . Important people  --  proper Romans  --  lived here . You did n't see so many trousered Gauls and swarthy Jews and excitable Numidians on the Palatine . People from all over the Empire swarmed to Rome , hoping to strike it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them out . Too bad , Varus thought . <p> And the Palatine became all the more exclusive when Augustus , master of the Roman world , took up residence on the hillside . He had dominated the Empire for more than a third of a century now . Senators still pined for the days of the Republic , when they were the biggest fish in the pond . Most people did n't remember those days any more . Most of the ones who did , remembered round after round of civil war . Hardly anyone  --  except those Senators  --  would have traded Augustus ' peace and prosperity for the chaos it replaced . <p> Quinctilius Varus knew he would n't . He was part of the new order : one of the many who 'd risen high by going along with the man who had  --  who 'd won  --  the power to bind and to loose . He could n't have done better under the Republic . Rome could n't have done better under the Republic , but Rome mattered less to Varus than Varus did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently . He 'd killed himself at Philippi along with Brutus and Cassius after they lost against Antony and Octavian  --  who was not yet calling himself Augustus . Almost fifty years ago now ; Publius had been a boy . He was lucky the victors had n't proscribed the losers ' families . He nodded solemnly . He was lucky a lot of ways . <p> Soldiers guarded Augustus ' residence . Augustus was no fool  --  he was about as far from a fool as a man could be . He knew some people still resented his mastery of Rome . Three cohorts of praetorian troops  --  about 1,500 men  --  were stationed in the city to protect him . Six more cohorts were based in nearby towns . The armored men in front of the doorway unmistakably separated his house from all the others on the Palatine . <p> Some of the guards were Italians . Others , tall and fair , had to be Gauls or Germans . In its way , it was a sensible arrangement . Rome as Rome meant nothing to the barbarians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Who are you ? What do you want here ? " the biggest and blondest of them asked , his accent guttural , as Varus ' litter came up . <p> Aristocles answered for Varus : " My master is Publius Quinctilius Varus , the ex-consul . He is to meet with Augustus this afternoon . " He did n't throw his master 's rank in the German 's face , as he had with the wagon driver . The praetorian , after all , served a man with a higher rank yet  --  with the highest rank . But even someone summoned to meet with Augustus was a man of some consequence . . . and his pedisequus , therefore , a slave of some consequence . <p> " You wait here . We check , " the guard said . He spoke in his own sonorous tongue . One of the other soldiers ducked inside . <p> " It will be all right , boys , " Varus told the lectiarii . " You can put me down now . " <p> Gently , the bearers lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched . Unlike his slaves , he wore a toga , not a tunic . He rearranged the drape of the garment . At the same time , not quite accidentally , he flashed the purple stripe that marked his status . <p> The soldier returned and said something in the Germans ' language to the man in charge of the detachment . That worthy inclined his head to Varus . " You may go in now , sir , " he said , respect ousting practiced suspicion from his voice . <p> " Good . " Varus left it at that . He never knew how to talk to Augustus ' guards . They were n't equals ; by the nature of things , they could n't be equals . But they were n't insignificant people , either . A puzzlement . <p> As soon as he and his two pedisequi went inside , one of Augustus ' civilian slaves took charge of them . Varus was sure someone else would bring his bearers into the shade and give them something cool to drink . A great house  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things as a matter of course . <p> " I hope you are well , sir , " Augustus ' slave said politely . <p> " Yes , thank you . " Varus enquired not about the slave 's health but about his master 's : " I hope Augustus is , too . " <p> With a hint of a smile , the slave answered , " He says a man who gets as old as he is is either well or dead . " <p> That held considerable truth , and truth told with Augustus ' usual pith . The ruler of the Roman world was seventy , an age many aspired to and few reached . He 'd had several serious illnesses in his earlier days , but recovered from them all . And he 'd outlived the younger men he 'd expected to succeed him . <p> Varus , in his early fifties , already felt the first hints that the proud strength of his youth would not last forever  --  and might not last much longer . And he 'd enjoyed good health most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth that finally needed the dentist 's forceps . He shuddered and tried to forget those times . <p> The slave led him and his attendants to a small room on the north side of a courtyard . A roofed colonnade shielded it from direct sun , but the broad doorway still let in plenty of light . The slave darted in ahead of Varus . His voice floated out through the doorway : " Sir , Quinctilius Varus is here to see you . " <p> " Well , bring him in . " Augustus ' voice was mushy ; over the years , he 'd had more trouble with his teeth than Varus had . <p> At the slave 's gesture , Varus and his pedisequi walked into the room where Augustus waited . Despite his years , the ruler of the Roman world moved very gracefully . He stood so straight , he seemed uncommonly tall , although he was n't . He wore a toga of solid purple : a luxury he 'd reserved for himself alone . <p> " Good day , sir , " Varus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost double . As he straightened , he went on , " How may I serve you today ? " <p> " We 'll get there , do n't worry . " Augustus turned and waved towards a chair . " In the meantime , sit down . Make yourself at home . " Seen full on , his broad face seemed mild and unassuming . In profile , though , the harsh curve of his nose warned there was more to him than first met the eye . <p> " Thank you , sir , " Varus said . The pedisequi stood on either side of his chair . <p> Augustus eased himself down into a larger chair with a cushion on the seat . One of his slaves brought in refreshments : green figs , sardines , and watered wine . He 'd always had simple taste in food . <p> As he and Varus nibbled , he asked , " How is Claudia ? " <p> " She 's fine , sir , " Varus answered . " She sends her great-uncle her love . " If his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had anyhow . <p> " That 's good . " Augustus smiled , showing off his bad teeth . A lock of hair  --  almost entirely white now  --  flopped down over his right eye . Varus , whose hairline had retreated farther than Aristocles ' , was jealous of Augustus ' . Smiling still , the older man went on , " She 's a pretty girl . " <p> " She is , yes . " Varus could say that in all sincerity . His wife was called Claudia Pulchra  --  Claudia the Good-looking . It made what had been a marriage of convenience more enjoyable . <p> " How 's your son ? " Augustus asked . <p> " He 's studying in Athens right now . " Varus smiled , too . " Whenever he writes , he wants money . " <p> " What else do children want from their father ? " Augustus said with a wry chuckle . " Still , we have to civilize them if we can . " He spoke the last sentence in fluent Greek . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . Dropping back into Latin , he continued , " I could n't have managed anything in Syria if I did n't know Greek . Only our soldiers there know any Latin  --  and some of them do better in Greek , too . " <p> Augustus sipped from his wine . It was watered more than Varus enjoyed ; Augustus had always been a temperate man . " You did well in Syria , " he said as he set down the cup . <p> " Thank you very much , sir . It 's a rich province . " Varus had been staggered to discover how rich Syria was . Places like that showed him Italy was only a new land . Rome claimed to have been founded 760 years earlier , but it had been a prominant place for only three centuries . Some of the Syrian towns went back thousands of years  --  long before the Trojan War . And the wealth they held ! Varus went into Syria poor and came out prosperous without being especially corrupt . <p> " You did so well there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , " Augustus said . <p> " Sir ? " Varus leaned forward . He had all he could do not to show too much of his excitement . After you 'd been governor of Syria , where could you go ? Achaea ? It was n't so rich as Syria , but it held more cachet than any other province . It was under senatorial administration , not formally Augustus ' to control , but if he asked the Conscript Fathers to honor his kinsman by marriage , how could they say no ? <p> Or maybe Egypt ! Egypt belonged to Augustus  --  he would n't dream of letting the Senators get their hands on the place . Egypt made Syria seem poor by comparison . If you served as Augustal prefect in Egypt , you were set for life , and so were all your heirs . <p> " Yes . " The ruler of the Roman world leaned forward , too . " Germany , " he said . <p> " Germany ? " Varus hoped his disappointment did n't show . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man could enjoy himself , could live . " It 's a long way from . . . well , everywhere , sir . " That was as much of a protest as Varus would allow himself . <p> " I know it is . And I know it will be a bit of a shock after Syria . " No , Augustus was nobody 's fool . When he was very young , Antony made the fatal mistake of underestimating him . Everyone who made that mistake was sorry afterwards , but afterwards was commonly too late . Of course Augustus would have a good idea of what Varus was thinking right now . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I am sorry , but I need someone I can trust there . It just has n't shaped up the way I wish it would have . " <p> " I 'll do my best , sir , if that 's what you want , " Varus said . Gods ! How will I tell Claudia ? he wondered . The . t she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also made him give evasion another try : " Should n't you perhaps think of someone with , ah , more military experience ? " <p> " I 'd send Tiberius , but he 's busy putting down the uprising in Pannonia , " Augustus replied . " He 's finally getting somewhere , too . Why the Pannonians could n't see they 'd be better off under Roman rule . . . But they could n't , and so he has to show them . " <p> " I 'm glad to hear he 's doing well , " Varus said . He wished Tiberius were doing better still , so he could deal with the Germans . Plainly , though , that would n't happen . Which meant Varus was stuck with it . Which meant he had to make the best of it . If there was any best to be made . <p> " When my father conquered Gaul , he did it in one campaign , and the conquest stuck , " Augustus said fretfully . He was Julius Caesar 's sister 's grandson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'd taken advantage of that for more than half a century now . The comparison still had to weigh on him , though , for he went on , " I 've been sending armies into Germany the past twenty years . They mostly win when they fight the Germans , but the country is n't subdued yet . And it needs to be . A frontier that runs from the Elbe to the Danube is much shorter and easier to garrison and cheaper to maintain than the one we 've got now , on the Rhine and the Danube . I could hold it with far fewer soldiers . " <p> " Yes , sir . " Varus suspected Augustus had got to the root of things right there . Augustus had been cutting the army down to size ever since winning supreme power . Paying soldiers was the most expensive thing the Roman government did . A shorter frontier would mean he did n't have to pay so many of them . <p> " Besides , " Augustus added , " the Germans are a pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaul . They helped stir up the Pannonian rebels  --  they 've given them aid and comfort , too . I want them suppressed . It 's about time . We 've played games with them for too cursed long . " <p> A cold wind seemed to blow through the little room . You 'll answer for it if you do n't suppress them . Augustus did n't say that , but Varus knew he meant it . The ruler of the Roman world rewarded success . He punished failure , failure of every kind . His own daughter Julia had languished on a hot , miserable island for years because of infidelity and vice . No , he did n't fancy people who could n't live up to what he expected of them . <p> Licking his lips , Varus asked , " What kind of force will I have to bring the Germans into line ? " <p> " Three legions , " Augustus answered . " The XVII , the XVIII , and the XIX . They 're all solid outfits . I 'd give you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . But three should be plenty for the job . We have made progress in Germany . We just have n't made enough . " <p> " Three legions ! " Varus echoed . After Augustus ' cuts , there were only thirty all through the Empire . Excitement coursed through the younger man . He would command close to twenty thousand elite soldiers . Once he pacified Germany , people might not think of him in the same breath as Julius Caesar , but they would remember him . They 'd remember him for-ever . He inclined his head to his wife 's great-uncle . " I wo n't let you down , sir . " <p> " I would n't give you the men if I thought you would , " Augustus said . <p> Arminius led half a cohort of German auxiliaries down a trail in western Pannonia . A town called Poetovio lay not far away . The Roman legion to which his Germans were attached had retaken it from the Pannonian rebels a few days before . Deserters from the enemy said the Pannonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood . <p> " Keep your eyes open ! " Arminius called in his own guttural language . " We do n't want these barbarians giving us a nasty surprise . " <p> Some of the Germans chuckled . As far as the Romans were concerned , they were even more barbarous than the Pannonians . But they 'd taken ser vice with Rome . Why not ? Augustus was a good paymaster . The Pannonian rebels were n't , which meant that few Germans had gone over to them . <p> One of the soldiers said , " Nothing to fear in open woods like these . The rebels could n't set up a proper ambush even if they wanted to . " <p> " Keep your eyes open anyway , " Arminius answered . The other German nodded , but it was the kind of nod a man gave a chief he was humoring . Arminius recognized it ; he 'd used that kind of nod often enough himself . <p> And the other warrior had reason enough to use it here . By German standards , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also well to the east of the lands of the Cherusci , Arminius ' tribe . It was warmer , drier country than he was used to . Woods here were full of oak and ash and other broad-leafed trees . They were nothing like the dark forests of Germany , with pines and spruces growing close together , with a formidable understory of bushes and ferns , and marshes and swamps and bogs ready to swallow up a traveler unwary enough to wander off the track . <p> Rome had pushed her border up to the Danube in these parts only a generation earlier : not long after the legions reached the Rhine . Tidy , thrifty Augustus wanted to push east to the Elbe , which would shorten the frontier by hundreds of miles and let him use fewer legions to garrison it . The Pannonians had n't much minded at first , not till they saw that permanent occupation went hand in hand with higher taxes than they 'd ever known  --  till they discovered they were enslaved , in other words . Then they rose under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd put up a good fight , but the Romans were wearing them down at last . <p> Augustus aimed to enslave Germany , too . The German tribes had n't yielded as much as the Pannonians had before they rebelled . They loved their freedom , Germans did . Even so , quite a few of them would have welcomed slavery if it came with wine and silver drinking cups and gold coins to make them feel important . <p> And , obviously , quite a few of them took ser vice in the Roman auxiliaries . Some sought adventure . Some wanted to bring silver back to Germany when they went home . And some did n't aim to go home , but to win Roman citizenship after twenty years of ser vice and to settle inside the Empire . <p> Most of the Germans with Arminius were dressed Roman-style . He was himself : he wore hobnailed caligae on his feet ; a jingling mailshirt covered by a knee-length wool cloak ; and an iron helmet whose crest , which ran from ear to ear rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which he was , and a chief 's son to boot . The troopers he commanded had on cheap bronze versions of the standard legionary helmet . They carried oval shields like his , which covered less of them than the ones the Romans used themselves . <p> Their weapons , though , were the ones they 'd brought from Germany . They all carried spears , longer and stouter than the javelins Roman soldiers used . German spears were good for thrusting as well as throwing . And German swords , made for slashing , were half again as long as the stubby thrusting-swords the legionaries preferred . Since Germans ran at least a palm 's breadth taller than Romans and had correspondingly longer arms , they had more reach with their blades than legionaries did . <p> But Roman soldiers could do wicked work with those gladii of theirs . Arminius had seen as much in this campaign against the Pannonian rebels , and before that in clashes with the Romans inside Germany . His own folk , who fought to show off each warrior 's individual bravery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . They were no cowards , though . Arminius had also seen that for himself . <p> And , because they worked so well together , the Romans could do things in war that his own folk could not . Germans who had n't come into the Empire had no idea how vast it was or how smoothly it ran . Arminius had signed up as an auxiliary to learn the Romans ' tricks of the trade , so to speak , and bring what he could back to Germany . He 'd got more of a military education than he 'd dreamt of before he left the forests of his homeland , too . <p> The Pannonians had also learned the Roman style of fighting  --  they 'd made a point of it , in fact . When Arminius and his followers came out of the woods and looked across the rolling meadow beyond , he saw a few scrawny sheep grazing on the lush summer grass and , beyond them , a knot of eighty or a hundred men in chainmail and cloaks and helmets . He peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Pannonians and enemies ? It was n't easy to tell at first glance . <p> They seemed in no doubt about his men . They started away from the Germans as fast as they could go . In their commander 's caligae , Arminius would have done the same thing : his force outnumbered theirs by about two to one . <p> " After them , boys ! " he yelled . " Good fighting , good looting ! " The auxiliaries raised a cheer and swarmed across the broad meadow after the Pannonians . <p> And then , about a quarter of a mile to the south , a force of legionaries about the size of his also emerged from the woods . They were the outliers of the legion to which Arminius ' auxiliaries were attached . As soon as the Roman soldiers spotted the Pannonians , they also cheered and began to pursue . One of their officers waved to the Germans , as if to make sure his force and theirs were on the same side . <p> Arminius waved back , not without resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the hapless Pannonians . But the Germans would have to share what ever loot there was with the Romans , and who 'd ever heard of a Roman who was n't greedy ? <p> An average Pannonian was as quick on his feet as an average German or Roman ( even though the Romans had short legs , they were formidable marchers ) . But that was n't what a pursuit was about . If the Pannonians wanted to stick together and not get cut down one at a time , they had to move at the pace of their slowest men . The Romans and Germans on their trail steadily chewed up the ground between the forces . <p> One of the Pannonians shouted something . Arminius heard the words clearly , but could n't understand them . That proved the enemy was the enemy . Like most of the auxiliaries with him , Arminius had grown fluent in Latin . He still sometimes muttered to himself , going through a declension or conjugation , but he made himself understood  --  and he followed what Romans said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only gibberish to him  --  and to the Romans as well . <p> The rebels stopped retreating and formed a battle line . Long odds against them : longer , Arminius thought , than those against throwing a triple six in a dice game . But sometimes long odds were better than sure ruin , and sure ruin faced the Pannonians if they kept trying to run away . Maybe a fierce charge would make their pursuers think twice . <p> Maybe . But Arminius did n't believe it , not for a moment . " Be ready ! " he called to his fellow Germans . " They 're going to try to bull through us . " <p> " Let them try , " one of the big , fair men said . Several others nodded . Arminius smiled . No , his folk had never been one to back away from a fight . <p> That officer shouted something . Sure as demons , the Pannonians charged Arminius ' band , not the legionaries . The Germans ' looks , bronze helmets , and smaller shields all declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that made them the easier target . Well , he could think what ever he pleased . Thinking it did n't make it so . <p> " Sedatus ! " the Pannonians yelled , and , " Succellus ! " One of those was their . re god ; the other was a smith , who carried a hammer . They were using sharper tools now . <p> They showed almost Roman discipline as they bore down on the Germans . His own men fought with better discipline than they would have back in their native forests . Past that , Arminius indulged in no comparisons . With numbers on their side , and with the legionaries swinging up to help them , it should n't matter much . <p> Of course , even if the Germans and Romans would win in the end , a man still might get killed in the middle of the fight . The Pannonians loosed a volley of javelins at Arminius ' auxiliaries . A German screamed when one of the light spears pierced his right arm . Another javelin thudded into Arminius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of using a long shank of soft iron on their javelins . The shank bent when the javelin went home . Arminius could n't throw it back , and yanking it out of the shield would take time he did n't have . He threw the fouled shield aside . Fighting without one would have bothered a Roman . It left Arminius more vulnerable , but it did n't bother him a bit  --  he was used to going into battle with no more than spear and sword . <p> He jabbed at the man in front of him . The Pannonian used his big , heavy legionary-style shield well , holding it between Arminius ' spear and his vitals . His stabbing sword flicked out like a viper 's tongue . But he could n't reach Arminius with it , not when the German 's spear made him keep his distance . <p> They might have danced like that for some little while , each trying to figure out how to spill the other 's blood . They were n't alone on the battlefield , though . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's helmet . Without the ironworks on his head , it would have smashed in his skull . As things were , he staggered and lurched like a man who 'd just taken a fist to the chin . He dropped his guard , too . Arminius sprang forward and jabbed his spear into the fellow 's thigh , just below his iron-studded leather kilt . <p> The Pannonian howled in pain . He crumpled like a discarded sheet of papyrus  --  a comparison that never would have occurred to Arminius before joining the auxiliaries . The German chief stabbed again , aiming to finish him . But , even wounded , the Pannonian was wily : He used his shield like a turtle 's shell , covering himself with it as best he could . Arminius went on to fight another man . The wounded Pannonian could n't get away . Once the fight was over , somebody would cut his throat or smash in his head . All the wiliness in the world would n't save him then . <p> Even among Germans , Arminius was a big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger , and much thicker through the shoulders . The fellow screamed something at him . Since it was in the Pannonian language , Arminius understood not a word of it . Seeing as much , the warrior shouted again , this time in Latin : " Futter your mother ! " <p> " Your mother was a dog , and your father shat in her twat , " Arminius retorted . Latin was n't his language , either , which had n't kept him from learning to swear in it . <p> Roaring with rage , the big , burly Pannonian rushed at him . He aimed to knock Arminius down with his heavy shield and then stab him  --  or , if he was furious enough , kick him to death . What he aimed for was n't what he got . Arminius sidestepped like a dancer and then used a flick of his spearpoint to tear out the Pannonian 's throat . It was as pretty and precise a stroke as he 'd ever made . He was proud of it for days afterwards . <p> Blood fountained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , trying to stem the tide of gore . It was no use  --  Arminius knew a killing stroke when he gave one . The big man 's knees went limp as overcooked cabbage . He fell , and his armor clattered about him . <p> Romans liked to say things like that . It was a line from a poem , though Arminius thought the poem was in Greek , not Latin . He knew there was such a thing as Greek , and that Romans with a fancy education spoke it , but it remained a closed scroll to him . <p> And he had no time to worry about poetry anyhow , whether in Greek , Latin , or his own tongue . Another Pannonian was trying to murder him . The man 's thrust almost pierced him  --  the son of a whore even fought like a Roman . The fellow sheltered behind his own big scutum . Beating down his guard would n't be easy . Arminius ' slashes gashed the thick leather facing of the Pannonian 's shield , but that did n't harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legionaries slammed into the rebels ' flank . After that , the fight was n't a fight any more . It was a rout . The Pannonians realized what they should have seen sooner : they were desperately outnumbered , out in the open , and had no hope of reinforcement , nor any strongpoint to which they might escape . They were , in a word , trapped . <p> Arminius ' foe suddenly had to face two other German auxiliaries , as the men they 'd been fighting took to their heels . He had no trouble holding off one foe . He could n't turn enough directions at once to hold off three . One of the other Germans hamstrung him . He went down with a wail . Arminius ' stroke across his throat finished him off . <p> " This is the way it 's supposed to work ! " said the auxiliary who 'd wounded him , wiping blood from his blade on a grassy tussock . <p> " By the gods , it is , " Arminius agreed . " Let 's finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " So it should . We do n't want to let those Roman greedyguts take more than their share , either , the way they like to do , " the other man said . <p> " I was thinking the same thing a little while ago , " Arminius replied . " Come on ! We do n't want to let any of these cursed fools get away . " <p> He loped after the Pannonians , who were frankly fleeing now . The westering sun stretched his shadow out ahead of him . The other Germans followed . War made a grand game  --  when you were winning . <p> Quinctilius Varus stepped from the gangplank to the pier with a sigh of relief . He did n't like traveling by ship , which did n't mean he could n't do it at need . He 'd got from Ostia  --  Rome 's port  --  to Massilia by sea faster than he could have by land . The rest of the journey , up to the legions ' base by the Rhine , would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close his eyes and appear there . For that matter , he wished he could close his eyes and have somebody else appear there . But he was the man Augustus wanted in that spot , the man Augustus wanted doing that job . It was an honor . All of his friends said so . They all seemed glad it was an honor he had and they did n't . None of them had shown the slightest desire to accompany him to the frontier . <p> Neither had his wife . " If my great-uncle said you have to go to Germany , then you do , " Claudia Pulchra had said . " He did n't say anything about my going , and I do n't intend to . " She 'd made him very happy in bed till his sailing time came round . He hoped she was n't making someone else very happy happy in bed right now  --  or , if she was , he hoped she was discreet about it . If Augustus could send his own daughter to an island for being too open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think twice about banishing a grand-niece . <p> No matter what Claudia Pulchra was doing , Varus had to make the best of things here . He looked at Massilia from the pier , and found himself pleasantly surprised . " Not too bad , " he said . <p> " Not too good , either , " Aristocles said darkly . The pedisequus liked sailing even less than Varus did  --  his stomach rebelled on the water . He did n't seem to realize he was on dry land again at last . <p> But Varus meant what he 'd said . Massilia was n't Rome  --  no other place came close , not even Alexandria  --  or Antioch or Athens . But it was a perfectly respectable provincial town . Greeks had settled the southern coast of Gaul somewhere not long after Rome was founded . And Gallia Narbonensis had been a Roman province much longer than the wilder lands farther north . True , Caesar 's soldiers had besieged and sacked Massilia a lifetime ago , when it made the mistake of backing Pompey . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The temple to Apollo near the center of town was particularly fine , dominating the view from the harbor . <p> " Who will you be , sir ? " a dockside lounger asked Varus in Greek-accented Latin . " I can tell you 're somebody , and no mistake . " <p> " I am Publius Quinctilius Varus , the new governor of Germany , on my way from Rome to take my post there , " Varus answered grandly . He nodded to Aristocles , who flipped the lounger a coin . " Will you be good enough to let the local leaders know I have arrived ? " <p> The man popped the coin into his mouth . Most people carried small change between their cheek and jaw . Varus had himself in his younger days . Aristocles handled mundanities like money now . " I sure will , your honor , " the Massiliote said , and hurried away . <p> If he took the silver and disappeared . . . Well , what could Varus do about it ? Nothing much . But the fellow proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town 's duumvirs  --  its paired executives , as consuls were the paired executives in Rome as a whole  --  hurried to the harbor to greet their distinguished visitor . By their Latin , they were Italians , not Greeks . One was tall and lean , the other short and stocky . Varus forgot their names as soon as he heard them . The tall one sold olive oil all over Gaul ; the stocky one sold wine  --  or maybe it was the other way around . <p> Each duumvir invited him to a feast that evening . By the way they glared at each other , the one whose house he did n't choose would hate him forever after . So he said , " I 'll stay a couple of days before going north . Why do n't I have my slave toss a coin to see which of you I visit first ? " <p> As he 'd hoped , that satisfied them both . " You know how to grease things , do n't you , your Excellency ? " said the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who sold oil . <p> " I try , " Varus answered . <p> " Can you grease things up in Germany ? " the squat one asked , which confused Varus all over again . <p> " I intend to try , " he said . " Can you gentlemen tell me what it 's like up by the Rhine ? " <p> Almost in unison , they shook their heads . They were Italians , sure enough ; a Greek would have dipped his to show he meant no . The tall one said , " You would n't catch me up there  --  not unless Augustus ordered me there , I mean . " He made a quick recovery . Then he continued , " I 'd rather stay here . The weather 's better  --  not so chilly , not so damp . And there are n't any savages around here . " <p> " My job is to turn them into provincials , " Varus said . <p> " Good fortune go with you , " the two duumvirs said together . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sorry son of a whore , but it might as well have been . <p> " The Germans do buy wine , " the stocky one added . " Not much of a market there for oil , I 'm afraid . They use butter instead . " He made a face to show what he thought of that . Since Varus thought the same thing , he made a face , too . If butter did n't mark a true barbarian , what did ? <p> " And they drink beer , " the tall one said , which answered that question . He went on , " They like wine better , though , when they can get hold of it . " <p> " Who would n't ? " Varus said . Both duumvirs nodded . <p> " Maybe you can teach them to like olive oil , too , " the short one said . " The Gauls use more of it than they did before Caesar conquered them . " <p> " If I can pacify the Germans , they 're welcome to keep eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Varus exclaimed . <p> " I can see that , " the stocky duumvir said judiciously . " Maybe you do n't have the biggest load on your shoulders this side of Atlas holding up the heavens , but not far from it , eh ? " <p> Varus thought the same thing , though Augustus did n't seem to . He could n't tell these fellows how he felt , or it might get back to the ruler of the Roman world . Things had an unfortunate way of doing that . He wanted Augustus to go on having confidence in him , which meant he had to act like a man who had confidence in Augustus . He said , " By all the reports that have come down to Rome , there 's been real progress the past few years . I 've got to put the stopper in the jug and seal it with pitch , that 's all . " <p> The duumvirs glanced at each other for a moment . Varus had the feeling they did n't like each other much , but they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they chorused again , and he was sure it meant the same thing this time as it had before . <p> Excerpted from GIVE ME BACK MY LEGIONS by HARRY TURTLEDOVE <br> Copyright 2009 by Harry Turtledove <br> Published in April 2009 by St. Martin
