IS IT TIME TO RE-COVER YOUR CHAIR AND SOFA ? FIND THE OPTION THAT BEST FITS YOUR BUDGET , YOUR LIFESTYLE , AND YOUR TASTE . // Whether you 're incorporating a hand-me-down sofa into your living room or simply sprucing up outdated upholstery , re-covering furniture in complementary fabrics can transform mismatched parts into stylish wholes . Reasons to consider refurbishing old pieces are Construction ( it 's better to update sturdy antique and vintage furniture than replace them with lesser-quality pieces ) , design ( the look of a favorite armchair may prove difficult to find again ) , and cost ( new covers are generally priced far lower than new furniture ) . To make your decision just a little easier , we tried three options on the sofa and armchair above-reupholstery , custom slipcovers , and Sure Fit slipcovers . To see the results , please turn the page . To reupholster furniture , existing fabric is stripped off the frame and new fabric is draped and molded In its place , ( If a frame needs to be tightened or cushions restuffed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost will rise . ) The resulting reworking conforms to every curve , making this a natural choice for formal interiors or for furniture with especially graceful forms . For our sofa and armchair , we opted for tactile fabrics in warm caramel tones . A soft mohair blend covers the body of the sofa ; in place of the two original seat cushions , we selected one long cushion and covered It with cut velvet in a complementary shade . ( A coordinating cut-velvet pillow rests on the armchair . ) Velvet trim on the cushions enhances the armchair 's herringbone fabric . Details like the sofa 's fringe and the chair 's exposed nailheads add extra texture . Custom slipcovers follow the contours of your furniture , resulting in a look that is tailored but a bit looser and more casual than upholstery . Because slipcovers can be removed for cleaning , they are ideal for households with young children or pets . They are also a good bet for beach houses or weekend homes , where sand and dirt are often inadvertently carried indoors . Depending on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more suitable for dry cleaning ( canvas versus silk , for instance ) ; analyze your household 's particular needs before making your final decision . For this project , we chose neutral fabrics in an array of textures : For the body of the sofa , we used an off-white matelasse . Brown-and-white ticking covers the cushion-a fun twist on a traditional look . Cream damask swathes the armchair . Sidebar TIME &; COST UPHOLSTERY Reupholstering a chair or sofa involves a certain investment of time and money . Your furniture will be in the workshop at least one to two weeks . The whole process can take upwards of six to eight weeks , factoring in reviewing samples and fabric delivery . Depending on the size and form of the piece to be covered , reupholstery can cost about $400 to $800 for an armchair and $1,000 to $2,000 for a sofa , not including the price of the fabric . CUSTOM SLIPCOVERS In terms of cost and the amount of time it takes , Grafting custom-fitted slipcovers approximates upholstery . But if you select a company that sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric cuts , you can keep your furniture while the covers are being constructed at the workshop . SURE FIT SLIPCOVERS Available through the mail and at home design stores around the country , Sure Fit slipcovers are the quickest and least-expensive option of the three . Depending on the type of fabric and style of cover , prices range from about $50 to $80 for armchairs and about $100 to $200 for sofas . Sidebar BEFORE YOU BEGIN ASSESS YOUR ROOM to determine which re-covering approach and which fabric patterns would be best for you . Questions to ask yourself : What decorating style do you prefer ? ( Laid-back country ? More modern ? ) What is the room usually used for ? ( Formal entertaining ? Family TV nights ? ) What size is the room ? ( Bright colors and bold graphics can be overpowering , while light hues visually expand small spaces . ) ASSESS YOUR LIFESTYLE . As important as the design details of your home are the everyday details about how you live . Do toddlers and four-footed friends enjoy free rein in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Likewise , do the rules in your house mandate that shoes be removed at the door or can feet-shoes and all-rest on the furniture ? CARRY SWATCHES of drapery , paint color , or carpeting with you to the fabric store to help you find the best matches . Snapshots of the room can be helpful as well . Bring home swatches of the patterns you 're considering and lay them over the furniture to get an idea of how they will look with other pieces in the room . See how sunlight and indirect light affect the colors at differing times of the day . // <p>
