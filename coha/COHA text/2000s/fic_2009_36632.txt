1 <p> SCORPIO : <p> With Mercury falling into a particularly difficult retrograde , the best advice for you is to JUST STAY HOME . All communications with senior management are fraught with difficulty , and it is best to keep your own counsel . <p> Penelope Mercury had n't meant to quit her job without another one waiting in the wings . <p> In fact , she had n't meant to quit at all . <p> Nor had she meant to set the back photo studio on fire . <p> And it was a complete accident that she had thrown up all over her boss . <p> But , well , she had . <p> That Wednesday started off pretty much like every other day for Penelope , with a harsh six a.m. wakeup call from the notoriously indecisive morning news editor of the New York Telegraph , Dan Martman , aka " Martman , " who suffered from a severe Napoleonic complex . ( " Both ' complex one , ' teeny tiny height , and the more nefarious ' complex two , ' teeny tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neal DuBoix . " He 's not only short , but Farrah in Business slept with him once and said he 's really edited for length , you know ... down there ... " ) <p> Not surprisingly , Martman made up for his indecisiveness and famous shortcomings in volume and ferocity . " Mercury ! " he screamed down the early morning line , jolting Penelope out of a deep sleep . " Some asshole got into a fight with his girlfriend and threw her cat out of her fourteenth-floor apartment window in Evergreen Gardens , you know , in the Soundview section of the Bronx . Get the girlfriend , get a picture of the dead cat when it was still an alive cat , and interview the neighbors ! Go ! Go ! Go ! " <p> " Do we have her address ? " Penelope asked , grabbing for her bedside notepad and pen as Martman rambled off the number and street of the unfortunate cat lady . " And is she gon na let me in or is this a blind drop-in ? " Her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . The sky was a heavy , unfortunate color of gray and snow covered the ground . She quickly added , " I 'm still kind of sick from doorstepping in Queens during last week 's blizzard and today does n't look like it 's gon na be much better . " <p> One of the more unattractive aspects of being a general assignment reporter or " G.A.R. " ( an acronym pronounced similarly to the sound one made when sent out on assignment to some hellhole )  --  besides the low pay  --  was that the GAR spent much of her ( its ) professional life " doorstepping . " This meant standing outside someone 's home who may have had something newsworthy ( read : terrible ) happen to them , waiting for him or her to come in or out so as to grab a quote or a picture , while evading fists , snarling dogs , and curses and simultaneously trying to jam one 's foot in the door before it closed and locked indefinitely . Doorstepping could take hours and you could n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if you missed your target and God forbid someone from the Post or the Daily News got them instead of you , your ass was Martman grass . <p> " Who fucking cares if there 's a storm ? It 's your goddamn job ! " Martman yelled into the phone . <p> Before Martman could hang up on her or work himself into more of a lather , Penelope tried to ask him about the court reporting position that had just opened up , the one she had volubly coveted for five years . <p> " Well , okay , but did you make a decision on Kershank 's job ? You said I was the frontrun  --  " <p> " Just get the goddamn story ! " Martman screamed , cutting her off before hanging up . <p> Sammy Kershank had given notice a month earlier to go work for Newsweek , leaving his job as a Manhattan court reporter tantalizingly open . Penelope , who 'd been slaving away under Martman 's iron fist , proving herself as a GAR , had been eyeing the position since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Penelope sighed . She wanted that job more than anything she 'd ever wanted in her life . She pushed play on her CD alarm clock that was shoved into the corner of her bed ( alongside her makeshift " desk area " of notebooks , pens , and tissues ) . " She works hard for the money , " Donna Summer belted out , " so hard for it honey , so you better treat her right  --  alright ! " <p> You tell ' em , Donna . Penelope smiled as she hacked out a cough , giving Ms. Summer a mental high five as she threw her slightly yellowed down comforter off and blew her nose in one of the tissues that was tucked in beside the alarm clock . <p> Penelope had moved to New York in 2002 after four years of struggling through a journalism major at Ohio State University ( academia was never her thing ) , not too far from her hometown of Cincinnati , brimming with dreams of a Pulitzer and all the usual excitement of a recent New York transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan Street between Prince and Houston in the hip area of Soho by calling a number on the front of the building that had read , " Apartments : No Fee . " The fourth-floor walk-up was only a thousand dollars a month . More accustomed to Ohio real estate prices , Penelope did n't realize it was a steal . ( " I always thought that for a grand a month I 'd get a terrace or at least a real bathroom , " she 'd said to Neal , who 'd responded , " Dorothy , you 're not in Ohio anymore " ) . <p> It turned out to be so cheap for New York because the bedroom was small enough that it could fit only a full-sized bed and a dresser  --  which she 'd fortuitously found on the street corner two weeks after she 'd moved in . Despite having a few water stains on the top , it was a beautiful cherry wood and worked perfectly . The kitchen sink in the tiny room that held a half-stove and a fridge doubled as the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two closets on either side of the living room  --  one of which hid a toilet , and the other disguised a shower . <p> The living room was a misnomer . It was ten feet by ten feet and did n't leave very much room to live in at all . But Penelope had managed to squeeze in a small futon from IKEA ( prized for its ability to deconstruct and get through the door more than for any other reason ) , a glass coffee table , and a small cozy chair that looked like a faux-leather La-Z-Boy but did n't lounge back . On the bright side , coffee drips on pleather could be wiped away like nothing ever happened . <p> " It used to be an old tenement building , and no one was supposed to have their own bathroom , " the old man who was to become her landlord said . " So we made do . But it 's got its original tin ceilings and hardwood floors . Do n't eat too much in here , though . There are rats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Penelope took the apartment immediately , despite the palpable presence of rats and absence of terrace , more out of necessity than anything else , and set about getting a reporting job . After a brief and unhappy internship at a financial weekly that lasted the duration of a single issue , she met someone who knew someone who got her a job as a copy kid at the New York Telegraph , a tabloid with headlines like " Kabloomie ! " ( about American troops bombing poppy fields in Afghanistan ) or " I-say-ah You 're Fired ! " ( about Isaiah Thomas being dismissed from the Knicks after losing a sexual harassment case against a coworker he 'd continually referred to as a " bitch " ) . <p> Two years later Penelope was promoted from copy kid  --  where basic duties included getting coffee for any editor who felt thirsty and lazy ( basically , all of them ) , collecting packages from the messenger center , running errands , and sorting mail  --  to general assignment reporter . She was a great GAR . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous questions , and could gain almost anyone 's trust . <p> The job had also helped decorate her apartment for free and thus , seven years later , reflected her many travels throughout the boroughs of New York . Above her bed was a large Jackson Pollock-esque drip oil painting that Sherry , the homeless woman/artist who 'd rescued a dog from certain death off the subway tracks in Chelsea during rush hour ( " Bum Ride ! " page 12 , lead story , September 18 , 2002 ) , had pulled from her shopping cart and given to Penelope after Penelope had taken her to lunch during their interview . In the living room there was a small wooden chair in the corner with an embroidered seat cushion that Mrs. Blackstone , who ran a thrift shop in Crown Heights that had been burgled ( " Burglar Breaks in Looking for a Steal , " page 21 , bottom story , April 7 , 2005 ) , had sold her at a steep discount . Penelope had received the 1940s Formica kitchen table gratis from the Grubmans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , he was the escape artist  --  who were cleaning out their storage closet as Penelope interviewed them about Mrs. Grubman 's beard catching on fire during an unfortunate incident with the flame swallower ( " Beard Burn ! " page 19 , right-hand column , July 25 , 2004 ) . And all over the walls and fridge were other collected artwork and personal treasures that Penelope had picked up while on various assignments : a Ghanaian bust from Harlem , an Indian painting of the goddess Shiva she 'd gotten during a story in Bellerose , Queens , a watercolor of Athens from Astoria , a tiny Torah from Borough Park , and a kitschy set of Russian nesting dolls she 'd gotten as a gift from Olga , a Russian escort from Brighton Beach , after Penelope had convinced the Telegraph to pay Olga 's bail during the 2006 Russian hooker crackdown in exchange for an exclusive interview ( " Mayor Rages : No More Russkie Rent Girls ! " the entire front page or " The Wood " as it was known at the paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olga the number of a nearby shelter and a women 's support group , but figured Olga probably would n't use either . <p> Besides artwork and furniture , she 'd also picked up her best , and pretty much only , friend . She 'd met Neal , a chic interior decorator for the city 's elite , during a stakeout four years earlier . She doorstepped him during a thunderstorm after his ex-boyfriend , Bernard Bertrand , a dog groomer who 'd owned a store called Doggy ' Do and Pussies Too ! attempted to burn down the Madison Avenue apartment of Nan Thrice , Neal 's society queen client , after Neal broke up with him . The society queen 's social standing made her interesting to the paper , but Penelope knew nothing about her . After five hours of sitting on his stoop in the rain , chain smoking under a flimsy black umbrella , Neal had taken pity on her , invited her inside , and given her an exclusive interview . She 'd been his " little work in progress " ever since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lena Lippencrass , and from the stories Neal always told about Lena , she sounded like she could be even more of a project than Penelope . Neal called her " Lipstick Carcrash , " for reasons he refused to tell Penelope but which she assumed were due to Lipstick 's glamorous job at the fashion magazine Y and her unfortunate habit of colliding with any kind of obstacle , be it a step , an errant tree limb , or a man . <p> " I 've seen the entire world by subway , " Penelope told Neal . After seven years at the Telegraph , she figured she knew one person from almost every community on every block in New York and had probably written about them . <p> But all the really good , juicy stories were uncovered in the court system . Penelope had refused offers of other beats in hopes of being available once her dream job opened up . She did n't want to get sidetracked . Two years earlier she 'd even turned down the transport beat , despite the minor pay increase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me out of the running for courts forever , " Penelope explained to Neal . " The transport guys never advance in the paper . Lou Francis was on it for six years and had a heart attack , Kwani Hadebe was so bored with that beat he chose to go back to copyediting , and the only person who went anywhere semi-interesting after working transport was Christine Pride  --  who left for WKBC to do their traffic updates . She 's now known as the ' Car Cutie . ' " <p> The hierarchy at the Telegraph was complicated . If you took the right job , you moved up within the paper . If you took the wrong job , you were condemned to that desk forever . Penelope preferred to stay in the GAR pool and still be considered than to sell herself short for an extra five thousand dollars a year , even if that extra five grand would 've meant she could stop working the ten hours of overtime a week that ensured Penelope could pay her rent , and maybe have a semblance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long was proving to be a tricky game . It was an unwritten rule at the Telegraph that if you were in one position for more than five years , you were considered a " lifer " in that specific job . And Penelope , whose five-year clock was ticking , did not want to be a GAR lifer . GAR lifers eventually become " rewrites "  --  rewriting wire copy and putting in random phone calls to back up the work of the street GARs . While the workload was easier and the chance of being fired without a lawsuit was slim to none , GAR lifers ' careers were DOA  --  no chance of promotion or pay hike . Penelope called them " floaters "  --  a term she also used to refer to the little bits of poop that refused to flush in the toilet . ( " No matter what they do  --  or do n't do  --  they just keep popping back up . " ) Penelope lived in terror of a potential GAR-to-floater career trajectory . <p> So when Kershank gave notice , Penelope began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working overtime and even when sick . She 'd started dropping by Martman 's desk every day at least twice , showering him with compliments ( " You look so great today , Martman , did you get a haircut ? " " Is that a new cologne ? It 's amazing " ) , and peppering him with her knowledge of the court system , picked up from years of watching Court TV and Law &amp; Order . <p> Martman , a man who was more susceptible to flattery than any actual display of court knowledge , seemed open to the idea of Penelope replacing Kershank and just last week said , " You 're the front-runner ! Now get to Coney Island and get me that midget and his mermaid lover . Now ! " <p> Penelope groaned . It was too early and cold for the Bronx , but she consoled herself with the thought that it was only for a day or two more . She lumbered out of bed to the kitchen sink , where she brushed her teeth and washed her face . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but decided to take a shower later and put on her " doorstepping " armor . First , long underwear ( top and bottom ) then a pair of jeans , a T-shirt , and a long-sleeved crewneck sweater , which she layered under a turtleneck sweater and a cardigan . After lacing up her hiking boots , she donned her long pink puffer coat , which Neal had begged her for years to ditch , that made her look like a small pink Michelin man . " Helloooo , gorgeous ! " Penelope said to her reflection in the mirror . <p> Penelope rolled her long , dark blond curly hair into a bun and made a futile attempt to tame the frizzes that were creating a halo around her head . Good enough ! she thought and danced over to the CD/radio alarm clock , cutting off Donna Summer at " Lookin ' for some hot stuff baby this evenin ' , I need some hot stuff baby toniiiight ! " <p> She grabbed her hefty reporter 's bag  --  which carried a notebook , several chewed-up pens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deodorant  --  and shut off the apartment lights before making her way out onto Sullivan Street . <p> The weather had been forecasted as fifteen degrees with a winter storm on the way , but with the wind chill it felt at least twenty degrees colder , and the mixture of snow and sleet blowing perpendicularly into her face made it worse . Shivering , Penelope fought her way against the wind up Sixth Avenue to the West Fourth Street subway station four blocks away . After slipping twice on the stairs leading down to the trains , she finally made it onto the platform and hopped on the A train heading for one of the high-rise buildings in the Evergreen Gardens projects  --  which was neither green nor surrounded by gardens . <p> Libra : <p> Mercury , the cosmic trickster , is about to play havoc on your life . Shun making important decisions during this time as some crucial piece of information , or component , has gone astray or awry . <p> Fifteen blocks and about twenty worlds away , in a duplex garden apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lippencrass 's alarm clock went off at exactly 7:25 a.m . <p> Lena yawned , waking from her Ambien-induced slumber with the cool cucumber slices that she had gingerly put on her eyes the night before still in place . She stretched and , slapping off the alarm , dropped the cucumber slices into the HermTs ashtray wedged in between the clock and the crystal block lamp on her nightstand , which also concealed Lipstick 's personal items : pens , hair ties , her prescription stash of Ambien , Xanax in a pillbox shaped like a FabergT egg ( " so Kate Moss " ) , Klonopin  --  for dire occasions  --  and the new diet pills Dr. Sachs on East Eighty-fourth had started prescribing to the social set ( " They 're amazing ! " said Lena 's mother , Lana Lippencrass . " I lost twenty pounds in two weeks  --  at that rate you can be practically Somalian by the Met Gala , darling ! " ) . <p> Lipstick fumbled around to the right side of the bed to what looked like the other nightstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that held small bottles of Poland Spring water and more cucumber slices in a bowl of water  --  freshly cut by Gloria , the maid , who came every Tuesday and Thursday . Opening the fridge , Lipstick grabbed a bottle of water and downed it . Dehydration was a killer . <p> It was pitch black in her room , thanks to the double-weight drapes that concealed the entire glass wall to the left of the bed , which led to her Parisian-style garden , with the exception of the faint glow from her laptop lying on the pillow next to her head . It was in that exact spot where her ex , Thad Newton III , had laid his disheveled blond , genetically blessed head comfortably for two years until Lipstick saw a photo of him  --  posted on the socialite gossip website , Socialstatus.com  --  drunkenly tongue-wrestling with her nemesis , Bitsy Farmdale . She 'd dismissed him instantly after seeing that distressing Web post eight months ago , and the right side of the bed had been empty of human content ever since . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known him for almost a decade . And it was because of him that she 'd been given her unusual moniker by her dearest friend , Neal , whose father Dennis had been close friends with Lipstick 's father , Martin , since their Harvard days . <p> Lipstick had been on summer break between her freshman and sophomore years at Princeton and had just gotten her driver 's license at the ripe old age of twenty . She 'd been driving Neal out to the Hamptons in her mother 's BMW , where they 'd planned to spend the weekend dining at Sant Ambroeus , playing tennis and going to cocktail parties . Lipstick was , in particular , excited about Nelly Hooper 's beach barbecue later that evening where she was hoping to see Thad Newton III , whom she 'd spent the previous weekend flirting with . <p> " He 's already called twice to make sure I 'm coming ! " Lipstick said gleefully , not paying particular attention to the road . " But I think Bitsy may have gotten her claws into him first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Neal asked , buckling his seat belt as Lipstick veered onto the shoulder of the Long Island Expressway for a moment before correcting the wheel . " Did n't he come from Rhode Island ? " <p> " He 's perfect , " Lipstick said , taking Exit 70 to get to Montauk Highway . " He 's a banker at J.P . Morgan , lives on the Upper East Side  --  west of Park Avenue  --  went to Dartmouth , his family owns the biggest house in Newport and a cottage in Provence , and he 's texting me ! Can you believe it ? " <p> " He almost sounds like your father . I 'm sure your mother is excited , " Neal said , smirking . <p> " Excited ? Why do you think she let me drive her car out ? I told her all about him and said the only way we 'd make it to Nelly 's in time was to drive  --  otherwise we 'd be on the Jitney with the rest of the serfs . " Lipstick licked her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass me my lipstick ? I need to refresh . " <p> Neal reached back behind the driver 's seat and grabbed Lipstick 's Gucci tote . Rummaging through it he found her Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick and quipped , " Slumming it with Revlon , huh ? What happened to the MAC Viva Glam I gave you ? " <p> Ignoring him , Lipstick grabbed the makeup and , disregarding traffic , artfully reapplied the color to her lips while looking in the rearview mirror . All would have been fine had that damn curve in Route 27  --  which Lipstick swore she knew by heart  --  not appeared out of nowhere . As she was putting on her final touches to her bottom lip , the BMW ran off the road into the guardrail , and Lipstick 's lipstick smeared across her face , a graphic war wound . It was truly a Lipstick Carcrash  --  a name Neal had lovingly called her ever since , but which Lipstick had forbade him to tell anyone else the provenance of . <p> Neal , laughing hysterically , had pulled some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that she looked almost normal . Meanwhile , the damage to the car was fairly superficial and Lipstick still made it to Nelly 's just in time to see Thad whisper sweet nothings in Bitsy 's ear . <p> Lipstick had n't seen Thad for several years after that incident until she ran into him at the American Museum of Natural History 's winter gala . By then Bitsy was out of the picture and Lipstick was back in for the next two years . <p> " I should have paid more attention , " Lipstick later grumbled to Neal . " The universe was trying to warn me off him the first time around . " <p> Lipstick opened her laptop , and the screen immediately went from the hazy blue of sleep mode to Socialstatus.com , which she 'd been reading prior to falling asleep . The main page was a scroll of photos and captions  --  the one she 'd been obsessed with the night before was a picture of Bitsy with Thad at the Newton family 's New Year 's Eve gala in Rhode Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power Couple Ever ? ? ? " ) to read the comments , from the supportive ( " Bitsy is the new Aerin Lauder . All class and beauty " ) to the snide ( " If she wants a ring so badly , she should have taken note of Mrs. Newton 's dress code for the evening : Rhode Island preppy , not New York formal " ) to the outright nasty ( " Someone should tell Bitsy Thad likes bank accounts , not women . Rhode Island is scruffy old money  --  but it has n't appreciated well . He 's only with her because LL dumped him . And LL 's daddy is worth more  --  definitely the BBD : Bigger Better Deal between those two " ) . <p> Lipstick always felt dirty after reading the website , which was run by two mean queens in San Francisco , but over the years it had come to rule young New York society . Everybody liked to see pictures of themselves , and unlike the society magazines , Avenue , Quest , or Town &amp; Country , viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty or untrue it was . And best of all  --  the young up-and-coming socialites could rank themselves , creating a tangible popularity game , keeping them forever  --  no matter how old  --  in high school . <p> Lipstick took a deep breath and clicked refresh on the website to see that week 's results : Bitsy Farmdale was first . Lipstick was sixth . <p> Disappointed , Lipstick shut the laptop , sighed , and took one last cuddle underneath her thousand-count Frette sheets before hopping out of the king-sized bed she 'd specially ordered from the Four Seasons Hotel . She ambled across the white Persian carpet covering the ebonized fishbone floors and , opening the drapes , momentarily blinded herself with the light . She stumbled backward into one of the two nailhead chairs that framed the fireplace , stubbing her toe . <p> Beyond the nailhead chairs was the creamy limestone bathroom , complete with a " rain room " shower with two oversized ceiling nozzles , a limestone bench , and steam capability . There was also a large egg-shaped limestone tub and a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipstick , in red Juicy sweatpants and a tank top , thought , eyeing her image in the mirror . Despite eating shellfish last night , her eyes were n't as puffy as she 'd thought they 'd be . Best of all , her ass did n't seem to have been affected by the dinner with her Y magazine coworkers during which she had succumbed to all five courses at Daniel and endured their uncomfortable stares and whispers for the entire meal . " You 're really going to chub out this time , " Muffie Dinklage , the senior fashion editor , whispered to Lipstick over her soufflT . <p> But that had n't happened . Yet . She was n't exactly thin , per se , but Lipstick was an Amazonian blue blood . She was n't fat , just big boned , and being five feet , ten inches  --  over six feet in heels  --  did n't help . But she did try to stay in shape by dabbling with Pilates or Cardio Funk  --  whatever was in that particular month  --  and made it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once a week . Lipstick loved Sally , who was not just a yoga teacher , but had , over the years , become a friend and she showed Lipstick how to help maintain her body without starving herself . Had Lipstick devoted her life to the method study of anorexia like some of her Spence schoolmates , she could have modeled . Lipstick was classically beautiful with big brown eyes and full lips . Her prominent nose fit her face and had n't been chopped down by Dr. Dan Baker , as had the noses of most of the socialites she knew . Her sandy brown hair fell below her shoulder blades in a long , layered Gisele Bundchen way that was artfully streaked blond by Rita Starnella of the Warren Tricomi Salon every month . <p> Not that her father , Martin Lippencrass , or her mother , Lana , who was the current president of the Daughters of the American Revolution , would have let her model . " Just look at those tacky Hearsts . " Lana had gasped upon picking up Harper 's Bazaar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst  --  on the cover . " Have they no shame ? Her grandfather is rolling in his grave right now . She 's not even doing it for charity ! " Besides , Lipstick would n't have been able to do it anyway . An innate insecurity and inability to sit still would have stopped any modeling career in its tracks . In all of the Lippencrass family photos , Lipstick 's shoulders were slightly hunched to cover up her height , and she was always biting her lip or the inside of her cheek when she should have been smiling . <p> Lipstick glanced at her watch . She needed to get going . Today was meeting day . <p> After her shower Lipstick went into the walk-in closet , a former third bedroom that now housed her clothing collection . It was packed with the thousands of dresses , skirts , jeans , pants , blouses , purses , and shoes Lipstick had lovingly compiled over the years . Behind the door hung a Polaroid camera and a quilted bulletin board covered with photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , Jack Marshall , the imposing owner/editor/publisher of Y magazine , held an editorial meeting  --  insisting his staff forgo lunch , which he felt helped them lose extra weight ( and , according to Jack , everyone could stand to get rid of a few pounds )  --  and God help you if you were dressed in something twice , or worse , something he despised . Last week , the Polaroid showed she 'd worn a black Comme des Garcons dress with Manolo heels and a red Versace purse to the meeting . In the margin of the Polaroid was a note saying , " J hates red purse . Ditch . " The offending bag was now in the back of the closet with last season 's Prada . <p> After racing through several clothing racks and shoe shelves , Lipstick finally chose a pair of black wool Gucci pants , a brown Gucci sweater , a cream Calvin Klein blouse , a pair of black patent leather Dolce &amp; Gabbana heels , and a Marc Jacobs patent leather satchel . <p> She snapped a quick Polaroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the apartment , and caught a cab to the offices of Y magazine . <p> Scorpio : <p> Mercury wreaks havoc with your senses ... and sinuses . All business should be put on hold as nothing is bound to get done anyway . <p> Round about that time , at approximately 8:30 a.m. , Penelope popped out of the subway onto the Bronx streets like a large , layered , pink jack-in-the-box . Sweating from the heat of the subway and the effort of dragging her bag up three flights of stairs , the second she hit the fresh , subzero air above ground , she felt a chill as her perspiration began to freeze . For a quick , hot second , she wished she had taken her father 's advice to become a certified public accountant . <p> Her morning soundtrack was still playing in her head , tunes now courtesy of Foreigner . " You 're as cold as ice , you 're willing to sacrifice our loooove ... " <p> By the time she reached the building  --  a particularly rundown high-rise in a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather improbably managed to get worse ( " You want paradise , but someday you 'll pay the price , I knoooow ... " ) . And no one seemed to be home in apartment 14B , much to her dismay . <p> This is not a good sign . But I 'll be in courts soon . In a nice , dry courtroom , miles away from Martman and paragraphs away from the front page ... I 'll wait out that cat woman if it takes me all day . I 'll even interview the dead cat if I have to ... <p> The wind whipped up the clouds and , as Penelope shivered under the minuscule concrete canopy of the high-rise waiting for the dead cat lady to emerge from her apartment or even answer her buzzer , sleet continued to blow sideways , straight into her face . <p> Across the street , in the cozy confines of his once silvery blue but now fully rusted 1989 Honda Civic , was Bert Salvino , the staff photographer who 'd been sent to meet her and get pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how wonderful the dead cat was or how horrible the now ex-boyfriend was . Bert , a forty-two-year-old with a greasily sparse comb-over who smelled like he had n't bathed since 1996 , was sitting in his aesthetically crappy but warm and dry hatchback . The car only had one seat  --  the driver 's seat . Bert hated everyone  --  especially " dickhead reporters "  --  so much that he 'd ripped out all of the other seats so that he , legally , would n't be able to chauffeur anyone else , anywhere , ever . <p> Bert was always sent as a last resort . His refusal to get out of his car meant that he almost always missed the shot  --  and when he did get it , it was inevitably blurry . He should have been fired , but he was on disability . After 9/11 , which Bert and every other photographer and reporter at the paper had been sent to cover , Bert had claimed that he 'd tripped over a part of the fallen towers , busting his knee . Six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months , despite perfect X-rays and several newsroom eyewitness accounts that he had never actually gotten closer to Ground Zero than Canal Street , about fifteen blocks north of where the twin towers had once stood . <p> When she saw Bert 's car parked in front of the high-rise , Penelope called Martman to question the paper 's choice of photographer for the day , enraging him even further . " Listen , I ca n't stand the guy either , but you try and fire a disabled guy  --  I 'd have a lawsuit on my ass in a second , " Martman screamed . " And besides , he 's all we got  --  there was a triple homicide in Midtown , so stop bitching and get me that fucking cat lady ! " <p> Two hours and three inches of snow later , there was still no sign of life from the building and no one in 14B was answering the buzzer , which Penelope had been dutifully pressing with one frozen finger every five minutes , conserving body heat and warmth by only moving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one working finger . <p> At 10:35 a.m. , just as a thin layer of ice was forming on the outside of Penelope 's coat and she was morphing from small Michelin man to large strawberry Sno-Cone , Martman called again . <p> Penelope could n't feel her frostbitten fingers but somehow fished her phone out of her coat pocket and pushed talk . <p> " Mercury ! " said Martman . " Cat lady is in Queens ! Get there now ! " <p> " B-b-but , " Penelope protested , " I h-h-have b-b-been here f-f-for two hours already  --  " <p> " Mercury , stop complaining ! It was a cock-up on our end . Just get me the cat lady ! Now ! " And after rattling off the new address in rapid-fire , Martman hung up on her . <p> A near-frozen Penelope waddled over to Bert 's Honda and knocked on the windshield . <p> Bert , reclining in the Civic in a summery outfit of T-shirt and jeans , topped only by a thin , zip-up fleece jacket , leaned over and grudgingly rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone and ignored her . Penelope was mesmerized by the heat emanating from the inch of open window . It was smelly heat , but it was still heat . She stuck her fingers on the rim of the pane to try and get any part of her body warm as she leaned in to shout through the open slot . <p> " B-b-bert , " Penelope stammered , " w-w-e have t-t-to go to Queens  --  " <p> " Yeah , I know , " Bert said as he hung up his phone , " just got the call . See you there . " And with that , he rolled up the window , put the Honda in drive , and peeled off . <p> " I hope you b-b-break down on the T-t-triboro Bridge ! " Penelope screamed after the disappearing car , before picking up her bag and trudging back to the subway . <p> Penelope 's cough had worsened , and she began to wonder if she might have pneumonia . I should have just taken a sick day , Penelope thought . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . She popped her last two Advil in the train station , got on the A train going downtown , and at Forty-second Street switched to the 7 , the local to Queens . <p> Sagittarius : <p> As Mercury swings around , get ready to deal with things you have put off in the past . It will not be pleasant , but necessary . <p> As Penelope made her way to Queens , Dana Gluck , who , up until that very moment , was well on her way to making her monthly quota in billable hours as a junior partner at Struck , Struck &amp; Kornberg , was forced to unbutton the skirt of her favorite Armani suit , thanks to the twenty pounds she 'd put on virtually overnight . To make matters worse , an hour into her fifteen-hour workday , Merck &amp; Co. , Inc. , her biggest client  --  worth more than ten million dollars in annual revenues to her firm  --  informed her that it had been poached by the wily rival law firm , Krath &amp; McGowan . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilize for lunch , the phone rang . <p> " Dana , are you sitting down ? " said Ruth Gluck . <p> " Yeah , Mom . " Dana sighed . " What 's up ? " <p> " I just ran into Noah 's mother at Kroger . " <p> " Oh , great . How is she ? " <p> " She 's pregnant . " <p> " Huh ? She 's like seventy ! " <p> " No . She is . " <p> Dana 's face went numb and her hand fell from her ear , dropping the phone onto the desk with a clatter . Something started buzzing loudly in her ears , and she could feel the bile rise from her stomach . Evya . That bitch . The mere suggestion of her ex-husband 's new wife knocked the wind out of Dana . <p> " Dana ? Dana ? Hello ? Dana ? " her mom 's voice squawked through the other end of the line . <p> Dana ran out of her office so fast she knocked her assistant down and barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Kornberg bathroom , where she sat on the toilet seat with her head in her hands , tears silently splashing onto her two-inch black patent leather Manolo Blahnik pumps . <p> Scorpio : <p> All methods of communication will be flawed , giving rise to personal misunderstandings . <p> An hour later Penelope exited the subway in Long Island City . The second she hit fresh air  --  and cell service  --  her phone beeped , full of messages . The first was from her mother . " Penelope , it 's your mother ... you have n't called me or your father back in a week . We are concerned . I mean , we could be dead , or dying and how would you know ? You would n't ! We 'd just be here , in Ohio , decomposing ... " Penelope sighed and pressed delete . <p> The next message was also from her mother . " And another thing . Are you dating anyone ? You 're not getting any younger you know  --  you 're twenty-eight ! Did you get the article I sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing ... " <p> Again , Penelope pressed delete . She was freezing enough out in the street , and dating had never been easy for her . Since she 'd been in New York , she had n't had much free time and the few men she 'd dated had hardly been memorable . Last year she 'd even tried Match.com , which had introduced her to Tony , a balding energy trader who had an annoying penchant for high-fiving everyone within earshot every time he made what he thought was an interesting comment ( " Yo , that dude looks like a lady  --  high five ! " or " Duke guys do it best  --  high five ! " ) . After high-fiving a guy , he would usually follow it up with a belly bump , a move Penelope referred to as the " sumo . " <p> Their first date had been woeful , but Penelope had decided to give Tony another chance as he 'd promised he 'd take her to Da Silvano , a trendy and pricey restaurant by her house that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken her to a sports bar in Midtown to watch the Yankees beat the Red Sox , where he 'd gotten so excited , he 'd not only high-fived her ( " Yeah ! Yankees rule ! High five ! " ) he 'd sumoed her and Penelope flew halfway across the room and landed on her ass ( " It 's not even post-season ! " Penelope said as nearby bar patrons helped her to her feet ) . She 'd called it quits after that , fearing permanent sumo-inflicted damage . <p> The last three calls were from Martman : " Mercury ! Abort cat lady mission , she already talked to the Daily News and the Post . We need you down on Wall Street  --  some asshole 's been selling World Trade Center rubble for five dollars a pop , like it 's the Berlin Wall or something . " <p> Next message : " Mercury ? Mercury ? Helloooo ... " <p> Final message : " Mercury ! Where the fuck are you ? I 've been trying to call you for an hour now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street now ! " <p> Penelope sighed . If she 'd felt any better she might have called Martman back and possibly demanded to use one of her three personal or ten vacation days . But two things held her back . First , a minor case of Stockholm syndrome , whereby she had grown accustomed to the abuse flung at her and instead of loathing her tormentor , was willing to jump through flaming hoops of fire to try to please him . And second , she really needed to impress him right now in order to secure Kershank 's job . Otherwise , she was doomed . <p> Still huddling away from the driving snow in a doorway in Queens , Penelope spied Ahmad Musharif 's corner bodega shining like a friendly beacon in the blizzard and ran for it . Ahmad 's bodega was right by the main subway line in Long Island City , a hub to the rest of Queens , and she visited every couple of months . She entered the store and waved to Ahmad before searching for tissues , a bottle of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialed Martman back , an overwhelming sense of Sisyphean dread enveloped her . What 's next ? Penelope thought . Staten Island ? <p> " Mercury ! Jesus Christ ! Where the fuck have you been ? " Martman bellowed when he answered . " The Daily Snooze and the Post got the cat lady in Brooklyn , the World Trade Center asshole has already been processed at central booking , and half the city is being shut down due to this storm and you go missing for hours . What the hell is going on ? Where are you  --  Bert 's been back in the office for half an hour ! " <p> " I'b id Queens . " Penelope sniffed . " Where you told be to go . " <p> " Over an hour ago ! " Martman shrieked . <p> " I was on the subway , " Penelope said while digging through her tote bag to pay Ahmad for her stash of medicinal relief . " I could n't get here eddy faster . Bert would n't let be id his car . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even understand you ! " Martman said . <p> " Sorry . I'b sick again , " Penelope said , sneezing . <p> " Well , just get back here ! We need you in the office now ! " <p> " Okay , " Penelope said , wiping her nose on her jacket sleeve . " But I bay habe to leabe early cuz I do n't feel so well . " <p> " I had five people call out sick . You want Kershank 's job , then you 'll leave when your shift is over ; now get in here ! " Martman hung up . <p> Penelope sighed and dropped the phone from her ear , hanging her head like a sad , sick pink snowman . <p> " Madame Penelope , " Ahmad said from behind the counter , " you do not look so good . You should not be out in this weather . Perhaps you should go home . How is your mother ? " <p> " Thangs . " Penelope sniffled before opening the water bottle and downing the two Tylenol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll fill you in lader , but I hab to go bag to the office now . By boss is a liddle crazy . " <p> " Yes , yes , " Ahmad said , nodding his head . " I could hear him from here . He does not sound like a stable man . You should not listen to him . Every time you come in here he is yelling at you over the phone . " <p> " That 's what eberybody says , " Penelope said , forcing a laugh . She picked up her bag and , swinging it back onto her shoulder , took a deep breath and said somewhat cheerily , " But I 'm gedding a promotion to Manhattan court reporter , so it 's ogay ! " <p> " Oh , congratulations ! " Ahmad said , handing her a small Pakistani flag from the register . " Take this for good luck ! " <p> " Thangs , Ahmad ! " Penelope said , shoving the flag in her pocket , " hab a good day . I 'll still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She opened the door which , when she let go too soon , swung back and hit her with gale force smack in the forehead , but thankfully she was just numb enough not to feel it . <p> Copyright 2009 by Jack &amp; Sophie , Inc . <br> Continues ...
