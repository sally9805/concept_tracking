Many boat owners are intimidated by all things electrical . This undoubtedly prevents mishaps resulting from improperly wired or inadequately protected onboard circuitry . If you do n't understand the electrical system on your boat , it 's wise not to attempt to alter it or add to it . This is especially true of high voltage systems . But owners are often reluctant to make simple fixes  --  such as splicing a broken wire or adding a terminal end . These are straightforward procedures that are easy for any boat owner to master . For this story , electrical engineer Mark Journey , who worked for many years for both Sea Ray and Regal , demonstrated some of the basics . The most important fact to keep in mind , says Journey , is that " each step is very important . There are no shortcuts to solid connections . When you make a crimp connection , you are creating a mechanical weld . Copper is soft enough to fuse to itself under pressure , but the pressure must be adequate to accomplish the job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any water , protecting circuits with breakers and not " tapping off " existing circuits . Marine-Grade Wire : Always use marine-grade wire . Tinned copper is best , although many boat builders use raw copper . Wire should be imprinted , as shown ; size and temperature rating are often included . There is low voltage and high voltage wire . On high voltage wire ( top ) , black is hot , green is ground and white is neutral . Different builders use different color codes for wiring  --  brown for a pump circuit ; blue for a lighting circuit ( blue with white stripes might be used for a certain group of lights ) . The ABYC ( www.abycinc.org ) lists amperage ratings for various wire sizes as well as usage colors-pink for a fuel gauge , orange for an accessory feed , etc . Ancor ( www.ancorproducts.com ) is an excellent source for wire , connectors , terminals , heat shrink tubing , wire ties and tools . Crimpers : The most indispensable tool for making correct connections is a crimp tool or " crimper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Punch-type crimpers ( the two shown on the left ) , are for use on bare metal crimps and should not be used on insulated connectors . Instead , use compression crimpers ( the two on the right ) , because they will not puncture the insulation . The insulated connector on the left was improperly compressed with a punch-type crimper ; the connector on the right was properly compressed with a compression crimper . Some punch-type crimpers ( bottom left ) have an indented section for insulated connectors . The best compression crimpers are " complete cycle " crimpers ( both at right ) , because they require adequate pressure before they will open . Heat Shrink Tubing : Use heat shrink connectors wherever moisture is present . They cost about 10 times as much as non-heat shrink connectors , so builders often opt for the latter . An alternative is to use non-heat shrink connectors plus heat shrink tubing , although heat shrink connectors are preferable . Tubing should always be used over bare metal connectors and terminals . It comes in three types : 2:1 , 3:1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubing will shrink ( 2:1 tubing will shrink to half its diameter ) . You can tell the difference between 2:1 ( top ) and 3:1 or 4:1 ( bottom ) because 3:1 and 4:1 have shiny glue on the inside ; 2:1 does not . Journey uses only 3:1 and 4:1 . Ancor marine-grade tubing has its diameter printed on it . You can use a butane torch or lighter to heat the tubing , but avoid too much heat because insulation can melt . Making a Butt Connection : One of the most common electrical connections boat owners have to make is a butt connection to repair a severed or damaged wire or to splice two wires together . Never use wire nuts or electrical tape to splice wires . Tape can melt . Wire nuts can vibrate loose , and they allow moisture intrusion . Identify the wire size and choose the correct connector . In the photos , the wire is 10 AWG and the corresponding connector is a 12-10 . Connectors and terminals are color coded and marked to match wire size . Red is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For heavier wire connectors , red is 8 AWG ; blue is 6 AWG and yellow is 4 AWG . You can judge the amount of insulation to strip off by holding the wire next to the connector ( photo 1 ) . Here it 's already stripped . The bare wire should fit in the metal tube up to the stop . Strip the wire using a gauged stripper ( 2 ) . Make sure to use the correct hole . Twist the stripped strands tightly together . Hold the connector in the crimper with the metal tube in the jaws and insert the wire , making sure no strands bend back ( 3 ) . Apply the necessary pressure . After crimping both wires in place , apply heat to shrink the connector 's insulation ( 4 ) . Heat Source : A safe , easy way to heat connectors and tubing is with a hot air gun with interchangeable nozzles . The one in the photo is made by Raychem ( www.raychem.com ) . Heat can be applied to connectors in place , or the gun can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common Mistakes : The most common wiring mistakes that Journey sees aboard boats include improperly stripped wires , untwisted wire ends , inadequately crimped connections and poorly supported wires . It 's not uncommon to inadvertently use the wrong hole on a stripping tool and strip away some wire strands along with the insulation . Never use a wire cutter or a knife or razor blade to strip insulation . Make sure adjustable " pistol grip " strippers are correctly adjusted . Always twist wire strands together tightly before inserting them into a connector , and make sure to apply enough pressure when crimping to accomplish a " mechanical weld . " Wire Runs : Here 's an example of neat wiring . When running wires , always leave a " safety loop "  --  a bit of slack incorporated into gradual bends  --  so that some " extra " wire is left to work with if necessary . Secure wire every 10 inches ( the ABYC standard is 18 , but the European CE standard is 10 ) . Use wire ties at least every six inches . Wiring should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement should be eliminated . An excellent way to " junction " wires is to use a terminal barrier strip . In this case , the wires coming to the top are from switches on the dash . Wires from equipment that the switches control will be connected to the bottom row of terminal screws with ring connectors rather than spade connectors . Protectant : There are several moisture-displacing lubricants that will protect electrical connections from corrosion . CRC Heavy Duty Corrosion Inhibitor is the one that Journey uses . He likes it because " you can see that it 's there  --  it leaves a brown film . " Never spray such a product around a flame or where there 's the possibility of a spark , because the mist is flammable . CRC also makes a grease specially formulated for use on marine electronics . CorrosionX and Boeshield T-9 are other excellent moisture-displacing spray lubricants that will help keep corrosion from forming on terminal strips and other connections . The latter leaves a light wax barrier for added protection . Search for Boatkeeper tips by topic at www.motorboating.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
