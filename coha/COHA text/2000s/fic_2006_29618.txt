Pink Jinx By Sandra Hill Warner Vision Sandra Hill Her chips were definitely down .... The scent of salt water always made her sick . Which was really unfortunate for Veronica Jinkowsky , because not only was she being sucked into a venture that would place her on the high seas , but also here she stood on the boardwalk in freakin ' Atlantic City , the saltwater-taffy capital of the world . On a sucky scale of one to ten , her day was hitting about fifteen . And it was not yet over . The rhythmic click of her high-heeled Christian Louboutin pumps on the boardwalk planks vibrated throughout her body and up to her head , which , not surprisingly , throbbed with a killer headache . Swinging through the back beachside door into the Taj Mahal , she blinked against the assault of cigarette smoke , raucous music , flashing lights , and the ching-ching-ching of slot machines . It was midnight , and the gamblers were out in full force . In the midst of all this " splendor , " she stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . Distracted , Veronica bumped into a short , elderly woman with red curly hair carrying a purse the size of Idaho . The jolt forced the woman against a slot machine , which began to make loud noises : " Wheel ... of ... Fortune . Wheel ... of ... Fortune ... " Yikes ! At first , Veronica was alarmed . The woman , a combination ofSophia Petrillo from The Golden Girls and Granny Clampett from The Beverly Hillbillies , had to be at least seventy years old . That 's all she needed-to knock down some old lady in a casino . But the old lady righted herself and asked in a heavy Southern accent , " You gots any idea where the Chippenduds is dancin ' ? " She was so short she had to crane her neck to peer up at Veronica . Huh ? Ohmigod , she must think I work here . Then the old lady asked , " Are you a hooker ? " " I beg your pardon ! Why would you ask such an absurd question ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of my best friends is hookers down on Bourbon Street . Well , okay , one of them was ... back in 1952 . Marie Boudreaux , bless her heart . Anyhow , you look like yer high class , and I heard they has lotsa hookers here in Atlantic City , and I figgered you mus ' be one them call gals or sumpin ' . You know , high-priced ladies of the night . Ai n't you ever seen that Elizabeth Taylor movie Butterfield 8 ? " Veronica clicked her jaw shut . She had n't realized she 'd been gaping . Me ? A hooker ? Is she blind as well as batty ? Veronica refused to answer such a ridiculous question . " Back to your question-your other question . I 've never heard of Chippendudes . Do you mean Chippendales ? " The lady furrowed her already-wrinkled brow . In fact , she had so many wrinkles she could probably screw a hat on . " No . They 's definitely dudes , not dales . " Veronica had to smile , despite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Tsk-tsk-tsk ! Do I look like I could do anything with a nekkid boy toy ? " Not in a million years was Veronica going to answer that question . " Now , Richard Simmons , thass another story . Hubba-hubba , that boy is ten kinds of sexy ! Betcha he 's got a real nice hiney . Betcha it 's an onion butt . My niece Charmaine says an onion butt is a butt that 's so nice it brings tears to yer eyes . " Good grief ! " Nope . I come all the way from Looz-ee-anna to rescue my great-nephew . He jist grad-je-ated from college and got hisself a summer job flashing his bee-hind in front of a bunch of horny wimmen . Talk about ! " Oh , boy ! Leave it to me to find myself a looney bird after only five minutes in a casino . Why me ? " Sorry . I do n't know where there are any male strip shows . You might try asking at the front desk . " " The rascal 's prob'ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n hog spit . But I 'll find him , guaranteed . " " I 've got to be going . " Veronica backed away . But her innate sense of kindness would n't let her abandon the woman , who was clearly lost or , worse , stranded here . " Are you alone ? " Please , God , do n't let her be . I ca n't solve my own problems , let alone someone else 's . " I came with Henri Pinot . He said he 'd be back quicker ' n a gator kin blink . That means in a minute . Henri is my third cousin . A widower . But his dead wife , Margie , talks to ' im all the time . Margie was a voodoo priestess . Henri went to the restroom . Between you and me , he has a little prostate trouble . " Way more information than I need . Time to make a getaway . " Uh , nice meeting you . Good luck . " Granny Clampett had already turned around and was putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She felt a little guilty leaving the aged damsel in distress , but Veronica was a woman on a mission herself . And she damn well wanted to get it over with as soon as possible . Wending her way through the casino-past a city of slot machines and roulette , craps , and blackjack tables , she finally arrived at the poker room in the front of the hotel . A banner proclaimed , " U.S. Poker Championship . " A poster read , " No-Limit Texas Hold ' Em ... $1 million Grand Prize . " ESPN camera crews were there filming , and somewhere in the background , probably coming from another part of the casino , she heard that catchy country song by the duo Big and Rich . Coincidentally , the rowdy song was the lead-in to some of ESPN 's TV poker programs . Something about a guy who walks into the room , passing out hundred-dollar bills , buying the whole room a double round of Crown , and " it kills and it chills .... " She shook her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cordoned off by velvet ropes from the finalists ' table about fifteen feet away . Six players were still in the game with piles of chips in front of each of them . The tour director was calling out the action : " Sabato bets ... " " Molene raises ... " " Here comes the river ... " She did n't recognize the middle-aged guy in the cowboy hat or the young Vietnamese fellow , but she did know the others . Grace O'Brien was a cynical ex-nun . Correction-a cynical ex-nun with a sense of humor . The first time Veronica had met her , four years ago , Grace had cracked a joke : " What do you call a one-legged nun ? Hopalong Chastity . " Veronica had been to Grace 's Cape May cottage several times and liked her a lot . Mark Molene was a Denver oncologist who 'd given up his high-stress medical practice a couple years back . Mark was dark and a little scary , giving new meaning to the word unsociable . And Angel Sabato . Veronica had to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for his collection of Harleys-and Harley groupies . She recalled a harrowing trip she 'd taken with him one time down the Garden State Parkway . Angel , not surprisingly , had posed for Playgirl last year . His photos had appeared below the suggestive headline , " His Poker Is Hot . " She would n't admit it to just anyone , but Veronica had checked out the issue-only because she 'd wanted to see if he really did have piercings in his penis , as had been rumored . He did . And , yep , it was hot . Then there was the last player . You could say that she was acquainted with him . Well acquainted . He was her ex-husband , Jake Jensen . Actually , he was her fourth ex-husband . Okay , he was her only ex-husband . They had married and divorced four times , each of the marriages ending in a standoff and Jake ultimately leaving . Trying to have a sense of humor about their multiple weddings-it was either laugh or cry-she and Jake had given names to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been so much in love it practically leaked from their pores . They 'd foolishly thought love conquered all . The wedding had involved a church service and a lavish reception , despite her grandmother 's disapproval of Jake . The marriage had lasted a record three years . Next had come the Cowboy Marriage . Hey , what woman could resist a guy in Aruba wearing cowboy boots , a cowboy hat , and the sexiest grin this side of the Texas panhandle ? All she knew was that she 'd somehow landed in the honeymoon suite of a local hotel with Jake , him wearing nothing but cowboy boots and an open snap-button shirt and her wearing nothing . Whew ! She got shivers just thinking about that one . Too bad it had ended two years later . Third came the Tequila Marriage . Think Mexico and a gallon of tequila . Enough said ! One year for that mistake . Fourth was the Insanity Marriage . They had actually gone into that one with their eyes wide open . No heated rush . No booze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . That marriage went out with a roar in a pitiful three months . Thus , four marriages and divorces . It was embarrassing , really . She was a corporate lawyer , albeit a burned-out , bored one . Presumably intelligent . She was sensible to the max . And yet she did n't have the sense to stop marrying and divorcing the same guy over and over . She continued to watch Jake as he played . Some people thought he looked like a leaner , younger George Clooney . She thought he looked better . The years gave her cellulite ; they gave Jake charisma . Her heart skipped a beat then hammered against her chest , making her breathless . That was the reaction she always had on first seeing her sinfully handsome ex . You 'd think the hair-trigger attraction would have faded in the two years since she 'd seen him last . Not that any of that mattered . Veronica shook her head to clear it of the unwelcome temptation . He was thirty-five years old , wore a baseball cap over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on his lucky gray T-shirt with the logo " Up that ! " She 'd bought it for him sometime during the Tequila Marriage . Dark sunglasses covered his compelling , pale blue eyes . " How much are each of those chips worth ? " she asked the elderly gentleman next to her . " This is the cadillac of poker tournaments , so ... Let me see , the orange ones are one thousand each . Gray ones , five thousand each . Buy-in fee was ten thousand dollars . " " Holy moly ! " Stacked in front of Jake was about-she did a rough mental calculation-four hundred thousand dollars . He sure had come up in the world , if gambling one 's life away could be considered an achievement . There was an old Armenian saying : " What the wind brings , the wind blows away . " She and Jake had been in more windstorms than she could count . She must have spoken louder than she 'd thought because Jake 's head shot up and turned right to her . He lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a better view of her . Then a slow grin crept across his lips , just before he slid the glasses back up . Instantly , he morphed into his zen mode , something he 'd perfected over the years . Focus , focus , focus-that 's what was needed to be a winning poker player in the Bible According to Jake . He gave away no " tells " once he was in that mode-not a blink , grimace , or gesture , nothing to indicate whether he held a winning or losing hand . Everyone at the table seemed tense . She knew from living with Jake that in no-limit Texas hold ' em , fortunes could change from hand to hand . Some pros refused to enter this kind of game because of the heart-stopping swings . The three flop cards were already on the table . As spectators looked on , the dealer flipped the turn card , which left only Jake , Mark , and the Vietnamese guy in the hand . Mark bet $400,000 , enough to put Jake and the Vietnamese player all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called and was disgusted to see that he was " drawing dead . " As the meaningless river card hit the felt , Mark scooped up his winnings , and the tournament clock hit zero , indicating the end of the level and a short break for the remaining players . Jake immediately made his way toward her , which she 'd expected . He knew she would n't step foot into a casino , or come searching for him after all this time , unless it was important . People kept patting him on the back and shaking his hand , but he merely nodded at them and continued on his way . Even the ESPN reporter was waved off . When he got to her , he took her elbow and steered her down a side corridor labeled " Employees Only . " Not a word did he utter . But then she was a bit speechless herself . He stopped and stuck one hand into his jeans pocket , something he did reflexively when he was nervous . No one but she knew that he was probably fingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sappy Marriage . Or was it the Cowboy one ? Taking off his sunglasses , he leaned his left shoulder against the wall . " Hey , Ronnie , " he greeted her in that low , husky voice that made her melt . Had made her melt at one time , she amended . " Jake , " she said back , matching his husky voice . It was a greeting routine they had played often in the past . To her surprise , he did n't appear pleased . " What 's up ? " he asked with equal measures of irritation and concern . She leaned her right shoulder against the wall , facing him . Forget old feelings of tenderness ... or lust . She was angry once again . " My grandfather , " she snapped . He arched both eyebrows . " Frank ? " " Yeah , Frank . " Veronica had called her grandfather Frank from the time she was only a few years old . Grandpa or Gramps was too soft for the man , even then . " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold toilets ? " Her grandfather owned a treasure-hunting company , Jinx , Inc. , a play on his last name , Jinkowsky . A treasure detective , that 's what he called himself . Sort of like Clive Cussler 's Dirk Pitt , she supposed . Sometimes his projects involved deep-sea expeditions , sometimes archaeological digs , and sometimes just tracking down mysterious , missing objects . While he supposedly had a great reputation among historians , scholars , and museum curators for having made some important discoveries , he was known to take on infamous cases as well . Last year , he recovered a solid-gold toilet once owned by Mussolini . Some Italian prince paid a million dollars for the stupid thing . The story made all the newspapers . Frank had been quoted as saying something about even Mussolini needing a crapper and other unsavory observations . Her Boston family was not amused . Veronica refused to play teasing games with Jake , though . This was business . Serious business . " He signed Jinx , Inc. , over to me . " Jake 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're kidding ! " She had his attention now . " But not only the treasure-hunting company . He 's given me his boat , Sweet Jinx ; the Barnegat warehouse ; his Long Beach Island house ; and a bunch of his personal belongings . Without my permission , by the way . " Veronica had become increasingly dissatisfied with her job as a corporate lawyer this past year . But that did n't mean she wanted to , or would ever , become a treasure hunter , for Pete 's sake . That would be like Donald Trump deciding to become a hula dancer . No , it was the field of corporate law that no longer appealed to her , not the law itself . Jake was clearly startled by her news , but he remained silent , waiting for her to explain . Talking to Jake was like playing a game of cards-she never knew what he was thinking , unless he wanted her to . Jake laughed . " You ? Running a treasure-hunting company ? Last time I talked to Frank , he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hell 's bells , Ronnie , you get seasick in the bathtub . " He was still laughing . " It 's not funny . I have a job in Boston . A steady job , " she added for his benefit . " I have no time for this nonsense . " Jake did n't rise to her " steady job " bait . He 'd heard it enough in the past . " So ? Decline all the ... gifts . " " I ca n't . His lawyer says the trust he 's set up is ironclad . I just came from Harley Winston 's office in Asbury Park . " Jake 's eyes swept over her . " So that 's why you 're all dolled up . " She felt herself blush , though she had n't a clue why . Jake had said and done much more to make her blush over the years . " I went to a charity event for my grandmother in Spring Lake before I met with the lawyer . " He nodded , his face suddenly grim . Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . If he only knew how her grandmother had flipped when Veronica had told her where she was going tonight ! " Can Frank do that-give you something you do n't want ? Is n't it illegal or something ? Oh . Forget I said that . " ( Continues ... ) by Sandra Hill
