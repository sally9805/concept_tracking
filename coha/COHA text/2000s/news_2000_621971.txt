<p> YOU 'D LIKE to find a spot for Home Run Baker , but third base is jammed . You wish Mark McGwire had stayed around a bit longer . You ca n't find a spot for Jose Canseco or Joe Rudi , but you honor the great Jimmy Foxx . And nobody beats the Eck  --  not even Rollie . <p> The A 's are a four-dynasty organization , and not many can say that . Whether it 's turn-of-the-century ball , the sluggin ' 1930s , the revolutionary ' 70s or the corporate late ' 80s , the A 's have powerhouse history to spare . That 's why the voting for their All-Century team has sparked such interest among historians of the game . <p> We were fortunate enough to get a ballot on the media committee , which will count 60 percent against the fans ' 40 percent in determining the team . Some of the decisions were a rock-solid cinch , like Campy Campaneris at shortstop , Mickey Cochrane catching , Eddie Collins at second base ( while longing for those Dick Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vida Blue , Catfish Hunter and Dave Stewart . <p> Rudi might have played the purest left field you 've ever seen , but you have to honor the greatest leadoff man in history , Rickey Henderson . We 'll play Al Simmons in center , a bit out of position for him ( use Rick Monday or Dwayne Murphy for late-inning defense ) but fully necessary ; Simmons hit .334 over 20 years with 100-plus RBIs in his first 11 seasons . And we 'll take Reggie Jackson over Canseco in right . Time does n't cloud the fact that Reggie , in any uniform , was one of the greatest clutch performers in history . <p> McGwire was going to have enough trouble with Foxx , who racked up 534 career homers and three seasons with at least 160 RBIs , but the big man 's departure to St. Louis sealed the deal . Third base has the fabled Baker , Jimmy Dykes and Carney Lansford , but we 'll take the massive , reliable presence of Sal Bando over there . <p> The rotation leaves out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie Plank and Kenny Holtzman , but the toughest choice is Dennis Eckersley over Rollie Fingers as the clo-ser . You ca n't really lose either way . Eck just had too much style  --  and he walked , like , two guys a season . <p> The ballot asks for an all-time manager , and among the many worthy candidates , you ca n't knock the incredible 50-year run of Connie Mack ( all with the A 's ) and his nine World Series appearances . Foxx is our player of the century , and even though the late- ' 80s teams only won one World Series , that ' 89 team gets our vote for the century 's best . <p> So think about Billy Martin and Shooty Babitt when you fill out your ballot . Remember Mitchell Page and the year Dick Allen wore " Wampum 60 " on the back of his uniform . Remember the ' 72 boys winning it all without Reggie , and the fearsome gusts of wind stirred up by Dave Kingman 's swing . A lot of franchises do the all-century thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3-DOT STEW <p> John Elway 's retirement felt like champagne . Dan Marino 's felt more like Alka-Seltzer . The long , depressing slide is over , and we can start celebrating a career for the history books . . . The playoffs of Marino 's second season summed it up well . He was pure revelation in the AFC title game , dismantling the great Pittsburgh Steelers with a performance that bordered on the unbelievable . Then he ran into a better team , and a better quarterback , and the 49ers walked off with the trophy . . . Good show by Marino , bringing up Joe Namath 's name in the category of Quickest Release . Nobody tops Marino over a long period of time , but Namath was the master in his prime . Check out any NFL Films package on Namath and watch one play in particular , a 50-yard rocket against against the Kansas City Chiefs that hits Don Maynard in stride . That 's our vote for the sweetest pass ever thrown . . . As usual , Dusty Baker was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing out , in disgust , that Rocker is a " hero " in many parts of the country . You have to love Florida , where they put down their ammo and gave him a standing O . . . Looking for some of that old 1950s feel ? Buy a pack of the new Fleer Tradition baseball cards . Check the back of the cards , especially ; you can almost taste that flat slab of bubble gum . . . Highly recommended : " The Giants Encyclopedia " ( Sports Publishing , Inc. ) by Tom Schott and respected beat writer Nick Peters , who covered his first game in 1961 . Every player , every trade , every event of significance is there . . . Saturday nostalgia : Tim Keown , whose " Making a List " column had a huge following before he left The Chronicle , has revived it on the Internet for espn.com . . . Bob Costas wondered aloud ( on NBC ) if creaky Tim Hardaway should give up his Olympic roster spot to Vince Carter , and Tim got pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Gugliotta is out with an injury . It 's Kobe Bryant who should replace Hardaway . Or just about anyone else on that tired-looking outfit . . . So thousands of college players wish they could get a crack at the NCAA Tournament , and a lot of deserving teams got the ax , and here 's Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins whining about his seed . Really weak . Play the game you 've drawn , then move on . . . Best part of Gonzaga 's first-round win : It knocked Denny Crum 's tie out of the tournament . . . Ludicrous timing : The NCAA title game is on Monday , April 3  --  Opening Night of the baseball season ( save Cubs-Mets in Japan ) . There has to be a better way . . . One of the gems we got from the Knicks ' Jeff Van Gundy before the mikes-in-the-huddle idea disappeared : " We 've got to play ! We 're not playing ! " Riveting stuff . . . Listen , as much as we defend Bobby Knight , we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player . But the real losers in this deal are the accusers , widely ridiculed by Knight 's current players , and some devious minds at CNN/SI , who worked forever on the project but blatantly aired it now  --  just in time to give Indiana one hell of a distraction . . . What 's the big news here ? Knight has a violent streak . You play for him , it 's like joining the Marines . If you 're tough enough to handle it , you 'll become a winning athlete with a college degree . . . Knight is a throwback , and do n't take that lightly . In one of our interviews for the Pete Newell biography , Pete mentioned a game he coached for the 1949-50 USF team against Long Island , coached by the legendary Clair Bee . At one point , in his disgust with a lackluster stretch of play , Bee slapped all five of his players  --  hard , right in the face  --  as they came off the court . In plain view of everyone . . . Baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 2003 All-Star Game . Deep down , he had to acknowledge the horror of it all : The new Comiskey is by far the worst of the new ballparks and a disgrace in Chicago , where they fondly remember the old Comiskey as the real thing . . . Just wondering out loud here , but we 'd love to see Darren Lewis back in a Giants uniform . His effortless defense would be a godsend at Pac Bell Park ( " He 's still one of the five best outfielders in our league , " says Red Sox teammate Mike Stanley ) , and Baker named his son , now a year old , after Lewis . . . The Yanks pulled the obvious move when they canned Jeff Juden after his last outing ( get this : one inning , five runs , a bases-loaded walk to the pitcher , two hit batters with the bases loaded , and a wild pitch behind Jason Kendall 's head ) . But that 's vintage Juden . That 's his life in a nutshell . How could they even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Giants had a golden chance to change mascots for the millennium , but they came right back with that " seal " that looks like a rat . Overheard from a field-level spectator at Scottsdale Stadium : " Move along , ya rodent ! The game 's on ! " <p> Bruce Jenkins can be reached via e-mail at jenks@sfgate.com.
