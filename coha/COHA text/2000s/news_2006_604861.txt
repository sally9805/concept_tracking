<p> In the hours before that fateful Daytona 500 five years ago , the face of NASCAR 's premier circuit was Dale Earnhardt . Wherever Earnhardt wandered in the pits , competitors gravitated to the charismatic legend with the mustache and wraparound sunglasses . They soaked in every ounce of wisdom from the driver Bill France Jr . said was NASCAR 's greatest ever . <p> When Earnhardt strode across the stage in prerace introductions Feb.18 , 2001 , his imposing 6-1 frame drew the largest cheer . <p> It might have marked the end of the one-man show in stock car racing . <p> " I do n't see any one person that everyone migrates to in this sport anymore , " says Jeff Burton , who drives for Richard Childress Racing , Earnhardt 's former team . " When you have an opportunity to pick the mind of a seven-time champion , that 's a special thing . " <p> And yet five years after losing its biggest name on the final lap of its most famous race , NASCAR is enjoying record TV ratings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a marketable lineup of star drivers from Generations X and Y. <p> The sport has swapped title sponsors , replaced chairman France with his son Brian and radically altered its championship format since Earnhardt 's death . <p> What the Nextel Cup Series lacks is an icon as powerful and transcendent as Earnhardt , who was compared by NASCAR 's movers and shakers to Elvis Presley , James Dean , John Wayne , Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan . <p> " I 've seen no one become the spokesperson for the driver brigade as Dale Earnhardt was week in and week out , " says Larry McReynolds , a former Earnhardt crew chief and now a TV analyst on Speed Channel and Fox . <p> " I do n't know that we ever will have anybody that will fill those shoes . " <p> There seems a consensus that a triumvirate of drivers shares the burden Earnhardt once shouldered largely by himself . <p> *Dale Earnhardt Jr. , 31 , has inherited the bulk of his father 's popularity ( XM Satellite Radio has given him a weekly radio show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the millions of units . <p> *Jeff Gordon , 34 , has capitalized on his movie-star looks and silky smooth image to form alliances with Madison Avenue ( as a high-end corporate pitchman ) and Hollywood ( as a TV show host ) that even the financially savvy Earnhardt might not have thought possible . <p> *Reigning champion Tony Stewart , 34 , has honed an edgy desire to win into the closest approximation of Earnhardt 's at-track persona , unafraid to challenge NASCAR as a sharp-tongued but respected critic . <p> Earnhardt Jr. , Gordon and Stewart are in heavy rotation in the NASCAR marketing machine , which also has hummed along by promoting photogenic up-and-comers such as Jimmie Johnson , 30 , and Kasey Kahne , 25 . <p> " I do n't think any one person has stepped up to fill that vacuum left by Earnhardt , nor do I think NASCAR necessarily wants someone to , " says David Carter , principal of The Sports Business Group , a Los Angeles-based sports consulting firm . " Having numerous drivers step up to the plate helps NASCAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal cut across sport <p> Carter believes NASCAR 's first network TV deal , in 2001 , and the spread of racetracks to major markets such as Chicago , Los Angeles , Kansas City , Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami have dispersed stardom across the series by widening its audience . The expanding multimedia landscape diluted the opportunity for a personality as dominant as Earnhardt , whose North Carolina roots appealed to the Southern core of NASCAR 's traditionalist fan base . <p> " So many other drivers can get out there and communicate their personalities through the Speed Channel , ESPN and corporate hospitality , " Carter says . " There 's a lot more outlets for people to get to know and form opinions about drivers . " <p> According to Joe Mattes , vice president of e-commerce at Turner Sports , Earnhardt Jr. , Gordon and Stewart rank as the top three in sales at NASCAR.com . Earnhardt remains a top-10 seller , but Mattes said the revenue is spread more evenly than 10 years ago , when there was a drop-off in demand beyond the late superstar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cashing in on his name and licensing his " Intimidator " image into a million-dollar moneymaker . That business acumen , plus a record-tying seven championships that no longer seem possible in this era of parity , catapulted him from regional folk hero to a pop culture status replete with movie cameos and invitations to the National Press Club . <p> " You have those people in sports and entertainment that seem to go above and beyond what anyone else can do , " driver Dale Jarrett says . " You had Michael Jordan in the NBA , Elvis in rock music and Dale Earnhardt here . Right now we do n't have that person . <p> " Junior does a great job of carrying the sport as far as fan popularity and in the race car , but he 's not that person his dad was as far as going to NASCAR and seeing what was best for the sport . " <p> Through wealth , fame and success , Earnhardt gained enormous cachet with NASCAR 's power brokers . <p> President Mike Helton was a frequent recipient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips to the Bahamas with France Jr . and never hesitated to march into the sanctioning body 's trailer to demand changes in rules or criticize policy . <p> " He had NASCAR 's ear from the top down , and the other competitors knew that , " NASCAR spokesman Jim Hunter says . " They 'd go to Earnhardt and say , ' Why do n't you talk to them about this ? ' Because everyone knew NASCAR would listen to him . " <p> Says McReynolds : " The big joke was , if it was raining and you saw Earnhardt in street clothes or headed toward his motor coach , you knew the race was called . I 'm not saying they made all their decisions based on what he would tell them , but when he spoke , they listened . " <p> Other drivers , particularly rookies , hung on Earnhardt 's every word . Elliott Sadler entered the circuit in 1999 and was among the last rookie classes to be schooled by Earnhardt . <p> Sadler says NASCAR has been invaded by a 21st-century wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of ' I 'm the new savior of the sport ' because they have n't had that talk we all had . " <p> " Dale would sit us down , tell us how you 're supposed to race , how you treat your sponsors and how you do things , " Sadler says . <p> " We do n't have that stature figure anymore for young kids to look up to . <p> " It 'd be neat to have another Dale Earnhardt step up and be the voice of all the drivers in the garage , but right now we do n't have that . " <p> Media-conscious is the route now <p> Gordon and Stewart seem the logical successors to inheriting the mantle of larger-than-life garage boss . <p> Earnhardt 's clout increased with success ; no active drivers can approach the recent numbers of Gordon and Stewart . Gordon has four championships and 73 victories  --  three from tying Earnhardt for sixth on the career list . <p> Stewart has captured two titles in the last four seasons . <p> Both have been outspoken on hot-button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impassioned plea for NASCAR to halt aggressive driving at Daytona or else " we 're going to kill someone . " <p> Gordon has n't been shy about hammering NASCAR on safety upgrades and sponsorship conflicts . <p> Like Earnhardt , who was nicknamed " Ironhead " for his stubbornness and willingness to wreck even a friend if it meant winning , Stewart and Gordon seem impervious to booing . <p> " Earnhardt was the type of person who could be hated and loved , " says Jimmy Spencer , who drove the Cup circuit from 1989 to 2005 and now is an analyst for Speed . " All the drivers today are trying to be loved and want to say the right things for the media and sponsors . " <p> If Gordon is n't overly conscientious about being universally adored , he also is n't consumed with becoming the focal point every Sunday morning . <p> " The more years I 'm in this sport , the more respect I earn , " he says . " I 'm not asking for guys to come and bounce things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly going to give my opinion . I 'm not going to hold back . " <p> He learned that from listening to Earnhardt . " I miss the heck out of him , " Gordon says . <p> " He was a great inspiration and somebody I always felt like I could go to , and I do n't know if I have that go-to guy now . I do n't think his presence will be replaced . " Top sales <p> Five years after his death , Dale Earnhardt remains one of the top sellers in NASCAR merchandise .
