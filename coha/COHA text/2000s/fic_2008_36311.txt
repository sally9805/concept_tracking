Your sister is on the phone , " Jeremy said as Ava approached his desk and snagged a Hershey 's Kiss out of his candy dish . Jeremy was a perfectly good assistant in other ways , but his endless supply of chocolates made him an indispensable one , in Ava 's opinion . <p> Ava looked at her watch . " She wants to talk now ? " <p> " Should I tell her you 'll call back ? " he asked . Jeremy had sweet big brown eyes and thick , tousled hair . There was something slightly babyish about his round chin and full lips that made Ava feel mildly maternal toward him , though he was only a few years younger than her . <p> " No , it 's all right . I 'll take it . " Ava went into her office , shut the door , and punched the speaker button on her phone . <p> " Transferring , " Jeremy 's voice said , and then there was a beep and Lauren 's voice came out of the speaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep . Just got here . " She shrugged off her coat . <p> " Really ? So late ? " Lauren 's voice had the breathy quality of a young girl , but she lingered on her s 's in a way that was oddly sultry . The combination suited her : in person she managed to be simultaneously childlike and alluring , with wildly curly dark hair , big eyes , a pointed chin , and a small , curvy figure . <p> In theory , she and Ava resembled each other-they were both small and dark-haired and anyone could immediately identify them as siblings-but Ava , whose hair was straight and who knew herself to be neither childlike nor alluring , did n't see it at all . <p> " It 's nine a.m. , " Ava said . She hoisted her heavy briefcase onto her desk . " Three-hour time difference-remember ? " She extracted her laptop and a few folders , which she arranged in a neat pile on her desk , squaring the corners . <p> " Yeah , I know . I just figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office by six . Hey , A ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " How seriously do you have to take letters from a collection agency ? " <p> Ava digested that for a moment and then the weight of it made her sink into her desk chair . " You want to start at the beginning ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> A pause . " Okay , then it depends a little on how many you 've gotten and how much time has passed since the initial notice , but ... I 'd certainly take them pretty seriously . Who 's sending you the letters ? " <p> " Who is n't ? " Lauren said with a little laugh . " I 'm up to my ass in debt , Ava . No , deeper . Up to my ears . " <p> " Why ? " Ava said . " I mean , you rent your apartment , you have a job , you do n't have kids- " <p> " My job is the problem , " Lauren said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the boutique without seeing things I want for myself . " <p> " Wanting something and having to own it are two different things . " <p> " Not for me . " <p> " Well , that explains why you 're up to your earholes in debt , " Ava said . " So do you need me to lend you some money ? " <p> " No , no , " Lauren said . " I do n't want your money . Unless , you know ... you feel like you want to- " She cut herself off . " No , really , I do n't . But I thought maybe if you wrote some of these debt collectors-you know , on your letterhead-maybe used some legalese , sounded official- " <p> " And tell them what exactly ? " Ava said . " That you 're above the law and should n't have to pay money you owe ? " <p> " Would that work ? " said Lauren with a hopeful little laugh . <p> " You need to talk to a debt counselor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your debts , and set up a payment schedule for you . Do you want me to get some names for you ? " <p> " Would I still have to pay it all back ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " What about declaring bankruptcy ? Do n't people do that all the time ? " <p> " It 's a morally corrupt way to avoid accountability , " Ava said seriously . <p> Another little laugh . " But besides that- " <p> " It should only ever be a last resort , " Ava said . She stood up , which made her notice a small stain at the bottom of her sweater that had n't been visible in the mirror of her badly lit bedroom that morning . " I 'll e-mail you about the debt counselors as soon as I get some references . In the meantime , cancel all your credit cards and stop buying stuff . Make yourself a strict budget and stick to it . And if you ca n't stand being around beautiful , expensive things , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop buying stuff ? " <p> " I get it , " Lauren said . " How are you doing ? " <p> " Fine , " Ava said . " I got my TiVo fixed . " <p> " Woo-hoo . It 's an exciting life you lead . " <p> There was a knock on the office door and Ava walked over and opened it . " It had been broken for a while , " she said , raising her voice so Lauren could still hear her . " I was missing all my favorite shows . " Jeremy was waiting outside the door , a steaming cup of coffee in his hand . She mouthed her thanks as she took the cup , then said out loud , " I need to get to work , Lauren . " <p> " Yeah , okay , " Lauren said . " Bye . Oh , wait-one last question . I almost forgot . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Hypothetically ... A landlord ca n't just suddenly evict you for not paying your rent , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lauren 's boss had asked her to cover the boutique that afternoon . Normally Lauren was the one who went to trunk shows and designer showrooms while her boss manned the store , but Saralyn had promised a friend with a new handbag line that she would check it out herself . Lauren did n't mind . She liked working with customers . She knew what looked good on people and enjoyed creating outfits for them . And once she had put them in something really spectacular , she was often inspired to try on something similar , so she frequently ended a day in the store with a bag of her own purchases-bought , of course , with her employee discount . <p> It was a fairly slow weekday , and after she had helped a preteen and her mother find something they could agree on for the girl 's first middle school dance-the girl wanted it to look sexy , the mother did n't , and Lauren got them to compromise on a tube dress that was form-hugging but did n't actually reveal anything-she was all alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably about twenty-eight , in good shape , and wearing a blue wool suit and a dark red tie . He could have wandered in from any of the financial or legal offices that surrounded their downtown store . She was n't crazy about his goatee , but it did n't matter : any guy who came into their store was taken , or he would n't be shopping there . <p> " Hi there , " she said , looking up from the sweaters she was refolding and stacking . " How are you doing ? " <p> " Great . " He studied her briefly . Lauren was wearing a very short skirt with go-go boots and a tight heather-brown cropped sweater that was much shorter than the crimson tissue tee she wore underneath . " I have a feeling you 'll be a big help , " he said with a pleasant nod . " You 're so stylish . I need a present for my girlfriend . " <p> " What 's the occasion ? " <p> " Birthday , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lauren said . " You sure put it off till the last minute , did n't you ? " <p> " I kind of forgot . " He gave a sheepish smile . " She had to remind me this morning . " <p> " Ouch , " she said . " That 's why BirthdayAlarm-dot-com was invented , you know . " <p> He held out his hands in a gesture of supplication . " So long as I get it in before midnight , I 'm okay , right ? " <p> " Do n't worry-we 'll find her something fantastic . Did you have anything in mind ? " <p> He indicated her outfit . " How about that sweater you 're wearing ? I would n't mind seeing her in that . " <p> She adjusted the sweater slightly . It was one of her favorites . For that month . But she had n't bought it at the boutique . " You sure you do n't want to go with jewelry ? You do n't have to worry about size and everyone loves to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Let me show you what we 've got . " She circled around behind the jewelry counter , which was also the cash register stand , and sorted through the necklaces hanging on the wooden display tree . She slid a long silver link chain off a branch and held it up . " This is really popular right now . It 's extra-long , but it can be doubled up if she wants to wear it choker-length . I bought one myself a couple of weeks ago . " <p> " How much ? " he said . <p> She squinted at the tag . " A hundred and twenty-nine dollars . " <p> He gave a low whistle . " That 's a little more than I was hoping to spend . " <p> That was actually fairly inexpensive for their store . " Okay , " Lauren said , slipping the necklace back into place . " We 'll find something else . " She poked through the other necklaces , checking the price tags , and then pounced on one that was less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone hanging from a delicate silver chain . It was n't exciting but it was completely unobjectionable . <p> She slid the necklace off the post and laid the stone across the palm of her hand . " This is it , " she said . " This is the one you want . " Men shopping for gifts liked to be led to a decision-that much she had learned from her years of selling to them . <p> " It 's pretty , " he said obediently . " How much ? " <p> " Eighty-nine . " <p> " You know what would help ? " he said . " If you put it on . So I could see what it looks like . Would you mind ? " <p> " Not at all , " Lauren said , but the clasp was a tricky one and the little hook kept slipping out of the link . <p> The guy said , " Let me help , " so she handed the necklace to him and gathered her long hair in one hand to bare her neck as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter that was between them and strung the chain out above her chest , then brought it around to the nape of her neck . His fi ngers brushed against her skin-possibly more than was necessary , but she was n't sure and decided to ignore it . <p> Once it was fastened , she turned again with a bright smile , letting her hair drop back into place . She touched the necklace to reassure herself that the stone hit just below the hollow at the base of her neck . " There , " she said . " How beautiful is that ? If you do n't buy it for your girlfriend , I might have to buy it for myself . And I ca n't afford to go around buying myself any more jewelry , so you 'd better take it . " <p> " It looks great , " he said . " But I 'm not sure the necklace can take the credit . I bet everything looks good on you . " <p> " Hardly . " She reached up behind her neck again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to fasten it . " Shall I wrap it ? " <p> " It 's a go , " he said with a nod . <p> While she was tying a ribbon around the box , another customer walked in . Lauren looked up and said , " Hi-be right with you , " and the woman said " Take your time " and wandered over to the sweaters . <p> " There you are ! " Lauren said , slipping the box into a bag and handing it to the guy . " I hope she enjoys it . " <p> " Me too , " he said and took the box out of the bag and held it out to her . Lauren stared at it uncomprehendingly . Then he said , " It 's for you . " <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " It looked so good on you , " he said . " I think you should have it . " <p> " You 're so funny , " Lauren said , trying to pass it off as a joke , give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one thing-it was practically in her job description-but the flirting was supposed to end as soon as the charge was approved . <p> Apparently he had n't read the rulebook . " No , really . Take it . " He put the box on the counter between them and pushed it toward her . <p> " I ca n't . " She folded her arms . " Take it home and give it to your girlfriend . She 's going to love it . " <p> " If you 're not comfortable taking a gift from a stranger , then give me a chance to get to know you . Have dinner with me tonight . " <p> " I doubt there 'll be enough birthday cake for all three of us , " Lauren said . " That 's not what I meant- " <p> " I know . " She gave the box a backhanded slap . It flew across the counter and the guy had to make a dive for it before it hit the floor . She took advantage of the moment to escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had some question about hat sizes . <p> The guy lingered for a little while longer , trying to catch her eye , but she pointedly ignored him , and eventually he gave up and left , carrying the little box with him . <p> At least his girlfriend would get a pretty necklace , Lauren thought , though she suspected it might get thrown back in his face sometime in the not too distant future . <p> * * * <p> A few weeks later , Ava returned to her office from a meeting to find that her father had sent her and Lauren a joint e-mail . The subject line said , " Serious news . " <p> The entire body of the e-mail read " Your mother has cancer . Call home . " <p> " Oh my God , " she said out loud and grabbed the phone . Her parents ' line was busy : her father refused to get call waiting because he thought clicking over to a new call was disrespectful to the original caller . <p> She kept trying , dialing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the line stayed busy . After a few minutes of this , Jeremy buzzed in to tell her that she had a call . <p> It was Lauren , who did n't bother to greet her , just said , " Have you spoken to Mom and Dad yet ? " <p> " Not yet . I was in a meeting and only just got Dad 's e-mail . My God , Lauren , Mom ... " <p> " I know , I was freaking out , too , but it 's okay . " The normalness of Lauren 's voice was the most reassuring thing Ava had ever heard . " I ca n't believe Dad told us like that . The man is insane . Mom 's fine , Ava . They just found a few cancer cells in one of her breasts-I mean , literally , we 're talking a few cells . They 'll blast them with some mild chemotherapy and she 'll be fine . " <p> " Are you sure ? " <p> " Positive . I talked to Mom about it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad sent that e-mail without even asking her . Anyway , you should call them , of course , but do n't worry . Everything 's okay . " Her voice broke on the last word and there were little sighing sounds . It took Ava a few seconds to realize that her sister was crying . " I 'm sorry , " Lauren said , her voice thick . " I 've been doing this ever since I got the e-mail , even though I know everything 's fine . I think it was the shock of thinking Mom could be that sick . " <p> " I know what you mean , " Ava said . " But she 's not , right ? " <p> " But what if something goes wrong ? Or there 's a next time and it 's more serious ? They 're getting old , Ava . " She took an audible deep breath . " Anyway , you should call Mom now . But remember- do n't overreact . " <p> " I would n't dream of it , " Ava said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her father answered . " Finally you call . " <p> " I only just got your e-mail a few minutes ago , " she said . " But I spoke to Lauren and- " <p> " You called her before you called us ? " <p> " Your line was busy , " Ava said . " And she called me , which by the way is what normal people do when they have to give scary bad news . They pick up the phone-they do n't send mass e-mails telling people their mother has cancer . " <p> " I had to do it by e-mail , " he said . " You know how touchy you girls are . No matter who I called first , the other one would have been hurt . " <p> " That 's not true , " Ava said . <p> " It is true , " he said . " Lauren called us right away , you know . " <p> Ava let out a slow breath between her teeth . " May I talk to Mom ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put her mother on the phone . <p> Her mother sounded oddly cheerful . " It 's good to hear from you , sweetie ! " she said . " How are things at work ? " <p> " Fine , " Ava said . " How are you ? " <p> " I 'm so fine it 's embarrassing , " Nancy said . " I 'm sorry about that e-mail . Your father wanted you girls to know as soon as possible that I 'm dealing with this thing , but it 's really nothing all that serious . " <p> " Tell me exactly what the doctor said . " <p> " He said I have a few cancerous cells in my breast . It 's hardly even a lump-just the beginning of one . " <p> " How 'd they find it ? " <p> " Oh , something showed up on a mammogram and then they did a biopsy and it came back positive . " <p> Ava felt vaguely that a good daughter would have already known that her mother was having breast cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauren had . <p> Her mother was still talking . " - the thing about this family , " she said . " I love you all dearly , but little things become big ones . First your dad with that over-the-top e-mail , and then Lauren calling up sobbing as though the world had ended and insisting on coming home- " <p> " She 's coming home ? " Ava said . " She did n't tell me that . " <p> " Day after tomorrow . I told her not to , but she insisted . She 's been living across the country from us for years and suddenly she ca n't be apart from me for one more day . She can be so melodramatic . " <p> " Yeah , " Ava said . " I 've met her . " <p> " But since she is coming , I thought we could all have dinner together Friday night . Can you make it ? " <p> " I 've got to check , " Ava said , pulling her keyboard closer so she could get to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her mother said . " It 's my dying wish . You have to honor your mother 's dying wish to get her family together . " <p> " That 's not funny , " Ava said . <p> " It 's a little bit funny , " her mother said . " See you on Friday . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
