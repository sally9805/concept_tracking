The silence , I 'm told , is way worse than the snoring . In the middle of the night , you go quiet for a while . Your chest heaves . Nada . Your body tries again . Still nothing . Then , if you 're lucky , your brain kicks in and sends out the alarm : without oxygen , it will starve . So your reflexes get your body to rouse ; there 's a snuffling , wheezing and then a big intake of breath . And then back to normal breathing  --  or more snoring  --  until the cycle starts again . And all the while , you 're fast asleep , blissfully unaware that anything is going on . <P> This is called sleep apnea . It happens when your nasal passages or throat gets blocked during sleep and your breathing is badly interrupted . It 's often , but not always , correlated with carrying too much weight , and it occurs more in men than in women . Most people who have it have no idea . I sure did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleep clinic to get myself examined . With all my spluttering and huffing and puffing , he was sometimes alarmed that I might not make it through the night . Sleeping next to all this was nightmarish . So I went along , skeptical but willing . <P> After a brief educational video , I was placed in a bed with a forest of small wires attached to sensors all over my head and face and even legs . The staff trained a video camera on me and fitted me with a brace to measure my chest movement . Then I was told to relax and fall asleep . Yeah , right . Eventually I did . And then halfway through the night , a nurse came in and put a special mask on my face . It looks like a respirator , which is what it is . The CPAP ( an acronym for continuous positive airway pressure ) machine is designed to blow air at a steady pressure into your airways to keep you breathing regularly . Hooked up , I drifted off again . The nurse measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CPAP to maximize my sleep . <P> In the morning I had a truly unexpected sensation . The nurse woke me up at 5:45 , a time of day I had n't really experienced since high school . And I felt fine . More than fine , actually . I felt like a 10-year-old after a cappuccino . Since I normally take a couple of hours after I wake up ( around 10 a.m. ) to arrive at even moderate alertness , I was stunned . What had happened ? A week later , I got my results from the sleep clinic . Without the CPAP , I had stopped breathing on average 38 times an hour . I had got absolutely no Stage 4 sleep , the kind that really refreshes your mind and body . With the CPAP machine , I breathed normally , and 17% of my sleep was Stage 4 . No wonder I felt better . And that was after only four hours of good sleep . <P> How long had I been laboring against apnea-produced tiredness , irritability and lack of stamina ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's almost impossible to self-diagnose ( because you are unconscious when it happens ) , and its symptoms are easily explained by other possible factors . Nodding off in the afternoon ? Too much work . Snuffling at night ? Just a snoring problem . Irritability ? A character problem . Constant need for naps ? Idleness . Before you know it , you 're addicted to Red Bull and constantly grumpy . Sound like you ?
