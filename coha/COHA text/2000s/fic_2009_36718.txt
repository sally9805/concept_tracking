Lady Stephanie Welles entered the Blue Room , paused , and at once noted that almost every man in the room was looking at her . She was pleased , but not surprised , for she had long known that her ability to draw attention was highly developed . She was wearing a crimson gown with such a breathtakingly wide skirt that it made her waist look as if a man could span it with his hands and overlap his fingers . Her eyes and her lips gave a hint of her will and her pride . She was tall and shapely in a manner that would draw any man 's eyes . Aware of the effect her entrance had on those who watched her , she tilted up her head in an imperious manner and then turned toward the three women who were waiting for her . <p> Marchioness Rachel Reis rose and moved across the room , her raven black hair framing her face , her Jewish blood evident in her features . She was an attractive woman of twenty-eight , not tall but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Welles . <p> " I 'm glad you were able to come , Lady Stephanie . It 's a good cause we 're working for , " she said , smiling , and waited for a reply . <p> A caustic humour touched Lady Stephanie 's eyes . " Of course-and I 'm always anxious to do my bit for a good cause . " She saw the expression on Lady Reis 's face and laughed . " You find that amusing ? Well , I have to do some good works , or I wo n't get into heaven , will I ? " <p> " You will be able to add your contribution to the London Festival of Arts . The profits will go to help the poor of our city . " <p> " I 'm not sure what I can do to help . " <p> " There will be work enough for us all-but just your name and your support are greatly appreciated . Come and we 'll get started . " <p> The two high-society women made their way over to a table where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm amazed that Stephanie has volunteered to help with the festival , " said Baroness Danielle DeMain , a tall woman with a fine figure and aristocratic features . " She 's not known for her good works , is she , Margaret ? " <p> " Now , Danielle , do n't be harsh . " Countess Margaret Acton was a short , rather well-padded woman of thirty-three . She had a wealth of light brown hair and a pair of warm brown eyes . " She just wants to help , I 'm sure . " <p> Lady DeMain smiled . " You 'd speak well of Judas Iscariot-or of the devil himself , Margaret . And I 'm not sure that Stephanie is n't the devil-no , the devil is a male . But Stephanie must be one of his demons . " <p> " Shh ! She 'll hear you , Danielle ! " She rose and smiled , saying , " I 'm so glad you 've decided to join us , Lady Stephanie . " <p> " Why , as I just remarked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She paused and smiled thinly . " I see skepticism in your faces . Well , you are right . I 'm not given to holy causes-if that 's what the festival is . I always thought it was about greedy artists trying to gouge more money out of buyers . " <p> Lady DeMain laughed . " You are right , Stephanie , to some degree . But as you know , 25 percent of all sales will go to help the poor . " <p> The four women ordered lunch and discussed ways to entice more influential citizens to join them . Suddenly Lady DeMain exclaimed , " Look at that ! " Her three companions turned to see what she meant , and Lady Welles laughed . " I thought this was an exclusive restaurant . What in the world are those women doing here ? " <p> " I know one of them , " Rachel Reis said , her voice strained . " Her name is Martha Bingham . She 's been after me to join her organization . She 's really quite a bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyeing the trio . " Not a crusade to wear the ugliest clothing in England , is it ? " <p> Indeed , the three women advanced toward their table . The leader was a tall , strongly built woman with a squarish face , a prow of a chin , and dark brown hair . She pulled up in front of the seated women and stridently said , " My name is Martha Bingham . I have come to enlist your aid in helping the women of England assume their rightful place in our society . This young woman is my aide . Her name is Miss Jeanne St. Clair . And this is Miss Violet Bates , my secretary . They will be glad to assist you in filling out papers that will enable you to join us . We have a place for each of you . " <p> " And what is that place , Miss Bingham ? " asked Lady DeMain . She was amused at the woman but at the same time annoyed that they had invaded the restaurant . <p> " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bingham said . " I believe you have all received my invitation ? " <p> " Oh dear , yes , " Lady Welles said . " I think I remember something of the sort . Please send no more . My wastebasket is full of such ' invitations . ' " <p> A young woman to Miss Bingham 's left suddenly took a step forward . She had blue eyes and reddish-blonde hair . She was wearing a plain black taffeta dress that revealed a trim and rather athletic figure . Her voice was low , but a thread of anger tinted her words . " You call yourselves women ? Fah ! You 're nothing but slaves to men who bargained with your parents for rights to your bodies ! I despise you ! " <p> " Now , that will do ! " Lady Welles said angrily . " You know nothing about us ! You have no idea what nobility means ! " <p> " Do I not ? " <p> Margaret Acton was shocked at the vehemence in Jeanne St. Clair 's face . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbed as she spat out the words , " Noblemen can be full of evil ! You do n't know what 's happened to me . A member of Parliament " - she broke off in angry sobs- " he went to church every Sunday ... It was wrong , I tell you , wrong what he did to me ! Is that what nobility is ? " <p> " That will do ! " Lady DeMain said loudly . She saw that the manager had approached and said , " Howard , show these women out ! " <p> Mr. Howard , a tall , thin man , had been watching the scene nervously , and now he scurried forward , saying , " I must ask you ladies to leave . " <p> Martha Bingham 's face reddened . " I will not leave until I have spoken to these women . " <p> " Howard , get rid of them ! " Lady Welles said . " Call a policeman if necessary . " <p> " I trust that will not be necessary . You must leave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Joseph , help these ladies out , please . " <p> " Yes , Mr. Howard . " The man advanced , reached out , and took the arm of Martha Bingham . Then , at that instant , Miss Bingham 's secretary began to weep . Joseph pulled at Miss Bingham 's arm , but Jeanne St. Clair leapt forward and struck him a powerful blow in the throat . He stepped back , his face crimson , and began to gag . <p> Chaos took over . Martha Bingham shouted her message ; the manager ran from the room but soon returned with a policeman . He was a broad-shouldered fellow , and when Jeanne tried to hit him , he simply shoved her to the floor and took Martha Bingham 's arm . " You 're under arrest for disturbing the peace . Come along now . Do n't make things worse . " <p> Margaret Acton was shaken by the event . She watched them leave , and when they were at the door , Martha Bingham turned and shouted , " You 're unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But that will change ! We do n't need you or your fancy title ... ! " Margaret then saw the large woman turn and put her arm around the younger secretary . She patted her back and spoke soothingly to her . <p> " She 's got some affection in her , " Margaret said in a murmur . <p> " I suppose even wild beasts in the jungle have some sort of tender feelings for their offspring , " Lady DeMain said . " But that other one , she 's as wild as any tiger ! " <p> " What a fine dinner ! " Lady Welles said . " The entertainment was very exciting . Well , I must go . Not , " she added , " to enlist in Miss Bingham 's organization . There are ways to master men without force . They 're weak creatures , after all . " <p> * * * <p> Three days after the scene with Martha Bingham , Lady Stephanie Welles had almost forgotten it . She had told her husband , Lord Herbert , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be locked up ! " <p> " I 'm going out tonight , Herbert . " Stephanie noted that her husband was not interested enough to ask where she was going , but she was accustomed to this . She dressed and got into her carriage , saying , " Take me to the Old Vic Theatre , Alvin . " <p> " Yes 'm , Lady Stephanie . " He spoke to the horses and soon they were on Drury Lane . As always , the area was bustling with activity even as the sun went down over London . Although it was one of the better sections of the city , Lady Welles was slightly on edge , as always , for even here good and evil mingled . Side by side with noble ladies dressed in the finest of clothing , prostitutes with painted faces and gaudy attire paced in the flow of traffic . One expected to find harlots in the Seven Dials District or London 's notorious St. Jiles District , known as the Rookery , but here in the heart of London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The theatre crowd filled the street , all headed toward one of several playhouses . For most the destination was the Old Vic . As her carriage drew up in a line in front of the theatre , Lady Welles waited until the driver hopped down and opened the door for her . " Here we are , ma'am . " <p> " Very good , Alvin . You 'll have to watch when the crowd comes out and be sure you do n't park too far away . " <p> " Oh no , ma'am . I 'll be on watch for you . " <p> Lady Welles reached into her reticule , pulled out a coin , and handed it to him . " Buy yourself a good dinner . It 's rather a long play , I understand . " Without waiting for a reply , she turned and moved down the street toward the entrance of the Old Vic . A line was waiting to buy tickets , but she simply walked by them , and when she reached the door , she handed the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , you 're just in time . " The doorman smiled , a tall , sallow-faced man with badly fitting false teeth . " Shall I show you to your seat ? " <p> " That wo n't be necessary , thank you . " <p> As she joined the flow of people moving through the large foyer , Lady Welles attracted the eyes of both men and women . She was a graceful and strikingly beautiful woman elegantly dressed tonight in a polished blue-and-grey-striped taffeta skirt with a white silk blouse and lace ascot with a small pearl stick pin . She wore a sapphire comb in her hair and a sapphire and diamond necklace that glittered under the gaslight as she moved . Men 's eyes seemed drawn to her , but she paid no heed as she made her way . The theatre was filling rapidly , but as she moved toward her seat , she was conscious of the chandeliers blazing so brightly one could barely look at them . The women everywhere wore glamourous jewels that sparkled on arms and throats and wrists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and velvet , along with the warmth of peach- and rose-tinted costumes , gave a flaring vibrancy to the room . <p> She took her seat amidst the rustle and the whisper of the fabric of her dress , conscious of the voices and of the bursts of laughter that broke out from time to time . She turned at once to the woman who was seated next to her , and as she sat down , she said with surprise , " Why , Helen , I did n't expect to see you here . " <p> Lady Helen Maddox was a short , rather dumpy woman but made every attempt to compensate for her lack of graceful figure by expensive dress . She wore a crimson gown that did nothing for her rather ashen complexion , but it was beautifully cut , the full sleeves ostentatiously decorated with blue velvet bows at the shoulders . She had a pair of lively grey eyes , and when she smiled and greeted Lady Welles , there was genuine pleasure in her voice . " Why , it 's you , Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was afraid I 'd have to sit by a bricklayer or some other impossible being . " <p> " Then both of us are happy . I was dreading that I might have to sit beside a ranting Methodist and be preached at . " <p> The two women sat there chatting , for they were old friends . Both of them were of the nobility . Lady Stephanie 's husband , Sir Herbert Welles , was a member of the House of Lords . Lady Maddox 's husband was a mere baronet whose title would cease to exist when he did the same himself . Nevertheless , they were both addressed by the title " Lady . " <p> " Look over there , Stephanie , " Helen said , her eyes glittering with excitement . " Up there in the first balcony . " Stephanie looked up and at once saw what Helen was so excited about . " The Prince of Wales , " she murmured . <p> " Yes , and look at that woman with him . One of his mistresses , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's terrible ! " Helen exclaimed , not taking her eyes from the heavyset man with the pointed beard and the woman who sat beside him . " The Queen is terribly disappointed in the Prince . He 's nothing but a wastrel . " <p> " So the gossip goes . " <p> " Oh , dear me , it 's not gossip ! He has all sorts of women , some of them noble , if you can believe it . I think the one with him is an actress . " <p> Stephanie took a closer look . " She 's attractive . Rather gaudy , I should say , but better than his usual choices , I would guess . " <p> The two women sat there talking about the royal family , for Queen Victoria and her husband , Prince Albert , were symbols of the solidarity of the British Empire . It was well known that Victoria had fallen madly in love with the German prince , and that even after they had produced a house full of children , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow this union pleased the British public . They were more accustomed to their rulers being either without morals or able to conceal their baser doings adeptly . But Queen Victoria was , indeed , a most moral and upright woman . She had none of the flamboyance of Queen Elizabeth , but she was better at this point in time for England than that redheaded , almost manlike woman had been . <p> The crowd grew noisier , and nobility and working persons were strewn throughout the audience . True , some of the better seats were more expensive , but many commoners afforded them , and a duke might find himself sitting next to a mere shopkeeper . Stephanie turned to ask , " I suppose you 've seen Macbeth ? " <p> " Oh , indeed , I have ! I 've been to this production three times . " <p> " Why in the world would you do that ? " <p> Helen shook her head . " You 'll see when the play starts . It 's Dylan Tremayne who plays the leading role . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-looking man in England ! " <p> Stephanie was rather bored and shrugged her shoulders . " That 's part of a stock in trade of actors , is n't it ? They 're supposed to be good-looking . " <p> " Oh , he 's more than fine-looking ! " Helen insisted . She leaned over and talked with excitement . " He has something about him that draws your attention the minute he comes onstage , and he 's exactly the same offstage . " <p> " You mean he 's sexually alluring ? " <p> Helen stared at Lady Stephanie . " Well , I would n't have put it in exactly those words , but in a way I suppose you 're right . Women just ca n't resist him . " <p> " I shall do my best to keep from leaping out of my seat and running up and throwing myself at his feet . " <p> Helen laughed . " You 're making fun of me , but you wait and you 'll see ! " <p> Five minutes later the curtain parted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times , and in all truth had been rather bored with the main character . She had told her husband , " Herbert , that character Macbeth in the play by Shakespeare , he bores me to tears . He has no pluck . His wife has all the courage . " <p> Lord Herbert had smiled at her . " His wife loses her courage , remember ? " <p> " Of course she does . Women always have to bear their husbands ' shortcomings . " <p> Herbert had laughed . " I wonder what Shakespeare would say to that . " <p> As the play unfolded , Stephanie kept her eye on Dylan Tremayne mostly because of what Helen had told her . She had been prepared to dislike him , for as a rule , pretty men , overly handsome ones , were rather hollow on the inside . But as Dylan Tremayne moved across the stage , there was virility and a strength in his motions , and when he turned to look out over the audience , his eyes were the bluest she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Helen had insisted , Tremayne was more than just a fine-looking man . <p> There was one intermission , and both Lady Helen and Lady Stephanie were uncomfortably warm . It was the beginning of summer , and there were no windows to admit a breeze , so each of them had brought a handkerchief to mop her brow . <p> " Well , what do you think now ? " Helen asked , turning to give Stephanie an enquiring look . " Is n't he everything I said he would be ? " <p> " I give you this , he is fine-looking-and he does have a certain flair . " <p> " A certain flair ? Come now , Stephanie , admit it . You could n't take your eyes off him , could you ? " <p> Stephanie suddenly laughed . " He does have whatever it is that some people have . Women have it sometimes . Men ca n't take their eyes off of them . There can be twenty women in a room , but when a woman with this quality appears-every man turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the way it is with Tremayne , only it 's the women staring .
