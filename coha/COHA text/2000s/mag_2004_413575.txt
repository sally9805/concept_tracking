Lately , more and more straight chicks seem game for getting it on with another girl . Cosmo explores the bi-curious trend . // " WHEN I GO OUT WITH MY FRIENDS , WE DANCE , KISS , AND RUB UP AGAINST EACH OTHER . IT 'S FUN ! AND PEOPLE DO NT GIVE US WEIRD LOOKS . " These days , you ca n't turn on the TV without heaiing about girl-on-girl action , from the openly out celebs ( like Portia de Rossi and Rosie O'Donnell ) to the Madonna/Britney kiss to the Showtime series The L Word . The result ? A number of straight women are becoming bi-curious , meaning they are eager to find out firsthand what all the hype is about . And though guys are reputed to be turned on by the thought or visual of two chicks fooli ng around , women 's interest in exploring lesbianism goes beyond just turning the boys on . " All of a sudden , there 's this cool factor associated with it , " explains Logan Levkofl , a sexologist in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women exploring their sexuality on television , and it 's intriguing . " In fact , in a Cosrrio online survey , more than half of respondents admitted to kissing another girl . We decided to take a closer look at the bi-curious trend and examine why a growing number of heterosexual chicks seem to be turning hetero-flexible . Why Now ? In the last few years , women have become way more in touch with what turns them on , says sex therapist Gina Ogden , PhD , author of Women WholMve Sex . " They know more than they ever have about how to enjoy themselves in bed , and that has led to more experimentation . " Carlie* , 29 , has a serious boyfriend , but she sees nothingwrong with kissing girls : " I do n't think it 's a big deal anymore . When I go out with my friends , we dance , kiss , and rub up against each other . It 's fun ! And people do n't give us weird looks . " Why would they ? Beer commercials where women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches arc a daily sighting . " The media are creating a shift in attitude toward lcshians , " says Jennifer Bair , PhD , asociologi st at Yale University , who teaches a class on sex and gender in society . " Just look at TTie L Word . " The Showti me series , featuring a group of gorgeous , successful lesbians looking for love , is just another indication that mainstream society is getting more comfortable with gay women . And thanks to the Internet , curious gals can test the waters with just a point and click , which has further fueled this trend . " The Web allows for an anonymity that some may need to take the plunge , " says Ogden . Certain sites allow women to chat with others about their fantasies , view steamy pictures , or even tiy out bi-curious online dating without making actual contact . Is It just Women ? All this opon-mindedness seems to be gender specific . In other words , chances are , you 're not going to catch your boyfriend making out with his football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would probably turn you off . " For a variety of reasons , men are n't as comfortable exploring it , and society is n't as accepting of it , " says Levkoff . For starters , women are more affectionate and more emotionally attached to one another than the average group of guys , which is why it 's easier for some females to blur the line between friendship and sex . " I 've talked to hundreds of women who are happily married or in a relationship , but their strongest bond is with their best girlfriend , " says Ogden . " I 'm not saying every woman is a lesbian or bisexual at heart . But if . more women allowed their platonic . relationships to go even deeper , I think there 'd be a lot more overt sexuality between best friends . " Several years ago , Katie , 28 , became one of those women . She confessed to her best buddy that she had a crush on her , and it turned out to be mutual . In fact , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of their beaus , who loved it . " She 's my best friend , and I was making lier feel good . We went shopping and bong it lingerie together beforehand . The experience was really sensual . " Also , women are generally more secure in their female roles and not as afraid that their femininity is going to be questioned if they cross over . " The definition of what it means to be a real man is still very narrow , " says psychologist Aline P. Zoldbrod , PhD , coauthor of Sex Talk : Uncensored Exercises for Exploring What Really Turns You On . " The negative assumption is that if you hook up with another guy , you 're not a real man . But if you 're a woman and you hook up with women , you 're still considered just as female . " Plain old biology plays a part as well . In a recent study done at Northwestern University , when straight men were shown gay porn , the rate of physiological arousal was low ( no surprise there ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they became just as aroused as when watehing the straight porn films . " The study led experts to the conclusion that males and females are hardwired completely differently when it comes to sex , " says clinical psychologist Margaret Nichols , PhD , director of the Institute for Personal Growth , a therapy practice that includes sexual minorities . " Women have more of an innate bisexual response . " Of course , even though men are n't as open to homoerotic exploration , they 're cheering on the hetero-flexible women . " Men are more visual creatures and are easily aroused by a sexy sight , " says Levkoff . " So two beautiful women together is the ultimate eye candy . The more boobs , the merrier . " " I 've always found women attractive , so it was my idea to hook up with another girl while my boyfriend watched , " says Sue , 31 . " Once I brought it up , my guy began pushing for it . We picked up a girl . She and I kissed and engaged in oral sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were both incredibly excited by it , but I 'm not entirely sure I 'd do it again . After the fact , I think my boyfriend and I felt weird about bringing another person into the equation . " Where Do You Fit In ? It 's tough to put a label on one 's lusty pursuits . " Most people are n't one hundred percent gay or one hundred percent straight , " says Nichols . " On a scale of O to 6 , 0 being exclusively straight and 6 being exclusively gay , many are 2s or 5s . " And those numbers are n't fixed . " What you choose one day , or even for a few months , may not be what you are going to be doing forever , " says Levkoff . So just because you dabble in a gay relationship , that does n't necessarily mean you 're a lesbian for life . But whatever your orientation , one tiling is very clear : It 's complicated emotional terrain , so if you choose to explore your bi-curious impulses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITH ONE ANOTHER THAN GUYS ARE , SO IT 'S EASIER FOR THEM TO BLUR THE LINE BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND SEX . Sidebar BI-CURIOUS BABES WHO CAME BEFORE Here , we take a historical look at the women who blazed the bisexual trail . THE ISLAND OF LESBOS I In ancient Greece , young women attended finishing schools to prepare for marriage . But some scholars think there was less marriage prep and more same-sex experimentation going on . THE AMAZON WOMEN These mythic Greek chicks were known for their female-dominated society . Some experts believe while they had children with neighboring men , they slept and lived with each other . THE BLOOMSBURY GROUP This group of English writers and artists in the early 1900s ( think Virginia Woolf ) considered lesbian love to be a badge of sexual freedom and forward-thinking hipness . THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE In the 1920s , African-American artists were hooking up with each other . " It was a time of great openness , " says Robyn Ochs , an activist for gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender rights . Footnote * Names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
