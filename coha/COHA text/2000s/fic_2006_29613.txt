Chapter One TATE DID N'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT STYLE , but he knew that the woman standing beside the rough board wall of the small depot was fashionably dressed . He had glanced at her when he left the ticket counter and had wondered what she was doing in this rugged Texas town . She was obviously a city woman and as out of place as a rose in a cactus patch . Light blond hair fell to her shoulders . She wore a small blue felt hat that matched her princess-style coat , which came down over slim hips . The flared blue skirt that floated down around her calves was edged with a blue satin ribbon . Her matching shoes , with slender heels , were planted firmly beside an expensive leather valise . What a silly hat , Tate thought , chuckling to himself . It 'd offer no shade at all . Within ten minutes , her face would be cooked in the West Texas sun . Worried about her trunk , Kate had stepped down from the train to make sure it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her it had been left at the last stop and was being picked up by the train from Marietta , she had decided to wait and go on to California on the same train as her belongings . She wondered now at the wisdom of her decision . Shortly after she 'd spoken with him , the agent had locked up and left . Now all who remained on the platform with her were alone cowboy and the button salesman who had been on the train since New Orleans . The sun was setting in the western sky . Purple shadows were sliding down from the hills . It would be dark soon . A slight chill had entered the air with the disappearance of the hot summer sun . The depot was far from town ; only a sprinkling of lights shone from the houses . The train from Marietta was n't due for another hour . It would be pitch-dark by then . She was glad for the presence of the cowboy at the end of the platform . She 'd first glanced at him when he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew that she should n't make eye contact with the strange man in dusty boots and well-worn jeans . His hair was black , and he wore a battered , wide-brimmed hat . His mouth was set in a thin line as if he somehow disapproved of her . What was he doing here at this time of night ? Regardless of his appearance , she was glad he was here ; she did n't want to be alone with the other man . The salesman , dressed in a striped suit and a derby hat , paced back and forth near his sample case . She 'd had the misfortune to take the same route to California that he had chosen . When they first boarded the train in New Orleans , he 'd prattled on and on about buttons and snaps for hours . His twitchy , talkative nature and the way he looked at her gave her the creeps . As the three stood waiting for the train , it seemed to her that they were the only people in all this vast and desolate land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeaky hinges . An old man pushed a trolley down to the end of the platform and left it so that its bundles could be loaded into the baggage car when the train arrived . Then he disappeared around the corner of the depot . The button salesman coughed and took a step toward her . She turned to see that the cowboy was looking in their direction , but she was n't sure who he was looking at . She pushed herself away from the wall and walked over to him . " Is this train usually on time ? " " Sometimes , " he said . " This is n't Grand Central Station , you know . " " Well , what do you know ? I thought it was . " She smiled up at him . But he did n't smile back . What did she expect ? He could n't take a joke . He 'd probably only heard of Grand Central Station and had never been there . " Thanks for that valuable information . " She turned and walked back to take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken the hint and moved back to his case . She looked at her watch but could n't see the time in the dim light . She nudged the leather valise at her feet ; if her trunk never arrived , at least she had clean underwear and her cosmetics . Then , in the distance , she heard the familiar sounds of a train approaching . Could the thing be earlier than the agent predicted , or had an hour passed already ? She looked at the cowboy and saw that he was peering down the track toward the east . She looked in that direction too , and soon she saw the billows of smoke rising up above the huge engine . The piercing whistle was loud enough to wake everybody for miles . The engineer was making a grand entrance into the station . Too bad only she , the cowboy , and the button salesman were there to appreciate the effort . The train rolled slowly past her before coming to a stop . Two cars were brightly lit and filled with passengers , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valise , walked to the edge of the platform , and waited for the conductor to step down from the train . He smiled , took her ticket , and helped her up the steps and into the car . The cowboy was right behind her and edged past the conductor . Katherine turned to the right and entered the car . Most of the seats were filled , but halfway down she saw what she thought was an empty seat . Carrying her valise , she made her way down the aisle and set it on the floor . When she turned , the cowboy was still right behind her . With a grunt , she attempted to lift the heavy bag up and put it in the rack above the seat . Quick as a whistle , the cowboy snatched it out of her hand , and as he slung it upward , the latch opened and her personal belongings spilled out over the seat and onto the floor . She looked down in horror to see a pair of her lace panties covering a pair of dusty cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more embarrassed than she 'd ever been in her entire life . All she could do was grunt in reply , " I bet you are . " The cowboy pulled her valise from the rack and set it on the seat beside her . He reached down and grabbed a handful of lavender lace panties , silk slips , and lacy bras and stuffed them back into the case . As he did , a jar of face cream fell onto his foot and opened . Katherine looked down to see the white cream running down over the cowboy 's boot . The smell of gardenias filled the air in the passenger car . All around the car , people were stretching their necks to look . She thought the cowboy said something under his breath . It sounded like " Oh , hell ! " but she was n't sure . Fearing that he would wipe the face cream off his boot with her lavender panties , she pulled a big handkerchief out of her pocket and handed it to him . He jerked it out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream off his boot . After glancing up and down the aisle to make sure he had picked up everything that had fallen from her bag , he tipped his hat toward Katherine and moved on to the front of the car in search of an empty seat . Fuming at the cowboy 's back as he walked away , Katherine sat down and moved over next to the window . He 'd made her look stupid in front of everyone ! She was certain that her face was beet red with embarrassment . What a grouch , she thought . It was n't her fault he was so clumsy . Were all the men in the West clods like him ? A cough that came from the aisle caused her to turn . The button salesman stood with his hand stretched out toward her . There , swinging from his fingers , was one of her bras . She snatched it from his hand , pushed it into the pocket of her coat , and looked back out the window . The salesman chuckled before walking on . Until now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What more might happen before she reached California ? Tate Castle moved on to the next car in the train in search of an empty seat . Finding one , he threw himself into it . He never wanted to see that woman again ! All he was trying to do was help her lift that damned bag . How was he supposed to know that it was going to fly apart ? Did women actually wear that kind of thing ? Holding a handful of those undergarments was like holding a handful of air ! He was glad finally to be heading home . It seemed like forever since he 'd seen his ranch , his friends , and , most important , his daughter . He 'd missed her terribly and knew that she 'd missed him too . It was still a couple of hours to Muddy Creek , where he would get off the train . He was bone-tired . Tipping his hat down over his eyes , Tate tried to sleep as the scent of flowers drifted up from his boot . The sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The train came to a stop at the next depot , a darkened little town called Los Rios . A new group of passengers came on board . A heavyset woman carrying bundles of clothing under her arms came down the aisle and plunked herself in the seat beside Katherine . The woman looked over at her and grinned , showing snuff-stained teeth . Katherine smiled , then quickly turned away ; it was obvious that the woman had not bathed in quite a while . " Hello , dearie , where are you goin ' ? " Katherine acted as if she had n't heard , and kept her face turned toward the window . " I 'm going to St. Elena to see my brother and sister , " the woman offered . " I 've not seen them in two years . " Katherine turned briefly and said , " How nice for you . " The woman 's odor was sickening . " My brother 's been sick , " the woman continued , " and my sister lost her husband not long ago . Between you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't worth diddly-squat ! Too lazy to come in out of the rain , you know ? " " Too bad . " The train lurched and then moved smoothly down the track . The smelly woman kept talking , not seeming to care that her audience was n't listening . Katherine leaned her head against the window , her thoughts wandering . A year ago she had received her nursing degree , fulfilling a lifelong dream . After she had worked for a couple of years in a clinic in New York City , her uncle in California made an offer that she could n't refuse . He was a doctor at a large hospital in San Francisco and wanted her to come out and assist him . Jumping at the chance , Katherine packed up her belongings and headed West . She was looking forward to seeing new things and meeting new people . The leave-taking from her father had been painful . They had always been close , and he had supported his daughter 's dreams . She was sure she had seen tears in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , her stepmother , whom her father had married when Katherine was very young , had merely waved good-bye and declared that she would n't be surprised to see Katherine back at home within a matter of weeks . Susie , her half-sister , thought Katherine had lost her mind even to want to go out to such a backwater place as California when there was so much to do right there in New York City . All she could expect to find out there were farmers and orange trees . Kate knew , though , that Susie was glad to get her out of the way so she would have a better chance with Edwin , the handsome nephew of her father 's business partner , William Jacobs . Susie need n't have worried ; although Edwin was a handsome man , Kate had never had any interest in him as a beau . The woman 's voice broke into her thoughts . " My nephew done fell down a well and drowneded . Was n't too bright , that boy . " Katherine 's thoughts traveled back over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more distant from the family . She was so involved in all her social activities that she was seldom at home . And when she was , she belittled Katherine for her devotion to nursing and her lack of interest in finding a suitable husband , a man who could support her in style . Susie was like her mother . She loved the social life . The only things that seemed to matter to her were the latest fashions , dinner parties , and who was seeing whom . Katherine , on the other hand , was her father 's daughter . Both of them enjoyed reading , talking business , and even an occasional game of bridge . Since her early childhood , they had been devoted to each other . While he also cared for Susie , Katherine knew that she was his favorite . She leaned her head against the window and looked out into the lightening morning . The sun had begun to poke up over the hilltops . Telegraph poles whizzed by , and occasionally the train passed a cluster of houses . Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hint , but she kept right on talking . She talked so incessantly about her dog , her assorted aches and pains , and her lazy husband who was angry that she was making the trip that Katherine wanted to jump up and move ; but there were no empty seats . To top it all off , someone behind her had lit a cheap cigar , filling the cramped car with smoke . At least it helped mask the stink of the woman ! The conductor came through . " We will be stopping in a few minutes to take on water . Everyone please stay on the train . " Katherine thought it would be wonderful to get a few breaths of fresh air . She hated the cramped feeling of the railway cars . When the train finally came to a stop , she excused herself and , with her handbag over her arm , managed to squeeze out in front of the fat lady and into the aisle . As she moved toward the front of the car , Katherine noticed that the button salesman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his face . Light snores came from his open mouth . Katherine moved on past him . I hope he sleeps all the way to San Francisco . The conductor had opened the door and was standing out on the platform . After checking the watch that hung from a chain on his vest , he moved into the next car . As soon as he walked away , Katherine quickly stepped down and moved to the side of the steps , out of the light that came from the car . Oh , it was great to breathe the fresh air . She looked off into the darkness and saw a long trough swing down toward the train . Then she heard the rush of water pouring into the engine 's tank . Suddenly something hard was jammed into her back and a hand grabbed hold of her shoulder . The sound of a revolver cocking startled her . " Hello , Kate . " ( Continues ... )
