<p> The big bird has finally landed in Cherry Creek Shopping Center and it 's wearing Seven For All Mankind jeans and Kate Spade shoes and carrying a Burberry handbag . <p> After circling the coveted Cherry Creek mall for years , Nordstrom Inc. is getting ready to open a top-of-the-line store Oct. 19 . <p> Nordstrom 's long-awaited arrival in the upscale shopping center ends years of effort to get into the area and raises the already high-end reputation of the Cherry Creek mall . <p> It is n't the first Nordstrom in the Front Range , but it represents the acquisition of a long-desired clientele . <p> In 1996 , unable to garner a spot in the shopping center , the Seattle-based retailer set up shop at Park Meadows and later at FlatIron Crossing mall . As a result , Denver shoppers who longed for Nordstrom 's storied shoe department had to head to the suburbs . <p> " For Cherry Creek , it represents a unique opportunity to regain market share that was lost when Nordstrom opened in the other two malls , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center . " The Denver customer that enjoys Nordstrom will be able to stay in Denver . " <p> Nordstrom sees itself more as a boutique than <p> a large department store , with a mix of unique <p> merchandise , high-end designers and some of its own specially produced products : small specialty stores under one roof . <p> " We want to be where the best stores are , " said Erik Nordstrom , the company 's president of stores . " We want to be where there is a convergence of retail that attracts customers . We really like the mix of stores that are in Cherry Creek . " <p> With Nordstrom , Cherry Creek becomes one of only six shopping malls in the nation that can claim Nordstrom , Saks Fifth Avenue , Neiman Marcus and Macy 's as tenants , joining the ranks of such retail meccas as the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas and Fashion Valley in San Diego . <p> The arrival of Nordstrom will pad the offerings for upscale shoppers by adding a whole new merchandising base and presentation , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Group . <p> " Their key thinking is that you have to be at the right location , and that is why they wait so long for the right location , " Beemer said . Cherry Creek " is upscale , it 's fashionable and it continues to be an avant-garde area . " <p> The shopping center 's track record speaks for itself , LeMasters said . It is in the top 1 percent of revenue-producing malls in the country , he said . The shopping center and Cherry Creek North combined make up the single-largest sales tax revenue generator for the city and county of Denver , LeMasters said . <p> " It was not difficult for us to convince ( Nordstrom ) and it was not difficult for us to agree on a deal , " LeMasters said . <p> The Cherry Creek mall customer demographic is 65 percent female , 35 percent male , with a household income at or above $100,000 . The two groups that make up this demographic are affluent empty nesters and up-and-coming professionals in the 25-40-year-old range , typically with no children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have everything they ( core customers ) desire now , " LeMasters said . <p> Cherry Creek and Nordstrom have been courting for years . The first opportunity came when the shopping center was redeveloped in 1990 , but Nordstrom did n't take a pad , LeMasters said . <p> The company waited until 1996 to open the Park Meadows store because " Part of it was that we wanted to be at the best mall , Cherry Creek , but we could n't get in there , " Peter Nordstrom told the Denver Post in 2005 . <p> When Nordstrom opened the Park Meadows store , customers there began to ask for a store in Cherry Creek , Erik Nordstrom said . <p> " But it is n't that easy , " he said . " It 's a tight shopping center in an urban area , and it 's been difficult for the developer to help us get there . We tried on many occasions going back to my dad and his cousins , but it did n't happen . " <p> In the late 1990s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safeway location but that did n't come to fruition . <p> Not until two years ago , when Lord &; Taylor announced it was closing its Colorado stores , did the opportunity arise . <p> In 2005 the May Department Stores Co. , then-owner of Lord &; Taylor , sold its Cherry Creek site to the mall 's owner , Taubman Centers Inc. , to end litigation between both parties . That move allowed Nordstrom to obtain the space . <p> In March 2005 Nordstrom negotiated a deal to take over the Lord &; Taylor pad . <p> As Nordstrom has remodeled the site to its own style , other retailers have been primping for their new neighbor . <p> In the spring , Saks unveiled an updated look , and in Cherry Creek North , Andrisen Morton Women 's underwent a $1 million renovation . Executives at both stores said they were partly motivated by a desire to capture their share of the new traffic Nordstrom will generate . <p> " Anytime you have a new competitor coming into the market , you want to look at what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store revealed its new look . " You want customers to find something new in your store as well . " <p> Nordstrom has expanded the Lord &; Taylor space to 138,000 square feet , making it the mall 's second-largest department store after Macy 's . <p> Nordstrom 's other two stores in the area are much larger . The Park Meadows store is 245,000 square feet and FlatIron Crossing 's is 172,000 square feet . <p> But Erik Nordstrom said that , in recent years , most of the stores the company has opened have averaged 140,000 square feet . That 's largely because , as with Cherry Creek , the company has been moving into existing malls in urban areas as opposed to new shopping centers . <p> LeMasters expects the new store to significantly boost Cherry Creek 's already high sales . <p> " There 's no question we expect more considerable volume out of this store than Lord &; Taylor ever produced , " he said . <p> Elizabeth Aguilera : 303-954-1372 or eaguilera@denverpost.com  --  Twenty years of effort <p> 1986 - Seattle-based Nordstrom considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek as possibilities .
