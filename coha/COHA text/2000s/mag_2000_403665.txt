A year and a half ago , my son 's grade-eight graduating class assembled for a photo . As I surveyed the rows of fine-looking adolescents I turned to my wife and whispered , " Where are all the fat kids ? " Sure , a few were on the heavy side , but there was no sign of the epidemic of childhood obesity I 've been reading about for years . ( I saw more tall , very thin girls . ) Was my son 's class an anomaly ? Or have we been misled about the alleged increase in overweight children ? We do n't even have a good definition for obesity . When I hear obese , I think of Newman on Seinfeld . But experts define it simply as an excess of body fat . Is that a little too much , or a lot too much ? The estimated proportion of kids who are obese ranges from three percent to over 40 percent , depending on whom you ask . Very helpful . " I think it 's fair to say that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be regarded with caution , " admits Susan Crawford , a nutritionist at Simon Fraser University and co-author of the main Canadian study on overweight children . Crawford and her colleagues compared two earlier studies . Using data from the 1981 Canada Fitness Survey , they called children aged seven to 12 obese if their skinfold measures were in the 85th to 100th percentiles . ( These are done with calipers that measure the amount of body fat under the skin at five different places on the body . ) So , by definition , 15 percent of the youngsters were obese  --  a widely accepted standard in North American studies . Then , using a 1988 follow- up study called the Campbell 's Survey on Wellbeing in Canada , they found that 23.9 percent of kids had skinfold measures that would have put them above the 85th percentile in 1981 . In other words , the number of kids who qualified as obese had gone from about one in seven to almost one in four . That 's a whopping increase , but Crawford says we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight or a lot more . That analysis has n't been done . Crawford points out that the mid-1980s was about the time we witnessed some significant changes in our lifestyle : the invention of the TV remote , the proliferation of video games and computers , fewer kids walking to school and the growing junk-food aisle at the grocery store . Mind you , this is just a theory to explain the apparent increase in obese children  --  nobody has documented a change in activity levels or eating patterns of Canadian children in the past 20 years . But exactly where are those overweight kids hiding anyway ? Crawford offers two explanations . One is that obesity tends to be more prevalent in low socio-economic groups . This is something she has observed in her own research . She 's not sure why , but suspects it has to do with poor nutrition and less access to recreational opportunities . So schools with middle-class populations ( like my son 's ) might not look all that different from the way they did a generation ago . Her other explanation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fully clothed . Researchers at the University of Alberta studied obesity in 1,200 children using both skinfold measures and a visual assessment in which they simply looked at kids ( fully clothed ) and rated them slim , ideal , overweight or obese . In the visual assessment only five percent of the children were rated as obese , but by skinfold tests , again using the same standards as Crawford , 30 percent were deemed obese . That 's enough to make you wonder about the way obesity is defined . If kids have to get naked before you can tell , how fat can they really be ? And more to the point , does this mean that kids are less healthy ? We do n't know . Obesity is used as a health indicator in adults because it 's associated with high blood pressure , heart disease and other problems , but less than half of overweight children go on to be overweight adults . " The real issue is not weight , but your child 's overall health , " says Crawford . " Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important questions for individual parents . A slightly overweight child who eats a healthy diet and has an active lifestyle could well be more healthy than a thin child who does n't eat well and is not physically active .
