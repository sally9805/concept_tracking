HER NEIGHBORS SAID OF Angie Sweetwater that she was afraid of her own shadow , and in a way they were right , though not in the way they meant and not in any way that Angie - or her neighbors , for that matter - could have understood . The thing is , Angie had a nasty shadow , always thinking dark thoughts and itching to have a life of its own away from Angie and the little brick house on Wythe Lane where she lived all by herself . She 'd lived there alone like that for eighteen years ever since her husband Roy 's freak accident on I-95 . He 'd taken the exit ramp too fast , there was ice , and the car went over the shoulder . Roy , who never used his safety belt , was catapulted forty feet and had his head laid open by the sign that set the speed limit on the ramp at 30 . The Buick was n't scratched . <p> Angie had never learned to drive a car , so after the accident she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ordinary things like shopping that she 'd depended on Roy for . There was n't a grocery or convenience store anywhere within walking distance . Not that Angie ever did that much walking or would have . She got the exercise she needed out in the garden - or she used to , before the accident . The neighbors joked that she was getting to be just as planted as the old Buick inside the garage . Mrs. beaver , two houses down the street , offered to teach her to drive , but Angie 's reply was a flat no thank you . She relied on her son Tom to chauffeur her anywhere she needed to go , or else a taxi . And the Shop-Rite manager , who lived at the very end of Wythe Lane , delivered her groceries to her door as a special favor , even though Shop-Rite as a general rule did n't do deliveries . <p> So that was how she 'd got along for years , eating frozen dinners and getting out of the house less and less , especially after Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the area , and it was either that , Tom said , or food stamps . Once he was settled , he promised to look for a city apartment for her nearby where he lived , but that was out of the question . Angie was n't going to start living in any city at this point in her life . Tom swore Tacoma was n't dangerous , but how would he know ? That was ten years ago , since when Tom had managed to get back for a visit almost every year , and twice , for Christmas , he 'd brought his family along . <p> She never complained . She did n't even have complaining thoughts . But her shadow did . Her shadow got to be one big knot of gloom and hungers , like a pot-bound houseplant with its roots all sickly and tangled together . Shadows are like plants . They need sunlight simply to exist . They need to feel the air stir around them . They need to feel something physical - a bug will do - light down from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice squirt of birdshit that 'll leach down into their dirt , and our shadows have equivalent needs . They have hungers and day  --  dreams and vague longings for what they think would be freedom . Usually , those daydreams come to nothing , like most people 's , but that does n't matter , so long as there is some kind of input . They can get along on next to nothing . TV will serve their purpose most of the time , just like for people . Shadows may not have much of a life of their own , but what they can see on TV supplies that basic lack . But Angie did n't watch much TV . Wythe Lane was n't wired for cable , and the channels she could receive did n't show anything but foul language and violence . That would have suited her shadow fine , of course , but it was Angie who was in control of on and off . Shadows are usually helpless in that regard . <p> It finally reached the point where the only time Angie or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , sometimes , on Wednesday evenings , when Angie 's friend Lucille would pick her up and take her to the United Baptist Church in Chambersville . Lucille had been a beautician before she was married , so she also did Angie 's hair and nails every two or three weeks , at Angie 's home , after the Wednesday prayer meeting . <p> Angie 's shadow was always keenly attentive to everything that Lucille said or did during the beauty treatments . Those Wednesdays were the high points of the shadow 's limited life , and probably of Angie 's as well . So when Lucille brought up the subject of The Throne of Darkness Angie 's shadow was transfixed . It began to vibrate like a tuning fork that 's heard the vibration it 's been designed to pick up . <p> The Throne of Darkness was a paperback book by Cassandra Knye that Lucille had checked out , with four other paperbacks , from the Chambersville Municipal Library . Lucille had had a long-standing grievance with the library 's book selection process and with the chief librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something worse than anything up to now , an assault against the moral well-being of the entire community , especially the children . It was a threat that had to be met head on , and so Lucille was circulating a petition to have the book , and a number of others just like it , taken off the library shelves . Everyone at the prayer meeting had signed Lucille 's petition , even Pastor Raines , though he 'd refused to let Lucille read aloud the most offensive passages from the book , since they were there in the church basement . <p> But Lucille insisted on reading one of those passages now , while they waited for the tint to take . " Listen to this part , just listen.Locking herself away from the curious stares and whispers of the others , Sister Rosemond began to fear herself . She could n't sleep , and when she did the figure of Ariston would appear before her robed in white with golden sandals on his feet . The sands of the desert eddied about him , as though obedient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will . Nude and wet , she walked toward him across the burning sand . His arms embraced her , his lips parted in an obscene invitation . He drew away his white robe to reveal his grotesque nakedness and threw her down across  --  ' " <p> " Please , " said Angie . " Please do n't read any more . It 's just too .... I wish you would n't . " <p> " It gets worse , " Lucille promised . <p> " I 'm sure it does . " <p> " But you can see , just from that much , that it 's Satanism pure and simple . And any child can walk into that library and check out the book . " There was no getting her off it , and Angie had to sit there while Lucille finished with her hair and listen to it all , how children were playing a game called Dungeons and Dragons and then committing suicide , and how there were books in the library along the same lines . How there were crimes that the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying mysteriously . On and on . Finally Angie had to claim a headache and ask Lucille to leave without doing her nails . <p> When Lucille was gone , Angie went on sitting in the middle of the kitchen with the queerest feeling inside her . She looked down at her hands , where they were resting on her knees , and they looked wrong , all wrinkled and knobby and discolored . Roy used to joke that her name was really Angina at times like that when she 'd sit off by herself , not saying anything , claiming a headache . Which was n't true , the name on her birth certificate was Angelica , but no one had ever called her by that name in her entire adult life . Roy said it made her sound like a Catholic . <p> While she sat there , with the peculiar feeling , her shadow was breaking loose . Shadows usually ca n't do that . Most of them always stay fastened to the people they 're born with . Only if the person gets very weak and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break loose , and then the person usually dies soon after . You can see them like that in hospitals sometimes , though it mostly goes unnoticed , or misunderstood . People sitting by the bed may think a light comes into the person 's eyes just before they die , but it 's actually the reverse . Their shadows have left them , so their eyes look brighter for a little while before they finally go cloudy and dull at the very end . <p> Angie 's shadow had been gaining strength all the while Lucille had been reading from The Throne of Darkness . When Lucille had taken her leave , she 'd left the book behind , thinking Angie might look at it while she was by herself . Angie had n't even noticed the book sitting there on the kitchen counter , but her shadow had . <p> Her shadow wanted to know more about Rosamond and Ariston , but from where Angie was sitting only the spine was visible , not the picture on the cover . So there was a kind of tug of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , which was simpler and stronger , and finally it was her shadow who won . It broke loose , and now it was Angie who was helpless and her shadow who could move around and do things . <p> The shadow went over to the kitchen counter and looked at the cover of The Throne of Darkness . There was Ariston , his face all red but with deep shadows , as though he were standing above a bonfire , and there was Rosamond in a red silk gown that matched Ariston 's face . Yes , the shadow thought . I 'm so hungry . I want .... <p> But that was as far as it could get . It could n't think what it was it wanted . It opened the book and turned some pages , but that did n't help . Shadows ca n't read . Once they tear loose from people , shadows can get pretty stupid . They are like cockroaches , hungry and restless . <p> The shadow remembered the Buick sitting in the garage . Tom had tried to get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when she 'd proved stubborn about that , Tom did n't insist . He respected her feelings , and besides he figured the car would be his soon enough - a vintage 1976 Buick with low mileage and not a flake of rust . So each time he 'd come back to Wythe Lane , he 'd futzed with the car , keeping it tuned and polished . An investment . <p> Angie 's shadow got the keys from the kitchen drawer and went out to . the garage and started up the Buick and backed it straight into the garage door . Each of the four little panes of glass in the door was cracked , but they did n't shatter . The shadow did n't know quite what to do . It tried to raise the garage door , but it had got stuck to the Buick 's bumper . It got back into the car and put it into Drive and managed to tear the back bumper off the car . And that was it for the Buick . Its battery was dead . The shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point Angie 's shadow gave up on any idea of having a night on the town and went for a walk in the night air , which was freedom enough after all the time it had sat beside Angie in the house , doing nothing and wishing Angie were dead . It walked through the nearest back yards , setting a few dogs to barking , and then along a drainage ditch , where it finally fell asleep beside a cyclone fence designed to keep the neighborhood children from wandering onto the highway . Shadows need their sleep the same as people . <p> The shadow was awake and back in charge at the first glimmer of direct sunlight . For someone who had spent the night in a drainage ditch Angie looked in pretty good shape . Her metabolism had risen to the occasion , and though she was stiff in all her limbs , once her shadow had got her on her feet and brushed off the dead leaves , she looked like any other old lady standing in a drainage ditch at five A.rn. on a May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing enough to have incapacitated Angie , but the shadow had no compunctions about the neighbors and what they might have thought . It was aware of them , but only as a cockroach might be aware of the jars and boxes in the cupboard it inhabits , as potential sources of what it needed . <p> One of the neighbors in question appeared before the shadow now , Natalie , Mrs. Deaver 's teenage daughter . She said , " Mrs. Sweetwater you 're up early . " <p> The shadow smiled , and extended Angie 's hand to be shaken . It said , " Could I have a cigarette . " When there was no immediate response , it remembered to add , " Please . " <p> " A cigarette ? I 'm afraid I do n't smoke . I did n't think you did either , Mrs. Sweetwater . " <p> " I used to . Then I did n't for a while . Now I 'm a smoker again . " The shadow smiled its most plausible smile , but it resolved , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk another such encounter . The strain of pretending to be even such a simple creature as Angie Sweetwater was too taxing . <p> The shadow returned along Wythe Lane to Angie 's little brick house , drawn there by its memory of something on the kitchen counter . And it was there still , unemptied , the ash tray in which Lucille had stubbed out her three cigarettes last night . One of the things that Angie , and her shadow , had enjoyed about Lucille 's Wednesday visits was that Lucille was a smoker . Roy had been a smoker , too , and Angie had been as addicted to his second-hand smoke as Roy had been to it at first-hand . " I like how it smells , " she would tell people when they asked her if they could smoke when they visited . <p> She even liked the smell of these old butts in the ashtray , or her shadow did . It bent low over the little square of stippled amber glass and took a deep , luxuriating whiff . Shadows have a special affinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or obverse , or opposite . Not just whatever lies in darkness , but the dregs and refuse and wreckage that is left behind by floods or fires , the ashes in the grate , the fumes that linger in a garage or a basement . They take to such things by the same simple tropism that makes plants strain toward the sun or attracts bees to bright colors . <p> While certain complex tasks would have been beyond the shadow 's limited competence ( it could not have done the laundry , for instance , or made the bed ) , the shadow did understand that to smoke one of the butts from the ashtray it would have to be able to light it . But it could not think where Angie kept the matches , since she so infrequently had need of them that using them was not an ingrained habit , an automatism that came with the vehicle . It stood there stymied and peevish until it realized ( it would probably have taken Angie as long to do so ) that the stove could be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front burner , and then , positioning the cigarette in Angie 's pouted lips , stooped to get a light . It took care not to let anything but the splayed tip of the butt get close to the flame . At the first sting of smoke it drew back and savored the vaporized poisons of Lucille 's Salem . <p> The very qualities that made tobacco lethal to human health made it dear to the shadow , but even so the tissues of Angie 's throat , unused to the tickle of the smoke , reacted badly . The shadow could not stop-coughing , but neither could it resist another drag of mentholated smoke , nor a third , though by then the coughing had become violent , a convulsion . It flicked the cigarette across the kitchen , a bull's-eye into the plastic garbage can beside the sink . Angie herself would not have been so accurate . In many ways her shadow was more comfortable in her skin than she . <p> While Angie 's lungs recovered from their coughing fit in the platform rocker in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was engineered to do . A single wadded Kleenex caught fire , and flared , and , as it died , relayed its flame to the dry corner of an otherwise damp paper towel . Those flames in turn reached the crumpled cellophane that had been a cookie wrapper , after which , the entire contents of the can became a torch , the flames of which rose high enough to ignite the roll of towels in the dispenser and then the kitchen curtains and the flounce above . <p> From where it sat in the living room the shadow could not see the fire in the kitchen until it had spread beyond the area around the sink . Even when it became aware of what was happening it did not bestir itself to phone for help . Indeed , its impulse was rather to feed the flames than to damp them , from a sense that they were its own . Anyone who has built a great leaf-fire and seen the flames leap high has felt a similar vanity . It is our own shadow 's rapture we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something immense and unbounded , the shadow in mad-emperor mode . <p> As the flames spread through the house , flitting among those things most flammable , they also kindled scraps of psychic tinder in Angie 's own sere soul . For it was she , not the shadow , who began to hum " Some Enchanted Evening , " which long ago , at a bar in Orlando , Florida , a pianist had sung to her at Roy 's particular request on their fourth anniversary . Somehow this May morning , as she sat in her burning house , the dear old tune seemed the key to her whole life . The melody seemed endless , with no point along the way she could stop at , so that finally it was the shadow and not Angie who had to take the initiative and stagger up from the rocker and out the front door , almost invisible by then behind the billowing black smoke . <p> While the neighbors gathered to watch the arrival of the firemen and their losing battle , Angie sat on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spectator at her own disaster , yet as little distressed as if it had been a crisis on the evening news , a war in West Africa or riots at the Mexican border . <p> The shadow , meanwhile , gorging on the fire 's triumph was in a state of comatose surfeit , like a tick swollen with blood . When the emergency medical team showed up , it was determined , after Angie did n't answer their questions and they had filled out the appropriate forms , that she was in a state of shock . To spare everyone the discomfort of her inappropriate and weird lack of affect , Angie was sedated and taken off in the EMT ambulance . <p> When the sedative had worn off , Angie continued to pose a problem for the staff at Mercy Hospital , for she would not remain in her bed in the recovery ward ( a temporary assignment ) but would go wandering through the halls and lobby , confused and querulous . She could n't understand why her clothes had been taken from her and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her backside bare . <p> Anger was not an emotion in Angie 's usual repertory . She could do nothing but weep and ask to talk with her son in Tacoma . But Angie could not remember his number , which was unlisted . The shadow , still gorged , did nothing to help , nor could it have . It let her dither about in the public areas of the hospital and make a fuss like an ill-tempered pet locked in a parked car . <p> By the time Tom was contacted and had got to the hospital , Angie had calmed down , and the shadow had again assumed control . It lay in the hospital bed and glowered dully at Tom and the various strangers who had questions about the fire . Once or twice it had asked for a cigarette , but this produced no response except , from Tom , a suspicious string of questions . <p> The hospital 's diagnosis , which Tom did not think to question , was advanced Alzheimer 's . Tom did not want to complicate his life by bringing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She could n't be trusted under his family 's roof , even if his wife would have accepted that idea , since Angie had probably been responsible for the fire that had destroyed her own house . A neighbor 's daughter had seen Angie wandering about in a dazed manner on the morning of the fire , and at the hospital they had had to use restraints to keep her in her own bed . It was a sad situation , but not really that unusual . <p> For Alzheimer 's the standard solution was a nursing home and then an averted gaze . Living at a great distance might actually be an advantage - out of sight , out of mind . And so , before Tom returned to Tacoma , Angie was taken to live at Raines Adult Home outside of Chambersville . The home was operated by Amos Raines , a cousin of the pastor of United Baptist , which made it seem not quite as heartless as leaving Mrs. Sweetwater with complete strangers . She would have her own room , and Tom was introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-possessed to shake his mother 's hand and , with prompting , to say hello to her . <p> However , those two ladies , Mrs. Filbin and Mrs. Lynch , were about all the establishment could show for itself in terms of good P.R . The other residents , six males and three females , had been placed there by Chambersville Psychiatric Center under an adult care contract with the state . Basically , the Psychiatric Center used Raines Adult Home as a storage facility for its most hopeless geriatric cases , those with diagnoses , like Angie , of advanced Alzheimer 's . Most of them were also like Angie in being under the control of their shadows , a not uncommon condition among those in nursing homes . Indeed , just as certain insects and the orchids that imitate them have coevolved over the centuries so that their resemblance becomes ever more congruent , so shadows have co-evolved with those genuine behavioral disorders which offer them an alibi and a disguise - Alzheimer 's commonly , but also autism , bipolar disorders , and some forms of schizophrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Raines Adult Home who were ruled by their shadows ; so were two of the employees , the twin brothers Wilbur and Orville Halfacre . The Halfacres had spent almost their entire lives in institutional care , first , when abandoned in infancy , as recipients , now as dispersers . They were neither of them very bright , but they had both earned high school equivalency diplomas and gone on to receive training as medical technicians , and , in Wilbur 's case , as a cosmetologist . Thus , they were qualified to minister to the needs of the home 's residents , and the residents , in turn , met theirs . <p> Angie became the Halfacres ' particular favorite , chiefly because there was something unusually docile in the way she submitted to male sexual demands . That had been so with Roy , who had tried to encourage her to play a more active and responsive role in their conjugal relations . It was even more the case with the Halfacres , who had spent some time in custody in their teenage years for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no permanent record of that unfortunate episode , but during the time they spent in a supervised environment their shadows had became ascendant in their lives . That they should become employees in such a place as Raines Adult Home had been almost inevitable , shadows being drawn to other shadows in the way that insects swarm about light bulbs . If it had not been the home , it would have been one of the local prisons , or a school of Special Education . <p> Such were the Halfacres . For we may as well speak of their shadows as though they were the Halfacres , and of Angie 's shadow as though she and it were the same entity , for when a shadow has long been in command , the conventional boundaries between self and shadow blur and become unimportant . Who shall say that a particular crime was the work of someone 's shadow or her own ? More than once in her years at the home Angie 's shadow committed an opportunistic act of malice ( accidents are so common among the elderly ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to . Had her role ever been discovered , Angie could have protested that she was innocent , that she could not remember having released the switch or pulled the plug , and she might have passed a polygraph test when she testified to that effect . But increasingly Angie remembered nothing that she did , as her mind continued its long slow fade to gray . In such cases innocence becomes a semantic quibble , as it is so often in courts of law . <p> When shadows dominate those who are young and virile , like the Halfacres , their control has a different character than with someone like Angie . The shadows of the robust must give their hosts a freer rein , so that they can play an active role in the everyday world - at a job or a gym , on the highway , in a bar - and still be on call , as it were , for the shadow to command . These are the shadows who become momentarily notorious for some impulsive and seemingly motiveless crime , pushing a stranger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit of " road rage . " Working at the home , the shadows of the Halfacre boys had achieved a modus vivendi that made such extreme outbursts unnecessary . Like children taking ritalin or diabetics protected by insulin , the Halfacres got along from day to day with the calming assistance of their own private harem , among whom Angie , as the most recent arrival and sturdiest , figured as odalisque-in-chief , a golden-age and mute Scheherazade . <p> Even for a genuine Alzheimer 's victim , someone too out of it to resent having no other wardrobe than a blanket and adult diapers , the Adult Home might have seemed a sorry fate . Angie did have moments unattended by her shadow when she became conscious of the horror of her circumstances . Orville or Wilbur would be spooning cubes of Jell-O into her mouth ( to their credit , they kept their charges clean and wellnourished ) , and she would be overwhelmed by a sense of abasement that made it impossible to swallow the food . Tears would run down her heavily rouged cheeks ( Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice ) , and Wilbur would pause in his duties until the fit had passed and her feeding could resume . Surely , the oblivion of complete submission to her own shadow would have been preferred to such nightmare flickers of self-awareness . <p> As well to wish for death , however . Oblivion is never one of our options . Half of all Adult Homes would stand empty if one could just wish away unremitting misery and pain . Africa would be depopulated , along with all the prisons in Texas . <p> But who is to say there is no joy in Africa or in the prisons of Texas ? Or none in the life of Angie Sweetwater , at least in her life as a shadow ? She enjoyed good physical health , the attentions of two devoted admirers , and an uncommonly long life . When she was dressed for public display and it was her turn to be taken to a Sunday morning service at United Baptist , everyone agreed that Angie Sweetwater was the most presentable and best behaved of any of the visitors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the comfort she required . At other times she would remember what churches were for and she would fold her hands and pray for her deliverance . <p> And you must pray along with her , good people , and hope to die before the same thing happens to you . For it makes no difference whether you are rich or poor , a homeless beggar or an ex-president , like Ronald Reagan . Like Angie , we all have shadows . Stand in the light and you will see your own . <p> Author Affiliation
