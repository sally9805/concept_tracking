IN MID-JULY 1943 , the Chinese Ambassador to the United States formally communicated with the United States Secretary of State about a " Chinatown Opium Den " in New Haven , Connecticut . New Haven did not have a Chinatown . The town did boast , however , a self-proclaimed " World 's Museum ( Wax Figures ) . " Within weeks , a special agent of the Department of State paid a visit to this museum . Housed in a two-story frame building , the museum featured wax likenesses of noteworthy individuals . A customer would peer through an 18 by 10-inch window into a room about ten feet square . The special agent described what he saw : <p> There are two figures resembling white girls in separate booths , and four other booths each containing a figure resembling a Chinese man , all in reclining position with pipes resembling opium pipes inserted in their mouths . Alongside of one booth containing one of the girl figures , the figure of a Chinese man is kneeling , and in the center of the room is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The ambassador had expressed concern that this Chinatown exhibit " would tend to create among the American people an erroneous impression of the Chinese way of life . " ( n2 ) When confronted by the agent , the owner , a local mechanic , protested " he meant no harm " and promised to dismantle the exhibit immediately . <p> These incidents occurred in July and August of 1943 , at the height of United States ' government sponsored pro-Chinese propaganda and while the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization in Washington , D.C. debated the repeal of laws prohibiting individuals of Chinese descent from immigrating to the United States . This provocative and concurrent exhibit demonstrates that images of Chinese as immoral , depraved , and decadent remained vivid in the minds of some Americans . These same images had contributed to the moral subtext of the economic argument utilized against Chinese immigration in the late-nineteenth century , when Chinese exclusion had become law . The immediate involvement of the Department of State in shutting down a makeshift exhibit in a relatively out-of-the-way locale exemplifies the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sensitivity to domestic portrayals of its foreign allies . <p> Domestic policy and popular attitudes in the United States thus intersected with the aims of United States foreign policy in significant and often contradictory ways . The only complete study thus far of the organization of the campaign for repeal , historian Fred Riggs ' Pressures of Congress relied on information from the Citizens ' Committee for the Repeal of Chinese Exclusion , a private citizens lobbying group , and interviews with Congressmen . Because scholarly discussions of repeal have relied primarily on Riggs ' analysis , the specific role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration largely has been overlooked . Hence , most analyses have centered on the activities of private citizens and the Congressional debates focusing on popular opinion regarding China and Asians , but have not addressed the issue of domestic politics . This essay draws on the records of FDR and his administration , as well as those of American and Chinese diplomats . While scholars including Anne Choi , L. Ling-chi Wang , and Renqiu Liu recently have focused on the cooperation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion regarding repeal actually encompassed a wide variety of expectations , opinions , and political stances. ( n3 ) The importance of repeal to FDR as a presidential candidate involved more than foreign policy  --  his support for the bill also constituted an active response to public opinion at a time when his public approval figures were declining . At the same time , removing restrictions on Chinese immigration for diplomatic reasons could provoke a backlash among those Americans who favored repeal but still expressed hostility and prejudice against Chinese in the United States . <p> The Roosevelt administration 's strategy to push repeal legislation through Congress behind the scenes while negotiating many Americans ' ambivalence toward China and the Chinese , thus reveal the complex relationship between foreign policy , domestic public opinion , and race relations that shaped the discourse about repeal . The ways in which both the administration 's and private citizens ' campaigns excluded Chinese Americans from their repeal efforts further fractures notions of an American public . A brief exploration of white Euroamerican responses to the wartime alliance between China and the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations demonstrates how United States international and domestic policies inform each other . A similarly brief analysis of Chinese American responses to the repeal of Chinese Exclusion , the connections they made between patriotism and citizenship , and the manner in which their demonstrations of belonging to the United States during the war exceeded the definitions of belonging institutionalized through citizenship , further demonstrates how institutional responses can shape and be shaped by the responses of diverse communities within United States society . THE CHINESE QUESTION IN WARTIME <p> Wartime necessity produced the repeal of Chinese Exclusion in 1943 . Matters of foreign policy made it expedient both to embrace a national ideology of equality and to reject racist legislation that affected an ally. ( n4 ) As FDR himself emphasized , " there is just one front , which includes at home as well as abroad . It is all part of the picture of trying to win the war . " ( n5 ) Repeal required Roosevelt and his administration to negotiate the competing demands of foreign policy and domestic public opinion , the need to placate China as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The conspicuous tension between images of China versus images of Chinatowns , and of China as a nation-state versus the Chinese as a people , manifested itself throughout the debates over repealing Chinese Exclusion . While repeal purportedly removed racial discrimination from American immigration law , it did not directly confront American racism because it was not passed primarily for the benefit of Chinese Americans residing in the United States . Repeal legislation primarily represented a public gesture from one Allied Nation to another , and a response from one Allied Nation to an Axis enemy . Racism against " Asiatics " was as consistently expressed in the repeal of exclusion in 1943 as it was in the enactment of exclusion in 1882. ( n7 ) <p> FDR once described himself as a " Juggler " regarding foreign policy. ( n8 ) In the case of Chinese repeal , he and his administration maintained three political terrains at once : Republicans in Congress who were intent on challenging him every step of the way in 1943 ; a frustrated and wary Chinese Nationalist government ; and American public opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the war and into the postwar world , maintaining the confidence of the American public , and ultimately , winning the 1944 presidential election . <p> Throughout 1943 , as Congress debated whether or not to repeal Exclusion , relations with China continued to worsen . Promised supplies for China 's army rarely materialized , and continued requests for full Chinese participation in war strategy sessions of the Combined Chiefs of Staff were refused. ( n9 ) Particularly offensive to many Chinese government officials was the exclusion of Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek from the Casablanca conference with Churchill and FDR . As one high-ranking Chinese official complained , " It 's just another proof that it 's an American-Anglo war , with the idea of American-Anglo psychology and superiority predominating . " ( n10 ) An advisor at the Department of State warned that China might become alienated from the United States and " turn to Russia or even Japan for the purposes of a ' best friend ' relationship . " ( n11 ) The repeal of exclusion provided one way of easing relations with China and diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia  --  a possibility that concerned Roosevelt and Congress . Indeed , numerous Chinese officials requested that exclusion be repealed . Allowing Chinese citizens entry on the same quota basis as European nations would be one indication that the United States regarded China as an equal . FOREIGN RELATIONS ON THE HOME FRONT : REPEAL AND THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN <p> Yet , the repeal of Chinese exclusion proved most politically advantageous for FDR on the home front . Working with Congress proved to be difficult after the mid-term election of 1942 , in which the Democrats lost a number of seats in both houses . Republicans attempted to capitalize on public fears that the White House was overlooking domestic concerns  --  namely Americans ' reluctance about paying for a " foreign war " and concerns about job security after war  --  in favor of foreign policy. ( n12 ) A survey of foreign affairs in 1942 suggested that the American " people are almost twice as much interested in domestic affairs as international affairs , " and especially resisted foreign aid should it diminish the standard of living within the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an apparent resurgence of isolationism among Americans by criticizing FDR 's war strategy. ( n14 ) In 1943 , China gained powerful support by uniting Republican Congressmen who supported China , with those who sought to undermine the President and critique his foreign policy and still others who remained deeply resistant to aiding Russia as a matter of ideological difference. ( n15 ) Simultaneously , Democratic leaders expressed concern over the president 's ability to demonstrate leadership in both domestic and foreign affairs. ( n16 ) <p> Americans ' romance with China during the war had not gone unnoticed by the politically savvy Roosevelt . During 1942 discussions regarding aid for China , the President confided to Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau , " I think that it is popular to help the Chinese . " ( n17 ) Madame Chiang 's visit to the United States in early 1943 inspired further public favor for China based on the common enemy the United States and China shared in Japan . Much of the public had always been somewhat grudging in its support of the " Hitler First " policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she continually stressed the need to focus on the Pacific front further challenged Roosevelt 's foreign policy objectives. ( n18 ) <p> Simultaneously presidential aides anticipated the 1944 presidential election with concern . Special Assistant to the President and presidential speechwriter Samuel I. Rosenman described the Republicans as having gone " on a rampage " at the end of the first session , potentially undermining public confidence in the President . Thus Rosenman advised FDR to take the initiative in proposing legislation during the upcoming session . " The legislation should be the kind which would receive immediate popular approval so that the Congress could not very well ignore the recommendations by you for its enactment . " ( n19 ) Rosenman specifically suggested that FDR put himself in the position to take credit for the repeal of Chinese Exclusion. ( n20 ) Subsequent reports prepared for Rosenman by the Departments of Justice and State show that the administration was much more involved in the attempt to pass repeal legislation than has been suggested previously by Fred Riggs. ( n21 ) By August , Rosenman received regular updates on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not clear what FDR thought personally of the bill , but in supporting this bill FDR conspicuously confronted public criticisms of his foreign policy and ameliorated some tension between China and the United States over the conduct of the war . The administration closely monitored the progress of the bill from June onward and even commissioned a public opinion poll in October , the results of which demonstrated public support for the repeal . In a national survey of 1200 conducted by the Office of Public Opinion Research during the last two weeks of October 1943 , a 65% majority favored repeal and 26% did not . This report also noted that support was as strong in the western states as it was in the east . The greatest opposition was from the southern states , corresponding with the opposition to repeal legislation in Congress from southern representatives. ( n22 ) This suggests that public opinion regarding China ( although not necessarily the Chinese people ) was just as crucial to the repeal of exclusion as were the demands of the Chinese government for recognition within the American polity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify itself with a bill that could possibly fail and cause further tension in United States relations with China has already been noted by Riggs. ( n23 ) It could also prove to be a public embarrassment for FDR and further undermine his leadership . The difficulty of repeal legislation was that it involved immigration policy , an issue related to both United States foreign and domestic policy , and one that illustrated the social and cultural complexities Americans confronted during the war . <p> Ostensibly a wartime measure , repeal of Chinese Exclusion was significant because it would at least symbolically redefine in the words of Keith Fitzgerald , " the face of the nation . " ( n24 ) One policy pundit put it this way : immigration policy was both " an organic part of foreign relations , " and a domestic issue determined by " prejudices held by the public at large and their elected representatives . " ( n25 ) As Ronald Takaki , Roger Daniels , Harold Isaacs , and other scholars have argued , prejudice against " Asiatics " had not abated during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by the Japanese and the best were represented by the Chinese. ( n26 ) The shift was also noticeable along the color spectrum as well . A " Terry and the Pirates " comic strip entitled " How to Spot a Jap " explained that the Japanese complexion was " yellow " and the Chinese complexion was more " bronze . " ( n27 ) <p> Some Americans were increasingly aware of this divergence of nationality and race . The discrepancy in itself was complicated . Befriending China and to an extent Korea , the Philippines , and India  --  and yet opposing Japan  --  necessitated a reevaluation of Americans ' notions of an " Asiatic " race . FDR professed hope that Chiang Kai-shek would lead the post-war Asian sphere of influence based on democratic ideals , not race . At the same time , fears of pan-Asian unity against the United States and its European allies fed into United States support of China . The possibility that Japan might succeed in its attempts to unify Asian countries on the basis of race was plausible enough to increase some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this racial awareness on the part of certain bureaucrats and some civilians already was increasing even prior to Madame Chiang 's visit . FIGHTING THE WAR AT HOME : THE EFFECTS OF JAPANESE PROPAGANDA ON AMERICAN RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS <p> For example , in May , 1942 , the Augusta , Georgia Post Office delivered a letter from the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company to the Pine Manufacturing Company in Meridian Mississippi . On 11 May 1942 , the envelope in which the letter had been delivered arrived at the " State Dept , Washington , D.C. For Mr. Secty Cordell Hull . " A. D. Burdette of the Burdette Lumber Company wrote in the accompanying note , " I do n't think this use of " yellow " is a good idea . Let 's not promote the race and color lines . " Burdette was referring to the rubber stamp with which the Augusta Post Office had stamped its own patriotic war message : " ***Help Sound " TAPS " for the " YELLOW " Japs*** " . <p> Secretary of State Hull received the envelope and message on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message to the Postmaster General Frank C. Walter. ( n28 ) Hull described in detail for Walter 's benefit the Department of State 's recommendation that the OSS attempt to limit the use of " yellow " or " brown " by members of the American media in describing the Japanese " because of the applicability of such terms also to the Chinese , the Filipinos , and other of our Asiatic associates and friends who may be seriously offended thereby . " Hull enclosed for Walter 's perusal this memo of 8 January 1942 , and a Department of State memorandum written on the subject of these " terms of opprobrium and derogation . " ( n29 ) Also in 1942 , another concerned citizen wrote to Lowell Mellett , Head of the Motion Picture Bureau branch of the Office of War Information . Marcus S. Goldstein at the University of Texas in Austin suggested that a series of " Short , interesting , effective films " could be made of the various branches of the Armed Service , " subtly , effectively , stressing the unselfish , patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forging of unity and teamwork so essential in waging war ( and peace , too ) . " He wanted the government to emphasize that whatever their race , " men with black , various shades of white , or yellow skin , but under the skin , all Americans were fighting for one common cause . " ( n30 ) <p> These exchanges reveal some Americans ' increasing awareness of the potential for race to color the conflict between Japan and the United States . Goldstein 's concern with the " unity among the several racial and ethnic groups in the country " further indicates the extent to which some Americans perceived racial divisions as disruptive to the war effort . Both citizens ' appeals to the United States government also emphasize the shifting expectations of the federal government 's role in maintaining a diverse national community. ( n31 ) A State Department document , " Informal Comments on Suggested China Plan of Psychological Warfare , " discussed in part how American treatment of Chinese in the United States could easily be misconstrued as Americans ' view of China as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful effort could be exerted to eliminate some of the forms of discrimination which Chinese in this country suffer . " ( n32 ) They deplored the fact that high-ranking Chinese officials often were denied housing based on their race . Clearly , several officials within the Department of State already understood the seriousness of domestic race relations for foreign policy . <p> Stanley K. Hornbeck , political advisor of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs within the Department of State , extensively sought to heighten consciousness of race and its role in the waging of the war . He assumed the power of the media to shape public opinion , specifically in presenting the conflict with Japan in racial terms . Japanese propaganda portrayed the Japanese as leading the effort in " expelling the white man from the Far East . " The use of racial terms in United States reports of the war might substantiate Japan 's claims of Anglo-American disregard for other racial groups . Hornbeck urged that the Office of the Coordinator of Information and the Office of the National Censor  --  both wartime offices  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " adjectives ' yellow ' and ' brown ' in referring to the Japanese and to avoid employing any expression which would tend to place our hatred of Japanese barbarism on a racial basis . " As Hornbeck explained , the Chinese and other potential allies  --  the Mongols , Siberian tribes , and Cambodians  --  also fell within the category of " yellow . " Filipinos , Thais , and the natives of the East Indies " are also brown peoples . " His desire for increased official sensitivity was threefold : to allay any potential misunderstandings among allies , to defuse Japanese propaganda throughout Asia about a pan-Asian identity , and to distinguish United States ideology in practice from the racism exhibited by Nazi Germany. ( n33 ) <p> Hornbeck also suggested more positive portrayals of other Asiatics to counter Japanese propaganda ; he specifically suggested that the media publicize the numbers of Chinese in the United States armed forces and their " character , " as well as the gallantry of the Filipinos fighting the Japanese . Hombeck urged that more publicity be given to " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future Filipinos to European and American civilization " and that emphasis be placed upon upcoming Filipino independence in 1946. ( n34 ) Japanese propaganda placed American racism into a broader international context , and brought a " domestic " issue into the full purview of an international gaze . Broadcasts from Tokyo attempted to represent the war as a conflict based on racial division , with Japan as the champion of non-white peoples. ( n35 ) Power relations were presented as a difference of color : " whites , " or Euro-Americans , possessed greater power through the oppression of " nonwhites . " If and when the European-American alliance won the war , the balance of power would remain the same . The peoples of Africa and Asia would remain subjugated to continued imperial exploitation by the ruling white class as represented by European nations and the United States . <p> Historians of Chinese America have noted that Japan 's race propaganda directed at other Asian communities provided a strong incentive for Congress to pass the bill outlawing Exclusion. ( n36 ) Excerpts provided from intercepted Japanese broadcasts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line in the war . These broadcasts described the humiliating treatment and detention of Chinese at United States immigration stations , reminded listeners that " the Chinese are rigidly excluded from attaining American citizenship by naturalization , a right which is accorded to the lowliest immigrant from Europe " and further emphasized how Chinese were " despised and mistreated and at best patronizingly tolerated with a contemptuous humor " in American society. ( n37 ) On the second day of the committee hearings on repeal , in fact , Tokyo broadcast a message that the hearings were " a mere gesture ; if the United States really believed in equality ... it would have repealed the exclusion laws long ago . " ( n38 ) <p> The effectiveness of Japanese propaganda no doubt bolstered the bill 's appeal to a broader constituency , some of whom did not necessarily support China . In 1943 debates over the future of the domestic branch of the Office of War Information , Congressmen expressed an awareness that the American public was very resistant to anything that appeared to be propaganda , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n39 ) Thus the repeal measure may have gained that much more public support as a response to Japanese propaganda , and not necessarily as pro-Chinese propaganda in and of itself . <p> This tension between perceptions of China as a nation and Chinese as members of an " Asiatic race " manifested itself in the debate over the provisions of the bill . The Magnuson bill proposed ending the Chinese Exclusion Laws , which were the first federal immigration laws to specifically deny naturalized citizenship based on race ( and set precedent for further exclusion of persons from the " Asiatic Barred Zone " in 1917 ) . It further allowed Chinese to become naturalized American citizens and thus opened the door for Chinese to enter the United States under the provisions of the National Origins Act of 1924 . <p> The question of American citizenship for persons of Chinese descent , then , involved discussion of whether Americans wanted Chinese not only as their friends across the Pacific , but as neighbors across the fence in their own communities . While most Americans widely acknowledged the desirability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were much more hesitant to welcome Chinese into the American national community. ( n40 ) A repeal bill in fact had been tabled at the end of the first session in June 1943 , because a majority of the House Committee agreed on the necessity of ending Exclusion , but not on allowing Chinese to enter the United States under the quota system. ( n41 ) Cognizant of this sentiment , the Citizens Committee working to pass the bill continually emphasized that repeal would allow only a minimum number of Chinese immigrants to enter the country while providing an important gesture of respect for China . THE LIMITS OF INCLUSION : INSTITUTIONALIZING AMERICAN AMBIVALENCE TOWARD THE CHINESE <p> Images of China during the war did not dispel racial stereotypes . Numerous studies of American attitudes towards nationality and race stereotypes were conducted during the war . One of these studies , " Summaries of attitudes toward countries considered as post-war problems , " based its report on papers written by American subjects about other nations at the end of war . Twenty-four of these papers were about China . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others treated them as trusting children . <p> All agreed that they were courageous , peace-loving , backward and uncivilized needing the United States and or the United Nations aid in developing their educational possibilities , sanitary conditions and religious training . At all times they were spoken about as inferiors to be treated kindly whether as heathen ; THE WORTHY POOR ; stupid , industrious children or retarded adults with latent possibilities. ( n42 ) <p> Furthermore , the report noted that Americans ' attitudes towards China were utilitarian : " China can be useful as an ally if there is a future war , in trade and as a bulwark in the Far East . " Finally , a sense of international responsibility also manifested itself : the U.S. " owed " China for the lack of wartime support it had provided , as well as for having sold raw materials to Japan . In contrast to attitudes towards China , American attitudes towards the Allies tended to view France , Finland , and Great Britain as equal to the United States . <p> This positive yet paternalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese residing within the United States . Wartime surveys on national and minority stereotypes conducted among high schoolers in Ohio , and faculty , students and staff at Vassar College throughout 1942 and 1943 , illuminate the perceived distinction between China as a nation versus the Chinese as a race : " Where the nationalities listed are rated presumably as foreigners in their own countries the Chinese draw the " most friendly " rating ... whether rated as " country " or as " people . " But Chinese as a minority group within the United States were ranked among the lowest five of the eighteen groups : in ascending order these were Japanese , blacks , Communists , Chinese and Mexicans. ( n43 ) <p> These continued negative perceptions of Chinese manifested themselves in policy discussions about how to repeal restrictions without opening the doors to large numbers of Chinese . Many American officials expressed concern that once Chinese were allowed to enter the country , it was possible that Chinese in Western hemisphere countries not limited to quotas might enter : a person of Chinese descent from Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for China . Hence , the ways in which Americans imagined Chinese  --  as a community exceeding China 's geopolitical borders yet remaining intrinsically Chinese  --  had significant implications for any revision in the exclusion laws . <p> The Office of the Geographer within the State Department proposed a number of formulas to define an immigrant as Chinese without making reference to race , and to keep all incoming immigration of Chinese within the quota specifically allotted to China as a nation . Language was offered as one marker of geopolitical origin , even if the immigrant resided elsewhere . A proposed mother tongue distinction , for example , was specifically proposed to maintain limits on Chinese immigration . Although this proposal was not implemented , the " mother tongue " distinction reveals how some officials sought to maintain policies of racial discrimination without making specific reference to " race " or " nationality . " ( n44 ) Geographer S.W. Boggs suggested that " if the mother tongue of the immigrant is not that of the country in which he resides , the immigrant shall be charged to the quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrant ancestor was born. ( n45 ) Explaining how " the mother tongue " requirement would solve the potential " Chinese problem , " Boggs wrote " all persons of Chinese mother tongue coming from countries in which the Chinese constituted less than 10% of the population in 1920 would be charged against the quota of China . " ( n46 ) Within a couple of months , the proposed formulas were changed to reflect national population figures in the base year of 1880 . Because even fewer Chinese resided in countries other than China in 1880 , the majority of Chinese , regardless of where they presently lived would be counted against China 's quota. ( n47 ) <p> The debate over allowing Chinese entry into the United States also reveals much about the class-based perceptions of who belonged and who did not in the national community . Many editorials in major United States newspapers drew careful distinction between the New China and its respectable citizens who would henceforth be allowed entry , and the Old China and its immoral , impoverished masses which had been excluded . The wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal lurid details of Chinatown life , exemplified this negative view of the Chinese living in America . These perceptions of Chinese Americans ( whether immigrants or native born ) also were echoed by the Danburg News-Times , which noted in its support of repeal that some Chinese who lived in Chinatowns were " as completely immersed in Chinese atmosphere as if they had remained in China ... knowing neither the language nor customs of this country " and would not become American citizens. ( n48 ) " On the other hand , " the editorial observed , China itself had " thousands of Chinese who are modern , well educated , intelligent , who will make excellent citizens . " Opining that exclusion was not the " historic mistake " that FDR proclaimed it to be , the writer explained , " We were not getting the cream of the Chinese , back in those days , but the lowest of the coolies . " ( n49 ) <p> Several editorials emphasized the significance of granting citizenship to Chinese in terms of maintaining the integrity of the American creed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans ' condemnation of Hitler 's super-race and Japanese " Asia for Asiatics " rhetoric . Goaded by Japanese propaganda that emphasized American and European notions of racial superiority through immigration restrictions and colonialism in India and other countries , many Americans now perceived the necessity of displaying more consistently their national ideology of equality . <p> Yet , even while insisting Americans were not as prejudiced as the Axis powers , an equally provocative argument for repeal was based on the potential effects of a " Japonized " Asiatic population . This is evident in the following testimony by a private citizen at the congressional hearings : " If they Japonize the Chinese , you ... are going to think that the gates of hell have been left ajar . If they ever succeed in Japonizing the Chinese and the Hindus , the white race is through . " ( n50 ) Ironically , then , the same argument in support of exclusion laws in the nineteenth century was now offered in support of the repeal of those very laws in the twentieth century : the white race then feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American society . In the wake of 1941 , however , the white race was now threatened by two-thirds of the world 's population potentially being " japonized . " Asian populations , inherently less civilized , might additionally acquire the " modernization " boosted by Japan. ( n51 ) The alternative was to " Americanize " or " democratize " the Asiatics first . <p> Citizenship for persons of Chinese descent ( who would prove through citizenship tests their eligibility to be patriotic and loyal Americans ) paralleled FDR 's promises of full participation in the post-war world to China . China 's contribution to the global union of nations was signified through Chinese citizens ' access to America , the self-proclaimed nation of nations . China 's economic potential , further indicating viability as a nation , also was linked to practical United States domestic concerns . A member of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce testified that China 's market " could absorb our surplus goods , keep our factories going , and furnish jobs for returning soldiers . " ( n52 ) THE PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS OF REPEAL <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress in favor of reversing exclusion . Rosenman wrote the draft of this statement , and Roosevelt edited it himself as he did most of his speeches . These changes suggest how the president himself viewed the repeal legislation . The first draft that focused on race and equality was not used . Instead , the draft that Roosevelt edited discussed China as a nation and the mistakes the United States had made as a nation . Significantly , he added two sections . The first addressed the opposition voiced by the American Federation of Labor and other groups that Chinese immigrants would undermine American labor . " There can be no reasonable apprehension " he firmly stated , " that any such number of immigrants will cause unemployment or provide competition in the search for jobs . " ( n53 ) Roosevelt doubly politicized the small number of immigrants who would enter annually . In addition to calming the fears of labor interests at home , he also justified the quota to any foreign critics , such as the Japanese propagandists , on the basis of domestic political considerations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for China in the postwar world and the preference of Chinese over other Asiatics who were still omitted from immigration. ( n54 ) Extending citizenship to " the relatively few Chinese residents in our country " was " additional proof that we regard China not only as a partner in waging war but that we shall regard her as a partner in days of peace . " Even though the legislation would " give the Chinese a preferred status over other Oriental people , their great contribution to the cause of decency and freedom entitles them to such preference . " ( n55 ) Roosevelt emphasized that America 's national values , decency and freedom , were values shared by Chinese . These shared values justified the full political participation of Chinese in the American community , or at least the 105 persons a year who would be allowed in . <p> With little reference to Chinese born in the United States and domestic racist attitudes towards Asian Americans , the Roosevelt White House and the private Citizens ' Committee were able to persuade many Americans that repeal was a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign policy prevailed over popular racial prejudice towards Asians in the repeal of the Exclusion Laws. ( n56 ) Although a majority of Americans did not favor an increase in immigrants , particularly from Asia , international diplomacy proved persuasive . Certain labor unions , including the AFL and nationalist groups such as the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Affairs , strongly opposed any quotas for Chinese immigrants for economic reasons. ( n57 ) Arrayed against these interests were pro-business groups , which anticipated 400 million consumers after the war , liberals who viewed repeal as one step towards racial equality , and old China hands who claimed China 's affinity with the United States on the basis of Christianity . The president 's articulation of repeal as a measure for the purposes of national security effectively redefined repeal as a matter of foreign policy . <p> Roosevelt , by supporting the Magnuson bill to repeal Chinese exclusion , was thus able to satisfy the demands of the Chinese government and demonstrate political leadership in getting a bill passed without extended political struggle. ( n58 ) The Citizens Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president 's message " did more than influence Congress directly . It emboldened the faint of heart among newspapers , so that editorials for repeal began appearing in the papers which ... had been silent on the subject . " ( n59 ) The success of this political strategy was noted by Rosenman . " By taking the leadership on even minor things , like the repeal of the Chinese exclusion legislation , the President has gotten a very favorable press throughout the country on his leadership . " ( n60 ) Oscar Cox , the Assistant Solicitor General wrote Rosenman two weeks later , " You do n't know what you started with the message on the repeal . ... we are still looking for an editorial that opposes the repeal . Also , the letters to the President which have been referred over here ... are 100% behind him . " ( n61 ) By minimizing the amount of change , Roosevelt was able to allay domestic resistance to Chinese inclusion and accommodate domestic racism against Asians , while yet maintaining the myth of American equality for all. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law the Magnuson bill , which repealed Chinese Exclusion with three results : it officially ended Chinese Exclusion , allowed Chinese in the United States to become naturalized citizens , and placed the immigration of persons immigrating to the United States from China on a quota basis. ( n63 ) More significantly , particularly for those groups opposed to repeal , this law established the precedent of allowing an Asian national group into the United States . <p> A number of Chinese Americans , not surprisingly , perceived repeal in more personal terms . Racial issues , and not solely Chinese nationalism , contributed to what the FBI reported as Chinese Americans ' deep dissatisfaction with Congress 's handling of repeal legislation . One FBI report speculated that the increasing publicity surrounding the repeal legislation had heightened race consciousness among Chinese communities . " The racial implications in this proposed legislation have increased race consciousness among the Chinese and they are inclined to believe that , regardless of the outcome of the war , the white races intend to continue to exploit the ' dark skinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this viewpoint echoed Japanese propaganda , but he did not inquire why Japanese propaganda might have found resonance with certain members of the Chinese American community , as well as other minority groups . Although FBI reports can not be assumed to represent all , or even a majority of Chinese Americans because they primarily focused on potential threats to America 's war effort , several reports do record individual Chinese Americans ' perspectives , as well as the doubts felt by some government officials regarding ethnic immigrant communities ' loyalties to the United States over their homelands during the war . <p> The dual affiliation of immigrants with the United States and their ancestral lands led to a crisis of identities for the American government during the war . The linking of race and nationality in the popular imagination is evidenced in policy decisions made during the war , most notoriously the assumed loyalty of Japanese Americans to the Japanese emperor . This justified removing Japanese Americans from the West Coast ( and Canada and South America ) for security reasons , and caused the United States government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan . The Department of State maintained numerous files on ethnic communities during the war . Activities sponsored by the government such as " I am an American " Day , for example , sought to unite the various ethnic groups under the themes of patriotism and an American national identity . This fear of disloyalty based on ethnic identification also is evident in the FBI reports of the activities of the Chinese , and other groups including Norwegians and Swedes . <p> The ambiguous relationship between national loyalty and ethnic heritage was not limited to the United States . The Chinese Nationalist government similarly assumed that Chinese descent correlated with participation and belonging in the Chinese Nationalist community , and actively recruited Chinese Americans with technical skills to return to China . In fact , the Chinese Nationalist ( Kuomingtang or KMT ) government continued to view overseas Chinese as an integral part of its community and Chinese Americans themselves saw China as an alternative to the prejudice in the United States. ( n65 ) FBI reports detail the KMT 's pressure on overseas Chinese to support the KMT cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the Department of State considered the Chinese American population to be an important part of its campaign to maintain cooperative and effective relations with China . A further example of the ambiguous jurisdiction over Chinese in America was the issue of selective service . The Chinese Nationalist government had early on proposed that an army of American Chinese be trained in Hawaii to fight under Chinese command . But the United States government never enacted that suggestion . When it came to issues like labor , the American government apparently was reluctant to give up its own jurisdiction . When it came to issues like culture and national loyalty , however , the belief persisted that the actions of Americans of Chinese descent might be determined by virtue of their race . NEITHER HERE NOR THERE : LOCATING THE CHINESE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN RELATION TO REPEAL <p> The Chinese American community , as with any other community , was not homogeneous and in fact was as widely diverse and fragmented along political , socioeconomic , and cultural lines as American society in general . Calls for loyalty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity . Tensions existed between Chinese who had been born in the United States , or had lived a long time in the states , and Chinese nationals . A number of Americanized Chinese felt little connection to China , and , according to FBI informants , expressed resentment that leadership within American communities had been taken over by leadership with strong KMT tendencies. ( n67 ) Others remained closely supportive of China , even supporting FDR 's 1944 re-election based on his pro-China wartime policies. ( n68 ) At the same time , because the United States strongly supported the Nationalist government , pressure may have been exerted on Chinese Americans to purchase war bonds for Nationalist China as well as for the United States as a material way of proving one 's loyalty to both countries . <p> Diverse perceptions of " Chinese " and " Chinese American " converged in mainstream assumptions that Chinese were " all the same , " and this sameness was that Chinese were different from ( white , European ) Americans . The repeal of exclusion generated popular discussion and manifested popular support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared by Chinese Americans-whether they were born in the United States or China , whether Communist or Nationalist or simply pro-United States , whether rich or poor . Racial discrimination cut across the lines of ideology , gender and class , and thus united disparate interests within a community of persons excluded from equal treatment within the American community . This discrimination however , did not inspire unified support for equality across racial lines . <p> While some Chinese Americans may have supported equal rights for all Americans whether of Chinese , Japanese or African descent , the efforts of Chinese officials in the United States solely focused on gaining rights for the Chinese . For example , the Chinese Consul sought to intervene in a case of racial discrimination in Mississippi on behalf of those perceived to be his Chinese constituents , but not on behalf of nonwhites or persons who were not considered " full " Chinese . Tentative inquiries made by the Chinese embassy into the situation of Chinese excluded from white schools in Mississippi under segregation reveal that the Chinese government still considered the treatment of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On 21 April 1944 , Mr. Victor Kwong of the Chinese Embassy contacted Mr. Perkins at the State Department , desiring " to bring to our attention informally and as a possible preliminary to a formal approach the matter of the exclusion of children of Chinese race from white schools in Mississippi . " ( n69 ) Kwong expressed his assumption that Mississippi was the only state to classify Chinese as non-whites , citing a test case in Texas where Chinese were not to be considered as non-whites . <p> The Chinese officials apparently opposed Chinese being categorized as non-white , particularly because of the association of Chinese therefore with blacks . The embassy was aware that any effort to distinguish treatment of Chinese from treatment of blacks in Mississippi might have the adverse effect of associating the two ethnic minority groups in the public discourse of race and discrimination . Thus , the embassy was " loath to take action which would tend to associate Chinese in the public eye with the negro race question in the South . " ( n70 ) Rather , Kwong 's hope was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " point out to them the adverse effect of such discrimination on our good relations with a friendly nation and an ally in the war , in the hope that remedial action might be taken without causing public controversy . " ( n71 ) In order to maintain the clarity of boundaries of race and national identities , Kwong also added that the Chinese embassy wished to intervene on behalf of " fullblooded Chinese only " as opposed to persons of mixed blood . The State Department official noted that " some Chinese apparently have taken wives of negro blood . " ( n72 ) <p> The informal nature of this inquiry again illustrates the ambiguous jurisdiction concerning Chinese in the United States . Maintaining the exclusive connection of race and nation was difficult when both countries could and did claim authority in matters pertaining to Chinese who were American by birth , and who also might be considered Chinese nationals under Chinese law . Indeed , the Department of State ultimately decided that the matter of segregation and racial discrimination could " not properly be raised by the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n73 ) The department would only act upon an official complaint raised by the embassy that concerned discriminatory treatment of Chinese officials when they traveled through Mississippi . The fact that Chinese Americans were American by birth placed them outside of the Chinese government 's attempts to urge more equal treatment and under the jurisdiction of a federal government that had and would continue to tolerate blatant segregation and racial discrimination . <p> At the same time , the desire for the Chinese government to be dissociated racially in any way with blacks suggests that racism was an equal component in this concern over segregation in the south . Specifically , the issue was not that of equality of all races , but of placing Chinese on an equal basis as whites and disassociating them from blacks ; certain officials representing the Chinese government apparently assumed that Chinese were better than blacks and thus deserved to be treated differently . The pressure from China for the repeal of exclusion , then , was not so much a confrontation of racism in general but more a discussion of how to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and elites were willing to affirm America 's leadership role and overlook continued racism so long as Chinese were nominally excluded from the category of being an " unacceptable " Asiatic. ( n74 ) <p> The debate over the repeal of Chinese Exclusion indicated the difficulties facing an American government that sought to affirm ties with its allies during the war in a society that continued to define itself in part by race . As the United States took on a global role , based upon a perceived moral basis , domestic policy also had to be consistent with that moral position . The role of United States in world politics directly affected Americans as well . Immigration scholars also consistently have noted that the treatment of immigrant communities corresponds to the power of the nation-state in world politics and in relation to the United States. ( n75 ) Ling-Chi Wang 's study of the politics of repeal provides crucial insight into the ways in which relations between nation-states can easily eclipse the needs and goals of the immigrant communities involved . Both United States and Chinese governments overlooked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial oppression " and " extraterritorial domination " by both governments. ( n76 ) <p> Many Chinese Americans nonetheless claimed repeal as their issue . Despite attempts by The Citizens Committee to Repeal Exclusion and the FDR administration to minimize visible Chinese American participation in campaigning for repeal , the Chinese American community actively pursued repeal legislation in Congress. ( n77 ) Chinese American organizations publicized the issue within the Chinese American community . The Chinese Benevolent Association of New York reportedly sent " more than five hundred telegrams to members of Congress and prominent political leaders asking them to assist in obtaining its repeal . " ( n78 ) A full-page ad in the September 10 , 1943 issue of The Chinese Press sponsored by " friends of China and Advocates of Justice " called for the newspaper 's English-reading subscribers to " WRITE , WIRE , Your CONGRESSMAN Today Asking Him To Support the REPEAL of the Chinese Exclusion ACT ! " ( n79 ) The ad provided directions for contacting the list of Congressmen in districts " most populated by Chinese . " Notably , the " Suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not mention the treatment of Chinese in America , again asking Chinese Americans to emphasize their national as opposed to racial identities . By writing their representatives , Chinese Americans were exercising their influence and demanding representation of Chinese American interests . World War II thus allowed Chinese Americans to act upon their affiliations with China in a thoroughly American way . <p> Even though the campaign strategy for repeal clearly had an international focus , many Chinese Americans understood what was at stake for themselves . The FBI 's " General Intelligence Survey in the United States " for July 1943 discussed the Chinese communities ' responses to the Kennedy repeal bill under " Racial Matters , " an entire subheading within the " Chinese Activities " section . Communities in Hawaii and Chicago both had shown " a good deal of enthusiasm " and " considerable interest " in the topic of citizenship for Chinese . Hawaiian Chinese , according to the report , had been writing letters to government officials urging their support for this measure . In Chicago , " the opinion often has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and are fighting for the same principles , the barriers against them should be removed . " One Chinese FBI informant questioned why a Chinese American would enlist . " Look at what the American Legion and the labor people are doing about the Exclusion Act . How can the Chinese feel that he 's fighting for something when he is n't even welcome . " ( n80 ) Yet , Chinese American men 's enrollment in the Armed Forces , and Chinese American women 's enrollment in the auxiliary services , suggest that some in the Chinese American community asserted their patriotism to the United States despite exclusion. ( n81 ) <p> The passage of repeal was bittersweet . " Practically all the Chinese contacted " in San Francisco by FBI agent Jesse Wagner viewed repeal as an indication of favorable public opinion towards the Chinese and improved relations between the United States and China. ( n82 ) Specifically , they expressed hope that these apparent developments would result in decreased racial discrimination in business and further advantages for Chinese in America . Wagner also noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the definite impression that the repeal ... was in itself only a gesture and does little to improve the lot of the Chinese . " ( n83 ) Walter Lum , editor of the Chinese Times stated in the report that " Only those alien Chinese who were in the United Stated before 1924 can become naturalized at present . " ( n84 ) Because repeal nominally placed China under the conditions of the National Origins Act of 1924 , Chinese who had come since 1924 could not qualify , and would have to leave the United States and attempt to enter under the yearly quota. ( n85 ) <p> The year 1943 seemed promising for Chinese Americans with the popularity of China and the repeal of Chinese Exclusion , yet the results were decidedly ambiguous . The response of many Chinese Americans to this grudging gesture of inclusion further affirms that , while identity and belonging may be defined for the government by those who possess political power , individual and even community expressions of identity and belonging are not necessarily contained within those definitions . Repeal provided an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their desire to participate fully in the civic culture of the national community . San Francisco resident Mansie Chow told Agent Wagner that " many Chinese who are not eligible for naturalization are none the less sic going to apply for naturalization papers so that the government will realize that they really do desire to become citizens . Chinese who can be naturalized are being urged to secure their papers as proof of good intent . " ( n86 ) Not settling for the symbolic compromise reached by both governments , neither of which fully ( or even legitimately , in the case of the Nationalist government ) represented the Chinese American community , some Chinese Americans engaged in symbolic acts of their own . Thus , the potential for changes in legislation , discrimination , and self-perception exceeded the limits of the actual repeal law itself . <p> Although he had adeptly juggled party politics , foreign policy , and public opinion , Franklin D. Roosevelt dropped the ball of race relations in his attempt to appease both a wartime ally in China and a fickle public that sought assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever insistent issue of race relations was itself a political strategy . The Chinese American community was not the public to whom FDR answered . The spectrum of politics involved in repeal suggests that discussion of the United States ' foreign policy toward China can not be easily divorced from the everyday experiences of Chinese living in America , just as American race relations can not be fully comprehended without examining the United States in relation to other nations . Although both foreign and domestic policy are set at the institutional level , their mutually dynamic relationship with American public opinion allows us to understand more deeply how diverse Americans made sense of who they were as citizens and what they represented as a national community in 1943 , at the height of the war . The exploration of the Repeal of Chinese Exclusion from the standpoint of a President seeking to build consensus in both domestic and foreign policy , without disturbing too deeply existing racial divides , reveals the complexities of power and how it is organized , distributed , and perpetuated in American society not only through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnicity , and nationality . <p>
