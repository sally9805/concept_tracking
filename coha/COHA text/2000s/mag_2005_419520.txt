( Excerpt from James Lee Burke 's new novel , Crusader 's Cross ) " That evening I stood outside my bedroom window , staring at the indentations sculpted into my flower bed . Were these from the workboots of the Baton Rouge serial killer ? I called Mack Bertrand , our forensic chemist , at his home . " Can you make some casts in my flower bed ? " I said . " We 're a little backed up , but , yeah , what d ' you got , Dave ? " he said . " Maybe just a Peeping Tom . " " Can you be a little more forthcoming ? " " I interviewed the latest serial killer 's victim shortly before she was killed . Maybe the guy knows me . " Mack was quiet a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have sounded . But Mack was always a gentleman . " We 'll get it done first thing in the morning , podna , " he said . That night I placed flowers on Bootsie 's tomb in St. Martinville . The bayou was black , wrinkled with wind , bladed by moonlight . I sat for a long time on the steel bench in the darkness , saying nothing to Bootsie , not even thinking thoughts she might hear . Then I walked to the old church in the square , pressed a folded five-dollar bill into the poor box , and returned with a votive candle burning inside a small blue vessel . I heard a flapping of wings overhead , but could see no birds in flight . Then I told Bootsie about Molly and me . I believe the dead have voice and inhabit the earth as surely as we do . I believe they speak in our dreams or inside the sound of rain or even in the static of a telephone call , on the other side of which there is no caller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt an intolerable sense of guilt about the affair I had embarked upon with Molly Boyle . I not only felt I had betrayed Bootsie , I could no longer deny I was creating scandal for Molly as well as for my church . My rationalizations of my behavior left me exhausted in the morning and agitated during the day . " What should I do , Boots ? " I said . But there was no answer . On another occasion when I had visited her grave , I had seen two brown pelicans floating on the bayou , farther inland than I had seen pelicans since my childhood . On that day Bootsie had spoken to me . Her voice and her presence were as real as if she had sat beside me , clasped my hand , and looked directly into my face . She said that one day the pelicans would return to Bayou Teche , that hope was indeed eternal , and the world was still a grand place in which to live . Photograph // But the wings I had heard earlier were those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a jukebox in a neon-scrolled bar across the Teche . An evil man once told me that hell is a place that has no boundaries , a place that you carry with you wherever you go . A puff of wind blew out the candle burning on Bootsie 's tomb . I could hear the blood roaring in my ears as I walked across the drawbridge toward the town square . The hammering sound in my ears was almost as loud as the music and the shouts of the revelers as I pushed open the door of the bar and went inside .
