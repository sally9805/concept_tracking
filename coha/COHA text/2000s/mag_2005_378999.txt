The Los Angeles Times last week introduced a fiendishly addictive puzzle that in recent months has been stumping players from Taiwan to Tbilisi . Sudoku , which loosely translates to " single number " in Japanese , is a deceptively simple game of logic that consists of a nine-by-nine-square grid , broken into three-by-three-square cells . The object : fill each square with a number from 1 to 9 so that every number appears only once in each row , column and cell . Long popular in Japan , sudoku is based on 18th century mathematician Leonhard Euler 's Latin Square , and first appeared in U.S. puzzle books in the 1970s under the scintillating title Number Puzzle . The Western craze did n't take off until last fall when an enterprising New Zealander used the Japanese name to pitch his puzzle-generating program to the London Times . Sudoku has since been picked up by nearly 60 newspapers , including the New York Post and several others in the U.S. , all willing to inflict sudoku elbow on new generations of fans .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
