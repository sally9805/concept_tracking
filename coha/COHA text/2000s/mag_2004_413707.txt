AN INFUSION OF SWEET , SAVORY APRICOTS CAN ENERGIZE EVEN THE MOST FAMILIAR DISH Photograph // Mention blush-orange , and some people may think of sunsets or tropical cocktails or even rosy complexions . I think of apricots , my first love in the fruit world . Lucky in childhood to spend time on a small California ranch rimmed by dozens of apricot trees , I looked forward to apricot 's season as only a child might do : with greedy anticipation . At that time , I could climb into the trees ' lower branches and pluck off and eat tree-ripened fruit until sated . And this love affair with apricots has never dimmed over the years , though I no longer have trees to climb . Known by the Chinese as " Moons of the Faithful " and meaning " precious " in Latin , apricots , or Prunus armeniaca L , have a faithful following in most countries but especially in Afghanistan , Turkey , Iran , Morocco and Syria-some of the first countries ro welcome apricots as they were carried westward from China centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest apricot grower , though most of its crop is dried and sold in Europe . In the United States , California ranks No. 1 , producing about 77,000 tons of apricots annually , reports the California Fresh Apricot Association , which equals about 95 percent of the country 's annual crop , though states such as Washington , Oregon and Idaho contribute a percentage to the marketplace . When you find fresh apricots in your summer marketplace , take advantage of their relatively short season , and stock your fruit bowl . Select apricots that are yellow-orange and firm , and handle them gently because these fragile fruits bruise easily . Store them at a cool room temperature-you can hasten the ripening of underripe apricots by wrapping them in a paper bag and keeping them at room temperature until ripe . A cousin to the ubiquitous peach , the smooth-skinned and just-sweet apricot is a many-splendored fruit available in many varieties that can embellish both sweet and savory dishes and add a subtle fruitiness when pureed into beverages .
