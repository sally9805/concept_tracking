About half the population of Europe lives along rivers , but suddenly water was the bane of the Continent . Fed by torrential rains , floods from the Black Sea to the Baltic took roughly 100 lives , left thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars ' worth of damage to the farms , cities and hamlets of Central and Eastern Europe . Prague looked like a city under siege . Military rescue vehicles rumbled down the Czech capital 's flooded streets , in which soldiers , firemen and volunteers labored to rescue stranded citizens and keep the Vltava River , which winds through the city , from destroying architectural treasures . They succeeded , but only partly . The barriers they erected saved the famous Old Town , but the river broke through the opposite bank , inundating Mala Strana  --  one of the world 's finest baroque preserves . Water also tore through Cesky Krumlov , leaving a reeking trail of flotsam and sludge in the town 's elegant Renaissance buildings . <P> In Austria the deluge caused an estimated $3 billion in damage , transforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a 20- sq. - mi. lake . Saxony bore the brunt in eastern Germany , where a television station broadcast footage of an elderly woman plunging more than 30 feet into the roiling floodwater when rescuers attempted to airlift her out of danger ; she later died in the hospital . Dozens of patients in Dresden 's hospitals , including a day-old , 1-lb. 8-oz. baby , had to be evacuated by car and helicopter . With the Elbe River rising to its highest level in history , rescuers worked frantically to move thousands of paintings , including Raphael 's Sistine Madonna , from the flooded basement of the baroque Zwinger Palace . <P> Germany 's leaders , who are in the midst of a heated election campaign , were quick to exploit the disaster for political ends . Environment Minister Jurgen Trittin patted himself on the back for a progressive emissions policy while blaming global warming for the wacky weather  --  a connection that is debatable when it comes down to any specific calamity . What experts do agree on is that industrial farming , deforestation and the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , which probably contributed to the severity of the floods . <P> The most lethal of Europe 's recent disasters , however , was unrelated to the storms that so devastated Central Europe . Tourist settlements near the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk were hit Aug. 8 by tornados and flash floods that destroyed 424 houses and killed 59 people . The death toll there is expected to climb as rescuers get to cars washed away by the floods or crushed by falling trees and buildings .  --  Reported by Uwe Gunther , Charles P.
