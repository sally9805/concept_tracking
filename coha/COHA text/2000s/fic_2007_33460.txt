Chapter One Lateness can be a virtue or a sin . Arrive late to a party , for instance , and that 's fashionable . Arrive late for your own funeral and people envy your good fortune . But come late to a possible murder investigation and you have a career problem . But nearly every problem has a solution , and I turned to the attractive lady in the brown and tan suit who was standing beside me and asked , " Come here often ? " " Hey , that 's very funny . " She was not laughing , or even smiling . " It 's my best line . " " Is it ? " " You 'd be surprised how often it works . " " You 're right , " she observed . " I 'd be surprised . " She placed a hand over her mouth and laughed quietly , or maybe yawned . I stuck out my hand and introduced myself . " Sean Drummond , " then added less truthfully , " Special Agent Drummond . FBI . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was trying to ignore me . " Pretty name . " " Is it ? " " I like your outfit . " " I 'm busy . Ca n't you make yourself busy ? " We were off on the wrong foot already . In all fairness , sharing a small space with a lovely lady and a fresh corpse does push charm and wit to a higher level . I directed a finger at the body on the bed . " It 's interesting , do n't you think ? " " I might choose a different adjective . " " Then let 's see if we can agree on nouns-was it suicide or murder ? " Her eyes had been on the corpse since I entered the room , and for the first time she turned and examined me . " What do youthink ? " " It sure looks like suicide . " " Sure does . But was it made to look that way by him ... or somebody else ? " Funny . I thought that 's what I had asked her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , plump forensic examiner was hunched over the body , mining for evidence , and all I could see was the victim 's head and two medium-size feet ; the territory between was largely obscured . But here was what I could observe : The victim was male , late fiftyish , neither ugly nor attractive , tall nor short , skinny nor fat , and so forth . An everyday Joe . A man with bland features and a gray brush cut , physically ordinary and entirely unmemorable . It occurred to me that if you walked past him on the street or sat beside him on the subway , you would look right past or perhaps through him . And there , I thought , was one putative motive for going either postal or suicidal-fatal anonymity . " How long have you been here ? " I asked Ms. Tran . " Thirty minutes , more or less . " She was jotting notes in a small notebook . She shifted her shoulder and-accidentally , I 'm sure-blocked my view of her notebook . She asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a little help getting oriented ? " What I failed to mention was why I was here in the first place , which had something to do with the victim 's phone being tapped by people from the FBI , who were working with people from the CIA , who had overheard a phone call from a distressed lady to the local cops , reporting a corpse . The victim was what is termed in the intelligence business a target of interest ; was being the operative tense . Now he was an object of mystery , and in every mystery there are five basic questions . Who died was obvious , as was where , leaving the three questions I was sent here to figure out-when , how , and with any luck , why . Nobody informed me why and in this business , do n't ask . If you need to know , they 'll tell you . Irritating , certainly , but there are valid and important reasons for this rule . The fate of our nation might depend on it , so you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Anyway , suspicion of espionage-that was my guess . I mean , the FBI and CIA do n't even like or trust each other . They are the Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside , except in cases of espionage , when the crap lands on both their doorsteps . Then you have two prima donnas sharing the same small stage , and we all know what that gets you . Also worth noting , with the country at war-in Afghanistan and Iraq-espionage had become a more noteworthy matter than during the cold war , where spies mostly just gave up other spies , like homicidal incest . By all the spook thrillers and Hollywood flicks you 'd think that was what the whole cold war thing was about . In truth , it was little more than the waterboys at a pro football game snapping towels at each other 's butts . Entertaining , for sure : Ultimately , however , the successes were never as great , and the failures never as dire , as they sounded . The more serious stuff would be handled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genuinely serious issues by a pair of gentlemen with briefcases who could turn out everybody 's lights . Post-9/11 , however , was a new world . Times change-espionage today meant falling towers , crushed nations , and soldiers ' lives . About that latter point , you can bet my interest was more than passing . Which brings us to me-a newly promoted Army lieutenant colonel by rank , attorney by trade , Judge Advocate General Corps by branch , temporarily assigned to the CIA , though neither Ms. Tran nor the local cops were supposed to know any of that . The CIA is really into disguises , covers , and concealment . Inside the United States , usually this means we 're impersonating other federal agencies , and you have to get your act straight . CIA people tend to be intelligent , clever , snide , and arrogant , and you have to suppress that . Feds tend to be intense Goody Two-shoes , wholesome , nosy , pushy , and obnoxious , so I was good to go on three out of five . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Tran had returned to ignoring me , so I asked her , " Are you going to help me out or not ? " " Why should I ? " " I 'll make it worth your while . " " Will you ? How ? " I smiled . " Afterward , you can take me to lunch , dinner , Bermuda , whatever . " She replied , without visible enthusiasm , " Let me think about it . " Apparently she became distracted by something on the other side of the room , and she wandered away . I should also mention that , at the moment , I was assigned to a small and fairly unique cell inside the CIA titled the Office of Special Projects , or OSP . About the only thing special about this cell that I can see is it gets the stuff nobody else wants-this job , for instance . In my view , it should be called the Office Where All the Bad Shit Gets Dumped , but the spooks are really into smoke and mirrors , so nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , this office works directly for the Director of Central Intelligence , which has advantages , because we do n't have a lot of bureaucratic hoops to jump through , and a big disadvantage , since there 's nobody else to pin the screwups on , so it 's a bit of a high-wire act . Also , there are large and significant cultural differences between the clandestine service and the Army , and I was experiencing a few adjustment difficulties . I 've been warned , in fact , that if I remove my shoe and speak into the heel again , I can look forward to a long overseas trip someplace that really sucks . These people need to lighten up . Nor is it unusual for Army officers to be loaned , or , in military parlance , seconded to other government agencies . The idea , as it was explained to me , is we each bring something different to the table-different specialties , different mind-sets , different wardrobes-and the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts . In an organization , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's called multiple personality disorder . I 'm not really sure about the difference , but there it is . But for reasons I have yet to understand , the Agency requested me , and for reasons I fully understood , my former Army boss was happy to shove me out the door , so you might say it seemed to work out for everybody ; except perhaps me . But Phyllis Carney , my boss , likes to say she looks for " misfits , mavericks , and oddballs , " for their " willingness to apply unorthodox solutions to ordinary problems . " It 's an interesting management theory , and I think she 's started looking into a new one since my arrival . Ms. Tran now was poking her head inside the victim 's closet . I approached her from behind and asked , " Anything interesting ? " She turned around and faced me . " There are three cops , a forensics expert , and four detectives here . Why me ? " " Update me , and I 'll get out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what I had to say . " Is this because I 'm an attractive woman ? " " Absolutely not . " Definitely . I said , " You look smart and you take notes . Like the girl I sat beside in second grade . " " When was that ? Last year ? " She smiled at her own joke . Which brings me to the here and now : 10:30 a.m. , Monday , October 25 , Apartment 1209 in a mammoth complex of rental units , mostly cramped efficiencies and one- and two-bedrooms , on South Glebe Road . There was no sign in front of the building that advertised , " Cribs for Swinging Singles , " though I was aware it had that reputation . The apartment was small , essentially one bedroom , an efficiency-style kitchen , closet-size living room , and an adjoining dining room . A Realtor 's brochure would characterize it as cozy and intimate , which is code for cramped and uninhabitable . The furniture was sparse and looked new , and also cheap , the sort of crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount furniture warehouse . I observed few personal , and no permanent touches ; no books , no artwork , few of the usual trinkets or junk people sprinkle around to individualize their living environment . You can usually tell a lot about a person from their home . Especially women who tend to think that how they dress , and how they decorate , are reflections of their inner selves . More often it reveals who they 'd like to be , though that contrast can also be telling . Men are n't that complicated or interesting-they 're usually anal or pigs ; usually shallow pigs . Anyway , I judged the inhabitant here to be fairly neat , not showy , highly organized , and thrifty . Or , alternatively , broke , with the personality and interior complexity of an empty milk carton . I knew the victim 's name was Clifford Daniels , a career civil servant , and I knew that he was assigned to the Pentagon 's Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , or USDP , part of the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a singularly important office in the vast labyrinth of the Pentagon , the equivalent of the military 's own State Department , where strategies for world domination are hatched and war plans are submitted for civilian approval , among other dark and nefarious activities . Also I knew Clifford was a GS-12 , a civilian rank roughly equivalent to an Army colonel , and that he had a Top Secret security clearance . Regarding those facts , I considered it noteworthy that a late-middleaged man in a serious profession such as he , working in a sensitive and prestigious office such as his , would choose to live in a complex nicknamed the " Fuck Palace . " I should mention one interesting personal touch I observed as I passed through his living room : a silver frame inside which was a studio-posed photograph of a mildly attractive , middle-aged lady , a smiling young boy , and a frowning teenage girl . This seemed incongruous with Clifford 's living arrangements , and could suggest that we had just stumbled into his secret nooky nest , or he was divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just inside the border of the county of Arlington , which explained all the Arlington cops , homicide dicks , and forensics people trying to get a fix on this thing . Were this suicide , they were wrapping up and about to knock off for an early lunch . If murder , on the other hand , their day was just starting . As I mentioned , the smell was really rank , and I was the only one without a patch of white neutralizing disinfectant under my nose-or the only one still breathing . At least I looked manly and cool while everybody else looked like character actors in a stunningly pathetic milk commercial . But in my short time with the Agency , I had learned that image is all-important : The image creates the illusion , and the illusion creates the reality . Or maybe it was the other way around . The Agency has a school for this stuff , but I was working on the fly . Anyway , Bian Tran was staring at her watch , and she sort of sighed and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She looked at me and continued , " I spoke with the lead detective when I arrived . It happened last night . Around midnight . " She said , " I think your nose is already telling you that . Am I right ? " After five or six hours at room temperature , a body begins purging gases , and in a small and enclosed space such as this , the effect was worse than the men 's room in a Mexican restaurant . Whatever Cliff had for dinner the night before was revolting . She noted , " Statistically , that 's the witching hour for suicides . Not the exact hour , per se . Just late at night . " " I had no idea . " " About 70 percent of the time . " " Okay . " I was looking at the window . Unfortunately , we were on the twelfth floor of a modern high-rise and the windows were permasealed . I would either have to breathe slower or get her to talk faster . She said , " Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darkness means gloominess , and if the victim lives alone , a mood of depression and isolation sets in . " I must have looked interested in this tutorial because she continued , " Spring . That 's the usual season . Holidays , though , like Christmas , Thanksgiving , and New Year 's are also fatally popular . " " Weird . " " Is n't it ? When normal people 's moods go on the upswing , theirs sink into the danger zone . " " Sounds like you know this stuff . " " I 'm certainly no expert . I 've helped investigate seven or eight suicides . How about you ? " " Strictly homicides . A little mob stuff , a few fatal kidnappings , that kind of thing . " I asked her , " Did you ever investigate a suicide that looked like this ? " " I 've never even heard of one like this . " " Was there a note ? " She shook her head . " But that 's not conclusive . I 've heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even mailed . " She walked over to the dresser and began a visual inspection of the items on top : a comb and brush , small wooden jewelry box , small mirror , a few male trinkets . I followed her and asked , " How was the body discovered ? " " The victim uses ... used a maid service . The maid had a key , at nine she let herself in and walked into this mess . " " Implying the apartment door was locked when she arrived . Right ? " " It has a self-locking mechanism . " She added , " And no ... there are no signs of burglary or break-in . " " The cops already checked for that ? " I knew the same question would later be asked of me , so I asked . " They did . The front door and a glass slider to the outdoor porch are the only entrances . The slider door was also locked , if you 're interested . Anyway , we 're on the twelfth floor . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialed 911 , and they switched her to the police department . " I already knew that , but when you fail to raise the predictable questions , people get suspicious and start asking you questions . My FBI creds looked genuine enough to get me past the crime recorder at the door ; now all I had to do was avoid any serious discussions that would expose what an utter phony I was . I 'm good at that . Checking the next box , I asked , " Where 's the maid ? " " In the kitchen . Name 's Juanita Perez . Young , about twenty . Hispanic , and very Catholic , probably illegal , and at the moment , extremely distraught . " " I 'll bet . " I mean , I arrived at this apartment anticipating a corpse , and yet , between the malignant stench and the sight , I was still appalled . Juanita expected perhaps a messy apartment , but not a dead client , definitely not one in his vulgar condition , and for sure not a green card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom , lured , perhaps , by the odor , lugging her cleaning bucket and possibly a duster or some other tool of her trade . She opened the bedroom door , stepped inside , and bingo-a man , totally naked , lying on his back , utterly exposed with the sheets rumpled around his feet . On the bedside table was a full glass of water , and discarded on the floor by the bed was a pile of unfolded garments : black socks , white boxers , dogeared brown oxfords , a cheap gray two-piece business suit , white polyester shirt , and a really ugly necktie-it had little birds flying on green and brown stripes . His sartorial tastes aside , it looked like the same outfit Cliff wore to the office the day before . For the watchful observer this is a clue of sorts . Also , nearly beneath the bed with only a corner sticking out , was a worn and scuffed tan leather valise , which for reasons I 'll explain later , you can bet I kept a close eye on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed a foot on that valise , and pressed down . The contents felt hard and flat-a thick notebook , or maybe a laptop computer . I then nudged the valise farther under the bed and , to distract Ms. Tran , pointed at the pile of clothes and observed , " He undressed in a hurry . " " Well ... I 'll bet messing up his clothes was the least of his worries . " (
