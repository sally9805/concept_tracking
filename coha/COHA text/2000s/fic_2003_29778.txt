1 I decided to listen to my family and get back out there . " There 's life after divorce , Sarah , " my father proclaimed , not that he 'd ever been divorced . " The longer you wait , the harder it 'll be " was my sister Carol 's little gem , as if she had some way of knowing whether or not that was true . After months of ignoring them , responding to a personal ad in the newspaper seemed the most detached way to give in . I would n't have to sit in a restaurant with a friend of a friend of one of my brothers , probably Michael 's , but maybe Johnny 's or Billy Jr . ' s , pretending to enjoy a meal I was too nervous to taste . I need n't endure even a phone conversation with someone my sister Christine had talked into calling me . My prospect and I would quietly connect on paper or we would n't . HONEST , HOPELESSLY ROMANTIC old-fashioned gentleman seeks lady friend who enjoys elegant dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , n/s , young 50 's , widower , loves dogs , children and long meandering bicycle rides . The ad jumped out at me the first time I looked . There was n't much competition . Rather than risk a geographic jump to one of the Boston newspapers , I 'd decided it was safer and less of an effort to confine my search to the single page of classifieds in the local weekly . Seven towns halfway between Boston and Cape Cod were clumped together in one edition . Four columns of " Women Seeking Men . " A quarter of a column of " Men Seeking Women , " two entries of " Women Seeking Women , " and what was left of that column was " Men Seeking Men . " I certainly had no intention of adding to the disheartening surplus of heterosexual women placing ads , so I turned my attention to the second category . It was comprised of more than its share of control freaks , like this guy-Seeking attractive woman between 5 ' 4 " and 5 ' 6 " , 120-135 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for possible relationship . I could picture this dreamboat making his potential relationships step on the scale and show their bank statements before he penciled them in for a look-see . And then this one . Quaint , charming , almost familiar somehow . When I got to the slow bloom of affection , it just did me in . Made me remember how lonely I was . I circled the ad in red pen , then tore it out of the paper in a jagged rectangle . I carried it over to my computer and typed a response quickly , before I could change my mind : Dear Sir : You sound too good to be true , but perhaps we could have a cup of coffee together anyway-at a public place . I am a WF , divorced , young 40 , who loves dogs and children , but does n't happen to have either . - Cautiously Optimistic I mailed my letter to a Box 308P at the County Connections offices , which would , in turn , forward it . I enclosed a small check to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week later I had my answer : Dear Madam , Might I have the privilege of buying you coffee at Morning Glories in Marshbury at 10 AM this coming Saturday ? I 'll be carrying a single yellow rose . - Awaiting Your Response The invitation was typed on thick ivory paper with an actual typewriter , the letters O and E forming solid dots of black ink , just like the old manual of my childhood . I wrote back simply , Time and place convenient . Looking forward to it . I did n't mention my almost-date to anyone , barely even allowed myself to think about its possibilities . There was simply no sense in getting my hopes up , no need to position myself for a fall . I woke up a few times Friday night , but it was n't too bad . It 's not as if I stayed up all night tossing and turning . And I tried on just a couple of different outfits on Saturday morning , finally settling on a yellow sweater and a long skirt with an old-fashioned floral print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed my teeth a second time before heading out the door . Morning Glories is just short of trendy , a delightfully overgrown hodgepodge of sun-streaked greenery , white lattice and round button tables with mismatched iron chairs . The coffee is strong and the baked goods homemade and delicious . You could sit at a table for hours without getting dirty looks from the people who work there . The long Saturday-morning take-out line backed up to the door , and it took me a minute to maneuver my way over to the tables . I scanned quickly , my senses on overload , trying to pick out the rose draped across the table , to remember the opening line I had rehearsed on the drive over . " Sarah , my darlin ' girl . What a lovely surprise . Come here and give your dear old daddy a hug . " " Dad ? What are you doing here ? " " Well , that 's a fine how-do-you-do . And from one of my very favorite daughters at that . " " Where 'd you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your dear mother 's rose garden . God rest her soul . " " Uh , who 's it for ? " " A lady friend , honey . It 's the natural course of this life that your dad would have lady friends now , Sarry . I feel your sainted mother whispering her approval to me every day . " " So , um , you 're planning to meet this lady friend here , Dad ? " " That I am , God willing . " Somewhere in the dusty corners of my brain , synapses were connecting . " Oh my God . Dad . I 'm your date . I answered your personal ad . I answered my own father 's personal ad . " I mean , of all the personal ads in all the world I had to pick this one ? My father looked at me blankly , then lifted his shaggy white eyebrows in surprise . His eyes moved skyward as he cocked his head to one side . He turned his palms up in resignation . " Well , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's okay , no need to turn white like you 've seen a ghost . Here . This only proves I brought you up to know the diamond from the riffraff . " Faking a quick recovery is a Hurlihy family tradition , so I squelched the image of a single yellow rose in a hand other than my father 's . I took a slow breath , assessing the damage to my heart . " Not only that , Dad , but maybe you and I can do a Jerry Springer show together . How ' bout ' Fathers Who Date Daughters ' ? I mean , this is big , Dad , the Oedipal implications alone- " " Oedipal , smedipal . Do n't be getting all college on me now , Sarry girl . " My father peered out from under his eyebrows . " And lovely as you are , you 're even lovelier when you 're a smidgen less flip . " I swallowed back the tears that seemed to be my only choice besides flip , and sat down in the chair across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to order a coffee . " Wait a minute . You 're not a young fifty , Dad . You 're sixty-six . And when was the last time you rode a bike ? You do n't own a bike . And you hate dogs . " " Honey , do n't be so literal . Think of it as poetry , as who I am in the bottom of my soul . And , Sarah , I 'm glad you 've started dating again . Kevin was not on his best day good enough for you , sweetie . " " I answered my own father 's personal ad . That 's not dating . That 's sick . " My father watched as a pretty waitress leaned across the table next to ours . His eyes stayed on her as he patted my hand and said , " You 'll do better next time , honey . Just keep up the hard work . " I watched as my father raked a clump of thick white hair away from his watery brown eyes . The guy could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . " Oh , Dad , I forgot all about you . You got the wrong date , too . You must be lonely without Mom , huh ? " The waitress stood up , caught my father 's eye and smiled . She walked away , and he turned his gaze back to me . " I think about her every day , all day . And will for the rest of my natural life . But do n't worry about me . I have a four o'clock . " " What do you mean , a four o'clock ? Four o'clock Mass ? " " No , darlin ' . A wee glass of wine at four o'clock with another lovely lady . Who could n't possibly hold a candle to you , my sweet . " I supposed that having a date with a close blood relative was far less traumatic if it was only one of the day 's two dates . I debated whether to file that tidbit away for future reference , or to plunge into deep and immediate denial that the incident had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . My father smiled encouragingly . Perhaps the lack of control was in my wrist . Maybe I merely forgot to swallow . But as my father reached across the table with a pile of paper napkins to mop the burning coffee from my chin , I thought it even more likely that I had simply never learned to be a grown-up .
