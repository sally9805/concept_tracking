Securities-industry regulators charged the brokers Waddell &; Reed last week with improperly switching customers from one variable annuity to another . The firm denies the allegation , but sales of variable annuities  --  mutual funds with insurance contracts  --  have been eyed by regulators for years . One reason : high fees , often north of 2% of assets annually . Before you buy , experts say , you should fund less costly tax-advantaged accounts , such as 401(k)s . Ask about surrender charges , which can run up to 7% for cashing out early . And make sure you need the features you 're paying for .  --  By Barbara Kiviat
