A few seconds into Sex and the City , the HBO sitcom cleaned up so it can be rerun on TBS ( starting this Tuesday ) , you notice something missing . It 's not the sex ; it 's the samba . The opening credits are cut radically , bars of the Latin theme song snipped . What does a risque pay-cable show look like on basic cable ? For one thing , shorter . <P> Sex and the City is not the first HBO show to have its reruns syndicated ; The Larry Sanders Show has run on Bravo . But here the dirty talk and naughty bits are more integral . To phrase it like one of those koans sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) earnestly types into her laptop , Can you have Sex without all the sex ? <P> A look at a few episodes from TBS ( like HBO and TIME , a unit of Time Warner ) shows that you can  --  sort of . The most conspicuous cuts are , surprisingly , not in the nudity  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . When Samantha ( Kim Cattrall ) , the randiest and thus most excised character , trysts with her fireman lover , TBS cuts a scene of them humping against a fire engine . But it 's more jarring when another fire fighter catches her trying on his uniform and yells , " Get the freak out of my freakin ' gear ! There 's a freakin ' fire ! " <P> As a picture of urban reality , that 's pretty freaked up . Yes , profanity can be a crutch for lazy minds . But used by good writers , it helps create character and place . And on Sex , the talk is ultimately more important than the action . In the original version of the episode The Real Me , Margaret Cho , playing a foul-mouthed fashion-show producer , personifies New York City : stressed out , uninhibited and slightly nuts but vital , driven and alive . Divested of her F bombs , her character practically disappears . <P> So does some of Sex 's character , encapsulated in that now condensed credit sequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drenched by a bus that hits a puddle . It 's part fantasy , part dirty reality  --  the chaos of city life , the comic messiness of sex . Even a judiciously censored version will inevitably tilt toward the fantasy . TBS 's Sex is a fine , perceptive comedy ; it 's just not quite the same fine , perceptive comedy . The difference is the difference between making love and a certain gerund I ca n't write here . Both are wonderful things . But we all know they 're not the same . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
