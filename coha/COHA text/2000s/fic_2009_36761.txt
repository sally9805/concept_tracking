After Everything Woke Up <p> <p> Jayjay awoke beside Thuy ; comfortably he molded himself against her . Early sunlight filtered in through the redwoods . The newlyweds were in sleeping bags on the forest floor beneath a tree . They 'd teleported here to install their home . It was the first of May . <p> <p> A big blue Steller 's jay perched on a jiggly thin branch overhead , cocking his head . Jayjay teeped stealthily into the bird 's mind . He savored the gentle jouncing of the branch , the minute adjustments of the jay 's strong claws , the breeze in his comfortable plumage ; he chirped contentedly , Chook-chook-chook-chook , then inhaled through the nostrils of his fine black beak , relishing the smells of fruit and flesh , studying the promising scraps on the ground , assessing the large creatures beside the mound of goods ; but now , Kwaawk kwaawk kwaawk , one of the big animals moved her limbs . The jay released the branch , glided free , and flapped to the next tree . Kwaawk kwaawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's his name . " <p> <p> " All the others have that name , too ? " said Jayjay . <p> <p> " Yeah , but each of them says it differently . " Thuy turned to face Jayjay , giving him a kiss . " I ca n't believe we own this piece of land . What does that even mean ? We handed over our money so that a record somewhere says , ' Property of Jorge Jimenez and Thuy Nguyen . ' But there 's so many plants and animals already living here , and if you count the other silps too  --  it 's an empire . " <p> <p> " I hope they do n't resent us . " <p> <p> " Those nice smooth rocks by the stream like us fine , " said Thuy . " Teep into them . See how eager they are to be in our foundation walls ? They like the idea of being mortared together , and of rising above the ground . Beating gravity is a big deal for a rock ! " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teeping Thuy teeping him teeping her . The first few times that they 'd telepathically mirrored each other , they 'd felt themselves tobogganing toward the point-attractor of a cerebral seizure . Fortunately , you could always shut off your telepathy . With practice , Jayjay and Thuy had learned to skate around the singular zones , enjoying the bright , ragged layers of feedback  --  well , Jayjay enjoyed this more than Thuy . Not too long ago , he 'd been addicted to merging with the planetary mind called the Big Pig . He liked head trips . <p> <p> After a little more mind play , Thuy gently pushed Jayjay away . She was smiling , with her eyebrows optimistically arched . Her longish black hair hung loose , her pink lips were delicately curved . Hanging a few feet above her was a Stank shampoo ad . Thuy and Jayjay made their living as ' round-the-clock members of a reality show called Founders . But they 'd learned to ignore the ad icons and  --  above all  --  the vast worldwide audience . If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your teep . But fewer and fewer things seemed private enough to bother hiding . <p> <p> " You really think we can teleport a whole house this far ? " asked Thuy . <p> <p> " Sure , " said Jayjay . " Working alone , you and I ca n't teek much more than a couple of hundred kilograms at a time . But with a dozen of our friends pitching in , for sure we can move our little house here from San Francisco . We 'll build the foundation today , and this evening  --  alley-oop !  --  we drop our cozy nest into place . Housewarming party ! " <p> <p> They 'd already brought bags of sand and cement for the foundation , also a big flat pan for mixing the mortar , a mortar hoe to mix it with , plus a pair of mortarboards and trowels . Jayjay liked tools , and had managed to borrow these via the human mindweb . The silps in the tools were stoked about the coming job . <p> <p> " It 's gon na be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thuy . " It 's so peaceful here in the woods . I feel like lying around and thinking up a beautiful scene for my new metanovel . Or teeping with animals . Is n't this supposed to be our honeymoon ? " <p> <p> " We can teleport the stones instead of carrying them . Teek ' em . " <p> <p> " That 's work , too . When I reach out and remotely teleport a rock  --  I bet my brain wattage shoots up to a thousand . " <p> <p> " It is n't just your brain that does the teeking , " said Jayjay . " We think with our whole bodies . Consciousness is everywhere . " <p> <p> " Whatever , " said Thuy . " I 'm just not ready to move hundreds of stones . " <p> <p> " Aw , come on , Thuy , " said Jayjay . " When we were in high school , you were always the goody-goody , not me . You 're the ant and I 'm the grasshopper . And the grasshopper 's rarin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put that stale rap away , " said Thuy . " It 's been a long time since I was an ant . I 'm all grown up now . I 'm every bit as wild a kiq as you . " She rolled toward her knapsack and dug out some dried fruit . " It 's too bad the rocks ca n't teleport themselves . Then we could just , like , teep out invitations and they 'd all show up . " <p> <p> " Actually we 're lucky that animals and plants and objects ca n't teleport , " said Jayjay . <p> <p> " I guess so , " said Thuy . " Otherwise Kwaawk the bluejay would be eating these raisins instead of me . And if flames could teleport ? They 'd eat the whole world . I wonder if Gaia is actively preventing the lower orders from teleporting . " <p> <p> " I do n't think it 's Gaia 's doing , " said Jayjay . He 'd been one of the first to figure out teleportation , and he liked to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar to the human mind . Rats and roaches are too carefree to fuzz out and teleport . Over the millennia , we humans have evolved toward thinking ourselves into spots where we 're not . It 's all about remorse , doubt , and fear . As for intelligent objects  --  sure the silps can talk , but they do n't have our rich heritage of hang-ups : our regrets about the past , our unease about the present , our anxiety about the future . Humans are used to spreading themselves across a zillion worlds of downer what-ifs . That 's why we can teleport . " <p> <p> " Depresso mongo , " said Thuy . " Remorse , doubt , and fear ? That 's all you see in your life ? How about gratitude for the things that worked out  --  like , ahem , marrying me ! What about curiosity ? What about hope for a sunny tomorrow ? Happy what-ifs . " <p> <p> " Let 's get back to the rocks , " said Jayjay , in retreat . " Even though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance points . And whether they 're a good match for their neighbors . " <p> <p> " I can just hear them , " said Thuy . " Lay me now , mortarforker ! " She liked speaking extravagantly . It was a way of rebelling against her prim upbringing . " Trowel my crack ! " She got to her feet to rummage deeper in her backpack , then pulled on her striped tights and a long-sleeved yellow T-shirt . <p> <p> A great shaft of sun slanted into their woodsy glen , with gnats and dust motes hovering in the light . A friendly breeze caressed the newlyweds and stirred the needles on the trees . Kwaawk the blue jay squawked . <p> <p> " Everything sees us , " marveled Jayjay , putting on his baggy black pants and his green T-shirt . " Everything is alive . I like seeing inside Kwaawk 's head . I think  --  if I was n't a human  --  maybe I 'd be a blue jay , or , no , I 'd be a crow . They 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a dragon , " said Thuy , filling her mouth full of nuts and chocolate . She continued her rap via teep . " Dragons are one thing my parents talked about that I really loved . The Vietnamese dragons are n't fat fire-breathers , you know . They 're skinny crocodiles with snaky curves and fringed all over . Punk dragons . I 'd be a dragon playing heavy rock and roll . " Thuy paused to swallow her food . " I just noticed that a water spirit here does n't like us . The silp in this stretch of the creek . " <p> <p> The mind within the narrow , burbling stream was what earlier generations would have called a genius loci , or " spirit of place . " Far from being a superstition-spawned fantasy , the silp was quite real . Silps were emergent intelligences based upon chaotic natural computations as enhanced by the ubiquitous memory storage available via the recently unfurled eighth dimension . Silps were everywhere now . <p> <p> Jayjay was n't quite sure how to address the unfriendly spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hi Gloob , " she said , eating another handful of gorp . " What if my husband and I build you a tiny little dam ? You 'll get a nice waterfall at the downstream edge , with some brook trout in the pool . We can bathe there . " <p> <p> " Gloob ? " said Jayjay , smiling at Thuy . " Husband ? You 're like Eve in Eden . Naming the creatures . " <p> <p> " Gloob really is his name , " said Thuy . " You just have to listen . Like this . " She teeped him a mental maneuver she 'd invented for converting a silp 's self-image to an English name . <p> <p> Jayjay listened inwardly to the crabby spirit of the stream , and , yes , Thuy was right , his name was Gloob . Gloob overlaid an image upon his eddies and lines of flow , the visage of a stern old man with trembling cheeks and curly beard . He did n't like the idea of a dam . <p> <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Clack , Bonk , Rollie , and Harvey . And the redwood overhead  --  her name was Grew . Unlike Gloob , Grew was happy to have Jayjay and Thuy as neighbors . Mammals were good for fertilizing her roots . <p> <p> " But do n't burrow ! " cautioned Grew . <p> <p> Intrigued by his newly learned ability to name the silps , Jay-jay teeped into the aethereal chorus of atoms that made up his body . Each of his ten octillion atomic silps had its own distinct timbre . If he 'd had the patience , he could have started converting the timbres into names to be stored in his lazy eight memory . But there were still practical limits to the sizes of mental feats that a person could do . An octillion steps was at the very edge of what you could expect to carry out in your head , even if you were as obsessive as Thuy 's young friend Chu . <p> <p> Teeping a bit higher up the great chain of being , Jayjay perceived the names of his organs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be talking after he died . At least for a while . <p> <p> Gloob 's scowling ropy face kept hovering in his mind 's eye . <p> <p> Jayjay walked over and took a pee near the stream , not right into it , but close enough to show Gloob who was boss . The little crests of the stream 's riffles writhed . On the telepathic plane , Gloob was gibbering in fury . Jayjay pinched shut the channel connecting him to the angry silp . Bye , Gloob . That was one of the things that made lazy eight telepathy bearable . You could firewall things out . <p> <p> " I say we build our foundation right here , " Thuy said , scratching lines in the dirt with a shovel . She was telepathically comparing her marks to the dimensions of the two-room wooden cottage that she and Jayjay had put together in San Francisco . <p> <p> Jayjay picked up a shovel of his own . " Perfect spot , " he told Thuy . " It 's flat , the light 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream . We 'll scrape out little trenches for the cement mudsills . " <p> <p> Teeping into the Gaian overmind , Jayjay and Thuy viewed Earth 's gravitational field as wiggly orange lines growing out of the ground . Helpful Gaia marked off equal elevation points on the lines , making it easy to see when the ditches were level and true . <p> <p> " I 'll mix the mortar ! " said Thuy when the digging was done . " You get the stones . " <p> <p> Jayjay teeped one of stones he 'd noticed before : Harvey . Harvey was the size and shape of a flattened cantaloupe . It would have been easy enough to walk over and pick him up . But Jayjay wanted to show off . <p> <p> Teleportation was a head trick you played on yourself . You perfectly visualized two locations , got mixed up about which was which , then switched to being there instead of here . <p> <p> When Jayjay had first discovered how to teleport  --  about six months ago  --  he 'd quickly learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured out that he could teleport things without having to move himself at all . This was telekinesis , called teek for short . <p> <p> Teeking Harvey was a matter of merging into the rock 's silpmind and coaxing it into a superposed quantum state in which the rock was both beside the stream and resting in the clearing . And then Jayjay asked the rock-mind , " Where are you ? " precipitating a quantum collapse that put Harvey beside the foundation ditches they 'd grubbed out . <p> <p> Sitting in the clearing , staring at the spot where he was bringing the rock , Jayjay first saw a few twinkling dots in the air , then a ghost of the stone , and then the rock itself . <p> <p> " Oho , " said Harvey . His voice in Jayjay 's head was orotund . " Not the kind of thing I 'd do on my own . That fuzzy bit in the middle  --  how did we manage that ? " <p> <p> " You can watch me move your cousins , " said Jayjay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> <p> " Never mind , " said Harvey . " I 'll just sit here . It 's good in the dirt . " No guru could ever be as mellow and nonattached as a stone . <p> <p> Over the next half hour , Jayjay lined up Rollie , Bonk , and Clack next to Harvey , along with another few hundred of their cousins from the edges of the stream . The rapid flipping between pure and superposed quantum states was making him queasy . He took a break , dropping to the ground next to Thuy . <p> <p> Thuy had set up her big mortar pan in middle of where their living room would be . She 'd carried some buckets of water from the creek and was rocking away with her mortar hoe  --  it was like a regular hoe except that it had two holes in the blade , the better to stir the water , sand , and cement . <p> <p> " Remember , this is a special fast-drying waterproof mix , " Thuy warned . " We better start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasshopper . " <p> <p> " I 'm tired of teeking . " <p> <p> " So use your beautiful bod . I 've got a bucket for scooping up mortar . I 'm gon na mix a little more so there 's enough for the whole first course of stones . " <p> <p> Stepping around the waiting stones , Jayjay lugged buckets of mortar by hand , laying down thick gouts of the gray cement . And then he and Thuy got on their knees and began setting the stones , using trowels and carrying little mounds of mortar on the flat square mortarboards . <p> <p> The smooth stones were somewhat disk-shaped . Jayjay and Thuy set them upright on their thin edges , like rows of books . The stones helped out , teeping among themselves to decide who would fit best against whom . Some were smaller than others . Where necessary , Jayjay and Thuy mortared in extra stones to keep the top edge approximately level . All this took longer than expected , and the mortar was nearly dry by the time the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , huh ? " said Thuy . <p> <p> " Yeah , " said Jayjay . " Let 's eat those sandwiches I brought . " <p> <p> " Vibby , " said Thuy . " Sorry I was rushing you with the mortar . " <p> <p> " Well , I 'm the one who made us get up too early . You just wanted to lie in your sleeping bag and write . " Jayjay hugged her . " Let 's start over . " <p> <p> " I 'd like that . " <p> <p> They ate their sandwiches , laid down , and made love . One flesh . Cozy as could be , they fell asleep for an hour . And then Thuy woke up . <p> <p> " All our little friends are waiting for us , " she said , nudging Jayjay . " And I 'm not talking about the Founders audience . " Jayjay lay there , savoring Thuy 's shape and sound and smell . <p> <p> All around them , listening in , were the pullulating silps  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the currents of the air ; in his hair , his muscles , and his molecules  --  silps without and within . <p> <p> " I like having the big Gaia worldsoul , " said Thuy . " But I get tired of all these tiny , pushy , minds . " <p> <p> " It 's all good , " said Jayjay . " Human minds used to be rare fireflies in the dark . But now everything is conscious  --  lit up . It 's like day instead of night . Look over there  --  our foundation wall already has a silp of its own . " <p> <p> The mind in the low wall was something more than the minds of the individual rocks . She was reveling in her rectangularity . She was happy to know she would soon grow a little higher . Might she ask how soon would that be ? <p> <p> " Oh shut up , " Thuy told the wall . <p> <p> Jayjay and Thuy cuddled a bit more , while Thuy thought about her metanovel . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water from the creek . He was still blocking out Gloob 's telepathy vibes , but he could n't help notice that , by taking so many rocks , he 'd made an ugly bare muddy spot . <p> <p> Gloob 's domain only extended about five meters in either direction , but other silps lived upstream and downstream : there was a separate silp for each little pool , cataract and bend . No point alienating these neighbors , too . In order to quickly search farther afield for building materials . Jayjay reached for mental contact with Gaia , the summit of the planet 's hierarchy of minds . <p> <p> He saw an Earth globe with jungle lips , canyon nostrils , ocean eyes , cloudy hair , and  --  floppy pig ears . The new Gaian mind had based her human interface upon the former orphidnet mind that had been called the Big Pig . <p> <p> The round face winked , sneezed , and inhaled , creating a wobbly vortex that drew Jayjay through the vasty caves of her nose holes into the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green tissue . It was like being a gnat inside a pitcher plant . Pale green pistils swung through the information matrix like snakes ; each pistil 's fuzzy triangular top formed a rudimentary face with two eyes and a snout . <p> <p> " Aha , " said a pistil , addressing Jayjay one-on-one . " It 's you again . " <p> <p> As always , plugging into the global mind was getting Jayjay high . Gaia was brimming over with astute perceptions woven into crystalline truths mounded into white-light peaks and philosophical castles . Each time Jayjay came here , it required a distinct effort to stop himself from merging into Gaia for hours at a time . Those addicted to this style of ecstasy were known as pigheads . <p> <p> Thuy hated it when Jayjay went mentally missing  --  last year she 'd dropped him because of that . Nowadays he worked to manage his habit , not only to keep Thuy , but also in reaction to a hideous overdose experience he 'd had three months ago . He 'd merged into the overmind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He was still digging himself out from under the strata of false memories he 'd accumulated during that session . Sometimes he felt like he was eighty years old . <p> <p> Carefully keeping his focus , Jayjay told Gaia he was looking for flat rocks nearby . The triangular face bobbed gently , then spat out a glowing acorn . It was a locative hyperlink to the natural world . <p> <p> Resisting the temptation to stay there enjoying the Gaian buzz , Jayjay dropped down to ordinary consciousness and mentally followed the acorn 's link . He found himself in teep contact with a slate cliff beside a river in the very forest where he was building his home . The cliff 's name was Herga . Thousands of jagged dark gray plates of slate lay at Herga 's base . Not wanting to make another enemy , he asked the cliff if he might take some of her loose stones . <p> <p> " I treasure every one of them , " teeped Herga in a whispery tone . " But it 's okay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the clearing with Thuy , Jayjay teeked one of the cliff 's stones to lie by his feet . It was a rough-hewn little guy called Camber . Camber was proud to announce that he carried six trilobite fossils within himself ; the trilobites piped up to agree . Camber also pointed out that his edges made up a jagged polygon of thirty-seven sides . He was perfectly amenable to being mortared into the foundation 's sill course . <p> <p> " Just so I feel a little breeze , " he rasped . <p> <p> Jayjay set Camber in place . Well and good . <p> <p> And now it was nearly time for the giant blast of telekinesis needed to fetch the rest of the stones . But , wait , Jayjay 's body was talking to him , asking for food . He ate a dark chocolate bar and , for good measure , he chewed up some roasted coffee beans . <p> <p> " Are you bringing more rocks ? " prodded Thuy . <p> <p> Jayjay got to work , teeking a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . Near the end of the teeking frenzy , the ground near the distant cliff starting looking oddly smooth  --  perhaps Jayjay was being too greedy , and the cliff 's silp-mind Herga was teep-shielding her slates from him . Increasingly weary , working around the strange smooth patch for the last few stones , Jayjay momentarily lost track of what he was doing and almost mistook his own head for a rock , very nearly teeking it off his shoulders and across the clearing . Ow . He stopped . Enough rocks . <p> <p> " You 're wonderful ! " exclaimed Thuy , looking at the pile of slate . <p> <p> Although Jayjay felt like curling up in a ball and hugging himself , he squared his shoulders and smiled . He wanted to keep up appearances for his bride . He got busy laying the slates flat atop the base course of creek stones . <p> <p> As before , the mortar was drying a little too fast . Thuy scolded it . The mortar said it would do what it could to slow down its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their innate quantum computations . <p> <p> Jayjay worked the masonry , staying in close telepathic contact with his trowel . As he neared the end of one wall , he noticed a piece of slate that needed to be rotated an inch so that the course would come out even . He stuck his trowel into the crack between the stones , twisting it and pushing on the slate with his hand . The trowel and the slate were giving him good , steady mental feedback . <p> <p> But now all at once everything got confused . The trowel wriggled out of the crack and sprang to one side , stabbing a deep gash into the ball of Jayjay 's thumb . Chanting a solemn dirge , his blood oozed forth , thick and dark . Dropping his stoic facade , Jayjay cried out in fear and pain . <p> <p> " Oh , poor Jayjay ! " exclaimed Thuy . She fetched a clean handkerchief to press against the wound . <p> <p> Meanwhile , the trowel was apologizing to Jayjay . " He pushed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He meddled . " <p> <p> " Who ? " demanded Jayjay . <p> <p> " Gloob . The silp from the stream . " <p> <p> " We 'll worry about Gloob later , " interrupted Thuy . " First let 's teep into your tissues , Jayjay , and I 'll help you heal . " <p> <p> Jayjay delved down into his thumb to see the frantic hugger-mugger of his platelets , phagocytes , and dermal cells  --  with Thuy 's lithe mindweb avatar glowing to one side . <p> <p> " I can play traffic cop , " said Thuy . " Directing your nutrients and white blood cells to your wound . You can get a thousandfold improvement over just letting the cells and molecules bumble along . I learned about the technique because Nektar was helping Chu fix that underdeveloped spot in his brain tissue . You 've noticed how he 's more sociable now , have n't you ? " <p> <p> " I guess , " said Jayjay distractedly . " Do n't go goosing my cells too hard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> <p> " Do n't worry , " said Thuy . " All I 'll be doing is herding them . Leave it to me . " <p> <p> " Fine , " said Jayjay and tuned out , relaxing into the human-scale world . Thuy had one arm around him , and with the other she was pressing the handkerchief against his hand , with her eyes unfocused . He looked around , wanting to distract himself . <p> <p> Their foundation wall was nearly done . The sun was in the west now , slowly turning gold . A good day 's work . A fine first of May . The redwoods swayed and sighed , the creek chuckled . Jayjay was feeling a tingle at the base of his thumb . <p> <p> Jayjay reopened his telepathic contact with the stream silp . They had to talk . Gloob was scowling and tense  --  ready for the worst . Like everyone else , Gloob had lazy eight omnividence , that is , the ability to see everything on Earth . Gloob well knew how nasty humans could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unhappy silp  --  and he decided to end the feud . As a human , it was up to him to exercise the higher emotions . <p> <p> " I 'm sorry I pissed so close to your bank , " he told Gloob . " I 'm sorry I took so many rocks . And Thuy and I do n't really have to make a dam . Let 's be friends . " <p> <p> Gloob gleamed and grew smooth . " Maybe . If you behave . " The silp paused . " About that dam  --  do you really think I 'd get trout ? " He spoke not so much in words as in pictures . <p> <p> " You bet , " said Jayjay , telepathically pointing out some minnows just upstream . <p> <p> " And  --  do you think you could dig a proper latrine ? " added Gloob . " On the uphill side of Grew ? " <p> <p> " Sure " said Jayjay . " And our house will have a nanoseptic system , with nothing but compost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gurgling sound . The war was over . <p> <p> " Behold ! " said Thuy , gently pulling away the handkerchief . Jayjay 's wound was healed , a pink line in his skin . <p> <p> " You 're amazing , Thuy . " <p> <p> " Come on in and splash off ! " called merry Gloob . <p> <p> With light hearts , Thuy and Jayjay romped in the stream for a while . And then it was back to work . <p> <p> It only took another half hour to finish smoothing out the foundation wall . The mortar set up as hard as stone . <p> <p> " Let 's teleport our love nest now ! " exclaimed Thuy . " We 've still got an hour till sunset . " <p> <p> " It 'll definitely take a dozen of us to move so much mass at once , " said Jayjay . " And it 'll work best if we 're all pushing from the same spot . What if we gather in Ond 's driveway , right where we assembled the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Momotaro , Nektar , Kittie , Chu , Darlene , Craigor , and Sonic . You want to help round them up ? " <p> <p> " Yo u round up Sonic , " said Thuy . " He 'll be spaced as usual , you 'll have to go there in person . For the others , it 'll be enough to teep them . Meanwhile , I 'll get my dad . He wants to help  --  even though my mother 's against it . " <p> <p> Thuy 's voice always got tight and high when she talked about her mother . The two of them had never gotten along well , and now that Minh had been crippled by a stroke , things were even worse . <p> <p> " It 's like Mom thinks you 're still the same bad boy you were in high school , " Thuy continued . " I ca n't forgive her for not coming to our little ceremony at city hall . It would have been the one last nice thing we could have done together . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm terrible not to feel sorry for her . " <p> <p> " Do n't beat yourself up , " said Jayjay with a shrug . " My mother showed up at our wedding stoned , cried her head off , and asked for money . Whatever . Life is about moving on . You and me , Thuy , we 're the only family that matters now . " <p> <p> " Daddy will be heartbroken if I leave him out tonight . He gets so sad and lonely staying home nursing Mom all the time . And she 's always such a  --  " <p> <p> " So go get your father already , " interrupted Jayjay . " And , look Thuy , be patient with your mother today . Even if you do n't want to do it for her  --  do it for you . You 'll feel better about yourself . " <p> <p> " You 're nice to give me good advice , " said Thuy , hugging Jayjay 's arm . " I 'm glad to have someone who cares about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have you , " said Jayjay , embracing her . " You make life worth living . " <p> <p> " We 're married , Jayjay , we 're really married . Do you feel old ? " <p> <p> " Ever since my pighead OD , I feel about eighty . " <p> <p> Oh , stop that . I 'm glad you 've stopped tweaking on Gaia all the time . " <p> <p> They kissed and , just for a goof , Thuy teleported to her parents ' house , right in the middle of the kiss . She grew translucent , then spectral , and dissolved in a cloud of twinkling dots . Jayjay ran his fingers through the air . Without his wife 's lively presence , the teeming woods felt empty . <p> <p> Or  --  maybe not . Two odd shapes were bumbling around in the high branches of Grew the redwood . A pair of stray paper kites ? All the way out here ? No , no , these things were moving on their own , undulating through the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with slitty mouths and golden eyes . <p> <p> Oddly , they were impervious to teep . Although Jayjay could see them with his eyes , he could n't probe into them with his mind . <p> <p> He made a series of wild guesses about what the beings were . The simplest hypothesis was that he was so tired from his wall-building that he was seeing things . Or perhaps Gloob the creek silp was putting these images into his mind ? <p> <p> But they really seemed to have some physicality to them . Might the shapes be woodland air current silps , bending the light so as to appear solid ? Maybe the whole grove was conspiring to scare the settlers away ? <p> <p> The shapes were slowly spiraling down from the tree as if homing in on Jayjay , who was very conscious of being the only human within miles of here . As the forms drew closer , Jayjay began to see them as flying stingrays  --  with odd patterns of dots on their skins . Might they be hydrogen-filled sea creatures ? Mutants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to face them alone . With a quick effort of his will , he teleported to San Francisco . <p> <p> Excerpted from Hylozoic by Rudy Rucker .
