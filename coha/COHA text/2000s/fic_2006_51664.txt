THE OLD WOMEN WERE BATHING MIA in the cafeteria sink behind the serving line . When she stood , water lapped at her knees ; and when she squatted it was like the ocean . There was room to paddle . One of the women said , " Stand up , child . We rinse your hair , " while another poured a cascade from one of the cavernous pots . Ma hunched her shoulders against the torrent and bent her knees under the weight . Then they filled the pot again . And poured again , until the sleek black hair became a veil . " Raise the arms , " they said , turning her this way and that until she was shining like porcelain . Perfect , the old women began to think , perfect like the Virgin in the fountain , Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe , in the plaza of San Cristobal , in the town where they were born . <p> Amedeo swept the glass at the far end of the cafeteria , his sleeves rolled up , the veins standing out against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone had thrown a stone during the night , punctuating the long row of windows . He was a cautious man . He went dabbing with his broom , feeling for any last slivers that might find their way to bare feet . There were children , after all . At the same time , Amedeo tried to remember if there might be one last pane of glass in the stock room , his mind going shelf by shelf . Would he need to cut a piece of plywood instead ? He hated to waste either one ; but the first chill of winter already haunted the high valley , and one broken window invited another . Besides , the townspeople , even the few who remained , needed to know that the school contained human beings . With pride . <p> For two years he had kept the cafeteria spotless . And he had restored a few rooms on the first floor , which were for families . Everybody else had to manage alone . The school was not a hotel . There were rules . Amedeo liked to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not magic away your problems . " But everyone knew he brought the electricity back to the central office and all the way to three classrooms on the north hall . Now the people said , " Amedeo , we need heat in this cruel place . " " Amedeo , there 's a strange car in the parking lot . . . tile hanging from the roof ... my child is sick . " Or , " Amedeo : the old drunk , he died in the gymnasium . The policia will come if we leave him on the floor . " <p> The school itself was like a very old man , half combed and barely buttoned . It was flaking bit by bit into the grave . Close to the east wing there was a stairwell that had come undone , collapsing like an accordion and leaving handrails dangling into space . Most of the windowsills on the second floor were hollow crusts . From time to time there came a crash , another vacant eye in the edifice . But , for a while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music after dark , Victor or Quinton playing flamenco on the steps . Someone always running , laughing , playing . Bits of colored chalk still found in certain rooms . And the cannonade of futbol in the yard . <p> In the evenings a breeze took the odor of garbage out of the valley and spread it over the flatlands . A small stream did the same . There had been protests for years , but every morning a truck caravan paid its fees and deposited another layer of refuse . The valley , some said , was filling up with garbage . Even the garbage pickers had moved higher up the mountainside , and the rich people who collected the fees had moved away entirely . A few shanties had already been covered by the creeping tide of waste . And Amedeo planted trees . He raised seedlings . Then every fall he planted several hundred on the slopes and terraces . He set out Japanese maples because he had heard that in their native land they were known as mountain trees , prized for their color and delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man approaching over the footbridge and up the rocky path that they called steps . He wore cowboy boots , jeans , and a corduroy jacket ; and he came picking his way over the unfamiliar route as if he expected the school at any moment to slide past him . He kept looking up at the children and then down at his feet . In one hand he carried a thin briefcase , and on his head he wore a black Stetson hat . When he reached the rock terrace , he spoke to them in heavily accented Spanish . Then the children pointed into the school . <p> " Gra-see-us " he said . Once inside the main hallway , the man drew a notebook from his briefcase and consulted some papers . He felt in need of a map , but the papers only told him that he was looking for a very short , malformed man . As he walked toward the center of the building , his boots echoing ahead of him , he passed vacant rooms and doorless passages . Some of the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others housed stacks of books , rolls of butcher paper , and furniture remnants-a teacher 's desk with no legs , a row of metal stools , a globe without its stand that someone had kicked into a corner . Outside , the man noticed , it had started to rain . <p> He made his way to the intersection of two halls where he surprised an elderly woman in a shawl and tiered skirt . " Bonus dee-us " he said . " Yo booz-ko ... " - he looked at one of his papers- " Amedeo MMHOZ . Esta aqui ? " The woman scurried away , and the man pushed back his hat , then looked at his watch- " shit " - then continued farther into the school , which to him was like walking back in time . He grew increasingly restless and at the next intersection flicked the light switches outside an office door . Nothing happened . Finally he simply called out , " Hola ! Looking for Amedeo Mutoz ! Anybody speak English ? ! " Which is when he found Victor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor keeping one hand on the knife in his pocket , the man referring frequently to a folder of papers . There was something important , he said , that needed to be signed . Legal papers from America . Very important . Was Seor Muoz in the building or somewhere nearby ? Victor nodded and thought about what to do . He looked at the papers but did not see a blank line for signing , which certainly indicated trickery of some sort . Perhaps he should kill the man , and maybe afterward roll the body into some of the old carpeting that Amedeo kept in the stock room . He could be coming to hurt Amedeo or to take one of the children . Victor thought and coughed and rubbed his eyebrows , reflecting on the bundle of sins he would already be carrying into the next world . And then reached a compromise . <p> On the back of one of the sheets , Victor drew directions that would take the man by a circuitous route into the auditorium . They shook hands , and the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compass . Then Victor slipped into one of the vacant classrooms , through an unframed window , and out into the rain . Moments later he found Amedeo in the auditorium working at the base of a wet wall . There was a gringo , Victor said , bringing papers . Maybe forty or fifty papers , with writing on every page . <p> Before they could continue , a shadow stretched into one of the aisles and a voice said , " You know , I guess I could have followed your map . But then I figured , why waste time when you were probably coming straight here yourself . Does that make sense to you ? ' Cause it makes sense to me . And , hell , I 'm working against a deadline here . " <p> No one moved . Victor slipped his hand into the pocket of his jeans and fingered the button on the knife . Then the cowboy stepped fully into the auditorium and made his way toward the two men . " This looks like one of them old-fashioned movie theaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lacquered sleigh . I do n't believe they put that kind of detail into schools anymore . It 's a bygone age . Down here , I mean . " He stopped ten feet from Victor and Amedeo , shifting the briefcase to his left hand . " You know what else I find amazing ? How easy it is to smuggle a handgun into Mexico . I find that amazing . It 's like all the attention is focused in the other direction , you know what I 'm saying ? " <p> Victor withdrew his hand . <p> " Good , " the stranger said . " I was hoping there would n't be no language barrier . Now . Are you Senor Amedeo Muoz-Ortega , and do you speak enough English for me to make you a very rich man ? " <p> " What do you want ? " Amedeo said . <p> " See ? We 're making progress already . Pretty soon we 're going to be best friends . So I reckon I ought to introduce myself . Here 's my ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's license . " And here 's my card , which you might want to keep in case you need my services anytime after today . " The card said , " Gerald Manly , Private Investigations , 204 Parkway , Suite 3-A , San Antonio , Texas 78212-0300 . " The words were printed over the faint outline of a compass rose , and there was much smaller writing in the lower corners . <p> " Senor Manly . . . what do you want ? " <p> " Well , first , are you Amedeo ? " The cowboy leaned against the last seat at the end of a long row . " They told me you were a dwarf or something . And you do n't look like a dwarf to me . " <p> " I was born with some problems . Why ? " <p> Manly handed over some papers from the briefcase . " ' Cause if this is you , ace , you just hit the lottery . " <p> " Lottery ? " <p> " Figuratively speaking . Just listen for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sisters of Mercy , outside of Matalan . Severe birth defects . Made it through high school . Thought about becoming a priest at age eighteen but did n't go all the way . Worked for a while as a craftsman , whatever the hell that means . Dropped out of sight . Ended up here approximately three years ago , where , much to my benefit , you got your name published on the shitlist of some very important people-local padrones who understand you 're opposed to the economic advantages of recycling . Which is how I managed to find you . Right now you 're forty-one years old . And-here 's where it really gets interesting-you have a younger brother , also forty-one years old. - Let me know if any of this sounds familiar . " <p> " I have no brother . " <p> " Well , maybe you do n't . But like I say , there 's this deadline approaching , and the gentleman I work for is most eager to reunite his family . So let 's just pretend that you 're the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his briefcase again and withdrew an envelope . " ' Cause if you are , then my client would be prepared to compensate you for your time and trouble and to discuss some future financial arrangements , which you might find very satisfying . If you will meet with him . At your earliest convenience , of course . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Well , if you 're his twin . . . " <p> " I have no brothers or sisters . " <p> " Twin , Mr. Mufloz : absolute genetically identical twin . Which would be fairly easy to prove , would n't it , with DNA and all that ? " <p> " But why ? And where would I meet this man ? " <p> Manly shook his head in unbelief . He took a moment to study the banks of wooden seats around him , row after row , like a cemetery . The thought made him sad . He listened to the muffled downpour from outside and watched a slow trickle undulating from the dark patch on the wall next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curving baseboard , across a stretch of floor , and into a shallow orchestra pit below the stage . Already it had formed a pool that shimmered in the half-light . He tried to decide if the water came from a broken pipe in the wall or from a crack in the foundation . It was a mystery . Finally he let out a long sigh , unable to distract himself from the ungrateful nature of mankind and the refusal of certain people to accept evidence of God 's grace in their lives . " San Francisco , Mr. Muoz . If you look in that envelope you will find , besides a very large sum of cash , two first-class airline tickets to San Francisco . One for you , one for me . " <p> " You want me to leave my home , go with you to San Francisco , to meet a man who thinks he is my brother ? " <p> " All I can tell you is that , in America , this happens every day , believe me . People track down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And , no offense , Mr. Muoz , but folks who live in trailer parks and abandoned schools might want to cut the rest of us a little slack in the weirdness department . You understand what I 'm saying ? " <p> The other said nothing . <p> " I get half a dozen cases like this every year . Sometimes it 's good news ; sometimes it 's bad . But it takes everybody a little while to adjust . So here 's the deal . If you decide you do n't like San Francisco or the fellow I 'm taking you to meet , then I can have you back here in the brokedown palace within forty-eight hours . And you get to keep the envelope . That sound fair enough ? " <p> " If I say yes ? " <p> " Well , then , there 's just one more tiny little thing . " <p> Ma knew about the ghosts . Some of them lived in boxes close to the landfill . They looked like mounds of clothing and muttered curses when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . You made ofrenda de muertos and honored them with marigolds on the Day of the Dead . And still others , she suspected , crept along the edges of ordinary life . Victor himself knew of one , in Guadalajara , who lived beneath the stairs of a department store , slipping in through ceiling tiles at night and letting out a wail when the watchman came to track him down . There were creaks and groans all through one 's life , Victor said , hauntings no sane person could explain . Still , the idea of another , invisible person just like her father was hard to believe . <p> When Amedeo came to put her to bed , she asked , " Are you going away ? " <p> " For a couple of days . You stay with Abuelita " <p> " Is it like Mam ? " <p> " No , no . Just for a couple of days . Maybe a week . Here . I put something under the blankets for you , a good luck charm , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for safe keeping . OK ? " <p> " Are you going with that man ? " <p> " Do n't be afraid . I think he is not so bad . Like a big dog , he does what his master says . Now climb in and cover up ; it will be cold tonight . I 'll read you a story from your book . " <p> " Why did you change the covers ? " <p> " Why are you so full of questions ? " He combed the hair from her face with his fingers . <p> " Because it 's different , my bed . " <p> " So you noticed my new invention . Which I made just for you . No other child in the world has a bed-book . Maybe you want to remember , for your own children someday . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " A bed-book , of course . It opens like this , see ? You climb in here , chapter one ; you climb in here , chapter two . I added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's silly . " <p> " Still , climb in , you talk so much you 'll become a frozen princess . OK . Feet all the way in ? Pages down over your shoulders ? Good . Now , anytime you get lonely at night , and Abuelita 's eyes get maybe a little sleepy before yours , then what do you do ? You climb into your book , at the proper place of course ; pull the pages down , like this ; and make yourself a part of the story . OK ? " <p> " It 's not really a book , is it ? " <p> " Ask me after I get back , after you have dreamed sweet dreams . Now-I open your little book-like this-and what do I see ? A faraway place and a woman named Shahrazad . " <p> " Was she a princess ? " <p> " Shh . We 'll see what happens . Close your eyes and listen . Once there was a sultan named Shahryar , who ordered his wazir to bring forth each evening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ' " <p> Ma edged closer to her father 's head as he sat reading . He leaned against the bedframe and put one shoulder into the light while holding the book very close to his face . With his good hand he turned the pages , and with the other he held the book against his knees . From where she lay he looked like a very large child in pain . His voice , though , was soft and low , like singing . She listened for a while , peeping over his shoulder at the pictures and puzzling over the mysterious names . <p> " ' . . . when the wazir heard these words from his daughter , he told her , from first to last , all that had happened between him and the sultan . Whereupon Shahrazad said , " By Allah , this must not continue ; send me to ransom the daughters of Moslems and to deliver them from . . . " ' " <p> The first picture was a sultan in a red turban with his chin in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of his throne . The second one showed Shahrazad standing among the treasures . The colors of her robes and the layers of light in the throne room were as deep and rhythmic as her father 's voice . Every time Amedeo turned a page , he turned a thin coverlet over her bed . It was silly . But there were no heavy quilts , and soon she felt warm and safe . After a while there was only his voice and the pictures in her head . A woman with a veil across her face , rings upon her fingers , and jewels within her hair . Hair as soft and dark as the night . <p> On the plane Amedeo said , " If what you say is true , then what is my real name ? " <p> Gerald Manly opened a folder on his tray and turned the pages so that Amedeo could see from the next seat . " Your real name is Muftoz , although your mama 's name was n't Ortega . It was Kingsley . " He let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , in those days , the sisters wanted to protect . . . something or other . " <p> One of the pages appeared to be an official form , and paper-clipped to it were two photocopied prints of a man and a woman . The man had a broad and smiling mouth under a thick moustache . He wore an open-collared shirt and looked directly into the camera with inquisitive eyes . The woman , on the other hand , had been photographed from twenty or thirty feet . She was more of a girl than a woman and stood under a palm tree holding a sunhat while gazing out at the ocean . Thin , tall , and intense , she had the look of both privilege and vulnerability . <p> " What did the nuns tell you ? " Manly said . <p> " I was what used to be called a monstrous birth . I do n't know what they call it now , but then it was a child so malformed it endangers the mother , and will likely die even if born alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do an abortion . Someone , I suppose , persuaded her otherwise . " <p> " Maybe she did n't take any persuading . " <p> " What did they tell you ? " <p> " The sisters ? Not a whole hell of a lot . " Manly turned to a page from a legal pad with a date at the top and jotted notes . " Except I did pick up the one minor detail that set this whole thing in motion , that you 're exactly two minutes and eight seconds older than your twin . It appears the doctors were trying to save not just your mothers life but also your brother 's . She must have been a stubborn gal . " <p> " She died ? " <p> " Thirteen months after you were born . Car accident . You were too . . . sick to be taken in by an elderly couple . Not really expected to live . So I guess the Kingsleys decided to leave you where you were. - Sorry . " <p> " No one 's fault . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ever decide you want to hear the story of your father , I expect you 'll have the resources to find out . Did n't seem to interest your brother all that much . " <p> " If he is my brother . " <p> " Yeah . If he is . But , you know what , my guess is that he had a whole bunch of people checking all angles before he sent me to do the pickup . He seems like that kind of guy to me , a businessman . " <p> " You never told me his name . " <p> " Armando . Armando Kingsley . " <p> " Who now needs my kidney . " <p> " Way I understand it , an ordinary transplant wo n't work . There 's something messed up about his insides , too , and they need an exact match or something pretty close to an exact match . " <p> " I see . " <p> " It only takes one kidney to stay alive . " <p> " Lucky for me . " Amedeo turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenery . He was surprised at how ordinary the trip seemed , how like a visit with friends in a nearby village . <p> Armando Kingsley lay in a bed capable of changing its shape . Sometimes nurses raised his feet higher than his head , and sometimes doctors bent him into an obscene W. Often it was no more than an orderly who would enter the dark room , adjust the controls , and turn away before hidden motors had ceased their straining . Once , when he had first arrived at the surgical unit , Armando watched such a bed fold itself into a perfect cube before a janitor rolled it away . It left him wondering if they had simply left the patient inside and bypassed the morgue . But there were , of course , other telltale machines in the room , their monitors offering a blue green zodiac of shapes during his sleepless nights . <p> Therapists had placed pillows beneath his ankles and legs , and then more pillows beneath his shoulders and arms . He felt at times like a potentate , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than a whisper . At other times he felt like a prehistoric monster sinking into the muck that would become his grave . None of the medical staff understood the effort required for simple communication . Every sip of water had to be paid for in pain . His own people , on the other hand , had been exquisitely trained . They came at the touch of the second call button , the one pinned to his sleeve ; and they anticipated his needs . The investigator Manly had proved to be especially effective . <p> Well within the deadline set by the surgeons , Manly had returned with the brother . Then he left almost immediately on a second errand that Armando had proposed . <p> After the initial screening of the brother , there had been a battery of tests , and it was during a routine scan that the doctors made their discovery . For an ordinary man it would have been too much to bear ; but Armando thought first of his businesses and of the empire he had built over twenty years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and analysts who predicted catastrophe , and yet in every crisis he had survived . It was his dominant trait . So when the news reached him , he invited the brother to his room more out of curiosity than despair . They examined each other in silence . <p> Finally the low voice said , " I was expecting something more dramatic . A hideous little man . And I suppose you were , too . What did Manly tell you about me ? " <p> Amedeo tried to think of what he should feel at such a moment . He stepped closer to the bed and examined the body and its wrappings . The man was much taller than Amedeo and at one time had been much larger in girth . Now he looked like a broken marionette , and the voice sounded like that of a ghost . " He told me that you were in pain . And in need . " <p> " Come closer . I want to see what I could have been . And maybe you do , too . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I suppose you are . I could have made you rich for the rest of your life. - You do n't walk very well do you ? Something about the spine , they said . " <p> " I would n't have done it for the money . " <p> " Ah , easy enough for you to say now . " <p> " I 'm not that kind of man . " <p> " Perhaps . But with only one functioning kidney , what you really are is a sort of joke . On both of us . " <p> " I am sorry for your condition . " <p> " Do you know what I find particularly revolting about poor people ? " The voice took on a new animation , and the arms worked to move the head higher in the bed . " It 's not their fawning submission or their injured innocence or their pitiful lack of initiative . It 's their pride . They are the most arrogant people on the planet-did you know that ? - and the most self-centered . I find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply unendurable . They can not sell what they do not have , and so they moralize about it . Endlessly . " <p> " Still , I am the only family you have . And I am truly sorry that I can not help . " <p> Something like a smile began to spread itself across the face . " Well , now . What you just said . That 's not entirely true , is it ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> Armando Kingsley let the question hang for a moment . Then he said , " How much do you want for the girl ? " <p> Amedeo turned . " I have to go . " <p> " Pride , do you see ? You 're so offended by my language , you do n't consider the good you could do for your child and yourself . And for the godforsaken heap that you call a village . " <p> The retreating figure became a shadow and then a vague outline against the door . <p> " I am told . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told there 's a very good chance that she would be a sufficient match . And I am telling you that for the temporary use of something that she does n't really need-a momentary discomfort really-she could advance herself beyond what her father and her quaint little friends are capable of imagining . If that 's of any interest to you . " <p> " I have to go . I think it is your disease that is talking now . " <p> Manly drove for an hour after picking up the rental car . This time the rolling countryside seemed to grow less familiar as he neared the mountains , almost as if he 'd never made the trip before . It was a puzzling sensation . Several times he checked his map , just to be sure . Finally he decided that it was the creepers and vines growing right to the edge of the road that made him uneasy . Something about the relentless and varying shades of green felt prehistoric to him . Tendrils kept reaching over the edge of the road and into the tire tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic ever stopped , Manly thought , they would reclaim their space in a week . <p> As the route grew steeper and the switchbacks more frequent , the detective rehearsed his speeches . He liked to have three or four scenarios in his head because you could never tell . Sometimes you had to improvise ; sometimes you had to stick with the script . But the right combination of words , the right phrase at the right moment , could work wonders . Get you out of a tight spot , or keep you from stepping into one in the first place . It just needed to sound natural . That was the main thing . Keep it conversational . He turned off the radio and talked to himself until he finally reached the caf where he had parked the first time . There he paid the man five dollars to watch his car and began the long climb up to the school . <p> He did n't need to study the photograph of the girl . He had a mind for certain kinds of details , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was the one who had not pointed into the school . <p> After crossing the footbridge and climbing the steepest part of the steps , he stopped to catch his breath and to wipe the inside of his hat with a handkerchief . He admired the stream beside the path and the way roots of certain trees held the stones in place . And that first blush of color in their leaves . The school from this perspective looked like one of those Tibetan palaces , some place you 'd want to visit by photograph but not by foot . After another few minutes of climbing , he heard music and followed the notes to a lone figure seated on concrete steps . <p> It was his friend Victor . <p> Gerald Manly put on a sad and serious face . Then waited until the music reached the end of a measure and the guitar player looked up . Victor laid the flat of his hand over the strings , studying the figure who had just emerged from the gathering dusk . <p> " Where Amedeo ? " Victor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out to shake hands and then sat on the wall next to the steps . " There 's been a complication , though . The procedure did n't go as smoothly as we 'd hoped . " <p> " Procedure ? " <p> " Yeah , a complicacin . He wants to see his daughter . Su hija . He wants me to bring her north . So he can see her . You understand what I 'm saying ? " <p> " Ma ? " <p> " That 's right . Ma . Is she here ? " <p> Victor said nothing . He wiped at his face with one hand and then laid the guitar into its worn case , closing the lid with slow care and flicking the latches with his thumbs . The complication seemed to weigh on him heavily , and he leaned forward with elbows on knees , thinking . When the cowboy asked again if Ma was nearby , he said absently , " Si . En cafetera . " <p> Manly stood up . " Well , see , the thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this , but I 'm afraid it 's fairly serious . I think he 'd like to see her tonight if that 's possible . " <p> " You take her ? " <p> " Well , yeah , if you think it 's all right . Here 's the paper . " He handed over several sheets that had been stamped and signed . Manly pointed to Amedeo 's signature at the bottom of the first page . " It 's called a guardian ad ! item , purely for visa purposes . But you do n't have to worry about sending her off with no stranger . We can bring anybody else that you 'd like to send with her . I 've got all the paperwork ready . ' Cause we want to do what 's right here . For Amedeo . " <p> Victor studied the papers . <p> " So . I guess we better get going . " <p> Vctor did not look up . <p> " Did you say she was inside here ? In the cafeteria maybe ? " <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway and then waited at the intersection for Victor to catch up and point the way . They passed the auditorium where he had first found Amedeo and turned toward a collapsed stairway that blocked the far hall like a rockslide . At still another cross hall they turned left . <p> " All of the very much paper , " Victor said . <p> The detective tried to reassemble these words into some kind of sense and then decided it was n't possible . " I know just what you 're talking about . But let me tell you something . It 's a new world , my friend . A whole new world . Every damn thing in it is paper , and I mean everything . That 's the God 's honest truth . One way or another . " <p> " It does not seem right . " <p> " Let me tell you something else , ace . Do n't ever underestimate the power of paper . I know a man . . . I know a man who built an empire on nothing but . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the topic . He considered the many ways in which the world was made of paper , and the thought seemed to please him more than most thoughts . It was something difficult to explain to a simple mind . He imagined the far reaches of the man 's empire and the doors that could be opened with paper keys . He did not hear the click of the knife . Rather , he felt Victor step into place beside him , lay the sharp tip of the blade between two ribs , and push . <p> Author Affiliation
