<p> COGNAC , France  --  In the region that gives its name to the creme de la creme of brandies , one might expect that purity prevails . The locals , thus , would sniff at all those Cognac-infused mixed drinks concocted at trendy bars in the USA and insist , instead , that an amber-colored liquid that goes down so smoothly should be served neat . <p> One might expect . But one would be wrong . <p> Look no further than Chateau de Bagnolet , Hennessy 's VIP guest house on a sprawling estate in this charming , picturesque town of 20,000 in southwest France , where bartenders eagerly serve Hennessy Shanghais , cocktails mixed with ginger ale , dashes of Angostura bitters and a twist of orange peel . Nearby , at the Courvoisier and Martell chateaus , visitors sip Cognac cosmopolitans ( Cognac , cranberry juice , lime juice and triple sec ) . <p> Surprising for France , perhaps . But for Americans , cocktails such as these have helped propel Cognac 's popularity to new heights . Last year , 52.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest ever . And sales by volume are up nearly 23% since 2002 , according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States . <p> Top-selling Hennessy pushes mixed drinks at its Hennessy Artistry Concert Tour , an invitation-only concert series in seven American cities from April to October . Four specialty cocktails ( Hennessy New York , Hennessy Shanghai , Hennessy Paris and Hennessy Miami ) are served to about 400 taste masters in each locale to show how Cognac can be used instead of vodka and gin . <p> Because Cognac is made with grapes , a Cognac cocktail goes more naturally with a lunch or dinner that also might include a glass of white or red wine , says Cyrille Gautier-Auriol , Hennessy 's international training and promotion manager . " You do n't have mixing with more industrial products like vodka or gin . That 's also why Cognac is more and more appreciated . " <p> To be sure , brandy cocktails , though again in vogue , are not new to the USA . The traditional Sidecar ( Cognac can be used instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been around since World War I. Going even further back , Philadelphia 's City Tavern , around since 1773 , still serves cocktails that have their roots in the era of Jefferson , Adams and Franklin : the Raspberry Shrub ( mashed , vinegarized and sweetened raspberries with Cognac and soda ) and the City Tavern Cooler ( apple cider , Cognac and rum with a splash of whiskey ) . <p> The stakes today , however , have been raised as more mixologists nationwide use their creative juices to come up with new concoctions . <p> Master mixologist Brian Van Flandern , for example , was recently hired to spiff up the cocktail menu at the famed Bemelmans Bar at the swank Carlyle , a Rosewood Hotel , on New York 's Upper East Side . Among his additions : Viva la Cognac ( Cognac , dry Palo Cortado sherry , lemon juice , Junipero gin and simple syrup ) . <p> At Tsuki , a Japanese restaurant and lounge in Chicago , a popular choice from the bar is the Rising Sun ( Hennessy Cognac , amaretto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maui , there 's a macadamia-nut brulee ( Baileys , Navan vanilla Cognac , Hennessy VS Cognac , light cream , simple syrup and crushed macadamia nuts ) . <p> " The primary reason why Cognac is coming back into vogue is because the mixologists of the world are seeking out the freshest and the highest-quality ingredients , " Van Flandern says . <p> Helping to ensure quality are the stringent laws regarding Cognac , from mandatory double distillation in copper stills and aging in French oak barrels to the kind of grapes that can be used and from where , as well as the date by which Cognac must be distilled  --  one day late and it 's everyday brandy . <p> " Because it ( Cognac ) is made from grapes , it pairs so well with juices , " Van Flandern says . " It is the most logical way to make a really great cocktail . " <p> Logical , maybe . But not always affordable . <p> Try to explain , for example , paying $550 for the Le Reve des Anges ( Hennessy Timeless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleurs du Roi ( Remy Martin Louis XIII , Perrier Jouet La Belle Epoque Fleur de Champagne , brown sugar syrup and Angostura bitters ) at the XO Bar of the InterContinental Hotel in Atlanta . For $225 , enjoy the 13th Stallion ( Veuve Clicquot Champagne , Remy Martin Louis XIII , fresh lemon juice and simple syrup ) at the Thoroughbred Club in the Charleston Place Hotel in Charleston , S.C . <p> If that all sounds like a bit much , consider mixing your own with an increasingly wide selection of Cognacs new or arriving soon to the U.S. market . <p> In September , Courvoisier introduces Exclusif , a more well-aged VSOP of blended Cognac ranging from five to 12 years and sweeter than regular VSOP , thus enhancing its potential for mixes . <p> Another option : Meukow , a small , family-owned label that has been around since 1862 , recently created Meukow Cognac 90 , a 90-proof , less-aged VS Cognac that features more aroma and alcohol than its regular VS and comes in a sexy black-and-silver bottle with the panther logo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more seductive with our sexy packaging , " says Damien Bertrand , an area manager for Meukow 's North America and Europe markets and duty-free manager . " But we do n't want to just play marketing . We want to play a real added value . With the 90-proof , you have the unique opportunity to create cocktails in which you will feel more of the Cognac . " <p> Parlez-vous Cognac ? <p> As with most distilled spirits , age matters with Cognac , and older is usually considered better ( and more expensive ) . The following designations guarantee by law the age of the youngest eau-de-vie <p> ( the spirit used in Cognac ) , although a small amount of very old eau-de-vie commonly is used even in the youngest Cognacs . <p> *VS ( Very Special ) . Aged at least two years . <p> *VSOP ( Very Special Old Pale ) . At least four years . <p> *Napoleon , XO ( Extra Old ) or Hors d'age . At least six years , but prime Cognacs may have aged for dozens of years @ @ @ @
