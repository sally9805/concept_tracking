In a new memoir , Sela Ward tells how her southern roots eased a great loss Photograph " This draw back to home was so intense for me , " says Ward ( in her Beverly Hills house ) . I ca n't be the only one who feels this way . " // She has faced the scrutiny of modeling agents , casting directors and TV critics , but actress Sela Ward insists , - It 's the most intimidating thing in the world to write a book . " Especially one as personal as her new memoir Homesick , which recounts her journey from small-town southern belle to big-time Hollywood star and her need , despite fame , to reconnect with her roots . The book was a labor of love : Originally asked to write about ageism , the 46-year-old Ward declined , but she could n't resist an offer to talk about her upbringing . " The South is so woven into my being , my fiber , " she says . She spent a year on the project , combining her own reflections with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer on the set of Once and Again and during four visits to Meridian , Miss. , where she owns a farm five miles from the house where she grew up .

" The oldest of four children of engineer Cranberry Holland Ward , now 78 , and his homemaker wife , Annie Kate , Ward attended college at the University of Alabama . After graduating in 1977 , her dreams of an acting career led her to New York City , where she supported herself by modeling , and then to Hollywood , where she quickly landed roles in movies ( Blake Edwards 's The Man Who Loved Women ) and TV ( prime-time soap Emerald Point , N.A.S. ) .

" And that 's what happened for me , in a big way . " In the following excerpt , Ward , who is in negotiations for a feature-film role but does n't plan to do another TV series while her children are still young , recalls a time earlier this year marked by loss-the end of Once and Again and the death of her mother at age 76-and the comfort she drew from the caring and community of her hometown . " It is an attempt to share my journey with people who have a yearning for home , to give them hope that it is always still there , " she says , patting her heart , " in here .

" // " Sela , I do n't know how to tell you this , " he said , " but the director told me , What I really want is Sela Ward 10 years ago . ' ' " I was 39 . I 'd never felt more sexy and more confident as a woman , and more ready as an actress . Yet as I quickly discovered , if you were over 35 , you were n't any of those things as far as Hollywood is concerned . Crushed , I went on retreat to nurse my wounded ego . As I sat soaking in a bathtub , reading an article on why women lie about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postmenopausal woman in the Midwest who still kept tampons in her desk so people would think she was younger . It was an awful story , but I thought : Thank God-I 'm not the only one worrying about my age . Then , in 1999 , Ward won the plum role of Lily Sammler in Once and Again ; it earned her an Emmy in 2000 . Though critically acclaimed , the show floundered in the ratings and by early 2002 was in danger of being canceled . Truth to tell , I had mixed feelings about the show coming to an end . I loved Lily more than any other character I 'd played . But the ongoing concern about ratings was draining : Here I was , doing the best acting of my career , and all the while I knew I was about to lose this intelligently written and deeply felt character because not enough people were tuning in . At the same time I knew , every early morning when I left for work and every late night I came home , that all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to my own . I worried about that . And in my heart I wanted it to be over . In January Ward 's sister Jenna called with bad news . " Sela , Mama 's really sick , " she said . " She 's in the hospital and she did n't feel like talking on the phone . You know how she always wants to talk . Daddy told me , jenna , she 's fighting hard , but this is too much . I do n't think she 's going to make it . ' Sela , he started crying . " Our daddy does n't cry . We 'd been through this before . Mama had cheated death more times than I care to recall . But no matter how sick Mama had been in the past , Daddy always insisted she was going to pull through . This time was different . Once and Again 's producers chartered a jet to take Ward to Meridian that night . When we reached Mama 's bedside , it was obvious that she was in a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was close to her and told them that this was it , they needed to come say goodbye . After four days Ward had to return to work . Leaving my mother was one of the most painful things I 've ever had to do . I took her face in my hands , savored her sweet smell and told her , " I 'll be back , Mama . I promise . " " I know you will , " she whispered . " I know you will . " That made one of us . It was the worst week of my life . There I was , stuck in L.A. , agonizing over my mother 's failing health , waiting for my show to die , working 18-hour days , never seeing my children , who had to face the fact that their grandmother was about to die , and their mom was n't there to help them through it . I white-knuckled it through that week , waiting for a phone call that mercifully never came .

We had spent the last nine years trying to keep Mama alive , through cancer , emphysema and other illnesses . Once , when she was in the hospital for an aortic-aneurysm in operation , she stayed 45 days , and we were right there with her ; after she pulled through , surprising even the doctors , we Ward siblings were left with an illusion of omnipotence , a feeling that we had the power to keep her alive , if only we could be with her and love her hard enough . In the end the most loving thing we could do was to let her go . We cradled her and caressed her and told her again and again that it was all right to let go . There was , in those long moments , a wonderful warmth in the air , the kind of easy feeling Mama always created around her . We would take turns sharing memories from our lives with Mama . " We love you , Mama , we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And then she took her final breath with those exhausted lungs , and she died . A tear dropped down her cheek . Mama , unsentimental to the last , was finally able to cry . After the funeral Ward went back to L.A. to finish shooting Once and Again ( which was officially canceled in March ) and come to terms with her mother 's death . For a moment the world she left behind felt impossible to sustain . My creative outlet was gone . My daddy was on his own . And I had lost my rock of comfort and support . Only then did it come into focus , just what a deep and complex legacy Mama had left for me . . Everything I feel about the South contains echoes of the way I feel about my family : love , pride , protectiveness , that instinct to share and preserve and defend . I want my children to know what their own mama 's world was like when she was their age , in every way-from its physical contours and pace of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of the older generation . Thirty years ago I moved away from Meridian because things I needed to make me happy could n't be found there . Now I come back because so many of the things I need to make me happy ca n't be found anywhere else .
