chapter one The School of Colour and LighT STudies The academic , in his grubby , paint-spattered robes of faded ' viaduct ' blue , turned the crank lever with his free hand . The cog wheels in the rotating tower high above him chattered and squealed like angry ratbirds , and a shaft of light cut through the dusty air . The academic levelled the brush in his other hand and tilted his head to one side , his pale yellow eyes fixed on the youth before him . ' A little more to the left now , I think , Master Quint , ' he said , his voice soft but insinuating . ' So the light catches you . Just so . . . ' Quint did as he was told . The early morning light streaming in from the high tower window fell across his face , glinting on his cheekbones , the tips of his ears and nose and , with its rusting pipes and gauges , the battered armour he wore . ' Excellent , my young squire , ' the academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush into the white paint on his palette and dabbed lightly at the tiny painting on the easel before him . ' Now we must let the light work its magic , ' he murmured . The dabbing continued . ' The highlights complete the picture , Master Quint . But I must insist that you hold still . ' Quint tried to maintain the pose - but it was n't easy . The tower was small and airless , and the heady odours from thepigments , the pinewood oils and the thinning varnishes were combining to make his eyes water and his head ache . The rusty , ill-fitting armour chafed his neck , and his left leg had gone quite numb . Besides , he was dying to see the finished portrait . It was all he could do not to turn right round and inspect it for himself . ' The dawn light , ' clucked the academic . ' There 's nothing like it for illuminating the subject . . . ' His pale yellow eyes darted back and forth over Quint 's features . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He chuckled , and Quint tried not to blush . ' The protg of none other than the Most High Academe of Sanctaphrax . . . ' He turned away and began stabbing at the palette like a woodthrush after a spanglebug . ' How lucky you are , Master Quint , not to have to scrabble about with the rest of us in the minor schools , but to be given a place at the most prestigious academy of them all . I wonder . . . ' The academic 's voice was laden with sudden spite . ' I wonder what you actually did to deserve it ? ' The academic 's eyes were fixed on Quint 's face once more . They were so pale that there was almost no difference between the irises and the yellowish white that surrounded them . It was a mark of his trade , Quint told himself , trying not to shudder . Just as years of working as an Undertown rope-turner resulted in spatula-shaped fingers , and just as a slaughterer tanner from the Deepwoods ended up with skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , the eyes of Sanctaphrax portraitists were gradually bleached by the vapours of the thinning varnishes they used - and Ferule Gleet had been a portraitist for many , many years . ' I was the Most High Academe 's apprentice . . . ' Quint looked down , his cheeks blazing as he remembered the monstrous gloamglozer and the night of the terrible fire . ' Keep still ! ' rasped Gleet , irritatedly dabbing at the portrait . ' Ah , yes , ' he smiled thinly . ' There was that fire at the Palace of Shadows , was n't there ? Strange and dreadful business . . . How is the Most High Academe ? Recovering well , I hope . ' The pale yellow eyes bored into Quint 's once more . ' As well as can be expected , ' the youth replied , but the words rang hollow in his ears as he thought of his mentor lying in the gloomy bedchamber at the School of Mist . Linius Pallitax had suffered grievously at the hands of the terrible gloamglozer . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had , for now he never left his bed , and his haunted eyes stared into the distance , seeing neither his faithful servant , Tweezel , nor Quint , his apprentice - nor even his own daughter , Maris , who sat beside him for so many hours , praying for him to recover . Ferule Gleet daubed at the tiny painting in silence for a moment . ' As well as can be expected , eh ? ' he mused at last . ' Does n't sound too good . You would n't want anything to happen to him , my fine young squire . Not in your position . ' ' My position ? ' said Quint , trying not to move . ' You 're the High Academe 's protg , are n't you ? Without him , you do n't expect that the Knights Academy would accept you into its hallowed halls , do you ? Of course not ! ' Ferule shook his head . ' Sanctaphrax born and bred , that 's always been the rule . The rest of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . ' He wiped his brush on a piece of rag , and turned the easel round . ' There , ' he announced . Quint found himself staring at the miniature painting of a young knight academic in gleaming armour , with deep indigo eyes and a smile on his face . Ferule Gleet of the School of Colour and Light Studies had done a fine job all right . Quint shivered . ' Is anything wrong ? ' Ferule asked . ' It 's nothing , ' Quint said quietly . He had no intention of telling the pale-eyed academic about the memories the miniature painting had stirred - memories of the first time he 'd had his portrait done . How young he 'd been then . Four , maybe five years old ; the youngest of six brothers . His father , Wind Jackal , had commissioned the mural of the whole family for the grand hall of their palace in the Western Quays . What happy days they 'd been . But they had n't lasted , he thought bitterly . Within a year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treacherous quartermaster - had torched his master 's house . Quint 's mother and brothers had perished in the blaze , and with them , the painting itself had been destroyed . From the Hardcover edition .
