Rhianna Campbell slowed the rental car as she entered the town limits for Shepherd , New York , population 642 . A smile , the first one in hours , curved the corners of her mouth . Shepherd was undergoing a population boom . When she 'd moved away ten years before , the official census was 598 . The tiny hamlet nestled in the picturesque Hudson Valley was frozen in time . There were no malls or multiplex movie theaters . How , she mused , was a town able to survive without at least one Wal-Mart or fast-food restaurant ? During one of their biannual reunions , her parents told her that a fast-food chain executive had tried to bribe several town officials to get their approval to erect a fast-food burger outlet in Shepherd , but the lifelong residents went to the county 's district attorney with the scheme . The general consensus was that as long as Campy 's remained open for business , another eating establishment had as much chance of opening in Shepherd as a snowball in hell . Grief had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency had brought her back . Turning off the county road , she continued along an unlit winding stretch of roadway until the two-story brick building that housed the HudsonValley Communities Hospital came into view . She maneuvered into a space in the visitors lot and shifted into park . It took a full minute before she was able to shut off the engine and get out of the car . Vivid memories of speeding to the hospital after receiving a call at her parents ' restaurant that Errol Sutherland and his parents had been transported to the hospital after their car skidded off an icy road , crashing into a tree and exploding on impact , came flooding back . Rhianna knew the moment she walked into the hospital and met Emery Sutherland 's pain-filled gaze that he 'd lost his parents and identical twin brother . She had lost her high school sweetheart , fianc , and a part of herself on that cold and snowy Christmas Eve . Turning up the collar of her lightweight jacket , Rhianna quickened her pace as she walked toward the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California had thinned her blood . Bright lights , antiseptic smells , and the soft squishing sound of rubber soles on highly polished tiles greeted her as she made her way to the information desk . A clerk gave her a pass , her father 's room number , and a stern warning that visiting hours would end in fifteen minutes . Rhianna stepped into an elevator and took it to the second floor . Less than a minute later she walked into her father 's room . Anna Campbell rose from a chair beside her husband 's bed . " You came . " Rhianna nodded as she closed the distance between her and her mother . Wrapping her arms around the older woman 's waist , she kissed her cheek . " Mom , you know I had to come . " Anna eased back , smiling up at her only child . She and Reid reunited with their daughter twice a year , but each time she saw Rhianna , she had changed . Now she 'd cut her shoulder-length curly hair into a pixie style that flattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than thirty-three . Her daughter 's looks were striking : tall , slender , high cheekbones , slightly slanting dark brown eyes , short buttonlike nose , and a lush mouth that made most people men in particulargive her a second look . The California sun had darkened her taupe-brown skin . Rhianna glanced over at Reid Campbell , his chest rising and falling in a slow , measured rhythm . The beeping sounds from the machines monitoring his vitals and his ragged breathing through the tube in his mouth reverberated throughout the small private room . She released Anna and walked over to the bed . Abrasions on his forehead , his right cheek , and chin marred his handsome face , while his right arm was immobilized over his chest by a sling . " Daddy , what did you do to yourself ? " she whispered , as she leaned down and kissed his thinning gray hair . " He ca n't hear you . He 's in a drug-induced coma . " Rhianna knees weakened . " Coma ? " " He hit his head when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His doctor wants him sedated until it goes down . " " But you told me he hurt his arm . You said nothing about a head injury . " Anna ignored her daughter 's strident tone . " If I 'd told you the seriousness of your father 's injuries you 'd have been a basket case before your jet landed . " Running a hand over her short hair , Rhianna nodded . " You 're probably right . " " I know I 'm right . " Anna 's voice was soft , conciliatory . " He 's going to make it , sweetheart . " Turning away from the figure in the hospital bed , she blinked back tears . " How long is he going to be like this ... hooked up to these tubes and machines ? " Exhaling a long breath , Anna shook her head . " I do n't know . " Anna had called Rhianna at her Los Angles home , leaving a message on her voice mail that her father had fallen and was admitted to the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message , called her boss to tell him that she had a family emergency , then went into superwoman mode . An hour after listening to her mother 's voice , she found herself in a taxi en route to LAX . She used the time to call her boss back to inform him that she was taking an extended family leave . She managed to get a stand-by reservation , and then spent the next four hours in the airport before she boarded a nonstop Los Angeles-New York connection . " Your father forgets that he 's a cook whenever he tries to play Mr. Fix-It-Yourself , " Anna continued with a frown . Rhianna stared at her mother . Petite , silver-haired , fifty-eight-year-old Anna had given up a career as a kindergarten teacher to marry Reid and help him run Campy 's . " What was he doing this time ? " The dimples in Anna 's cheeks deepened as she compressed her lips . " He fell off a ladder . " " What was he doing ... " The announcement that visiting hours had ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way out . " Rhianna held Anna 's hand as they walked from Campy 's parking lot to the restaurant 's rear entrance . The original clapboard siding she remembered had been replaced with white vinyl siding and the windows in the three-story farmhouse with a wraparound porch now sported dark red shutters . The restaurant took up the first floor ; her family occupied the second and third . Soft golden light filtered through the curtains in the bedrooms on the second floor . She was still reeling from the disclosure that Reid had attempted to single-handedly renovate the restaurant to include a party room where Shepherd 's retirees could gather for their breakfast specials , card games , and club meetings . Her father had always liked tinkering around the house and the restaurant , hammering or tightening a screw here and there . But he 'd never attempted to build anything . The year he 'd put together a dollhouse for her eighth birthday was the exception . Anna unlocked the door , pushed a button on a wall panel , and light illuminated the storeroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by the familiar structure that had been home for two thirds of her life . The distinctive aroma of apple pie lingered in the air . Anna was renowned for baking the best apple pie in the Hudson Valley . She walked into the dining room and stopped . Nothing had changed . Campy 's was reminiscent of a 1950s soda shop with a counter and stools , bright red leather booths and a large colorful jukebox with compact discs instead of vinyl 45s , which were popular when her parents were teenagers . A slight frown appeared between her eyes . It was the first week in December , yet nothing in the restaurant hinted at the holiday season . " Where are the decorations ? " Anna removed her red knit cap and fluffed up her silver curls . " We stopped putting them up years ago . " " How long ago ? " Anna stared at the black and white tiled floor . " Once you left Shepherd , Christmas never felt the same for me and your father . " Rhianna closed her eyes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . " " I understood why you wanted to go away for a while , but I did n't think you 'd never come back . " She did not want to argue with her mother , they 'd done enough of that before she moved to the West Coast . " I 'm back now , Mom . " " For how long , Rhianna ? " She heard the pain in Anna 's voice and recognized the pain in her eyes . " For as long as it will take for Daddy to fully recover . " She hugged her mother . " Why do n't you go upstairs and try to get some sleep . " " What are you going to do ? " She stared at the colorful clock over the jukebox . " I 'm going to hang out here until I 'm ready for bed . My circa-dian rhythm is out of whack because of the three-hour time difference . " Anna 's gaze met and fused with Rhianna 's . " I 've missed you so much , " she said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please go to bed , Mom , before you have me bawling my eyes out . " Anna nodded . " I 'm going , but I want you to consider one thing . " " What 's that , Mom ? " " Emery Sutherland returned to Shepherd to bury his parents and brother and he stayed . " " He stayed to raise his brothers and sisters . " " True . But he sacrificed what could 've become a rewarding career as a vet to take over his father 's business . " Rhianna felt as if her composure was under attack . Her mother was at it again . No one could lay a guilt trip on better than Anna McCray-Campbell . She called her parents every Sunday night , and at least once a month Anna hinted that she wanted her to move back to Shepherd . Her response was always the same : I like California and my job as a hotel banquet manager . " Good night , Mother . " Anna turned her head rather than let Rhianna see her expression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Mother she knew she had shaken her resolve . " Good night , baby girl . " Rhianna sat in her favorite booth , staring into nothingness . It was where she 'd sat with Errol Sutherland planning their wedding and a future that promised forevera future that ended in a ball of fire . Hours later her lids grew heavy and fatigue swept over her like a heavy blanket . She got up , walked out of the dining room , opened a door , then climbed the staircase that led to her bedroom . Her eyes were drooping as she showered , pulled a flannel nightgown over her head , and slipped under several handmade quilts . She fell into a deep , dreamless sleep within minutes of her head touching the pillow . Rhianna woke up feeling disoriented Friday morning , her body still on Pacific Time . She lay , staring up at the ceiling until she realized she was in her old bedroom . Everything that had happened over the past twenty-four hours , coupled with the image of her motionless father in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her and the tears fell , streaking her face , streaming into her hair and soaking the pillow . She cried until spent , then left her bed and walked on trembling legs to the adjoining bathroom to complete her morning routine . Continues ...
