<p> Safety and speed are the yin and yang of drug regulation . Patients want immediate access to breakthrough medicines but also want to believe the drugs are safe . <p> These goals can be incompatible . Race a drug to market and much is likely to remain unknown when patients take it . Test a drug thoroughly to assess all possible risks and its release may be delayed by years . <p> A series of drug-safety scandals has led many on Capitol Hill to question whether the Food and Drug Administration has failed to strike the right balance between speed and safety . A clear sign of this imbalance , these critics say , is the increasing number of F.D.A. drug-safety officers who say they have been punished or ignored after uncovering dangers of popular medicines . <p> The latest to suffer this fate is Dr. Rosemary Johann-Liang , 42 , who recommended more than a year ago that the diabetes drug Avandia carry the agency 's strongest possible safety warning for its effects on the heart . <p> Dr. Johann-Liang spent Friday sadly winding down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BlackBerry , laptop and office key , and she went to the agency library to make sure she had no overdue books . She wished her colleagues well . <p> A pediatrician and expert in infectious diseases , Dr. Johann-Liang joined the agency in December 2000 and rose through the ranks . For four years , she reviewed drug applications as a medical officer and then team leader . <p> Two years ago she became a deputy division director in the agency 's office of surveillance and epidemiology , the group that examines the safety of already-marketed drugs . <p> In February 2006 , one of her safety reviewers , Lanh Green , went to her with a problem . The agency 's Office of New Drugs had asked Ms. Green to determine whether eye problems that sometimes resulted from taking Avandia and a similar drug , Actos , were a serious issue . But Ms. Green noted that visual deficits were just one part of a drug-induced swelling problem that could lead to weight gain , ankle swelling and , if left untreated , heart failure . <p> Alerts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' labels . Ms. Green suggested consolidating them and highlighting the heart risks with a boxed warning , the agency 's most severe . After a weeklong review , Dr. Johann-Liang agreed . <p> " There 's no doubt these problems are caused by these drugs , and there 's no doubt that patients are continuing to suffer bad outcomes , " Dr. Johann-Liang said . <p> A week later , top officials from the new drug office walked by Dr. Johann-Liang 's office and into the office of her boss , Dr. Mark Avigan , she said . Nearly an hour later , she said , the door opened , the officials left and Dr. Avigan called her in . <p> " Mark told me that they were upset with our recommendation , " Dr. Johann-Liang recalled . " They decided to act like the review never happened . " <p> Dr. Avigan took over the supervision of the safety review of Avandia and Actos and told Dr. Johann-Liang that she could no longer approve strong safety recommendations without his say-so , she said . Over the next year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which contributed to her decision to leave the agency on Friday , she said . <p> In an interview , Dr. Avigan said that he did not intend to punish Dr. Johann-Liang . <p> " My view was simply that when there were conversations going on about important safety issues that were likely to garner a lot of attention , that I needed to be in the loop , " he said . <p> On Wednesday , the F.D.A. commissioner , Andrew C. von Eschenbach , announced that the agency had asked for boxed warnings on Avandia and Actos , more than a year after Dr. Johann-Liang 's recommendation . <p> At least four other F.D.A. safety reviewers in recent years have been punished or discouraged after uncovering similar drug dangers , according to Congressional investigations . Among them : <p> In 2003 , Dr. Andrew Mosholder discovered that antidepressants led some children to become suicidal . When his findings were leaked to a reporter , the agency began a criminal investigation . Dr. Mosholder was prevented from speaking to an advisory committee about his analysis , and the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded a year later that Dr. Mosholder had been right . <p> In 2006 , Dr. David Ross became increasingly concerned about reports of serious illness and death from patients taking the antibiotic Ketek . Dr. Ross met with top agency officials and pleaded with them to take action . Nothing happened , he said . A month later , Dr. Ross complained privately to Congressional investigators . After articles about Ketek 's safety problems appeared in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times , the agency and Ketek 's maker , Sanofi-Aventis , agreed to take actions . <p> After the articles were published , Dr. von Eschenbach held a meeting with Dr. Ross , Dr. Johann-Liang and other safety officials in which he urged them to keep their disagreements " inside the locker room , " Drs . Ross and Johann-Liang said . Those who discussed issues with outsiders would be " traded from the team , " Dr. Eschenbach said , according to Drs . Ross and Johann-Liang . <p> Dr. Ross left the agency in November for the Department of Veterans Affairs . Dr. von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his remarks to Dr. Ross and others to encourage scientific debate . <p> Senator Charles E. Grassley , Republican of Iowa , said Drs . Johann-Liang , Mosholder and Ross were part of a pattern demonstrating the need for reforms at the F.D.A. <p> Heidi Rebello , an F.D.A. spokeswoman , said that the " F.D.A. is not aware of any kind of retaliation , " and that staff members " are committed to respecting all legal rights and protections of our employees . " <p> In interviews , safety reviewers said problems at the agency could be traced back to a deal struck in 1992 . <p> In the 1980s , the F.D.A. took nearly three years to approve most drugs . The AIDS crisis demonstrated that such long delays could condemn to death patients who might have been helped by recent scientific breakthroughs . F.D.A. managers said they did not have enough people to assess reviews more quickly . <p> So in 1992 , Congress helped the F.D.A. and the drug industry reach a deal . Companies agreed to pay millions of dollars in fees , and the F.D.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as little as six months for a life-saving medicine . <p> At the time , it seemed a good solution . But the deal 's fine print soon came to haunt the agency . Drug makers refused to let their money pay for the routine monitoring of drugs ' safety once they were on the market . As the agency began to depend more and more on industry fees , those parts of the agency slowly withered . <p> Perhaps even more important , the culture at the F.D.A. shifted toward valuing speed over safety . The 1992 deal required annual reports to Congress listing review times , but no such reports were demanded of the agency 's assessments of the safety of drugs already on the market . <p> Managers are now largely judged on how quickly their employees make a decision on new drug applications , safety officials say . Questions about the safety of already-marketed drugs are increasingly seen as sand in the gears , they say . <p> Drs . Johann-Liang , Ross and two other safety officials said Congress should require the F.D.A. to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on reports of drug problems within a month or two , and require regular reports on the agency 's adherence to these goals . Such requirements would lead to the promotion of safety-conscious managers , not just speed-conscious ones , they said . <p> The Senate last month passed a bill to overhaul the F.D.A. that includes more money for drug-safety assessments and requires an advisory committee to meet twice yearly to consider safety issues . The House will hold hearings on the legislation this week . <p> The safety officials say the bill does not go far enough , because it does not require clear timelines for a response to safety issues . It also does not require regular public disclosure of F.D.A. safety reviews . <p> " If managers were held accountable on safety issues , they 'd pay more attention to them , " said Dr. Victoria Hampshire , who was disciplined and investigated criminally in part because of her work to uncover the dangers of a heartworm medicine that killed at least 500 dogs . <p> Dr. Hampshire , who still works at the F.D.A. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very demoralized . " <p> " There 's a feeling of fear , " she said. ##
