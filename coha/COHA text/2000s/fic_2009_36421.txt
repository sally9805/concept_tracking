Warlock <p> The demon howled its outrage . <p> Amirantha , Warlock of the Satumbria , reeled back from the explosion of mystic energies unexpectedly hurled at him . Had his protective wards not been firmly established , he would have instantly died ; the demon was powerful enough to send sufficient force through the barrier to slam the magic-user hard against the cave wall behind him . The blow he took on the back of the head was going to raise a nasty bump in quick order . <p> Demons always brought with them a large amount of mystic energies , enough to destroy any unprepared mortal standing nearby as they entered this plane of reality . It was one of the reasons for erecting wards , beyond merely confining the demon to a specific location . This one had arrived with a much more impressive explosion than the Warlock anticipated , and that surprised him . <p> Amirantha incanted a single word , a collection of otherwise meaningless syllables that together formed a key , a word of power that activated a much more complicated enchantment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which often had been the difference between effective control of a summoned demon or dismemberment at his hands . This word strengthened the ward spell that confined the creature . <p> Amirantha regained his feet as the demon continued to howl at discovering himself summoned to this realm and confined . Experience had taught the Warlock that demons rarely objected to being summoned , as they found this world easily plundered . They just hated being confined and controlled . It was the one thing that made Amirantha 's chosen area of study problematic : that which he studied kept trying to kill him . <p> Amirantha took a deep breath to calm himself and studied the enraged conjuration . The demon was not one he recognized ; this was obviously a battle demon of some sort . Amirantha knew more , perhaps , than any man living on Midkemia about demons and their nature , but he knew only a tenth of what he wished to know . This particular one was new to him-though he conceded he hardly had an exhaustive knowledge of every demon in the Fifth Circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roughly human in build , with a bull 's head , or at least something that resembled a bovine . Long horns arched down and forward , giving weight to the Minotaurlike appearance . Absently , while beginning to conjure a spell designed to immobilize the demon , Amirantha wondered if such a monster had been the basis for the ancient myth of the Minotaur . <p> The legs were , if anything , goatlike , and there anything remotely familiar about the creature ended . The eyes burned like hot coals , and the body was covered in something like black fur up to the waist , though it was not wool , hair , or fur as Amirantha recognized such . The upper body was black leather , but slicker , shinier , as if leather had been tanned , dyed , and polished , and his horns were blood-red . Amirantha also observed from the howls shaking the cave that the demon 's disposition was getting nastier by the second . <p> More to the point , the demon looked on the verge of rending his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to ever place too much stock in the word " should " when a demon was involved . <p> He finished strengthening his spell of confinement and saw the demon step back a moment , shudder , then return to his attempt to rend the wards , accompanying his effort with an even louder bellow . <p> Amirantha 's eyes widened slightly , his only outward concession to surprise . The demon just shrugged off a spell designed to immobilize any conjured entity . Or at least Amirantha 's idea of " any " until this very moment . <p> Looking at the railing demon , Amirantha , Warlock of the Satumbria , stroked his chin whiskers as he considered what he observed . A vain man by any measure , he affected purple robes with silver needlework at the collar and sleeves and had his servant trim his beard and hair weekly , knowing exactly how it should look each time . His receding hairline had caused him to let his dark hair fall to his shoulders , and his dark brows and pointed chin beard gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demons . Or at least look the part to those who were willing to pay gold for the summoning or banishment of demons . <p> He muttered a very reliable invocation and watched . The demon should have instantly knelt before his master in abject obedience , but he could sense the summoned creature 's rage growing at the command . Amirantha sighed in a mixture of frustration and confusion , and wondered what he had conjured this time . <p> Ignoring the ringing in his ears , the Warlock reached into a large belt pouch . He had personally sewn this pouch years ago , patiently weaving magic into the threads as he labored under the supervision of a master artificer named Leychona , in the great City of the Serpent River , his one and only attempt at fabricating magic cloth . He had been pleased with the results , this confining bag that let him gather together many stones of power without disastrous consequences . He was especially proud of the needlework , but found the entire process so tedious and exasperating he now paid artificers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own skills or his gold . <p> His finger rubbed lightly against a series of embroidered knots inside , which indicated each pocket he had fashioned . He found the one he sought in less time than it took to think on it and withdrew a stone prepared against a time such as this . Holding it aloft , he incanted a spell that drew power stored in the stone and he directed it to the hastily reinforced barrier . He felt , almost physically , the shock reverberating through the ward as the demon hurled himself against the mystic defense . <p> Then the creature paused , looking at the space in the air where the barrier stood , as if he could see it , and pulled back his massive right fist . He unleashed a blow that might shatter a bull-hide shield , and Amirantha could swear he felt the shock from it travel through the air to strike him . At least that 's what he told himself when he flinched . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
