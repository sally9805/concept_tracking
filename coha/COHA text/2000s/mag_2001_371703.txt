The most tension-packed moment of Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff 's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week came , not surprisingly , when he was forced to defend the Bush Administration 's embrace of military tribunals . How could the U.S. hold trials in which the judges are military officers , just a two-thirds vote is sufficient to convict , and there is no need for proof beyond a reasonable doubt ? How could the Administration support legal proceedings that are held in secret  --  meaning a defendant can go from being charged to being put to death without the public ever finding out ? " Whether you have a civilian tribunal or a military tribunal , it 's possible to have a fair one and it 's possible to have an unfair one , " said Chertoff with steely determination . " It 's how you implement it . " <P> The Bush Administration has been just as resolute in defending other hard-nosed legal strategies it has rolled out since Sept. 11  --  a broad array of tactics that supporters are calling necessary tools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpest curtailment of civil liberties in decades . Among the flash points : a new measure that allows the government to listen in on conversations between some suspects and their attorneys , the detaining of more than 500 people nationwide without publicly revealing their identities or the charges against most of them , and the ongoing interrogation of 5,000 people within the Arab-American or Muslim communities . <P> It 's been true throughout American history that when the bullets fly , civil liberties are among the first casualties . During the Civil War , Abraham Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus , the constitutionally enshrined procedure by which a defendant can challenge a wrongful conviction . In World War II , Franklin Roosevelt interned 120,000 Japanese Americans and tried accused German saboteurs in military courts . The Bush Administration is leaning on these historical precedents in saying the traditional balance between security and freedom needs to shift , at least in the short term . " We 're an open society , " President Bush declared last week , " but we 're at war . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polls show strong support for everything from increased government power to detain legal immigrants  --  82% are in favor , according to a Gallup survey  --  to military tribunals . Most seem to agree with the blunt logic of Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch . " Yes , the Administration has been aggressive in using all of the constitutional powers at its disposal , " he argues , but it 's justified because terrorists " are trying to kill Americans  --  as many as they possibly can .
