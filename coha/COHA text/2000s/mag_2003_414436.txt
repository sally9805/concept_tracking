Credit the new BetaPuls platform ( titanium arms fore and aft of the binding plate ) for that stability . With only 70 mm underfoot , you wo n't get the same float as , say , the Rossi B2 , so plan on muscling boot-deep broken crust . GRIPES : Devoted off-pisters will want more width for flotation . PROPS : On groomers and in small chop , this tenacious carver will match your strength turn for turn . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It turns all angles on any pitch , with power , grip , and energy . "  --  Chris Anthony Test Lengths ( cm ) : 170 , 180 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 107/70/98 , 108/70/99 2 DYNASTAR INTUITIV 71 $700 Light and snappy and stable and centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision instrument . The narrow waist and vertical sidewalls underfoot give this ski a strong front-side orientation . Translation : It excels on firm snow . Although it wo n't float as well as the wider Intuitiv 74 , it 's versatile enough to handle the occasional foray into powder . GRIPES : With only 71 mm under the boot , it 's not what you carry to the heli . PROPS : Capable of a variety of turn shapes , it 's an Eastern tree skier 's dream . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The 71 has the nicest blend of power and finesse of any ski in this category . "  --  Mike Britt Test Lengths ( cm ) : 175 , 182 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 109/71/100 3 DYNASTAR INTUITIV 74 $700 The 74 's long forebody cap constructed section ( there are vertical sidewalls underfoot and throughout tail ) make for a smooth-flexing and predictable ride . It flexes and steers into turns so easily that its agile feel on groomed belies the 74-mm waist . Do n't hesitate to take this Intuitiv off-piste into trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet quiet in crud . GRIPES : On icy patches , the forgiving flex does n't deliver enough grip . PROPS : With its broad performance window , it will accept rider error and still deliver elegant turns . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It handled everything with almost no effort . "  --  Hilary Webb Test Lengths ( cm ) : 175 , 182 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 113/74/99 4 ELAN MANTIS 662 $700 The 662 has a wood-and-metal laminate core that gives it an unflappable feel . It also benefits from race room-style vertical sidewalls , which make for an even more solid feel underfoot . While some testers thought the 662 was a little burly in the shovel , requiring a big push to initiate turns , bigger skiers found it to be a surprisingly user-friendly platform . GRIPES : The 662 can be hard to manage on rough terrain at high speed . PROPS : The even , almost elegant flex makes the ski ideal for smooth cruising or carving . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It loves medium-radius carves. "  --  Eric Archer Test Lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : 116/76/102 5 K2 AXIS XP $795 With its big footprint ( 78-mm waist ) and a metal-laminate construction that mimics the dominant race-stock structure , the XP can handle steep powder skiing and unforgiving hardpack . A deep ( 18 m ) turn radius digs trenches in the groomed . With its size and construction , it prefers medium to long arcs . Do n't expect to excel in short-swing turns on groomers : They require major muscle . GRIPES : If you need quick moves , be ready for some aggro tip loading to bring the ski around . PROPS : This ski does n't mind going fast . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It 's the Hermann Maier of ATE skis  --  not some carver wannabe. "  --  Matt Ross Test Lengths ( cm ) : 174 , 181 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 115/78/105 6 K2 AXIS XT $750 The 68 mm-waisted XT is ideal for cranking short turns , but thanks to a metal laminate and K2 's Monic vibration damping module , you can lay down big arcs with confidence , too . Testers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well suited it was for fast front side groomers . Off piste-worthy ? Depends , but there 's enough meat for flyweights to rise above boot-deep snow . GRIPES : The narrow waist gives those north of 170 pounds that sinking feeling in the deep stuff . PROPS : An energetic carver that maintains its punch at higher speeds . TESTER 'S TAKE : " You 'll need Red Bull and No Doz to keep up . "  --  Mike Britt Test Lengths ( cm ) : 174 , 181 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 109/68/99 7 NORDICA BEAST 10 $1,000 ( INCLUDES SYNERGY TRACK N 0312 TI BINDING ) The Beast 10 impressed the likes of rock-solid Gordy Peifer for its stability , and everyone was immediately comfortable on the familiar 74-mm waist . Equally at home on hardpack or powder , the Beast 10 's feel is reminiscent of great race skis : consistent and solid . GRIPES : The tip deflects at high speed in chop ; stay centered or the game 's over . PROPS : The mounting point yields a forward-of-center feel that , combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow powder . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It 's DSL quick , with a powerful , aggressive nature that feeds off what you give it . "  --  Aleisha Cline Test Lengths ( cm ) : 173 , 183 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 110/74/102 8 ROSSIGNOL BANDIT B1 $760 Despite being the skinniest of Rossi 's B group ( 70 mm at the waist ) , the B1 has the same silky feel as its portly brethren . It 's also a far better short-swing turner , letting you attack tight chutes and snap slalom turns on hardpack . Although its damp character is more than adequate for moderate chop , do n't expect it to consume sun-crusted crud . GRIPES : Does n't float like a butterfly . PROPS : Stings like a bee : The B1 lets you slice and dice groomers , bumps , and tracked snow . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It will drop into any turn shape easily . "  --  Chris Anthony Test Lengths ( cm ) : 176 , 182 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 109/70/99 9 ROSSIGNOL BANDIT B2 $800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the B2 sound more like a croissant than a ski . Regardless , the B2 delivers a plush ride more commonly found on broader platforms . Its 76-mm waist means it 's no slalom ski , but you 'll still find relatively quick turn initiation  --  a trait more common to narrower skis . GRIPES : The hard-snow crowd will want more grip . PROPS : Predictable , laid-back , and very easygoing , but with enough energy that it 's always ready to charge the fall line . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The B2 delivers a great carving sensation and quick edge-to-edge response . "  --  Chris Davenport Test Lengths ( cm ) : 176 , 182 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 113/76/103 10 SALOMON SCREAM 8 PILOT $945 ( INCLUDES SALOMON S810TI BINDING ) Our lighter-weight testers favored the 8 for its quickness in short- to medium-radius turns and its predictable behavior in the soft stuff ( thanks in part to a 75-mm waist ) . Some heavyweights , however , thought the 8 Pilot was a bit soft . GRIPES : Muscle skiers will want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROPS : Predictable float in fluff and Jedi-quick moves on groomed make it a great match for the featherweights . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It wo n't kick you for being in the backseat. "  --  Gordy Peifer Test Lengths ( cm ) : 165 , 175 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 110/75/100 11 SALOMON SCREAM 10 HOT PILOT $1,095 ( INCLUDES SALOMON S912TI OR S914 BINDING ) Salomon has banished the hinged feeling from its Pilot system : Now , when you dive into fast turns or rough snow , the ski powers through instead of feeling floppy at the toepiece . Also , the 10 Hot has moved material into key areas of the core . That , in conjunction with a strong tail and a tight , 19-meter radius , means the ski generates plenty of carving pull . GRIPES : For a ski that flexes so easily , it 's surprisingly sluggish in slow , short turns . PROPS : A versatile go-anywhere performer that dares you to ski faster . TESTER 'S TAKE : " It 's a real charger that steamrolls obstacles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 185 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 110/75/100 12 STCKLI STORMRIDER AT $790 With its ample metal layers laminated to a thin-profile hybrid foam core , the AT has a damp , glassy feel that expert skiers weaned on race boards will love . It 's an impressively stable ride : Even the 174-cm test length seemed to prefer long arcs . ( So , unless you 've got thighs like Bode , size this down five centimeters . ) Keep the AT powered up and on edge and then hang in there as it blasts through soupy snow . GRIPES : A little too narrow , a touch too firm . PROPS : A strong expert ski that demands the same attributes in its pilot . TESTER 'S TAKE : " So much power ! This baby lets you haul ass with no speed limit . "  --  Scottie Ewing Test Length ( cm ) : 174 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 109/73/99 13 STCKLI STORMRIDER XL OFFROAD $800 The Offroad XL 's stability comes as no surprise  --  it has almost as much metal as an SUV . Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine that will smooth the nastiest chopped-up bowls or the firmest pitches . The test team loved taking the XL up to speed and laying it over on hard corduroy . GRIPES : There 's not a playful molecule in this ski . Slower , short-radius turns do n't come easily . PROPS : As the strongest , most powerful ski of the All-Terrain Expert field , its qualities border on Big Mountain Expert . TESTER 'S TAKE : " Motors like a bad-ass ' ' 65 Lincoln Continental . "  --  Scottie Ewing Test Length ( cm ) : 184 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 116/75/102 14 VOLANT GRAVITY 71 $649 The all-metal topsheet on the Gravity 71 translates to a stable ride , but unlike Volants of seasons past , that does n't mean stable like the Titanic . The company has put its skis on a diet , shedding metal sidewall material for more pop . It worked , but short turns still require more effort than non-Volant skiers expect . Take the 71 out cruising big arcs in bowls . GRIPES : Testers thought the skis lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful loads ( think Jeremy Nobis ) . PROPS : Vibration-free in all conditions . TESTER 'S TAKE : " The Gravity 's steady personality is like a dependable friend . "  --  Megan McGrath Test Lengths ( cm ) : 175 , 180 Tip/Waist/Tail ( mm ) : 108/71/98 , 108/72/99 15 VLKL 7 24 PRO $1,050 ( INCLUDES COMP 1400 EPS BINDING BY MARKER ) Vlkl 's new midfat is representative of one of the best trends in all-terrain skis  --  wider waists ( 77 mm compared to last year 's 74 mm ) with deeper sidecuts . Even with the extra girth , we found the 7 24 Pro livelier than many others in the category . You can ski left turns in junk and right turns on groomers and never break your rhythm . GRIPES : You will still work hard for quick turns in bumps . PROPS : Super snappy , with excellent rebound . TESTER 'S TAKE : " You can ski so fast your clothes will fly off . "  --  Heather Schultz Test Lengths ( cm ) : 177 , 184 Tip/Waist/Tail ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THERE ANY DISADVANTAGES TO TWIN TIPS ? They absolutely bite when it comes to gondolas , whose ski holders were designed for flat tails , but you try to thrust your twin tips in anyway and one goes in but the other ca n't fit so it falls out , and , while the gondola moves relentlessly toward lift-off and the lifties shriek , you jam the other ski into the snowboard bin , where it clatters to and fro and bangs into lift towers all the way up . On snow , twin tips work fine .
