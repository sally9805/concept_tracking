Yes , reciting epic Greek poetry such as Homer 's Iliad and Odyssey actually seems to be good for the heart  --  at least according to a new study by a team of European researchers . It all has to do with breathing patterns and their relationship to cardiac rhythms . It turns out that reciting poetry  --  especially verse like Homer 's that follows a specific rhythm called hexameter  --  makes an excellent breathing exercise . The authors of the study taught healthy volunteers to recite passages from Homer while walking and lifting their arms with each breath . The result was an increase in the synchronization of certain cardiorespiratory patterns that are believed to be favorable to the long-term prognosis of cardiac patients . There was less of this synchronization with controlled-breathing exercises alone and almost none during normal , spontaneous breathing . Whether or not you like the poetry probably does n't matter .  --  By David Bjerklie
