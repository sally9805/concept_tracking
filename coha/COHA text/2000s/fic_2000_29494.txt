By midnight , Church Avenue in Brooklyn was almost a dead artery . An old Chevy dragged its muffler down the middle of the street , and the sound echoed like tin cans falling in a canyon . Sodium street lights shined down on corrugated iron gates in front of a liquor store , a nail salon , and a shop specializing in wigs made from Real 100% Humas Hair . Only a check-cashing place was still open , with blue neon in the window and a giant dollar bill on the sign out front . Across the street , two men sat in a bruised red ' 88 Plymouth , watching the door and the movement behind the window . " Ayna hoa , " said the one behind the wheel , a big bear of a man with an onion dome bald head , a heavy graying beard , and tinted aviator glasses . " Where is this guy ? My ass is getting asleep . " " That 's not a real expression , is it ? " said Nasser , sitting beside him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , switching back to Arabic . " It means you 're tired of waiting . " They looked like father and son , sitting there . Youssef was muscular but going to flab . A long crimson scar was visible though the buttons at the top of his shirt and the tails were out over the gun in his waistband . Nasser , who was now 22 , had grown up thin and tense , with liquid brown eyes , soft prim-looking lips and an accidental hint of Elvis Presley in his pompadour . Thus far in his life , he had n't been able to grow more than a weedy little beard to make himself look devout , so he 'd just decided to stay clean-shaven . A rusty key dangled from a chain around his neck . " Maybe we should go , " he said . " We 're not goinganywhere , " said Youssef , the Great Bear . " Remember what this is about . This is about jihad . " " Yes , I know about jihad . " Nasser chewed his fingernails . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why this is a Holy War here . This just seems like stealing . " " Everything is jihad . " Youssef nudged him with his elbow . " Everything you do from when you get up in the morning . If you have a cup of Turkish coffee , instead of the instant American kind , this is jihad . If you tell a brother about the Holy Book , this is jihad . If you turn off a television , this is jihad in the mind . But the greatest thing you can do for jihad is to fight . Remember one hour on the battlefield is worth a hundred years of prayer . " " I know . " " What we 're doing here is like the caravan raids from the olden days , after the hijra . The Prophet himself allowed this . " Nasser took his fingers from his mouth . He wondered if this was wise , what they were about to do . Yes , Youssef could cite verses , whole suras , to support it , but words could be twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Ca n't we raise the funds another way ? Is n't this haram ? " " Of course it 's not haram . " Youssef started to shrug but then suddenly grabbed Nasser 's arm . " Okay , it 's him , " he said in a low heated voice . " This is the one we follow . " He leaned across Nasser 's lap and pointed out a tall , thin Rastafarian in a camouflage jacket and a green knit cap , shambling up the street . The man walked with a lopping rhythm , as if there were music only he could hear . " He always comes late , this one , " said Youssef . " I 've been watching . It 's because he smokes the marijuana . I am sure of this . That 's why he 's never on time to relieve the one behind the counter . He 's a pig , I tell you , this one . I 've seen the way he eats . The jerk chicken and the jerk pork . Uch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Nasser sat there , watching the Rastaman a moment , trying to hear the music . Then trying to imagine the man eating pork and smoking marijuana . Trying to work up some hatred for him . The Rastaman went into the check-cashing store . " Come on , let 's go . " The Great Bear reached for the door handle . " Remember what you 're supposed to do and nobody gets hurt . When he opens the door to go behind the counter , we go in after him . " A passing livery cab almost sideswiped Youssef as he got out and put on a baseball cap with an X on it . Nasser put on his own X cap and climbed out on the passenger side , squeezing between two car bumpers to get to the curb . The .22 caliber pistol felt like a brick in the pocket of his maroon vinyl windbreaker . He watched the glass door open and saw Youssef follow the Rastaman into the check cashing place , the bear pursuing a hound dog . Nasser hesitated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night enfolding him . He wondered how many blocks it was to the nearest subway station . His nerve . Where was his nerve ? He saw the cracked glass door swing shut behind the Great Bear . Then he reached inside his shirt and fingered the key hanging from the chain around his neck , knowing he had no choice . With blood pounding in his ears , he moved quickly across the pavement , pulled the door open , and stepped inside . The check-cashing place was little more than a twelve-by-twenty room with scuffed black-and-white linoleum floors , scrappy woodpaneled walls , and a little stall in the corner for local jewelry-makers and incense sellers to peddle their wares . A bald-headed black man in shirt sleeves counted money behind a smudged bullet-proof glass partition . There was a tinge of ammonia and marijuana in the air and a radio was playing a raucous reggae song with a deep-voiced hectoring singer , a walrus of sound . The Rastaman in the green knit cap was knocking on the chipped wooden door next to the glass partition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . Nasser prepared to reach for his gun . But then the door behind him opened and a stout young woman in a red beret entered the storefront , pushing a little boy in a strollerno more than two years old , wearing tiny black Nikes and a sheriff 's badge made from tin foil . Nasser froze , looking at the woman and the child . What were they doing here so late ? The place was supposed to be empty at this hour . He looked over at Youssef , expecting a signal to change their plan , but Youssef was standing at a tall side-table a few feet away , studiously ignoring him and pretending to sign a check . " So I tried your remedy and I feel much better now , " the woman approached the Rastaman . " But that aloe vera , it 's disgusting . " " What did you do , child ? Swallow it ? " The Rastaman parted his hands . " You mean , I was supposed to rub it on ? " The Rastaman laughed and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then everything changed . Time seemed to expand and contract simultaneously . The chipped door opened . The woman with the stroller bent down to tie the baby 's Nikes . Nasser saw Youssef pull back his shirt tails and reach for his gun . Ile had to remind himself to breathe . Youssef was charging at the Rastaman and pushing him through the partly opened door some ten feet away , shouting : " Open the cash drawer or someone will get hurt ! " Back in the main room , Nasser took out his gun and pointed it at the woman reluctantly , tentatively , as if they both knew he had no intention of using it . He thought of saying something to reassure her , but decided against itYoussef would be too angry . Instead , he stared at the little boy 's tin foil badge , with its five points , wondering how long it took the woman to make it . Then he heard the shot in the room behind the glass . A ferocious little sound like a balloon bursting . Part of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer . The air closed in around his ears . The woman with the baby started to scream , knowing someone was dead . Nasser tried to say something to comfort her , but then the gun in the other room went off again . He moved quickly into the doorway and saw the Rastaman splayed across the floor like a rag doll , arms and legs tossed around him , head turned , blood staining the front of his camouflage jacket and puddling on the floor next to him . Youssef was pulling the bills out of the cash drawer and stufffing them into the little blue laundry bag he 'd had folded up in his back pocket . He did n't see the bald black man in shirt sleeves rising up behind him , his face covered in blood , pulling out a small silver handgun . Nasser saw his own hand rise with the .22 , as if floating up through water . The impulse to squeeze the trigger came from somewhere besides his brain . The gun jumped and bucked in his hand and the noise bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black man 's head flew off as he wobbled , fell against a stool , and slid down to the floor , still holding his gun . An angry black-red splatter remained on the wall panel behind him , with long spindly lines dripping down . The woman in the other room scrambled , trying to get out the front door with the baby in the stroller . Nothing in her life had prepared her for this moment . Whereas everything had prepared Nasser . It was his destiny to be here and to do the things that would come afterwards . So why did he still find himself paralyzed ? Youssef finished with the money , passed Nasser in the doorway , and came back into the main room . The woman turned away , not daring to face at him . She understood that looking at either of them meant death . But it was too late . Youssef stepped up calmly and shot her in the side of the head . She fell away from life , without even a chance to look back at her baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , not at all part of the natural order . He knew these people were infidels and deserved to die , but he could n't help himself . When Youssef turned the gun toward the boy , who was screaming in his stroller , Nasser gently nudged him from behind . " Come on , sheik , we have to go , " he said . Two minutes later , as the car sped down Flatbush Avenue , Nasser still kept feeling the kick and burn of the gun in his hand . Slowly he tried to get back into the proper flow of time again . He fingered the key on the chain around his neck as headlights washed over the windshield and police sirens sounded from far away . " Do n't worry , my friend , they are not following us , " said Youssef , one hand on the wheel , the other fumbling for the little amber bottle of nitroglycerin pills in his shirt pocket . " We are going home . " " What happened ? " " What do you mean ' happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think I 'm going to throw up . I do n't have a chance to count yet , but I 'm sure we have enough to finance the next stage . " Nasser realized he was still trembling from the force of events . " Sheik , " he said , using the word the way Americans called each other " sir . " " There 's something I have to ask you . " " What ? " " Were you really going to shoot him ? The little boy . " " This is jihad . " The Great Bear stared straight ahead into the on-coming traffic . " If it was God 's will , I would have . " " But I was the one who pushed you out of there . " Nasser let go of the key and looked once over his shoulder , to make sure they were n't being pursued . Youssef shrugged . " Then that was God 's will too . "                  @ @ @
