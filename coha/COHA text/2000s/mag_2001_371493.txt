It sounded like a good idea when New York City 's Mayor , Rudolph Giuliani , advised New Yorkers last week to get a flu shot . After all , 20,000 Americans each year die of influenza . And this year in particular , the mayor suggested , getting a flu shot might be an especially good idea , since it could help doctors distinguish between flu and the deadly inhalational form of anthrax . How ? Both anthrax and flu exhibit strikingly similar symptoms  --  fever , chills and muscle aches  --  in the early days of the infection . Physicians would be quick to suspect anthrax in anyone who was vaccinated against flu and still developed fever and chills . That would give them a better chance to identify any new victims of terror while their infection was still in its earliest , most treatable stages . <P> Or so the mayor 's reasoning went . Unfortunately , there are a couple of problems with his logic . For one thing , getting vaccinated against influenza does n't guarantee you wo n't get sick . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant strains and even then does not provide 100% protection . It takes a couple of weeks for your body to respond to the vaccine with a sufficient number of antibodies . Each year thousands of people who get the vaccine nevertheless still get the flu . <P> There are also plenty of reasons you might develop fever , chills and muscle aches that have nothing to do with either anthrax or flu . Indeed , doctors estimate that more than 80% of all flulike ailments each winter are caused by other groups of viruses , like the parainfluenza and picornavirus families . Getting vaccinated against flu ca n't protect you against suffering from these other respiratory ailments . <P> In the worst case , asking all healthy adults to get vaccinated could actually backfire , leading to even more deaths if it means we run out of shots for those who are most vulnerable to the infection . Already there have been delays in getting this year 's shipment of vaccine to clinics and doctors ' offices . Those who should be at the front of the line include folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children with chronic health problems , including asthma , kidney disease , heart disease and diabetes , as well as anyone who cares for or lives with such people . Flu shots are also important for men and women whose immune system is weakened by HIV or other conditions . <P> The best reason to get the flu vaccine is that it protects against most flus  --  not that you 're worried about contracting anthrax . While inhalational anthrax has killed only four people so far , many more could be at risk from flu-related complications . There 's no need to compound the tragedy by making this year 's influenza epidemic any worse . <P> See Dr. Ian on NBC 's Today show . E-mail your questions to him :
