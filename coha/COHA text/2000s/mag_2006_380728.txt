Renouncing one 's Muslim faith in Afghanistan is a crime punishable by death . When news trickled out of Kabul late last month that a former aid worker named Abdul Rahman , 41 , was on trial for converting to Christianity , the U.S. government responded with dismay  --  but not much else . The case " is not under the competence of the U.S. , " Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns said . " If there is to be a trial , we hope that it 's going to be transparent . " That was the diplomatic equivalent of shrugging and saying , " What more can we do ? " <P> The answer came swiftly from President Bush 's outraged Christian base : a lot more . Religious leaders in the U.S. assailed the White House , with activists like Jay Sekulow  --  who helped rally support for Bush 's Supreme Court nominees  --  bombarding Karl Rove 's evangelical liaison with e-mail . Within 48 hours , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had called Afghan President Hamid Karzai and urged Afghanistan 's Foreign Minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush declared , " We have got influence in Afghanistan , and we are going to use it to remind them that there are universal values . " A White House official insists that " our displeasure could not have been made clearer . " <P> Still , the right-wing furor over the Rahman case is likely to reverberate . To many Americans , the fact that Christian converts face prosecution in a country " liberated " by the U.S. in 2002 has bolstered the perception that the divide between Islam and the West is growing . Ansarullah Mawlavezada , the judge in charge of Rahman 's fate , defends the independence of the Afghan judiciary . " In the West you allow two women to get married because that is the law , and I respect that . In Afghanistan we have Shari'a law , and the people respect and accept this , " he told TIME last week . " Shari'a law is very clear . " Perhaps , but how it can coexist with Western values is not .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
