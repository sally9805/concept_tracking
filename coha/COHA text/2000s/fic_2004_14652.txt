A STREET  --  a former mercantile area ; young professionals renovating lofts . Part of a large dumpster juts in from the side , spilling over with the guts of an old sweatshop . The legs and backs of several chairs stick out . SANDLER , mid-30s , sits by the dumpster in a chair pulled from it . He is leaning forward , elbows on knees , slowly rotating an unopened pack of Winstons between the thumb and middle finger of one hand , tapping one end against the opposite palm , turning the pack , tapping , turning , his face vacant . He wears an old t-shirt and work pants , his arms are huge , his appearance weathered . Apart from turning the cigarette pack , he is eerily still . SPODE , also mid-30s , strolls past along the sidewalk and disappears behind the dumpster . He re-appears to stare at the chairs sticking up . He 's an intense , agitated , halting man with a fringe of hair around a growing bald spot . He wears thick glasses . SPODE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours ? SANDLER ( half turn ) This ? ( " no . " ) Help yourself . SPODE Sandler ? SANDLER ( turns ) Spode ? ! SANDLER half rises and they shake hands , an awkward greeting . p. 3 SPODE What are you doing at this end of the street ? SANDLER Sitting . You ' round here somewhere ? SPODE ( points over audience ) Third floor . SANDLER With the light on ? SPODE ( nods ) So who belongs to ( re : the dumpster ) this ? SANDLER Your end of the block , you tell me . SPODE Unbelievable , is n't it . Even businesses opening . A hair stylist . A Buddhist Study Center down that way . SANDLER With the yellow windows ? What is that , painting your display window solid yellow ? SPODE So you ca n't see in . SANDLER You ca n't see out , either . What do they , just sit in-side and look at yellow all day . SPODE It stops desire . One of ' em told me that . SANDLER Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a Buddhist thing , I guess . BOTH smile , mostly to themselves.So these chairs are up for grabs ? No one 'll mind if I take one ? What the hell , it 's my street , right . We 're pioneers here . Kind of exciting to watch the block change in front of your eyes . p. 4 SANDLER ( flat ) Very stimulating . SPODE Are you out here for ( how to put it )  --  any particular reason ? SANDLER is turning his cigarette pack , tap-tap-tap , turn , tap-tap-tap , turn He nods . SANDLER How 's Beck ? SPODE Rebecca ? Fine . Great . How 's  --  ( forgets the name )  --  your wife , ( remembers ) Marty . SANDLER Marina . Mari . ( Mah-ree ) SANDLER checks his watch . SPODE Me , too . Insomnia . Gets real quiet around here . SANDLER It gets real quiet everywhere at 3:00 AM . SPODE Especially here . A neighborhood like this . If you call it a neighborhood when there 's no neighbors . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is changing , though . Paid 30 for the loft . You bought yours , too , did n't you ? Couple years we may be sitting on a gold mine ! SANDLER ( seeing SPODE 's restlessness ) Do you want to sit down ? SPODE No shortage of chairs ! SPODE reaches up and moves chairs around . p. 5 SANDLER Is your wife awake ? ( indicates the window ) The light ? SPODE ( still selecting a seat ) She has to argue a big case next week , major preparation . Late night 's the only time she has to herself . After Danny 's asleep . After I put him to bed . Cook dinner and put him to bed . Actually , I give him his bath and read him a story before I put him to bed . Then wash the dinner dishes . He barely hears himself , so busy is he with taking down the chair he found . SANDLER Hard life being a mom , huh ? SPODE ( positioning the chair ) Oh naw , we 're , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( flat ) Good for you ! SPODE Actually , we kind of we just had a  --  tense exchange . ( SANDLER laugh ) Is that funny ? SANDLER Are n't we a couple of prize fucking specimens . SPODE ( realizes , almost relieved ) You , too ? You and Marty fought ? Is that why you 're out here ? SANDLER I thought the loft was enormous until me and her started going at it . p. 6 SPODE I hate little DanDan to hear us yell . Becky does n't care . She gets angry , she just snaps , bang ; does n't care who 's around . It 's scary for a kid . Hell , it scares me sometimes . SANDLER is vacant again , turning his smokes , tap-tap , turn SPODE is uneasy . Then : SANDLER Can I ask you something ? SPODE Like , a personal question ? ( beat : ) How personal are we talking about ? SPODE is wary  --  but polite . SANDLER ( beat ) Do you fuck around ? After the briefest hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPODE This one 's wobbly . ( looks in DUMPSTER ) Have you already looked through all these ? One of ' em has to be  --  maybe the Buddhist center could use some chairs . Maybe we should set them by the door , kind of a Welcome to the Neighborhood . He sets down a folding wooden chair , sits . SANDLER ( pause ) Should I withdraw my question ? SPODE ( uneasy ) The thing is , I find it  --  you really want to get into this ? Even if we knew each other well , it 's kind of  --  not that we 're strangers . Fellow pioneers , and all . Neighbors ; but still  --  p. 7 SANDLER ( simply ) My mistress is pregnant . I just found out this afternoon . She 's carrying my kid . SPODE is reduced to baffled silence , his mind darting like a fish on a hook , trying to shake free . SPODE ( avoiding ) " Mistress . " That sounds odd . Formal , you know ? Old fashioned . SANDLER What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular basis ? SPODE " This woman I 'm seeing ? " Or use the name ; Terry . Lynette . Danielle . SANDLER ( grins ) Well , which ? SPODE Which what ? SANDLER Which one are you seeing ? SPODE I do n't feel comfortable with this conversation , Sandler . I 'm sorry , I do n't feel comfortable with  --  If you really need to talk to someone , why not call a friend ? SANDLER At three in the morning ? SPODE There 's a bar just across 4th . It 's open all night . If it 's a question of talking SANDLER I 've been dry two years . A bar would n't be the best idea . Not tonight . SPODE Maybe the Buddhists do n't they know about stuff like this , problems ? Are n't they like a church , you can knock any time ? Hey , maybe that 's why they chose a street like this , full of people in the thick of it , buying property , renovating , striving , guarenteed disappointment  --  ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ring the bell . p. 8 SANDLER Relax . I 've said what I needed to . Gabriella 's pregnant . Thanks for listening . SPODE ( beat : ) You 're welcome . ( beat : ) Have you told Marty ? SANDLER " Mari . " SPODE Have you ? SANDLER Are we talking about this now ? Of course I have n't told her . Have you told Becky you fuck around ? SPODE Why do you keep saying that ? What makes you think I sleep around ? SANDLER looks at him . SANDLER All right , forget it . SPODE If she knew she 'd throw me out the door  --  right out . SANDLER ( looking across he street ) Is that her in the window ? SPODE looks up , his face expressionless . He waves . He drops his hand . SANDLER looks up.Full moon . ( smiles ) Stray wolves waiting for shelter , that 's us . All the books she gives me to read , but you know what , under everything , fuck feminism , they hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either open the door , or slam it in our face . SANDLER turns his pack , tap-tap , turn . p. 9 SPODE Are you going to smoke those ? I could use one . SANDLER ( opening the pack ) She came to the window . Maybe she 's ready to kiss and make up . SPODE ( glancing at his window ) She 's not the kiss-and-make-up type . She 's the **57;3457;TOOLONG type . I 'll wait 'll the light goes out . Slip in quietly . SANDLER Marina would keep the kid if I left her , that 's the problem . I love my daughter . SPODE She 's yours ? I thought  --  my wife said SANDLER I did n't make her . The father 's upstate doing 15 to 20 . And Mari some women do n't want to be moms , you know . They can crank out a kid but after that  --  Whereas Gabriella ( smiles ) My " mistress "  --  she was born for motherhood . One look and you know . Soft all over ; she actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of strawberry shortcake . Does n't want a thing from me , either ; no demands . The baby 's enough for her . ( trying to work it out : ) If only I could take my kid , move in with Gabriella , then when she had our kid the four of us could live together  --  it would actually be best for everyone , even my wife . Except she 'd never , I do n't think she 'd ever He taps out cigarettes , hands one to SPODE. p. 10 SPODE I hope this is not a serious idea , Sandler . You 're not seriously suggesting your wife give up her child to be raised by you and your fuck-of-the-moment . SANDLER I love Gabriella . SPODE " The woman you love . " " Your mistress . " SANDLER Of course I love Mari , too , but mostly I love her kid . Which is why she married me , in part . She saw I was a good dad , which is something , I guess  --  that she cared enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I explain all this to myself , about Mari , about her needs as a high strung , talented artist , beautiful in ways that make men not take her seriously as an artist is how she explains it to me  --  and I do get this beautiful kid out of the deal . I 'm crazy about her , I 'm her dad , really , and for five years it 's been enough , even when Mari leaves the loft all day to go  --  I do n't even know what she does all day ; art galleries , lunch with friends , part time jobs I 'm just guessing she hates when I ask where she 's been . SANDLER lights their cigarettes.Sometimes after a day with the kid , and we 're having a really good time , she 'll get home and make dinner , then she 'll fly into this rage over having to do everything around the house , which she in fact does do sometimes , she 'll spend a whole day playing super-mom , doing house work , then she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned our life together until Gabriella came along and  --  how come women have such power to make you feel , I do n't know Loved . Valued . And then exact opposite . He inhales deeply . He ponders his state.Since I met Gabriella , Mari seems like a witch . That 's totally unfair , of course . She never promised to be a good wife . Or mother . We just fell in love , the way you do . Got married . Which has to mean something , a vow like that , you have to honor it , right ? Hell , maybe I 'm a bad husband , who knows . I 'm a good dad , okay , but  --  ( beat : ) What happens to the kid if I leave ? p. 11 SPODE Can I say something here SANDLER ( distant ) I never yelled at Mari till Gabriella came along . That 's not fair , either . Just cause your mistress makes you feel good about yourself SPODE Okay , we 're talking now . Here 's my advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , do the best you can by her , but have another affair as fast as you can , and another one after that , and the minute they get tricky , get out . Fuck around to have fun , there 's no other reason . If it gets heavy and complicated you might as well have a second wife . SANDLER Rules to Live By ? SPODE More an ideal . Like anyone , I fall sort . Having a mistress takes practice . In America , anyway . In Europe you 're born knowing how . SANDLER ( chuckling ) That 's wild . I did n't really think you screwed around . I was joking before . You always struck me as this sort of knotted-up city engineer type with a harpy wife  --  SPODE A pussy-whipped geek , you mean ? SANDLER laughs loudly . SANDLER ( nods ) In fact . SPODE ( irked ) Well , you always struck me as a beer and poker and check your brains at the door kinda guy , so there ya go . He went too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to SPODE slowly . Then he laughs . p. 12 SANDLER Fair enough . SPODE A night of revelations . ( agitated ) This Buddhist place , it 's really bothering me all of a sudden . Why 'd they choose our street . Did Buddha send a message , Highland 's a promising place to set up shop , full of restless young professionals craving inner calm ? He jiggles his chair in place.Good chair . SANDLER ( watching SPODE with new interest ) You always have another woman on the side ? SPODE There are gaps . SANDLER ( genuine ) What if you got one pregnant ? What of one of ' em fell in love with you ? SPODE I wear a ring . They know the deal . They tend to be intelligent , interesting women on the whole . Unconventional . Independent . Or very screwed up . Either way , interesting . Okay , I guess we 're getting into this , so  --  between you and me , my wife is a totally remarkable woman who I love with all my heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Dan-Dan . But she does n't really like to be around us , you know ? She likes having us in her life . But not spending time with us . She likes to be on her own . Or in court , terrorizing her opponent . I respect that . But for me and Danny , it 's kind of like living by ourselves most of the time . So I 'll get needy , and intense and this look , she says I get this kind of wounded accusatory look when she wants to be alone , like I think she 's failing me , us , in some way , which I do feel , but I know it 's my fault that I feel that way , cause she can only be what she is , not what I want her to be , and with a kid in the picture you do n't walk away . So , I screw around . That takes care of the itchy-flesh and ego-recharge stuff , and here 's the interesting thing  --  Beck seems to intuit when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming off me , I do n't know , it 's a mystery , maybe she feels off the hook , but anyway she acts a lot nicer , and I love her even more even fantasize being with Beck when I 'm with a " mistress . " God , that 's a nice word . I mean , you do your best as a man , right . God knows there must be things she 's not getting from me . But that 's her problem , right ? She finds a way . ( beat : ) It 's when these women leave me , that 's when the trouble starts . When I 'm all alone again . Just me and Danny . p. 13 SANDLER ( sudden comprehension ) Someone left you ? ! That 's why you 're out here ? Is that why ? SPODE Joanne . Jo . She met a guy . He reminds her of me . Not as good in bed , she says . But all hers . So I need another lady , like real soon . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet even on the phone , she could hold the receiver against her body  --  ( he stops : ) This is some conversation ! He is fighting tears . SANDLER waits . SANDLER Us out here . Them in there . ( shakes his head ) Three in the morning . SPODE Kind of funny , actually . ( changing the subject ) Can you believe anyone would throw out perfectly good chairs  --  SANDLER You okay ? SPODE nods . SANDLER looks across the street .  --  Look ; your light 's out . Home free . SPODE Yeah SANDLER Hey , good luck finding a new  --  ( what to call it ? ) SPODE " Mistress " SANDLER ( smiles ) Mistress . SPODE You , too . Soon as you can . Only way to go . p. 14 SANDLER Do n't forget the chair . SPODE stares across the street . SPODE I could really use another one of those . If that 's okay with you . SANDLER taps out cigarettes , gives one to SPODE and they light up . He puts down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then MARSHALL enters , mid-30s , all in black , wiry and feral . MARSHALL Sandler , what the fuck are you doing out  --  never mind . Those your smokes ? He taps one out of the pack and lights up . SPODE I 'm Spode . MARSHALL I 've seen you on the block . ( an offhand introduction : ) Marshall . Mind if I join you ? Let 's not talk for a minute , okays ? I got ta get some ( towards the far end of the street : ) SHIT OUT OF MY HEAD ! He paces . ALL smoke . SANDLER and SPODE exchange a look of understanding . SANDLER lets out a howl , smiling to himself . SPODE looks at him and understands . SANDLER howls louder . SPODE joins in . MARSHALL looks at them as if they 're both nuts , but when they keep howling , it starts to feel sort of right and so he starts howling , too . And there THEY sit , howling away as The lights dim . And they keep smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
