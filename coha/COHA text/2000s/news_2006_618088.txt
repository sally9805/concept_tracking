<p> Response to " MTV 's ' My Super Sweet 16 ' show leaves sour taste , " AJC Gwinnett News , May 25 . <p> Show 's focus on spoiled kids demonstrates weakness in parents <p> That show is a perfect example of parents who would rather buy their kids ' " love " than work for it by actually learning what it means to be a good parent . Rather than spending quality time with their children , they would rather buy them off . They are also the types of parents who are less concerned with what their kids need than they are with one-upping the other rich parents at the country club . <p> These are parents who do n't care about teaching their kids what is really important in life , like working hard and ambition , but would rather have them grow up with the perception that all they have to do is EXIST and they are magically owed cars , cash , jewelry , clothes and anything else their little hearts desire . <p> As someone who could give my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the common sense and decency to know that spoiling your kids to that extreme only creates lazy brats with a sense of entitlement and indifference toward life . Watching that show even once proves that . <p> These kids are absolutely convinced that they deserve everything they could possibly want , no matter how extreme , and anything less than total satisfaction is completely unacceptable . <p> Even Donald Trump 's kids admit that they only got $300 a month to spend ( not much for them ) and if they wanted more , they worked for it . Maybe that is why they are both Wharton MBAs with top grades from the hardest business school on Earth . <p> Compare their outcomes to the Hilton sisters who grew up with everything handed out to them . Who would you rather have as YOUR kids ? Two Wharton MBAs who are working for their own success or two brats who will never put in a real day 's work in their lives and will spend their days humiliating your family name ? Can you guess which paths the " stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country will take ? <p> And shows like this just warp the minds of all the kids who watch it just as badly as the kids who star in it . Now kids all over the world who see that show are going to be disappointed with their parents ' meager showings on their 16th birthdays . <p> What 's that ? Daddy only bought you a Honda and not a Mercedes ? Well , you clearly are not as cool as the rest of us . . . . You just KNOW that 16-year-old kids ( girls especially , according to that show ) the world over are going into depression every time they watch that show because they get the impression that the girl on the show has the perfect life , gets everything she wants , and the poor girl watching it will never be so " lucky . " I can only hope she lives long enough to grow out of it and see who is REALLY the lucky one . <p> The " stars " of shows like this and all the other spoiled daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be 35 and have more silicon in them than Intel . They will be miserable , unhappy and on their second or third failed marriage after desperately trying to find rich men who could take the place of their daddies in their lives . <p> This is just going to up the ante of the pathetic parents more concerned about being their kids ' best friends and popularity promoters than their good , solid , straight-shooting moral compasses and loving guardians . <p> America needs less " Sweet 16 " parents and more people willing to let their kids sacrifice temporary popularity and materialism for the good of their work ethics , ambitions and priorities in life . <p> Wealthy parents need to learn how to say no . Apparently they do n't realize that all they are doing is ruining their kids ' lives and setting them up for disappointment after disappointment and teaching them that the only thing that matters in life is having more STUFF than everyone else . Yeah , we all know how happy and adjusted people with that attitude turn out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss for all Gwinnett <p> I am shocked and appalled at the firing of Jo Ann Pinder by the Gwinnett County Public Library board during its monthly meeting Monday evening . <p> Even during the meeting , no reason for this firing was stated . I understand that the director serves at the pleasure of the board , but this action is a slap in the face to the patrons of the library who not only have to foot the $127,000 cost of Ms. Pinder 's severance pay ( and the costs of the search process for a replacement ) but face the loss of this strong , knowledgeable professional as library director . <p> This is not Ms. Pinder 's loss  --  many library systems will undoubtedly be delighted that she 's available . This is the library system 's loss . This is our loss . <p> BECKY CUSTAR , Lilburn <p> Almost anyone but Kenerly will do <p> As the primary rapidly approaches , Commissioner Kevin Kenerly is again emerging from his cocoon to arrange for regular public bombardment of the great accomplishments of his regime . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us ( before we were mercifully redistricted out from under him ) , I spent many years repeatedly attempting to receive any sort of response from him regarding some very basic issues that were tantamount to " life and death " for us and our neighborhood . <p> I frequently asked for his assistance or at the very least merely his views on dealing with the explosion of gangs and graffiti and such , and I even invited him to our neighborhood meetings , but I received precisely zero direct responses to untold numbers of calls , letters and e-mails over the span of several years . <p> Sometimes " staff " was eventually dispatched to occasionally listen and ignore , but Mr. Kenerly is still the grand master of that realm  --  except when facing elections or specific questions that he chooses to address , apparently . <p> Very fortunately , we only need to count to " three " ( board of commissioners votes , that is ) in Gwinnett to get anything significant accomplished , and thus in light of the four other competent voices on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of things . <p> My main concern is that no real leadership or " value added " has ever been evident , and as such it seems he is unaware that constituents should be regularly listened to rather than just given the " smoke and mirrors " treatment every four years . It is my sincerest hope that District 4 will come to its collective senses and replace the last remaining " old-guard klinker " on the Board of commissioners . Almost anyone else will do . <p> PAUL ALLEN , Norcross <p> Snellville is just passing its molesters to other communities <p> A recent segment of " ABC Evening News " was devoted to the restrictions placed on released child molesters . <p> Restrictions normally include specific distances such people must stay away from places frequented by children such as playgrounds , parks , schools , churches , etc . <p> ABC spotlighted Snellville because the city fathers have imposed a 2,500-foot separation distance , which for all practical purposes dictates that child molesters can not live in Snellville . <p> Forcing them to move elsewhere poses two problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , and authorities likely will lose track of their whereabouts after moving . <p> Let 's face it  --  molesters ' arms are no longer and they can run no faster than the rest of us . So just how is 2,500 feet any safer than 500 feet ? <p> Get real , Snellville . Your obvious attempt to pass on your problem residents to other communities is as transparent as a windowpane . <p> Making life tough for molesters is only going to make them more dangerous . <p> JAY WAGNER , Stone Mountain <p> Investment required for progress <p> I am amazed that you printed Mr. Mohammad Zaheer 's absurd letter regarding Georgia Gwinnett College ( " Spending on Georgia Gwinnett College is shameful , " AJC Gwinnett News , June 12 ) since he obviously does not understand the elementary point that in order to achieve a significant result it is usually necessary to make an investment , sometimes of considerable amount , before any result is achieved . <p> As to his comments about the Gwinnett schools , they seem to be doing fairly well even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal , and are receiving virtually no help from the feds , whose refusal to enforce the immigration laws has created the problem . <p> ROBERT J. THOMAS , Lilburn <p> Singing anthem in Spanish is arrogant <p> I believe a previous letter writer , and perhaps a few others , missed the entire point over the objections to the singing of " The Star-Spangled Banner " in Spanish ( " Hispanics fought , died for U.S. , too , " AJC Gwinnett Opinions , May 21 ) . The public 's objections are based on illegal aliens starting to wave American flags and sing our national anthem in English only after  --  repeat , only after  --  they were criticized for waving the Mexican flag ( among other foreign flags ) and singing the Mexican national anthem among others while demonstrating in our streets demanding that we dismantle our nation 's immigration laws and grant them amnesty . <p> This " after-the-fact " change in their tactics to waving American flags and their sudden adoption of the American national anthem was taken as disdain for our national sovereignty , lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously insincere and taken as an insult . <p> I have no objection to the singing of our national anthem in Spanish or any other language when it is for language instruction or in a situation of respect and is not done in an in-your-face manner . Most Americans strongly believe that the recent occurrences were an in-your-face situation and were perceived as an implied threat of overcoming our English language and heritage . <p> The previous letter writer became quite unhinged when he substantially accused those of us who resent these acts against our national sovereignty as calling non-English speakers " dirty foreigners . " It is unfortunate that the letter writer is so uninformed that he appeared incapable of understanding that our objections are not against Hispanics but ALL illegal aliens , be they Mexican , Chinese , Irish or Canadian . <p> That letter writer unfortunately gave the impression , possibly unintended , that speaking English was not required to join our military . It most assuredly is . It 's a shame that supporters of illegal aliens are allowed to wrongly present this as a anti-Hispanic matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's language and our national sovereignty . <p> ERNEST WADE , Loganville <p> Check out Fair Tax book <p> If you are not familiar with " The Fair Tax , " a book by Congressman John Linder and Neal Boortz , explaining the new congressional bill eliminating all present federal taxes and replacing them with a national sales tax , you should be . It is the best idea I have ever heard come out of Washington . <p> Linder was to meet with President Bush to review it this week , and shortly afterward with the House leadership as well . <p> Check it out . You will love it and then support it . <p> RICK GEBELEIN , Braselton ( Gwinnett ) Photo : Kevin Kenerly Photo : VINO WONG / StaffRuel Morrison holds up a sign in support of Jo Ann Pinder during the Gwinnett County Public Library board of trustees meeting Monday night .
