Chapter One May 1996 " Tell me again why I agreed to help you with this . " Matt , red-faced and grunting , continued to push the spa toward the recently cut square at the far edge of the deck . His feet slipped , and he could feel sweat pouring from his forehead into the corners of his eyes , making them sting . It was hot , way too hot for early May . Too damn hot for this , that 's for sure . Even Travis 's dog , Moby , was hiding in the shade and panting , his tongue hanging out . Travis Parker , who was pushing the massive box alongside him , managed to shrug . " Because you thought it would be fun , " he said . He lowered his shoulder and shoved ; the spa-which must have weighed four hundred pounds-moved another couple of inches . At this rate , the spa should be in place , oh ... sometime next week . " This is ridiculous , " Matt said , heaving his weight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of mules . His back was killing him . For a moment , he visualized his ears blowing off the sides of his head from the strain , shooting in both directions like the bottle rockets he and Travis used to launch as kids . " You 've already said that . " " And it is n't fun , " Matt grunted . " You said that , too . " " And it is n't going to be easy to install . " " Sure it is , " Travis said . He stood and pointed to the lettering on the box . " See ? It says right here , ' Easy to Install . ' " From his spot beneath the shady tree , Moby-a purebred boxer-barked as if in agreement , and Travis smiled , looking way too pleased with himself . Matt scowled , trying to catch his breath . He hated that look . Well , not always . Most of the time he enjoyed his friend 's boundless enthusiasm . But not today . Definitely not today . Matt reached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat , which had of course done wonders for the seat of his pants . He wiped his face and wrung the bandanna with a quick twist . Sweat dribbled from it like a leaky faucet onto the top of his shoe . He stared at it almost hypnotically , before feeling it soak through the light mesh fabric , giving his toes a nice , slimy feel . Oh , that was just dandy , was n't it ? " As I recall , you said Joe and Laird would be here to help us with your ' little project ' and that Megan and Allison would cook some burgers and we 'd have beer , and that-oh yeah , installing this thing should only take a couple of hours at the most . " " They 're coming , " Travis said . " You said that four hours ago . " " They must be running a little late . " " Maybe you never called them at all . " " Of course I called them . And they 're bringing the kids , too . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Uh-huh , " Matt answered . He stuffed the bandanna back in his pocket . " And by the way-assuming they do n't arrive soon , just how on earth do you think the two of us will be able to lower this thing into place ? " Travis dismissed the problem with a wave as he turned toward the box again . " We 'll figure it out . Just think how well we 've done so far . We 're almost halfway there . " Matt scowled again . It was Saturday-Saturday ! His day of recreation and relaxation , his chance to escape from the grindstone , the break he earned after five days at the bank , the kind of day he needed . He was a loan officer , for God 's sake ! He was supposed to push paper , not hot tubs ! He could have been watching the Braves play the Dodgers ! He could have been golfing ! He could have gone to the beach ! He could have slept in with Liz before heading to her parents ' house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the crack of dawn and performing manual labor for eight straight hours beneath a scalding southern sun .... He paused . Who was he kidding ? Had he not been here , he would have definitely spent the day with Liz 's parents , which was , in all honesty , the main reason he 'd agreed to Travis 's request in the first place . But that was n't the point . The point was , he did n't need this . He really did n't . " I do n't need this , " he said . " I really do n't . " Travis did n't seem to hear him . His hands were already on the box , and he was getting into position . " You ready ? " Matt lowered his shoulder , feeling bitter . His legs were shaking . Shaking ! He already knew he 'd be in serious , double-dose-of- Advil pain in the morning . Unlike Travis , he did n't make it into the gym four days a week or play racquetball or go running or go scuba diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything else the guy did . " This is n't fun , you know ? " Travis winked . " You said that already , remember ? " " Wow ! " Joe commented , lifting an eyebrow as he walked the perimeter of the hot tub . By then , the sun was beginning its descent , streams of gold reflecting off the bay . In the distance , a heron broke from the trees and gracefully skimmed the surface , dispersing the light . Joe and Megan , along with Laird and Allison , had arrived a few minutes before with kids in tow , and Travis was showing them around . " This looks great ! You two did all of this today ? " Travis nodded , holding his beer . " It was n't so bad , " he said . " I think Matt even enjoyed it . " Joe glanced at Matt , who lay flattened in a lawn chair off to the side of the deck , a cold rag over his head . Even his belly-Matt had always been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Was it heavy ? " " Like an Egyptian sarcophagus ! " Matt croaked . " One of those gold ones that only cranes can move ! " Joe laughed . " Can the kids get in ? " " Not yet . I just filled it , and the water will take a little while to heat up . The sun will help , though . " " The sun will heat it within minutes ! " Matt moaned . " Within seconds ! " Joe grinned . Laird and the three of them had gone to school together since kindergarten . " Tough day , Matt ? " Matt removed the rag and scowled at Joe . " You have no idea . And thanks for showing up on time . " " Travis said to be here at five . If I had known you needed help , I would have come earlier . " Matt slowly shifted his gaze to Travis . He really hated his friend sometimes . " How 's Tina doing ? " Travis said , changing the subject . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Allison at the table on the far end of the deck , and Joe glanced briefly in her direction . " Some . Tina 's cough is gone and she 's been able to sleep through the night again , but sometimes I just think that Megan is n't wired to sleep . At least , not since she became a mom . She gets up even if Tina has n't made a peep . It 's like the quiet wakes her up . " " She 's a good mom , " Travis said . " She always has been . " Joe turned to Matt . " Where 's Liz ? " he asked . " She should be here any minute , " Matt answered , his voice floating up as if from the dead . " She spent the day with her parents . " " Lovely , " Joe commented . " Be nice . They 're good people . " " I seem to recall you saying that if you had to sit through one more of your father-in-law 's stories about his prostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired again- even though it was n't his fault-you were going to stick your head in the oven . " Matt struggled to sit up . " I never said that ! " " Yes , you did . " Joe winked as Matt 's wife , Liz , rounded the corner of the house with Ben toddling just in front of her . " But do n't worry . I wo n't say a word . " Matt 's eyes darted nervously from Liz to Joe and back again , checking to see if she 'd heard . " Hey , y'all ! " Liz called out with a friendly wave , leading little Ben by the hand . She made a beeline for Megan and Allison . Ben broke away and toddled toward the other kids in the yard . Joe saw Matt sigh in relief . He grinned and lowered his voice . " So ... Matt 's in-laws . Is that how you conned him into coming here ? " " I might have mentioned it , " Travis smirked . Joe laughed . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing , " they said in unison . Later , with the sun down and the food eaten , Moby curled up at Travis 's feet . As he listened to the sound of the kids splashing away in the spa , Travis felt a wave of satisfaction wash over him . This was his favorite kind of evening , whiled away to the sound of shared laughter and familiar banter . One minute Allison was talking to Joe ; the next minute she was chatting with Liz and then Laird or Matt ; and so on for everyone seated around the outdoor table . No pretenses , no attempts to impress , no one trying to show anyone up . His life , he sometimes thought , resembled a beer commercial , and for the most part , he was content simply to ride the current of good feeling . Every now and then , one of the wives would get up to check on the kids . Laird , Joe , and Matt , on the other hand , reserved their child-rearing duties at times like these to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids or preventing them from teasing or accidentally hurting one another . Sure , one of the kids would throw a tantrum now and then , but most problems were solved with a quick kiss on a scraped knee or a hug that was as tender to watch from a distance as it must have been for the kid to receive . Travis looked around the table , pleased that his childhood friends not only had become good husbands and fathers , but were still a part of his life . It did n't always turn out that way . At thirty-two , he knew that life was sometimes a gamble , and he 'd survived more than his share of accidents and falls , some of which should have inflicted far more serious bodily injury than they had . But it was n't just that . Life was unpredictable . Others he 'd known growing up had already died in car accidents , been married and divorced , found themselves addicted to drugs or booze , or simply moved away from this tiny town , their faces already blurring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them-who 'd known one another since kindergarten-would find themselves in their early thirties still spending weekends together ? Pretty small , he thought . But somehow , after hanging together through all the adolescent acne and girl troubles and pressure from their parents , then heading off to four different colleges with differing career goals , they had each , one by one , moved back here to Beaufort . They were more like family than friends , right down to coded expressions and shared experiences that no outsiders could ever fully understand . And miraculously , the wives got along , too . They 'd come from different backgrounds and different parts of the state , but marriage , motherhood , and the endless gossip of small-town America were more than enough to keep them chatting regularly on the phone and bonding like long-lost sisters . Laird had been the first to marry-he and Allison had tied the knot the summer after they graduated from Wake Forest ; Joe and Megan walked the aisle a year later , after falling in love during their senior year at North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liz here in Beaufort , and they were married a year after that . Travis had been the best man in all three weddings . Some things had changed in the past few years , of course , largely because of the new additions to the families . Laird was n't always available to go mountain biking , Joe could n't join Travis on the spur of the moment to go skiing in Colorado as he used to , and Matt had all but given up trying to keep up with him on most things . But that was okay . They were all still available enough , and among the three of them - and with enough planning-he was still able to make the most of his weekends . Lost in thought , Travis had n't realized that the conversation had lapsed . " Did I miss something ? " " I asked if you 'd talked to Monica lately , " Megan said , her tone letting Travis know he was in trouble . All six of them , he thought , took a bit too much interest in his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to believe that everyone they knew should get married . Every woman Travis dated was thus subjected to subtle , though unyielding , evaluation , especially by Megan . She was usually the ringleader at moments like these , always trying to figure out what made Travis tick when it came to women . And Travis , of course , loved nothing more than to push her buttons in return . " Not recently , " he said . " Why not ? She 's nice . " She 's also more than a little neurotic , Travis thought . But that was beside the point . " She broke up with me , remember ? " " So ? It does n't mean she does n't want you to call . " " I thought that 's exactly what it meant . " Megan , along with Allison and Liz , stared at him as if he were just plain dense . The guys , as usual , seemed to be enjoying this . It was a regular feature of their evenings . " But you were fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she might have simply broken up with you because she was angry ? " " I was angry , too . " " Why ? " " She wanted me to see a therapist . " " And let me guess-you said you did n't need to see one . " " The day I need to see a therapist is the day you see me hike up my skirt and crochet some mittens . " Joe and Laird laughed , but Megan 's eyebrows shot up . Megan , they all knew , watched Oprah nearly every day . " You do n't think men need therapy ? " " I know I do n't . " " But generally speaking ? " " Since I 'm not a general , I really could n't say . " Megan leaned back in her chair . " I think Monica might be on to something . If you ask me , I think you have commitment issues . " " Then I 'll make sure not to ask you . " Megan leaned forward . " What 's the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ? " Travis pondered the question . " I dated Olivia for almost a year . " " I do n't think she 's talking about high school , " Laird cracked . Occasionally , his friends enjoyed throwing him under the bus , so to speak . " Thanks , Laird , " Travis said . " What are friends for ? " " You 're changing the subject , " Megan reminded him . Travis drummed his fingers on his leg . " I guess I 'd have to say ... I ca n't remember . " " In other words , not long enough to remember ? " " What can I say ? I 've yet to meet any woman who could measure up to any of you . " Despite the growing darkness , he could tell she was pleased by his words . He 'd learned long ago that flattery was his best defense at moments like these , especially since it was usually sincere . Megan , Liz , and Allison were terrific . All heart and loyalty and generous common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " she said . " Yeah , but you like everyone I date . " " No , I do n't . I did n't like Leslie . " None of the wives had liked Leslie . Matt , Laird , and Joe , on the other hand , had n't minded her company at all , especially when she wore her bikini . She was definitely a beauty , and while she was n't the type he 'd ever marry , they 'd had a lot of fun while it lasted . " I 'm just saying that I think you should give her a call , " she persisted . " I 'll think about it , " he said , knowing he would n't . He rose from the table , angling for an escape . " Anyone need another beer ? " Joe and Laird lifted their bottles in unison ; the others shook their heads . Travis started for the cooler before hesitating near the sliding glass door of his house . He darted inside and changed the CD , listening to the strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the beers back to the table . By then , Megan , Allison , and Liz were already chatting about Gwen , the woman who did their hair . Gwen always had good stories , many of which concerned the illicit predilections of the town 's citizens . Travis nursed his beer silently , looking out over the water . " What are you thinking about ? " Laird asked . " It 's not important . " " What is it ? " Travis turned toward him . " Did you ever notice how some colors are used for people 's names but others are n't ? " " What are you talking about ? " " White and Black . Like Mr. White , the guy who owns the tire store . And Mr. Black , our third-grade teacher . Or even Mr. Green from the game Clue . But you never hear of someone named Mr. Orange or Mr. Yellow . It 's like some colors make good names , but other colors just sound stupid . You know what I mean ? " " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me neither . Not until just a minute ago , I mean . But it 's kind of strange , is n't it ? " " Sure , " Laird finally agreed . Both men were quiet for a moment . " I told you it was n't important . " " Yes , you did . " " Was I right ? " " Yep . " (
