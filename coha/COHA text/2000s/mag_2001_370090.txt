Ruth Reichl remembers the uproar when her biting 1993 story about how unknowns are treated at the chic Le Cirque restaurant appeared in the New York Times . " As my husband said , you 'd think I 'd exposed police corruption , " she says . Now editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine , Reichl made her reputation by chronicling not just the sensory attributes of food but its emotional and psychosocial qualities as well . She brings those same skills to writing about her life in Comfort Me with Apples : More Adventures at the Table ( Random House ; 302 pages ; $24.95 ) . <P> The stories in both her memoirs ( a widely praised predecessor , Tender at the Bone : Growing Up at the Table , came out in 1998 ) are delicious reads : witty , reflective accounts of her experiences in , around and through food . They are perfectly balanced meals accompanied by recipes : the shrimp curry she cooks as a farewell to her Berkeley commune , the mushroom soup she makes to console her mother during a financial crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reveals that he 's a food-loving fellow traveler . <P> The new volume opens with Reichl reviewing restaurants for New West magazine in the late 1970s . Amid the burgeoning California food scene , she witnesses the rise of celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck , the ascendance of the seminal restaurants Chez Panisse , Chinois and Michael 's , and the increasing regard for locally grown ingredients . She rises too , eventually moving to the Los Angeles Times , where she heralds America 's embrace of Asian cuisine . <P> Reichl , 53 , credits her successful reviewing career ( which later peaked at the New York Times ) to a convergence of forces . " I feel as if I was just a little bit ahead of the curve , " she says , " because in the ' 60s almost nobody I knew was interested in food . And suddenly there I was writing about the subject in New York City , in the ' 90s , when Americans were interested and knowledgeable and the city had the money to go out and eat . There I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Comfort Me with Apples recounts how that voice was nourished , intertwining Reichl 's professional coming of age with her not-unrelated emergence into full-blown womanhood . As such , it is a very adult meditation on love . The title borrows a line from the Song of Solomon that Reichl discovered in her confirmation Bible : " Comfort me with apples , for I am lovesick . " The book luxuriates in her adulterous affair with her New West boss , Colman Andrews , who once greeted Reichl at an airport not with flowers but with fraises des bois flown in from France . " He kissed me and said , ' Close your eyes and open your mouth , ' " Reichl writes . " I sniffed the air ; it smelled like a cross between violets and berries , with just a touch of citrus . My mouth closed around something very small ... the size of a little grape but with a scratchy surface . ' Do you like it ? ' he asked anxiously . I tasted spring . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
