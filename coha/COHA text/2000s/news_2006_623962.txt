<p> The right to end life <p> Editor  --  Regarding " Victory for assisted-suicide law " ( Jan. 18 ) : In upholding Oregon 's assisted suicide law , the U.S. Supreme Court reached the right result for the wrong reasons . The law should have been upheld on the grounds of an individual 's right to his own life . <p> The right to life includes and implies the right to commit suicide . To hold otherwise is to deny the right to life at its root . If we have a duty to go on living , despite our better judgment , then our life does not belong to us , and we exist by permission , not by right . <p> Individuals have a moral right to seek assistance in committing suicide . If a doctor is willing to assist , based on an objective assessment of his patient 's mental and physical state , the law should not stand in his way . <p> There is no rational basis upon which the government can properly prevent an individual from choosing to end his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Religious conservatives , supported by the Bush administration , want to ban assisted suicide because it defies God 's will . Such conservatives crave to inject religion into the bloodstream of American law , thereby assisting in our own national suicide . People of reason must refuse their consent to the religious conservative agenda . <p> THOMAS A. BOWDEN <p> Ayn Rand Institute <p> Irvine <p> Editor  --  I do not believe that the Founding Fathers foresaw the regulation of medical practice or opiod narcotics , which were both left to the vagaries of the market and individual choice in the 18th century . <p> As admirers of ancient Rome , they were familiar with the classical attitudes that approved of suicide as an honorable exit from a life that had become unbearable for any number of reasons . I do not pretend to know what they would think of Oregon 's assisted-suicide law . <p> I am , however , almost certain that they would have felt that any regulation of medicine , wise or unwise , was a matter best left to the states , their legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original intent , " Justice Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and John Roberts now argue that they , as appointed judges , and the appointed attorney general have special insight into the accepted practice of medicine and reasonable standards of medical care . Can I conclude that the phrase " original intent " really means nothing ? <p> CHRIS MARTIN <p> Alameda <p> Violent sentence <p> Editor  --  Kevin Fagan 's first-person account of the last moments of Clarence Ray Allen 's life was powerful stuff ( " Allen managed to walk to execution gurney , " Jan. 18 ) . His detailed observations made us all witnesses to  --  and accomplices in  --  the killing of this 76-year-old man . <p> I was left wondering whether prosecutor Ward Campbell and the others representing the victims would still feel so fulfilled if they had to do the killing themselves . Particularly if we did away with the pretense of humane execution  --  lethal injection  --  and used violence to punish violence , and did so in the public square . <p> Who among them would be willing to stand before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair ? Pull the lever on the gallows ? Put a bullet into Allen 's head or slit his throat ? If they think killers should be killed , why sugarcoat the act and make someone else carry out the sentence ? <p> It is easy to endorse the death penalty when the methods are sanitized , the executions are conducted out of sight and someone else is doing the dirty work . <p> ROBERT J. INLOW <p> Charlottesville , Va . <p> The last man Editor  --  Does he know ? Will he tell us before he dies ? He may be the only person on the planet who could tell us the truth . <p> Gerald Ford , now 92 and hospitalized with pneumonia , is the last surviving member of the Warren Commission . <p> GUSTAV NELSON <p> Pleasant Hill <p> IPods on the brain <p> Editor  --  Life 's necessities include water , food , rest and shelter . Currently , we must include music . The iPod is used worldwide , at school , in the car , during meals and even during sleep . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should have to work a $7.50 wage for 53.2 hours so they can spend the entire paycheck to buy the iPod ? It 's a small price to pay in order to own a device that puts your stereo , Discman , Walkman and radio to shame . The iPod holds up to 10,000 songs , whereas your Discman can only hold 20 songs at a time . Although the Discman has the capability of holding an infinite amount of songs , who wants to go through the hassle of loading a CD ? The next two weeks ' paychecks should be spent buying accessories : headphones , chargers , portable speakers , protective case , remote control , USB hook-up , camera connector , USB power adapter , dock and all necessary software , for approximately $500 . IPods should be listened to while in the classroom , church , at your job , underwater , or anywhere there may be silence . <p> Doctors should implant an iPod into our skulls at birth . This ensures that humans will always have music right in their brains wherever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's time to consider impeachment <p> Editor  --  The Senate should defer a vote on whether Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr . should be confirmed to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Supreme Court until full hearings and an investigation by an independent counsel and Congress can be completed regarding President Bush 's admitted illegal domestic surveillance of the American people in violation of the Constitution . <p> In fact , all work in Congress should be deferred until this very basic question can be answered . Given the numerous instances of misconduct and failures on the part of this administration , from failing to prevent Sept. 11 , to misleading the country into war , to blowing the cover of an American spy , to spying on the American people , it is high time serious consideration be given to the idea of impeaching the whole administration . <p> Bush makes Nixon and Clinton look like Madison and Jefferson . <p> SAOR STETLER <p> Mill Valley <p> Editor  --  Charles Sykes ' witty letter ( " Wiretapping caveat , " Jan. 18 ) misses the point , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiretap is not in itself a bad thing . What is bad is that wire is being tapped without judicial oversight and warrants , and is therefore illegal . <p> If a terror case based on or involving these warrantless taps were brought before a court , there is a chance that it could be thrown out and a terrorist could walk free , due to illegally obtained evidence . <p> The law is the law and it must be obeyed , especially by our nation 's highest office . Listen when warranted , but make sure you have a warrant to listen . <p> PETER ELLENBY <p> San Francisco <p> Whale 's gratitude Editor  --  The heartwarming account of a humpback whale rescued by divers from entanglement in crab-trap ropes hints at the emotional depth and awareness of these long-lived mammals ( " Daring rescue of whale off Farallones , " Dec 14 ) . <p> Everything about the whale 's behavior  --  her calm demeanor while divers wielded knives , and her swimming up to and nuzzling each diver following release  --  suggests awareness that the humans were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too surprised to witness this sort of behavior in nonhumans . Cooperation and fair play are widespread in the animal kingdom , and expressions of gratitude across species boundaries have been documented in at least some primates . As science becomes more open to the emotional experiences of other animals , we can expect to see more examples of behavior once thought to be found only in humans . <p> JONATHAN BALCOMBE <p> Physicians Committee <p> for Responsible Medicine <p> Washington <p> Goose la Oakland Editor  --  Oaklanders , here 's relief from economic shortfalls . <p> The noble Canada goose , scourge of Lake Merritt , represents an abundant natural resource crying out for a daring entrepreneur . Through the husbandry and marketing of Canada geese to our local restaurant trade , a smart businessperson could turn a handsome profit while simultaneously solving our disastrous goose overpopulation problem . <p> Think of the economic benefits for the city as tourists flock to Oakland to sample our renowned haute cuisine . <p> GILLIAN GARRO <p> Oakland <p> PRO <p> When in China / " Should technology companies that do business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese government wants censored ? Why or why not ? " <p> Editor  --  Yes , of course they should comply with local laws . What would be the alternative ? It would hardly be viable for a company to try to do business in China and at the same time be selective about what Chinese laws the company wished to comply with . After all , how accepting would the United States be if a Chinese company came to the United States and wanted to pick and choose about complying with our labor laws ? If a U.S. company finds the environment in China unacceptable , then they may choose their principles over their desire to make money and stay out of the Chinese market . <p> If it were my company , I 'd evaluate how I could provide the most benefit to the Chinese people . Would it be more useful for the Chinese people to have my company 's services even though censored , than not to have the services at all ? I 'm quite sure these are the two choices and that the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market if it were breaking Chinese laws . <p> This question suggests that the United States knows better than other countries , and because of this , American citizens and companies should be allowed to break local laws with impunity . It seems we already have a lot of experience of how poorly this approach has worked . <p> KAREN GERBOSI <p> Corte Madera <p> Editor 's note : Karen Gerbosi and Carl Stritter are in the Two Cents pool . <p> CON <p> When in China / " Should technology companies that do business in China follow Chinese law and shut down Internet sites the Chinese government wants censored ? Why or why not ? " <p> Editor  --  Of course not . First the Internet 's value to us all is the untrammeled pursuit of unlimited free speech . For the first time in history , we have a global public forum where all ideas  --  good , bad or ugly  --  can see the light of day with no interference from any authority . <p> Ideas , in themselves , are neutral ; it is the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese government thinks that ideas need to be censored , then the Chinese government knows that it is failing in its only legitimate function , which is the greater good of the Chinese people . <p> How bad must it be , if the government is afraid of the musings of a simple blog ? Censorship is simply fear , fear that words alone can destroy the power and privilege of the ruling class . Human progress and enlightenment has always been through having new ideas . Censorship of ideas does not change minds ; only by exposure to debate can minds be changed . <p> If corporations are to profit in China in the long run , they need China to be a place where all transactions and contracts are open and exposed for all to see . In a country where ideas can be censored , what guarantee is there that contracts will be honored ? How ironic is it that a tech company is abetting the censorship of a blog that is exposing the corruption of the very government with which they have a contract ? <p> CARL @ @ @ @
