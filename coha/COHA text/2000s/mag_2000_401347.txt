Scientists dive deep to learn how the sea circulates <p> Walter Munk is n't afraid to make waves . Thirty years ago , the oceanographer challenged his colleagues to solve a dark mystery : What drives ocean circulation ? Today , he 's offering them a brilliant answer : The moon . <p> Despite their peacefulness on postcards , oceans are in constant motion . Winds , for instance , whip surface waters into major currents . What 's more , the North Atlantic Ocean is like a wet conveyor belt , with cold water constantly sinking in the polar regions and then traveling , deep in the ocean , back toward the tropics . Somewhere en route , scientists say , this colder , deep water must mix with warmer surface waters otherwise , almost all the ocean would become cold and Earth 's climate would be strikingly different . What watery spoon stirs the deep sea and how ? <p> In a classic 1966 paper , Munk launched a continuing effort to quantify ocean mixing . At Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of magnitude too high , but his ideas influenced a generation of researchers who 've gone searching for more precise descriptions of the power behind ocean circulation . <p> It has n't been easy . The deep sea makes an inconvenient workbench ; it 's tricky to track water circling the globe so far down . Some researchers simply assume that ocean layers sort themselves out according to differences in their temperature and density . With few actual measurements at their fingertips , however , researchers have been forced to crunch equations and , basically , guess at what drives the deep . <p> That may now be starting to change . Armed with evolving models , finer satellite images , and a better understanding of the topsy-turvy seas , scientists are finding some surprises in the seascape . <p> Two years ago , Munk and oceanographer Carl Wunsch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argued that the moon 's orbital energy must cause far-reaching ocean tides that mix the open ocean 's warm and cold layers . Perhaps , the scientists suggested , this moony mix-up helps drive ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The moon 's relevance to ocean circulation was generally considered a lunatic suggestion , " jokes Munk . <p> Scientists agree that the orbiting moon dumps energy into the world 's oceans , causing the telltale ocean tides that make beachgoers inch backward as the day progresses . Most researchers , however , assume that these tides only stir shallow seas . For instance , tidal waves constantly crash against the continental shelf , losing energy and rolling back out to sea . <p> By contrast , the deep sea has always appeared calmer , with little tidal turbulence to mix the water . Still , Munk and Wunsch reasoned that up to a fourth of the ocean 's tidal energy might be swallowed by the deep sea , jumbling the ocean 's warm and cold layers . " We 've been waiting for somebody to show us completely wrong , " Wunsch says . <p> Instead , a new study hints that they may be right . In the June 15 Nature , Gary D. Egbert of Oregon State University in Corvallis and Richard D. Ray at NASA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about one terawatt ( 1012 watts ) or 25 to 30 percent of the total tidal energy deposited into the ocean is released into the deep sea . <p> To make that estimate , Egbert and Ray used sea-surface data from a U.S.-French satellite called TOPEX/Poseidon . The satellite measures the height of daily tides by bouncing radar beams off the ocean surface . With 7 years of TOPEX/Poseidon data in hand , Egbert says , the scientists could map tidal currents , looking to see where they scattered into underwater tides , presumably mixing deep water . <p> The maps suggest that open-ocean tides are spilling much energy not all over but in hot spots , where tidal currents smash into undersea mountains and midocean ridges that jut from the seafloor . Normally , Egbert says , the stratified layers of ocean water warm and light above , cold and heavy below travel the oceans separately . When tides in the open ocean crash into an undersea mountain , however , some of the cold , deep water lurches into the upper ocean . The chilled water then mixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Repeated over and over in localized spots , Egbert says , this mixing might be enough to lighten and warm all that cold , deep water flowing along the Atlantic 's conveyor belt from the poles back toward the equator . " The spatial pattern is completely consistent with the idea that lots of energy is going into internal waves over rough topography in the ocean , " says Egbert . " These tides are losing the right amount of energy , in the right places , to be available for ocean mixing . " <p> Munk , for one , is convinced . " The new work strongly suggests two-thirds of tidal energy gets dissipated in the shallow seas but that about one-third is going into deep-ocean mixing , " he says . <p> Some of the mixing in the deep sea is controlled by wind , Munk adds but a good half of it is driven by the moon 's motion . " I 'd like to think we 've won our battle to make the moon respectable , " he says . Wunsch agrees with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we suggest . " <p> But the implication for ocean circulation needs to be confirmed , cautions James C. McWilliams at the University of California , Los Angeles . Even though tidal dissipation in deep water is plausible , he says , it 's less clear that these rolling tides really drive circulation . <p> " Mixing induces circulation only when it occurs in the presence of strong current shears or density gradients , " McWilliams says . " If the mixing occurs in weakly stratified , slowly moving water the usual situation in the abyss then it may accomplish dissipation without inducing much circulation . " <p> The deep sea is n't just a workshop for oceanographers it 's also one of Earth 's major tools for climate control . Along with the atmosphere , oceans even out the climate , shuttling heat between the equator and the poles . Without this circulation , temperatures would skyrocket in the tropics and plummet at higher latitudes like Europe . Some researchers worry that global warming will throw this circulation off , changing local climates or even shut it down entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finding clues to deep-sea circulation , says MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel , will help scientists understand and model climate change far better . <p> Emanuel may have an important clue of his own : tropical cyclones . These storms which can become hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and typhoons in the Pacific violently mix the ocean when they strike , thrashing the water column down to about 150 meters . When the storms pass , they leave behind a sprawling stretch of surface water that 's been mixed with cold , deep water from below . This cold wake typically extends a few hundred kilometers across . When Hurricane Hilda raged through the Gulf of Mexico in 1964 , for instance , surface waters over which the storm had passed dropped by as much as 6degreesC . <p> Alone , a single tropical cyclone would do just temporary damage to the sea 's swirl . But in an upcoming study , Emanuel argues that the 80 or more storms that hit worldwide each year begin to add up . " The issue is , what happens to all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the surface waters that are left cold in each wake gradually warm in the sun , so the ocean ends up with more heat than it had before the storm . Transported by the oceans ' natural conveyor belt , this newly warmed water flows north or south , out of the tropics and toward the poles , where it will grow cold , sink , and start the journey back . <p> To estimate the importance of tropical cyclones to ocean circulation , Emanuel turned to data gathered during and after 67 such storms in 1996 . A few of the storms were well documented , including measures of the cold wake that followed . Using those cyclones , Emanuel crafted a coupled atmosphere-ocean model to estimate the net ocean heating generated by all 67 storms . He concludes that the storms may have induced up to 1.4 pedawatts ( 1015 watts ) close to half the amount of heat energy transported on the ocean conveyor belt toward polar regions in any given year . " It 's quite conceivable that tropical cyclones account for a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I expect this will be quite controversial , since it 's so far from what everyone else is thinking . " <p> There 's one big problem with the cyclone-circulation idea , says J. Robert Toggweiler at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton , N.J. Tropical cyclones shake up the upper ocean , he notes , while it 's the deeper water below 1,000 m that 's central to ocean circulation . <p> While Emanuel acknowledges this limit , he adds that during field work on hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico , research teams have documented waves as far as 530 m below the sea surface . The scientists collect data from current-measuring sensors attached at various depths to steel cables running down into the ocean from buoys . A compilation of measurements at several ocean depths suggests that tropical cyclones set off waves reaching deep into the sea , Emanuel says . <p> " If it could be demonstrated that this is going on , " Toggweiler responds , " then , he 's got something . " <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep sea circulate . According to his own ocean models , he says , cold water could sink because of its own weight in the North Atlantic and settle comfortably in the deep sea . Then , it would drift into the Drake Passage , a 1,000-km-wide waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula . There , the cold water could be drawn by strong winds to the sea surface , where it would warm in the sun before floating on to high latitudes in the North Atlantic , only to grow cold and repeat the cycle . <p> " The chief advantage of this idea is its simplicity , " says Toggweiler . " It can explain all the main features of deep-sea circulation in a way that is independent of interior mixing . " <p> Other scientists agree that ocean mixing remains a poorly understood piece of the circulation puzzle . " The hot spot hypothesis was born of desperation , since scientists have n't found any kind of uniform mixing to explain deep-sea circulation , " remarks oceanographer Robert Pinkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea holds up , Pinkel and his colleagues at Scripps and four other institutions have designed HOME  --  the Hawaiian Oceanic Mixing Experiment . Beginning this year , the scientists will study the ocean tide as it propagates across the Hawaiian Ridge , a 2,000-km volcanic mountain chain that stretches from the Big Island of Hawaii to Midway Island . They 'll try to map the internal waves that emerge and measure the mixing that happens when these waves break . <p> Pinkel already knows that the ridge can spur serious tidal waves . Internal tides 100 m in amplitude have been reported just a few kilometers off Hawaii 's Waikiki Beach . " Now , we 're trying to determine if these waves break locally , mixing the ocean , or whether the energy just propagates away into the deep sea , " he says . " We also need to find the spots where the surface tide is losing energy and identify the key aspects of the topography that make it happen . " <p> Once researchers understand the physics of ocean mixing at the Hawaiian Ridge , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening near other undersea mountains worldwide . <p> No matter how deep-sea circulation plays out , Wunsch says , studies like these are giving scientists a whole new take on the seascape . " People once thought of the ocean as unchanging and steady , " he says . " We now know the ocean changes , violently , from day to day . We know that tides and winds may change what 's happening near the seafloor , that maybe hurricanes are important , that maybe there are hot spots of mixing . Ocean circulation is a lot more complex and more interesting than we ever thought .

If this ocean mixing reaches deep and happens frequently enough , scientists say , it could help explain how deep seawater endlessly cruises the globe . <p> MAP : Based on TOPEX/Poseidon satellite data , a color map estimates tidal energy dissipation in the ocean between 66degreesS and 66degrees N.
