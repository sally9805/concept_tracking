Prologue She hurries from the house , wearing a coat too heavy for the weather . It is 1941 . Another war has begun . She has left a note for Leonard , and another for Vanessa . She walks purposefully toward the river , certain of what she 'll do , but even now she is almost distracted by the sight of the downs , the church , and a scattering of sheep , incandescent , tinged with a faint hint of sulfur , grazing under a darkening sky . She pauses , watching the sheep and the sky , then walks on . The voices murmur behind her ; bombers drone in the sky , though she looks for the planes and ca n't see them . She walks past one of the farm workers ( is his name John ? ) , a robust , small-headed man wearing a potato-colored vest , cleaning the ditch that runs through the osier bed . He looks up at her , nods , looks down again into the brown water . As she passes him on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how fortunate , to be cleaning a ditch in an osier bed . She herself has failed . She is not a writer at all , really ; she is merely a gifted eccentric . Patches of sky shine in puddles left over from last night 's rain . Her shoes sink slightly into the soft earth . She has failed , and now the voices are back , muttering indistinctly just beyond the range of her vision , behind her , here , no , turn and they 've gone somewhere else . The voices are back and the headache is approaching as surely as rain , the headache that will crush whatever is she and replace her with itself . The headache is approaching and it seems ( is she or is she not conjuring them herself ? ) that the bombers have appeared again in the sky . She reaches the embankment , climbs over and down again to the river . There 's a fisherman upriver , far away , he wo n't notice her , will he ? She begins searching for a stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a recipe that must be obeyed scrupulously if it 's to succeed at all . She selects one roughly the size and shape of a pig 's skull . Even as she lifts it and forces it into one of the pockets of her coat ( the fur collar tickles her neck ) , she ca n't help noticing the stone 's cold chalkiness and its color , a milky brown with spots of green . She stands close to the edge of the river , which laps against the bank , filling the small irregularities in the mud with clear water that might be a different substance altogether from the yellow-brown , dappled stuff , solid-looking as a road , that extends so steadily from bank to bank . She steps forward . She does not remove her shoes . The water is cold , but not unbearably so . She pauses , standing in cold water up to her knees . She thinks of Leonard . She thinks of his hands and his beard , the deep lines around his mouth . She thinks of Vanessa , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have all failed , have n't they ? She is suddenly , immensely sorry for them . She imagines turning around , taking the stone out of her pocket , going back to the house . She could probably return in time to destroy the notes . She could live on ; she could perform that final kindness . Standing knee-deep in the moving water , she decides against it . The voices are here , the headache is coming , and if she restores herself to the care of Leonard and Vanessa they wo n't let her go again , will they ? She decides to insist that they let her go . She wades awkwardly ( the bottom is mucky ) out until she is up to her waist . She glances upriver at the fisherman , who is wearing a red jacket and who does not see her . The yellow surface of the river ( more yellow than brown when seen this close ) murkily reflects the sky . Here , then , is the last moment of true perception , a man fishing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Almost involuntarily ( it feels involuntary , to her ) she steps or stumbles forward , and the stone pulls her in . For a moment , still , it seems like nothing ; it seems like another failure ; just chill water she can easily swim back out of ; but then the current wraps itself around her and takes her with such sudden , muscular force it feels as if a strong man has risen from the bottom , grabbed her legs and held them to his chest . It feels personal . More than an hour later , her husband returns from the garden . " Madame went out , " the maid says , plumping a shabby pillow that releases a miniature storm of down . " She said she 'd be back soon . " Leonard goes upstairs to the sitting room to listen to the news . He finds a blue envelope , addressed to him , on the table . Inside is a letter . Dearest , I feel certain that I am going mad again : I feel we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shant recover this time . I begin to hear voices , and cant concentrate . So I am doing what seems the best thing to do . You have given me the greatest possible happiness . You have been in every way all that anyone could be . I do nt think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came . I cant fight it any longer , I know that I am spoiling your life , that without me you could work . And you will I know . You see I cant even write this properly . I cant read . What I want to say is that I owe all the happiness of my life to you . You have been entirely patient with me &; incredibly good . I want to say that -- everybody knows it . If anybody could have saved me it would have been you . Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness . I cant go on spoiling your life any longer . I do nt think two people could have been happier than we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says to the maid , " I think something has happened to Mrs. Woolf . I think she may have tried to kill herself . Which way did she go ? Did you see her leave the house ? " The maid , panicked , begins to cry . Leonard rushes out and goes to the river , past the church and the sheep , past the osier bed . At the riverbank he finds no one but a man in a red jacket , fishing . She is borne quickly along by the current . She appears to be flying , a fantastic figure , arms outstretched , hair streaming , the tail of the fur coat billowing behind . She floats , heavily , through shafts of brown , granular light . She does not travel far . Her feet ( the shoes are gone ) strike the bottom occasionally , and when they do they summon up a sluggish cloud of muck , filled with the black silhouettes of leaf skeletons , that stands all but stationary in the water after she has passed along out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and the fur of her coat , and for a while her eyes are blindfolded by a thick swatch of weed , which finally loosens itself and floats , twisting and untwisting and twisting again . She comes to rest , eventually , against one of the pilings of the bridge at Southease . The current presses her , worries her , but she is firmly positioned at the base of the squat , square column , with her back to the river and her face against the stone . She curls there with one arm folded against her chest and the other afloat over the rise of her hip . Some distance above her is the bright , rippled surface . The sky reflects unsteadily there , white and heavy with clouds , traversed by the black cutout shapes of rooks . Cars and trucks rumble over the bridge . A small boy , no older than three , crossing the bridge with his mother , stops at the rail , crouches , and pushes the stick he 's been carrying between the slats of the railing so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along but he insists on staying awhile , watching the stick as the current takes it . Here they are , on a day early in the Second World War : the boy and his mother on the bridge , the stick floating over the water 's surface , and Virginia 's body at the river 's bottom , as if she is dreaming of the surface , the stick , the boy and his mother , the sky and the rooks . An olive-drab truck rolls across the bridge , loaded with soldiers in uniform , who wave to the boy who has just thrown the stick . He waves back . He demands that his mother pick him up so he can see the soldiers better ; so he will be more visible to them . All this enters the bridge , resounds through its wood and stone , and enters Virginia 's body . Her face , pressed sideways to the piling , absorbs it all : the truck and the soldiers , the mother and the child .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
