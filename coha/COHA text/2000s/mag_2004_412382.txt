CAN SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING MAKE A GREAT LEAP FORWARD ? Photograph Photograph // The basic premise of socially responsible investing is simple : If money makes the world go " round , greener , more humane investments can improve the way it spins . Want sustainably managed forests ? Provide loans or capital to eco-minded timber companies . Want Monsanto to get out of the genetic engineering business ? Buy Monsanto stock and put forward a shareholder resolution demanding the company cease and desist . This is n't just wishful thinking ; social investors can point to many positive efforts like these . And their strength is building . Yet before hailing a new era of green capitalism , it 's also important to understand some of its limitations . Socially responsible investing ( SRI ) is something of a curious hybrid . Part capitalist outlet , part activist tool working within constraints that are mostly oblivious to anything nonfinancial , it is often misunderstood , even by those who support it . Its not-quite-fish , not-quite-fowl status leaves some wanting it to do more and others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , each view prevents social investing from fulfilling its potential . THE THREE-LEGGED STOOL Traditionally , socially responsible investing has been described as a three-legged stool made of stock screening ( avoiding the stock of bad-actor companies ) , shareholder activism ( exercising your rights as a stockholder to make positive changes ) , and community investing ( banking with institutions that loan money to worthwhile projects ) . Presumably , this stool is built to realign and hold an enlightened economy . It 's an appealing metaphor , but a bit misleading . // For starters , an image of a stool suggests that each leg is of equal strength and that they all work together in some coordinated way . In fact , some legs are considerably more developed than others and each strategy works independently of the others . There can even be some tension between SRI tactics ( but not the goals of its practitioners , who sometimes work on all three fronts ) . For example , stock screening requires avoiding or divesting yourself of companies you do n't like , while shareholder activism demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Another problem with the stool analogy is it implies that the three SRI pillars are strong enough to support a sustainable , truly healthy economy . Alas , this does n't seem possible . That will require deeper , more fundamental changes and legislative action . So is there a better analogy than a stool ? We think so , but before offering an alternative metaphor and some ideas about how SRI might become even more effective , let 's look more carefully at the three main tools available to social investors . PORTFOLIO SCREENING Although ethical investing can be traced back to 17th century Quakers who refused to invest in businesses selling armaments , the modern SRI movement was launched in 1971 with the Pax World Fund , essentially as a vehicle for stock screening . Started by ministers protesting the Vietnam War , Pax investors felt it was wrong to own stock in companies like napalm-maker Dow Chemical . So they created a mutual fund that screened out what they considered unsavory companies-including tobacco , alcohol , gambling and weapons makers . Over time , filters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental responsibility , women 's and gay rights , racial equality and animal testing . Almost 20 percent of SRI mutual funds use some kind of environmental screening , either as one of many screens or as their most important one . The gist of screening your investments is summed up with the maxim : Invest your principal with your principles . That guideline can be applied to both stocks and bonds , and take the form of positive or negative screens . Intuitively , screening seems like the best way for an investor to express disapproval or support for a public company . If , for instance , you 're angry g with Procter &; Gamble for testing its products on animals , you 'd either avoid their stock or , if you already owned it , sell it . For a positive screen , you might consider adding Ballard Power Systems to your portfolio if you look forward to the days when automobiles are powered by fuel cells . It 's easy to see why this approach appeals to investors with a conscience . And indeed , stock screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question that has long dogged ethical investors is : Do stock filters hurt returns ? In 1984 , when socially conscious investing was taking shape as an industry , Social Investment Forum ( SIF ) in Washington , D.C. did its first inventory of the movement . The grand total of money managed with a social conscience came to $40 billion . While that 's a substantial chunk of change , compared to the whole universe of invested funds it was still a boutique market . Back then , social investing pioneers struggled to be taken seriously . Mainstream media stories on SRI often ran with headlines such as , " Good Intentions , Bad Results " or " It 's Not Easy Being Green . " Although , few came right out and said it , the implication was that socially concerned investors were good-hearted saps , destined for sub-par returns . It 's been a while since social investors have had to endure such teasing ( though old myths die hard : in july 2003 , the New York Times ran an article by investing newsletter watchdog Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening for social factors hurts performance ) . Extensive research and history shows that investing according to social screens does n't harm returns and may even improve them . These findings have been clearly borne out by the success of the Domini Social Index ( DSI ) , which is a screened , slightly trimmed-down cousin of the S &P; 500 ( a roster of 500 large companies that represents the stock market as a whole ) . For the 10 years through july 31 , 2003 , the DSI gave 11.17 percent annual returns , besting the S &P; 500 's 10.29 percent . Photograph Does divesting portfolios of tobacco stocks hurt tobacco companies ? Not really . But it remains an excellent statement of an investor 's values . // In the U.S. , there are now 200 individual mutual funds ( grouped in 35 SRI fund families ) , handling $151 billion , that incorporate social screening . And many are doing quite well , thank you . A few years ago , Jon Hale and Emily Hall of Morningstar did a study of SRI funds with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent earned the coveted Morningstar five-star rating . That 's twice the rate of the overall fund universe , the researchers said . During the period of the study , 40 percent of SRI funds earned a four- or five-star rating from Morningstar , compared with 33 percent of all funds . So the idea that you lose money through SRI is simply wrong . The truth is , these funds have generally done better than average . That message has gotten around , making SRI the fastest-growing sector of the financial services industry . From that $40 billion first surveyed in 1984 , socially oriented portfolios had climbed to $2.1 trillion by the end of 2002-a more than 5,000 percent increase . You do n't need a degree in economics to be impressed by $2.1 trillion , but for those made numb by such large figures , consider that it 's roughly the combined 2000 gross domestic products ( GDP ) of Canada , Mexico and Italy . And it means that roughly one out of every nine dollars that are professionally managed are invested with some kind of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( avoiding irresponsible corporate players ) ; less do positive screeningseeking out good-guy companies . For eco-minded investors , there are a half-dozen funds ( see sidebar ) that emphasize or focus on environmental issues . For example , Portfolio 21 , run by Progressive Investment of Portland , Oregon , seeks out sustainable corporations worldwide ( such as Electrokix of Sweden , which has made environmental sustainability central to its business strategy ) . As co-founder Garsten Henningsen says , " The goal of Portfolio 21 is to identify those companies that recognize the deepening ecological crisis and are positioning themselves to benefit from a new approach to business . " What screening does is align your portfolio with your values . While this makes instinctive sense and can strengthen your convictions , there is a common misunderstanding about its ability to directly bring about social change . It 's an easy mistake to make ; after all , the unifying motto for the green money movement has been " vote with your dollars . " As a general rule , this is a good slogan to remember when spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking your clothes to a nontoxic dry cleaner , or purchasing a gas-electric hybrid car not only reduces your own ecological footprint , it directly supports important new industries . Conversely , boycotting Citibank ( and writing the company about it ) until it stops underwriting environmentally destructive construction projects is an effective method of protest . But simply boycotting Citibank 's stock or even selling your shares does n't have the same effect . Here 's why : in most cases , putting money in the stock market is n't investing in the truest sense of the word , but actually speculating . Buying shares in Ford , for example , does n't mean Ford gets the money and uses it to fund operations . It 's more like you 're buying a 1998 Taurus ; the money goes to the previous owner of the car , not Ford itself . The only time companies get your money is when they issue new stock-which they do through initial or secondary public offerings . But among the Dow Jones Industrials , only a handful of corporations have sold any new stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market activity is purely speculative . DO THEY CARE ? So the question is , does social screening-that is , refusing to buy the stock of certain companies-really make any difference to those companies ? Basically , no . If a large number of Monsanto shareholders , outraged over the company 's genetically modified products , dumped all their shares at the same time , the stock would drop-but only briefly . As soon as other investors realized nothing had changed about the corporation 's financial condition , they would scoop Monsanto 's shares right back up . Meir Statman , chair of Santa Clara University 's finance department , who has studied the effect socially responsible investors have on stock prices , explains that this is because what registers in the stock market are earnings and prospects for future earnings ; the market is blind to social concerns ( except as they affect earnings ; for example , in the form of a lawsuit or lost sales ) . Consider what would happen , for instance , if nearly all investors boycotted Wal-Mart 's stock because the company sells products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , hypothetically , the stock dropped so much you could buy the whole company for $1 million or , since this is theoretical , for $10,000 . As long as Wal-Mart 's sales stayed strong , whoever bought it could take the company private and get the financial bargain of the century . Such investors would actually be rewarded for ignoring social concerns . Of course , Wal-Mart 's stock would never even approach such amazing prices since bargain hunters would have long before stepped in and gobbled up shares . In other words , the stock market is driven by financial concerns and if an issue does n't register financially in some way , stock prices wo n't be noticeably effected . Photograph Wal-Mart 's shareholder meeting last year in Arkansas attracted 15,000 people , some of whom were there trying to influence the retail kingpin " s policies . // Statman 's theory is borne out by the performance of tobacco stocks . Did tobacco divestment actually contribute to their declines ? " Probably a little , but not a lot , " says Doug Cogan , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center ( IRRC ) , an institutional investor information service in Washington , D.C. he estimates that at most two to five percent of tobacco shares have been sold through divestment . But to actually affect prices , he says you 'd need divestment of 60 to 70 percent of shares . Research seems to indicate that , if anything , Cogan 's estimate was generous . A 1998 Social Investment Forum study on South African divestment-written by Slew Hong Tech , Ivo Welch and C. Paul Wazzan-showed that when 16 large pension funds in 1985 announced divestment from U.S. firms with large South African operations , there was no measurable negative impact on stock prices . If the goal is to hurt stock prices , " divestment is not the best tool , " the researchers wrote . The bright news in this , SIF pointed out , is that it means socially concerned investors are n't penalized financially . True enough . Still , it makes one wonder what 's the point ? Essentially , as already noted , the reason is to be aligned with your principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral consistency-nor should we underestimate its real-world power . It 's a strength that fueled Gandhi 's success against the British , Nelson Mandela 's against apartheid , and Mother Teresa 's ability to create an institution and inspiration with global reach . Applied in a more practical way , it allows us to make activist efforts without conflicts of interest . If , for example , much of your net worth were invested in McDonald 's , you 'd be unlikely to protest a new store opening in your neighborhood or be as eager for the company to use unbleached paper if it impacted earnings . The paper written by Tech , et . al . concluded that , while divestment did n't hurt stock prices , it did help " raise public moral standards and awareness of the repression of the apartheid regime . " Call it public pressure , call it the buzz factor at work-but do n't minimize it . Since it works in a big picture kind of way , the impact of screening is hard to measure . " What social investors do is bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alisa Gravitz , executive director of Coop America and vice president of SIR One way SRI does this is by demonstrating that socially oriented companies are well-managed firms that can get excellent returns . Stock screening also adds to a more civilized business climate by creating watchdogs that monitor corporate behavior . " The whole process of screening creates a need for social and environmental information on companies , " says Simon BiIlenness of Trillium Asset Management in Boston . he notes that it helped create organizations such as KLD Research &; Analytics , the social research firm in Boston that developed the Domini 400 Index , and the Investor Responsibility Research Center ( IRRC ) as information providers . " It helps set the tone , " Billenness says . " Just to have investors continually ask questions of companies on social activities can have a real impact . " KLD , SIR IRRC , the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies ( CERES ) are just a few of the institutions that have sprung from the demand for social screening . And those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph It may be surprising to some that a minority of stocks held hy green mutual funds are in environmental businesses such as solar or wind energy . // SRI has also provided an immeasurable service from the attention it has created in the culture at large . One of the great successes of SRI has been to get people to realize that ethical and environmental issues can be part of a corporation 's mission . This has paved the way for some of America 's largest organizations to adopt progressive issues . For example , pension plans at General Motors , the Cap and Hewlett-Packard ( among many others ) now offer ethical investing options for retirement plans . Hundreds of businesses have extended benefits to same-sex partners . And businesses now compete to offer the best family-friendly policies , hoping to get onto the list of Best Companies for Working Mothers , or working to win Environmental Protection Agency ( ERA ) recognition for their green practices . For many companies , it has become a regular practice to issue reports on environmental stewardship , racial equality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have added whole departments to address these concerns . " You can go to the websites of companies such as BP Amoco and Ford and see a real change in attitude , " says Tim Smith , former executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility ( ICCR ) , a coalition of religious organizations that has coordinated shareholder resolutions for 30 years . More than 70 companies , including Sunoco , General Motors , Arizona Public Service and Bank of America have accepted the CERES principles , a rigorous 10-point constitution of environmental accountability put forward by CERES-a nonprofit group formed by investors in reaction to the Exxon Valdez oil spill . Companies do n't necessarily change overnight after they sign CERES . GM , for instance , has come under fire from the group for failing to increase fuel efficiency . CERES board member Ariane Van Buren of ICCR says , " We want to see GM apply the same " can-do " spirit it used in developing new environmental technology to increasing the fuel economy of the many cars it 's putting on the road now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role , as more and more corporations grasp that social issues must in fact be integral to business itself . Recent evidence for this trend comes from the Millennium Poll released by The Conference Board in New York , based on interviews with 25,000 citizens across 23 countries . Among its major findings : two out of three people want companies to go beyond their historical focus on profits to contribute to broader societal goals as well . And further , it found that in forming their impressions of companies , people these days focus less on traditional measures like brand reputation or financial factors , and more on corporate citizenship . SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS If stock screening contributes to changing corporate behavior in an undefinable , bigger-picture way , shareholder activism offers the opportunity for what SIF 's Gravitz calls a " laser-beam focus " on particular companies . This allows investors to see clear results from their efforts . One of the best-known cases of effective shareholder activism is Rainforest Action Network and cohorts ' drive to have Home Depot commit to phasing out the sale of old-growth lumber ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable successes for the environment . They 've influenced General Electric to allot $150 to $250 million for cleaning up polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) polluting the Housatonic River in the Northeast ; they 've motivated Universal Health Services of Pennsylvania , the country 's third-largest hospital management company , to formally request that its suppliers phase out the toxic PVC in medical products ; and they have persuaded Ford , DaimlerChrysler , General Motors and Texaco to quit the Global Climate Coalition-an organization that undermined efforts to curb global warming . Photograph Shareholder activism has put pressure on Ford to build more environmentally responsible cars , but it has n't stopped the company from fulfilling its duty to the shareholders by also making millions of profitable but gas-guzzling , carbon dioxide-spewing SUVs. // Shareholder activism has been described as the muscle in SRI . Or as Peter Kinder of KLD Research &; Analytics once noted , shareholder activism works like the two-by-four whacked against an Ozark mule in old farmer jokes : it gets a corporation 's attention . Alisa Gravitz of Co-op America and SIF agrees : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get pressure from all kinds of sources , but when the investors get involved they know the issue is not going to go away . " Shareholder activism works best in conjunction with other activist efforts such as consumer boycotts and letter-writing campaigns , and it is an excellent complement to these efforts because the corporation is being " attacked " from within . Since all shareholders are part owners of the company , they have limited rights to comment on corporate policies . So even if you own only one share of Microsoft ( the equivalent ownership stake of Bill Gates ' closet door knob ) , you 're allowed to attend annual shareholder meetings , ask questions at that meeting and vote on any issues before shareholders ( which can be done via mail or the Internet ) . Up your ownership stake to $2,000 worth of stock and , if you follow the proper protocol , you can propose a non-binding corporate resolution-a shareholder referendum for a policy change . Or , as a mutual fund investor , your fund can do this for you . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds with excellent environmental criteria-worked with others to file a resolution with Hewlett-Packard , asking the company to prepare a report on the feasibility of a comprehensive product takeback policy . And after a Green Century Balanced Fund resolution , PepsiCo agreed to roll out a new lid that will save 25 million pounds of aluminum annually . As a shareholder in such proactive funds , you get a representative for these kinds of discussions with companies . One of the most significant ways ethical investors could leverage their strength is to engage in more shareholder activism . " Up until recently , the ICCR has done most of the heavy lifting themselves , " says Conrad MacKerron , " but within the last few years we have seen funds step up to the plate . " Led largely by Domini and Calvert , socially concerned mutual funds have come to recognize the importance of shareholder activism . But the industry has n't made full use of its strength . According to the Social Investment Forum 's 2003 survey , only 20 percent of SRI money is used in shareholder advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2001-though there were more resolutions filed ( from 261 in 2001 to 320 in 2003 ) and the resolutions introduced got more votes ( from 8.7 percent in 2001 to 11.4 percent in 2003 ) . It seems those practicing shareholder activism recognize its power : they 're using it more and getting better at gaining support for the issues they raise . Environmental questions and ethical employment issues were the most frequently raised proposals/resolutions . Some funds and most money managers who handle individual portfolios do n't do any shareholder activism at all . " Some of these funds are what I call " SRI Lite , ' ' " says First Affirmative Financial Network President Steve Schueth . For instance , the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund ( TIAA-CREF ) , which handles roughly $291 billion in pension funds , manages more than $5.4 billion in its Social Choice account , the country 's biggest socially screened portfolio . But Schueth adds , " TIAA-CREF only avoids the worst of the worst ; it 's not about social change . Vanguard is another one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not a fund that will do shareholder activism or community development . " Smaller funds and many money managers contend that they ca n't afford it . Domini and Calvert each have a billion or more under management and can hire a staff devoted to shareholder activism , they say . " Shareholder activism is very time-consuming and expensive , " says Kathy O'Connor , a fund manager at Towneley Capital . " I personally do n't have time to be a shareholder activist . " There are possible solutions to address the challenges a smaller SRI money management firm faces to engage in shareholder activism . Either they could pool resources and share activist coordinators , or perhaps they could contract with an independent nonprofit to do it for them . This outside agent could coordinate efforts with other social investors and nonprofit groups that use grassroots non-financial tactics . The most obvious candidates for such a coordinator would be the Social Investment Forum , As You Sow-a nonprofit that promotes progressive social and environmental policies by representing the interests of socially concerned investors , or ICCR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orchestrating coalitions of investors . Fund managers can also communicate with companies without using formal resolutions . Progressive Investment , which manages Portfolio 21 , is relatively small with $ 148 million in assets . Yet in 2002 it wrote many letters , including to AstroPower urging that it use recycled semiconductor wafers , to senators voicing opposition to garbage burning , and to the securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to encourage a round-table on environmental and social transparency . As an investor , your fees can help support this activity . You have the right to insist your mutual fund or management company be in active dialogue on your behalf . Photograph Microcredit has helped minority-owned businesses such as R24 Lumber in Ocala , Florida , which produces wall studs from discarded wood products . // Perhaps what 's needed is an independent agency that certifies money management firms are making shareholder activist efforts appropriate to their size . So while a large SRI fund might have a department devoted to activism , a small operation might just donate a percentage of its management fees or client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the SRI industry is only likely to adopt such a scenario if ethical investors create a grassroots effort to let money managers know this matters to them - and then vote with their dollars by supporting firms that are willing to move in that direction . COMMUNITY INVESTING While stock screening and shareholder activism are directed toward large corporations , community investing is about funding worthwhile projects and supporting individuals-in some ways making this the most inspiring form of SRI . Consider the story of David Royster , 40 , who lives in Chicago 's South Shore neighborhood , the once-deteriorating community where South Shore Bank is located . " When I first moved here , there were a lot of abandoned buildings , " he says . But in recent years-with the help of loans from South Shore Bank-he has almost single-handedly revitalized the 7100 block of Merrill Avenue . " There was gang activity and drugs in those buildings , " he says . " I bought the buildings and rehabbed them one by one . Now the whole block is safe and beautiful . " And along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employment for locals . As with most good news , this brings other positive residual benefits : instead of urban flight , which adds to suburban sprawl and the accompanying burden put on ecosystems , Royster has essentially recycled buildings while also reducing the need for cars . Loans on an even smaller scale than Royster 's can also have an enormous impact . In 1974 , Muhammad Yunnus , an economics professor at Chittagond University in Bangladesh , met a struggling yet talented young furniture maker . She was literally starving , because in order to buy her raw materials she needed to borrow money from a usurious money lender-who was charging the equivalent of 10 percent interest a day . Professor Yunnus lent the women a few dollars to free her from that burden . Within a few months she paid the loan back and Grameen Bank was born . Since then , Grameen has loaned out billions of dollars ( significant amounts used to finance small-scale appropriate technology that encourages self-reliance and improved efficiency , which is typically human powered ) , grown to more than 1,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borrowers do n't need collateral to get a loan , but they do need to be part of a small group that guarantees each other 's loans . The repayment rate is an impressive 97 percent . Since Grameen formed more than 25 years ago , many other like-minded microlending institutions have sprouted , including dozens in the U.S. For eco-minded investors also interested in helping those in difficult economic circumstances , Self-Help Credit Union in Durham , North Carolina offers an appealing program that creates ownership and good opportunities for minorities and low-income families who have environmentally friendly businesses . For instance , Self-Help loaned money for buying equipment to R24 Lumber company , a minority-owned business that remanufactures discarded wood into useable wall studs . Other banks with a strong or exclusive focus on loaning money to environmentally oriented businesses or nonprofits include Shorebank Pacific in Washington , Chittenden Rank 's Socially Responsible Division in Vermont , Permaculture Credit Union in New Mexico and Wainright Rank in Massachusetts . While most community investing is done through banks and credit unions , there are also loan funds and trusts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice often at the discretion of the borrower . And because risk is pooled , these tend to be safe investments . They 're akin to buying a certificate of deposit , with the added benefit of knowing your money is being put to use making the world better . Ib invest in a variety of loan funds at once , the Calvert Social Investment Foundation ( a nonprofit organization independent of Calvert Funds ) offers professionally managed notes ( debt instruments ) . One of the wonderful things about community investing is that almost anyone can participate . all you need is a checking or savings account to put your money into deserving hands . Yet , despite this relatively easy access , the biggest problem with community investing is that not enough investors do it . To quote the SIF 2003 survey again , only two-thirds of one percent-or $14 billion of the $2.1 trillion invested by socially conscious investors-is in community investing . To boost this important sector , SIF and Co-op America have developed an initiative to get one percent of SRI assets into community development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Given the success of their efforts so far , it 's likely they 'll make that goal . Between 2001 and 2003 , community-investing assets grew by an impressive 84 percent . Photograph Until its collapse , Enron was widely considered a model socially responsible business . Its stock was even held by many green mutual funds . // To help support this effort , SIF has developed a community investing logo ( a half-circle of human figures holding hands , connected to a house ) that identifies its members with at least one percent of managed assets in community investments . Consider adding this as a criterion when selecting your investments . It 's another way to use your dollars to help push the SRI community to make more of a real difference . THE NEXT STEP While it 's nice to linger over victories , with so much work to be done it seems more important to ask : how can SRI successes be repeated and multiplied ? Is there a way to consistently steer large corporations toward sustainability and more enlightened behavior ? After all , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERES principles , that leaves many thousands of public corporations which have not . So while Home Depot moves toward greater environmental awareness , Boise Cascade and Georgia Pacific continue to mow down ancient forests ( or buy from suppliers who do ) in Indonesia , British Columbia , Russia and Oregon . While environmentalists cheered when Ford abandoned the Global Climate Coalition , the company continues to make the four-ton , 19-foot-long Excursion sport utility vehicle , which spews as much global warming pollution as two average cars . And while GM has signed the CERES Principles , it still lobbies to fight tighter pollution-emission standards for cars . These issues point to problems interwoven into our financial system . Consider Enron-not as the poster child of corporate misdeeds-but to look at the atmosphere that helped create its implosion . By looking at the forces that allowed the Enron scandal to happen , we can better understand the challenges social investors or any economic tide-turners face . Before its collapse , Enron was considered a model socially responsible company , and its stock was in many SRI mutual funds when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College Carroll School of Management noted in her article " Fluff is Not Enough , " Enron rang all the bells of corporate social responsibility . It won a spot for three years on the list of the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America . In 2000 it received six environmental awards . It issued a triple bottom line report . It had great policies on climate change and human rights , and even had strong anti-corruption guidelines . Its CEO gave speeches at ethics conferences and put together a statement of values emphasizing " communication , respect and integrity . " Enron fooled us . But that 's not the real point here . The point is that all the things SRI has been measuring and screening for and applauding miss something fundamental going on inside companies-and that something is the unremitting pressure to get the numbers by any means possible . The biggest difficulty SRI faces is that it operates on an unspoken assumption that managers have genuine freedom to be socially responsible . But in many cases , they do n't . Can Ford 's CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits ? As the company 's financial caretaker , that would be a breach of his fiduciary responsibilities . From the beginning , SRI has been about separating the good guys from the bad guys . It 's operated on the belief that the white hats can be spotted by their exemplary policies and programs and sustainability reports . But the lessons of Enron tell a different story . Enron and other corporate scandals point to system-wide pressure . It 's not about good companies vs. bad companies , but about the pressures that act on all public companies . The focus in SRI has been on encouraging companies to voluntarily undertake responsible moves . But the pressure to get the numbers is not voluntary . And that pressure comes from many sources . Pressures built within the structure of companies often start from the top , with financial incentives for executives that tend to be based on increasing short-term earnings-a motivator that often works against the environment ( since the initial costs of eliminating toxics generally hurt the bottom line ) , not to mention the long-term health of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lack of vision since corporations do n't choose directorates via real elections . The result is management-selected yesmen and no employee representation ( and not even a way for them to run ) . At bottom , there 's the design of financial statements , which leaves nowhere to account for " externalities " such as environmental effects , making them invisible . Then there are pressures from state laws , which often say corporate directors must maximize the bottom line-so when it comes to choosing between spending on cleaning up the Housatonic River or fattening earnings , directors feel their legal obligation to the company financials . But most of all , it comes from an entrenched and antiquated system of taxation ; one that derives most of its revenue from taxing profits and income ( which we should be trying to encourage ) instead of negatives like pollution . If carbon emissions were taxed , for instance , businesses would quickly figure out clever ways to use less oil , gas and coal . And if companies paid Uncle Sam based , at least partly , on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ecological footprint . Capitalism can work brilliantly ; it just needs some tinkering . Addressing these sorts of issues has traditionally been beyond the scope of the SRI community-and understandably so , given such issues tend to be better suited to think tanks and grassroots social change organizations , lit , if the SRI industry hopes to truly live up to its promise , in some fashion , it needs to work on the big picture , perhaps working in conjunction with nonprofit groups that can focus on system design issues . There are even a few places where this is already happening . The Corporate Sunshine Working Group , for example , is an alliance of investors , environmental organizations , unions and public interest groups working to enforce and expand SEC corporate social and environmental disclosure requirements . The Global Reporting Initiative is a coalition of businesses , nonprofits and government agencies working to set uniform , globally applicable standards that measure environmental impact . To support such efforts , SRI money managers could allocate a small percentage of their fees or levy a tiny " tax " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonprofits that work at a structural level , such as Redefining Progress , an economic policy and advocacy group . Just as the Social Investment Forum has a campaign to encourage investors to devote at least one percent of their assets to community investing , there could be a .5 percent or at least a very modest 1 percent campaign to support organizations working on systemic change . Even a very small percentage of SRI assets devoted to improving our tax system could make a big difference and build vital momentum . If nothing else , SRI money managers and organizations could help spread the word , letting their clients know we 're facing problems larger than just where you put your money . That does n't suggest current SRI practices should be abandoned , only that they need to be expanded and put in perspective . A good place to begin a conceptual shift is by reconsidering SRI 's three-legged stool analogy . Instead of a stool , we 'd like to suggest that a more appropriate image is a three-pronged fork . At this point , not all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activism and community investing could be larger , stronger and sharper-allowing social investors to wield a tool that works more like a pitchfork than a dinner utensil . Using the imagery of a fork-shaped tool helps us remember that to get results , ethical investors must continue prodding away . It also helps keep the big issues in mind : it 's a reminder that aspects of the economy act like an untamed beast that needs poking in the right direction .
