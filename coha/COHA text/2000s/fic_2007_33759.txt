" One of the best kept secrets in the knitting world is that knitting lace appears to be much more difficult than it is . If you can knit , purl , knit two together and put the yarn over your needle to form a new stitch , you CAN knit lace . " - Myrna A.I. Stahman , Rocking Chair Press , designer , author and publisher of Stahman 's Shawls and Scarves-Lace Faroese-Shaped Shawls From The Neck Down and Seamen 's Scarves , and the soon to be published The Versatility of Lace Knitting-Variations on a Theme Lydia Goetz Ilove A Good Yarn , and I 'm grateful for every minute I spend in my shop on Blossom Street . I love looking at the skeins of yarn in all their colors and feeling the different textures . I love my knitting classes and the friends I 've made here . I love studying the pattern books . I love gazing out my front window onto the energy and activity of downtown Seattle . In fact , I love everything about this life I 've found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's something I 've said often , I know , but it 's simply the truth . Even now , after nearly ten years of living cancer-free , knitting dominates my life . Because of my yarn store , I 've become part of a community of knitters and friends . I 'm also married now , to Brad Goetz . A Good Yarn was my first real chance atlife and Brad was my first chance at love . Together , Brad and I are raising our nine-year-old son . I say Cody 's our son , and he is , in all the ways that matter . I consider him as much my child as Brad 's ; I could n't love Cody more if I 'd given birth to him . It 's true he has a mother , and I know Janice does care about him . But Brad 's ex-wife is ! well , I hesitate to say it , but selfish is the word that inevitably comes to mind . Janice appears intermittently in Cody 's life , whenever the mood strikes her or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed when she and Brad divorced . Sadly , she only sees her son once or twice a year . I can tell that the lack of communication bothers Cody . And Janice 's cavalier attitude toward motherhood angers me , but like my son , I do n't mention the hurt . Cody does n't need me to defend or malign Janice ; he 's capable of forming his own opinions . For a kid , he 's remarkably resilient and insightful . On a February morning , my store with all its warmth and color was a cozy place to be . The timer on the microwave went off ; I removed the boiling water and poured it into my teapot after dropping in a couple of tea bags . The rain was falling from brooding , gray skies as it often does in winter . I decided it was time to start another knitting class . I maintain several ongoing classes and charity knitting groups , and I usually begin a new session four or five times a year . As I considered my new class , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life in the assisted-living complex reasonably well . In some ways , I suspect that moving her was even more difficult for my sister , Margaret , and me than it was for Mom . Although Mom hated giving up her independence , she seemed relieved not to have the worry about the house and yard anymore . I wept the day the house was sold , and while she never allowed me to see her tears , I believe Margaret did , too . Selling the house meant letting go of our childhood and all the reminders of growing up there . It was the end of an era for us both , just as it was for our mother . While I drank my tea , I f lipped through the new patterns that had arrived the day before . The first one to catch my eye was a prayer shawl . Lately , I 'd seen several patterns for these shawls , some more complex than others . I could easily envision knitting this one for Mom . Prayer shawls have become popular in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth , emotional , as well as physical . I 'd received several inquiries about them and thought perhaps one of these shawls would make for an interesting class . I decided to discuss it with my sister , Margaret , who has a keen business sense and a good feel for which class I should offer next . I did n't appreciate that about her until after she 'd come to join me at the shop . Margaret worked for me part-time , which has now turned into full-time . She 's not as good with people as I am , but she knows yarn and , surprisingly , has become an excellent employee . She 's also my friend . Not so long ago , I could n't have said that ; we might be sisters , but the tension between us was unbearable at times . Our relationship changed for the better , and I thank A Good Yarn for that . Margaret would n't arrive for another thirty minutes , since the shop officially opened at ten . Any number of tasks awaited my attention , things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new yarn . Instead , I sat at my desk , with my teacup between my hands . I felt so incredibly blessed . Needless to say , I did n't always feel this tranquil . When I was in my early twenties , a second bout of cancer struck with a viciousness that had me reeling . I survived , but my father did n't . You see , he fought so hard for me , and when it seemed I 'd make it after all , he died , suddenly and unexpectedly , of a heart attack . It was almost as though my recovery meant he could leave me now . Before I lost Dad , I tended to approach my life tentatively , afraid of happiness , fearing the future . It was a void that loomed hopelessly before me and filled me with dread . Dad was the one who gave me strength . With him gone , I knew I was responsible for my own life . I had a decision to make and I boldly chose ! independence . I chose to become part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ceiling above me creaked and I knew Colette was up . Colette Blake rented the small apartment over the shop . For the first two years , that tiny apartment was my home , my very first home away from family . After I married Brad , I was n't quite sure what to do with the apartment . It stood empty for a while . Then I met Colette , and I 'd known instantly that she 'd be the perfect tenant . The apartment would console her , give her a place to regain her emotional balance . A bonus-for me-is that she looks after Whiskers on my days off . My cat is a much-loved feature in my store , which he considers his home . I 've had customers stop by just to visit him . He often sleeps in the front window , curling up in the afternoon sun . Whiskers generates lots of comments-and smiles . Pets have a way of connecting people to life 's uncomplicated joys . Colette reminds me of myself three years ago , when I first opened the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson , who owns the f lower shop next door , brought her over to meet me . It was n't cancer that shook her world , though . It was death . Colette is a thirty-one-year-old widow . Her husband , Derek , a Seattle policeman , died a little over a year ago . When I mention that , people usually assume Derek was killed in the line of duty . Not so . Following a Seattle downpour , he climbed on the roof to repair a leak . No one knows exactly how it happened but apparently Derek slipped and fell . He died two days later of massive head injuries . In the weeks since she 'd moved here , Colette had only referred to the accident once , as if even talking about her husband was difficult . I 've learned that she 's an easygoing person who laughs readily and yet at times her grief seemed palpable . Overwhelming . I understood how she felt . I remembered all too well that sense of anguish , that terror of what might happen tomorrow or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I once did . I longed to reassure her , and I hoped my friendship provided some pleasure and solace . Friends like Jacqueline and Alix had done the same for me . The apartment has an outside entrance , as well as the one leading into the store . Susannah Nelson had hired Colette soon after Susannah purchased what used to be known as Fanny 's Floral . Colette 's mother once owned a f lower shop , and Colette had worked there as a high-school student . Her house sold practically the day it was listed , and Colette needed to move quickly . My tiny apartment was vacant , so we struck a deal . I assumed she would n't be there long . Most of her belongings were in storage and she was taking the next few months to decide where she 'd live and what she 'd do . The stairs creaked as she ventured down . Since Colette became my tenant , we sometimes shared a pot of tea in the mornings . She was always respectful of my time and I enjoyed our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for a clean cup . Without asking , I filled it and held it out . " Thanks . " Colette smiled as she took the tea . She was thin-too thin , really . Her clothes were a bit loose , but with her aptitude for style she cleverly disguised it . I noticed , though , as someone who 's done the same thing . Part of what I liked about her was the fact that she was lovely without seeming consciously aware of it . Despite her occasional silences , Colette was warm and personable , and I could see she 'd be a success at whatever she chose . She had n't said much about the job she 'd left , but I gathered it was a far more demanding position than helping customers in a f lower shop . This job change obviously had something to do with her husband 's death . She told me he 'd died a year ago January fourteenth . She 'd waited for the year to pass before making major changes in her life-selling her home , moving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways and completely understandable in others . Colette wore her long , dark hair parted in the middle . It fell straight to her shoulders , where it curved under . She seemed to achieve this effect naturally-unlike some women , who spend hours taming their hair with gel and spray . In the short time she 'd been here , Colette had made a positive impression on everyone she met . Everyone except my sister . Margaret , being Margaret , shied away from Colette , instinctively distrusting her . My sister 's like that ; she tends to be a naysayer . She insisted that renting out the apartment had been a huge mistake . In Margaret 's eyes , a tenant , any tenant , was n't to be trusted . She appeared to think Colette would sneak into the shop in the middle of the night and steal every skein of yarn I owned , then hock them on the streets and use the money for drugs . I smiled whenever I thought about that , since not only did I trust Colette , I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mildly , protective of me . She 's older and tends to assume more responsibility than is warranted . It 's taken me a long time to understand my sister and even longer to appreciate her , but that 's a different story . Colette held the teacup close to her mouth and paused . " Derek would 've turned thirty-three today , " she said quietly . She stared into the distance , then looked back at me . I nodded , encouraging her to talk . She 'd only told me about Derek that one other time . I believed , based on my own experience , that the more she shared her pain , the less it would hurt . " Derek wanted children ! . We 'd been trying , but I did n't get pregnant and now ! " " I 'm sure you 'll have children one day , " I told her . I was confident that she would n't be alone for the rest of her life , that she 'd marry again and probably have children . Her smiled was filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby that morning . The next thing I knew , I was choosing his casket . Ironic , is n't it ? " I did n't know how to comfort her , so I leaned over and gave her a hug . She seemed a little embarrassed by my show of sympathy and focused her gaze on the f loor . " I should n't have said anything . I did n't mean to start your day on a sad note . Actually , it was n't until I glanced at the calendar on your desk that I realized the date . " " It 's okay , Colette . I 'm just so sorry . " " Thank you , " she said , shrugging lightly . " Life is like that sometimes , you know ? " " Yes ! " And I did . Colette set the empty cup in my sink . The back door opened , then shut with a bang . Margaret , of course , muttering about the weather . After Colette moved in , Margaret had taken to parking in the alley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goings . After dumping her huge felted purse on the table , she hesitated , stiffening at the sight of Colette . " Good morning , " I said brightly , pleased to see her despite her bad mood . " It 's a fine morning , is n't it ? " I could n't resist a touch of sarcasm . " It 's raining , " she replied , eyeing Colette almost as if she were an intruder . " Rainy weather 's good for knitting , " I reminded her . For me , there was nothing more satisfying on a rainy afternoon than working on my current knitting project with a cup of tea by my side . People looked for something productive to do when it rained and-fortunately for me-that sometimes included knitting . Margaret removed her coat and hung it on the peg by the back door . " Julia dropped me off this morning , " she said in passing . I caught the significance right away . " You let Julia drive the new car ? " Only the day before , Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been asking to take the car out for a spin . If I recall , Margaret 's exact words were Not in this lifetime .
