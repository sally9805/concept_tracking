The debate outside the ring is often as heated as the fights inside the ring Photograph In one of her first bouts , Laila Ali , the youngest daughter of former champ Muhammad Ali , punches Shadina Pennybaker during Nov. 10 , 1999 , match . The 21-year-old Ali , who trains at L.A. Boxing ( below ) , is one of many Black women entering the world of women 's boxing . // LAILA Ali trains six days a week . On those days , she runs about four miles and goes to the gym . There , she hits the speed bag , practices her footwork , and laces up her boxing gloves to pound the heavy bag and then do a few rounds of sparring . The sweat is the same . And so is the blood . Professional boxing knows no gender and does n't discriminate once you step through the ropes . Showcasing supremely conditioned , trash-talking athletes with swift punches and fancy footwork , the sport is finding new warriors in African-American women , And some of these athletes  --  from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding a measure of success in the ring . But there 's also controversy , sparked by boxing purists and spectators who believe that women should not participate in such a violent sport . And those feelings have prompted often heated debate about whether there is or whether there should be room for Black women in big-time boxing . The arguments against women 's boxing range from safety issues to social issues . Some critics say that women 's bodies are n't built for boxing while others just do n't want to see women get hit . In some countries there are laws against women 's boxing . On the other side , there is strong support for women in boxing , with many fans believing that participants should have the opportunity to win the big purse , even if they carry a purse . " I was n't too crazy about women 's boxing myself , " says New Jersey boxing promoter Diane Fischer , owner of Dee Lee Promotions . " But I went out and I watched the girls . They train just as hard as the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Photograph Wearing championship belts , ( Downtown ) Leona Brown has proven herself a winner in boxing circles . The 4-foot-11 fighter is the twotime International Female Boxing Association ( IFBA ) junior featherweight champion . // In the midst of all the fuss , Ali , who trains at L.A. Boxing in Los Angeles , is learning the ropes . Since October , she has stepped into the ring with three opponents , all with a similar lack of experience , and she won each bout by knockout . She 'd like to have the security and time anonymity would allow , but that 's impossible . She 's an Ali , and she 's a boxer . Although her name brought her instant recognition as the daughter of former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali , the 21-year-old knows she 's just getting started . The buzz about the 5-foot-10-inch , 168-pound fighter can be distracting . Some fans attend her fights to catch a glimpse of her famous father . And yes , some are waiting to see if she 'll fall on her face . Still others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 38year-old lawyer-daughter of famed boxer Joe Frazier , who was Muhammad Ali 's fiercest rival , has even challenged the younger Ali to a fight . So far , Ali 's camp has declined . " If I could , I would have loved to not have been Laila Ali . I would have loved to have been a person who is not Muhammad Ali 's daughter , and start boxing and get my experience . And then , once I feel comfortable and get experience , come out and have people watch me , " says Ali , who 's been training for about 17 months . " People started being in my face from the beginning of my career , when I did n't know anything yet , and they started trying to judge me . Really , it 's just too soon . " When it comes to shunning the spotlight , Ali is in the minority . Other Black female boxers like ( Downtown ) Leona Brown and Tiffany ( Lady Logan ) would give anything for the opportunity to turn down a televised fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can hope for at this point is local success and some acclaim in boxing 's inner circle  --  where fans follow their favorite fighters on the Internet or in boxing magazines or on the occasional televised undercard of a major fight . That 's why these women have been training  --  and waiting  --  for their shot at the big time . But even if you do have the skills , with no name or gimmick to thrust you to the head of the class , boxing insiders say its difficult to get the exposure needed for the big-money , multimillion-dollar purses prevalent in big-time men 's boxing . Women 's boxing is so young ( recognized by USA Boxing in 1993 ) , experts say that it 's difficult to know who 's going to break out of the pack and turn it into a mega-sport . The public interest is there , says Fischer , who 's had a hard time breaking into what she calls the " old boys " club . " The money , the endorsements , the credibility and fairness are not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promoter , " says Fischer . " And I 've been fighting it for three years . " Undoubtedly , women 's boxing has grown , says Rick Kulis , a boxing promoter and co-founder of the Torrance , Calif. - based International Female Boxers Association ( IFBA ) . And much of that growth has taken place over the past two years . In 1996 , about 130 women were registered as amateur boxers . Today , Kulis says , there are more than 1,200 women who are boxing for USA Boxing and Golden Gloves , the amateur proving grounds . Frank Globuschultz , president and CEO of the International Women 's Boxing Federation , based in Huntington , N.Y. , estimates that about 30 percent of the women boxers coming up today are African-American . With such explosive growth in the sport , boxing experts can only guess why sponsors and endorsers are so reluctant to embrace women boxers the way they have embraced women 's basketball and soccer players . It may be the reluctance to agree that there 's a place for women in the ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally male and the specific medical risks to female boxers are n't yet known . Then there are those who believe that if women are going to get into the ring , the same rules and regulations that apply to men should apply to women . But there are some concessions to women in the sport : Female boxers fight two-minute rounds instead of the customary three-minute rounds ; women fighters wear a chest protector and must have mandatory pregnancy tests before each fight . Meanwhile , boxing purists do n't want to see the intensity of the sport diluted by sanctioned " catfights " and brawls that involve less-than-skillful fighters . Regardless of the naysayers , female boxers today are breaking the stereotypes by engaging in much more than " cat fights " and training just as hard as the men . They want to be taken seriously .

Like many African-Americans in women 's boxing , Brown is struggling for recognition in a sport where , she says , other , less-qualified women dominate media coverage , not necessarily because of their skills , but because they fight a man or pose nude in a men 's magazine . There 's no doubt in Brown 's mind that she can make it to the bigtime ; she just has to get the right opportunity , she says , and the right money . " There 's a lot of politics in this game , " says Brown , who began boxing at age 36 . " I 'm the two-time champion . I 've got to start getting paid like the twotime champion . " Lady Logan 's story is similar . At 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing 183 pounds , she is ranked first in the light heavyweight division by the IWBF . The 31-year-old mother of two has been boxing for about three years , holds an amateur belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her goal , aside from finishing her bachelor 's degree , is to become the light heavyweight champion of the world . She hopes the sport will continue to grow , with more skillful fighters lending more credibility to the sport . " If the bouts are skillful and worthy of being put on , then yes , there 's going to be a big boom , " Logan says from her home in Columbus , Ohio . " There are thousands of women getting into this every year , now . It 's not dying out at all . " Kulis , who 's also president of Event Entertainment , says television will play a key role in giving women 's boxing the exposure that growth demands . On payper-view and on cable , some women 's bouts are being televised , but not enough for the boxers to really develop a following . " What women 's boxing needs is consistent presentation to the public on television , so fighters can develop a following and loyalty , " says Kulis , who founded the IFBA in 1997 .

" Globuschultz , whom everyone calls " Frankie G. , " agrees , saying there 's a lot of room at the top for women 's boxing . " Years ago , people would say " Why do you want to box ? There 's no future , " ' says Globuschultz , owner of New York City 's Academy of Boxing for Women . " There is a future , now , in women 's boxing , and it will be there .

But there are people out there who work hard , are good fighters and really know how to box , They are going to help the sport , but it 's going to take time . " Photograph // <p>
