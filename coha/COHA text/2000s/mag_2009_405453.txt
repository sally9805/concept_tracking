Once just a fad , Twitter is developing into a powerful form of communication . What its growth says about us -- and the future of American innovation . The one thing you can say for certain about Twitter is that it makes a terrible first impression . You hear about this new service that lets you send 140-character updates to your " followers , " and you think , Why does the world need this , exactly ? It 's not as if we were all sitting around four years ago scratching our heads and saying , " If only there were a technology that would allow me to send a message to my 50 friends , alerting them in real time about my choice of breakfast cereal . " I , too , was skeptical at first . I had met Evan Williams , Twitter 's co-creator , a couple of times in the dotcom ' 90s when he was launching Blogger.com . Back then , what people worried about was the threat that blogging posed to our attention span , with telegraphic , two-paragraph blog posts replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launching a communications platform that limited you to a couple of sentences at most . What was next ? Software that let you send a single punctuation mark to describe your mood ? And yet as millions of devotees have discovered , Twitter turns out to have unsuspected depth . In part this is because hearing about what your friends had for breakfast is actually more interesting than it sounds . The technology writer Clive Thompson calls this " ambient awareness " : by following these quick , abbreviated status reports from members of your extended social network , you get a strangely satisfying glimpse of their daily routines . We do n't think it at all moronic to start a phone call with a friend by asking how her day is going . Twitter gives you the same information without your even having to ask . The social warmth of all those stray details should n't be taken lightly . But I think there is something even more profound in what has happened to Twitter over the past two years , something that says more about the culture that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the breakfast-status updates turned out to be more interesting than we thought . But the key development with Twitter is how we 've jury-rigged the system to do things that its creators never dreamed of . In short , the most fascinating thing about Twitter is not what it 's doing to us . It 's what we 're doing to it . The Open Conversation Earlier this year I attended a daylong conference in Manhattan devoted to education reform . Called Hacking Education , it was a small , private affair : 40-odd educators , entrepreneurs , scholars , philanthropists and venture capitalists , all engaged in a sprawling six-hour conversation about the future of schools . Twenty years ago , the ideas exchanged in that conversation would have been confined to the minds of the participants . Ten years ago , a transcript might have been published weeks or months later on the Web . Five years ago , a handful of participants might have blogged about their experiences after the fact . But this event was happening in 2009 , so trailing behind the real-time , real-world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset of the conference , our hosts announced that anyone who wanted to post live commentary about the event via Twitter should include the word #hackedu in his 140 characters . In the room , a large display screen showed a running feed of tweets . Then we all started talking , and as we did , a shadow conversation unfolded on the screen : summaries of someone 's argument , the occasional joke , suggested links for further reading . At one point , a brief argument flared up between two participants in the room -- a tense back-and-forth that transpired silently on the screen as the rest of us conversed in friendly tones . At first , all these tweets came from inside the room and were created exclusively by conference participants tapping away on their laptops or BlackBerrys . But within half an hour or so , word began to seep out into the Twittersphere that an interesting conversation about the future of schools was happening at #hackedu . A few tweets appeared on the screen from strangers announcing that they were following the #hackedu thread . Then others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further exploration . A few experts grumbled publicly about how they had n't been invited to the conference . Back in the room , we pulled interesting ideas and questions from the screen and integrated them into our face-to-face conversation . When the conference wrapped up at the end of the day , there was a public record of hundreds of tweets documenting the conversation . And the conversation continued -- if you search Twitter for #hackedu , you 'll find dozens of new comments posted over the past few weeks , even though the conference happened in early March . Injecting Twitter into that conversation fundamentally changed the rules of engagement . It added a second layer of discussion and brought a wider audience into what would have been a private exchange . And it gave the event an afterlife on the Web . Yes , it was built entirely out of 140-character messages , but the sum total of those tweets added up to something truly substantive , like a suspension bridge made of pebbles . The Super-Fresh Web The basic mechanics of Twitter are remarkably simple . Users publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The character limit allows tweets to be created and circulated via the SMS platform used by most mobile phones . ) As a social network , Twitter revolves around the principle of followers . When you choose to follow another Twitter user , that user 's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page . If you follow 20 people , you 'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page : breakfast-cereal updates , interesting new links , music recommendations , even musings on the future of education . Some celebrity Twitterers -- most famously Ashton Kutcher -- have crossed the million-follower mark , effectively giving them a broadcast-size audience . The average Twitter profile seems to be somewhere in the dozens : a collage of friends , colleagues and a handful of celebrities . The mix creates a media experience quite unlike anything that has come before it , strangely intimate and at the same time celebrity-obsessed . You glance at your Twitter feed over that first cup of coffee , and in a few seconds you find out that your nephew got into med school and Shaquille O'Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past month , Twitter has added a search box that gives you a real-time view onto the chatter of just about any topic imaginable . You can see conversations people are having about a presidential debate or the American Idol finale or Tiger Woods -- or a conference in New York City on education reform . For as long as we 've had the Internet in our homes , critics have bemoaned the demise of shared national experiences , like moon landings and " Who Shot J.R . " cliff hangers -- the folkloric American living room , all of us signing off in unison with Walter Cronkite , shattered into a million isolation booths . But watch a live mass-media event with Twitter open on your laptop and you 'll see that the futurists had it wrong . We still have national events , but now when we have them , we 're actually having a genuine , public conversation with a group that extends far beyond our nuclear family and our next-door neighbors . Some of that conversation is juvenile , of course , just as it was in our living room when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is moving , witty , observant , subversive . Skeptics might wonder just how much subversion and wit is conveyable via 140-character updates . But in recent months Twitter users have begun to find a route around that limitation by employing Twitter as a pointing device instead of a communications channel : sharing links to longer articles , discussions , posts , videos -- anything that lives behind a URL . Websites that once saw their traffic dominated by Google search queries are seeing a growing number of new visitors coming from " passed links " at social networks like Twitter and Facebook . This is what the naysayers fail to understand : it 's just as easy to use Twitter to spread the word about a brilliant 10,000-word New Yorker article as it is to spread the word about your Lucky Charms habit . Put those three elements together -- social networks , live searching and link-sharing -- and you have a cocktail that poses what may amount to the most interesting alternative to Google 's near monopoly in searching . At its heart , Google 's system is built around the slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Google 's search results according to , in part , how many links point to them , which tends to favor older pages that have had time to build an audience . That 's a fantastic solution for finding high-quality needles in the immense , spam-plagued haystack that is the contemporary Web . But it 's not a particularly useful solution for finding out what people are saying right now , the in-the-moment conversation that industry pioneer John Battelle calls the " super fresh " Web . Even in its toddlerhood , Twitter is a more efficient supplier of the super-fresh Web than Google . If you 're looking for interesting articles or sites devoted to Kobe Bryant , you search Google . If you 're looking for interesting comments from your extended social network about the three-pointer Kobe just made 30 seconds ago , you go to Twitter . From Toasters to Microwaves Because Twitter 's co-founders -- Evan Williams , Biz Stone and Jack Dorsey -- are such a central-casting vision of start-up savvy ( they 're quotable and charming and have the extra glamour of using a loft in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office park in Silicon Valley ) much of the media interest in Twitter has focused on the company . Will Ev and Biz sell to Google early or play long ball ? ( They have already turned down a reported $500 million from Facebook . ) It 's an interesting question but not exactly a new plotline . Focusing on it makes you lose sight of the much more significant point about the Twitter platform : the fact that many of its core features and applications have been developed by people who are not on the Twitter payroll . This is not just a matter of people finding a new use for a tool designed to do something else . In Twitter 's case , the users have been redesigning the tool itself . The convention of grouping a topic or event by the " hashtag "  - -  #hackedu or #inauguration -- was spontaneously invented by the Twitter user base ( as was the convention of replying to another user with the @ symbol ) . The ability to search a live stream of tweets was developed by another start-up altogether , Summize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an adviser to one of the minority investors in Summize . ) Thanks to these innovations , following a live feed of tweets about an event -- political debates or Lost episodes -- has become a central part of the Twitter experience . But just 12 months ago , that mode of interaction would have been technically impossible using Twitter . It 's like inventing a toaster oven and then looking around a year later and seeing that your customers have of their own accord figured out a way to turn it into a microwave . One of the most telling facts about the Twitter platform is that the vast majority of its users interact with the service via software created by third parties . There are dozens of iPhone and BlackBerry applications -- all created by enterprising amateur coders or small start-ups -- that let you manage Twitter feeds . There are services that help you upload photos and link to them from your tweets , and programs that map other Twitizens who are near you geographically . Ironically , the tools you 're offered if you visit Twitter.com have changed very little in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Twitter tools available everywhere else . As the tools have multiplied , we 're discovering extraordinary new things to do with them . Last month an anticommunist uprising in Moldova was organized via Twitter . Twitter has become so widely used among political activists in China that the government recently blocked access to it , in an attempt to censor discussion of the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre . A service called SickCity scans the Twitter feeds from multiple urban areas , tracking references to flu and fever . Celebrity Twitterers like Kutcher have directed their vast followings toward charitable causes ( in Kutcher 's case , the Malaria No More organization ) . Social networks are notoriously vulnerable to the fickle tastes of teens and 20-somethings ( remember Friendster ? ) , so it 's entirely possible that three or four years from now , we 'll have moved on to some Twitter successor . But the key elements of the Twitter platform -- the follower structure , link-sharing , real-time searching -- will persevere regardless of Twitter 's fortunes , just as Web conventions like links , posts and feeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every major channel of information will be Twitterfied in one way or another in the coming years : NEWS AND OPINION . Increasingly , the stories that come across our radar -- news about a plane crash , a feisty Op-Ed , a gossip item -- will arrive via the passed links of the people we follow . Instead of being built by some kind of artificially intelligent software algorithm , a customized newspaper will be compiled from all the articles being read that morning by your social network . This will lead to more news diversity and polarization at the same time : your networked front page will be more eclectic than any traditional-newspaper front page , but political partisans looking to enhance their own private echo chamber will be able to tune out opposing viewpoints more easily . SEARCHING . As the archive of links shared by Twitter users grows , the value of searching for information via your extended social network will start to rival Google 's approach to the search . If you 're looking for information on Benjamin Franklin , an essay shared by one of your favorite historians might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if you 're looking for advice on sibling rivalry , an article recommended by a friend of a friend might well be the best place to start . ADVERTISING . Today the language of advertising is dominated by the notion of impressions : how many times an advertiser can get its brand in front of a potential customer 's eyeballs , whether on a billboard , a Web page or a NASCAR hood . But impressions are fleeting things , especially compared with the enduring relationships of followers . Successful businesses will have millions of Twitter followers ( and will pay good money to attract them ) , and a whole new language of tweet-based customer interaction will evolve to keep those followers engaged : early access to new products or deals , live customer service , customer involvement in brainstorming for new products . Not all these developments will be entirely positive . Most of us have learned firsthand how addictive the micro-events of our personal e-mail inbox can be . But with the ambient awareness of status updates from Twitter and Facebook , an entire new empire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you compulsively checked your BlackBerry to see if anything new had happened in your personal life or career : e-mail from the boss , a reply from last night 's date . Now you 're compulsively checking your BlackBerry for news from other people 's lives . And because , on Twitter at least , some of those people happen to be celebrities , the Twitter platform is likely to expand that strangely delusional relationship that we have to fame . When Oprah tweets a question about getting ticks off her dog , as she did recently , anyone can send an @ reply to her , and in that exchange , there is the semblance of a normal , everyday conversation between equals . But of course , Oprah has more than a million followers , and that isolated query probably elicited thousands of responses . Who knows what small fraction of her @ replies she has time to read ? But from the fan 's perspective , it feels refreshingly intimate : " As I was explaining to Oprah last night , when she asked about dog ticks ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter is not new , of course . Facebook , whose audience is still several times as large as Twitter 's , went from being a way to scope out the most attractive college freshmen to the Social Operating System of the Internet , supporting a vast ecosystem of new applications created by major media companies , individual hackers , game creators , political groups and charities . The Apple iPhone 's long-term competitive advantage may well prove to be the more than 15,000 new applications that have been developed for the device , expanding its functionality in countless ingenious ways . The history of the Web followed a similar pattern . A platform originally designed to help scholars share academic documents , it now lets you watch television shows , play poker with strangers around the world , publish your own newspaper , rediscover your high school girlfriend -- and , yes , tell the world what you had for breakfast . Twitter serves as the best poster child for this new model of social creativity in part because these innovations have flowered at such breathtaking speed and in part because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's creators dared us to do something interesting by giving us a platform with such draconian restrictions . And sure enough , we accepted the dare with relish . Just 140 characters ? I wonder if I could use that to start a political uprising . The speed with which users have extended Twitter 's platform points to a larger truth about modern innovation . When we talk about innovation and global competitiveness , we tend to fall back on the easy metric of patents and Ph.D.s . It turns out the U.S. share of both has been in steady decline since peaking in the early ' 70s . ( In 1970 , more than 50% of the world 's graduate degrees in science and engineering were issued by U.S. universities . ) Since the mid- ' 80s , a long progression of doomsayers have warned that our declining market share in the patents-and-Ph.D.s business augurs dark times for American innovation . The specific threats have changed . It was the Japanese who would destroy us in the ' 80s ; now it 's China and India . But what actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with America Online , Netscape , Amazon , Google , Blogger , Wikipedia , Craigslist , TiVo , Netflix , eBay , the iPod and iPhone , Xbox , Facebook and Twitter itself . Sure , we did n't build the Prius or the Wii , but if you measure global innovation in terms of actual lifestyle-changing hit products and not just grad students , the U.S. has been lapping the field for the past 20 years . How could the forecasts have been so wrong ? The answer is that we 've been tracking only part of the innovation story . If I go to grad school and invent a better mousetrap , I 've created value , which I can protect with a patent and capitalize on by selling my invention to consumers . But if someone else figures out a way to use my mousetrap to replace his much more expensive washing machine , he 's created value as well . We tend to put the emphasis on the first kind of value creation because there are a small number of inventors who earn giant paydays from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses that find value in these innovations by figuring out new ways to put them to use . There are several varieties of this kind of innovation , and they go by different technical names . MIT professor Eric von Hippel calls one " end-user innovation , " in which consumers actively modify a product to adapt it to their needs . In its short life , Twitter has been a hothouse of end-user innovation : the hashtag ; searching ; its 11,000 third-party applications ; all those creative new uses of Twitter -- some of them banal , some of them spam and some of them sublime . Think about the community invention of the @ reply . It took a service that was essentially a series of isolated microbroadcasts , each individual tweet an island , and turned Twitter into a truly conversational medium . All of these adoptions create new kinds of value in the wider economy , and none of them actually originated at Twitter HQ . You do n't need patents or Ph.D.s to build on this kind of platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twitter phenomenon . We are living through the worst economic crisis in generations , with apocalyptic headlines threatening the end of capitalism as we know it , and yet in the middle of this chaos , the engineers at Twitter headquarters are scrambling to keep the servers up , application developers are releasing their latest builds , and ordinary users are figuring out all the ingenious ways to put these tools to use . There 's a kind of resilience here that is worth savoring . The weather reports keep announcing that the sky is falling , but here we are -- millions of us -- sitting around trying to invent new ways to talk to one another .
