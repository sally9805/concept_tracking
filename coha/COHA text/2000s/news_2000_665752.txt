Gen. Shaul Mofaz , said that the rules of war in Lebanon were being changed , and that Israel would retaliate for military casualties as well as Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israeli bordern towns . <p> With the latest death , the new policy was being put to a test . Prime Minister Ehud Barak , who also serves as defense minister , does not have to seek Cabinet approval to order new bombing raids . This week 's bombardment of Lebanon , including strikes against power stations , was the most intense in eight months . <p> The guerrillas have intensified their attacks on Israeli troops in recent weeks . <p> Ex-general Shlomo Brom , head of military planning until 1998 , said the guerrillas have displayed new prowess by scoring direct hits on Israeli outposts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the guerrillas have had the missiles for some time , but better training has made them more proficient in their use . <p> Sneh denied Hezbollah was becoming more skilled in firing missiles . " They launch countless numbers of missiles and some of them really hit , " he said . <p> Some of the TOW missiles might have passed through Israel on their way to Iran . During the 1980s , Israel transferred the U.S.-made weapons to Iran and received replacements in a deal that blew up into a scandal known as " Irangate . " Brom said it is " likely " some of the Irangate missiles are now in the hands of Hezbollah . <p> Since 1985 , Israeli soldiers have occupied a strip of Lebanese territory , engaging Hezbollah guerrillas there to keep them away from the border . Hezbollah leaders say their goal is to end the Israeli occupation . <p> Israeli stamina is wearing thin over the growing casualties and tension along the border .
