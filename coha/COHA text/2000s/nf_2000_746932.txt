Researches Scramble To Find Controls for the New Woodlands Invader . <p> Monitoring the munching sounds made by Asian longhorned beetles ( ALB ) may help scientists home in on which trees are infested . This is just one of several new tactics that Agricultural Research Service scientists are now exploring to find ways to control these wood-boring pests . <p> " Trees infested by the Asian longhorned beetles were first found in the United States in New York in 1996 and then in Chicago in 1998 , " says ARS entomologist Michael T. Smith . " Adult beetles have also been intercepted at ports in 17 states . " <p> According to reports from USDA 's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) , if this beetle spreads unchecked , it could cause billions of dollars in damage to ornamental trees and forests and to the maple syrup , lumber , and tourism industries . <p> Two highly prized and well-known urban parks in the United States  --  New York City 's Central Park and Chicago 's Lincoln Park  --  are presently at risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found to be infested with ALB . While the infested trees have been removed , there is concern that the insects may have already spread to other trees in the parks . <p> Smith , who works at the ARS Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Laboratory in Newark , Delaware , is fast becoming one of the world 's experts on these pests . He has spent considerable time over the past 2 years in interior China , conducting collaborative field studies with his Chinese colleagues on key aspects of the beetle 's behavior , as well as its natural enemies . He and his colleagues are simultaneously carrying out additional studies here in the United States . <p> Native to China and Korea , Anoplophora glabripennis causes widespread mortality of poplar , willow , elm , and maple throughout vast areas of China . <p> " Most of the damage can be found in trees along streets , windbreaks around agricultural fields , hedgerows , plantations , and manmade forests , " says Smith . Together with the large number of hardwood tree species thus far found infested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ash , to mention a few  --  this beetle can probably survive and reproduce in most sections of the country where suitable host trees exist . <p> The adult  --  over an inch long  --  is coal black with yellow or white spots and has long antennae with white bands . A female beetle spends considerable time chewing a small groove and hole through the bark to the cambium . Then she carefully inserts a single egg about the size of a rice grain through the hole and underneath the inner bark onto the outer surface of the wood , or xylem . She plugs the hole with digested wood known as " frass . " <p> " Because of her efforts , young ALB are safe and well hidden , " Smith says . He has documented female beetles taking 50 to 72 minutes to complete egglaying . He is currently studying hours of video data of this and other ALB behaviors , so he considers these results to be preliminary . <p> " Based on published Chinese research , a female lays an average of about 35 eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 days , " he says . " Then , the young grubs , or larvae , start eating the tree 's cambium , first disrupting its nutrient-transporting vessels . After shedding their skin twice , the larvae start boring into the wood of the tree , gnawing into the tougher , water-transporting vessels deeper inside . " <p> So far , the only solution has been to cut down and remove infested trees . In the U.S. eradication program , infested trees are also chipped into tiny pieces after they are taken down . Chips are sometimes even incinerated . <p> A method for detecting and monitoring adult ALB is needed . One such method may be a pheromone lure  --  a scent produced by one sex to attract the other . <p> Last May , ARS entomologist Jeffrey R. Aldrich and chemists James E. Oliver and Aijun Zhang of the ARS Insect Chemical Ecology Laboratory in Beltsville , Maryland , isolated , identified , and synthesized two compounds from quarantined ALB as potential lures . In preliminary laboratory tests , these compounds appeared to stimulate flight and walking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last July failed to demonstrate that the beetles are attracted to either compound . Additional field tests are planned . Stephen A. Teale , an entomologist at State University of New York-Syracuse , has been working for more than 2 years on this as well . He has isolated several compounds that he 's been testing in China . How Do You Detect Them ? <p> Detection of ALB-infested trees has largely depended on visual examination of trees . Trunks are checked for insects and telltale signs  --  a small slit left by the female when she lays an egg , sawdust or sap coming from this slit , or dime-sized holes made by new adults emerging from the tree , says Smith . <p> APHIS estimates that inspectors identify only about one-third of the beetle-infested trees in situations where inspectors stand below and use binoculars to examine the trees . This has been the primary method used since 1996 in the New York infestation . <p> In Chicago , cherry pickers and tree climbers have been used to detect infested trees , and APHIS has reported improved detection efficiency from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly and time-consuming . <p> Smith has been working with Teale to find a better system for detecting infested trees . They 're developing an acoustic beetle detector that homes in on the beetle 's munching sounds as they tunnel . <p> " The pest spends most of its life  --  about a year  --  as a larva inside a tree before emerging as an adult . We 're working on a device that can pick up the sounds of tunneling larvae , " says Smith . <p> So far , they 've successfully recorded the beetles within standing live poplar and willow trees in China . These recordings were made under fairly noisy conditions to better simulate those under which this system is needed to operate in the United States . <p> In addition , successful recordings were made of ALB feeding up to 6.5 yards away from the recording device . " This will be particularly important since one of our goals is to provide a tool that inspectors could use to check trees without initially having to climb them , " he says . <p> To distinguish beetle-chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with a specialist on a feeding-noise recognition system . " It would generate an acoustic fingerprint of the beetle as the larvae feed on the two tree tissues they commonly inhabit  --  inner bark and inner wood , " he says . " Besides recording the chewing sounds of the beetles , we will be recording and developing an archive of the insect-munching sounds created by other chewers that also inhabit trees commonly infested by the beetle . <p> If successful , Smith and Teale hope that by early this fall they will have a functional prototype system for identifying ALB-infected trees by the chewing noises coming from them . Other Control Tactics <p> Smith is also examining the biology of invasion for this beetle , which includes studies being conducted under natural field conditions in China in cooperation with Gao Ruitong and Li Guohong of the Chinese Academy of Forestry in Beijing , China . <p> " We hope to find exploitable nicks in the pest 's armor  --  points in its life cycle we can take advantage of  --  to develop eradication or management tools , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adult beetles while they inhabit the tree , including how male and female beetles find , recognize , and mate with one another and the steps leading to egg laying , feeding ( by adults ) , and host tree selection . <p> To date , Smith has uncovered new information never before recorded on ALB behavior , as well as identified several behaviors that are potentially exploitable for eradication or management . <p> Second , by observing the beetles ' flight behavior in a single flight , he is assessing their ability to fly ( distance , rate , in-flight orientation , etc . ) . <p> " Thus far , preliminary data analysis indicates that the average distance a beetle flies in a single flight is about 50 yards , " Smith says . " However , since single flight distance may be largely influenced by the distance between trees within the landscape , this may underestimate the average single flight distance in urban landscapes where trees are more widely spaced . Our data show that ALB are capable of single flights of over 437 yards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under natural field conditions in China . He wants to show how groups of ALB move over an entire season ( in multiple flights ) . <p> " We 're uncovering new information on the potential rate of population spread , " says Smith . " It 's particularly important that we conduct our initial studies in areas where the trees are spaced about the same as they are in the areas infested in the United States . " <p> The immediate use of this information is to help APHIS , which oversees the ALB eradication program , establish the outer boundaries of its quarantined areas , as well as predict the direction and rate of spread from infestations in New York and Chicago . <p> Results from these studies will also be used by ARS entomologist Jay S. Bancroft at the Newark laboratory to develop models for predicting ALB population dispersal within various landscapes  --  such as parks , woodlots , plantations , and forests  --  that are at risk within the United States , according to Smith . <p> " While this is the first year of our multiyear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger flyers than previously thought , " says Smith . " Preliminary analysis indicates that they are capable of dispersing an average of 328 yards over an entire season . However , the maximum dispersal distance recorded in this study was over 1,530 yards . " The study will be repeated in the year 2000 . <p> A recent report listed the ALB flight distance as only 40 to 50 feet . Referring to this report , Smith says , " based upon our 1999 studies of both population dispersal and individual flight behavior , ALB is certainly capable of dispersing or flying well beyond 50 feet . " He is apprehensive that these flight distances underestimate the insects ' flight ability or range . <p> To complement these field studies , lab studies of key aspects of ALB biology are being carried out with Smith 's ARS biological technician Joseph M. Tropp at Newark . <p> " These studies will provide new information on the daily reproductive capacity of adult female beetles over their life span , " Smith says . This is particularly important in light of the beetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found infested in the United States . <p> Finally , ARS entomologist Keith R. Hopper at the Newark laboratory , whose expertise is in the population biology of invasion , is collaborating with Smith on his studies of ALB colonization behavior and population dispersal . <p> Using molecular markers , Hopper and Smith are working to determine the genetic structure of ALB populations in China . By comparing the beetles ' genetics , they plan to show whether beetles tend to stay in the same tree or move often between trees and to provide additional evidence about how far the beetles move . This information will be used to determine sampling procedures for ALB in the United States . Natural Enemies <p> In 1999 , Smith , working with Yang Zhong-qi of the Chinese Academy of Forestry , initiated studies of the known natural enemies of ALB and other closely related longhorned beetle species in China . They want to evaluate known natural enemies of ALB in China , as well as find and evaluate new ones , with an emphasis on parasites of egg and early larval stages . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood borers indigenous to the United States that may be potential biocontrols of ALB as well . <p> Besides this ongoing research , Smith says studies are planned that will address questions of host-tree preference and suitability for larval growth and development . These efforts will involve many researchers and organizations , including APHIS , Penn State University , University of Illinois , State University of New York-Syracuse , and the Chinese Academy of Forestry , to name a few . <p> This research is part of Crop Protection and Quarantine , an ARS National Program ( #304 ) described on the Worm Wide Web at http : **41;2888;TOOLONG <p> Michael T.
