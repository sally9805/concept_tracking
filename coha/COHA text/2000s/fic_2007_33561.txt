February 16 , 1809 Talenka , Montavia The Balkans The Window to Heaven was shattered . Only moonlight and cold wind streamed through the huge circular cavity where splendor and beauty had once reigned . Marianna dug her fingers into the door to keep herself upright as she stared at the devastation . The journey had taken too long . She had failed Mama . The pattern was smashed ; the Jedalar was gone . Then she forgot everything else as the deep sense of loss over the act of sheer desecration hit home . She knew the Jedalar should be more important to her but , dear heaven , all that wonder and beauty gone forever . Why was she so stunned ? They had destroyed everything else in her life . Perhaps it was even fitting that this last beautiful remnant had died . " Marianna . " Alex tugged at her arm . " I think I hear them ! " She went rigid , listening . She heard nothing , just the wind whistling among the shelled and deserted houses of the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the floor of the church , her gaze searching the ruins that had once been the town of Talenka . She still heard nothing , but Alex had always possessed sharper hearing than she . " Are you sure ? " " No , but I think . . . " He tilted his head . " Yes ! " She should never have come back . She should have taken the road to the south . Hermother would have forgiven her . They had not taken quite everything from her . She still had Alex , and by God , she would not let him die . She slammed the heavy brass-studded door and dragged Alex behind her as she tore down the long aisle toward the altar , stumbling over a broken iron candelabra and several fat white candles scattered on the marble floor . The soldiers had wreaked their usual havoc here , she thought grimly . Everything of value had either been stolen or destroyed . The gold crucifix that had once adorned the wall beneath the Window to Heaven had vanished ; the statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been toppled from the pedestal . " Horses , " Alex whispered.She heard them now too . The sharp clip-clop of hooves on the cobblestoned street outside . " They wo n't find us , " she whispered back . " They did n't see us come in , and those pigs can have no traffic with either churches or prayers . " She pulled the little boy behind a column beside the altar and crouched down beside him . " But we will stay here awhile and wait for them to go away . " Alex shivered and drew closer to her . " What if they do come ? " " They wo n't . " She slid an arm around his shoulders . He was thinner than he had been last week , she realized in concern , and he had been coughing all day . The scraps of food she had managed to salvage from the deserted farmhouses outside the town had barely been enough to keep them alive . " What if they do ? " Alex repeated . Heavens , he was persistent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know the duke 's soldiers would n't come , she thought wearily . She could not be sure of anything or anyone . She doubted if those monsters would come to worship , but they might come to loot and burn again . " If they come , we will hide here in the shadows and be very quiet until they leave . Can you do that ? " He nodded , his weight heavier against her . " I 'm cold , Marianna . " " I know . As soon as we hear them leave , we 'll look for shelter for the night . " " Can we light a fire ? " She shook her head . " But maybe we can find a blanket for you . " " And for you . " He smiled at her-only a faint smile , but it was enough to light his face with the cherubic radiance that had led her mother to use him as a model in her last work . It was the first time she had seen him smile since the night they had-Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not think of that night or anything that happened since . She had found it weakened her , and she must stay strong for Alex . " A blanket for me too . " She wanted to lean forward and kiss him , but Alex had reached the advanced age of four and regarded himself as too old for such a display of affection . " Just as soon as they leave the village . " But they were n't leaving . They were coming closer . She could hear the horses just outside the church and men 's voices laughing and talking . Her heart pounded as she drew Alex closer . Let them go away , she prayed frantically . Mother of God , let them not come into the church . Footsteps on the stone stairs . The muscles of her stomach tightened painfully . " Marianna ? " " Shhh . " Her hand clamped over Alex 's mouth . The door creaked as it swung open . So much for prayers . Now she must do as her mother had taught her and rely only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Tears stung her eyes until she could barely see the man standing in the doorway . She blinked . She had not cried since it had happened , and she would not cry now . Tears were for the weak , and she must be strong . She watched the man start down the aisle . He was tall , very tall , his stride long and purposeful , his dark cloak billowing behind him like the wings of a vulture . He was not in the duke 's livery , but that did n't mean he was n't the enemy . No one followed him , she noticed in relief . He had left those other pigs outside . She had a better chance of besting one man . He stumbled in the darkness and muttered a curse . She heard Alex 's gasp beneath her hand . There had been many curses that night , curses and laughter and screams . She had held Alex to her breast so he would not see , but she had not been able to keep him from hearing . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stumbled again and then stopped , stooped , and picked up something from the floor . A few minutes later a tiny flame of light pierced the darkness as he lit the stub of a broken candle he had retrieved . She shrank farther back into the shadows , her gaze raking the enemy to search out weakness.Dark hair tied back in a queue , a long face , a glimmer of green eyes . He lifted the candle high , his eyes searching the darkness until he found the gaping hole that had once been the Window to Heaven . His hand tightened on the candle ; his face contorted in an expression of demonic fury . " Damnation ! " His booted foot kicked out at the shards of glass on the marble floor . " Dammit to hell ! " He 'd cursed in English . He must be English , like Papa , but she had never seen Papa in a fury like this . Alex whimpered . The man stiffened . " Who 's there ? " He was turning toward them ! She tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he saw them , they would be helpless prey . Their only weapon was surprise . " Stay here , " she whispered . " Wait ! " She pushed Alex still farther behind the column , darted forward , and charged the man . " What the dev-Oof . " Her head connected with the stomach and knocked the breath out of him . She grabbed the broken iron candelabra from the floor and brought it up between his legs . He gasped and doubled over in agony . " Alex ! Come ! " she called . Alex was behind her in seconds , and she grabbed his hand and ran up the aisle . But before they reached the door , she was knocked down and hit the floor , hard . He had tackled her ! He flipped her over and leaped astride her . Helpless . She was as helpless as Mama had been . " No ! " She struggled wildly . " Lie still , damn you . " Alex leaped on the man 's back , his thin arms encircling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Run ! " She felt the man above her tense . " My God ! " he muttered , and then added in disgust , " Children ! " He leaped to his feet , throwing off Alex 's hold . Marianna scrambled to her knees and reached for the candelabra she had dropped . " Marianna ! " She looked up to see her brother struggling in the arms of the man . She lunged up at him , wielding the candelabra , but Alex was immediately lifted as a shield between them . " Oh no , not again , " he said grimly , this time in Montavian . " I will not permit a second assault on my person . I have other plans for my manhood . " As all men did . She wished she had a sword to cut his off . " Let him down , " she said fiercely . " Presently . " He must be very strong ; he was holding Alex as if he were weightless . " But only if you promise not to attack me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'll find a way to hurt you again . " " Ah , another threat . You 're a little young to deal in threats . " She took a step closer . He stiffened , his wary gaze on the iron weapon in her hands . " Keep your distance . " As she stopped , he relaxed a little . " One of the first things you should learn is that the man who possesses the prize dictates the terms . Now , I seem to have captured an object you value . " He backed away from her a few paces . " He 's very small , is n't he ? Small children are so easy to hurt . " Fear ripped through her . " I 'll kill you if you- " " I have no intention of harming him , " he interrupted . " Not if you do n't force me to defend myself . " She studied him . His thick dark hair had come loose from its queue and framed a long face that was all planes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and his nose reminded her of the beak of an eagle . It was a hard face , a face as inflexible as stone , the face of a man who could be cruel . " Answer my questions , and I 'll set this young man down , " he said . " I assure you I do n't usually make war on children . " She did not trust him , but she had little choice . " What do you want to know ? " " What are you doing here ? " She searched wildly for an answer he would believe . " It was cold , and we needed shelter for the night . " " There 's not much shelter here with that window broken . " His gaze was on her face , reading her expression . He did n't believe her , she realized in despair . She had never been good at lying . He continued . " Perhaps you 're a thief . Perhaps you came in here to see what you could steal . It would n't be- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerently . " She only wanted to see the window , but it was gone . She would never- " " Hush , Alex , " she said sharply . It was n't Alex 's fault . He was only defending her and did n't know the importance of the Jedalar . " The window ? " He glanced up over his shoulder . " Hell yes , it 's gone . " That terrible anger twisted his face again . " Bastards ! I wanted that window . " He wanted the Window to Heaven . Then he must be one of them ! " Who . . . who . . . are you ? " His gaze narrowed on her face . " Not Mephistopheles , as you seem to hink . Who do you think I am ? " She moistened her lips . " I think you belong to the Duke of Nebrov . " " I belong to no one . " His lips tightened . " Certainly not to that whoreson bastard . I don't- Ouch ! " Alex 's teeth had sunk into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retaliated against the boy . But he merely shook off the boy 's teeth . " It seems the cub is also fierce . " " He 's afraid . Let him down . " " I 'll strike a bargain with you . I 'll put him down if you promise not to run away . " He had seemed sincere in his dislike of the duke , but that did n't mean he was not the enemy . He wanted the Window . " You put him down and let him leave us , and I 'll not run away . " " But then I 'll not have my shield . " She smiled with fierce satisfaction . " No . " His lips quirked , but he did not smile in turn . " Done . I think I can protect myself from one small girl . Drop your weapon . " She hesitated and then dropped the candelabra . " Good . Your promise ? " She had hoped he would not demand the words . " I promise , " she said grudgingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger to Alex . " He set the little boy on his feet . " There 's no danger here for the boy . " There was danger everywhere , and she must be prepared to face it . She turned to Alex . " Go to the garden and wait for me there . " " I do n't want to go . " She did n't want Alex to go either . The night was cold and he was ill and she did not know how long this Englishman would keep her here . But there was no choice . Alex had to be sent out of harm 's way . She took off her wool shawl and wrapped it around him . " But you must . " She gave him a gentle push . " I 'll be with you soon . " He started to protest , but when he met her gaze , he turned and ran toward the small door to the left of the altar . She was alone with him . Mama . What if he hurt her the way they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbing her of breath , freezing her blood as she turned to face him . " You sent away my hostage , " he said mockingly . He set one of the candelabras upright , found the candle he had dropped , and relit it . " It makes me feel exceptionally insecure . I do n't know if I can tolerate-Why the devil are you shaking like that ? " " I 'm not . " Her eyes shimmered with defiance . " I 'm not afraid . " He could see that she was more than afraid ; she was terrified . It was probably good that she feared him ; fear would produce answers , but for some inexplicable reason he felt the need to save her pride . " I did n't say you were . It must be the cold . You gave the boy your shawl . " He took off his cloak . " Come here and let me put this around you . " She looked at the cloak as if it were a sword pointed at her . She took a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must make me a promise . You must not kill me afterward . Alex needs me . " " After what ? " he asked . His gaze narrowed on her face , and he understood . " You think I intend to rape you ? " " It 's what men do to women . " " How old are you ? " " I 've reached my sixteenth year . " " You look younger . " In the loose , ragged blouse and skirt she wore her body appeared to be as straight and without womanly form as that of a child . She was small-boned , delicate , almost painfully thin , with a smudge darkening one cheek . Her fair hair was pulled back in a long braid and added to the effect of extreme and vulnerable youth . She stared at him scornfully . " What difference does it make how old I am ? I 'm female , and men do n't care . They care for nothing . " She sounded so certain , he felt a surge of pity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not to me . " Her tone was suddenly reserved . He could almost see her withdraw within herself , sidling away from the pain she would not discuss . " And it wo n't happen now , " he said grimly . " I 'm not known to be above debauchery , but I do n't rape children . " But she was n't a child . The delicate beauty of her features should have reflected wonder instead of raw wariness ; her clear blue eyes gazed at him with a worldliness far beyond her years , and her lips were set tight to prevent their trembling . He had seen the same look on the faces of the children in the towns and villages along Kazan 's border , and it made him as angry now as it had then . " Where are your parents ? " She did not answer at once , and when she did , she spoke so softly , he had to strain to hear . " Dead . " " How ? " " Papa died two years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I . . . do n't want to tell you . " " How did your mother die ? " he repeated . " The duke . " He remembered her earlier accusation . " The Duke of Nebrov ? " She nodded . It was no surprise to him . The powerful Duke of Nebrov had launched an insurrection against his brother , King Josef , over a year ago . It had been a bitter struggle , and both armies had almost been destroyed before the duke had been forced to acknowledge a defeat . The king 's forces had been too scattered and weak to pursue Nebrov to his own lands , where he was now licking his wounds and undoubtedly building a new army . As he retreated , he had made sure that Montavia suffered as much as possible and given his men free rein to rape and pillage as they pleased . On Jordan 's journey to Talenka from Kazan he had traveled through town after town like this one that had been shelled and sacked , its inhabitants murdered and brutalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ? " She shook her head . " The duke , " she whispered . She stared straight ahead as if the scene was there before her . " He did it . He did it . " " The duke himself ? " That was unusual . Zarek Nebrov was a brutal bastard , but his rage was usually cold and controlled , and he seldom indulged in spilling blood without reason . " Are you sure ? " " He came to our cottage , and he . . . I 'm sure . " She shuddered . " Mama told me who he was . . . . She had seen him before . He hurt . . . her , and then he killed her . " " Why ? " He received no reply . " Did you hear me ? " " I hear you , " she said haltingly . " If you do not wish to hurt me , may I go now ? " Christ , he felt as brutal a bastard as Nebrov . The girl was helpless and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send one of his men to find the girl 's nearest relations and take her to them . But he knew he had to find out more . The coincidence was too blatant . She had come to see the Window and , by her few agonized words , it appeared the girl 's mother had been tortured before she had been killed . Nebrov never did anything without reason . " No , you may not go . " He held out his cloak to her again . " You will put on this cloak . " He deliberately kept his tone hard , but he sat down in a pew so that he would appear less threatening . Standing , he felt like a giant looming over her fragile form . " Sit down . " " I wo n't talk about that anymore , " she said unsteadily . " No matter what you do to me . " That painful memory was probably her biggest weakness , but he found he could n't strike at it . " Stay , " he said wearily . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night again . " She hesitated , her gaze searching his face . Then she took his cloak and slipped it on but did not sit down . " Why do you want me to stay ? " " I 'm not sure . " He was probably wasting his time here . He had done all he could . Now that he knew the Window was destroyed , his only course was to meet with Janus so that he could carry the word to Kazan and then set out for Samda and try to find Pogani . Even if this waif knew something she was n't telling , the Window was broken , dammit . Yet he could n't let it rest until he was certain Nebrov had n't discovered something he had not . His gaze returned to the cavity surrounded by jagged glass . " It seems strange that we were both brought together at this place and time . Do you believe in Fate ? " " No . " " I do . My mother had Tartar blood , and she must have instilled a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare never left the empty window . " The town is sacked and deserted , you could n't be sure the duke 's forces would n't return , you and your brother are ragged and in want , and yet you picked this time to come to see the Window ? Why ? " " Why did you ? " she countered . " I wished to acquire it . I heard it was magnificent , and I wished to take it back to my home . " " You wished to steal it . " " You do n't understand . " " You wished to steal it , " she repeated , her tone uncompromising . " All right , have it your way . I wished to steal it . " He met her gaze . " Now , why did you come ? " Those clear , fierce eyes slid away from his own . " I had to see if it was still there . " " Why ? " She did n't reply . " It would be wise of you to answer me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tone was scornful as she echoed his own life . " Why , I heard it was magnificent , and I wanted it for my home . " The girl had courage . She was still frightened , and yet she refused to yield . He was careful not to show the flicker of admiration he felt . " Shall I go to the garden and fetch your brother ? I 'm sure he would tell me why you 're here . " " Leave him alone ! " " Then tell me the truth . " She burst out , " Because it was mine ! " Christ ! He hid the excitement that jolted through him . " The pope would not agree . Everything in his churches belongs to God and so to him . " " It is mine , " she said fiercely . " My grandmother gave it to me before she died last year . " He was careful to keep his expression impassive . " How kind of her . And what right did she have to bestow such a gift ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not pay us for the work , so it was still ours . " " I fear she told you a falsehood . The Window was created by Anton Pogani , a great craftsman . " She shook her head . " He was my grandfather , but it was n't he who was the craftsman , it was my grandmother . " His brows lifted . " A woman ? " Surely no woman could have had the artistry and skill to create the Window 's twenty-three panels portraying man 's climb from the earthly plane to Paradise . " That 's why she had to let him lay claim to the work . They would not have accepted the work of a woman . It is always our women who do the work . " " Always ? " She nodded . " For over five hundred years the women in my family have worked with glass . We 're trained from the time we leave the cradle . My mother said I have a special gift , and when I 'm grown , I will be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hope shot through him . " And just how familiar are you with the Window to Heaven ? " He had deliberately kept his tone offhand , but she went rigid . Wariness when there should have been no such response . He retreated quickly and changed the subject . " What do the men of your family do while you 're creating these glorious works ? " A little of her tension eased . " Whatever they wish . They are well taken care of . " " Then it 's the women who work to provide the living and care for the men of the family ? " She looked at him , frowning . " Of course , it is our duty . We always- Why are you looking at me like that ? " " Forgive me if I find the idea extraordinary . " She shifted uneasily . " I must go . Alex is waiting . " " And where will you go ? I assume your home is in ruins like the rest of Talenka . " " We did n't live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over seventy miles to the west . " Then how did you get here ? " " We walked . " The journey from Samda through this war-ravaged land would have been a rough , dangerous trek even for a man on horseback , and yet the child had been driven to forge her way to the church on foot . " Do you have relatives in Samda ? " " I have no one anywhere , " she said matter-of-factly , but desolation echoed beneath the words . He had a sense of everything coming together . After all the hell and blood that had gone before , Fate had finally got it right ! He had n't even had to go to Pogani ; the Jedalar had come to him . " Then I 'll take you with me . " She stared at him , stunned . " Come with me , " he repeated . His eyes glinted with recklessness . " It 's clear you were sent to me as a gift , and I never refuse a gift from the gods . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had gone mad . Well , he felt a little mad at the moment . Despair and anger had changed to hope , and that could be a heady brew . " How can you take care of your Alex without help ? He needs hot food and warm clothing . I can give it to you . " She hesitated . " Why . . . would you do this ? " " Perhaps I wish to do my kindly Christian duty and aid two orphans , " he said mockingly . Those clear blue eyes searched his expression . " But I think you 're not a kind man . " " How clever of you to realize that fact , but you 're not entirely correct . " I do practice kindness . . . when it 's convenient . It is convenient now . Is n't that fortunate for you and your Alex ? " She shook her head , her gaze clinging to his . He could see she wanted desperately to be convinced . All he had to do was say the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to proceed . Persuading women to do as he wanted them to do had never been a problem for him . He had learned to charm and beguile before he left the nursery . Yet he was curiously reluctant to lie to this big-eyed waif . " You 're quite right . I 've never been known to follow the path of duty . I 've always found it an abysmal bore . " He continued crisply . " Very well , I do have a reason for wanting to help you , but I have no intention of divulging it at present . If you want to come with me , then you 'll do so on my terms . You 'll agree to obey me without question , and in return I 'll promise that there will be food and shelter and protection for both of you as long as you 're under my care . If you choose not to come , then you can stay here in these ruins and let your brother starve to death . " He turned and started back up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of leaving her here even if it meant abducting her , but it would be simpler if she made the decision . " Wait . " He stopped but did n't turn around . " You 're coming with me ? " " Yes . " She moved brusquely forward ahead of him . " I 'll go with you . " She added quickly , " For now . But Alex stays in the garden until I 'm sure it 's safe . I 'll take food and blankets to him . " " As you like . But you 'd better make up your mind quickly . I intend to leave this town by sunrise . " " That 's too soon , " she said , panic-stricken . " Sunrise , " he repeated . " What did the boy call you ? Marianna ? " " Marianna Sanders . " " Sanders . " He opened the heavy door for her . " That 's not a Montavian name . " " My father was English . " She slanted him a glance . " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen the broken window . " And your mother ? " She looked away from him . " Montavian . " She asked quickly , " Why is an Englishman in Montavia ? " " Because he wants to be , " he said mockingly . " You 've not asked me my name . I 'm hurt you have so little interest when we 're to be fast companions . " " Well , what is it ? " she said impatiently . He bowed . " Jordan Draken . At your service . " A sharp gust of wind struck them as they started down the steps , and she frowned . " It 's getting colder . I need that blanket for Alex . I ca n't leave him out there without- " " Ah , Jordan , you were in the church so long , I thought you were taking holy vows , " a voice boomed . Marianna stopped short on the steps as she saw the huge man coming toward them . She had thought Jordan Draken was tall , but this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The giant threw back his head , and his laugh again boomed out . " I should have known you would have found a woman to amuse you even in this deserted hovel . " As he drew closer , the moonlight revealed a face as intimidating as his great bulk . He must be near his fortieth year , and his face reflected evidence that those years had been spent in violence . His nose had been broken , and his gray-streaked black hair was a wild , tousled tangle framing cheekbones that looked as if they had been chipped from a mountain . A jagged white scar curved from his left eye , across his cheek to the corner of his mouth . " Easy , " Draken said quietly . " It 's only Gregor . He wo n't hurt you . " How did she know that ? she wondered wildly . She looked beyond the giant to the men who sat astride their horses at the foot of the steps . There were at least fifteen of them , several bearing flaming torches , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black fur hats and strange , quilted bulky tunics trimmed with fox fur and sheepskin , their wide trousers tucked into high leather boots that reached their knees . Rifles were holstered on their saddles , and each man wore a huge sword at his hip . Why had she consented to come with Draken ? She knew the answer . Alex was ill . Alex must have warmth and shelter , and it had seemed worth any risk to see if this man could give it to him . " Stay where you are , Gregor . " Draken turned to her as the giant stopped on the fifth step . " No one will hurt you . I gave you my promise . " And he had not lied to persuade her to come with him , she remembered . He had given her a choice , and she had made it . She must n't be a coward now . She threw her shoulders back and demanded , " Tell him to give me a blanket for Alex . " An undefinable expression crossed his face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go fetch a blanket for the lady . " He nodded his shaggy head and loped back down the steps to a giant of a horse . He opened a saddlebag and took out a sheepskin blanket . He turned , took the stairs three at a time , and stopped before Marianna . " Here . " He thrust the blanket at her and smiled with surprising sweetness . " I 'm Gregor Damek , and I know I 'm an ugly monster of a fellow , but I do n't eat children . I promise you . " In that terrifying visage , his hazel eyes were gentle , and she felt the tiniest ripple of warmth go through her as she took the blanket . " My . . . name is Marianna , " she said haltingly . " Take the blanket to your brother , " Draken said to her . " We 'll set up camp at the north edge of the town . There will be hot food and a warm fire for you both .

" Her hand went to the fastening at her throat . " Your cloak . " " Return it to me later . " He mounted his horse with loose-limbed grace and lifted his hand to his followers . He was not dressed as they were ; his tight dark blue trousers , intricately tied cravat , and fine coat reminded her of the kind of clothes Papa had worn when he had visitors from England . Yet , curiously , he did not look out of place with these men . She had a sense he possessed that same wildness , but it was controlled , channeled , as theirs was not .

It hurts my heart not to be able to help them . " " That ' little dove ' nearly emasculated me , " Jordan said grimly . " I assure you , she 's far more falcon than dove . " Gregor 's eyes twinkled . " Then you did try to mount her . For shame-and in a holy church too . " " I mounted her , but not in the way you mean . She tried to kill me with an iron candlestick .

" I would not like to have been the officer in charge of the troop who made that mistake . I wonder why he did n't secure Talenka before he marched on to the capital . " " Arrogance . He thought he would wrest the entire country from King Josef and then have all the time in the world to steal the Window to Heaven . It was only when he was defeated that the urgency of the matter hit home . He needed the Window to barter with Napoleon for power and support . " He paused . " However , when they smashed the Window , it seems he tried to rectify the error . He took a troop and rode west to the cottage of Anton Pogani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So everyone thought .

No wonder you 're being so kind to her . " " For God 's sake I 'm not being kind . Have n't you heard anything I 've said ? She wo n't admit it , but she knows the Window to Heaven . She 's been trained in glassmaking , and someday she may be as good a craftsman as her grandmother . It 's a chance , but it 's the only one we have . " " I heard you . " He beamed . " You should not be ashamed of being kind . I know you like the world to think you wicked , but I promise I will tell no one . " " I 'm not- " He stopped and shrugged . " The girl would disagree . She 's already told me she knows I 'm not kind . " Gregor glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go back and get her . What if she flies away ? " Jordan reined in his horse as he turned a corner . " She 's not going to fly away . Because you 're going to go back to the church and stand in that alcove in the shop across the street . Send Niko to watch the back entrance to the garden . Neither of you are to let your presence be known , if she sets out in the direction of the camp . " " And if she does n't ? " " Bring her to me . " Gregor 's expression was troubled . " She thought herself free . You did not tell her the truth . " " I did n't tell her a lie . She is free as long as she makes the right decision . Sometimes it 's necessary to hood a falcon to keep her from flying in the wrong direction . " He added impatiently , " And stop looking at me as if I were going to harm your little bird . The only reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more will be accomplished by offering honey instead of lemon . I 'm well aware I need to coax her into submission . I have no desire to have her claw at me again . " The assurance did n't please Gregor . He had seen Jordan offer honey to women before , share the sweetness , and then withdraw and walk away . " This is not a good thing . She 's not like your usual women . She is wounded . " " You talk as if I was going to bed her , " Jordan said dryly . " As you say , she 's only a child . " " How old ? " " Sixteen . I do n't seduce chits scarcely out of the schoolroom . " It was true Jordan preferred older , experienced women and avoided like the plague the young innocents who were thrown at him both in Kazan and London . Yet Gregor 's instincts told him there had been something unusual in Jordan 's attitude toward the girl a few minutes ago . " The schoolroom from which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jedalar . I think there is little you would not do to get it . " " Then you need n't worry about her for a time . She 's incapable of giving it to me for at least a few years . Perhaps never . " He nudged his horse into a trot . " I 'll see you at camp . " He glanced over his shoulder . " And , Gregor , my friend , while you 're contemplating letting the little dove fly the cage , you might consider that the alternative to my guardianship is leaving her to starve or become a whore in this benighted country . " A convincing argument , Gregor thought gloomily , as he watched Jordan ride away . Jordan was a hard man and had grown even more ruthless since he had involved himself in Kazan 's concerns , but , whatever fate he dealt the girl , it would be better than what she faced here . " Niko ! " He wheeled his horse and gestured to the burly young man at the rear of the troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to be done . " The campfire was burning brightly , a beacon in the darkness , luring her closer . " Marianna ? " Alex 's hand tightened on hers . " Is it all right ? " She did n't know , she thought in sudden panic . She did n't know if they would be safe . She had stayed for hours in the church agonizing over this decision . Draken 's followers appeared a wild band , and yet he was . . . What ? Violent , hard , clever . He had demonstrated all of those traits in the short time they had been together . She had also discerned a relentless determination and a blunt honesty . Yet how could honesty live side by side with deception ? Every instinct said he had not told her the truth about the Window . Alex coughed and pressed closer to her . " I smell food . I 'm hungry , Marianna . " Food and shelter and safety for Alex , Draken had promised her , and she had promised him nothing . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat too great . In the meantime Alex would have a chance to heal and grow stronger . " There will be food soon . " She drew the sheepskin blanket closer about Alex 's shoulders , drew a deep breath , and strode boldly toward the campfire.
