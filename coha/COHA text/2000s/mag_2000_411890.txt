FEW WILL CONSIDER HENRI NOUWEN A LIBERATION theologian in the strict sense of that term . Yet , that is what he was . In reading the quotes from Ed Wojcicki 's article , " Broken yet beloved : What I 've learned from Henri Nouwen " ( April ) , it is very clear that those who were touched by Henri 's deep spirituality became liberated in a very real sense . As a friend of Henri 's for 20 years beginning with my years at Yale , I watched and marveled at the effect he had on the people around him . To be sure he was not , nor did he attempt to be , " holier than thou . " Largely , this was because , as Wojcicki indicated , Henri was in tune with his own moods , depressions , and struggles . The amazing thing about Henri , however , was that when it came to ministry he never let his own frailty get in the way . A person feeling beaten , depressed , lost , and lonely could right before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , a word of consolation , a brief prayer . What he did is exactly what Jesus did-he healed people , he liberated them . I know , because it happened with me and my life was changed forever . Steven E. Berry Los Angeles , Calif . I so much liked Wojcicki 's article because , besides quoting liberally from Henri himself , he finds those of varying backgrounds and involvement with Henri to make his point . Together they give wonderful balance and meaning to Henri 's story . My favorite line in the article is the quote from Wendy Greer : " He gathered people and challenged us to proclaim the truth of our belovedness . " Wojcicki 's personal relationship through his " Open Letters to Henri " is an added bonus . Thank you for the beautiful and inspirational treatment . This is not only Henri 's story , but the story of each one of us . Sue Mosteller Literary executrix of the Henri Nouwen estate Richmond Hill , Ontario , Canada Wojcicki writes of Henri Nouwen like one portrays a friend of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nouwen 's spirituality as well as his passion to share that knowledge with others . He also seems very intrigued by the magnetic field that draws others toward Henri and what exactly it is that touches so many varied souls in his writings . It seems an easy answer but one that is difficult to express . Nouwen had such a deep faith but wrestled constantly with his impulses to please others even when doing so was a serious distraction . This seems true for all of us who are serious about spirituality in today 's arena . Instead of days of neatly wrapped prayers , works , and meditation , most are , at best , clumsily packaged . Barbara Fuhrwerk Springfield , Ill . U.S. CATHOLIC is to be commended not only for including Wojcicki 's finely wrought article , but also a forum for those who want to learn more about Henri Nouwen and his books-the sidebar on Nouwen 's " best " was a great addition to an already terrific article . Linda Cook Davenport , Iowa Right a wrong I thoroughly enjoyed Heidi Schlumpf s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to honor her ( " Who framed Mary Magdalene ? " April ) . The article was thoroughly researched and well-written , and I congratulate Schlumpf . I hope the news about the injustice done to the image of this precious companion to Jesus will one day be rectified . Thanks for doing your part . Janelle Lazzo Roeland Park , Kan . In the editors ' interview with Joyce Rupp , " The art of cultivating spiritual growth " ( April ) , Rupp was asked : " How do you describe yourself ? " To which she responded : " I always ask people to introduce me as a farmer 's daughter . . . because my writing comes out of my roots on the farm . " Cultivating is a farm word . Cultivating is what we used to do to the corn in northwest Iowa in the ' ' 40s , ' SOs , and ' ' 60s . We attached the cultivator to the tractor and moved carefully and precisely through the rows of corn , breaking up the hardened soil , stirring up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled the planted kernel of corn to grow to full maturity and yield a golden harvest . Rupp has been my spiritual director for six or seven years . She has helped me to soften some of my hardness , rid myself of some of my bitterness and resentments , and stir up the deepest part of my being where God/love dwells . The spiritual growth she has cultivated in me is yielding a bountiful harvest of touching , moving , and directing others to a greater intimacy with God , others , and their own real values . This , in turn , makes me truly free to be for others what God has planned . Father Dale George Sioux City , Iowa What a wonderful interview . Whether you call her a writer , retreat guide , spiritual director , or farmer 's daughter , Joyce Rupp is simply very good at what she does , namely , helping ordinary people discover the sacred in their ordinary lives . Although she claims she is not an academic theologian , her writing always flows from a solid , healthy theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious traditions while remaining grounded in her own is a mark of a truly mature and free spirit . Ginny Silvestri St. Clair Shores , Mich . Ban the bomb , now Thank you for the April Sounding Board by Bishop Leroy T. Matthiesen , " Let 's do away with nuclear bombs now , " issuing a strong call for the elimination of nuclear weapons . His words are so needed , as too many people have forgotten about the threat that nuclear weapons pose for our world . And , as he suggests , the church must lead by example by declaring nuclear deterrence as morally unacceptable . In 1998 , on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the peace pastoral , 94 U.S. bishops , including Bishop Matthiesen , took the lead in doing this . They signed a letter , developed by Pax Christi USA , called " The Morality of Nuclear Deterrence : An Evaluation . " They ended their letter saying , " Nuclear deterrence as a national policy must be condemned as morally abhorrent because it is the excuse and justification for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We urge all to join in taking up the challenge to begin the ef fort to eliminate nuclear weapons now , rather than relying on them indefinitely . " Two years later , the call for nuclear abolition is more urgent than ever . Unfortunately , rather than leading the world toward a nuclear-weapons-free 21st century , our own government is instead leading the world in investing in new nuclear-weapons development . Last year the U.S. reaffirmed its reliance on nuclear deterrence at its summit conference with NATO leaders . We must reverse this dangerous trend now . As Bishop Matthiesen suggests , the bishops should seize the moment , and the laity should be right next to them offering support . I invite readers to contact Pax Christi USA to find out how you can get involved . We can be reached at 532 West 8th Street , Erie , PA 16502 ; 814-4354955 ; info@paxchristiusa.org . Nancy Small National Coordinator , Pax Christi USA Erie , Pa . Thank you for publishing Bishop Matthiesen 's beautiful and important article . I am greatly encouraged by his clear gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the weapons remain , they are idolatrous , they take away funds from the starving and the poor , and they prevent us from moving forward toward a culture of nonviolence . If we are to accept Jesus ' Resurrection gift of peace , we need to hear the bishop 's call to disarmament , to join the growing movements for peace and justice , and to keep speaking out until nuclear weapons and war itself are abolished . Father John Dear , S.J. , Executive Director Fellowship of Reconciliation Nyack , N. Y. For our sins . . . Robert J. Batastini 's article " Crucify him ! " ( April ) struck me in two totally different ways . First , I wondered if he wrote his article with tongue in cheek . His statements " I am always myself . I am who I am . . . I do not pretend . . . and I do not shout Crucify him " ' reminded me of " Sam I Am " . . . " and I do not eat green eggs and ham . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three people sing the Passion convinced me that he was pulling our leg . I speak for a lot of people when I say singing the Passion is not a better solution . Second , on a more serious note , I also used to feel the way he does about having to say , yet not mean , the words " Crucify him . " However , over time , I have learned that it is not a bad thing to play the crowd role and to shout , " Crucify him ! " How many times in our daily lives , in our relationship with God , our loved ones , even strangers , have we in effect shouted " Crucify him ! " by our sinful thoughts , words , deeds , and actions , our nonactions , and our failed acts of love ? It can be a humbling and startling experience to hear ourselves shout " Crucify him ! " and realize that we have silently shouted this many times before . Fred R. Tewell Fairfax , Va . Batastini says , " Do n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reading of the Passion in which all the members of the assembly cry out , " Crucify him ! " Batastini contends that he resents having to call for Jesus ' Crucifixion , because he himself would never say that . However , I would point out to Batastini that , except for Mary and Jesus , every human being is a sinner . Whenever we choose to sin , we are wordlessly saying , " Crucify him ! " because " It was our infirmities that he bore , our sufferings that he endured . . . he was pierced for our offenses , crushed for our sins . Upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole , by his stripes we were healed " ( Isa. 53:4-5 ) . Crying out , " Crucify him ! " during the reading of the Passion helps me remember that Jesus died for me . Maria Maddox Elgin , Ill . Please address letters for publication to You May Be Right , 205 W.
