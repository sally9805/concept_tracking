Yes , it 's possible ! Ways to do it-and what to expect , age by age // When he was 2 , my son Drew was charming in his own toddlerish way , although his charm did not often include the phrase " Thank you . " His lack of social graces seemed , to me , perfectly excusable in a shy little boy who clung to my leg . So I was caught by surprise last year when , at 5 , my shy guy became a miniature tyrant , unwilling to sit still at the table , refusing to converse with guests , and demanding " Breakfast now ! " and " Tie my shoes ! " We corrected him , we issued counterdemands , but sadly , we also started to tune out . Then , at my friend Roxanne 's house , he held out his cup and ordered her to refill it , as if he were speaking to a lowly " droid . She turned and flashed me a " You put up with this ? " look . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offspring in The Sound of Music was what I had in mind . But in that moment I knew my efforts had failed . Part of the problem was I did n't know what was reasonable to expect at my son 's age . Well-behaved at school , he usually saved his rudeness for home . Was he tired and cranky ? Restless ? Just being a kid ? by Jane Meredith Adams Photographs by Stephanie Rausser As it turns out , I was tolerating bad manners when I should n't have . After talking to other parents and a few experts , I learned that every child , even a shy , tired , cranky , and defiant one , is capable of age-appropriate good manners . Not perfect manners and not all the time , but a general habit of polite behavior at the table , on the playground , at school , and even when Mom 's on the phone . Good manners show respect and caring ; bad manners hurt people 's feelings . Or , to put it in terms my son would understand : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " It 's never too late to teach your child to be polite , but it 's smart to start early . Age 1 to 2 : Do n't Expect Much ? They can barely walk , talk , or remember anything that happened more than a day ago , but even young toddlers can begin to learn the basics of polite behavior . Just do n't expect them to fully understand-or practice-what you 're teaching them right now . * Make manners part of the conversation . Thinking about other people 's feelings is the root of polite behavior , so encourage your child to do this . Explain that when we help our neighbor hunt for her lost keys in the playground , she feels good and so do we . Point out how kind the cashier is at the supermarket . In fact , talking to young children about caring for others helps them absorb this value without fully understanding it , according to Marvin Berkowitz , Ph.D. , a dad and a professor of character education at the College of Education at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some 15-month-olds are outgoing and wave hello and goodbye to everyone on the block . Others are slower to warm up and may not say hi to a soul , let alone wave . That 's okay . Because of temperament differences , there 's a wide variation in how kids respond to prompting . For a toddler who is n't comfortable being the center of attention at a birthday party , being polite may mean she whispers " Thank you " into your ear and asks you to convey the message . Another option is to have her express thanks by drawing a picture and delivering it . Keep showing your quiet child what being polite looks like : a regular pattern of " Please , " " Thank you , " " Excuse me , " and " I 'm sorry . " * Choose one rule . Throwing food , standing in the high chair , crying : 18-month-olds know how to make mealtime exciting . Their brain development is n't far enough along for them to have the motor or emotional skills for good table etiquette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one rule , such as " When you 're eating , you 're sitting " or " No feet on the table . " Repeat often . 2 to 3 : Civilization Dawns They 're still operating with limited self-control , but as toddlers head toward 36 months , new and stronger brain circuitry helps to improve memory , language , and impulse control . The result : manners appear . * Take action . You ca n't expect your child to have good manners without your help . So if your son has taken another child 's toy at the playground , step in and insist that he return it . Inform him that if he wo n't let go of the toy , there will be a consequence . And do n't imply that he 's the one who gets to make a decision about the toy . " Do n't say Td really like you to think about giving the toy back , ' ' " says Diane Ehrensaft , Ph.D. , a mom of two and the author of Spoiling Childhood : How Well-Meaning Parents Are Giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's asking too much for a child to make that decision . " The fact is , he does n't really have a choice in the matter and has to know he has no choice . Reminding a child of an imaginary character he does n't want to be like can help . When her children were young and refused to say " I 'm sorry , " Ehrensaft says she 'd remind them that they were behaving like Veruca Salt , the rude and self-centered girl in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . " Nobody in their right mind would want to be Veruca , " says Ehrensaft . " So one quick reminder with a warning look was enough to make them stop and think . " * Use rewards . Bill Hennes , gym director at the Rogue Valley School of Gymnastics , in Medford , Oregon , has gotten hundreds of little kids to behave in tumbling class . His secret ? Praise . " My approach is to use positive repetition : " We need to stay in line . Good job . Good job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Patience and persistence are also required . " At home , Hennes uses the same principle at the dinner table . If his kids say " please , " they 're rewarded with what they 've asked for . Tyler , 3 , has the verbal skills to say , " Please may I have more grapes , " Hennes feels , while 2-year-old Josh can get by with " Please more grapes . " * Provide distraction . Sitting through a long dinner is tough for a 2-year-old . Accept that . So to make dinner with friends bearable for him and fun for you , go ahead and give him paper for scribbling or a toy for quiet play . Distractions can also help when you 're on the phone . " When my kids were young , I tried to plan calls for when they were napping , " says Marsha Gerdes , Ph.D. , a mom of two and a pediatric psychologist at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia . " I also kept a basket with crayons , paper , and stickers near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . " But keep calls brief . No 2-year-old can be expected not to interrupt a 20-minute phone call . 3 to 5 : Progress , Not Perfection Preschoolers are starting to master their environment by learning how to dress themselves and put away their toys . New understanding and patience mean taking turns becomes a bit easier , and a steady stream of " why " questions can open the door to serious conversations . Decent manners can start to be a habit . * Use imaginary play . With 3- and 4-year-olds , remembering table manners at , say , a pretend tea party is a fun way to drive politeness lessons home , says Louise Elerding , author of You 've Got Manners ! " With my grandchildren , it 's napkins on the lap , passing to the right , not starting until everyone has a treat , and even introducing guests : " Hello , I 'd like you to meet my friend Bear , ' ' " she says . Enlist the help of your child 's favorite humans and nonhumans by explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Elmo all use proper manners . * Supervise . Sally Larsen , a mom of two and the owner of the kids ' hair salon Cuts for Peanuts in Avon , Connecticut , has seen a lot of bad manners from both kids and parents . While kids twirl salon chairs , steal lollipops from the treat jar , and complain to stylists , too many moms read magazines or zone out . But as your preschooler becomes more mischievous than ever , she needs attention from the manners police-Mom and Dad . If there 's a problem , exert your parental authority . " My attitude is Tm the parent , you 're the kid , and I 'm not negotiating , ' ' " says Larsen , who 's made manners a priority for her two boys , ages 7 and 5 . " It 's not fun , and I guess that 's why a lot of the parents I 've seen in my salon do n't follow through with that kind of enforcement . But we 're not here to be their friends , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids love to show off their manners in the spotlight ; others prefer to stand quietly on the side . And almost every child needs time to get used to a new situation , whether it 's a music class or a playdate . Some will talk , some will nod ; some will say goodbye and thanks with a big hug , others will whisper and flee . 5 to 7 : Manners On Display Kids this age are more able to listen to directions and engage in conversation . At school , they 're being asked to be quiet , take turns , and raise their hands . Manners will help them get along . * Keep talking . As your child 's verbal skills improve , talk about what he considers proper manners . Kids are more likely to follow rules they think they 've invented . Solomon and Celia Goldfarb , ages 8 and 5 , came up with these table manners : " Solomon knows do n't use your spoon as a cannon , and Celia knows do n't say " ewww , yuck " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , publisher of The Six O'clock Scramble , a weekly newsletter of easy recipes . Talk to your child about your expectations and listen to what he says is hard for him to do . Solomon " does n't stay put to savor meals , " says his mom , while his sister stays at the table to enjoy her food but likes to move around while telling stories after she eats . So their mom cuts Solomon some slack and has put a small trampoline in the dining room for Celia. * Maintain boundaries . While it might be tempting to tell your child that it hurt when she said your new dress was gross , do n't muddy the discussion by introducing your emotional life . Instead , keep to what is and is n't acceptable . " It 's better to say " It 's not okay to talk to me that way , ' ' " says Ehrensaft . " Children hunger for-and need-your guidance . " * Accept the hard work . " Unruly kids tend to have parents who 're tired or who 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , " says Hennes , who 's seen lots of parenting styles . A friend of his found she could n't even go grocery shopping with her kids because they 'd run all over the place , he says . " She discovered that being lax was a hard way to be . " Then came the day when the friend was in the supermarket with Hennes , his wife , and their three kids . " She said , " Wow , your kids are perfect , ' ' " he says . " We said " No , it takes a lot of hard work . It 's taken a lot of teaching to get them like this . ' ' " Boy , have I taken these lessons to heart . And the results show . The other morning when Drew said , " Water , please , " in a superfast voice devoid of emotion , I told him that the sentence I wanted to hear was this : " Mom , may I please have a glass of water ? " When he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth time that I speak nicely to him and I expect him to speak nicely to me . It 's good for the family and it 's good for the world , I told him . The next morning , all on his own , he spoke the sentence I wanted to hear . I have hope . Sidebar Share Bear It 's only polite to offer a fuzzy friend the first sip Sidebar 3 Ways to Teach Why Manners Matter Saying " Please " and " Thank you " may be second nature to you , but to a child it can seem like just another no-fun rule . To help kids understand why we use manners , and why they need to be part of their everyday routine : 1 . Use examples you ? child can relate to . Try " If you do n't say please , it sounds like you 're being bossy . " Or " If you do n't say thank you , it will seem like you do n't care that someone gave you something . " 2 . Ask how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded that he 's not the only one who gets his feelings huit . Manners are there to help him , too . When your child forgets to say " please " before using his sister 's crayons , try asking how he 'd feel if she grabbed one of his toys without permission . 3 . Avoid " Because I say so . " This response wo n't help kids learn about caring and respect . To stop rules from seeming arbitrary , explain why the polite way is the best way in a given situation . But remember , you 're not justifying your rule , you 're explaining ityou should expect compliance after you 've clarified why it 's important . - KRISTEN BELLSTROM Sidebar Quiet Grace A whispered " thank you " can be the best manners for a shy child Sidebar Talk to your child about what he considers proper manners .
