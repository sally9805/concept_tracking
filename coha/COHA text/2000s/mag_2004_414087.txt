Seven years ago FORTUNE identified a group of rising African-America n stars on the Street , many of them allied with investment-banking giants . But today it 's the niche players that stand out . By Kimberly L. Allers // Okay , we were wrong . Not in the " Saddam has weapons of mass destruction " kind of way , but we did lay out some expectations that were n't met . Seven years ago FORTUNE identified a new crop of black power brokers on Wall Street . Ambitious , well connected , educated at elite schools , and trained at some of the Street 's top firms , these entrepreneurs seemed to represent a shift in African-American power from political circles to financial ones . Not content to stay in the backwaters of municipal finance , where black firms typically dwelled , they charged into the flashier business of investment banking . We featured people like John Utendahl of Utendahl Capital Partners and Ron Blaylock of Blaylock &; Partners , who forged strategic alliances with major brokerage firms . The group , we wrote , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Wall Street But a look at who 's wielding real power in 2004-based on balance sheets , performance figures , and deal flow-reveals a different outcome . What we expected to be a climb to the upper reaches of the investment-banking world by these players has been more of a slow crawl , with some dashed hopes by the wayside . Instead , among African Americans on the Street , it is those with quantitative expertise or unsexy niche specialties in finance and asset management who have posted the most significant gains . We were indubitably right about one thing . Black power on Wall Street will never be the same . Dreaming big dreams , our group of pioneers shared the determination of the civil-rights generation 's heirs to succeed independently in the mainstream-and to do so in spite of , not because of , their blackness . Their goal was to build companies that were not the best only in comparison with other black-owned firms but simply the best in their field . That is n't going to change . But we were naive , perhaps , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep coffers would be enough to successfully infiltrate America 's largest white-male fraternity-Wall Street . That may sound like an odd statement considering that Merrill Lynch , the biggest firm on Wall Street , has a black CEO , Stan O'Neal . But climbing a corporate hierarchy and starting a business are two different things , and the people we 're concerned with have been trying to do the latter . In fact , there is a new group of African-American entrepreneurs finding success on Wall Street ( more on them in a minute ) , but they are mostly specialists with niche businesses . Success has remained elusive for black-owned firms trying to build full-service brokerages and general equity asset-management businesses . The group we looked at had found a new model : accepting capital and backing from established Wall Street firms as a way to address the historical problem of black-owned firms having limited access to capital . Utendahl was the first . He partnered with Merrill Lynch , his former employer-before O'Neal got the top job there-which ponied up seed money of $3 million and a $9.9 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alliance was supposed to help Utendahl land underwriting roles and give Merrill entry into business allocated to minority firms . Ron Blaylock , who played ball with Patrick Ewing at Georgetown and later became a top trader at Paine Webber , followed suit . In 1993 he set up his own shop with the help of Bear Stearns , which invested $10 million for a 25% stake in the firm . Three years later Blaylock &; Partners became the first minority-owned firm to lead-manage a corporate bond underwriting . Not only was there a new model , but there were new areas of businesses like private equity funds . Fred Terrell left Credit Suisse First Boston , where he had become a managing director after 14 years , to start Provender Capital . Terrell 's firm makes direct investments in companies and multi-unit franchise operations . Currently Provender 's portfolio includes investments in Carver Bancorp , the largest black-owned bank , LeGourmet Chef , a specialty retailer of kitchenware and packaged gourmet foods , and Prestige Brands , which buys unwanted brands from corporate parents , including the purchase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamble . But it was the investment-banking business that was viewed as leading the way . Today some argue that the firms were like handsome facades run by salesmen with limited management skills . " If you painted a lot of these firms white , they would have never been viewed as becoming so successful , " says one black investment banker , who , like many interviewed for this story , requested anonymity . Whatever the reason , black-owned investment banks have n't been able to solidify and maintain their position in one of the most select areas of Wall Street : the lucrative business of underwriting stocks and bonds for large corporations , where fees are a beefy 6% to 7% of the money raised . In some cases early success has turned into a struggle to remain profitable in the sustained market downturn . In 2000 , Utendahl suffered a $6 million loss according to financial statements filed with the SEC , driving the firm into a negative-capital status , an apparent violation of NASD requirements . At the crux of Utendahl 's financial woes was a $12.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sources close to the company say that Merrill forgave the loan to keep Utendahl from closing its doors . ( Utendahl declined to be interviewed for this story . ) In 2001 an unusual clause was buried in the text of one of Utendahl 's underwriting deals . It assured that Deutsche Bank would make up for any deficiency in Utendahl 's capital if necessary . Those words sent up a red flag telling the industry that the firm continued to have capital problems and raising questions about Utendahl 's relationship with Merrill , since it was Deutsche Bank that was stepping in . A Merrill spokesperson says , " We have had a relationship with Utendahl and continue to maintain that relationship today , " declining to comment further . The bruising economy also put Blaylock on the ropes . Its profits plummeted 30% in 2002 . Sources say Bear Stearns grew impatient with its investment and unwilling to sustain further declines . That same year the Rev. Jesse Jackson helped " negotiate " a buyout and cash infusion by the American Insurance Group with a total value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment . After a highly publicized hiring frenzy last year , scooping up well-known analysts laid off from major Wall Street firms , Blay-lock has recently reversed course with massive layoffs and has shut down the brokerage 's Chicago office . ( Blaylock declined to be interviewed for this story . ) So what happened to our class of ' ' 97 ? Politics , race , greed , fear , missed opportunities , and in some cases self-sabotage all contributed to confounding expectations . Specifically , the political climate changed markedly , scandals soured the industry , and when the market went south , the Street 's attitude toward inclusion and its patience for working with small firms went with it . Price also became critical . As small businesses , most of the black-owned firms could n't compete on price because they did n't have the high volume to make it work . The firms also did n't have reserves fattened by the earlier stratospheric rise of stock prices . That boom was led by technology and Internet companies started by nerds in garagesnot the sorts of relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a table that was a feast , " says Harold E. Doley , president of Doley securities and the only black owner of a seat on the New York Stock Exchange . And while larger firms with beefier staffs had the expertise and resources to switch gears and chase the technology craze , black-owned firms were left on the sidelines . So when the market reversed course , the drubbing was severe . For a fuller understanding , rewind to the late ' ' 90s , when political and economic factors created perfect conditions for black firms to thrive . Clinton and the Democrats were in office , and big business wanted to curry favor with Washington by supporting programs and initiatives established or supported by the government . The Resolution Trust-the government 's thrift-bailout agency formed after the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s-dumped $20 billion of mortgage-backed securities on Wall Street , with a government mandate that 15% of it be set aside for minority-owned firms . Not only did this provide an instant business source , it also allowed black-owned firms to develop relationships with large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivating on their own . Their position was further bolstered in January 1997 , when Jackson tossed the fear factor into the mix with the launch of his Wall Street Project , designed to help people of color get a fair shake . Jackson wielded considerable political influence at the time , as he began what he called the " civil-rights movement on Wall Street . " And no company in America wants its name on the wrong side of a Jesse Jackson call-to-action catch phrase . Suddenly black firms had what they 'd never had before-leverage . But as the new millennium dawned , a strong wind of conservatism swept the nation . With Republicans in control of the White House and Congress , the business environment shifted . Jackson began to draw criticism for allegedly strong-arming companies to get black-owned firms included in deals . Jackson defends his actions . " It is not a shakedown , it 's a shake up , " he says . " And as citizens we have the right to participate in nonviolent avenues for change . " The change in political leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how significant Clinton was in fostering opportunities and how damaging the current administration is , " says J. Donald Rice , president of Rice Financial Products . Corporations take their lead from the public sector , and diversifying opportunities in the securities industry was not high on the new administration 's agenda . Later the stock market hit a wall . Profits at the bulge-bracket behemoths slimmed down , with net income at Merrill Lynch plunging 85% in 2001 . Although suffering losses is common , even expected , on Wall Street , it 's a generally accepted fact among black entrepreneurs that their clients become skittish quicker than others . " At the first sign of problems they think you do n't have the resources and capital to survive , so they say , Uh-oh , those doors are going to close , I 'm out of here , " explains one investment banker . With deal flow drying up to a trickle , those companies still doing business were all about closing deals quickly without any hiccups or delays ( remember the Utendahl clause ) . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite , " says Robert Lamb , a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University . But it ca n't all be blamed on the market , George W. Bush , or unfair perceptions . Some of the problems were bad business decisions . Take , for example , the consolidation fever that spread through the banking and brokerage industry as companies saw a need to create scale by combining efforts . By and large the urge to merge never hit the black firms . Why ? " It 's mostly strong egos , " says Lamb and many others who concur , " and a regional bias not to go into areas where they did n't really know anyone . Meanwhile the white firms were playing regional hopscotch all over the place . " Then of course there is the basic driving force of Wall Street-greed-to which black investment bankers were not immune . " Most of them did n't put the capital back into the firm , " says one observer . " It went out the door via jets , expensive vacations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lackluster markets proved particularly harmful to the black-owned firms doing traditional equity management . Many found their clients less willing to ride out the bumps with them . " Black firms have n't been around long enough to prove to the industry that they can survive downturns . The minute your performance numbers or your capital slips , there 's a fear that you wo n't last , and some clients head for the door , " says James Francis , CEO of Paradigm Asset Management . Francis 's own firm lost $2 billion in assets in 1999 , but it has been slowly coming back and now has $950 million . As for the big plan for black asset managers to use minority set-aside allocations to build track records and then break into the mass market-well , it did n't pan out . " It was a deadly trap , " says Quintin Primo , co-chairman of Capri Capital . The set-aside allocations are so minimal that black firms ca n't generate the kind of revenue that would allow them to add research , marketing , and other capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not a business-you 're doomed to failure , " Primo says . If that were n't enough , black Wall Street , as a microcosm of the greater society , had its own share of CEOs behaving badly . Alan Bond , a 40-year-old Harvard Business School alumni and highprofile money manager who was a regular on Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser , is now serving a 12-year sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being convicted on six counts of investment fraud . Through his former firm , Albiond Capital Management , Bond allegedly ran a cherry-picking scheme that allocated profitable trades to his own account and unprofitable trades into client accounts . Bond 's tactic lost his clients $54 million , while his own account coincidentally ballooned an eye-popping 5,000% , to $5.5 million . While he was amassing a warehouse full of exotic cars and a lavish Florida home , Bond was also allegedly receiving $7 million in illegal kickbacks . In March , a superceding indictment was handed down against Nathan Chapman , a personable money manager and president of Chapman Co. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a client of Bond . Chapman , who cut his teeth as the first and only black at Alex . Brown &; Sons , was well connected politically and financially . He was chairman of the University System of Maryland 's Board of Regents , and his company became the first publicly traded black-owned investment bank . Chapman boldly declared that he wanted to be to blacks what the Rothschilds and Morgans were to Europeans and Americans . Instead , jury selection for his trial begins this month . According to Chapman 's indictment , as Bond 's business began to deteriorate under the weight of Bond 's indictment , Chapman " compelled " Bond to buy shares of Chapman 's own firm , eChapman , whose stock price was nearing loose-change levels . But the company did not meet the investment criteria for the pension fund at the time . According to Chapman 's indictment , Bond did as Chapman wished , fearful of losing yet another client , and the state pension system lost $4.7 million . Chapman is also charged with stealing more than $518,000 from his firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various women-none of whom was his wife . The good news is that there are new black winners on Wall Street . Mostly new to us , that is-these companies have been around for years but are in arcane or unflashy businesses that do n't get much media play . The power circle of 2004 is a niche gang . J. Donald Rice stands out among them . His ten-year-old firm , Rice Financial Products , is a specialist in the funky world of derivatives-financial instruments whose value depends on the characteristics of underlying assets or instruments . It 's an industry so esoteric that even seasoned professionals occasionally admit to cluelessness . Not Rice , who earned an engineering degree from Kettering University and an MBA from Harvard Business School . He easily drifts into conversations about floating interest-rate swaps , structured securities , and other minutiae of financial engineering . Rice 's firm helps local governments and municipalities lower their borrowing costs when they sell bonds to raise money . Since opening its doors , Rice Financial Products has completed well over $20 billion in structured financial transactions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own capital on the line , thereby reaping greater profits even in depressed markets . The privately held firm now sits on about $90 million in assets , Rice says . If you think interest-rate swaps are unsexy , what about convertible bonds ? Meet Tracy Maitland , 43 . Back in the go-go ' ' 90s when stocks garnered all the spotlight , Maitland was preaching his gospel of good defensive strategies , the value of convertible bonds , and protecting for the downturn . The former convertible salesman from Merrill Lynch did n't get much love . But his New York firm , Advent Capital Management , continued to land among the top convertible bond and high-yield asset managers , according to the Investor Force database . Over the past two years undying affection , in the form of $2 billion , has poured in from corporations , foundations , and high-net-worth individuals . Now Maitland , a Bronx native and a Columbia University alumnus , sits at the helm of a $3.6 billion asset-management business , which includes a closed-end mutual fund that trades on the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge fund has n't had a down year since its inception in 1996 . And going after minority set-aside business is not part of Maitland 's plan . " There 's 98 cents in the majority bucket , and if you 're lucky , 2 cents to share in the minority bucket , " he says . " You do the math . " Christopher J. Williams , head of Williams Capital Group , uses the new model with a different approach-selling a 20% stake in his company to German banking powerhouse Hypo Vereinsbank , but taking a cue from the retail world with an intensive focus on customer service . The idea of keeping close and quickly responding to the needs of the customer may sound a bit touchy-fecly for the investment-banking world , but Williams makes it work . For the past four years Williams 's company has earned the distinction of being the only black-owned firm to land among the top 20 underwriters on Wall Street , according to Thomson Financial . This month Williams was elected to the board of Wal-Mart . Although Williams , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been consistently profitable through down markets-setting himself apart from the rest of the investment-banking patch . Among asset managers , specialties are also king . Daryl Carter , 48 , and Quintin Primo , 49 , co-chairmen of Capri Capital , built a $7 billion asset-management shop with offices in Chicago , Washington , D.C , San Francisco , and Irvine , Calif. , by focusing on commercial real estate . The two were high school buddies but parted after graduation . Each got an MBA-Carter at MIT , Primo at Harvard . Carter joined Continental Bank , specializing in construction lending and workouts , and later Westinghouse Credit , where he headed the Western commercial real estate division in California . Primo joined Citicorp , now Citigroup , and by the mid-1980s was running its real estate investment-banking operations in the Midwest . Each started his own company , and both were crushed by the collapse of the real estate market . Being broke had a bonding effect , and the two decided to team up . They started a service to advise pension funds on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a discount from financial institutions . After a slow start they later bulked up with acquisitions , buying a mortgage-banking business and an equity-management arm . The company currently has a $5 billion real estate loan portfolio and collects management fees on properties valued at $2 billion . All of these guys have done it right-building well-capitalized companies with proven track records and experience in troubled markets . And while we 'll be watching their progress , we wo n't count out the fallen leaders either . For if one thing is clear , it 's that the black-power movement on Wall Street still is a force that can not be ignored . America 's demographics are changing . Financial institutions are looking to woo the burgeoning middle and upper-middle class of African Americans . In real estate development and finance , urban centers are the final frontier . As Primo puts it , " Suburbia does n't need another mall . " To understand the financial and social dynamics of these areas , black-owned firms will be crucial .
