The day began as any other . <p> Yet for some vague reason , Lady Maura O'Donnell reflected , something seemed different that day . <p> While the curtain of night retreated , dawn began its awakening . Snug in the warm nest of her bed at Castle McDonough , Maura watched as pale pink light hovered as far as the eye could see ; it banished the shadows and deepened to amber and rose , at last spilling across the earth until it poured through the open curtains . <p> Ha ! Whoever said that it rained in Ireland more than anywhere in the world had never lived here , on the northernmost tip of the isle ! <p> Wide-awake now , Lady Maura rose from her bed . It was mid-June , but the mornings carried a chill yet . There was no rug on the floor , so she yanked back her toes at the feel of the cold wood . Jen the housekeeper had seen the once grand carpet beneath the four-poster whisked away while Maura was gone one day . A hazard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , daring Maura to refute it when she yelped at its absence . Maura admitted that Jen was right when the threadbare carpet joined the burn pile and burst into flames thrice her height-why , thrice the height of Jen 's husband Murdoch , truth be told . <p> Papa had promised her another the next time they made the trip to Dublin . <p> Maura had n't reminded him . It was she who kept the books . There were no funds for such extravagances as beautiful , hand-woven carpets . The household staff had grown smaller through the years , as more rooms of the drafty castle were closed off . Now it was only the earl , herself , Murdoch , and Jen who resided in the main section of the castle . Maura 's mother had died before she was six ; she could scarcely remember her . <p> Shivering , she finally braved the cold floor and scampered toward the washstand . A floorboard creaked . She paused and glanced down , only to stub a toe on the edge of the next . Stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long , pitted plank . As she washed her face , then combed her hair and tied it back with a length of ribbon , she decided she would have to call Patrick the Woolly in to fix it before she fell flat on her face . Her father had always claimed that Patrick the Woolly-not a soul in the valley called him otherwise-was the best carpenter in County Donegal . And he was , provided one used his services early in the day , before he 'd had a pint too many . And if she did not have it fixed posthaste , her father would be wondering if she herself had imbibed with Patrick the Woolly . <p> A wistful sigh escaped . How dearly she wished there were funds to see the castle restored to its former glory . Oh , how Papa would beam ... But she knew it would never be so . Little by little it had become necessary to begin selling off items of value . They were not destitute , not yet , but she feared that someday it might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . She had to believe that better days were ahead . <p> Elsewhere in the castle , the morning ritual had begun as well . Maura heard her father 's boots cross the floor in his room at the end of the hall . Slipping into her petticoats and gown , she heard Murdoch 's heavy footfalls on the stairs . More creaks there than she could count , she decided . <p> A heavy door opened , then closed . Another creak . Maura stifled a sigh and turned . As always , Jen 's timing was impeccable . <p> The shorter woman gave a curtsy , as much as her portly form would allow . " Good morning to you , milady . " <p> " Milady ? What ? " Maura teased . " What misdeed have I done that I have lost your good graces ? " <p> The older woman shook her head . It was a long moment before she lifted her head . Maura stared . Her eyes seemed overly bright . Was she ... <p> " Jen . Jen , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands and pulled her into her room . " Jen , tell me ! What 's wrong ? " <p> " Nothing is wrong . " Jen spoke strongly , then her tone wavered . " It 's just that-well , you are a lady , Maura , a most beautiful one at that . " <p> Maura was still stunned , taken aback at the tears Jen could n't quite hide , the unsteadiness of her tone that she could n't control . She scoured her mind but could n't recall ever seeing Jen cry before . Not even when both her sons had left for America , and she and Murdoch knew they 'd likely never see them again . <p> " Jen , " she whispered , and all at once there was a huge lump in her throat . <p> " You 've grown up before I even knew it . And I-I thought you should know . I oft tend to see you as a child . But you 're a lady , " Jen said again . " So much a lady and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maura , some dashingly handsome young man will appear and take you away as his bride . I 'll miss you , Maura . I 'll miss you so . " Trying desperately to smile , she smoothed one velvety black curl that lay on Maura 's shoulder . <p> Touched beyond words , Maura reached out , wrapped her arms around Jen 's sturdy form and hugged her tight . After the death of her mother , her father had never remarried , and Jen , the woman who raised her , was the only motherly figure she 'd ever known . She had comforted her , tended her scrapes-and oh , there were many ! - and scolded her soundly when she was into mischief . Why , both Jen and Murdoch had done so . They were more than servants . Much more . <p> They were her family , as much as her father . <p> For a long time they stood that way , clinging to each other . In the back of Maura 's mind was that same sensation as when she woke ... that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continues ... ) <p>
