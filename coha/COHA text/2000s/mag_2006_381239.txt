The young Theodore Roosevelt did not strike most people as promising enough to become one of the nation 's greatest Presidents . His august Knickerbocker family had grown rich from generations of shrewd investments in real estate , banking , glass importing and even hardware . But in his youth  --  and for that matter in his adulthood  --  T.R. showed very little interest in adding to the family fortune . When Roosevelt was a toddler , his asthma began to overshadow everything he did . As he grew , Theodore was too " delicate " for school  --  until Harvard he was educated at home  --  and too weak to stand up to other boys . On doctor 's orders his father Theodore Sr.  --  called Thee by everyone in the family  --  and his mother Martha , called Mittie , rushed him to seashore resorts one day and mountain cabins the next in search of air to help him breathe . The sickly boy seemed unlikely to survive into manhood or amount to much if he did . <P> But Roosevelt 's childhood weakness would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became . At about the time Theodore reached the end of boyhood , Thee , whom young T.R. adored , set off a crisis in their relationship . He insisted on making his favorite child into a strong man by directing him to embrace a life of vigorous exercise . He told him with characteristic sternness to throw off his invalidism by force of will . He ordered the boy to " make your own body . " According to Theodore 's sister , Theodore " resolved to make himself strong , " to turn his back on his " nervous and timid " childhood and embrace manhood . The cure would come by way of sports and outdoor activity , mountains to be climbed and harsh weather to be endured . <P> From that day forward , T.R. became a fierce champion of what he called the " strenuous life , " a self-imposed struggle to live with vigor and determination . He boxed and pulled at weight machines , and his chest expanded along with his capacity to breathe . To conquer his fragility he began , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and even dangerous thing . " Years later , T.R. wrote in his autobiography that his life changed forever because he set fearlessness before him " as an ideal " that by dogged practice he achieved . Advised that he had a bad heart and should n't climb stairs , the 22-year-old T.R. ascended the Matterhorn . <P> His self-making had costs . Throughout his life he repeatedly injured himself , even sustaining a boxing injury when he was 45 that on top of a cataract cost him the sight in his left eye . Obsessively seeking strength through exercise and adventure , he developed an equally overdone hatred for sissies , " cripples and consumptives , " for anyone who could not measure up physically or who reminded him of his childhood shortcomings . He even told his sons he 'd rather see them dead than have them grow up to be weaklings . He could never admit to frailty in himself . That was one reason his charge up Kettle Hill in the Battle of San Juan Heights with the Rough Riders , the volunteer cavalry unit he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so important to him . It proved to the world  --  and himself  --  that Roosevelt , a man who could talk very admiringly about war , had the strength and courage to fight in one . Although all his life , even when he was President , he continued to suffer on occasion from asthma he did not want the public to know of his illnesses . It did n't fit his self-image.
