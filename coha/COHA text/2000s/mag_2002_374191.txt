Maryann Martin presides over America 's smallest tribe . Raised in Los Angeles in an African-American family , she knew little of her Indian ancestry until 1986 , when at age 22 she learned that her mother had been the last surviving member of the Augustine Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians . In 1991 , the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) certified Martin and her two younger brothers as members of the tribe . Federal recognition of tribal status opened the door for Martin and her siblings to qualify for certain types of government aid . And with it , a far more lucrative lure beckoned : the right to operate casinos on an Indian reservation . <P> As Indian casinos popped up like new housing developments across Southern California , Martin moved a trailer onto the long-abandoned Augustine reservation in Coachella , a 500-acre desert tract then littered with garbage , discarded household appliances and junk cars , about 25 miles southeast of Palm Springs . There she lived with her three children and African-American husband William Ray Vance . In 1994 , membership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin 's two brothers were killed during separate street shootings in Banning , Calif . Police said both men were involved in drug deals and were members of a violent Los Angeles street gang . <P> Subsequently , Martin negotiated a deal with Paragon Gaming , a Las Vegas company , to develop and manage a casino . Paragon is headed by Diana Bennett , a gaming executive and daughter of Vegas veteran and co-founder of the Circus Circus Casino William Bennett . Martin 's Augustine Casino opened last July . With 349 slot machines and 10 gaming tables , it 's the fifth and by far the most modest casino in the Palm Springs area . But it stands to make a lot of non-Indian investors  --  and one Indian adult  --  rich . <P> And get this : Martin still qualifies for federal aid , in amounts far greater than what many needy Native Americans could even dream of getting . In 1999 and 2000 alone , government audit reports show , she pulled in more than $1 million from Washington  --  $476,000 for housing , $400,000 for tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't supposed to be this way . At the end of the 1980s , in a frenzy of cost cutting and privatization , Washington perceived gaming on reservations as a cheap way to wean tribes from government handouts , encourage economic development and promote tribal self-sufficiency . After policy initiatives by the Reagan Administration and two U.S. Supreme Court rulings that approved gambling on Indian reservations , Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 . It was so riddled with loopholes , so poorly written , so discriminatory and subject to such conflicting interpretations that 14 years later , armies of high-priced lawyers are still debating the definition of a slot machine .
