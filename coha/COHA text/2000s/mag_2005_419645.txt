An assassin bug 's sensory journey // In rural areas of Latin America , adobe houses with thatched roofs are fixtures of the landscape . The houses are crisscrossed by crevices that serve as hideouts for insects . In the evenings , as the sun goes down , masses of intertwined heads , legs , and antennae start to disentangle . One by one , the insects come out and start their nightly search for blood . They are called kissing bugs or assassin bugs in English , but in Latin America they have many regional names . In my home country of Argentina , we call them vinchucas , a word derived from Quechua ( a family of languages dating back to the Incan Empire ) , which means " those who let themselves fall . " These insects are bloodsuckers , and when searching for a blood meal they honor their Quechuan name : because they are such bad fliers , they let themselves drop from walls and ceilings . Once on the floor , or while crawling down the walls , the insects skillfully navigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they encounter . When a vinchuca finds a host-a dog , say , or a sleeping human-it swifdy locates a blood vessel . Next , it extends its proboscis , a beak neatly folded under its head , and pierces the skin of its victim . As it feeds , the bug injects a cocktail of analgesics , anticoagulants , and vasodilators that help the blood flow smoothly and painlessly . Slowly , the vinchuca grows , as Charles Darwin described with disgust after being attacked by one in Argentina , from " flat as a wafer to a globular form , " as it becomes " bloated with blood . " While still feeding , the in sect releases urine and feces on the skin of the host , making room in its abdomen for the enormous amount of incoming blood . See photographs on page 34 . The vinchuca 's excretions can harbor a protozoan known as Trypanosoma cruzi-the cause of Chagas ' disease . The T. cruzi parasites come , in turn , from another animal , and get sucked up when the insect feeds on that infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vector , for T. cruzi . When a healthy bite victim scratches at a vinchuca wound , any T. cruzi parasites in the droppings can slide inside the victim 's open skin , and eventually move through the bloodstream to colonize heart muscle and other body tissues . Symptoms of Chagas ' disease vary dramatically , particularly in the early stages . Some people never develop side effects , whereas others experience fever , rashes , and fatigue a few weeks after being bitten . About a quarter of the infected population suffer from serious heart or digestive disorders , which only develop decades after the initial infection . Of the some 20 million people in Latin America now infected with T. cruzi , about 50,000 die every year . Those figures make Chagas ' disease one of the most widespread and economically devastating tropical diseases in the world . And for poor countries , in which substandard housing is widespread , the total economic loss due to Chagas ' disease is staggering . Vinchucas are relatively unknown in big cities , simply because urban housing does not offer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not encounter a vinchuca until I became a graduate student in the Laboratory of Insect Physiology , at the University of Buenos Aires . There I was part of a team trying to answer some of the many outstanding questions about vinchucas . As my colleagues and I immersed ourselves in the study of the insect and pooled our results , we were able to reconstruct the insect 's sensory trip from its refuge to its host . In common usage , the term " vinchuca " can refer to many species . We concentrated on one , Triatoma infestons , which thrives in the arid north of Argentina and lives almost exclusively in human dwellings . When we started our research , the behavior of T. infestons was not well understood . The director of our laboratory , Claudio R. Lazzari , had surveyed the species ' behaviors during his own graduate work , with the insect physiologist Josu A. Nunez , also of the University of Buenos Aires . From Lazzari , Nez , and a few other insect physiologists , we knew that T. infestans could home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch-dark room . But we did not know how it accomplished the task . Odors , chemicals , and heat all clearly played a role , but we were clueless about exactly how the insects exploited that information . So we divvied up the various aspects of the vinchucas ' biology and behavior among the members of our team . I focused on the thermal sense-to me , the most fascinating sense of all . By day , the vinchuca remains in a sleeplike state known as akinesis . At dusk , however , the insect is activated by an internal biological clock , which regulates most of its behaviors . The newly awakened vinchuca raises its antennae-its sensing instruments-and , usually , grooms them : a mesmerizing process . Standing steady on its four rear legs , the in sect lifts both front legs and unhurriedly draws first one antenna , then the other , through small combs on the inner sides of the two front legs . Now it is ready to go . As the last hints of daylight disappear , the insect starts randomly walking , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every so often , though , the insect pauses , and the smooth , sweeping antenna movements become jerky , resembling the old semaphore method of flag signaling . The vinchuca is sampling the air . The vinchuca 's antennae are remarkable structures . Less than a third of an inch long in adults and even shorter in the larvae , the antenna is the seat of thousands of so-called sensilla , the insect 's sense organs see illustration on opposite page . Each sensillum is a sensory unit made up of one or more neurons , plus supporting cells that nourish them . The sensilla endow the insect with senses of heat , smell , and touch . Taken together , the antennae and their sensilla are the insect 's window on the external world . The wandering vinchuca , antennae waving , has entered an odor plume . Mists of molecules bump into the insect . Some of the molecules penetrate the insect 's cuticle through minute pores and reach the olfactory sensilla just beneath . Warmblooded animals are an endless source of odors , and their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the best indicators that a good source of blood is nearby is a gas that , to us , is odorless : carbon dioxide . Most blood-sucking insects , including mosquitoes and vinchucas , however , can smell carbon dioxide , and they rely on that cue in their search for a host . My colleagues discovered that an internal clock controls the sensitivity of vinchucas to carbon dioxide . It turns out that the insect 's sensitivity is highest in the first hours of the night , at the start of their journey . Vinchucas have olfactory receptors for dozens of other scent molecules as well as for carbon dioxide . Upon detecting a promising odor , the vinchuca adopts a new tactic : it travels " upwind , " against any local currents of air , to get closer to the source . As it follows the current , the insect gauges its direction with motion-sensitive hairs , known as mechanoreceptors , which are abundant on the antennae . In a new state of alert , the vinchuca closes in on its intended host , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all the vinchuca 's sensitivity to smell and touch , heat is the ultimate stimulus that prompts it to bite . We devised a way to demonstrate that behavior in the laboratory . We heated a piece of metal to the surface temperature of a warm-blooded animalabout ninety degrees Fahrenheit ( thirty-two degrees Celsius ) - and brought the metal within range of a vinchuca 's proboscis . Immediately the vinchuca extended its proboscis and repeatedly tried to bite the metal . Furthermore , when we cooled the metal to below ninety degrees Fahrenheit , no other stimulus we presented could induce the vinchuca to extend its proboscis . Even if the insect had n't eaten for forty days , we could not get it to bite a cool surface . My colleagues were able to come up with only one way to circumvent the vinchuca 's virtually automatic response . They placed a miniature copper rod , warmed to the temperature of a warm-blooded animal , near the vinchucas ' antennae , and tricked the insects into drinking cold blood . It is hard to imagine a clearer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects ' feeding routine . Odors from a potential host initially attract vinchucas , but heat is the only stimulus both necessary and sufficient to get them to bite . A current of warm air has now reached the insect 's sweeping antennae . As the thermal sensilla absorb the heat , they warm up . Vinchucas , like most animals , can detect heat through conduction or through rising air currents . Amazingly , though , the insects can also sense radiant heat-known as infrared radiation . Lazzari and Nnez discovered that capability when they placed windows , impenetrable to infrared radiation , between the insects and a source of heat-which was , again , a miniature metal rod at the right temperature . All the vinchucas ' usual responses to heat disappeared , but were duly restored when the experimenters replaced the infrared-opaque window with a window transparent to infrared rays . The insects could detect temperature changes as small as 0.0072 degree F ( 0.004 degree C ) - which makes them among the most thermally sensitive animals known . Only a few other animal species are known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vipers , pythons , and the jewel beetle ( Melanophila acuminata ) - an insect able to detect forest fires from nearly fifty miles away . Vinchucas are also unusual in that their antenna carry a kind of sensillurri observed in only a few other blood-sucking insects : the " cave organ . " Since its discovery in the 1950s , the function of the organ has been a mystery . It is a pit ( hence its name ) lined with hundreds of thin , short hairs that have no pores . Each antenna , moreover , has only one cave organ , in sharp contrast with other kinds of sensilla that number in the hundreds . Lazzari showed that the cave organ responds to heat but not to odors , and suggested that it might be acting as an infrared receptor . But there is still no clear-cut evidence supporting the hypothesis . Studying the vinchuca 's response to heat requires a love for the minuscule-and good craftsmanship as well . In our laboratory , everyone created the tools he or she needed . That rule was mainly driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . But it also stemmed from a tradition in entomology , inherited from such early investigators as the English entomologist Vincent B. Wigglesworth . Wigglesworth began his studies on another vinchuca vector of Chagas ' disease , Rhodnius prolixus , in the 1920s , and became the first to study its response to heat . He soon encountered a problem that many others have faced as well : As an insect walks , the amount of heat reaching it constantly changes . How , then , can the experimenter maintain a constant distance between the insect and the heat source , and thereby control for the heat reaching the insect , without stopping the insect from walking ? The problem was ingeniously solved more than half a century ago . The German behavioral biologists Bernhard Hassenstein and Werner Reichardt devised the celebrated-in the world of **27;1715;TOOLONG . The device is essentially a miniature tetrahedron that has been " inflated " into a more nearly spherical shape about three quarters of an inch in diameter . The tetrahedral framework is made of a light material such as balsa wood or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insect , in turn , is glued to a rod that suspends the insect directly beneath a fixed frame . Because the spangenglobus weighs about the same as the insect does , the insect can grab the spangenglobus with its legs and walk , just as if it were walking upside down and gripping a ceiling with enough force to support its own weight . To the insect , then , holding on to the surface of the spangenglobus as it walks is indistinguishable from walking upside down on a solid surface . Like Lewis Carroll 's Red Queen , the insect walks and walks , only to stay in the same place . The tetrahedral shape also has a clever purpose . Because three edges come together at each vertex , whenever the insect walks up to a vertex , it faces a choice of two ways to proceed , left or right . If the experimenter presents a stimulus on the right different from that on the left , and notes which way the insect turns , the animal 's behaviors can be studied in detail . I inherited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guarded the little treasures with zeal and kept them together with ten custom-made acrylic boxes , ten diminutive copper pincers , a miniature brush made of my own hair , and a few solid aluminum plates that served as heat sources . With this basic homemade tool kit I studied the vinchucas ' responses to heat . We later acquired more sophisticated gadgets , but the first experiments , the ones conducted with the most primitive tools , were by far the most interesting . With the spangenglobus , Lazzari had tested the behavior of blinded vinchucas-their eyes had been covered over with paint-when he confronted them with pairs of metal plates at different temperatures . He found that the insects walked toward temperatures close to that of a warm-blooded animal , away from plates that were hotter , and were unaffected by the ones at room temperature . This result might seem obvious , but it is not . It has an important implication : the insects can estimate the temperature of a distant object . Furthermore , in Lazzari 's experiments the vinchucas never raised their proboscises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they " knew " it was n't close enough , even though their eyes were covered . In another experiment , this time with unrestrained , freely walking-but still blind-vinchucas , I observed that once the insects reached the heat source , they repeatedly tried to bite and pierce the metal ; they all extended their proboscises when they were about half an inch from the source , even though they could not see it . Did that imply that they could estimate distance as well as temperature ? Abundant evidence suggested they could ; it was time to ask how . To answer that question , think about what happens to the thermal sensilla . When confronted with a heat source , the sensilla receive a given amount of heat , which fires neurons . But that information , by itself , is not enough to discriminate sources at different temperatures , because a distant-or small-hot source could produce the same local warming as a closer-or larger-cool source . Thermal sensilla alone can not distinguish those two conditions , but vinchucas certainly can . The insects might be recognizing two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " computing " a third characteristic , its actual surface temperature . Vinchucas could gauge distance-we had ample evidence of that . But I was determined to find out about their ability to discern size . If they could estimate the first two of these variables , then , given the basic physical and geometric circumstances , maybe they could " calculate " the third . The antenna movements of a walking vinchuca , which I knew in great detail , gave me an idea . Confronted with a warm source-or with the hand of the experimenter , for that matter-a vinchuca walks toward the potential blood meal , opening and closing its antenna . Perhaps those antenna movements , which expose the thermal receptors to the heat source , were also enabling the vinchuca to estimate the size of the source . I devised two tests for my hypothesis . In the first , I put heat sources of various size at a fixed distance from the insect ; in the second , I put a single heat source at various distances see illustration on opposite page . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they reacted to heat , and digitized the positions of the antennae every second . From the filmed positions I determined the angles between the antennae and compared them from test to test . To my amazement , I found that the antenna aperture changed with both the size of the source and the distance between the source and the insect . When I plotted the angular values , it became clear that the position of the antennae simply , and consistently , followed the apparent size of the source from the insect 's point of view-regardless of the actual size or distance of the source . In other words , when two plates subtended the same angle-one big and far away , the other small and nearby-the antennae also made the same angle with each other . The pieces of the thermal puzzle were beginning to fall into place : the variable of size might be accounted for . Let 's go back to the vinchuca once more and reconstruct the last part of its journey . The insect , attracted to a host by its smell , enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heat through thermal receptors , it turns and faces the source of heat . Scanning the air , it follows the edges of the heat source with its antennae , whose position is being closely monitored by mechanoreceptor hairs . These hairs bend when the antennae move , and report the antenna position to processing centers in the brain . The insect thus estimates the apparent area , or size , of the heat source . The amount of heat from a given source increases as the vinchuca gets closer to that source , but the increase is not proportional to the distance . Instead the heat is inversely proportional to the square of the distance . If the vinchuca walks to within half its initial distance from the heat source , the in sect gets four times as much heat as it got at first ; if it takes a few more steps , to a quarter of its initial distance , the heat increases to sixteen times its initial level . We think such rapid changes in heat play a key role for the insect in determining its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a vinchuca might measure the amount of heat received in two different parts of its body , say , the head and the rear end . By comparing the amount of heat received at those two points , it could estimate the distance to the heat source and thus assign a value to the second variable . Knowing the area and the distance , the vinchuca could " derive " the third , and crucial , variable : the actual temperature of the heat source . If it fell in the known range of temperatures of a warm-blooded animal , the vinchuca might as well try for a meal . Thus ends a bug 's trip from its refuge to a host , a trip aided by amazing sensory instruments . It is a journey repeated endlessly by millions of vinchucas every evening , across Latin America . In spite of the vinchuca 's superior homing skills , this journey would not be possible without a proper refuge during the day . And yet , in many countries , the straightforward approach of improving housing conditions-filling in nooks and crannies-remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free reign on their nightly forays . Sidebar Vinchucas spend their days crowded together in refuges such as the cracks of adobe houses in rural areas . The interior of one such house is shown pressionistically on these two pages . At dusk , the internal docks of the vinchucas set the insects on their nightly search for a blood meal . Sidebar Vinchuca ( Rhodnius prolixus ) , the species first studied in the 1920s for its response to heat , feeds on a human host . The insect starts out " thin as a wafer , " as Charles Darwin noted , left , but balloons in size and empties its bowels as it fills with blood , right . Sidebar Thousands of sensilla cover the vinchuca 's antennae ; mechanoreceptors ( a ) give the insect a sense of " touch ; " thermoreceptors ( b ) respond to heat ; chemoreceptors ( c ) bind to scent molecules ; and the solitary cave organ ( d ) - one per antenna-may help the insect detect infrared radiation . Sidebar Experimental apparatus for testing a vinchuca 's responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stand and allowed to walk in place , while it held on to a rounded , tetrahedral Styrofoam object called a spangenglobus . Warm metal plates of equal size and temperature were placed at various distances ( A , B , C ) , and smaller plates , subtending the same angles as the plates at distances B and C , were placed at distance A ( pink and yellow rectangles ) . The insect spread or closed its antennae as the plates varied in distance or size , just as if it were " measuring " the angle of each plate from its point of view . Thus , with an independent estimate of distance , the vinchuca could also estimate the true size of its potential host . Sidebar Spreading their antennae helps vinchucas estimate the size of a host .
