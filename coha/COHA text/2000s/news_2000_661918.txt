Now that the presidential election is finally resolved , it 's not too early to wonder whether technology could save us from another debacle the next time around . <p> After all , college entrance exams and tax returns can all be done electronically . So why not voting ? <p> In Brazil , voters have cast ballots on computers for five years . Arizona Democrats conducted their presidential primary online this year , and watched turnout soar . <p> So you 'd think we 'd be able to quickly replace the antiquated voting systems that gave us dimpled chads and butterfly ballots . Think again . <p> Unfortunately , barriers mostly political and financial are likely to keep any kind of widespread electronic voting out of the electoral process for years . <p> " Even with this election it will take a while to move to reform , " said Jeremy Sharrard , an analyst at Forrester Research in Boston . " It speeds up the discussion which speeds up reform , but it is a frustratingly slow process . " <p> Already , computers are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida election . Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y , and Sen. Sam Brownback , R-Kan. , have introduced a bill that would offer as much as $250 million to help states modernize their election systems . <p> But as the Florida imbroglio showed , decisions about voting systems are made at the county level , where money for expensive changes is often hard to come by and power over elections is guarded closely . <p> If and when computers do play a role in voting , most experts in security and elections agree it will be at polling sites rather than over the Internet - despite the alluring ease of being able to cast your vote from home in your pajamas or at work during a coffee break . <p> In Brazil , where Election Day is a national holiday and voting is compulsory , citizens use touch-screen computers and machines outfitted with keyboards to cast ballots in precincts . <p> The votes are recorded on disks , backed up with paper printouts , and transmitted over dedicated network lines to a central counting site once polls close , explained Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who helped design the first phase of the Brazil system . <p> Transmitting vote totals in such a way is considered extremely secure because the network is not connected to the Internet . It handles only the voting data , which is encrypted so as to be tamperproof and readable only by the central computer doing the counting . <p> " A seemingly backward country has leapfrogged past us again , " said Ekholm , who lives in Palm Beach County , Fla. , ground zero in Election 2000 . <p> About 10 percent of American voters cast ballots on an electronic machine in November , according to The Election Center , a Texas-based training organization for election officials . <p> Most places favor touch-screen computers because they are easy even for people completely unfamiliar with technology . <p> In the U.S. systems , votes are recorded on disks that are later transferred to a central counting system . <p> No state has approved a system that uses networked computers or phone lines to transmit election results as in Brazil , though the Federal Election Commission is considering standards for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties - Sacramento , Contra Costa , San Mateo and San Diego - held unofficial demonstrations in which networked computers were set up at county election offices and votes were sent using the Internet to a central server for tabulation . <p> About 2,000 test ballots were cast , and hackers were challenged to disrupt the system . <p> No breaches were reported - though security experts say such experiments are misleading , because hackers are unlikely to tip their hands too early by showing they can disrupt a test . <p> Though transferring results on disks , rather than over a network , slows down the counting process , it is still faster than traditional paper ballot tabulation . And better yet , there is no subjectivity , no partially poked holes or pregnant chads . <p> Last year , Fairfax County , Va. , which has 810 touch-screen voting computers , needed a recount in a state Senate race in which one candidate led by 32 votes out of 32,000 cast . Officials merely checked the votes on printouts generated by the voting computers . <p> After the four-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both on paper absentee ballots . <p> " This would certainly reduce the number of recounts , " said Brad Clark , registrar of voters in Alameda County , one of seven California counties that uses touch-screen machines . " It counts what it counts . " <p> The problem with the touch-screen computers is their cost - about $3,500 to $5,000 each . Sophisticated options , like programming several languages for voters who do n't speak English , could elevate the cost to $10,000 . <p> Computerizing Los Angeles County 's 5,000-precinct election system could thus carry a hefty pricetag of more than $200 million , said Doug Lewis , executive director of The Election Center . <p> Smaller governments would have to pay far less , but probably would have a tougher time affording the upgrade . <p> In Mercer County , Pa. , which has 120,000 people , a computerized system would cost about $1 million . <p> " We have voting machines that are so old they do n't make parts for them anymore . We fix some with duct tape and twine , " said County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system gets pushed to the back when you have other things to pay for . " <p> Although the distaste over what happened in Florida has led state and federal legislators to propose funding for an election overhaul , many county governments likely would oppose new standards that would come along with that , said Gordon Bowen , political science professor at Mary Baldwin College in Staunton , Va . <p> " To mandate a new system would be very difficult because they are running up against years and years of local tradition , " Bowen said . " Behind closed doors I think you would hear the politicians say they would get their ox gored for trying . " <p> Voting over the Internet , with the same mouse-clicking ease that allows consumers to buy everything from yachts to Yahtzee , has been tried in only two official elections : Arizona 's Democratic primary in March and a Defense Department pilot program with 200 overseas Americans in November . The Pentagon is expected to evaluate its project next month . <p> Arizona Democrats hired Election.com , an online election company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary . <p> More than 86,000 Democrats cast ballots , 80 percent via Election.com , up from 13,000 in 1996 . Officials said the highest turnout increase was in Hispanic and American Indian neighborhoods . <p> However , the Voting Integrity Project , a nonpartisan voters ' rights group , is suing the Arizona Democratic Party , claiming the election discriminated against poor people without Internet access . <p> Bob Taylor , an Election.com vice president , argues that Internet voting is safe for several reasons . For one , an intrusion system verifies that no hacker is trying to pose as the election Web site . <p> Taylor also believes the system is not subject to attack by a computer virus . And corrupting the votes while they are transmitted to a central server would also be nearly impossible , he said . <p> " This system is n't up very long , only that day , so not only would you have to know how to ( hack ) it , you would have to do it in a very short amount of time , " Taylor said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who advises federal election officials on Internet voting , said Web sites are too easily corrupted , copied or brought down . An attack spread by a virus could change a vote without the voter 's knowledge . <p> " Unless you are extremely Internet-savvy and you bother to check those things , you will never know , " Jefferson said . <p> Several logistical problems also stand in the way , including how to verify a voter 's identity over a home computer . Supporters of Internet elections suggest passwords and identification codes could be mailed to voters . <p> " The problem is that the password and ID are only as secure as the mail and only as good as you can prove that people are n't selling those passwords , " explained Bob Weiss , owner of Password Crackers , a Maryland-based company that helps people who have lost or forgotten their passwords . <p> To many people , just about any change at all would be a good start . <p> " After this election I 'm sure we will have to move in some direction pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Roberta Jensen , 72 , of Sun City , Ariz. , who voted in the online primary . " I do n't think there is a man alive after this that still likes his punch-card ballot .
