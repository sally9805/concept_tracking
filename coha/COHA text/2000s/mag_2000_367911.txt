There 's a little something of Bob Hope in Dr. Sid . Specifically , it 's the liver spots on Sid 's cueball forehead and the thick blue vein down the side of his temple . The tufts of white hair around the back were inspired by photos of Sean Connery , among many others , while the sixtysomething scientist 's aged pores and wrinkles have been drawn from thousands of images of lesser-known maturing gentlemen . Donald Sutherland got away lightly ; all he had to provide was Sid 's voice . <P> Sid is an animated composite , a digital cartoon . Just keep telling yourself that when you stare into his disturbing photorealistic visage at the multiplex next summer . And he 's only one of a complete cast of computer-generated actors in Final Fantasy , a Columbia Pictures feature with a rumored budget of $70 million , based loosely on the multimillion-selling series of PlayStation games of the same title . A science-fiction epic that deals with earth 's response to alien invasion in 2065 , Fantasy looks to be the first movie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pixar did for toys and bugs : build living , breathing replicas out of electrons . <P> That 's no small proposition . Lifelike skin and hair are notoriously tough to manage on computers ; even Spielberg once said he 'd never attempt to create CG humans . Now about 200 animators and artists , some of whom have been at it for more than two years , are laboring in near secrecy under creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi . Veterans of Titanic and The Matrix have been drafted alongside video-game gurus from Japan . <P> Walk through Fantasy 's four floors of office space in downtown Honolulu  --  a city chosen for its almost equidistance between Hollywood and Tokyo  --  and you 'll see sleep-deprived animators getting strands of our heroine Aki 's hair to waft just so , or watching endless video loops of voice talents James Woods , Alec Baldwin , Ming-Na and Ving Rhames trying to make their characters ' lips move in exactly the same way . <P> No detail is too small to be left to the imagination ; no time-consuming trick is spared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ping-Pong balls all over their bodies run around in a circle of red-lit cameras . The cameras bounce signals off the balls and create a framework for the computer to replicate their bodies . This is called motion capture , and it tends to be used sparingly in video games to clone , say , the slam-dunk moves of an NBA player . In Fantasy , it 's used for each one of the movie 's estimated 1,500 shots in which any of its hundreds of characters move their body . <P> The end result of all this jiggery-pokery ? It 's not quite indistinguishable from reality  --  as with the dinosaurs and toys , there 's a little too much artful puppetry in the actors ' facial movements . And as the animators admit , CG lighting is still too harsh , too unnatural to reflect properly in eyes and on skin . But these are nitpicks . Fantasy is n't that far off the real thing . It 's close enough to make you believe that in a couple more decades , our screens will be stuffed with synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer feel blatantly computer generated , " says Sakaguchi . " If we press on , we can achieve the reality level of a live-action film , but I kind of like where we are now . It 's not anime ; it 's not live action . It 's something people have never seen before . "
