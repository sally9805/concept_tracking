TWO BOYS BRIDGE THE COMMUNICATION GAP IN A PUZZLING SORT OF WAY . HOW ABOUT YOU ? CAN YOU SOLVE THESE CRYPTOGRAMS ? // During the last week before summer break , Philippe 's school held an Academic Olympics . On that Monday , Mr. Harding gave every student in Philippe 's class a slip of paper . Written on the slips were the different events : math puzzles , geography , logic games and lots of others . Philippe was given cryptograms . So was Leo Lawson . " Ca n't I work on something else ? " Philippe begged Mr. Harding . " Like math . I 'm good at math . " " Yeah , " Leo said , " Philippe ca n't do word puzzles . He ca n't even speak English . " Philippe snapped , " I speak it better than you do , you .... " He strained to remember his vocabulary . " You foulmouthed , insufferable cretin . " " See ? That is n't English at all . " " It is ! ' Cretin ' means you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temple as though he 'd suddenly gotten a headache . Then he raised his voice and said , " This goes for everyone . We 're competing against the rest of the school for the best class score . We 're not-repeat , not-competing against each other . " He glared between Philippe and Leo . " So play nice . I may have made a mistake , but I put you two together deliberately . I even personalized one of them for you . I think you can help each other solve these cryptograms . Prove me right , O.K. ? " " But ... " Philippe started . When Mr. Harding glared down at him , though , his voice trailed off . Philippe knew what he wanted to say , but as much as he tried to hide it , sometimes his English was n't too great . If he could have spoken in French , he could have said exactly what he meant ; in English , he was left with his mouth hanging open in wordless silence . Finally , Mr. Harding just walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing English just as much as you , " he said , wishing it were true . " Prove it , " Leo said . Philippe frowned . " How ? " Leo held up the sheet of cryptograms , a list of meaningless phrases like S WUM FSE GCSHMW DSWKXSP SCARES GDMXACWB XDUWM GDM GCRGD UY ZRGGUEO AE UGY YDAMY . Philippe knew that these phrases were written in a code in which every letter stood for some different letter , and the trick was to figure out what the message really meant . Leo said , " I bet I can solve these problems before you can . " " But Mr. Harding just said we 're supposed to work together . " " Unless , " Leo continued , as though Philippe had n't spoken , " you 're too scared .... " " Ce n'est pas vrai ! " Philippe exploded . It took a moment for him to realize what he 'd done : In anger , he 'd switched to French without realizing it . Leo was laughing , so Philippe said , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accept . " // " Good . Copy these puzzles down , then . Whoever solves them first wins . " " Why do I having to write the copy ? " " Because you 're shorter than I am . " That , Philippe thought , was classic Leo non-logic . He sighed , copied the phrases , and moved his belongings to a desk as far from Leo as he could get . Most of the cryptograms were pretty easy ; the one he 'd looked at first translated into a quote by Mark Twain , and a second one , MO LFRX OCMFZQXO LFRX , OR RXQ IMX OCMFZQXO MXRHCQF , became a proverb . Philippe managed to finish all but one of the puzzles before lunch , but while in the cafeteria , he overheard that Leo , too , had just one problem left to go . When they returned to the classroom , Philippe joined Leo at his table . " How are you doing on the puzzles ? " " I 'm solving them faster than you , obviously . But this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A stumper . " Catching the questioning look in Philippe 's eye , he added , " That means it 's very hard . What , you do n't know the word ' stumper ' ? " " No , " Philippe said . " Oh . " Leo hesitated , then asked , " What 's it like , anyway ? Trying to use a new language ? " " Well ... it 's hard , sometimes . It 's like ... " Philippe paused , frustrated : Even describing what it felt like to use English required using English . " Close your eyes , " he said at last . . ; Leo frowned , but did so . " Now imagine the color blue . And tell me what it looks like . " " It looks .... " Leo shrugged . " It 's just , blue , you know ? I do n't know how to describe it . " " Exactement , " Philippe said . " That 's how everything is feeling to me . I know what I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like having to speak in cryptograms . " At Philippe 's last word , Leo 's eyes snapped open . " Hey , " he said , suddenly suspicious . " You 're just trying to distract me from the puzzle , are n't you ? " " No . " " Whatever . Go back to your desk , O.K. ? " Philippe returned to his seat and set to work on the last cryptogram : XAGD KNAVDEDAXJAONAVEB , AO TKVMMH EAGE BJWKXXHD . It did n't look all that hard , really : There were two pairs of doubled letters , and if Philippe could figure those out , he might finish before Leo . But three hours later , neither had made any progress . " Yeah , " Leo said , in a half-sympathetic tone , as they passed each other on the way to the buses , " it 's a stumper , all right . " Two hours into the second day of working on the problem , Philippe approached Leo . " Here 's what I 've got so far , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog loop complaint waffle ' . " " I know your English is bad , but that does n't make any sense . " " It was a joke . " " Oh . " Mr. Harding saw them talking and made his way across the room . He set his hands on the back of Leo 's chair . " How 's it going , boys ? " " Not bad , " Leo said . " Good . Because , you know , the teacher whose class wins the Olympics gets extra money for books next year , and I 'd hate to lose out because you two could n't stop arguing . " " Do n't worry , " Philippe said , suddenly feeling miserable . " We 're getting along great . " Mr. Harding raised his eyebrows doubtfully but soon wandered off to look over someone else 's shoulder . For about three more minutes , Philippe worked on the cryptogram alone . Then his conscience got the better of him . " Come on , " he told Leo , " we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that K means A , and B means- " " Do n't tell me that ! " " Why not ? " " Because I want to beat you on my own . " " Oh , please ! You heard Mr. Harding-we could cost his class books ! " " Or I could solve all of these alone . In which case I 'd be the one responsible for winning those books . Ever think of it that way ? " " Sheeeesh . " Philippe drew out the word . " Pour avoir trop convoit , on laisse tout chapper ! " Leo frowned . " Does that even mean anything ? " " It 's a saying . " Philippe sighed . " It means , basically , that when you try to have everything , you end up with nothing . So if you try to get all the credit , neither of us will solve anything . " Leo stared at him blankly . Then his eyes grew huge . " Wait , " he said . " Write that saying down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Philippe did-and as he reached convoit , it clicked . " No way , " he breathed . " Yes way . Check it with me . " Letter by letter , they read through the cryptogram ; letter by letter , they read through the old French aphorisme . Sure enough , they matched ! Leo held up his hand , and Mr. Harding returned to their table . He looked at their solutions , glanced between them , and said , " Not bad , boys , " which was as close as he ever came to high praise . Philippe grinned at Leo , and Leo grinned back . Leo 's grin faded quickly , though , v " Wait , " he said . " So ... who won our challenge ? You or me ? " Philippe rolled his eyes . " Does it matter ? " But one look at Leo told him it did matter , so he said defensively , " You never would have learned the saying without me . " " Well , you would n't have cracked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " who wins ? " For a long moment , their eyes met . Then Leo leaned back in his seat , stretching his arms back comfortably behind his head . " Yeah , that 's the question , " he said , the smile returning to his face . " It 's a stumper , all right . " // Sidebar " I put you two together deliberately , " said the teacher . " I think you can help each other solve these cryptograms . " Sidebar How to Solve the Cryptograms You can solve the cryptograms in this story . To decipher the codes , try replacing every instance of one letter with a different letter . For example , see what happens if you replace all of the As in a message with B 's . When you find the right set of substitutions , the cryptogram will be revealed as an English sentence . Here are some tips to get you started : One-letter words are almost always " a " or " I. " Two-letter words are usually " is , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " so . " Three-letter words are often " the , " " and " or " are . " The most common letters in English are E , T , A , O and I. Cryptogram letters that appear frequently probaby stand for one of those five real letters . S WUM FSE GCSHMW DSWKASP SCARED GDM XACWB XDUWM GDM GCRGD UY ZRGGUEO MO LFRX OR RXQIMX OCMFZQXO MXRHCQF .
