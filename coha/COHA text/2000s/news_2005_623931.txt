<p> When venture capitalists Bill Draper and Robin Richards Donohoe decided they wanted to give back to the community , they came up with a grant-making foundation modeled on the same principles they use in their VC business . <p> The Draper Richards Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship provides early-stage grants of $300,000 over three years to social entrepreneurs with a vision of changing the world . <p> The partners rely on the same due-diligence process and business acumen that brought them success in the financial world . They 're among a growing wave of executives and entrepreneurs who have taken business models into the nonprofit arena , not only giving money but providing strategic expertise , evaluating results and providing multiyear support . <p> This market-based approach to giving is called venture philanthropy and it is n't a new idea . John D. Rockefeller III is credited with coining the term in the late 1960s . While only 42 U.S. foundations identified themselves as venture philanthropists in 2004 , more and more foundations are adopting their hands-on , results-oriented approach , said Laura Arrillaga , who teaches strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could just write a check to someone doing good works , " said Draper , 77 , who was one of the earliest venture capitalists in Silicon Valley . " But that would be different . " <p> Instead , the foundation is closely involved with its grantees , who are called Draper Richards fellows . One of its staff members serves on the fellows ' boards . Fellows establish milestones they 'll meet during the three-year grant period . The grants can be used for any purpose that furthers the social entrepreneur 's work . <p> " We want to pick people who have a light in their eye , " Draper said . The foundation seeks individuals just like those venture capitalists want to fund : entrepreneurs with a compelling vision , a plan for execution , and the drive and willpower to accomplish their goals . <p> Draper Richards concentrates on people whose ideas are still in an early stage so the award will help jump-start their organizations . <p> " There are big foundations to support you once you have proven your model , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in those ' seed rounds , ' " Donohoe , 40 , said . " We like to be the first big money in . " <p> Draper Richards is diminutive by foundation standards , making only six new grants a year . This year , Draper plans to set up a more substantial endowment by donating between $10 million and $25 million he earned from an early investment in Skype , which eBay bought this year for $2.6 billion . By careful selection of recipients , it tries to make its grants have a disproportionate impact . <p> " They are meeting a critical gap in the social market structure , which is funding these early-stage social entrepreneurs , " said Stanford 's Arrillaga . " The work Draper Richards is doing is really quite influential , not necessarily in terms of financial scope when compared with the much larger institutional funders , but rather in being proactive in meeting the needs of nonprofits at a particular stage . " <p> Draper Richards has funded projects that existed only as a business plan . But more typically , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dave Wish was a teacher at a Redwood City school with no music program when he started giving free music lessons to students . The class was so popular that he started another and soon had a flourishing after-school music program . <p> He recruited and trained other teachers in his curriculum , which teaches kids to compose their own music and improvise in a pop idiom . " I only half-jokingly describe it as the Suzuki method meets the Rolling Stones , " he said . <p> The program , which became a nonprofit organization called Little Kids Rock in 2002 , trains teachers and provides instruments for participating students for free . Teachers generally donate their time . <p> Wish had already expanded the program to serve 4,000 children in several states when he became a Draper Richards fellow earlier this year . While the money has already helped the program grow , the **26;4989;TOOLONG support has been just as valuable , he said . <p> " The funding and the organizational support from Draper Richards have been instrumental , " he said . " It has contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their staff on the board of directors . They have helped ( us ) reach milestones through their expertise and coaching . " <p> Other Draper Richards fellows span a variety of disciplines . John Wood started the Room to Read program to build schools and libraries in Southeast Asia and award scholarships to girls . Niko Clifford 's Girls for a Change supports girls tackling community problems , while Aaron Hurst 's Taproot Foundation matches teams of professionals who want to donate their skills with nonprofit groups that have specific needs such as building a Web site . <p> One thing they have in common : All the projects have the ability to expand . <p> " We really want to back people who have a big vision , not just a one-off effort that 's local and not likely to scale , " Draper said . <p> The foundation is also exploring ways it can expand . <p> " We do have a good formula , " Draper said . " We would like to see it have a broader impact .

Roughly half of the 66,000 U.S. grant-making foundations were established since 1990 , according to the Foundation Center in New York . The biggest growth spurt came in the late 1990s , as a new cohort of dot-com millionaires was minted . <p> " With the newly created wealth , people had money earlier in their careers and more of it than they ever expected , " said Julie Juergens , director of the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford Graduate School of Business . " A lot said , ' This is enough for me , now I 'll take this and try to do something really meaningful for society and personally fulfilling as well . ' " <p> Draper and Richards slightly buck that model in that they have n't stepped down from the VC business but simply added the foundation . <p> Draper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , Gen. William Draper , became the first professional West Coast venture capitalist in 1958 , after having overseen economic reconstruction of Germany and Japan under the Marshall Plan . His son , Tim Draper , founded prominent Sand Hill Road firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson . <p> Bill Draper started his first VC firm in 1962 and formed Sutter Hill Ventures in 1965 . He took a hiatus from the field in 1981 to serve as president and chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank , and then in 1986 became administrator and CEO of the United Nations Development Program , the world 's largest resource to help developing countries attract and use aid . <p> " I discovered the world through the U.N. , " he said . " I got to visit 101 developing countries , met with Fidel Castro and Deng Xiaoping . When I came back , I did n't want to do traditional venture capital . I was interested in the world .

They formed Draper International in 1995 , one of the first U.S. VC firms to focus on investments in India . A domestic fund , Draper Richards L.P. , followed in 1996 . They started the foundation in 2001 . <p> Donohoe said the foundation has turned out to be the most fulfilling aspect of her work . <p> " The portfolio is a way for me , my husband and young children to have philanthropy be a way of life , " she said . " It 's truly joyful when you see results of where your money is going .
