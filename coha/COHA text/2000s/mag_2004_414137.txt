Before we went to work on this living room , dark-stained wood and bland walls dated the dreary space . Leave it to Assistant Projects Editor Mary Leigh Fitts to prove that high style does n't have to cost a fortune . First Stop : The Fabric Shop Because the dark wood above the fireplace seemed to take over the space , Mary Leigh suggested using fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorful and cozy . The homeowners ' furniture had neutral upholstery , providing a clean palette to build on . For visual impact , they decided on an Asian print that offers the bright , bold pattern the room lacked . Putting It Together The couple removed center pieces from the paneling to make room for the new upholstered ones . They carefully measured the recessed areas and created frames by nailing together 2-inch-wide wood trim pieces . Next , layers of batting were wrapped around the frames . Finally , the decorative fabric was stretched across the front of the frames and secured to the backs with a staple gun . The panels attach to the wall with self-fastening strips ( available at sewing and craft-supply stores ) that are placed on the backs of the panels and inside the recessed areas on the wall . The panels can easily be removed as the homeowners ' tastes change or if the fabric needs cleaning . Mary Leigh used the fabric to determine the sage green wall color as well as the living room 's overall theme . Red Asian accents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inexpensive oxblood vases accessorize the bookcases . Mary Leigh also replaced plain-Jane shades on the swing-arm lamps with ones that have more personality . A red , woven rug anchors the room . Photograph above : An oversize iron screen makes this petite firebox appear much grander . The new TV stand fits in seamlessly with the room 's architectural features . right : Travertine marble remnants were cut to fit this fireplace-a wallet-friendly idea . // Center Stage When dealing with a bold pattern such as this one , it 's best to use it throughout the room to get the print 's full effect . Try incorporating the fabric as custom Roman shades and accent pillows , like these homeowners did , or as drapery panels . The most visible place , however , is above the fireplace , where you see the entire print . Fast Fix-up After updating the mantel area , they focused on the fireplace . The brick surround was painted the same color as the walls for a unified look . A trip to a stone shop proved profitable for this couple . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble . After the tiles were tossed , a large piece of kraft paper was used to make a template of the area . It is important to note the precise measurements directly on the template ; an 1/8-inch difference can affect the fit . The couple found a marble remnant and had it cut into three pieces for easy installation . Working with a remnant allowed the couple to use a more expensive product on a budget . Once in place , the marble was secured with grout . ( Hint : Use a grout that 's the same color as the stone for a seamless look . ) The final accessory is really more like artwork . Commissioned by the homeowners , a local artist designed and crafted a new , oversize iron fire screen that was inspired by bamboo . Media Center Smarts Narrow bookcases left no space for electronic equipment , so a carpenter made a triangular base that rests on the floor . The front panel , which conceals a DVD player , looks like a continuation of the baseboards . Photograph Sidebar REVIVE YOUR LIVING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite hue from it to paint on the walls .
