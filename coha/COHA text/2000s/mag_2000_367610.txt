It has everything you want in an epic : sweep , scope , wild reversals of fortune and plenty of bold , basic emotions . It offers a stalwart hero and a sneering villain , bloody battles and daring rescues , tender love , heedless cruelty and , above all , scores of attractive human beings who have pledged their lives , fortunes and sacred honor to a desperate but noble cause . <P> What 's not to like about The Patriot ? Well it certainly suffers from irony deficiency . It is four-square for democracy and decency , and this , of course , will cause a certain amount of superciliousness among the postmodernist swells . Since it is a story about the American Revolution , it will suffer from the age-old suspicion of movies in which guys wear knee britches and write with quill pens . But if the mass audience can get behind Gladiator , why should n't it take a flier on more recent history ? You telling us Russell Crowe is cuter than Mel Gibson ? Or in his picture suffers more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast as a grieving widower named Benjamin Martin . In the French and Indian War he was a gallant , not to say legendary , commander , but something bad happened in its course  --  a preventable atrocity , we eventually learn  --  and he is determined to raise his numerous progeny in peace and prosperity on his South Carolina plantation . In the state assembly he votes against raising troops and money for a war of independence . This alienates his son Gabriel ( charmingly played by Heath Ledger ) , who joins the Continental Army . And it reckons without the relentless cruelty of Colonel William Tavington ( whom Jason Isaacs plays with ferocious candor , offering neither excuses nor a single redeeming grace ) . <P> One day , in hot pursuit of retreating rebel soldiers , Tavington comes riding up to Martin 's plantation at the head of a cavalry troop . Insouciantly , even rather jauntily , he orders all the Americans  --  most of them wounded  --  to be shot , the plantation fired , and for good measure , he marches Gabriel ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burwell , played by Chris Cooper ) off to be hanged . When one of Martin 's other sons tries to rescue his brother , he is coldly murdered . <P> It is this psychopathy that begets Martin 's patriotism . With two of his other boys , he rescues Gabriel from the hanging party in what is surely director Roland Emmerich 's most dashing set piece . This action establishes Martin , whose character is surely based in part on Francis Marion , the not-as-nice " swamp fox " of the Revolution , as a great , almost ghostly guerrilla leader . Also , it personalizes the war for him . At some point , we know , he must confront the hateful Tavington mano a mano.
