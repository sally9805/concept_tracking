Hardware by Joan Bauer They tried to drag Aunt Phil from the street . It should n't have been that hard . To begin with she is n't too big . Five foot four to be exact . She is n't that young either . Fifty-three as of last Tuesday . But she was angry and she had a hammer . The brand she 'd just put on sale for $9.99 . And she was raising that tool , spitting fury at a huge hole in the ground one block long ; shrieking at a four-story gargantuan plastic Waldo head that was being erected right before her eyes . Cali tried gently but firmly to get her inside , but there 's just so much a teenager can do against an aunt with a hammer . Lewis , Cali 's half cousin , tried to help , but he always made things worse . " Everyone 's looking at you , Phil . You want them to think you 're crazy ? " Aunt Phil turned to him with half-crazy eyes . " The world 's gone mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cali . " Am I right ? " Cali half squirmed . " Sort of , Aunt Phil . You 're sort of right . " Aunt Phil had always been a fighter . When the mayor had proposed a zoning tax on small businesses , Aunt Phil took to the streets , screaming that small business owners were going to fight back and defend their stores " with our bare feet if necessary . " " That 's bare hands , Aunt Phil , " Cali had whispered . " Whatever . " Phil stood tough . When two shoplifters tried to rob her store blind , Phil cornered them with her turbocharged staple gun . " Drop the merchandise , scumbags , or I 'll staple your nostrils together . " Big Mel , Cali 's partial uncle , called the police , who hauled those terrified thieves off to jail . " You plot against the innocent , you pay ! " Phil screamed , waving her staple gun . " You 're not innocent , lady ! " one of the robbers shouted back . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going to make the glass run over . You never know what 's going to split the last straw down the backside . " And what it was for Aunt Phil and Cali 's family and Phil 's Hardware Store and all the little family-run stores on Lattice Avenue was Waldo 's SuperStore moving in across the street . One block long . They had everything . Groceries . Hardware . Paint . Clothes . Whatever a human being needed , Waldo 's had it . At discount prices . No small store could survive when a Waldo 's came to town . Aunt Phil raised an angry fist at the Waldo 's truck as it rumbled by . " You think you can just move in here with your big muck trucks and tear out my heart in public ? You think God is not going to judge you for putting up your establishment right across from where my father , may God rest his soul , built this store brick by brick by the sweat of his person ? " Cali cleared her throat to keep Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Phil 's father , Andrew , who was Cali 's great-uncle , paid his sister 's second husband , Wilfred , to build it . " This is sacred ground , you morons ! " Store owners on Lattice Avenue were coming outside to see what all the racket was about . Lester Malloy from Lester 's Grill . Mrs. Caselli from the bakery . Mr. and Mrs. Toole from AAA Extermination and their no-good son , Weston . They stood there and let her rail , like a family with a crazy relative who no one can keep quiet . When you 've been through what these store owners had been through , everyone on the street was like family . Weston scratched his stomach and half leered at Cali . Cali always suspected that AAA Extermination 's key weapon against rats was Weston . One look at Weston and any self-respecting rat would run for cover . Phil put her hammer down . A good sign . Lewis moved closer . Gently picked up the hammer . Aunt Phil let Cali guide her inside . When a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot out of you . Big Mel had finished four glazed doughnuts , almost without chewing . He sloshed the coffee in his mug , took a slurp , and said , " Look , we ca n't fight it . Waldo 's has offered us not much to sell the store , but it 's either that or die , slowly bleeding in the street . " Big Mel was Aunt Phil 's half brother . Most relationships in Cali 's family were explained by fractions . " I do n't bleed in public , " Phil announced , whose role in the family was to dispute whatever Big Mel said . " We 're not going to get anywhere this way , " Cali 's mother said . Cali 's mother 's role in the family was to try to help people be reasonable . It was a lonely job . " He 's happy to sell out to pirates ! " Aunt Phil screamed . " Pirates do n't give you money , " Big Mel shouted back . " They steal . " Aunt Phil said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kitchen table as she always did when the family had a meeting . She tried to be like her mother  --  look at both sides . But these sides were too different . Her whole family was different . She was most like her mother , but she did n't have the patience . She was n't anything like Phil  --  no one was  --  she and Lewis were from different planets . And Big Mel was sick of the store , sick of hardware , and just wanted to sell , get out , and move to Boise . " Okay . . . " Her mom took out a legal pad and started making a list . Making lists made Phil nuts because she never agreed with what got on the list . Big Mel did n't like lists someone else made . " So how come you 're so all-fired sure we 've got to sell ? " Phil shouted at Mel . " Because I worked it out . " " Where ? " Phil already knew the answer . Big Mel pointed to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's in your empty head , you want me to hand over the legacy of my father and his father before him , who had to flee from Cossacks to give us this home in a free land ? " Big Mel ate another doughnut . " They got on a boat from Ireland , Phil . There are no Cossacks in Ireland . " " Cossacks are everywhere , " Phil growled and turned to Cali , who refused to make eye contact . Continues ...
