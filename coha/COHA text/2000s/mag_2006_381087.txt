Pugnacious anthems and racist diatribes have never been in short supply at Nordic Fest , an annual white-power Woodstock held over the Memorial Day break near the former mining town of Dawson Springs , Ky . And this past weekend was no exception . On the agenda were a Triumph of the Will  --  themed running event and a cross " lighting " sponsored by the Imperial Klans of America . But something new did arise at Nordic Fest this year : bellicose talk and plans of action against illegal immigrants . Among the scheduled guest speakers was Hal Turner , a New Jersey Internet radio talk-show host who recently instructed his audience to " clean your guns , have plenty of ammunition ... and then do what has to be done " to undocumented workers . <P> With immigration perhaps America 's most volatile issue , a troubling backlash has erupted among its most fervent foes . There are , of course , the Minutemen , the self-appointed border vigilantes who operate in several states . And now groups of militiamen , white supremacists and neo-Nazis are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. as a potent rallying cry . " The immigration furor has been critical to the growth we 've seen " in hate groups , says Mark Potok , head of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center . The center counts some 800 racist groups operating in the U.S. today , a 5% spurt in the past year and a 33% jump from 2000 . " They think they 've found an issue with racial overtones and a real resonance with the American public , " says Potok , " and they are exploiting it as effectively as they can . " <P> Both Potok 's group and the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) are worried that extremists are burrowing their way into the anti-immigration mainstream . Mark Martin , 43 , of Covington , Ohio , is a chef at a French restaurant and tends his backyard organic garden . But he also dons the black and brown uniform of western Ohio 's National Socialist ( read : Nazi ) Movement . " There 's nothing neo about us , " he says . Martin admits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As Americans , we have the right to make a citizen 's arrest and detain them , " he insists . " And if they try to get away , we have the right to get physical with them . " Martin gleefully boasts about leading eight fellow storm troopers in disrupting a May 1 pro-immigrant rally in Dayton by taunting protesters . Although police ultimately restrained him , Martin believes his agitation was worthwhile because it attracted new recruits . " After the rally , the Klan called us , " he says . " Now we 've started working together more often . " <P> In addition to white supremacists , the immigration debate seems to have reinvigorated members of the antigovernment militias of the 1990s . Those groups largely disbanded after the Oklahoma City bombing orchestrated by militia groupie Timothy McVeigh and , later , the failure of a Y2K bug to trigger the mass chaos some militia members expected . " We 've seen people from Missouri and Kentucky militias involved in border-vigilante activity , especially with the gung-ho Arizona group Ranch Rescue that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Pitcavage , fact-finding director of the ADL . " It 's a natural shift . Militias fell on hard times , and this anti-immigration movement is new and fresh . "
