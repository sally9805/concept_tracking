Don Mead 's first published story was " iKlawa " in our April 2006 issue . He returns now with a daring story that takes us back almost 160 years to El Dorado County , California , where we meet a young woman with a most unusual conflict facing her . Mr. Mead reports that he is working on more short stories . He serves on sf convention panels in the Midwest promoting short fiction as a way to build a writing career . He 's also a moderator for the writer 's workshop at Windycon in Chicago . <p> CHRIST 'S DEAD EYES OPENED and he gave me a blood-soaked stare . My yelp was swallowed up by the lingering chords of the hymn . I grabbed Mrs. Mora 's arm and pointed at the wooden crucifix that hung at the front of the sanctuary . She gave it a look and shrugged . " A lot of things are going to be different in a Catholic church , Virginia . Our cross has Christ nailed to it . You might think it 's distasteful , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I regarded the crucifix again . Christ sagged , eyes closed . Maybe it was just the mountains come-a-calling , although the horror had never before followed me into church . That always had been my safe place . My breathing eased as we sat . Mrs. Mora tucked the hymnal away and handed me several loose sheets of paper . " Have you been following along ? " She touched her finger to one of the sheets . " We 're here . " I nodded and took the sheets , giving Christ a quick glance . I fought the urge to yank off the thin black scarf Mrs. Mora had given me to wear over my hair - over my hat , really . I did n't know women wore scarves in Catholic church , and I had so wanted to make a good impression with my little round hat fixed up with flowers and feathers . It matched perfectly with my calico hooped skirt and jacket . But when Mrs. Mora saw it , she had insisted I wear " a modest scarf . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't do since it was fixed with pins and held my curls up . Mama had helped me with the hat that morning . She put her love into it despite the circumstances . " Please come with us to the Methodist service at the fort , " she had said . " One Christian is as good as another in God 's eyes . " " You know the vow I made in the mountains , Mama . " I smiled , but the look she returned held only anguish . Papa had hitched up the carriage for me ; I could n't ride horseback in a hooped skirt . He did n't answer when I said good-bye . People in the front pews rose and shuffled into the center aisle , led by a man in a dark jacket and matching trousers . His thick black hair was tied back and stuffed down his collar . They lined up in front of the priest . Father O'Rourke seemed almost dwarfish standing before the man in the dark jacket . I guessed the Spanish cowboy-vaqueros Mrs. Mora called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieved a plate of wafers from the altar . He took one and held it up . " Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi custodiat animam tuam in vitam aeternam . Amen . " He placed the wafer in the man 's mouth . I looked at the papers again - Mrs. Mora 's handwritten translations . May the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul unto everlasting life . Amen . The man turned away and the next in line , a much shorter vaquero , just a bit taller than Father O'Rourke , stepped forward . Mrs. Mora nudged me and gave me an impish smile . " So many men . " I felt myself flush and looked away . The church was filled with men - women sprinkled among them like cactus flowers . Many were Spanish , but there were also Irish , German , and American immigrants . Mrs. Mora leaned closer . " There 's so much work to be done . Jobs are bringing men from everywhere . Some people are getting rich . " She poked me to make me look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry ? " I shook my head . " Sixteen . " " But soon , " she said . " And your pick of men . " I looked forward to keep from laughing . " When I write to my cousins in Springfield , I tell them to forget Illinois and come to California . They could get a good man in no time . " " And things will only get better once we become a state , " said Mrs. Mora . " I hope they send more priests . So many souls to save . So many baptisms . " People in the next pew stood and moved to the aisle . " What should I do when it 's our turn ? " Mrs. Mora reddened . " Oh , nothing this time . The Holy Eucharist is for Catholics only . But you wo n't have long to wait to receive the body of Christ . Were you a Christian before ... ? " Her voice became strained . " Before you joined the Etonner train ? " " Yes . Methodist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released a pent-up breath . " You wo n't have to be baptized - just a profession of faith and confession . Then you can consume the body - I mean , join in the Eucharist . " Mrs. Mora looked down and fiddled with the hymnal . I patted her hand . " It 's all right . I know it 's not really flesh . " She looked at me and gave a distressed smile . " But Virginia , it 's symbolic only for Protestants . Not in the Catholic faith . Once the bread has been sanctified by the priest , it is very much the body of Christ . You consume His flesh , drink His blood , and accept His divinity . " Father O'Rourke 's voice filled the tiny sanctuary . " Quod ore sumpsimus , Domine , pura mente capiamus . " I looked at the translation to fight a stab of panic . What has passed our lips as food , Lord , may we possess in purity of heart . " But you wo n't taste flesh or blood or bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bread . It 's part of the miracle of the Eucharist . Sister Rosa was supposed to explain all of this . " I shook my head . The Sister was probably just as concerned for my sensitivity as Mrs. Mora . I looked at the crucifix . This is your first test , is n't it ? But you ca n't test me like you did Job . After the mountains , you know I can withstand anything . I cocked my head . Christ 's face seemed different . I squinted , trying to see through the haze of incense . His eyes were open again , and the crown of thorns was gone . His beard was longer , and his face was even more gaunt than before . I forced down a scream and tugged on Mrs. Mora 's dress . " Do you see anything wrong with the crucifix ? Look at the face . " She studied it for a moment . " No one knows how Christ actually looked . You see a lot of different faces on crucifixes . " She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You had to battle Satan before you could recognize his devices . The Enemy had followed me from the mountains and had taken the feral face of that awful Hessian , Louis Keseberg . I stiffened as the wooden head swiveled to look at me . His lips moved and a whisper found my ears . " It 's too late for you , Virginia . You 've tasted unsanctified flesh . You belong to my army , not His . And our battle for California is about to begin . " I grew dizzy and closed my eyes . The battle 's long over . You should 've stayed buried in the mountains . A bang at the back of the sanctuary caused me to open my eyes . I looked back , along with the rest of the parishioners , to see a young ranchhand in filthy work clothes standing by the open doors . He fought labored breathing . " They found gold at Sutter 's Mill ! " I lifted my skirt and dodged a pile of horse manure . Sutter 's Fort was n't nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gas lighting and street sweepers . But the warm sunny winters more than compensated for rough living . A man , unkempt , smelly , and toting a basket of otter furs , smiled as he walked by . Papa was right - there were endless ways to make a living in California , depending on how hard you were willing to work and what unpleasantries you were able to endure . I used to worry about having lost all of the cattle , but not anymore . A year had passed since our rescue from the mountains , and Papa 's work at Sutter 's Mill had afforded us a house next to Hock Farm . It was a good thing Captain Sutter was a Christian . All these men streaming in from the States with pockets full of money - it was a troublesome combination . But the Captain did n't allow alcohol to be sold at the fort , and he was most intolerant of gambling and women who made gain of their loose virtue . I stopped and looked back at the worn paddock that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were usually soldiers coming , going , or sitting in front of the barrack having a smoke . If I did n't fend off at least one marriage proposal during a visit I considered it a wasted trip . Today - nothing . I ducked into Mackey 's Store . A wide brown dress topped with a bun of blonde hair was busy shelving canned beans . Doris turned and smiled . " Virginia . Your mother was in just this morning . Did she forget something ? " I shook my head and glanced around . " Where 's Mackey ? " " Gone ! " She wheeled and returned to stacking . The cans clacked as she put her weight into her work . " Damn fool ! Off with a bunch of men to find their fortune . Can you believe it ? Not three days after some kid finds gold up in the hills and the whole valley 's gone loco . " She stopped and looked at me . I noticed her eyes were puffy and red . " Forgetting the good solid work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our wagons and horses . " Doris turned to the counter where some loose tobacco lay next to an open tin can . She wiped her hands on her apron . " And for what ? To chase a dream ? California 's about hard work , not easy riches . " " Is that where all the soldiers are ? " She nodded and started sweeping up tobacco with her hand . " But who 's guarding the fort ? What if there 's trouble ? What if someone gets stranded in the mountains again ? " She dumped tobacco into the can and closed the lid . " Well , there you have it , girl . A man can be as dumb as a horse . Dangle a carrot in front of his eyes and he 'll go right off a cliff . Guess it 's up to you and me . I 'm as strong as any man , and Lord knows you have history tracking around those mountains . " I shivered . " I hope it does n't come to that . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't Captain Sutter do something ? Order the men back to work ? " " The Captain 's up at the mill trying to keep squatters off his property - mostly his own men . Is n't that a dandy ? He hires these men , clothes and feeds them , and then they turn on him . It 's devil 's gold . Brings out the worst in folks . A lot of them are so-called Christians . And what do you think is going to follow ? " I shrugged . " Every slacker , sinner , charlatan , and shyster is going to come riding over the mountains to get a share of that gold . And every harlot in the country will be hot on their heels . " MY OWN HEELS pounded the boardwalk . I had stayed too long at Mackey 's just to hear bad news , and now I was in danger of being late to the Catholic ladies " social . So it would be a war . The horrible vision in church had been right , but God was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must have been too deep in thought . I came upon a man , his back turned , and had to skid to a halt to avoid a collision . He turned and greeted me with a toothy grin and vacant eyes . " The end of the world is at hand . " " Keseberg ! " His grin faded , and although his dust-covered , reeking body was only a few feet away , he squinted as if he needed glasses . " Virginia Reed ? " " You know it 's me ! You tried to convince the party to hang my father back in the Sierra Nevadas ! Did the mountains scatter your brains ? " His eyes drifted as mine sometimes did when those awful memories took hold . " Why did n't they listen ? We should 've hanged him . " He babbled a couple of words in German . I considered launching myself at him , but his fleas kept me at bay . " If they had , no one would 've ridden ahead to the fort and brought back help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more would you have eaten ? " His eyes shifted to me . " I only did what was necessary to survive . We all did . " " That 's a lie ! You murdered Levinah Murphy . Captain Sutter 's men found her jewelry in your pockets and her body butchered in your cabin ! " " Missus Murphy . " His eyes wandered again . " Funny , her meat was actually sweet to the taste . " My hand lashed . Keseberg staggered back and rubbed his cheek . " I underestimate your strength , young one . But it 's a bit hypocritical , do n't you think ? " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " My voice cracked with rage . His smile deepened . " Virginia . Half the party died in the Sierra Nevadas . The Donners are still up there-their scattered bones , anyway . " " Shut your mouth ! " " Were n't the Donners your friends ? Did n't you all come from Illinois in the same wagon train ? " I could only give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you placed their flesh on the fire and ate it ? You hate me because you ca n't bear your own guilt . " I glanced around . The dirt street and boardwalks were still empty . " Turn your other cheek , Keseberg . My Christian attitude just ran out . " Keseberg laughed . " Why are you acting so righteous ? Who are you trying to impress ? " He glanced at the fort 's muster hall where the Catholic ladies were meeting . " Were you going to that Catholic sitzung ? You still think you saw God in the mountains ? How arrogant ! The rest of us met the devil and you met God . Well , do n't waste your time - the Catholics do n't take cannibals . " " I never did . I never did ! " Fury was making me light-headed so I turned and stalked down the boardwalk . It was too late to make a dignified entrance to the meeting , and I was too angry to make good company . Keseberg called after me . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat her whole ! " I spotted a work-hand as I rode up to the church . He was set to chopping away at the brush creeping up on the north wall . The poor man was overmatched , with nothing but a tomahawk he must have bought before coming over the mountains . He hacked away as if he could hold back nature . Two miles from the fort , nature was still in charge . I gave a start when he turned . It was Father O'Rourke , sweat soaking through the chest and armpits of his white shin . He smiled . " Thought I heard a horse . I was hoping it was Charles Murphy coming to help me with this overgrowth . How are you , Virginia ? " He had a sing-song accent just like Papa 's - straight from Ireland . I dismounted and tied Jeebers to the picket fence that bordered the church grounds . " I 'm fine , Father . And I 'll be glad to help . " He looked me up and down . " Not in that nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work gloves and sat on the church stoop . I joined him . " Did you bring a letter from your father ? " I shook my head . " Papa 's being stubborn . " " He 's Irish Protestant , is n't he ? " " Yes . " There was a strange sadness in the Father 's eyes . " I 'll still need his permission to continue with your conversion . Otherwise , you 'll have to wait until you 're older . " " I 'll work on him , " I said , brushing road dust off my dress . " I thought you were a work-hand when I first rode up . " He glanced at the overgrowth . " Lost my trunk on the voyage to New York . It had all of my frocks in it . The Church was in such a hurry to get more priests into California , I did n't have time to get new ones . The one I use now is borrowed from Father Rodriguez . " " Maybe Missus Mora could make you a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my measurements with a priest in New York . He 'll send some new ones along soon enough . " He looked at me . " Speaking of Missus Mora , she said you did n't come to the Catholic ladies meeting yesterday . If you want to show God your commitment , you 'll have to try harder than that . " " I had a run-in with Louis Keseberg . I should 've ignored him , but I let him bait me . He said I was a cannibal , same as him . " I looked into the Father 's eyes . " I slapped him , and I 'm truly repentant . " I had the impression he was holding back a laugh . " There 'll be plenty of confessions in your future . No one is without sin . We 'll worry about penance after you become a Catholic . " " Do you think I 'm a cannibal , Father ? " " No , lass . If you say you 're not , then I believe you . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to destroy God 's creation ? " He gave me a long look . " You have to ask ? I 'm a priest . " " That 's good . Because I do too . He did horrible things up in the mountains . I saw it . And I think he 's here among us in California . " " You 're talking about this gold find , are n't you ? " I nodded . He looked over my shoulder toward the mountains . " On that we agree , lass . I 've seen sensible men leave their jobs and families and go traipsing off with nothing more than a mule and a pick . All in search of a golden idol . " " But I 've seen God too . I 've seen Him beat the devil . " He smiled . " This part of the story I 've heard from Patrick Breen . " " And none better to tell it , " I said . " Every night while we were stuck in the mountains , Mama and I would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd run out of food weeks earlier and were down to eating tree bark and tallow . He 'd pull out his Bible and find a verse that gave us enough strength to face another day . Then he 'd end the night with a prayer , but not any " thank you kindly , Lord " everyday prayer . He 'd belt out a thank you so full of happiness it would scare the wolves away from the cattle bones . And he 'd wail about the sinfulness of mankind as to make you wish you could crawl under a rock . By the time he 'd finish , we were so full of Spirit the skin hanging off our bones and the barren state of our bellies were no longer a burden . " " And that 's when you made your vow ? That 's when you decided to become a Catholic ? " " Yes . Mister Breen was Catholic , and I thought if being a Catholic made you that strong , so strong you could stand up to starvation while others had taken to eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I have great respect for Mister Breen , " Father O'Rourke said . " An Irishman cut from the old cloth like my own pap . He 'd be so proud of you now . " " It does my heart good that you say so , Father . But the true nature of my visit is this Eucharist business . " He raised an eyebrow . " I 'm told it 's the consumption of the flesh of Christ . " Understanding seemed to take hold in his face . " Put your heart at rest , lass . It 's not cannibalism . " " But it is the eating of His flesh , is n't it ? No symbolism in the Catholic faith . Take , eat . This is my body , " He said . " His smile now looked practiced . " It 's consumption of His spiritual flesh , not His physical flesh . It is a gift He left us to experience His divine nature on Earth . Do n't fret . " " But I do fret , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would never eat human flesh . I do n't make such vows lightly . " " Nor should you , lass . But it 's not cannibalism . " " Did God 's son come to us in the flesh ? " He nodded , no longer smiling . " When you bless the bread , is it just bread or is it Christ ? " " It is Christ . But Virginia , to become a Catholic , at some point you must partake in the Eucharist . " I looked away . " My vows are at odds . " Father O'Rourke put his work gloves back on and stood . " Then you must choose . " I LIKED SATURDAYS . The school at Sutter 's Fort was closed on the weekend , and on sunny days Papa would let me take Jeebers to the Sacramento River and I 'd fish the day away . Funny - Captain Sutter tried to name it Sutter 's River when he was building the fort so many years ago . Mrs. Mora told me the Spanish would have none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named it nearly a hundred years earlier , and that was that . But today was no day for fishing . I got out of bed , put on a dress , and went to look for Mama . I found her hoeing in the garden . " About time you woke up . Get a hoe and start at the far side of that row of beans . " I picked up a hoe , but I started on the closer end of the row . If she noticed , she did n't say anything . Her face was well shaded by a straw bonnet , and she kept her eyes on her work , pounding away at weeds and dirt clods . The hem of her blue dress was tinged brown with dust . " Mama ? " " Hm ? " " You remember back in the mountains , right at Christmas time ? " She did n't look up . " You know I do n't like talking about the mountains . " " I know , but this is important . Do you remember ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be too sad to even remember Christmas , but the next day , you put on your best smile and cooked us a Christmas meal . " " I do n't remember . " Her voice was strange , hollow . She kept hoeing . " How could you not remember ? We had n't eaten proper food in weeks , and we were living off tallow that made us sick half the time . And this Christmas meal comes out of nowhere like a gift from heaven . " She worked faster and began to move away . I threw down my hoe and marched in front of her . She stopped and looked at me . Her eyes were wide and her face frozen . " That Christmas stew , Mama . The onions were mostly rotten and the broth was made from boiled leather , but where did that meat come from ? " " Tripe from the oxen . " Her words were a tremble , just above a whisper . " It was n't tripe ! " I grabbed her hoe and yanked it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and tried to hide a grimace and welling tears with her hands . " There was blood-meat in that stew , Mama . Where 'd it come from ? " " Oh honey . You 've got to understand . We were going to die . I had to . " I could n't stop my own tears . " What did you do , Mama ? " I grabbed her shoulders . " What did you do to me ? " " It was Billy . I 'm so sorry ... sorry . " She took a long suck of air and sobbed . I let her go . " Billy ? " She dropped her hands and nodded , still crying . " I remembered where he 'd died in the fall . I did n't have to dig through much snow since the wolves had done most of the work for me . They 'd made off with most of the meat , but there was a clump of flesh left that was good for eating . " She looked me in the eyes . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special . " " Billy ? " I started to laugh . Mama looked at me , sniffling . When my laughing did n't stop , she planted her fists on her hips . " Have you gone crazy , girl ? I just told you the most God-awful secret I kept buried in my heart and all you can do is laugh . " I recovered enough to fetch Mama 's hoe and hand it back to her . " I just found out I ate my own pony . " I picked up my hoe . " I feel like the weight of the world 's been Ufted off my shoulders . " Mama wiped her nose , gave me a cross look , and went back to work . " I suppose this has something to do with this Catholic nonsense you 've taken up . Did that priest tell you to go and scare the dickens out of your mother ? " " It does have something to do with this Catholic business , and no , Father O'Rourke would n't ask anyone to do such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Nothing . I mean , I 'm sorry for scaring you , and you did the right thing putting poor old Billy in the stew . I loved him , but there was no sense in us starving while the wolves were getting fat . " We worked away in silence for a little while . " Your papa and I had a little talk this morning before he set off for the mill . " I stopped hoeing . " And ? " " Well , we both agreed that you 're becoming a young lady now , and that you 're not likely to let go of this Catholic vow of yours . " I held my breath . " You 're old enough to make this decision on your own . He wrote a letter for the priest and put it on the table . " I dropped my hoe and charged for the house . I heard Mama call after me . " You ca n't finish your hoeing first ? " I did n't answer . I found the letter and ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden gawking at me as I rode by . " I 'll be back in an hour , I promise . " I dug my heels into Jeebers and shouted . " Thank you , Mama ! And tell Papa I love him ! " " Virginia Reed ! Stop riding that horse like a man ! " " I 'm sorry , Sister Beatrice . " I really was n't sorry . Not even Catholic yet and I was piling up sins like an undertaker piling up gold teeth . I dismounted and pushed my dress down to cover my legs . I 'd forgotten about putting on riding trousers under my dress when I started out . Had there been soldiers about when I rode into the fort , I would 've dismounted at the gate and led Jeebers in by the rein . Marriage proposals were one thing , -1 could brush those off by the bushel . But I did n't know what I 'd do if a soldier tried to encourage some son of base behavior from me . Maybe I 'd run away . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it was , the soldiers were still neglecting their duties and out digging for gold . All I had to endure was a cross Sister Beatrice . I held tight to Jeebers even though he was in no mood for wandering . I 'd given him quite a ride from home . " I 'm trying to find Father O'Rourke . No one answered at his cabin so I came to the ion hoping he was here . " I knew he sometimes held meetings with the Sisters at their dormitory on the fort grounds , and I did n't want to ride the extra miles to the church if I could help it . The Sister 's eyes blazed . " I should speak to your mother about your poor habits . Half the men around here have n't seen an unmarried woman for over a year . If they catch a glimpse of you with your dress hiked up over your knees .... " " Please , Sister Beatrice . I have to find the Father . My papa is letting me join the church . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold stare . " Well , everyone is looking for the Father . He 's at church , so you 've got two miles to practice ladylike riding . " " Thank you . " I led Jeebers toward the fort 's gate . I was in too much of a hurry for ladylike riding , so I 'd have to mount up out of the Sister 's sight . Something tickled my interest . I turned . " Sister ? " " Yes ? " " What did you mean when you said everyone was looking for the Father ? " " I mean that Louis Keseberg was looking for him all morning . Louis said he needed to be baptized a Catholic right away . Said he was dying or some such nonsense , and wanted to leave this world as a Christian . " The Sister rolled her eyes . " He looked perfectly healthy to me . " " Louis Keseberg ? " She nodded . " That 's why Father O'Rourke is at the church . He and Louis went out there for a baptism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . " Are they alone ? " " Yes . " She paused and shook her head . " I mean no . Sister Rosa should be there this time of day . It 's her turn to clean the church . " I did n't care if Sister Beatrice saw my bare legs . I ignored her yells as I kicked Jeebers into a gallop . I SAW RISING SMOKE as I neared the church , and I was afraid I 'd find nothing but charred timbers . When I arrived , the church was safe and sound . The smoke was coming from behind the building . I tied off Jeebers , picked up a stout branch good for hitting , and ran around back . There was Louis Keseberg , sitting on a log , as pleased as a cat with a mouse . He whistled a tune as he roasted a piece of meat at the end of a stick over a fire , which he must have built from the remnants of the church 's construction . Two daggers were propped on a log next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor sharp . Their hilts looked of ivory , carved in the shape of some tormented soul in the last throes of life . They gave me a chill . A groan caused me to turn toward the back wall of the church . There was Father O'Rourke , tied and laying on the ground . Blood leaked from his forehead , and there were red splatters on his white vestments . His eyes slowly drifted in my direction . " Run , Virginia . Get to the fort . " His voice was weak and raspy . Keseberg quit his whistling and turned to look at me . " Ah , Virginia . Fate decreed you would come , although I 'm often a Doubting Thomas . Come have lunch with me . " He withdrew the meat from the fire and poked at it with his finger . My heart raced and I gripped my branch with both hands . " Keseberg , what have you done ? " My voice sounded strange - high and shrill . " It 's not so much what I 've done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join God 's army since the mountains-indeed , you were meant to join , but Mister Breen got in the way . He may have put this Catholic obsession in your head , but fate wo n't be denied . " I took a step forward and raised the branch . He was a good twenty feet away and could reach those knives before I got a lick at him . " God 's army ? You 've been hand-in-hand with the devil all this time , have n't you ? " Keseberg extended the meat back into the flames . " God ... the devil . Really competing gods . Do n't you find it ironic that they both require cannibalism of their soldiers ? Maybe it 's more than ironic . In any case , my god was quite upset that you denied him in the mountains . It seems there 's something very special in you , though for the life of me , I ca n't see it . " He examined the meat again and turned to me . " It 's time for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a good look at the meat . I had seen its like before . I looked at Father O'Rourke , but other than a nasty gash on the forehead , he seemed fine . " Run , lass , " he said . " Stop thinking about it . " Keseberg laughed . " She wo n't run . " Quick as a snake , he snatched up one of the knives and pointed it toward the Father , who lay about ten feet away . " She knows what I 'll do to you if she does . " I forced myself to breathe . I had left all my tears in the mountains , but I had hate to burn . I imagined it showed in my eyes . " Where 's Sister Rosa ? " Keseberg kept the knife poised at Father O'Rourke . " Where does one make a sacrifice ? On the altar , my dear . " I ran to the church 's back door . " Do n't look , Virginia , " Father O'Rourke said . " It 's horrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible . For all the sharpness of those knives , Keseberg had been savage with the Sister 's innards . I had once seen a sheep carcass after coyotes had finished with it . Very similar . Keseberg had even used pan of the Sister 's offal as a garland around the crucifix . Father O'Rourke probably expected wailing when I came back outside , but I was sure Keseberg knew better . He now stood over the Father with the knife ready to strike . " Throw the branch on the fire , Virginia . " Keseberg was still too far away for me to make a charge . He had it all figured out . I glanced at the log he had been sitting on as I walked to the fire . The other knife was gone . I tossed the branch in the flames , and it began to crackle . " Afraid of a sixteen-year-old girl ? " " The mountains made you strong , Virginia , and I like all of the advantages . " Keseberg stepped around the sitting log and approached . The roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He presented it . " loin . " Father O'Rourke rolled on his side to face us . " Do n't do it , Virginia . It 's forbidden - a terrible sin . " Keseberg gave a soulless laugh . " Her strength works against her now , priest . Her spirit sustained her in the mountains , but now she 'll sacrifice herself to save you . " " Hold it steady . " I grabbed his arm to stop him from moving , although my shaking was n't improving matters . He pointed the knife at my heart . " Turn back now and it will cost both your lives . " I knew there was no turning back . " Corpus Domininostri Jesu Christi ... " May the body of our Lord Jesus Christ ... I looked back at Father O'Rourke . A blessing for Satan 's feast ? Keseberg 's voice turned harsh . " A wasted prayer , priest . You ca n't sanctify this meat . The knives I used came straight from Satan 's heart . It ca n't be blessed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve your soul unto everlasting life . " No hesitation , Virginia , " Keseberg said . " Now is the time . " I still held his arm . I pulled it closer . " Amen , " Father O'Rourke said . Maybe Keseberg was right . Father O'Rourke 's blessing could n't overcome the evil of the knives ... ... had he been trying to bless the meat . I bit deeply , and my mouth filled with the taste of buttered crust and stone-baked bread . Keseberg howled and staggered back . He dropped his knife to hold his wrist and dangling hand . Bone and vessels were severed cleanly , following the shape of my mouth . Blood spouted to his heart 's rhythm . I shoved him , and he went toppling over a log . He looked up at me . His feral look was gone and his eyes were wide . " Stay away ! " I leapt on him . Grabbing his shoulder with one hand , I forced his head back with the other . His screaming ended as I bit through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earthy rye . My mouth was so full of bread I could n't swallow . I put my lips to a broken , pumping artery in his neck . The sweetest of wines . The voice of Father O'Rourke rose behind me . " Corpus tuum , Domine , quod sumpsi , et Sanguis quern potavi , adhaeieat visceribus meis . " May Your body . Lord , which I have eaten and Your blood which I have drunk , cleave to my very soul . I turned to him , sated . " Look , Father . Look . I 've chosen . "
