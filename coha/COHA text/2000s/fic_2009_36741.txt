1 <br> Jack Palms walks into a diner just south of Japantown , the one where he 's supposed to meet Ralph . As he passes the Wait to Be Seated sign , he wonders if these things did n't come standard issue with Please at the start not too long ago , back when the world was more friendly and kind . <br> But Jack knows what Ralph and the rest of the people who come to a place like this would tell him : Fuck that . <br> The diner 's built out of an old cable car , with a lunch counter along one side and booths on the other . Ralph sits alone at the last table , eating , hunched over his plate , long brown hair hanging curly around his face , his blue-and-white Hawaiian shirt clashing with the ugly checked wallpaper . He has n't gotten any younger or prettier over the years : His pockmarked cheeks move like a rabbit 's , his eyebrows form a thick mustache over his eyes . He wears wide sunglasses , the kind blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . <br> Ralph smiles when he sees Jack . " Jacky boy , " he says , showing Jack the other side of his booth with a big hand , not getting up . " You look good . Like you added a little weight . " He winks . " In a good way . " <br> " Thanks . " Jack pats his rib cage . He calculates it 's been three years since he last saw Ralph . Three years and then the phone call this morning , asking Jack to come in on a deal . <br> " You see that game against the Mets ? " Ralph starts , saying no one should be allowed to pitch around Bonds , the steroids home-run machine , that the Giants lost because the Mets did just that . Ralph shakes his head . " I guarantee you : They pitch to Bonds , he puts that shit in the Bay . " <br> " Just coffee , " Jack tells the waitress , who 's come out from behind the counter . She stops with the brown-rimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Decaf , " it 's clear she 's not happy about having to go back for the other pot . <br> " And toast , " Ralph adds . " He 'll have a wheat toast , darling . " The waitress , pushing forty and only a few years from when the days on her feet and gravity will own her , smiles and tips her head . " Thank you . " He winks . When she 's gone : " You got to have toast or something . So they know we 're not camping . " He tilts his head , forking more waffle into his mouth . <br> " Just do n't eat it . " He shrugs . " I 'm buying . " <br> " Right , " Jack says . Next to Ralph 's untouched water , two butts half fill his ashtray : one coming in and one with his coffee , waiting for Jack and his food , Jack guesses . He 's a quarter into his waffle and has a side of eggs and bacon that he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : buttered it first , went liberal , and stayed away from the fruit flavors-no blueberry or apple bullshit . <br> " Listen , Jack . " Ralph barely looks up , cuts the next quarter waffle into strips . " I 'm real sorry about how that shit went down with Victoria . How you handling yourself ? " He looks up , pauses from eating . <br> Jack runs his finger over the rim of his coffee mug . " Getting by , Ralph . Thanks for your concern . " <br> " Because I feel for you about Victoria telling people you hit her . " He shakes his head . " That was n't good . " He looks at Jack , like he 's trying to get it all figured out right then and there . " You did n't , right ? " <br> " No , Ralph . " <br> " And that was n't cool that they pulled the money for your sequel , dumped the project . " He forks a big piece of waffle into his mouth . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the basics here , Ralph ? The big picture ? " <br> Ralph nods . " It 's a buy , " he says , mouth full , using his fork to point . " Easy and simple : a buy and a sell . One big trade , no small shit or breaking up of product . We each stand to make a couple thou for a few days ' work . " <br> " You said on the phone we 'd be set for good . " <br> Ralph shrugs . " Shit , Jack . I needed to get you down here to hear this , right ? " <br> Jack looks around the diner , thinks about how it 'd feel to just get up and walk out . But then he considers the two thousand reasons to stay and the guy from the bank calling this morning about his missed mortgage payments . <br> " Keep talking . " <br> A sip of coffee and Ralph cuts off some eggs with his fork and adds them to what he 's already chewing . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm trying to watch my cholesterol . " <br> The waitress comes back with the decaf pot and fills Jack 's cup until he stops her about an inch from the top . He 's glad Ralph does n't ask about the decaf , does n't want to explain that he had his coffee at home and knows a second cup will leave him too jittery to deal with Ralph 's shit . She drops off a small plate of dry wheat bread , lightly toasted , at the top of Jack 's placemat . Little pats of butter line the side of the plate , the kind you have to peel the paper off of . Ralph drops two bacon strips on top of the bread . " Make yourself a sandwich , " he says . <br> Jack adds a sugar to his coffee and stirs it with one of the diner 's dirty spoons , adding a half-and-half . " So what 's the who ? The when ? " <br> Ralph goes on eating . " The when is still up in the air , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The who you do n't need now . I 'd tell you , but it would n't mean anything . You 're too long out of this game . " <br> Jack nods , sits back in his chair , and looks at the little white mug of decaf , thinking about whether he should walk out . " Tell me why you need me . " <br> " Listen . You made that sequel , you 'd be in a whole different world right now , financially and otherwise . " Ralph holds up his hand , stopping Jack before he can tell him to shut up . " I know , " he says . " Enough . But I 'll just say I heard you 're touching down on your luck , that maybe you could use a little money . That 's why I called . " <br> Jack takes a bitter sip of coffee , puts the mug back down . " I 'm listening . " <br> " I need a side , a guy who can come along , maybe drive a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys want a nice time in the city . You still got the Fastback , right ? " Jack nods . " And that mug of yours can still get us past a few red ropes . More than mine anyway , probably more than any of the suckers ' I know . " <br> Jack lifts up a triangle of toast and looks at it , puts it back . With butter , maybe it 'd be all right , but plain it looks like warm cardboard . " You see my name in the papers lately ? " he asks . " No one gives a shit who I am anymore . " <br> " Exactly , my man . They see you , people do n't care , but maybe a small part of them remembers your face , knows you from the movie . I know it , you know it . That 's why you wear the hat . " He points to Jack 's baseball cap , the Red Sox World Series Edition that he 's taken to wearing when he comes into the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Oh , Jack Palms , you the man from Shake ' Em Down . ' Then sometimes it 's not good ; someone says , ' You the guy got addicted to smack and hit his wife . The one never made a second movie . ' Either way , bad or good , they like knowing you , recognizing someone they think is a celebrity . And we get the treatment we want . " <br> Jack does n't want to believe it comes down to this , to hear this is what people think of him , that he 's down to the point where these are his options . He 's been up in Sausalito for a long time now , two years of hiding away from the city , cleaning himself up , but he ca n't hide out forever , especially with his money from the movie running out . <br> Jack takes a deep breath . The flat surface of his coffee has no reflection . Bacon lies across his toast , grease soaking into the bread . He wonders how Ralph can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , how nothing 's changed , nothing 's come along and kicked his ass like the newspapers did when they came to take Jack 's picture in handcuffs . <br> " I apologize , Jacky . " Ralph puts his hands flat on the table , no longer eating . " But you know how it is . I know the papers got it wrong , but let 's be honest about the street : You not the man anymore , Jack , but you still got something . " <br> Jack sips his coffee : cold already and bitter . He takes a deep breath , lets it out slowly . " Okay , " he says . " I 'm in . " <br> Ralph nods , fluffs his eggs , and forks in a mouthful . " Good , " he says . " It 's Eastern Europeans coming in from out of town , Czechs traveling big-time , looking for a large chunk of blow . We meet them , take them out , show them The Guy , and see that the deal goes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they 'll pay big for that . " <br> " Relax . " Ralph stops eating for a beat , points his fork at Jack . " Why so skeptical ? It 's just a trade . Big trade . Do n't doubt , bro . " He forks up a big chunk of eggs , rubs it in the syrup . " I just need a backup . And for high rollers , I have to look good . That 's why I call you . When I say we do this , I mean we do the fucker . No stops . " He brings the fork to his mouth . <br> Jack nods . It 's been a long time since he 's worked anything . Maybe he 's just getting nerves ; maybe he just needs to be involved with something outside of his own house . He thinks about where he 'd be right now if Ralph had n't called : probably at the gym lifting or out on a morning run , things he needed at first to keep himself sane while he cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . <br> " When do we start ? " <br> Ralph laughs while chewing and catches some egg going down the wrong way . He coughs into the top of his fist . When he finishes catching his breath , he says , " That part you can just leave up to me , baby . " <br> 2 <br> Two days later , after Jack 's run his three miles and just started a coffee , Ralph calls again . He says to meet him downtown that night at eight , at the Hotel Regis on Stockton . Jack does n't know the hotel but knows the neighborhood around it : the city 's boutique shopping . The finest places : only designer names and upscale hotels . <br> Jack takes out a cigarette , his one of the day : the one he smokes with his cup of coffee in the morning , the one that reminds him where he 's been . He kicked the junk three years ago , one thousand sixty-six days exactly , and has n't had a drink in two years . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks out over the Bay while he smokes , through the huge kitchen windows that were the biggest selling point of the house , the thing Victoria fell in love with first . Now he 's used to the view , to seeing the tiny sailboats move about on the water while he eats . As he takes a long drag , he feels the familiar nausea and closes his eyes , eases into the comfort of his chair . The rest of the cigarette goes slowly , bringing the day to a crawl that Jack can appreciate now , knowing the afternoon will feature things he does n't know and might not be prepared for . <br> When he 's done , he snuffs out the cigarette , gets up and washes his hands , scrubs them vigorously with soap to remove any of the smell from his fingertips , knowing it wo n't ever work . He takes down the cereal and a ceramic bowl off the shelves that Victoria had installed when she remodeled the kitchen . <br> He skims the front page of the newspaper while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what Ralph 's going to get him into with this and whether it 's worth it . Compared to sitting around all day , there 's hardly a choice . Compared to losing the house and looking for an apartment he ca n't afford either , he 's ready to hit the shower and get dressed to go . <br> The phone rings and Jack waits it out , finally hears his answering machine beep . The plain voice of an agent from his bank comes on , the second call in as many days , asking Jack to call back , make an appointment to come in and discuss his loan . Jack knows what the bank knows-that he 's late on the second payment in a row now and does n't have the money . He 's just transferred the balance from one credit card to another , buying himself some time , but the bank wo n't wait much longer . <br> Out in the Bay , a steamer makes its way around Alcatraz , heading for the port of Oakland . <br> Jack dresses in jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long he 's been up here wearing sweats and tracksuits , going to the gym , and it feels good to be clean , dressed . Back in L.A. he dressed up for parties , went out to clubs all the time , had work to take care of . With Victoria , he 'd dress even nicer : tuck in , wear a suit jacket every once in a while . But that was back then . Even before the divorce , after her first time in rehab , they stopped going out , mostly just stayed at home to nurse their addictions . <br> He stops at the mirror in the living room before going out to the garage . This is where he usually puts on his Sox hat , but now he leaves it on the rack . He looks at himself in the mirror , runs his hand over the short brown hair that he cuts himself every couple of weeks with electric clippers , smoothes the skin over his face that he shaves clean now every couple of days . In L.A. , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goatee or something else whenever he wanted , shaved himself with an electric , and had a good time playing with the styles , but not now . Now he shaves with a razor , hot water , lather , and a badger brush . His face feels tight , the skin sensitive , but he takes his chin in his hand and looks at the side of his face , the bump on his nose from when he broke it playing football in high school . He 's still in there , he tells himself , the guy he 's known his whole life , alive and breathing , has the same looks that got him the movie , and has even added a little muscle since he made Shake ' Em Down , the movie where he drove the fast car , won all the fights , got all the girls . <br> Continues ...
