The last day of December , and the sky was going dark fast . Landon Guthrie ran his tongue around his teeth , tasting stale peanuts and bitter chocolate , the remnants of the energy bar . Pushing up the cuff of his glove , he checked his watch . The puff of breath that followed was a silent curse . In less than an hour , the season would be over and he had yet to get his buck . <br> His compound bow lay across his lap with the arrow nocked . He sat fifteen feet off the ground in his deer stand , looking down at a clearing . No fewer than three deer trails spilled into the circle of dead grass and fallen leaves . Less than half a mile behind him was a slushy stream , the animals ' drive-thru window for drinks . <br> The temperature had been dropping all day , but Guthrie was dressed for it -- a walking testament to the power of synthetics : Polar fleece . Thinsulate . Polypropylene . Nylon . Acrylic . Vinyl . He was windproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been doused with scent blocker and all the outer layers were in a Mossy Oak fall camo of branches and brown leaves . He did n't need the winter camo , which had branches against a white background , because the snow had yet to fly in northern Minnesota . <br> Glancing up at the sky , Guthrie wondered if they 'd finally get snow that night . If not a white Christmas , they could at least enjoy a white New Year 's Day . A hawk glided overhead in search of something to eat , and he wished the bird better luck than he 'd had . Time to start packing it in . He stood up on the platform and stretched , the bow still in his hand . <br> A rustling across the clearing froze him . A buck stepped out from between the trees . As the metallic taste of adrenaline bit the back of his throat , Guthrie willed himself to stay calm . He told himself not to look at the rack ; it would only make him more nervous . Ignoring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . <br> Fifty yards from the stand , the buck paused , surveying the clearing . Ran on . Thirty yards . Twenty . It stalled again ; something had spooked it . The buck took a ninety-degree turn to the right . Guthrie released the arrow , and the broadhead went in just behind the rib cage . <br> The buck sprinted from the clearing , seeking refuge amid the trees . Guthrie got out of his safety harness and took his time climbing down from the stand . Chasing the wounded deer immediately would make the animal run too hard , and increase the possibility of losing it . Better to give it a chance to lie down . <br> After strapping a headlamp on over his cap , Guthrie hiked into the thick woods behind the stand to track his prize . His breath hung in the air as he threaded between the trees . He was halfway between the clearing and the stream when he lost the blood trail in the growing darkness . The ground beneath his feet was as hard as concrete , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground ; it would have made the tracking easier . He stayed on a straight path , heading for the stream . Instinct told him that was where he needed to go . <br> At the edge of the water , Guthrie found her . " Jesus ! " <br> Guthrie stumbled backward , pulled his right glove off with his teeth , and fumbled around his clothing . Damn jacket had too many pockets . His fingertips finally touched the square edges of the cell and he pulled it out . He knew from experience that he could n't get a signal where he was standing , but he tried anyway . Hands shaking , he pressed the green button and eyed the screen , praying for bars . Nothing . <br> Phone still in his hand , he took a step forward . His headlamp illuminated the body and the area around it with a round , soft glow . Snow drifted down from the night sky , sparkling in the lamp 's beam like shards of glass . Flakes disappeared against her nightgown and melted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone and repeatedly pressed the green button , hoping for a miracle . Still no bars . He shoved the cell in his pocket . <br> He turned his back to the body , leaned a hand against a tree , and vomited peanuts and chocolate . As he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , he eyed the forest with fresh fear . Since he was a child , the woods had been his second home . He knew every ridge and ravine , every clearing , every hollow . Every marsh and slough . He was familiar with where the deer liked to hang out during deep snows and where they went during droughts . He could correctly identify the different hardwoods and pines . He could pick out the chatter of a gray squirrel and describe how it was different from the racket made by a red squirrel . <br> Now a monster had invaded his home . <br> He ran away from the stream , diving back into the trees . He aimed for his stand . North of that would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , his heart pounded hard in his chest and the cold night air burned his throat . <br> All that blood . That thing on her face . Who 'd done that ? What did it mean ? <br> No , he told himself . North . Worry about heading north and stop thinking about what was by the water . <br> What he 'd seen by the stream was a girl sprawled on her back in a blood-soaked nightgown . <br> On her forehead , a five-pointed star drawn in red . <br> CHAPTER TWO <br> Who 'd be calling first thing in the morning on New Year 's Day ? Instead of reaching for the phone , Bernadette Saint Clare pulled a pillow down over the back of her head . <br> " Is that your work cell , Bern ? " <br> With both hands , she pressed the pillow tighter and wished her guest and the ringing would go away . <br> " I think that 's the bureau calling , Bern . " <br> The ringing stopped . One wish granted . <br> She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . " Garcia . Shit . He 'll call back if it was important , right ? Want me to make you something ? Got eggs ? " <br> " No , " she said into the mattress . <br> She 'd had a little too much to drink at an unofficial bureau bash and had asked one of the tech guys to drive her home . He 'd spent the night on the couch . <br> A tech guy ! <br> She heard more stomping around the bedroom . This guy was enormous . <br> " I left some Tylenol and water by the bed , Bern . " <br> She sat up , hugging the pillow to her front . To make matters worse , it was B.K. , the most junior guy on TSS , the Technical Support Squad . They 'd been nicknamed the Tough Shit Squad because that 's what they said when turning down the other agents ' many requests for their help . Admittedly , he 'd helped her out last night . " Thank you for the ride , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her forehead felt ready to explode , and her mouth tasted like the inside of an old tennis shoe . <br> He sat down on the edge of the bed and folded his long arms in front of him . In his white T-shirt and jeans , he looked like a supersized toddler . " Breakfast ? " <br> She curled her legs up to her chest and struggled to remember his real name . Everyone called him B.K. , which stood for Big Kid . She scooped up the Tylenol and downed it with a hit of water . " This is all I want this morning , B.K. " <br> He got up off the mattress . " Everybody at the soiree sure had a good time . " <br> The soiree . A kegger held in somebody 's basement rec room . She hardly knew most of the other partiers , agents stationed in downtown Minneapolis . She worked solo out of downtown St. Paul . Assistant Special Agent in Charge Anthony Garcia was her only regular visitor and an occasional partner . He 'd been at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off , and caused her to down a few too many . She looked up at the kid and wished like hell she could ask : Did Garcia see us leave together ? Instead , she smiled weakly and said nothing , waiting for him to leave . <br> He shifted his weight from one foot to the other . " So ... " <br> " So ... " <br> He rocked back and forth on the balls of his feet . " I guess I could go home and feed my cats . " <br> " I guess you could , " she said , wondering why he was stalling . Did he expect a more elaborate expression of gratitude ? He was n't going to get it . <br> " Uh ... you have to give me a ride to my car . I drove your truck , remember ? " <br> She felt her face heat up . " Be down in a sec . " <br> " I 'll get some coffee going . " <br> " Good idea . " As she watched B.K. heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbored nasty thoughts about him . She should make him breakfast . <br> Her cell rang again , and she picked up . " Yeah . " <br> Garcia : " You sound like shit . " <br> As if he could see her through the phone , she hugged the pillow tighter to her chest . " I 'm fine . Sleepy . " <br> " Wake up fast , because I 've got a bad one , Cat , " said her boss , calling her by her nickname . " Really need you on it . It 's all ... political and messy . " <br> She leaned back against the headboard . " Tell me . " <br> " A teenage runaway was found dead in Paul Bunyan State Forest last night . Bow hunter came across the body while tracking a deer . She was ... sliced up . " <br> " Stabbed to death ? " <br> " Back of the head bashed in . " Garcia cleared his throat . " Let me back up . This girl was pregnant and the baby was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's sick . That is just fucking sick . So they found the dead fetus near the --  " <br> " The fetus is missing . " <br> Bernadette sat upright in bed . " Someone killed her , cut her open , and stole her baby ? " <br> " Yeah . " <br> " Did it survive ? Did the baby survive ? " <br> " A big question mark , " said Garcia . <br> " They took it , so it has to be alive , " she said . " Otherwise , why bother ? " <br> " Maybe they started out wanting a live baby , but who knows what they ended up with ? This was a very brutal , slipshod job . Vertical slice right through the navel . " <br> She switched the phone to her other ear . " There 've been other stolen-fetus cases . " <br> " There 's more . There was a five-pointed star --  " <br> " A pentagram ? " <br> " Yeah . There was a pentagram drawn on her forehead , apparently in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritualistic slaying cases for the bureau . " A cult thing ? " <br> " I do n't know what we 're thinking , " Garcia said . <br> " How 's this a bureau case ? " <br> " It 's because of the victim 's father , " said Garcia . " That 's where politics come into play . " <br> " I 'm listening . " <br> " Dead kid was Mag Dunton 's daughter . " <br> " Crap , " she said . <br> United States Senator Magnus Dunton , an independent from Minnesota , was not a friend of the FBI . While a chorus had accused the bureau of abusing civil liberties via the Patriot Act , Dunton 's voice had been the loudest . Not content to call for tougher limits on antiterrorism laws , the senator had come up with a scheme to dismantle the FBI and divide its duties among other agencies . Though his outrageous plan was n't being taken seriously on Capitol Hill , he 'd opened up a discussion regarding the bureau 's functions and its budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI field offices . <br> " I suppose Dunton does n't want us anywhere near the case , " she said . <br> " His people wo n't return my messages , but I think that 's a safe assumption . " <br> " Why not let the BCA take care of it ? " she asked , referring to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension , a state criminal-investigation agency . <br> " The BCA thought it was taking care of it , partnering with the locals . The sheriff up there , Seth Wharten , he 's a fishing buddy of mine . His people are the best . But it 's not my call . Headquarters handed me my marching orders this morning . Minneapolis Division is to take point on this thing . We 're treating it as a kidnapping . " <br> " Did they ask for me specifically ? " <br> Garcia sighed . " What do you want me to say , Cat ? They asked for you without asking for you . " <br> " I know how it works . " Bernadette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? This could be interesting . " <br> " Loads of fun . " <br> " I 'm sorry the man lost his daughter , " she said quickly . " What was her name ? " <br> " Lydia . " <br> " What was she doing way in the hell up north ? " <br> " Good question . " <br> " I 've got about one million others . " <br> " We can talk on the road , " he said . " Pack enough clothes to last awhile , including some serious outdoor gear . My cousin 's got a cabin on the Crow Wing chain of lakes and he said we could crash there . " <br> We . Quite a change from the night before . A couple of months earlier , they 'd come close to hopping in the sack together . They avoided talking about it now , acting as if it had never happened . Maybe that was why he was behaving inconsistently . Still , she was n't going to be the one to break the code of silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest clomping around downstairs . Getting B.K. to his car was going to take time . " I have to pull myself together , " she said . <br> " I 'll pick you up in an hour . We 're going to have to drive . Nothing can fly in this stuff . " <br> She looked out a window across from the bed . The snow was coming down thick . " I 'll be ready to rumble , " she said , kicking off the covers . <br> " Let 's hope like hell your hands and eyes feel the same way . " <br> Continues ...
