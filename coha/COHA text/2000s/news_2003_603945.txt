<p> The drive for 55 might as well be a Sunday drive , to listen to the Connecticut women 's basketball team . Those on the brink of an NCAA Division I record for consecutive victories in the sport seem to be the only ones removed from the hype . <p> " I honestly did n't know about it until a week ago , " says Sue Bird , who finished her UConn career last season as the point guard on the 39-0 NCAA title team . <p> " You know what , we do n't talk about it at all , " says All-American Diana Taurasi . " It 's not like there 's something on a board  --  No. 53 , let 's go get it  --  every game . There 's no sense of ' Let 's keep the streak alive . ' It 's ' Let 's do what we always do . Play hard . ' Hopefully good things come out . " <p> UConn can tie Louisiana Tech 's record of 54 games tonight against Seton Hall and break it Saturday against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team , ranked second in the nation , will be favored to run its streak to 59 before a Feb. 1 game against No. 1 Duke . <p> " It 's so far from my mind , it 's on another planet , " Auriemma said of the streak after a win against Rutgers last week . " I 'm just trying to get to the next game and keep ( Taurasi ) in one piece . " <p> Meanwhile , the Huskies chase Louisiana Tech . In 1980-81 , Tech went 34-0 and won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women title . The Techsters won their first 20 games in ' 81-82 on their way to a 35-1 season and the inaugural NCAA championship . <p> Tech 's twin titles came with nearly identical teams . Connecticut 's streak last year was built by Bird , Swin Cash , Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams  --  seniors who went 1-2-4-6 in the WNBA draft  --  plus sophomore star Taurasi . <p> This year it 's Taurasi , whose ankle and foot problems cause her to miss some practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it 's important if we get the record , " Taurasi says . " We 've done so much in the year-and-a-half it 's been going . This streak is not ours but everyone 's who has played here . If we break it , there will be a great sense of feeling for everyone . " <p> Raising the bar <p> Twenty years after Louisiana Tech 's record , UConn appears poised to set a tough standard . " If UConn can put another five or 10 victories on the board ( after 54 ) , it 's going to be awful hard to beat that , " says retired Tech coach Leon Barmore . " That 's going to be hard to duplicate . <p> " The thing that sets it up is the one great year . You have to have that awesome team that runs the table . " <p> Then , despite the likelihood of having lost key players to graduation , you 've got to get through about half of the next season without a loss . That 's a tall order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just hard , " Barmore says . " Say Duke runs the table this year . Well , next year can they run off 15 or 20 ? <p> Both Barmore and Tennessee 's Pat Summitt , the winningest coach in the women 's game , rule out Tennessee as a future candidate for the streak record because the Lady Vols consistently play the toughest schedule in the country . <p> " They do n't miss anybody , " Barmore says . " Geno 's played good people through the years , but I do n't think he 's played nearly the schedule , year-in and year-out , as Pat . " <p> Ahead of their time <p> While Connecticut can benchmark the quality of its starting lineup last year with four top WNBA draft choices , there was no such measuring stick for Tech . There was no WNBA . <p> " It was a different era , " says Baylor coach and former Tech star Kim Mulkey-Robertson . " You have more athletes at all positions now than back then . We 've made changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller ball , the three-point shot and more television coverage . " <p> Not that Mulkey-Robertson is conceding superiority . Tech 's stars included two-time All-American Janice Lawrence , a 6-3 center and ' 84 player of the year ; post Pam Kelly , the ' 82 player of the year ; All-American Angela Turner , a versatile player ; and Mulkey-Robertson , a 1984 Olympic gold medalist . The Techsters beat 23 top-20 teams during the streak . <p> " We were pretty salty , " says Mulkey-Robertson , a reserve in ' 81 . " Not only were the first five good , but we were one though 10 . Any of those 10 could have started . Our practices were more competitive than a lot of our games . " <p> One of the reserves was Debra Rodman , whose younger brother , Dennis , became an NBA star . " Just like Dennis : defense and rebounding , " former Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore says of Debra . " Scratch your eyes out . Cared little about shooting . Wanted to win no matter what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there was a WNBA then , a lot of those kids would have played . " <p> Coulda , shoulda , woulda <p> Louisiana Tech 's streak ended Jan. 29 , 1982 , with a 61-58 loss to host Old Dominion . The Lady Techsters then won their next 16 , including a second consecutive national title . <p> " If we could have got by Old Dominion and put 16 more on the board , you 're looking at a streak of 70 , " said coach Leon Barmore . " UConn would n't have beaten that . But it did n't happen . " <p> Hall of Famer Anne Donovan , recently named coach of the WNBA Seattle Storm  --  where she 'll be coaching Sue Bird  --  had 16 points , 16 rebounds and 12 blocks for ODU , plus two free throws with 11 seconds left . <p> " I can remember it to this day , " says Barmore , then associate to head coach Sonja Hogg . " Old Dominion was up one ( 59-58 ) , and we missed three shots . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it was new , fresh , exciting , entertaining . " <p> Close call <p> The Connecticut streak nearly ended at 50 on Jan. 4 , when the host Huskies beat Tennessee 63-62 in overtime . <p> " I 'm not going to lie , " says former Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore , who kept tabs on the game while playing golf . " I was pulling for Tennessee , sure I was . " <p> " I 'm not going to lie , " says Sue Bird , now with the WNBA Seattle Storm . " When they were down 10 points with two or three to go ( actually eight points with 5:15 ) , I thought , " Uh , oh , they are going to have to pray for a miracle . ' It actually happened . That was a great game . It was exciting . I was jumping up and down , getting into it . " <p> The Huskies were saved by Diana Taurasi , a 6-0 junior guard with a diversified game and flair for the dramatic . She scored 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-pointer to tie the score in regulation and the game-winner . <p> She subordinated her game last season , deferring to the seniors . This year Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma is begging players to help the point guard leading the team in rebounds . <p> " When you have a player like ( Taurasi ) and you have young kids , they need somebody to lean on , " says Villanova coach Harry Perretta . " The Tennessee game was a perfect example . She bailed them out . That 's her job . <p> " The Tennessee game defines them . They 've made the jump . If Taurasi stays healthy and they keep developing , they 're one of the four elite teams in the country , I think . " <p> Auriemma does not agree . He has seen freshman starter Nicole Wolff forced out of the lineup with a foot stress fracture ; he benched freshman Wilnett Crockett for poor practice habits ; he tinkers with lineups . " We are a long way from where we need to be , " Auriemma says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to others involved . I 'm not real good in handling carryovers year to year . You ca n't even talk about defending champions ; it 's a different team . <p> " A lot of the guys this year had nothing to do with last year . Diana 's the only one who 's played in all the games . I 'm more impressed that in the last nine to 10 years , there 's rarely if ever an upset involving Connecticut losing when we should n't . The streak is n't so much about the wins as the way we approach the game .
