San Francisco sculptor and artist Agelio Batle and his wife , Delia , wanted to raise their two young sons and also run his art business from home , so they began to look for a true live-work space - not just a developer 's make-believe live-work loft that 's too small for a substantial studio , much less a family . <p> It took months , but they found it on Potrero Hill , on the border between two distinct neighborhoods . To the south are small , peaked Victorians built for working-class families , and to the north are warehouses and factory buildings where those families presumably had jobs . " It was perfect . Not too residential and not too factory-like , " Agelio Batle said . <p> In fact , the two-story building , which had started out as a Victorian , was a bit of a mess . It had been altered over time ; marring its exterior were stucco and cheap plywood siding , an ugly front door , misaligned windows of varied shapes and sizes , and security grills . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since buildings zoned for commercial use can spread over an entire lot , it had been expanded into a 2,500-square-foot work space for offices for a dot-com company that failed . <p> Upstairs , there was only 900 square feet of living space , chopped into several small rooms . It was perhaps too small for four people , but after trying it out for several months while they worked on several - ultimately unaffordable - remodeling schemes with architect Ned White McCoppin Studios , San Francisco , they concluded that extra rooms were not necessarily the answer . <p> " They thought they could make their house interesting in other ways , and we decided to work with different floor plans instead of trying to get more square footage , " White said . <p> As their plans took shape , the owners and architects agreed that a spine wall in the downstairs could be eliminated to make the lower floor an open-plan work space for the Batles and their staff of eight , with distinct corners set up from back to front for sculpture , office work and exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living rooms and kitchen , making them into an open , flexible space . The original master bedroom , which opened to the back roof deck and garden , remains . By altering and expanding the bathroom into the back , they were able to rearrange the floor space to dovetail in a bigger bedroom for their sons . <p> Agelio Batle sculpts , from small chunks of graphite , delicate art objects that are sold in well-known museum stores , but when it came to new cladding for his house , he chose tough , industrial-strength , corrugated Galvalume , a sheet steel material galvanized and coated with aluminum , because it reflects the industrial character of the area . <p> To soften it , White and his partner , architect and contractor Derek Paprocki , added square metal windows with Douglas-fir frames on the interior and created a friendly , inset entry porch clad in cedar . Wooden French doors , through which passers-by can see the working studio , also add warmth . Custom Cor-Ten steel planters that the Batles loaded with showy , drought-tolerant succulents flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic - is exactly what the Batles wanted . While the facade materials are tough enough that they wo n't need to be painted or maintained annually for decades an inadvertent green dividend , the ways in which the architects have used them become decorative . The four square windows that now break up the front form a restful geometric pattern instead of the cacophony of shapes that was there . And , by turning the ribbed corrugated sheets vertically just above the door heights , the architects have added a subtle textural pattern . <p> " We did n't start out wanting to be green , " Agelio Batle said , but , by economizing , they discovered they were being green in unexpected ways . For instance , kitchen storage cabinets that he found in garbage bins and thrift stores and then assembled and painted red , just as sculptor Louise Nevelson might have done , are not just a sculptural accent - they were saved from going into the landfill . <p> Cork floors for sound absorption in the kitchen and living spaces are a wonderful renewable resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy-saving skylights both upstairs and downstairs simply made sense . The Batles chose water-based paints and fiberglass wall insulation that are formaldehyde-free . The individual Flor carpet tiles used in the bedrooms can be lifted , cleaned and reused . That 's impossible , or at least very difficult , to do when wall-to-wall carpets get stained ; they usually head straight to the landfill . <p> " The Batles No. 1 green idea was their decision to reuse their building and just add a little room upstairs , " Paprocki said . <p> Downstairs , before dismantling walls , Paprocki carefully noted which beams and posts were reusable and saved them . The mismatched concrete floors were simply unified by a thin coating of red Ardex self-leveling concrete . By resisting the temptation to repour that concrete slab just for aesthetics , the Batles saved money as well as a bit of the planet . <p> " What we loved about the building , " Batle said , " was the coziness upstairs . " Without the extra square footage they might have acquired had cost been no object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added advantage of an internal stairway to the downstairs - which becomes a large open space for the children to do homework and play in during the hours when the studio is shut - they have the ultimate in green design : a true family live-work space . graphite sculptures , drawings and paintings are available in several museum stores , including those at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , the de Young and Museum of Craft &amp; Design .
