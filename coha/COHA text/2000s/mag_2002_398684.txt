Barred from serving alongside other American units , Captain Hamilton Fish and the 369th Infantry found their World War I glory with the French . Photograph // Interview bv Jon Guttman TO DOCUMENT ONLY THE MILITARY CAREER of Hamilton Fish , Jr. , would be almost as ludicrous as concentrating on his career as captain of the Harvard football team . A New York congressman from 1920 through 1944 , Fish was best known as a rabidly anti-Communist statesman , a World War 11 isolationist and a bitter enemy of Franklin D. Roosevelt ( after 15 years of friendship ) . And even all those activities represent but a few facets of a man who had a long and eventful life . Nevertheless , Fish 's World War I combat career is , in itself , worthy of mention . He was among the last surviving veterans of the 369th Infantry , an all-black American regiment in which he served as a white officer . Barred by law from serving alongside white infantry units , the 369th was attached to the French 4th Army . In consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry regiment in the American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) . The then-Captain Hamilton Fish contributed more than his share to the unit 's outstanding record , as he recalled in this interview , conducted shortly before his death in 1991 at age 102 . Share with us your early years and education . I was born on December 7 , 1888 , in Garrison , New York , the only boy , with four sisters . My mother was devoted to me , but she died when I was 10 years old . My father was a lawyer and a strong Republican who ran for the New York State Assembly in the county of Putnam , which was a Democratic county and had turned Republican by 1896. 1 was devoted to my father and became as active in politics as he was , favoring the same views as he had , but I signed myself always as a liberal Republican . And you were a Harvard man . I went to school at Saint Mark 's School in Southborough , Massachusetts , a very large , magnificent school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three years  --  class of 1910 . I got my best marks in American history and was offered an appointment to teach there , but I did n't accept . I was captain of the Harvard football team , which was undefeated in 1908 . When Walter Camp wrote up the all-time All-America team in 1910-1915 , he put me on the team as a tackle . What drew you into the Army and the future 369th ? When World War I was confronting the American people , I had served in the legislature three terms as a Progressive Independent , not as a Republican . I began my military career in the 71st Infantry , New York National Guard . In 1915 1 went up to Plattsburg , New York , where they had a military officers ' camp , having been recommended by a number of prominent people . At the end of the second year , I was recommended for the rank of captain . I had studied , and at age 271 knew all the regulations . Well , this major , who seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank in his SOs , told me , " You 're too young to be made a captain . " I told him , " Sir , I 'm ready to take any test they have to offer , " but he only said , " I 'll find questions you ca n't answer-I 'll give you a test on cooking . " I did n't know cooking . He wanted to make me a first lieutenant , but I would n't accept that . So you looked elsewhere ? I returned to New York in disgust . There , I met Colonel William Hayward , who was in charge of a new regiment of volunteers . All to be black troops . He said , " I can make you a captain right away , if you 'll accept it . " I did . So , on June 26 , 1916 , I began raising troops for the 15th Infantry , New York National Guard . My captaincy became official on January 15 , 1917 . How did you approach this unusual assignment ? They were the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to be treated like human beings as we taught them how to perform the duties of regular soldiers . Not all of the troops were New Yorkers , but most of them came from New York , Westchester , Orange , Dutchess and Putnam counties . We drilled mostly at the Lafayette Dance Hall at 131st Street and 5th Avenue in Harlem . We had no rifles ; we had to drill with broom handles . Then , in August 1917 , we were shipped out-unfortunately to Camp Wadsworth , near Spartanburg , South Carolina . We got into a lot of trouble there because the Southerners resented Northern black troops . I wrote to Franklin Roosevelt , then the assistant secretary of the Navy , urging him to get us out of there-and he did . After 12 days at Camp Wadsworth , we were shipped back up to Camp Mills , N.Y . Photograph Above : The 369th Infantry Regiment machine-gun section on the march , May 4 , 1918 .

Opposite : A day later , the regiment on review at Maffrecourt , France . // Were all the officers in the 15th white ? Most of the officers were white . There was one black captain who had graduated from Harvard , a former track star named Napoleon Bonaparte Marshall . We had to appoint our own lieutenants and sergeants . Most of our sergeants were black , as was my first sergeant , Clinton J. Peterson , who came from Putnam County . After the war , he went on to be a lieutenant colonel and commander of the 369th . Who were some other standouts ? One of the greatest assets to the 15th Infantry in its formative days was 1st Lt. James Rees Europe , who in civilian life was leader of the Clef Club , one of the best musical bands in New York and backup to the popular dance team of Vernon and Irene Castle . With such a prestigious member , enlistments went up . We also enlisted Bert Williams , a star in the Ziegfeld Follies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sergeant Noble Sissle , lyricist to pianist and composer Eubie Blake . When and how did you get to France ? We got there on the SS Pocahontas , after several malfunctions and damage from a collision with a British tanker on December 15 , 1917 , which we repaired at sea . We finally landed at Brest on December 26 . I take it you did n't go immediately to the front . No . There was an old law against black troops serving with white troops , and the War Department did n't want to mix them , but we had no other black units with which to form a division . There were plans to form an all-black 93rd Infantry Division , but it never came to be . The all-black 370th , 371st and 372nd Regiments did arrive in France later , but like us , they were assigned to the French army . Then , as 1918 began , the 15th New York was redesignated the 369th U.S. Infantry , and its men were put to work unloading cargo from ships at Brest-until Colonel Hayward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , not stevedores ! " We were then given a choice : we could be shipped home , or we could be assigned to the French Fourth Army . The men were delighted - they did n't want to be sent home . They were keen for action . Certainly . That 's natural in wartime . They wanted to be a good regiment , to see good wartime service under fair conditions-and they got it . How did you and the French get along ? Very well . We joined the 161st Division of the Fourth Army on April 13 , 1918-thereby becoming the first regiment in U.S. history to serve as an integral part of a foreign army-and were assigned to Bois d'Hauza near Verdun . The Fourth Army commander , General Henri Gouraud , was a veteran who had served in Africa and had a high opinion of African troops . In the Fourth Army , the 369th fought alongside one Senegalese and two Moroccan divisions . In our first few weeks at the front , we served closely alongside French troops . I spoke French , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and Switzerland when I was 12 . Some of the other officers could also speak French . As for the troops , the French were glad to have them , and they were glad to serve . Our men , who played baseball , could throw grenades farther than the French , which amused the French a lot . Was the band still with you ? Oh , yes . They were sent to hospitals and locations all over France . They were the best musicians on the Western Front , and that 's no idle boast . Our band won all the competitions easily , under Jim Europe . As a captain , which company within the 369th did you command ? I led K Company , which was comprised of about 110 men . What kind of weaponry were you equipped with , American or French ? While we were attached to the French army , my men were equipped with French Chauchat rifles and ammunition , as well as French helmets and canteens . For backup fire support , the company had a lot of very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three rapid-fire 75mm guns that we brought out in case of a major attack . Did you have any training for chemical warfare , which had been in use at the front since 1915 ? Just before going to the trenches , I was sent to attend a three-day course in a French gas school , which was most interesting and instructive . More than one-half of all the shells fired by the Germans in March 1918 were gas shells , so you could readily appreciate how frightfully important this terrible feature of modern warfare was . Still is ! Now we call it chemical warfare , since gas , which is hard to control on the battlefield , is seldom used anymore-but the principle remains the same . I suppose you had to expect it all the time . Every soldier near the front kept his gas mask around his neck , ready for immediate use . Whether we all had them or not , I do n't know . A large percentage of the German gas shells was composed of yperite gas , which was particularly dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumes did not take effect for about 12 hours . But our gas masks provided absolute protection against infection of the lungs , if put on in time and worn long enough . Photograph This painting by H. Charles McBarron portrays the 369th Infantry Regiment " Hell Fighters " at Sechault , France , on September 29 , 1918 . The action earned the entire regiment the Croix de Guerre . // How did you get along with your men ? Well , to give you an idea of how I ran things , on one occasion one of my men went to sleep . He was a very good soldier , but he 'd had no sleep in 20 hours . The first I knew of it was when an old fat major came to me and said , " Do n't you know that one of your men should be tried and shot for being asleep on duty ? " I told him that I controlled the company , and that I would take care of it . I then sent the offending soldier back to his platoon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anybody could make him do anything that they asked him to . That soldier proved to be so honest that I later appointed him my secretary , in which role he served for a year . He was a lousy shot , but he was fearless . What was your first day in combat like ? In April 1918 , we took up positions in the trenches at Bois d'Hauza , where the French knew the Germans were going to launch a big attack that day . My company was sent to some fortifications on the front line , and that was the first fighting I knew , because the German artillery knew where the fort was , and opened up against it . One of my men was wounded , so I called up the next regiment-it was a mile back-which brought up support for the wounded man . As a stretcher team came to get him out of there , I was standing ten yards away when a 105mm shell came and landed in the middle of it . One of the stretcher-bearers was killed and three others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move my men five miles over to join the French , because we were too far east of the German attack . So we marched over to a French advanced headquarters , which was located only 50 yards from a German advanced HQ . That night , my men cooperated with the French when they sent out a raiding party to take some prisoners for interrogation . It was discovered , and came under fire from the two Germans it was approaching . One of the German bullets hit a bag of hand grenades that was being carried by one of the men and it exploded , killing three of them instantly . Unable to capture the Germans , the French killed them and one Frenchman brought back a helmet and a rifle , which he proudly exhibited the next day . On the way back , however , they came under a German barrage and three were wounded . The French lieutenant , who was badly wounded in the raid by a pistol shot in the head , walked back to our dugout and reported to the captain on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of his three men than about the bullet which was still in his head . Did you yourself fire at the enemy that day ? I had the pleasure of wasting at least 20 shots with my rifle on a German airplane that was reconnoitering our position at a low altitude . It was more a matter of practice than anything else , as it was seldom that an airplane going at a rate of 100 miles per hour can be touched by a rifle bullet . Now was a defensive trench line arranged ? The organization of the French system of defense was based on the principle of increasing strength in depth . The first lines were lightly held and were merely outposts for surveillance . My platoons in the first lines were stationed in combat groups , very strongly protected on all sides by numerous rows of wire entanglements and by barbed-wire doors , closing off both ends of the trench . Practically all fighting was done at night or in the early morning . What else do you recall ? The food , which was cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was plenty of it-some of my men never had better or more regular meals , which contributed to their excellent morale . Of course , everyone slept in their clothes and did not take their shoes off during their tour in the trenches , but the one thing I really disliked was the rats . There were innumerable rats of all sizes that ate up everything within smelling distance . They ate through the men 's pockets and musette bags , climbed over them at night , and were generally a pest . But were n't there other greater dangers ? The day after we arrived at the trenches , we had a most unfortunate accident . Three of my men were sleeping in a dugout 30 feet deep , when a grenade , which was hidden under a blue coat , was knocked down the steep stairs by a French soldier . It was set off by striking against one of the steps , and played hell with my men . A French lieutenant who went down with me fainted dead away at the sight of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wounded all over , but they were taken to the hospital and recovered . Was n't it during your time in the Verdun sector that Photograph henry johnson Just before dawn on May 14 , 1918 , a German trench  --  raiding party stealthily crept across no man 's land , toward the French trench line in the Argonne region . The party 's mission , as it was for so many such units on both sides of the lines , was to obtain one or two prisoners for intelligence purposes . An American infantry regiment had recently arrived in the French 4th Army sector , and the Germans wanted to learn more about it . And learn they soon would . Sergeant Henry Lincoln Johnson , a member of Company C of the 369th U.S. Infantry Regiment from Albany , N.Y. , was on outpost guard duty with Private Needham Roberts of Trenton , N.J. , when the trench raiders suddenly fell upon them . Roberts was knocked unconscious , but Johnson rushed to his rescue , and , using the butt of his rifle and a bolo knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the melee . Ultimately , the two Americans repulsed their attackers , killing four and wounding several others . Hamilton Fish , Jr. , who was then a captain commanding the 369th , recalled learning that Johnson , his blood up , actually pursued the fleeing Germans before collapsing from his own wounds . According to Fish , Johnson had 21 wounds in his body , but " refused to die , " and subsequently became the first American soldier in World War I to receive the Croix de Guerre with star and palm . It was for such actions as this one-known as " the Battle of Henry Johnson " in 369th circles-that the Germans came to refer to the black American soldiers as the " Hell Fighters . " American propagandists played up that title , along with the later , more noble sounding " Men of Bronze , " but the 369th men themselves preferred to call their unit " the Rattlesnake Regiment " and referred to themselves as the " Black Rattlers. " // a member of the 369th became the first U.S. Army soldier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another company , on May 14 . On that day , we were advancing against German machine guns over a stream about 10 yards wide . A French soldier was killed near my secretary-the one who was such a poor shot . He picked up the dead Frenchman 's rifle and shot a German 50 yards away . He became quite a hero with the company for that one lucky shot ! That night , a German trench-raiding party attacked another part of our defenses . Sergeant Henry Johnson and Private Needham Roberts fought off about 20 Germans . Johnson killed four of the Germans , drove off the rest and pursued them afterwards . Later , he was awarded a special medal and the French Croix de Guerre with star and palm . You seem to have led a charmed life out there . Were you ever wounded in combat ? I was wounded once , but I did n't claim it . While running over from battalion headquarters to inform the company of an impending gas attack on June 12 , 1918 , I got caught in some German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beehive of barbed wire , which cut me all up . I had to be patched up from that shell that blew me into that wire-rather an indirect wound . And I suppose , after you were bandaged up , you wanted to get back into action ? Absolutely ! The greatest irony of the 369th 's being segregated from the AEF was that it ended up in the thick of the last German attempt to drive on Paris . Were you there ? On July 8 , 1918 , my K Company was assigned to join two French companies defending an important hill against the expected German offensive . We were to protect the right flank of our position and counterattack at the sight of the first Germans . The L Company was also near the front line , while M Company was holding a village to our rear . I wrote home that day that I believed my company would be in the first position to resist the tremendous concentration against us , and that I did not believe there would be any chance of us surviving the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a post of honor , and had the greatest confidence in my own men to do their duty to the end . And your outfit was indeed among the first Photograph Opposite : Members of the 369th decorated after the war . Above : Preparing to move out in France in the spring of 1918 . Right : The regiment 's triumphant return to New York in 1919. // and hardest hit when the Germans launched their attack ? According to my first sergeant , Clinton Peterson , we were . The German offensive commenced with a massive artillery bombardment on the night of July 14 . Peterson and I waited in the dugout for the barrage to lift , then in came the first wave of attacking Germans . The enemy seemed to be all around us , coming from every direction . At one point , the Germans were 20 yards away . We did n't let them get anywhere with very much . When they moved , we fought them . According to the record , the French line reeled but held . But the 369th did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single member of the regiment taken prisoner . The Germans did overrun some of the 161st Division 's defenses , and the 369th re-took some of those French positions during the counterattack . The Germans also briefly captured two members of the 369th , but their comrades counterattacked and promptly took them back-along with their German captors . By 6:30 p.m. on July 16 , the German offensive had been stopped all along the Marne , and General Gouraud declared , " It has been a hard day for the enemy ; it is a beautiful day for France . " In September 1918 , you returned to the Meuse-Argonne sector . Were you a part of the 369th 's assault on Sechault ? I had just completed a staff school course at Langres , and was on a week 's leave when the 369th assaulted the town of Sechault on September 29 . As soon as I heard my regiment was going forward I cut short my furlough and went to join them . I arrived on September 30 and , as I reached a big , hollow basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed just a few yards from me . I went to headquarters and asked to join my company , which had just taken the village , to take food to them . You found them ? On the way , I saw a mound in which was buried one of my fellow captains of the 369th , killed by a shell or machine-gun fire . I also found my assistant there , shell-shocked . I ordered him to go back a couple of hundred yards , to our new headquarters , for a rest . He got excited , drew his pistol on me , and then fell over , unconscious . Just then , I heard what sounded like mosquitoes flying around my head . They turned out to be German bullets , and I took cover by the mound . Later , I got together about a hundred loaves of bread and found someone to help me carry it to the village . My men had already been fighting for six days on emergency rations , and had had nothing to eat all day . As we made our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 300 cavalry down that hollow valley through which I 'd passed . Machine guns shot down a lot of those poor men on horseback . We got into the village , distributed the food , and we had our own . I then reported back to the regiment , where we were again located by aircraft . Again the Germans dropped shells around us , wounding more men . Sounds like the Germans were determined to hold that town . Well , we took Sechault at 6 p.m. on September 30 , but it had cost the regiment 10 officers and several hundred men . First Sergeant Peterson reported that we 'd taken 30 percent casualties . We 'd practically ceased to exist as an organized combat unit . Yet , the 369th held onto the town , through 48 hours of machine-gun and artillery fire , repulsing every German counterattack , until we were relieved by a fresh battalion on October 2 , with my own unit placed in reserve . Sechault was declared secure on October 6 . According to the records , you were awarded the Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a second Croix de Guerre . Did n't you also later receive the Legion d'Honneur ? Yes , but that was much later ! In April 1987 , the French helicopter carrier Jeanne d'Arc arrived in New York , with Georges Fonte , French secretary of state for war veterans , and other officials , to commemorate the 70th anniversary of America 's entering the war . Ceremonies were held aboard her , honoring the nine surviving members of the 369th . Three Legions of Honor were awarded to me and two of the troops , Haywood Butts and William Layton ; the rest were awarded individual Croix de Guerre . Did the 369th get back to the front by the time of the Armistice ? Yes . After the war ended on November 11 , 1918 , the 369th became the first U.S. regiment to cross the Rhine into German **31;268;TOOLONG it did with the French Fourth Army . And it raised the New York state flag . At that time , the 369th had served 191 days at the front , and the entire regiment got the Croix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 369th Transportation Battalion in Harlem , still wear the green and red braid of the Croix de Guerre on their dress uniforms . Were you with them at war 's end ? No , I 'd transferred out of the regiment shortly before the Armistice . The commanding officer at Reims took a liking to me over my football background and talked me into acting as his assistant , with the rank of major-at that time he wanted to use me in a football game . After the war , he took me on a trip with him down the Rhine . He said : " Pershing is appointing me a general in Persia , to train their troops . If I 'm appointed , I want you to be one of my officers , to help train those troops . " I agreed , on condition that after a year I could go back to the United States , but it did n't go through because the British and Persians did n't want us to train their troops . So you missed the 369th 's triumphant return to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first to march down Fifth Avenue to Victory Square . I got back two months later , to march with a white regiment on April 27 , 1919 . In addition to later being a co-founder of the American Legion , I understand you went to some special trouble to see that the 369th 's contributions to the war effort did not go unrecognized by its own country . I lobbied for years to raise the money to help build a memorial chapel to the men of the 369th in France . I 'd say , " They 're entitled to this monument as much as anybody else . " Finally , in 1937 , the monument was built at Somme-Py . The bond and pride you and your men felt seems to have been mutual . They were great soldiers , with a great record . They had a " sixth sense " about what was going on , and they had a great sense of humor . They did their duty and more , as long as they could carry out their orders . And they were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are fighting for freedom and democracy , and you 're risking your lives .
