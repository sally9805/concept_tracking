Section : special focus : Changing Perspectives in Music Education <p> A half-century of debate about the philosophical basis for music education leads through functional , aesthetic , sociological , cognitive , and praxial schools of thought . <p> In the latter half of the twentieth century , the music education profession in the United States underwent considerable change in its philosophical foundations . From the launch of aesthetic education in the 1950s as a response to long-standing functional values to the emergence of praxial philosophy in the 1990s as a reaction to the aesthetic movement , the philosophical views guiding the profession have been shaped by the social , political , and cultural values of the times . This article recounts the evolution of these philosophies and offers an interpretation of the changes that took place . 1 The Emergence of Aesthetic Education <p> During the first half of the twentieth century , music education in U.S. public schools was associated with a variety of functional values that reflected music 's role in the social , physical , moral , and intellectual development of schoolchildren . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the cold war and the civil rights movement , led a number of influential music educators to become discontented with this state of affairs . These educators-including Allen Britton , Charles Leonhard , Bennett Reimer , and Abraham Schwadron-felt that music education needed a stronger theoretical foundation , a more academically credible ( and perhaps more respectable ) basis upon which to explain its importance in the school curriculum . They wanted this new foundation to be sufficiently comprehensive to unify members of the profession . They undertook to establish this new foundation on principles drawn primarily from aesthetics , the branch of philosophy that deals specifically with the arts ( see the sidebar for terms related to various music education philosophies ) . <p> The writings of John Dewey , Susanne Langer , Leonard Meyer , and other philosophers of the time served as cornerstones for these efforts . Langer had articulated a modernist vision of music as " a tonal analogue of emotive life " in her 1948 book Philosophy in a New Key and her 1953 book Feeling and Form. 2 Her words resonated strongly with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music being broadcast on radio and via the new medium of television . Meyer drew upon John Dewey 's philosophy of art 3 and Gestalt psychology to address issues of musical meaning , communication , value , and greatness associated primarily with Western art music in his books , beginning in 1956 with Emotion and Meaning in Music. 4 His work , too , met with wide acceptance . While the aesthetic perspectives of Langer and Meyer differ in important respects , both tended to focus primarily on works of music ( i.e. , compositions ) in their writings , regarding them as forms of art ; both employed conceptual vocabularies usually associated with Western art music ; and both emphasized the notion that all music is similarly expressive of human feeling . <p> Meanwhile , educational theory and practice were increasingly influenced by the field of psychology . Education theorist Benjamin Bloom and his associates grounded instructional practice in emerging psychological principles when they published their Taxonomy of Educational Objectives , the two volumes of which focused on the " cognitive " and " affective " learning domains respectively. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of " concept learning " in his writings , including his book The Process of Education , which came to have wide influence on instructional practices in all academic disciplines. 6 Accordingly , philosopher Nelson Goodman focused on the symbolic nature of the arts and on art education within a psychological framework. 7 Historian Michael Mark has described the rise of interest in psychology by educational philosophers at this time as the beginning of a " synergy between philosophy and psychology . " 8 <p> The important book Basic Concepts in Music Education , stemming from a Music Educators National Conference ( MENC ) - sponsored commission , emerged in 1958 , featuring chapters written by prominent music education scholars dealing with aesthetic concepts ; it served to launch the new philosophy in a formal way. 9 The publication of Charles Leonhard and Robert House 's 1959 college text , Foundations and Principles of Music Education , contributed further to establishing the profession 's acceptance of an aesthetics-based philosophy as its theoretical foundation . 10 <p> With a remarkably minimal amount of debate or discussion , music educators throughout the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the banner of aesthetic education , and MENC soon endorsed the new idea as well . Various well-publicized professional dialogues , such as the 1963 Yale Seminar , the Seminar on Comprehensive Musicianship in 1965 , and the 1967 Tanglewood Symposium , served to spread and popularize the notion of music education as aesthetic education . The establishment in 1966 of the Journal of Aesthetic Education , which rapidly became a forum for debate of philosophical issues in music education , confirmed the strength of the movement by the end of the following decade . <p> However , it is clear from the proceedings of the Tanglewood Symposium that , while most of the participants agreed that the aesthetic paradigm was suited to the changing societal values of the 1960s , some found it inadequate for accommodating musical practices of cultures outside the Western musical canon . The need for a " new aesthetic theory , " based on developments in technology , anthropology , and communication , was highlighted in the final report of the Symposium . 11 <p> Abraham Schwadron , one of the original proponents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he straddled the line in his writings between the need for the professional security that might be achieved through a unified philosophy and the realities of a pluralistic society . He advocated the adoption of a more relativistic philosophy , one that would emphasize " more inclusive understandings of socio-musical values and related educational means and ends . " 12 Schwadron 's perspective was shaped by the broad range of his scholarship , which drew from anthropology , ethnomusicology , and religious studies . <p> Other , more comprehensive philosophical perspectives were also available to music educators at that time , but they were either not pursued or not accepted by the profession at large . Theodore Brameld 's social reconstructionist view , perhaps most notable for its openness and flexibility , was passed over , likely due to its association with utilitarian educational outcomes. 13 The sociological approach developed largely by Max Kaplan 14 and then advanced by John Mueller may not have been embraced by the profession because of its association with " nonmusical " learning outcomes . Simultaneously , ethnomusicologists and cultural anthropologists like Charles Seeger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views were also not embraced. 15 It seems apparent that the profession was more comfortable holding to views grounded in aesthetic philosophy . In a sense , the new movement toward an aesthetic philosophy , as Mark has since observed , " was to have the effect of disassociating music education from societal goals , at least in the minds of many music educators. " 16 Unquestionably , the adoption of an aesthetic basis for music education resulted in a singular and cohesive philosophy for the profession , but it could be argued that its focus was narrow and would ultimately not accommodate shifting social and cultural realities . The Heyday of Aesthetic Education <p> With the groundwork laid for its full acceptance by the profession , the aesthetic education movement blossomed in the 1970s , beginning with the publication of Bennett Reimer 's landmark book A Philosophy of Music Education. 17 Reimer advanced the philosophical position of " absolute expressionism , " which he had adopted from Meyer 's theory of musical expression . This philosophical viewpoint , Reimer argued , provides a sound basis for " the claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all children . " 18 According to the absolute expressionist position , the meaning of a given musical work is primarily internal to that work ; the expressive emotional meanings evoked by the music " exist without reference to the extramusical world of concepts , actions , and human emotional states . " 19 Of primary importance is the notion that the relationships within a musical work alone are capable-in and of themselves-of exciting feelings and emotions in the listener . The meanings that particular forms of music carried within the social contexts in which they had originated were not considered . <p> One important result of Reimer 's book was that it brought into focus the relationship between philosophy and advocacy . In fact , the book launched a new phase of advocacy , in which the values of music in education were seen to evolve out of a particular philosophical position . Reimer later provided what was to become the most popular definition of aesthetic education , describing it in words soon adopted by music education advocates as " the development of sensitivity to the aesthetic qualities of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , a number of organizations undertook efforts to put the philosophy into practice . In 1971 , MENC and CEMREL ( the Central Midwestern Regional Educational Laboratory ) published Toward an Aesthetic Education , featuring papers by scholars dedicated to the development of the aesthetic movement in music education . 21 The aesthetic approach became increasingly evident in curriculum projects in the 1970s , including the CEMREL Aesthetic Education Program , the Cleveland Area Project , and Harvard Project Zero , among others . Textbooks were published based on the philosophy , most notably the 1974 basal series Silver Burdett Music , for which Reimer was a guiding author. 22 <p> Certain trends in education and psychology in the 1970s had an impact on the direction of the aesthetic movement . As economic changes caused policy makers to become more concerned with " the basics " in education ( raising questions of educational accountability , which led arts teachers to intensify arts advocacy efforts ) , educators emphasized outcome-based curricula , measurement of behavioral and instructional outcomes , and increasingly sophisticated quantitative research methodologies intended to facilitate curriculum development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music education at the time explored how the development of students ' aesthetic sensitivity affected their music learning and achievement . Educational leaders sought to draw links between psychology , educational psychology , and aesthetic education , applying the concept of taxonomy to music instruction , creating instructional objectives describing aesthetic behaviors and affective outcomes , and evaluating aesthetic education programs . Arguments from cognitive psychology-especially the results of related brain research then being published-assisted music educators in meeting increasing pressures to validate music in education . <p> Other trends in education influenced the direction of aesthetic education in turn , and music educators embraced many of these trends without fully considering their compatibility with the tenets of the aesthetic philosophy . Many music educators did not question their colleagues ' efforts to expand and clarify " aesthetic education , " but , rather , accepted the philosophy without full understanding of its curricular implications . New Directions : Challenging the Aesthetic Paradigm <p> While Reimer and others steadfastly continued to advance the aesthetic paradigm , 23 Abraham Schwadron and Douglas Lemmon argued that the paradigm was inadequate for accommodating cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse population of the United States . Schwadron emphasized that the aesthetic philosophy could not account for " the nature of the pluralistic society , the many musics , and the variety of accepted modes of thought . " 24 Lemmon saw the aesthetic philosophy as leading in two unacceptable directions : " Either we must believe that all musicians . work according to the principles of Reimer 's theory of art . or only those works and activities of musicians that can be shown to conform to the conditions laid down by Reimer 's theory of art can be justifiably included in . a curriculum in music . " 25 <p> Simultaneously , alternative views of the social value of music were being advanced by scholars outside the mainstream of music education in the United States . Ethnomusicologist John Blacking publicly strove to reconcile his own background as a classical pianist with his experiences studying the musical practices and beliefs of the Venda people of South Africa ( and others ) in a series of lectures entitled How Musical Is Man ? published in 1973. 26 Sociologist John Shepherd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the wider social reality of which they are a part in Whose Music ? A Sociology of Musical Languages ( 1977 ) . 27 Scholar-teacher Christopher Small , in his 1977 book Music , Society , Education , proffered a historical account of how the emergence of the scientific worldview in the Renaissance influenced the course of Western musical development . 28 He drew comparisons with non-Western musical practices , advancing a new way of considering the role of music in education . However , the work of these scholars had little or no immediate influence on mainstream music education philosophy . <p> Instead , philosophical writings during the early 1980s reflected a professional uneasiness stemming from a different source , as government economic policies began to channel funding away from the nation 's public schools , and arts education programs were cut back in many school districts . When music 's importance relative to other academic subjects began to be questioned publicly once again , historian Michael Mark took a long view of music education 's history , drawing a distinction between the profession 's utilitarian vs. aesthetic rationales. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with aesthetic educators voicing the merits of their chosen philosophy while others asserted that the " purposelessness of music " implied by that philosophy would likely doom the profession . 30 <p> Remarkably , writings on aesthetic education in the mid-1980s began to be challenged by those who had previously been centrally involved in advancing the movement . Writing in 1985 , Leonhard observed , " Current statements are often so vague and esoteric that few people can understand them , especially laypersons. " 31 Also sensing a deficit of substance in aesthetic arguments , scholar Richard Colwell noted in 1986 , " On the surface , music education continues to march forward under the aesthetic education banner , but it is searching for a new gonfalon that is not only more understandable to the general public but closer to what has become accepted educational practice . " 32 <p> Then , in a 1986 article on jazz education as aesthetic education , Canadian scholar David Elliott began discussing particular limitations of the aesthetic philosophy . Elliott was in a unique position to critique aesthetic philosophy , as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett Reimer at Case Western Reserve University . He first took issue with its emphasis on listening , observing that " jazz is a way of performing ; a way of being in music . Participation , not contemplation , is the hallmark of the jazz aesthetic . " 33 In a 1987 article , Elliott argued that the absolute expressionist basis of Reimer 's aesthetic philosophy could not account for the range of affective responses beyond those typically associated with Western art music . 34 Reimer responded incisively to these critiques , stressing the importance of aesthetic education as a fundamental concept that provided coherence for the profession . He warned that setting it aside would cast music education into a constant state of turmoil over its purpose . 35 <p> Meanwhile , new perspectives were emerging from the field of cognitive psychology , broadening the ways in which educators in general conceptualized music . In 1983 , Howard Gardner 's highly influential book , Frames of Mind , drew support from several decades of research in cognitive science to challenge the notion of human intelligence as a single general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrete human competencies or " intelligences " ( linguistic , musical , logical-mathematical , spatial , bodily-kinesthetic , intrapersonal , and interpersonal ) . 36 When one realizes that the human mind is partly musical ( i.e. , that the manipulation of sound is a natural and unique form of human cognition ) and that musical intelligence has relationships with other intelligences , it is but a single step for educators to recognize that encouraging and nurturing musical development may be an important responsibility of the public schools . Music education philosopher Keith Swan-wick also incorporated perspectives from cognitive psychology ( as well as sociology ) into his influential book Music , Mind , Education ( 1988 ) . 37 The Emergence of Praxial Philosophy <p> Along with a greater acceptance , appreciation , and celebration of cultural differences in the United States public forum in the late 1980s and early 1990s , music educators witnessed the flowering of a broader interest in philosophy within their profession . A Special Research Interest Group ( SRIG ) on Philosophy was officially established within MENC in 1990 ; an international symposium on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same year ; and the first issue of the Philosophy of Music Education Review was published in 1993 . The MayDay Group , an international community of theorists , also met for the first time in 1993 . They sought " ( a ) to apply critical theory and critical thinking to the purposes and practices of music education , and ( b ) to affirm the central importance of musical participation in human life and , thus , the value of music in the general education of all people . " 38 <p> In these venues , the most fruitful perspective emerging in contrast to music education as aesthetic education was praxial philosophy , which drew upon Aristotle 's notion of praxis as action rooted in practice rather than in theory . Philosophers Francis Sparshott and Nicholas Woltersdorff had opened the door to praxial considerations of music in Philip Alperson 's 1987 anthology , What is Music ? An Introduction to the Philosophy of Music . 39 Drawing a contrast to aesthetic philosophy , Alperson emphasized that considering different forms of art from a praxial perspective involved understanding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidenced in actual practice in particular cultures . " 40 <p> Informed by these and other influential writings of the time , in 1995 Elliott produced Music Matters : A New Philosophy of Music Education , in which he integrated multicultural and sociological perspectives on music within a praxial framework by asserting that members of different cultural groups throughout the world who make music are the practitioners of " a diverse human practice , " which he called " MUSIC . " 41 He asserted that a universal aspect of " musicing " ( i.e. , the behavior common among different forms of music-making as practiced around the world ) is that " musicers " 42 are typically engaged in what psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi called " flow " experiences . 43 Elliott argued that , as members of different cultural groups throughout the world develop skills and take on challenges in " musicing " in their respective traditions , they typically effect " flow " and thereby bring order to their own consciousness , engendering personal self-growth , greater self-knowledge , and raised self-esteem . On these bases , he affirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praxial philosophy has influenced thinking , writing , and teaching among music educators internationally . <p> Music education philosopher Thomas Regelski also affirmed the value of a praxial approach in thinking about music and music education , though his arguments and conclusions have differed in important ways from those of Elliott . Drawing upon the work of scholar Ellen Dissanayake and other thinkers , 45 Regelski has underscored that philosophical accounts of music and music education must extend beyond the Western art tradition to account for all forms of musical praxis . Advocating a curriculum that is open and validating of all forms of musical activity ( e.g. , recreation , entertainment , therapy , ritual , and ceremony ) , he has asserted that " to teach music properly is to teach . what in all the world music is good for . ' " 46 <p> In recent years , many scholars writing on music education philosophy have not engaged directly in the debate that has ensued between aesthetic and praxial philosophers , choosing instead to address issues surrounding musical practices in particular contexts . In her book In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminated several tensions presently impacting the profession . Among them , she distinguished between various conceptions of education , delineated the role of music in various sociocultural spheres , and offered a dialectical view of music education that highlighted the dilemmas facing the profession. 47 As the profession 's interest in sociocultural matters has increased , greater attention is being given to works like David Hargreaves and Adrian North 's The Social Psychology of Music 48 and John Shepherd and Peter Wicke 's Music and Cultural Theory , both published in 1997. 49 These books demonstrate the centrality of musical behavior in different societies and account for its embeddedness in the social and cultural processes of people 's everyday lives . Wayne Bowman fruitfully explores related issues such as moral growth , social transformation , and political concerns in " The Limits and Grounds of Musical Praxialism. " 50 <p> Nevertheless , a debate between the philosophers holding to aesthetic philosophy and those holding different praxial conceptions has continued to the end of the twentieth century and remains alive in the twenty-first. 51 For example , Bennett Reimer has just completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy of Music Education : Advancing the Vision , 52 and David Elliott is now editing Dialogue in Music Education : The Praxial Philosophy , a text intended to support his praxial philosophy-based writings. 53 Conclusion <p> This account of music education philosophy over the latter half of the twentieth century reflects historical changes well beyond the forum of music education . Numerous other far-reaching changes-including the escalation , decline , and end of the cold war , the emergence and continuing influence of the civil rights movement , and the attendant rise of multiculturalism in education-have contributed to fostering an ethic of acceptance and mutual interest among peoples of diverse cultural backgrounds . At the same time , interdisciplinary dialogues among scholars in anthropology , psychology , sociology , political science , and other disciplines have fundamentally altered the curricular content of these academic fields . ( See the sidebar for selected readings in music education philosophy . ) <p> From the beginning of this period , the " music education as aesthetic education " movement had numerous positive effects : It highlighted the distinctiveness of Western art music as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having academic content , thereby elevating the educational status of music and lending respectability to the music education profession . It provided a single conceptual basis upon which music educators could unite in their efforts to explain the importance of their subject in the curriculum . Thus , it helped to professionalize music education . In establishing a conceptual framework and a vocabulary to explain music 's meaning and value , the movement afforded a means by which teachers , parents , and administrators could discuss the importance of music in education , thereby supporting the profession 's advocacy efforts . <p> More recently , those who have brought praxial perspectives to the philosophical dialogue in music education have focused attention on different cultural forms of musical activity as significant human behaviors , challenging the Western art tradition 's focus on musical " works " as objects . These scholars have emphasized that philosophical accounts of music and music education must address the unique cultural characteristics of and affective responses associated with the multitude of musical traditions surrounding and impacting today 's schools . Informed by a variety of cultural perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educators to illuminate for their students the important role that different forms of musical activity play in everyday life . <p> At present , the nation 's cultural and musical diversity represents a significant challenge to those seeking to provide a unifying philosophy for the music education profession . Aesthetic and praxial philosophers have addressed this state of affairs in quite different ways . If controversy is an indication of vitality , the dialogue now taking place among these thinkers would seem to bode well for the future of music education . <p>
