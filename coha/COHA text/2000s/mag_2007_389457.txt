DREAM FISH I 'm enjoying your series on dream cruising destinations . I particularly liked the piece on fishing the Florida Keys ( " Only in the Keys , " May ) . When I lived in Delray , I always found time to spend at least two weeks each year casting lines in that extraordinary place . In fact , I caught my first tarpon in the Keys . Most people think spring and summer are the principal seasons for this species , but the fishing can be quite good in the fall , too . I was out with friends on an October day when I caught my fish . We were live baiting with one of the tarpon 's favorite meals , mullet . Perhaps you already know that tarpon take live bait in a couple of ways . Some fish will knock the bait right out of the water and then inhale it in midair . My fish was different . There was barely any disturbance at all , just a slight eddy on the water 's surface as the bait got sucked under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-foot long silver king explode from below . That was a special day for me , and I have the Keys to thank for it . Fred Austin Jackson , Miss . FAMILY TIME After reading about the Teshler family and the great times they have had on their cruiser ( " My Boat , " May ) , I started to think about how our Carver 360 has brought our family closer together . I 'm one of six children , ages 8 to 27 . My parents bought the boat in an effort to pull us together for more quality time . This is the first boat we 've ever owned , so the learning curve has been huge . We all share the responsibility of maintaining it , and we all look forward to the weekends when we can get out on the boat again . My oldest sister is married and one of my brothers is in college , so we do n't get to see each other as much as we 'd like , but the boat has a way of getting us all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives me the chance to spend more time with my younger brothers and sisters before they grow up . Laura Hornsby Cincinnati , Ohio STOP THEFT Regarding your story on how to stop theft for under $10 ( " How To , " January ) : Yes , installing an interrupt switch in line with the keyed ignition circuit is a plausible way to keep a thief from starting your boat . However , there is another way to interrupt the ignition . Use a switch to ground on the negative side of the coil . This will serve the same purpose but it wo n't disturb the original ignition circuit . Plus , a person who tries to hot-wire your boat will likely see the modification you made and then run . That thief may not look for an interrupt switch . Bill Sapielak Via email BEST BOATS So , you 're asking readers to weigh in on the best boat design of all time . I think it 's the Grand Banks 32 . With a 135-hp Ford Lehman diesel , it cruises at 8.5 knots , burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1964 to 1993 ; about half were woodies . My boat was launched in 1985 I bought her in March 1996 , and she 's been appreciating in value each year since . Look in any classified section and try to find one of these models for sale . You wo n't , because they 're so hot they sell by word of mouth . How many boats can you say that about ? John H. Logie Via email My vote for the best boat of all time would have to go to the Chris-Craft 57-foot Constellation . It was the last of the wood Connies , and if I 'm not mistaken , it was built in the early 1970s . The look and the lines of that model still give me the chills .
