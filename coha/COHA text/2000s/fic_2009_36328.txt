Prologue <p> Charlotte <br> February 14 , 2002 <p> Things break all the time . Glass , and dishes , and fingernails . Cars and contracts and potato chips . You can break a record , a horse , a dollar . You can break the ice . There are coffee breaks and lunch breaks and prison breaks . Day breaks , waves break , voices break . Chains can be broken . So can silence , and fever . <p> For the last two months of my pregnancy , I made lists of these things , in the hopes that it would make your birth easier . <p> Promises break . <p> Hearts break . <p> On the night before you were born , I sat up in bed with something to add to my list . I rummaged in my nightstand for a pencil and paper , but Sean put his warm hand on my leg . Charlotte ? he asked . Is everything okay ? <p> Before I could answer , he pulled me into his arms , flush against him , and I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dreamed . <p> It was n't until weeks later , when you were here , that I remembered what had awakened me that night : fault lines . These are the places where the earth breaks apart . These are the spots where earthquakes originate , where volcanoes are born . Or in other words : the world is crumbling under us ; it 's the solid ground beneath our feet that 's an illusion . * * * <p> You arrived during a storm that nobody had predicted . A nor'easter , the weathermen said later , a blizzard that was supposed to blow north into Canada instead of working its way into a frenzy and battering the coast of New England . The news broadcasts tossed aside their features on high school sweethearts who met up again in a nursing home and got remarried , on the celebrated history behind the candy heart , and instead began to run constant weather bulletins about the strength of the storm and the communities where ice had knocked out the power . Amelia was sitting at the kitchen table , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in six-foot drifts against the glass slider . The television showed footage of cars sliding off the roads . <p> I squinted at the screen , at the flashing blues of the police cruiser that had pulled in behind the overturned vehicle , trying to see whether the officer in the driver 's seat was Sean . <p> A sharp rap on the slider made me jump . " Mommy ! " Amelia cried , startled , too . <p> I turned just in time to see a volley of hail strike a second time , creating a crack in the plate glass no bigger than my fingernail . As we watched , it spread into a web of splintered glass as big as my fist . " Daddy will fix it later , " I said . <p> That was the moment when my water broke . <p> Amelia glanced down between my feet . " You had an accident . " <p> I waddled to the phone , and when Sean did n't answer his cell , I called Dispatch . " This is Sean O'Keefe 's wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The dispatcher said that he could send out an ambulance , but that it would probably take a while  --  they were maxed out with motor vehicle accidents . <p> " That 's okay , " I said , remembering the long labor I 'd had with your sister . " I 've probably got a while . " <p> Suddenly I doubled over with a contraction so strong that the phone fell out of my hand . I saw Amelia watching , her eyes wide . " I 'm fine , " I lied , smiling until my cheeks hurt . " The phone slipped . " I reached for the receiver , and this time I called Piper , whom I trusted more than anyone in the world to rescue me . <p> " You ca n't be in labor , " she said , even though she knew better  --  she was not only my best friend but also my initial obstetrician . " The C-section 's scheduled for Monday . " <p> " I do n't think the baby got the memo , " I gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She did n't say what we were both thinking : that I could not have you naturally . " Where 's Sean ? " <p> " I ... do n't ... kno  --   --  oh , Piper ! " <p> " Breathe , " Piper said automatically , and I started to pant , ha-ha-hee-hee , the way she 'd taught me . " I 'll call Gianna and tell her we 're on our way . " <p> Gianna was Dr. Del Sol , the maternal-fetal-medicine OB who had stepped in just eight weeks ago at Piper 's request . " We ? " <p> " Were you planning on driving yourself ? " <p> Fifteen minutes later , I had bribed away your sister 's questions by settling her on the couch and turning on Blue 's Clues . I sat next to her , wearing your father 's winter coat , the only one that fit me now . <p> The first time I had gone into labor , I 'd had a bag packed and waiting at the door . I 'd had a birthing plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery room . I knew it would hurt , but the reward was this incredible prize : the child I 'd waited months to meet . The first time I had gone into labor , I 'd been so excited . <p> This time , I was petrified . You were safer inside me than you would be once you were out . <p> Just then the door burst open and Piper filled all the space with her assured voice and her bright pink parka . Her husband , Rob , trailed behind , carrying Emma , who was carrying a snowball . " Blue 's Clues ? " he said , settling down next to your sister . " You know , that 's my absolute favorite show ... after Jerry Springer . " <p> Amelia . I had n't even thought about who would watch her while I was at the hospital having you . <p> " How far apart ? " Piper asked . <p> My contractions were coming every seven minutes . As another one rolled over me like a riptide , I grabbed the arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crack in the glass door . <p> Trails of frost spiraled outward from its point of origin . It was beautiful and terrifying all at once . <p> Piper sat down beside me and held my hand . " Charlotte , it 's going to be okay , " she promised , and because I was a fool , I believed her . * * * <p> The emergency room was thick with people who 'd been injured in motor vehicle accidents during the storm . Young men held bloody towels to their scalps ; children mewed on stretchers . I was whisked past them all by Piper , up to the birthing center , where Dr. Del Sol was already pacing the corridor . Within ten minutes , I was being given an epidural and wheeled to the operating room for a C-section . <p> I played games with myself : if there are an even number of fluorescent lights on the ceiling of this corridor , then Sean will arrive in time . If there are more men than women in the elevator , everything the doctors told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me even having to ask , Piper had put on scrubs , so that she could fill in for Sean as my labor coach . " He 'll be here , " she said , looking down at me . <p> The operating room was clinical , metallic . A nurse with green eyes  --  that was all I could see above her mask and below her cap  --  lifted my gown and swabbed my belly with Betadine . I started to panic as they hung the sterile drape in place . What if I did n't have enough anesthesia running through the lower half of my body and I felt the scalpel slicing me ? What if , in spite of all I 'd hoped for , you were born and did not survive ? <p> Suddenly the door flew open . Sean blew into the room on a cold streak of winter , holding a mask up to his face , his scrub shirt haphazardly tucked in . " Wait , " he cried . He came to the head of the stretcher and touched my cheek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I came as soon as I heard  --  " <p> Piper patted Sean on the arm . " Three 's a crowd , " she said , backing away from me , but not before she squeezed my hand one last time . <p> And then , Sean was beside me , the heat of his palms on my shoulders , the hymn of his voice distracting me as Dr. Del Sol lifted the scalpel . " You scared the hell out of me , " he said . " What were you and Piper thinking , driving yourselves ? " <p> " That we did n't want to have the baby on the kitchen floor ? " <p> Sean shook his head . " Something awful could have happened . " <p> I felt a tug below the white drape and sucked in my breath , turning my head to the side . That was when I saw it : the enlarged twenty-seven-week sonogram with your seven broken bones , your fiddlehead limbs bowed inward . Something awful already has happened , I thought . <p> And then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were made out of spun sugar . You were crying , but not the hitched , simple cry of a newborn . You were screaming as if you 'd been torn apart . " Easy , " Dr. Del Sol said to the OR nurse . " You need to support the whole  --  " <p> There was a pop , like a burst bubble , and although I had not thought it possible , you screamed even louder . " Oh , God , " the nurse said , her voice a cone of hysteria . " Was that a break ? Did I do that ? " I tried to see you , but I could only make out a slash of a mouth , the ruby furor of your cheeks . <p> The team of doctors and nurses gathered around you could n't stop your sobbing . I think , until the moment I heard you cry , a part of me had believed that all the sonograms and tests and doctors had been wrong . Until the moment I heard you cry , I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sean peered over their shoulders . " She 's perfect , " he said , turning to me , but the words curled up at the end like a puppy 's tail , looking for approval . <p> Perfect babies did n't sob so hard that you could feel your own heart tearing down the center . Perfect babies looked that way on the outside , and were that way on the inside . <p> " Do n't lift her arm , " a nurse murmured . <p> And another : " How am I supposed to swaddle her if I ca n't touch her ? " <p> And through it all you screamed , a note I 'd never heard before . <p> Willow , I whispered , the name that your father and I had agreed on . I had had to convince him . I wo n't call her that , he said . They weep . But I wanted to give you a prophecy to carry with you , the name of a tree that bends instead of breaking . <p> Willow , I whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and the whir of machinery and the fever pitch of your pain , you heard me . <p> Willow , I said out loud , and you turned toward the sound as if the word was my arms around you . Willow , I said , and just like that , you stopped crying . <p> When I was five months pregnant , I got a call from the restaurant where I used to work . The pastry chef 's mother had broken her hip , and they had a food critic coming in that night from the Boston Globe , and even though it was incredibly presumptuous and surely not a good time for me , could I possibly come in and just whip up my chocolate mille-feuille , the one with the spiced chocolate ice cream , avocado , and bananas brvlTe ? <p> I admit , I was being selfish . I felt logy and fat , and I wanted to remind myself that I had once been good for something other than playing Go Fish with your sister and separating the laundry into whites and darks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Capers . <p> The kitchen had n't changed in the years since I 'd been there , although the new head chef had moved around the items in the pantries . I immediately cleared off my work space and set about making my phyllo . Somewhere in the middle of it all , I dropped a stick of butter , and I reached down to pick it up before someone slipped and fell . But this time , when I bent forward , I was acutely aware of the fact that I could not jackknife at the waist anymore . I felt you steal my breath , as I stole yours . " Sorry , baby , " I said out loud , and I straightened up again . <p> Now I wonder : Is that when those seven breaks happened ? When I kept someone else from getting hurt , did I hurt you ? <p> I gave birth shortly after three , but I did n't see you again until it was eight p.m . Every half hour , Sean left to get an update : She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ankle might be broken , too . And then , at six o'clock , he brought the best news of all : Type III , he said . She 's got seven healing fractures and four new ones , but she 's breathing fine . I lay in the hospital bed , smiling uncontrollably , certain that I was the only mother in the birthing center who had ever been delighted with news like this . <p> For two months now , we had known that you 'd be born with OI  --  osteogenesis imperfecta , two letters of the alphabet that would become second nature . It was a collagen defect that caused bones so brittle they might break with a stumble , a twist , a sneeze . There were several types  --  but only two presented with fractures in utero , like we 'd seen on my ultrasound . And yet the radiologist could still not conclusively say whether you had Type II , which was fatal at birth , or Type III , which was severe and progressively deforming . Now I knew that you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly mattered : you would have a lifetime in which to sustain them . <p> When the storm let up , Sean went home to get your sister , so that she could meet you . I watched the Doppler weather scan track the blizzard as it moved south , turning into an icy rain that would paralyze the Washington , D.C. , airports for three days . There was a knock at my door , and I struggled to sit up a bit , even though doing so sent fire through my new stitches . " Hey , " Piper said , coming into the room and sitting on the edge of my bed . " I heard the news . " <p> " I know , " I said . " We 're so lucky . " <p> There was only the tiniest hesitation before she smiled and nodded . " She 's on her way down now , " Piper said , and just then , a nurse pushed a bassinet into the room . <p> " Here 's Mommy , " she trilled . <p> You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg crate with which they had lined the little plastic bed . There were bandages wrapped around your tiny arms and legs , your left ankle . <p> As you got older , it would be easier to tell that you had OI  --  people who knew what to look for would see it in the bowing of your arms and legs , in the triangular peak of your face and the fact that you would never grow much beyond three feet tall  --  but right then , even with your bandages , you looked flawless . Your skin was the color of the palest peach , your mouth a tiny raspberry . Your hair was flyaway , golden , your eyelashes as long as my pinkie fingernail . I reached out to touch you and  --  remembering  --  drew my hand away . <p> I had been so busy wishing for your survival that I had n't given much thought to the challenges it would present . I had a beautiful baby girl , who was as fragile as a soap bubble . As your mother , I was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wound up doing harm ? <p> Piper and the nurse exchanged a glance . " You want to hold her , do n't you ? " she said , and she slid her arm as a brace beneath the foam liner while the nurse raised the edges into parabolic wings that would support your arms . Slowly , they placed the foam into the crook of my elbow . <p> Hey , I whispered , cradling you closer . My hand , trapped beneath you , felt the rough edge of the foam pad . I wondered how long it would be before I could carry the damp weight of you , feel your skin against mine . I thought of all the times Amelia had cried as a newborn ; how I 'd nurse her in bed and fall asleep with her in my embrace , always worried that I might roll over and hurt her . But with you , even lifting you out of the crib could be a danger . Even rubbing your back . <p> I looked up at Piper . " Maybe you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traced a finger over the rising moon of your scalp . " Charlotte , " Piper said , " she wo n't break . " <p> We both knew that was a lie , but before I could call her on it , Amelia streaked into the room , snow on her mittens and woolen hat . " She 's here , she 's here , " your sister sang . The day I had told her you were coming , she asked if it could be in time for lunch . When I told her she 'd have to wait about five months , she decided that was too long . Instead , she pretended that you had already arrived , carrying around her favorite doll and calling her Sissy . Sometimes , when Amelia got bored or distracted , she would drop the doll on its head , and your father would laugh . Good thing that 's the practice version , he 'd say . <p> Sean filled the doorway just as Amelia climbed onto the bed , into Piper 's lap , to pass judgment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Amelia said . " And how come she 's dressed like a mummy ? " <p> " Those are ribbons , " I said . " Gift wrapping . " <p> It was the first time I lied to protect you , and as if you knew , you chose that moment to wake up . You did n't cry , you did n't squirm . " What happened to her eyes ? " Amelia gasped , as we all looked at the calling card for your disease : the whites of your sclera , which instead flashed a brilliant , electric blue . <p> In the middle of the night , the graveyard shift of nurses came on duty . You and I were fast asleep when the woman came into the room . I swam into consciousness , focusing on her uniform , her ID tag , her frizzy red hair . " Wait , " I said , as she reached for your swaddled blanket . " Be careful . " <p> She smiled indulgently . " Relax , Mom . I 've only checked a diaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had learned to be your voice , and as she untucked the fold of the swaddling , she pulled too fast . You rolled to your side and started to shriek  --  not the whimper you 'd made earlier , when you were hungry , but the shrill whistle I 'd heard when you were born . " You hurt her ! " <p> " She just does n't like getting up in the middle of the night  --  " <p> I could not imagine anything worse than your cries , but then your skin turned as blue as your eyes , and your breath became a string of gasps . The nurse leaned over with her stethoscope . " What 's the matter ? What 's wrong with her ? " I demanded . <p> She frowned as she listened to your chest , and then suddenly you went limp . The nurse pressed a button behind my bed . " Code Blue , " I heard , and the tiny room was suddenly packed with people , even though it was still the middle of the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... SO2 of forty-six percent ... administering FIO2 . <p> " I 'm starting chest compressions , " someone said . <p> " This one 's got OI . " <p> " Better to live with some fractures than die without them . " <p> " We need a portable chest film stat  --  " <p> " There were no breath sounds on the left side when this started  --  " <p> " No point waiting for the X-ray . There could be a tension pneumothorax  --  " <p> Between the shifting columns of their bodies , I saw the wink of a needle sinking between your ribs , and then moments later a scalpel cutting below it , the bead of blood , the clamp , the length of tubing that was fed into your chest . I watched them sew the tube into place , where it snaked out of your side . <p> By the time Sean arrived , wild-eyed and frantic , you had been moved to the NICU . " They cut her , " I sobbed , the only words I could manage to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally let go of all the tears I 'd been too terrified to cry . <p> " Mr. and Mrs. O'Keefe ? I 'm Dr. Rhodes . " A man who looked young enough to be in high school poked his head into the room , and Sean 's hand grabbed mine tightly . <p> " Is Willow all right ? " Sean asked . <p> " Can we see her ? " <p> " Soon , " the doctor said , and the knot inside me dissolved . " A chest X-ray confirmed a broken rib . She was hypoxemic for several minutes , which resulted in an expanding pneumothorax , a resultant mediastinal shift , and cardiopulmonary arrest . " <p> " English , " Sean roared . " For God 's sake . " <p> " She was without oxygen for a few minutes , Mr. O'Keefe . Her heart , trachea , and major vessels shifted to the opposite side of her body as a result of the air that filled her chest cavity . The chest tube will allow them to go back where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the words sticking in his throat . " You 're talking about brain damage . " <p> " It 's possible . We wo n't know for a while . " <p> Sean leaned forward , his hands clasped so tight that the knuckles stood out in bright white relief . " But her heart ... " <p> " She 's stable now  --  although there 's a possibility of another cardiovascular collapse . We 're just not sure how her body will react to what we 've done to save her this time . " <p> I burst into tears . " I do n't want her to go through that again . I ca n't let them do that to her , Sean . " <p> The doctor looked stricken . " You might want to consider a DNR . It 's a do not resuscitate order that 's kept in her medical file . It basically says that if something like this occurs again , you do n't want any extraordinary measures taken to revive Willow . " <p> I had spent the last few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it turned out , it was n't anywhere close . <p> " Just something to think about , " the doctor said . <p> Maybe , Sean said , she was n't meant to be here with us . Maybe this is God 's will . <p> What about my will ? I asked . I want her . I 've wanted her all along . <p> He looked up at me , wounded . And you think I have n't ? <p> Through the window , I could see the slope of the hospital lawn , covered with dazzling snow . It was a knife-bright , blinding day ; you never would have guessed that hours before there had been a raging blizzard . An enterprising father , trying to occupy his son , had taken a cafeteria tray outside . The boy was careening down the hill , whooping as a spray of snow arced out behind him . He stood up and waved toward the hospital , where someone must have been looking out from a window just like mine . I wondered if his mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was next door , even now , watching her son sled . <p> My daughter , I thought absently , will never be able to do that . <p> Piper held my hand tightly as we stared down at you in the NICU . The chest tube was still snaking out from between your battered ribs ; bandages wrapped your arms and legs tight . I swayed a little on my feet . " Are you okay ? " Piper asked . <p> " I 'm not the one you need to worry about . " I looked up at her . " They asked if we wanted to sign a DNR . " <p> Piper 's eyes widened . " Who asked that ? " <p> " Dr. Rhodes  --  " <p> " He 's a resident , " she said , as distastefully as if she 'd said " He 's a Nazi . " " He does n't know the way to the cafeteria yet , much less the protocol for talking to a mother who 's just watched her baby suffer a full cardiac arrest in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be DNR before there was brain testing that proved irreversible damage  --  " <p> " They cut her open in front of me , " I said , my voice quivering . " I heard her ribs break when they tried to start her heart again . " <p> " Charlotte  --  " <p> " Would you sign one ? " <p> When she did n't answer , I walked to the other side of the bassinet , so that you were caught between us like a secret . " Is this what the rest of my life is going to be like ? " <p> For a long time , Piper did n't respond . We listened to the symphony of whirs and beeps that surrounded you . I watched you startle , your tiny toes curling up , your arms open wide . " Not the rest of your life , " Piper said . " Willow 's . " <p> Later that day , with Piper 's words ringing in my ears , I signed the do not resuscitate order . It was a plea for mercy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : here was the first time I lied , and said that I wished you 'd never been born . <p> Copyright 2009 by Jodi Picoult <br> Continues ...
