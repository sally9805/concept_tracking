<p> In this excerpt from her new book , Rule Number Two : Lessons I Learned in a Combat Hospital , Heidi Squier Kraft , a clinical psychologist , describes the day  --  April 14 , 2004  --  that she and her medical colleagues struggled to save Cpl . Jason L. Dunham , a U.S. Marine who had sustained massive injuries when he selflessly threw himself on a grenade to shield his fellow soldiers from the blast . <p> Mass casualty . The two words hammered away at us , beginning that first day when we sat together on bleachers at Camp Pendleton , holding our empty sea bags in our arms . Mass casualty . <p> The words assaulted us after dark during those seven months in the desert . They shattered the nights of silence after we had collapsed onto our hard cots . We wondered each night if sleep would be interrupted by the echo of those two words yelled down the concrete corridors of our barracks . <p> When they came , they catapulted us into strange , trancelike nights that blurred the boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piercing the blackness . The two words even greeted us in the morning as we debriefed the evening 's experiences at staff meetings and medical rounds . We talked about the mass casualty , planned for it , ran drills pretending it was happening , and set up elaborate scenarios to make sure we would be able to function when we were totally overwhelmed . With two operating rooms , it did not take much . Any more than two surgical cases exceeded our limited field capacity . <p> One day in mid-April , nightmare became reality . Although our experiences to date with multiple patients at once had been called mass casualties , the term was redefined that day . <p> Right before lunch , I stood in front of the hospital in my flak jacket and helmet , taking a picture of one of my colleagues next to the sandbags and the ALPHA SURGICAL COMPANY red Marine Corps guidon . Chief Edmonson walked outside and approached me as I tucked the camera into the large cargo pocket in my pants . She whispered in my ear , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marines walking up to the hospital for routine medical or dental care . <p> " You mean for lunch ? " I asked , surprised . <p> She nodded . " This is n't for sure yet , but we may be getting 14 from Al Qa'im . " <p> I followed her inside . No sooner had I taken off my helmet than the distant thumping of a Black Hawk 's blades beat the desert air , audible even when they were several miles from the hospital . I swallowed and found the back of my throat had risen to form a hard lump . <p> Minutes later , the helicopters landed on our makeshift pad , one after the other , in a surreal moving image of black fuselage paint and blood-red crosses , setting down within huge tornadoes of tan dust . We waited inside , watching through the dirty glass doors , as medical corpsmen and Marines formed into groups of six to carry gurneys . <p> Dave , our OR nurse and a former Army Special Forces medic , coordinated litter bearers . His voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as he called their numbers , the teams ducked their heads and ran out to the birds . <p> One by one , each group of six men and women grasped the handles of the gurney , slid it out of the hatch of the Black Hawk , pivoted slowly , and brought the heavy , bandaged and bleeding patient back inside our hospital . <p> The corporal was brought in first . I drew in my breath as I saw him . The tube down his throat protruded awkwardly from his mouth . At his brief visit to a forward resuscitative surgical suite before he came to us , other medical personnel had placed this lifesaving artificial airway and applied what was now a blood-soaked bandage around his head . His eyes were shut , bulging from his face and giving his eyelids the appearance of swollen , bruised globes . His name , written in black ink on his bare chest , was Dunham . <p> His litter team took him to the SST first , and behind him other teams carried 13 other patients through the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of gurneys resting on the dusty tile floor , each with its litter bearers waiting to pick up their patients again and move them forward in line . Jess , a pediatric cardiologist , and his team of corpsmen worked fast on Cpl . Dunham , who had two obvious entrance wounds to the frontal lobes of his brain . <p> The Marine made no meaningful movement , and Jess gave the order that he be moved to the expectant ward . This is the combat medical term for the triage area where casualties who are too critically injured to be saved are placed . Most American doctors , even those with wartime experience , never become used to giving that order . I am not sure Jess ever truly recovered from it . <p> Our expectant ward appeared to have once been an old laundry room . Its cracking tiled floor surrounded a drain in the center of the room . Even a nonmedical person could figure out why we used that space . Here a patient could be moved away from the chaos of other casualties . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . <p> Our mass casualty plan assigned dentists and dental technicians to monitor the expectant ward . When I arrived , they were taking care of Dunham . I entered the room and spent a few minutes with them as they touched the corporal gently and spoke to him in soft voices . His litter rested on the floor , and they sat around him on the tile . Their legs were folded in uncomfortable positions and they shifted often to maintain circulation . At one point , one of our senior dental technicians , DT1 Graham , rose to change the bag of fluids and asked me to take the Marine 's hand that he had been holding . <p> I was immediately drawn to Cpl . Dunham ; I was unable to leave him . We told him that we were proud of him and that the Marine Corps was proud of him . The chaplain came in and we all bowed our heads as he prayed out loud , asking God to take this brave Marine into His arms . DT1 Graham went through the front pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut off and was stuffed behind his head on the gurney . We found the Rules of Engagement card for Operation Iraqi Freedom , which included some basic Arabic words for phrases like " Stop " and " I am an American . " He also carried a small , laminated map of Iraq . His dog tag no longer hung around his neck , likely a result of the blast that injured him . But as regulations required of all of us , his second tag was laced into his boot . <p> We learned his first two initials were J.L. and that he was Methodist . We guessed his first name might be John , or Justin or Jason . He was not wearing a wedding ring . In combat , that did not mean much , but we pretended it did . <p> We called him Cpl . Dunham as much as possible . We told him he was doing great . We waited , anticipating that his breathing would become labored and his heart rate would become irregular . <p> They never did . His breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I swore I could see it moving under the muscles of his chest . <p> Many long minutes later , I moved his arm . It had looked uncomfortable to me . He was a tall , muscular young man , and his elbow hung off the edge of the cot . I told him what we were doing , and together DT1 Graham and I picked up his arm and moved it closer to him , adjusting the straps that kept him balanced there . I continued to hold his hand , and as we moved his arm , I felt a distinct squeeze . He had squeezed a few times before , but only in short , reflexive twitches . This was different . His whole biceps muscle flexed as he squeezed . <p> I looked at my colleagues . We did n't breathe . He squeezed again , so hard that he pulled me toward him . <p> " Cpl . Dunham , " I said urgently in his ear . " Can you hear me ? If you can hear me , squeeze my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked up , making eye contact with DT1 Graham , DT3 Stirling , who was sitting across from me , and James , one of our dentists , who was standing in the corner . Everyone 's eyes looked the same : huge and hopeful . I looked at our company commander , who was lingering by the door . She ran for help . <p> The five physicians of the company arrived at the expectant ward in about one minute flat . Two stethoscopes were placed on his chest , and Mike , a family medicine doctor , looked up and said , " I 've got 72 beats per minute . . . sounds good to me . " Jess held open the Marine 's eyelid and flipped a light back and forth . Dunham moved his head in response and squeezed my hand again . Several of us cheered . " Get him out of here " came a shout from somewhere in the room . <p> Everything sprang into motion . Voices yelled for a litter team , and within moments their boots pounded down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensive care unit while the admin clerk called for an urgent surgical medevac . Karen , one of two nurses in the ICU that day , knew that he had been responding to my voice , and in a gesture of friendship I will never forget , she handed me surgical gloves and asked me to continue to hold his hand . He squeezed frequently then , maintaining a strong grip , especially when I told him he was going in a helicopter . I told him my friend Steve , one of our physician assistants and a former helicopter air crewman , would be going with him . I laughed out loud each time he squeezed . He moved his head and feet on command . The energy in the room was electric , and we could not help grinning hopefully at each other . The chaplain wandered back in , looking confused . I told him , laughing , that I thought this young man might need a different prayer . <p> We heard the roar of the Black Hawk landing outside . The ICU team strapped Cpl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took its handles , a seventh lifting his IV bag . I kept holding his hand . Steve started hand-ventilating him then , and we all moved into the passageway . It seemed that every person in the company lined those walls as we walked through them and out the double doors . I gripped Dunham 's hand tightly and kept talking , unable to control the manic hope in my voice . I told him the doctors and nurses at his next stop would take good care of him , that we would never forget him , and that I was proud of him for fighting so hard . We walked all the way to the helicopter . The Army flight medic met us at the hatch . He motioned the litter bearers to the holding rack . <p> And then I had to let him go . <p> The litter team loaded him in the bird , and we all ducked under the vortex of the rotor blades and backed away . The Black Hawk took off . I stood paralyzed in the light brown dirt , watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bright blue horizon . The Black Hawk was joined by an attack escort , and together they made a wide , circling turn over us and disappeared . I turned around . A large group of people had gathered around the back doors and stood in quiet awe . The rest of our patients were either in surgery or on the ward . We could stop for a moment . <p> I was suddenly aware of my body violently trembling at my knees . I raised shaky hands to my face without realizing I still had my gloves on . And then the tears came . <p> Excerpted from Rule Number Two by Heidi Squier Kraft . c 2007 by Dr. Heidi Squier Kraft . Reprinted by permission of Little , Brown and Company , New York , N.Y .
