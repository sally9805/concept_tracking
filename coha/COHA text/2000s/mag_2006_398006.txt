Young people jump headfirst into the Internet 's world <p> As a conversation unfolds among teenagers on an Internet message board , it rapidly becomes evident that this is not idle electronic chatter . One youngster poses a question that , to an outsider , seems shocking : " Does anyone know how to cut deep without having it sting and bleed too much ? " An answer quickly appears : " I use box cutter blades . You have to pull the skin really tight and press the blade down really hard . " Another response advises that a quick swipe of a blade against skin " does n't hurt and there is blood galore . " The questioner seems satisfied : " Okay , I 'll get a Stanley blade ' cause I hear that it will cut right to the bone with no hassle . But . I wo n't cut that deep . " <p> Welcome to the rapidly expanding online arena for teenagers who deliberately cut or otherwise injure themselves . It 's a place where cutters , as they 're known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trigger self-mutilation , encourage peers to seek medical or mental-health treatment , or offer tips on how best to hurt oneself without getting caught . <p> The conversation above , observed during a study of self-injury message boards , occupies a tiny corner of the virtual world that children and adolescents have aggressively colonized . Psychologist Janis L. Whitlock of Cornell University , the director of that study , and other researchers are beginning to explore how young people communicate on the Internet . The scientists are examining how various online contacts affect a youngster 's schoolwork , social life , and budding sense of identity . Evidence also suggests that the Internet has expanded the reach of health-education efforts to teens in distant lands and provided unique leadership opportunities to a global crop of youngsters . <p> New findings , including six reports in the May Developmental Psychology , indicate that the Internet holds a special appeal for young people , says psychologist Patricia Greenfield of the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . That 's because the Internet provides an unprecedented number and variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called social networking sites such as myspace.com . <p> The one constant is that teens take to the Internet like ants to a summer picnic . Nearly 9 in 10 U.S. youngsters , ages 12 to 17 , used the Internet in 2004 , according to a national survey conducted by the Pew Internet &; American Life Project in Washington , D.C. That amounted to 21 million teens , half of whom said that they go online every day . About three in four U.S. adults used the Internet at that time , Pew researchers found . <p> Teenagers , in particular , provide a moving target for Internet researchers , remarks psychologist Kaveri Subrahmanyam of California State University in Los Angeles . " By the time you publish research on one type of Internet use , such as blogging , teenagers have moved on to something new , such as myspace , " she says , with a resigned chuckle . <p> EXPRESS YOURSELF Cyberspace offers a bevy of tempting opportunities to pretend to be who you 're not . Yet teens do n't typically go online to deceive others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies . That 's not surprising , Subrahmanyam notes , since adolescents typically seek answers to questions such as " Who am I ? " and " Where do I belong ? " <p> Consider the self-injury message boards studied by Whitlock 's team . Five Internet search engines led the researchers to a whopping 406 such sites . Most of these attracted participants who identified themselves as girls between ages 12 and 20 . <p> On message boards , as in chat rooms , participants register as members and adopt screen names , such as " Emily the Strange . " In many cases , both members and nonmembers can view messages , although only members can post them . <p> Whitlock and her coworkers studied the content of 3,219 messages at 10 popular self-injury message boards over a 2-month period in 2005 . Many postings provided emotional support to other members . Participants also frequently discussed circumstances that triggered self-mutilation . These included depression and conflicts with key people in their lives . Some message senders detailed ways to seek aid for physical and emotional problems , but others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substantial minority of messages either discouraged self-injurers from seeking formal medical or mental help or shared details about self-harm techniques and ways to keep the practice secret . <p> Online teen chat rooms generally do n't have specific topics but , like message boards , attract a wide range of kids and present both helpful and hurtful communications . Subrahmanyam and her colleagues examined typical conversations at two online chat sites for teens . They monitored more than 5 hours of electronic exchanges selected at various times of the day during a 2-month stretch in 2003 . <p> On one site , an adult monitored conversations for unacceptable language . The other site was unmonitored . <p> More than half of the 583 participants at both sites gave personal information , usually including sex and age . Sexual themes constituted 5 percent of all messages , corresponding to about one sexual comment per minute . Obscene language characterized 5 percent of messages on the unmonitored site and 2 percent on the monitored site . <p> One-quarter of participants made sexual references , which was not unexpected given the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the chat rooms , however , all members were confronted with the minority 's sexual banter . <p> The protected environment of the monitored chat room resulted in markedly fewer explicit sexual messages and obscene words than the unmonitored chat room did , Subrahmanyam says . Moreover , the monitored site attracted more participants who identified themselves as young girls than did the unmonitored venue , which featured a larger number of correspondents who identified themselves as males in their late teens or early 20s . <p> Much of the explicit sexuality on the unmonitored site amounted to degrading and insulting comments , adding to concerns previously raised by other researchers that youths who visit such sites are likely to encounter sexual harassment from either peers or adults . <p> Subrahmanyam 's team also conducted in-person interviews with teens who had n't participated in the chat room study . The results suggest that only a small minority ever pretend to be other people on the Internet . <p> Intriguingly , teens who write online journals , known as blogs , often forgo sex talk for more-mundane topics , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2004 , she analyzed the content of 600 entries in 200 teen blogs . <p> Teen blogs offer an outlet for discussing romantic relationships and , especially for boys , disclosing hidden sides of themselves , says psychologist Sandra L. Calvert of Georgetown University in Washington , D.C. In a 2005 online report with David A. Huffaker of Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill. , Calvert described entries in 70 teen blogs , evenly split between bloggers who identified themselves as girls and as boys . The ages given ranged from 13 to 17 . <p> Bloggers routinely disclosed personal information , including e-mail addresses and other contact details , the researchers found . Half the blogs of both boys and girls discussed relationships with boyfriends or girlfriends . Ten boys , but only two girls , wrote that they were using the blogs to openly discuss their homosexuality for the first time . <p> " Teenagers stay closer to reality in their online expressions about themselves than has previously been suggested , " Calvert asserts . <p> NET GAINS Give a middle school child from a low-income household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child become a better reader . That 's the conclusion of a new study that highlights potential academic consequences of the so-called digital divide separating poor kids from their better-off peers . <p> A team led by psychologist Linda A. Jackson of Michigan State University in East Lansing gave computers , Internet access , and in-home technical support to 140 children . The mostly 12-to-14-year-old , African-American boys and girls lived in single-parent families with incomes no higher than $15,000 a year . The researchers recorded each child 's Internet use from December 2000 through June 2002 . <p> Before entering the study , these children generally did poorly in school and on academic-achievement tests . However , overall grades and reading achievement scores-but not math-achievement scores-began to climb after 6 months of home Internet use . These measures had ascended farther by the end of the study , especially among the kids who spent the most time online . <p> Participants logged on to the Internet an average of 30 minutes a day , which is n't much in the grand scheme of teenage Internet use : Teens in middle- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Only 25 percent of the children in the study used instant messaging , and only 16 percent sent e-mails or contributed to online chat . These low numbers probably reflect a lack of home Internet access among the kids ' families and friends . Also , their parents forbade most of the participating kids from contacting strangers in chat rooms . <p> Still , text-heavy online sites seem to have provided reading experience that translated into higher reading scores and grades , the researchers suggest . Although participants remained below-average readers at the end of the study , their improvement showed promise , according to Jackson and her colleagues . <p> These findings raise the unsettling possibility that " children most likely to benefit from home Internet access are the very children least likely to have it , " Jackson 's team concludes . <p> In stark contrast to their poor peers , wealthier middle school and high school students spend much of their time on the Internet trading instant messages with friends , an activity with tremendous allure for young people trying to fit into peer groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For teens , instant messaging extends opportunities to communicate with friends and expands their social world , Kraut suggests . He and his colleagues probed instant messaging in interviews with 26 teens in 2002 and in surveys completed by 41 teens in 2004 . <p> Instant messaging simulates joining a clique , without the rigid acceptance rules of in-person peer groups , in Kraut 's view . Each user creates his or her own buddy list . <p> Within these virtual circles , teens become part of what they regard as a cool Internet practice and , at the same time , intensify feelings of being connected to friends , even when sitting by themselves doing homework , Kraut says . <p> Still , Internet-savvy youngsters typically have much to learn about the social reach and potential perils of online communication , says education professor Zheng Yan of the State University of New York at Albany . <p> Yan interviewed 322 elementary and middle school students in a New England suburb . Participants also drew pictures to show what the Internet looks like and , when told to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people one would see there . <p> By ages 10 to 11 , children demonstrated considerable knowledge of the Internet 's technical complexity , such as realizing that Internet sites act as data sources for many computers . <p> Not until ages 12 to 13 , however , did youngsters begin to grasp the Internet 's social complexity , such as the large numbers of strangers who can gain access to information that a person posts publicly . Even then , the kids ' insight into the online social world 's perils remained rudimentary compared with that previously observed in adults . <p> Children and teens plastering personal thoughts and images on Web sites such as myspace.com " often do n't realize how many people have access to that information , including sexual predators , " Yan asserts . He encourages parental monitoring of Internet activities and regular discussions of online dangers with children . <p> WORLDWIDE PEERS Adolescents who form global Internet communities show signs of developing their own styles of leadership and social involvement , a trend that Northwestern University psychologist Justine Cassell and her coworkers view with optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community known as the Junior Summit , organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . University officials sent out worldwide calls for youngsters to participate in a closed , online forum that would address how technology can aid young people . They chose 3,062 applicants , ages 9 to 16 , from 139 countries . <p> Those selected ranged from suburbanites in wealthy families to child laborers working in factories . Computers and Internet access were provided to 200 schools and community centers in convenient locations for those participants who needed them . <p> During the last 3 months of 1998 , children logged on to online homerooms , divided by geographic regions . Members of each homeroom generated and voted on 20 topics to be addressed by the overall forum . Topic groups then formed and participants elected a total of 100 delegates to an expenses-paid , 1-week summit in Boston in 1999 . <p> Cassell 's group found that delegates , whom the researchers refer to as online leaders , did n't display previously established characteristics of adult leaders , such as contributing many ideas to a task and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more messages than their peers did , those who were later chosen as online leaders-regardless of age or sex-had referred to group goals rather than to themselves and synthesized others ' posts rather than offering only their own ideas . <p> Without in-person leadership cues such as height or attractiveness , online congregants looked for signs of collaborative and persuasive proficiency , the researchers say . <p> Outside the controlled confines of the Junior Summit , teens even in places where few people own home computers find ways to obtain vital Internet information . Ghana , a western Africa nation in which adolescents represent almost half the population , provides one example . <p> Researchers led by Dina L.G. Borzekowski of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore surveyed online experiences among 778 teens , ages 15 to 18 , in Ghana 's capital , Accra . <p> Two-thirds of the 600 youngsters who attended high school said that they had previously gone online , as did about half of the 178 teens who did n't attend school . Among all Internet users , the largest proportion-53 percent-had sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted diseases , nutrition , exercise , drug use , and pregnancy . <p> Out-of-school teens-who faced considerable poverty-ranked the Internet as a more important source of sexual-health information than the students did , the investigators say . <p> In both groups , the majority of teens went online at Internet cafs , where patrons rent time on computers hooked up to the Internet . <p> Internet cafs have rapidly sprung up in unexpected areas , UCLA 's Greenfield says . She conducts research in the southeastern Mexico state of Chiapas , which is inhabited mainly by poor farming families . <p> Small storefronts , each containing around 10 Internet-equipped computers , now dot this hard-pressed region , Greenfield notes . Primarily young people frequent these businesses , paying the equivalent of about $1 for an hour of Internet surfing . <p> " Even in Chiapas , adolescents are in the vanguard of Internet use , " Greenfield remarks . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : HELLO OUT THERE . New research probes various ways in which children and teenagers use , and are affected by , the Internet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
