Section : family healthy home Here 's how to benefit from the season 's best-tasting , most nutritious staples <p> Your favorite fruits are out of season , and the last really good tomatoes are a fading memory  --  but that does n't mean you ca n't have tasty , healthy meals . By restocking your kitchen with fresh winter produce and canned , dried , and frozen foods , you can eat well when most people have resigned themselves to take-out pizza and peaches in syrup . <p> " People mistakenly perceive winter as a nutritional black hole , when actually there are so many healthful foods , including produce , available , " says Zonya Foco , RD , author of Lickety-Split Meals and the host of Zonya 's Health Bites , which will premiere on PBS this spring . <p> Some produce even tastes better now , Foco says . Many leafy greens  --  grown in southern spots such as Florida  --  are sweeter when it 's cooler . There are fewer bugs around this time of year , so edible plants cut back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce , including winter squash , root vegetables , apples , pears , and citrus , are harvested in fall and are tastier now than in spring or summer . Even in the bleakest winter , you can find frozen and dried fruits  --  the best of them more nutrient dense than hothouse fresh . And do n't forget canned tomatoes . They pack three times the lycopene ( key to eye and prostate health ) found in fresh . Winter is also an ideal time to enjoy warming , fiber- and nutrient-rich bean dishes and cooked cereals . <p> So put down that take-out menu . Here 's how to fill your fridge , freezer , and pantry shelves with the pick of the wintertime crop . <p> <p> Winter squash Butternut and acorn squash are great sources of the cancer-fighting antioxidants alpha- and beta-carotene . Cut them in half and bake face down , with 1/2 cup of water added to the baking dish , at 375F for about 45 minutes . Or , peel , cube , and steam for 15 minutes . " There 's also canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soups as it is in pies , " says Foco . <p> <p> Root vegetables Look for rutabagas and turnips , which , like broccoli , are cruciferous vegetables , replete with cancer-fighting isothiocyanates . Cook them just as you would potatoes . Another winter pick : beets , which get their jewel-red color from betalains , compounds that have been shown to protect your heart . Comfortably familiar carrots and sweet potatoes supply three to five times your daily requirement of vitamin A in a single serving . <p> <p> Cooking greens Leafy greens are so nutritious that the National Cancer Institute recommends eating them daily . They provide lutein and zeaxanthin , which protect your eyes from cataracts and macular degeneration . And the cruciferous ones  --  cabbage , kale , mustard and turnip greens , and Swiss chard  --  are also rich in those aforementioned isothiocyanates . Just wash , cut off the tough bottom stems , and with water droplets clinging , saute until limp in olive off seasoned with garlic , ginger , or other spices . <p> <p> Winter salad greens Winter arugula , grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any other time of year . Watercress is another delicious cold-weather star . They 're both nutritious and cruciferous . And watercress is rich in a particularly potent cancer-fighting isothiocyanate known as PEITC . These two peppery greens also work well ( for most tastes , separately , rather than together ) in a stir-fry , casserole , or soup . <p> <p> Select frozen veggies " Vegetables are flash frozen at the peak of ripeness so they 're often more nutritious than the fresh stuff that 's been languishing in the produce bins , " says Foco . Go for Asian stir-fry or other mixes to capture the widest variety of healthful nutrients . Your pick should include one or more of the following : broccoli , carrots , cauliflower , and brussels sprouts . For a fun change of pace , try edamame ( young , green soybeans ) . <p> <p> Canned tomatoes and tomato sauces They 're the foundation for an endless variety of stews , soups , and pasta sauces . <p> <p> Fall fruits with staying power Apples and pears , along with grapefruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . Grate antioxidant-packed citrus peel into fruit salads , rice dishes , and muffins . <p> <p> Dried fruit Dried cranberries are among the best sources of proanthocyanidins , powerful antioxidants that also help prevent urinary tract infections . A 1/3-cup serving confers the same protection as roughly 8 ounces of cranberry juice cocktail . Dried plums ( aka prunes ) are among the fruits ranked highest in antioxidants , USDA research shows . And 1/4 cup of apricots supplies three-quarters of the daily requirement for vitamin A. Just remember : A serving is usually 1/4 cup , because dried fruits are calorically , as well as nutritionally , dense . <p> <p> Choice frozen fruits Like veggies , fruits are flash frozen at their ripest . Your best-tasting and most nutritious bets : berries ( loaded with antioxidants ) and mangoes ( with beta-carotene ) . Toss 1/2 cup each of blueberries and raspberries into a smoothie , or add to pancakes and breads . <p> <p> Whole grain cereals Look for whole grain oats , wheat , amaranth , quinoa , or brown rice . The nutritional payoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phytochemicals . There might be a weight loss payoff , too : One study found that people who ate oatmeal felt less hungry . Bolster your calcium intake by using equal parts fat-free or 1% milk and water to cook . Impart a creamier consistency by letting the grain and the liquid warm up together , rather than stirring the grain into the hot liquid . <p> <p> Beans Staples in hearty soups and chilis , dried beans are superlative sources of iron , fiber , and heart disease  --  fighting folic acid . Some , such as white , great Northern , and navy , are also respectable sources of calcium . There 's nothing wrong with using canned beans ; just rinse to rid them of excess sodium . Or try reduced-sodium brands . <p> <p> Soups and broths They 're not raw ingredients , but they 're so versatile , you can use them as if they were . Try the creamy  --  but not fatty  --  vegetable-based butternut squash , portobello mushroom , broccoli , and tomato soups sold in resealable paper cartons by Pacific , Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat couscous , greens , and canned beans , and simmer for a few minutes . Serve with a little grated cheese . Cook veggies and grain pilafs in broths for added depth of flavor . " The vegetables will taste like they 've been braised in butter , " says Foco . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Frozen can be more nutritious than fresh <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Janis Jibrin , RD <p> <p> Janis Jibrin is a freelance writer and registered dietitian in Washington , DC . <p>
