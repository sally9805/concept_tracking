Photograph Who goes there ? An adult snowy owl-the most powerful owl in North America-does n't like humans invading its space . Photograph After feeding the owlets their fill of lemmings ( top left ) , Nuk and Mr. Holt race back to the nesting site . // Two all-terrain vehicles bumped and splashed across the Alaskan tundra . Mounds and puddles stretched for miles and going was slow . Nuk Harcharek 14 , was in front , hoping he could find the spot again . Biologist Denver Holt followed with their precious cargo-three young snowy owls . He hoped it was n't already too late . Found in the Tundra Three days earlier , Nuk and two friends-Jonas Ahsoak and Jens Hopson , both 15-had gone duck hunting near their Barrow , Alaska , homes . As they crossed the tundra in their ATV 's , they spied three young snowy owls . " It was n't very smart , but we decided to take them home and raise them , " Nuk said . The chicks were four or five weeks old , about the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks went in a bag ; Jens put the other under his jacket . When the boys got to Jonas 's house , they put the birds in an empty footlocker and fed them caribou meat . The next morning , Jonas 's mother , Eunice Akpik , noticed a stick holding the footlocker lid open . She yelped when she saw the owls , and quickly slammed the box shut . " What did those boys do now ? " she grumbled . After scolding Jonas , , she called a veterinarian . The vet picked up the chicks , made some phone calls and eventually took the birds to Denver Holt . Mr. Holt is a wildlife biologist and presidents of the Owl Research Institute in Montana . He was spending the summer in Barrow studying  --  you guessed it-snowy owls . Chowing Down First , he fed the babies food their parents might give them-lemmings ( mouselike rodents ) and pieces of duck . Then Mr. Holt located Nuk , who volunteered to help return the birds to their nest " But we had to do it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks gone , the parent owls might leave the area . " Nuk found the nest site , but as Mr. Holt feared , the owl parents were nowhere in sight A Flash of Wings Photograph Adult owls keep watch as Nuk and Mr. Holt place the owlets in a crevice to keep them out of the wind . // " I have an idea , " said Mr. Holt , who knew that if the parents were nearby they would come quickly if they saw their babies ' wings flash . " Let 's chase these chicks around to get their wings flapping . " The chicks flapped . And with the black-and-white pattern of the wings acting as a signal , the owl parents soared in within a minute . While the adult owls swooped and scolded , Nuk helped Mr. Holt band the babies , allowing Mr. Holt to identify them for later study . Then they set the chicks free . Soon , the parents were bringing food . " Great , " said Mr. Holt . " Now let 's leave them alone . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue and was relieved that he had n't gotten into big trouble . He also learned a valuable lesson-do n't mess with wildlife . And he was happy about the rescue for another reason : " Those baby owls would have been a real pain to take care of , " he said . TAKE NOTHING BUT PICTURES Most people venturing outdoors will eventually come across wild animals that appear injured or abandoned . Usually , say wildlife experts , the best course of action is to do nothing . Here are guidelines wildlife officials often suggest : Do n't assume young animals have been abandoned . Their mother ( or even both parents ) may be nearby . For example , female deer often bed down away from fawns so they do n't attract attention to the babies , and adult birds may be absent from the nest because they 're off finding food for the young . Do n't touch wild animals . It is O.K. , however , to put baby birds gently back in their nest if they have fallen out . Do n't hang around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals alone . Do n't ever take wildlife babies home to raise . Wild animals require much more care than dogs or cats . Many species never become tame . What 's more , taking wildlife home is often illegal . If you find an injured animal or know for sure that a young animal 's parents are dead , call wildlife authorities and let them handle it . <p>
