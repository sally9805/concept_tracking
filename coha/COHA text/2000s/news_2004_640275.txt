<p> At first glance , trying to weigh the impact of the losses of Shannon Sharpe vs . Keith Burns to the Broncos would seem to be a rather lopsided endeavor . <p> The latest talking ( and talking , and talking ) head on CBS ' ' The NFL Today , ' Sharpe is a likely Hall of Famer , a tight end who set league records for receptions , yardage and touchdowns at his position . Burns , the new linebacker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , on the other hand , had just four tackles when playing the position for the Broncos during the 2003 season . Even in his particular area of expertise , special teams , he had but 24 stops . <p> However , the seemingly endless chasm between the two narrows considerably inside the Denver locker room , that private area , which for any NFL team on a daily basis may have as much to do with its fortunes as how well the first-round draft pick pans out . <p> ' A person like that , a locker-room leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a special-teams guy , ' said Byron Chamberlain , one of five players vying to replace Sharpe on the field . ' He keeps the continuity of the team , the attitude of the team , right . ' <p> In that sense , as the Broncos partake in their minicamps and quarterback camps and rookie camps , there 's more going on than learning the team 's terminology . With the departure of Sharpe , Burns and Ed McCaffrey , to name a few , the Broncos also are trying to determine who will emerge as team leaders for the 2004 season . <p> Unlike back in the day , when players and teams were wedded forever , that process has become a yearly proposition . Instead of retirement , which is what sent Sharpe to the broadcast booth , free agency and the NFL salary cap are now more likely to be the reasons leaders change teams . <p> Just two years ago , safety John Lynch was a mainstay on a record-setting Tampa Bay defense that routed Oakland in Super Bowl XXXVII . This spring , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buccaneers , unwilling to pay his $ 4 million salary , released him after 12 seasons with the team . <p> ' I 'm an idealist ; I thought I had a chance to finish my whole career in one spot , and that appealed to me because it is so unique in this day and age , ' Lynch said . ' But you 've seen it so much in this league , to Jerry Rice and Junior Seau and Emmitt Smith , that you know no one 's immune to it . ' <p> Indeed , new Tampa Bay general manager Bruce Allen rocked the team 's core , also releasing another All-Pro defender , Warren Sapp , who 'd spent his entire 10-year career with the Bucs . Sapp signed with the Oakland Raiders ; Lynch decided to come to Denver to help solidify a potentially talented secondary . In the process of doing that , Lynch may find himself helping the entire team jell . <p> ' We have some guys here who know how to get it done ; they 've done it a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said wide receiver Rod Smith , one of the Broncos ' leaders on offense . ' When you put those guys with a lot of other guys who think the same way , you ca n't do nothing but get better , because it rubs off on the guys who come in . <p> ' Take a guy like Lynch ; you 've never heard anything bad about the guy . You know he 's a fierce competitor , he 's playing hard every snap . There 's no way you can go wrong getting a guy like that . <p> ' And my thing is , the other guys who are playing on his side of the ball will learn from him , but the players on my side of the ball will learn as well . The younger guys are saying , ' You think this guy just got here ? ' No , it was n't only his skills but his attitude . He put time in the film room , in the way he handles himself on and off the field . ' <p> Answering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the best definition of leadership he 's heard through the years is someone ' who makes those around him better , someone who makes those around him reach heights they did n't feel they could accomplish . ' <p> That sounds like the perfect definition for New England 's Tom Brady , who has led the Patriots to two Super Bowl victories in the past three seasons . The fact that Brady was a sixth-round pick is part of the reason he 's been so inspiring to teammates . More germane is the position he plays , quarterback . <p> ' Quarterback is the only position that comes with an automatic leadership role ; everybody else you have to earn that spot , ' said Smith , who overcame the long odds of making the NFL as an undrafted player and became one of the league 's elite . <p> In his second season with the Broncos , Jake Plummer said he will feel more comfortable taking charge . <p> ' After having a year under my belt , and having a pretty solid season , going to the playoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the guys I can get it done when they needed it to get done , that gives you the ability to come out more and be a leader , ' Plummer said . <p> Smith said a player other than a quarterback can begin the process of becoming a leader just because he 's able to get out onto the field and perform . <p> ' Ashley Lelie has a certain level of respect because of what he 's done on the field , so younger guys come in , they look up to him in a certain light , ' Smith said of the wide receiver who will be going into his third season . ' But as he produces more , that leadership will go from being in a small setting , not only younger offensive guys respecting you and following you , but into defensive guys , special team guys - everybody 's looking at you as a guy who can help us get to the top . ' <p> Chemistry , camaraderie <p> Having earned the mantle , the next question is , how does one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal style . Some , such as Michael Jordan , did it by setting exacting standards with his play , then at times belittling teammates who did n't strive to match his work ethic . Others , such as Burns , wield tremendous influence simply by hanging out with the fellas , using humor to keep players loose or providing an outlet for them to vent when frustrated . <p> That approach ca n't be underestimated in today 's NFL . <p> ' It 's hard to keep the camaraderie together on a team , ' Brocnos linebacker Al Wilson said . ' Guys are coming and going so much , it 's kind of like when you get comfortable with a guy , he 's gone . The teams where guys come together as a unit - the Patriots are a prime example - are the teams that win Super Bowls . ' <p> Thus the importance found in this time of year . Minicamps and daily weight-lifting sessions can be the NFL 's version of Outward Bound-teambuilding exercises designed to foster togetherness and finding out what makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no problem getting in a player 's face . <p> ' I tell them how it is . I 'm gon na come to you straightforward , ' he said . ' If I do n't think you 're playing hard or practicing hard , I 'm gon na say something to you . ' <p> But not until he has a feel for how a particular player operates . <p> Similarly , although he played on one of the NFL 's all-time great defenses , and has a Super Bowl ring and five Pro Bowl appearances to use as cachet , Lynch is taking a low-key approach to his likely emergence as one of the Broncos ' leaders . <p> ' I think that 's what they 're expecting of me ; I think now , especially with Shannon out , there 's an extra void there , ' he said . ' But it 's something you ca n't force when you come to a new spot . I 've been around places where people come in and say , ' We did it this way , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick ; it goes in one ear and out the other . What you have to do and what I 'm trying to do , is show them first . <p> ' If it 's talking about running to the football , you have to run to the football every time . You have to be yourself , and if you see something you have to address it , but I think there 's nothing worse than someone talking and they 're not doing it on the field . ' <p> That , agreed defensive end Trevor Pryce , creates a backlash that carries long-term implications . <p> ' As for me trying to bring someone up to do their job , I do n't think you should be here if you need that - I do n't think you belong in pro football if you need someone to get you going , ' he said . ' I 've always believed that , everybody has to take care of their job , and getting all hyped up and foaming at the mouth does n't make you a good football player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth . <p> ' Sometimes you say , ' Yo , let 's go man , you 've got ta make that play , ' but I do n't think you berate anybody or make yourself bigger than them . At some point , you 're not going to play well - it 's happened to me , it 's happened to Rod - sometimes you just do n't play well and that 's part of the game . So what does it look like to him when you berate him for not playing well and then you go out there and stink ? That just makes you look bad .
