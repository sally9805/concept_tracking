<p> The publicist promises 20 minutes on the phone with Renee Zellweger . Then she cuts it short after 12 . So you wo n't get all the " Bridget Jones 's Diary " dirt here . But you will read about Zellweger having to smoke " poopy-doody " ciggies . <p> Texas native Zellweger , who turns 32 on April 25 , caused a stir when she was cast as the quintessentially British , hard-drinking , hard-smoking but far-from-hard-bodied singleton on a woozy comic quest to find her prince and lose 20 pounds . To do justice to the best-selling novel 's heroine , she packed on those pesky extra pounds , took dialect lessons , and even worked incognito as a trainee in the public relations department of the London publishing house Picador . . . where no one ever recognized her as the star of " Me , Myself &; Irene " and " Nurse Betty . " <p> On the phone Zellweger has a voice soft as a baby 's giggle , with most of her sentences ending on an upward lilt  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In honor of her breakthrough role in " Jerry Maguire , " it 's tempting to say she had me at hello . But I wo n't . ( Though she did . ) <p> Renee Zellweger : Hey what 's going on ? <p> SM : Hey , how are you ? <p> RZ : Great ! <p> SM : Well , since we 've only got 20 minutes ( editorial note : HA ! ) , forgive me in advance for probably asking you all the same questions you 're already sick of answering . <p> RZ : I 'll try to be creative . <p> SM : So what have people asked you about more ? The weight gain , or the accent ? <p> RZ : It 's about 50-50 . But personally , on the street it 's about the weight . <p> SM : Was it ever a chore , or uncomfortable , putting it on ? <p> RZ : You know , it was probably as much fun as a work obligation could ever be . It was kind of great to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my responsibility . But it just becomes part of the day ; it 's maintenance . You go to work , rehearse , block the scene and eat your weight-gain protein shake . <p> SM : Are you a smoker yourself ? <p> RZ : No ! <p> SM : So what were you smoking in the movie ? <p> RZ : I was smoking poopy-doody sticks . They were the worst-smelling , obnoxiously vile , revolting friend eliminators I 've ever experienced . They were relationship killers . I do n't know what they were , they were so noxious . In a room full of 200 extras at the Tate Modern ( museum ) , no one blinked an eye until I lit up . <p> SM : Were you a fan of the book ? <p> RZ : Very much so . It 's so well-written . If you look at it on the surface , it looks like a simple concept . But imagine how many people would have put you straight to sleep , trying to document , with humor , their daily experiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this part is for me ? " <p> RZ : Well , I read somewhere a hundred years ago that it would be made by this English company , and made in England , and they had a list of English actresses who might play her . And I thought that seemed right . It did n't even occur to me that I might play the part . It seemed like , not my world . <p> SM : So how did you land it ? <p> RZ : A phone call . Yes ! Believe me , I was as surprised as anybody . My manager called and asked if I 'd ever heard of Bridget Jones . I thought he was looking for a recommendation for the book . But I got on the first plane to England and met with ( director Sharon Maguire ) and the producers . We sat down and worked together for a couple of days and discussed whether or not the character and her experiences translated over the sea . And whether or not I got it  --  did I get who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , with a little work and a lifestyle change , would it be possible for me not to destroy her . If I was going to be the person who brought down Bridget Jones , if I was going to ruin her , I was n't interested . I did n't want to be the one . It was grossly self-preservationist . <p> SM : How long were you in England , all told ? <p> RZ : I went in at the start of February to have meetings , and started working with Barbara Berkery , my wonderful friend and extraordinary ( dialect ) coach . Then I went home in August , then back to England . And we wrapped a few weeks ago . It was pretty much a solid year . <p> SM : Ever get homesick ? <p> RZ : Oh , you bet  --  homesick , friend-sick , puppy-sick , cat-sick . My girls , the critters . I have one of each . <p> SM : What kind of dog do you have ? <p> RZ : Oh , God , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very popular . <p> SM : I love the opening credits , where you 're singing along to " All by Myself . " <p> RZ : Oh , great . That was fun . I do n't know , but maybe doing it at the end of filming , away from your friends and family , and dog and cat , it was n't so hard . It was pretty relatable . It was sadly appropriate for me at the moment . <p> SM : Have you ever had Bridget-like feelings about Smug Marrieds and Singletons ? <p> RZ : I 've always felt like the third wheel  --  who has n't ? But it 's not on my list of requirements for happiness . I think I 'm going to be OK regardless . I love going out by myself . I 've always been a bit of a loner . So I kind of do n't have the same perception of what that means . It means a different kind of happiness to me . It does n't mean that happiness is conditional upon having ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people might object to the idea that you can only find happiness through romance ? <p> RZ : I think it depends on where you are in your life . It depends on how many times your mom and dad said , " Would n't it be great if . . . " or " You should really try to . . . . " And I did n't have that . It was n't a particular experience I related to . But I do understand it . <p> SM : I heard that when you were working incognito at the publishing house , no one ever recognized you . <p> RZ : Is n't that sad ? That 's so sad . I was so excited about that on the first day . Then it was like , " Wait a minute . " But that was fine , it made it a more authentic experience . What I saw and learned and experienced was invaluable . And in terms of not being recognized , hurray . Because that means it worked . <p> ( The publicist speaks up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more question . ) <p> SM : You know , I may be one of the few people who ever saw you in your " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " movie . <p> RZ : Oh , great ! You did ? <p> SM : Yeah . And when you were running around in your prom dress , screaming , did you ever think in a million years you 'd be onscreen one day with Morgan Freeman and Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise and Hugh Grant ? <p> RZ : You know what ? I was just so excited that someone had taken a leap of faith and given me an opportunity to play the lead in a movie . I was just learning at that point . Every experience I have , I kind of say , " thank you " in the moment . That 's plenty  --  that 's more than plenty . <p> SM : OK , I guess I have to let you go . <p> RZ : OK . It was nice talking to you . You sound like a very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> RZ : Bye ! <p> ( Postscript : She had me at goodbye , too . ) Director Sharon Maguire ( left ) and Renee Zellweger discussed in pre-production meetings how an American could play such a quintessentially British role. / ALEX BAILEY / Miramax Pictures
