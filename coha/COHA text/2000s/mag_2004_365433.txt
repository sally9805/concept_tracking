A trial of the cholesterol-lowering statin drug Lipitor last March found that high doses lowered patients ' levels of LDL ( the " bad " cholesterol ) and also reduced their heart-attack risk . That 's why the results of a new study on similarly high doses of the statin Zocor are so disappointing . In the 4,500patient study , published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association , patients taking high doses of Zocor fared no better than a low-dose group in terms of heart-attack risk , despite low LDL levels . Why ? Perhaps because Lipitor works not just by lowering cholesterol but also by reducing inflammation , something Zocor ca n't do as well .
