They will not see me move . They will not see me move , " Abigail whispered to herself , although her whole body cried out to shift her legs and ease the pain as she sat straight and still in the stocks . Her legs burned and her backside ached , but she remained determined . She kept her head held high , even when a cold mist developed , sending shivers through her body . Even when her cousin Steven , who had teased her into lifting her skirts and racing him in the first place , came and grinned at her . Even when Goody Sprague walked past and stared at her with disdain . Abigail did not move . She did not even blink an eye . She would n't . Abby did not for an instant believe it was evil for a girl to take pleasure in running and having her legs free . If she was n't meant to race , why had the Lord given her those legs in the first place ? Her right thigh begin to twitch . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . " They will not see me move . They will not see me move , " she continued to whisper to herself . Rain was now dribbling down her back , snaking its way between her shoulder blades , cold and wet . Abby sat up straighter . The parchment paper sign , sinner , that hung about her neck grew damp and clung to her bodice . Cold crept into her hands , which lay clasped in her lap . With her feet locked into place and her legs stretched straight out in front of her with no support , Abbyfelt strained beyond enduring . She willed herself to see her limbs in the wooden holes as if they were someone else 's , removed from the pain . It felt as if days had passed , though Abigail knew her sentence was only six hours . She was hungry , yet this made her more determined . She lifted her head higher and peered out into the growing darkness , watching lights appear as each house in the village lit its candles . At last , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer , they came : four of the town elders and Abigail 's grandfather , Reverend Dane . Abigail looked straight into Grandpappy 's eyes . She regretted having shamed him , but she was not sorry for the racing . Surely he had mistaken the words of the Lord if he believed that she was a sinner . Abby knew that she flew like the angels when she ran . " Your punishment is complete , Abigail Faulkner , " Justice Bradstreet said . " Release her . " The others lifted the bar of the stocks . Abby stared at the men , and left her legs there . She would not move until they had left . She was not about to let them see her shake and perhaps fall as she attempted to stand on her stiff and weak legs . " Are you not yet repentant , Abigail ? " asked Elder Stevens in wonder . Abby saw Grandpappy 's face turn scarlet at her refusal to move . She knew he would not like how she was about to answer Elder Stevens . Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was saved from saying anything by the arrival of her mother . Mama came from the shadows and descended upon them , her face stern and drawn . " Please , good sirs , leave me to tend to her , " she said . " The child will sicken if we leave her here much longer . Can you not discuss saving her soul in more tolerable weather ? Let me take her home now . " The elders grumbled but finally turned and left for their own homes , warm fires , and suppers . " You are too easy on her , Hannah , " Grandpappy said . " Not now , Father , " Mama said . " We can discuss this at a later time . " Grandpappy grunted . He gave Abby one last look , then headed off into the darkness . Mama turned toward her daughter . Her eyes searched Abigail 's , but she said nothing . Quickly , she leaned down and began to rub Abby 's legs until Abby began to feel them again . The sensation was painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from crying out . Mama leaned over and put her arms around her daughter . " Can you move your legs ? " Abigail lifted first one leg , and then the other to the ground . Pain tore through each one as she moved them from the stocks . " I fear I may not make it home , Mama , " she whispered . Mama lifted Abigail slightly . " I 'll wager you 'll do it , Bear . But rise slowly now . " At the sound of Mama 's nickname for her , Abby blinked back tears . She remembered the day her mother had first called her that . She was only five years old , and a big black bear had wandered into their garden . Abigail had just finished her daily weeding when she saw the bear rooting around , tearing up the garden she had just put in order . " Get out of here ! " Abigail had yelled , bringing her mother to the door . " Abby , " her mother had said softly , gesturing furiously at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . " " I will not , " Abby had replied angrily , picking up a stick . " Get out , you old bear ! " " Abigail , stop , " her mother whispered . " You 'll make him angry . " But Abigail would not stop . She banged that stick against the wooden gate of the garden , attracting the bear 's attention , then moved slowly toward him . She hit the stick again , continuing to move toward the bear and the garden gate . Finally , the bear backed away , then fled into the woods . " Abby , " her mother said , running forward and clutching her daughter to her . " Are you mad ? Do n't you ever do that again ! " " I will , " Abby had said fiercely . " I 'm not about to hoe this garden twice for any old bear . " Her mother had laughed and kissed her daughter . " You are fierce enough to be part bear yourself , child , " she had said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courageous now . But her legs ached terribly , and the tears threatened . " Steady , " Mama whispered . " ' T is not seemly to cry here , Abigail . Let us get you back home . You have withstood this most bravely . Do not let them see you weaken now . " Abby nodded and began to take her first steps , leaning upon her mother . Her legs shook and her feet felt numb , but she felt more confident with Mama 's arm strong and sure around her . " Slowly , Abigail , " Mama whispered . Abby did not glance up at the steep climb ahead of them to their home . Instead , she looked down at the muddy road , concentrating on every step , placing each foot carefully before adding weight to it . Slowly they walked up the hill until at last , Mama stopped . " We 're home , Bear , " Mama said . " Dorothy ! " she called . The door swung open , and Abigail sighed with relief at the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the last few steps inside and collapsed onto a stool , weak and weary . She had made it . She was home . " Drink this , " Mama said , handing Abby a warm mug of steaming cider . Abigail , who lay in bed with several coverlets over her , took the pewter mug and drank deeply . The warmth of the cider ran through her . Still , she shivered . Outside , the night watch called the hour . " Take your ease , Bear , " Mama whispered . " I want you abed this evening . Tomorrow is the Sabbath , and you 'll be wanted at the service . So rest now . " Abby scowled . Already , she could feel the stares of the congregation and the fiery sermon her grandfather would deliver for her benefit alone . She could feel the aches in her bones as she tried to sit still for the four hours of service on the hard wooden pew of the meetinghouse . After a day in the stocks , she knew this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have to withstand a long sermon on top of today 's punishment . Mama smiled and stroked Abigail 's cheek . " Stop fussing , Abby . You 'll face tomorrow bravely . You proved today that you 're stouthearted enough . " " Mama , what Abby did was wrong , " Dorothy whispered . Abigail 's older sister stood at the door with a bowl of stew and a piece of corn bread . Abigail could smell the stew , and her mouth watered . " Dorothy , come , " Mama said . " Bring Abigail 's food here and take her soiled garments downstairs with you . " " But Mama , " Dorothy continued , as she handed the bowl to Abigail , " it 's wrong for her to race . Should n't we be telling her not to do it ? " Mama sighed and reached out to rest her hand on top of Dorothy 's head . " I know they say it is wrong , daughter , but I fear I am as uncertain as your sister as to why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's sinful , Mama , " Dorothy said . She turned and looked at her ten-year-old sister . " I fear for Abigail 's soul . " Mama laughed . " It seems anything that is pleasurable is sinful , dear one , and as for Abby 's soul , she is as innocent as you are . Do not take things so seriously , Dorothy . Life is hard enough without some joy at times . Perhaps I shall have you join Abigail here , and let you race with the devil for a fortnight . " " Mama ! " Dorothy said , her eyes wide . Mama laughed again . Then Dorothy , too , began to laugh . " I would never race , Mama , " Dorothy said , making a face , " as I do most truly hate to run . " Mama and Dorothy laughed all the harder . Mama hugged Dorothy and then gave her a little push . " Take the garments , Dorothy . We will speak more on this matter later . Tonight I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , Abby ? " Dorothy asked , turning to her sister . " Aye , " Abigail answered with a weak smile . " I shall be fine on the morrow . " Dorothy picked up the wet clothes and left the room , looking back uncertainly at Mama and Abigail . " So , daughter , pray , tell me . Was the race worth the result ? " Mama asked . Abigail swallowed her stew before answering . She was well aware of what her family would suffer because of her behavior . But then she thought of the run , of the race across the field this morning , of the way she 'd let her legs fly . It was worth it , she thought fiercely . It was worth every minute . " Say it not , Bear , " Mama said , smiling . " I see the answer in your face . " Then Mama 's smile dimmed . " Still , I fear life will not be easy for you should you always insist on doing things in your own fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bowl from Abigail 's hand . " Mama , " Abby said , " I am sorry for the trouble I cause you . " Mama bent and kissed her daughter . She stroked her cheek . " Oh , Abby , " she said . " I truly do n't mind if it means you are happy . " There was a noise in the doorway . Abby 's father was there , shuffling back and forth . He cleared his throat as he shifted from foot to foot . " How fare you , Abigail ? " he asked , not looking at her . " Well , " she replied . Her impatience rose at the sight of him . He had not come to check on her once while she was in the stocks . She had known he would n't . He never could face anything unpleasant , and that fact irritated Abby . Her father nodded . " All right , then . " He turned and was gone . Abby 's mother sighed . " If only happiness for others in this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail knew Mama loved Papa , and so she understood her mother 's sadness . Abby loved him too , but she hated his weakness and sometimes lost patience with him , even when she tried her hardest not to . " Good night , Abigail , " Mama whispered , then blew out the candle in the room . " Good night , Mama , " Abigail whispered back . She turned on her side and stared into the darkness . Her legs ached from having been held so straight and stiff in the stocks . She knew the pain would keep her from sleep . And too , Abby wished tomorrow was any day but the Sabbath .
