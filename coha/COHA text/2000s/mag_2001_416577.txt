Learn Cosmo 's love laws and soon he 'll be begging to be your boyfriend . // * The secret to snagging a lasting and loving relationship ? Not scaring off potential boyfriends who cross your path by coming on too strong . The simple truth is , most guys go gaga when you take a laissez-faire approach to love ( and are n't afraid to say no at certain key moments ) . That 's why The Rules-that land-a-man manual from the mid-90s-became such a megaseller as soon as it hit the stores . But the dating doctrines that the book promoted were so unrealistically rigid and over-the-top retro that it ultimately turned many women-and men-off . ( And the kicker is , one of The Rules ' authors is getting divorced ! ) Enter Cosmos love laws : a set of smart strategies that are flexible enough to fit your personal situation and are way more modern-woman friendly . Consider this your definitive guide to reeling in the right guy and sealing the deal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So read on for our dating principles and get ready to secure a dude who 'll be hopelessly devoted to you . 1 NEVER ASK HIM OUT THE FIRST TIME Want to score a permanent spot on his speed dial ? Drop some let's-go-on-a-date bait but resist the urge to ask him out . There are ways to hint that you 're hankering for a hookup without actually suggesting it . Why is a coy come-on the way to go ? Asking him out yourself instantly devalues your dating stock because you deprive him of the thrill of the chase , explains Jeff Wise , author of the American Dating Association Universal Dating Regulations and Bylaws . " And guys love to be the pursuers . " That does n't mean you have to be completely passive . Subtly encourage him to ask you out by dropping interest innuendos during a conversation , suggests Julie Taylor , author of The Girl 's Guide to Guys . For example , if you 're at a party rapping with a guy about music you love , say something like " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That way , you 're clearly flirting and giving him an opportunity to ask you out . " Women can initiate contact and send signals , but most guys would rather be the one to propose the actual date , " says Wise . Photograph Draw him closer with a coy code of conduct . // Kerry* , 23 , had always asked guys out but was never sure if they said yes because they actually liked her or because they were just too polite to say no . So when she started crushing on a cute new coworker , she decided to try a new tactic : " Every morning for two weeks , I would swing by his cubicle to say hi , always finding a way to tease him , usually about his pigsty office space . It was so obvious that I was flirting , but I never pushed it beyond that . He totally picked up on my vibe and asked me out for drinks . It was so refreshing to know for sure that he was into me . " Break it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sense he still would n't get up the necessary nerve in a million years . * It 's now or never . Passing up a one-shot moment with a could-be-The-One man is just plain stupid . For instance , he 's a stranger standing in line with you at Starbucks or you met at a party but he 's only in town for the weekend . 2 SAY NO TO LAST-MINUTE PLANS No matter how bad you 're groovin ' on a guy , if he calls Friday afternoon for a Friday-night date , never ditch your plans with pals or any prescheduled event , no matter how lame ( that goes for laundry too ) . If you really are free ? Fib . It 's better to tell a white lie than to risk letting him view you as a desperate single chick who will drop everything at a moment 's notice . The goal is for him to want desperately to see you . . . enough to dial your digits at least a few days in advance . " The harsh reality is that guys ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something better to come along , " says Wise . Or worse , his original plans fell through and you 're his backup babe . If you let a guy see you as social filler , he 'll never respect you , explains Wise . Besides , always anxiously awaiting his call hardly puts you where you need to be-in a mental power position . So what do you do when your prospective paramour is a habitual down-to-the  --  wire dialer ? Just be conveniently busy whenever his eleventh-hour invites come in and , eventually , he 'll get the message . That did the trick for Liz , 26 . " I met this great guy , Doug , but after two dates , he tried to pull the sorry stunt of calling at 4 P.M. for dinner that evening . Instead of canceling my plans , I said that I was busy . He asked about tomorrow , and I said I could n't . There was this long pause , and I was worried he was about to give up . But he asked me out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next weekend too . . . just in case ! " Break it if ... * His incredible , amazing plans could n't possibly have been organized in advance , like his sister got sick and gave him her fourth-row Madonna tickets . * It was meant to be a surprise . Example : He shows up at your office with flowers and a picnic basket hoping to whisk you off to a private picnic . 3 CREATE CLIFFHANGERS Other draw-him-closer strategies : Walk away midflirt , wrap up your phone call first , and always be the one to end a date . Let 's say you meet a hot prospect at a bar . Flirt until it 's clear you 're connecting , then motor to get another margarita , say hi to a pal , pay your tab . . . whatever . Better yet , he 'll be dying to hunt you down ( later or the next day ) to hear what happens . " Suddenly circulating makes you someone who 's instantly interesting , " says Taylor . Colette , 27 , found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound effect . " When my boyfriend first started calling me , he 'd always end the conversation first , " she recalls . " I thought he was getting bored with me . So I started making a concerted effort to cut our calls short , saying I had somewhere to be or my roommate had to use the phone . I 'd even jump off before I 'd finished telling a story . He tells me now that he kept calling me more to find out how my stories ended ! " Photograph // Break it if ... * He 's in the middle of opening up about something superpersonal . Rushing off the phone or flitting over to the next conversation could crush his ego or , worse , make you look like a cold-hearted bitch . * You 've worked that angle ad nauseam . In this case , leaving the guy constantly sitting on the edge of his seat will end up annoying rather than enticing him . 4 KNOW WHEN TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE Dying to spill your deepest secrets to your sexy new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new connection feels , remember that the guy sitting across from you is your date , not your therapist . So skip the story about your freaky phobia of having your feet touched . Same goes for what you want to name your firstborn or how you 'll just die if you do n't get married before you 're 30 . " Revealing too much too soon will do nothing but turn him off , " says Ellen Kreidman , Ph.D. , author of Single No More . " Women spill the most personal parts of their lives to establish instant intimacy , but it often backfires . " Besides , one of the most amazing parts of dating is slowly discovering new facets of the other person . Keeping things light builds intrigue-he 's left to wonder and fantasize about what you might be like when he gets to know you better . Maddie , 26 , made the mistake of rushing into deep , personal conversations and it cost her a budding relationship . " This guy and I were connecting so well on the second date that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep depression after my last boyfriend broke up with me , " she recalls . " I could see his expression change , and I knew I 'd blown it . He did n't ask me out again . . . it was a classic case of TMI . " Break it if ... * You were close friends before you started going out . He 's already seen your dirty laundry , so there 's no sense hiding it or trying to seem mysterious now . * He 's telling you personal stuff . That 's your green light to share too . Besides , you do n't want to deprive him of a confidante if that 's what he 's looking for in you . 5 GO AHEAD AND DO EVERYTHING BUT ... The last but most important seduction secret is also the toughest to follow : resisting the urge to have sex early in a romance . Sure , some lifelong pairings start off with a bang , so to speak . But by postponing the main event for at least several dates , you 're more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning behind this whole holdoff strategy is the difference between how men and women view sex , says Kreidman . " Women think physical intimacy moves a relationship forward and creates closeness , while men do n't put as much emotional stock in or importance on the act , " she says . Another reason to refrain ( you 're gon na need all the incentives you can get ! ) : Men know that women see sex as an instant bond , which can propel them into a commitment freak-out , making them more likely to bail on you , says Kreidman . Abstaining from sex also builds anticipation and makes doing the deed so much hotter . ( After all , you 've had a month or more of foreplay ! ) By fooling around without going full throttle , you 're whetting his appetite . You might want to tell him all the stuff you 're dying to do to him some day . " Just make sure he knows that in your case , holding out is not about prudishness , it 's about self-control , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " Not rushing into getting it on helped Amanda , 27 , score a long-term love connection . " I made my boyfriend wait two months before having sex with him . I 'd been burned in the past , so I wanted to take it slow this time , " she says . " He later told me that by making him wait , it forced him to think of me in terms of a serious relationship rather than just some fling . He also made sure to mention that it helped that I was a guru in the oral arts ; that seemed to be more than enough good stuff to tide him over !

The male animal has a high sex drive and will take on rivals for the object of his desire 's affection , says Helen Fisher , Ph.D. , author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're busy , it can trigger his need to beat out the competitors . They love the chase . A man 's motivation to win over a seemingly elusive woman is all based on a primitive law of survival : The better a woman 's genes , the more likely his bloodline is to continue , says Fisher . So he assumes that a hard-to-get honey is a better catch than an easy-to-nab chick . They 're used to making the first move . In the animal kingdom , the female 's role in the mating dance is usually to flirt and the male 's job is to initiate nooky .
