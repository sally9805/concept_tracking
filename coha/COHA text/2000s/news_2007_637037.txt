<p> You hear it every day : " I 'm 39 , but I feel 25 . " Or better yet , " I feel like I 'm 16 ! " <p> When you 're healthy and in good shape , you could be considered to have a young " biological age "  --  that is , your body has experienced less damage than the average person who 's had the same number of birthdays as you . <p> There are different tests that attempt to determine biological age . Some measure memory and reaction time ; some gauge strength , flexibility and lung function ; and others , such as the RealAge test , compare your healthy and unhealthy habits  --  how many times a week you floss your teeth , for instance , or eat red meat , or how much you smoke . Dr. Michael F. Roizen , chairman of the division of anesthesiology at the Cleveland Clinic , developed the RealAge concept to motivate some of his patients who had unhealthy habits . He wanted to show them that bad habits can put extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " effect . The RealAge company he co-founded analyzed thousands of medical and scientific studies to come up with its formula . <p> There 's no universal standard for calculating biological age . A single test ca n't predict how long you 'll live . But calculating your biological age might show you that you should be taking better care of yourself . <p> Gloria Moton-Dunbar of Mableton is 36 but has a biological age of 39.4 . Reading the test results on paper motivated her to exercise more , she says . " It 's one thing when you go to the doctor , and he says , ' You should exercise more , you should take more vitamins , ' but with the printout , you actually see it in categories of how you can actually improve your health . . . Sometimes you think , oh , I should exercise , but where should I start ? " <p> Roizen suggests making small changes consistently . " It 's not that difficult . It 's as difficult as choosing peanut butter made from peanuts over peanut butter made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as choosing nut over chip ; it 's as difficult as choosing Diet Coke over Coke . " <p> And even if you practiced unhealthy habits for decades , it 's never too late to lay them to rest . You can still benefit from positive changes you make late in life . " That 's the incredible thing about the human body , " Roizen says . <p> RealAge Test ( abridged version ) <p> This test measures the biological age of your body based on lifestyle , genetics and medical history .

" When you say a 35-year-old  --  because of stress and smoking , he 's got a ' 55-year-old body '  --  what you really mean is his body is run-down and deteriorated , not that it 's really 55 . My recommendation is , in this kind of talk , leave age out of it . Just talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips to preserve your quality of life , whatever your age : <p> * Stay or get active . Get aerobic exercise , practice strength training , and stretch for flexibility . <p> * Lose weight . Studies show that being overweight or obese reduces your disability-free years . <p> * Challenge your mind . Read good books or do puzzles . Even though the brain is n't a muscle , it will deteriorate if you do n't use it vigorously . <p> * Be social . A network of friends offers you support and gets you out of the house . If you do n't have close friends , consider joining a church or book group , or volunteer your time at a place that needs hands-on help . <p> * Keep a positive attitude . Do n't assume that you 're going to get frail and feeble . Instead , look for opportunities to improve your strength and health . <p> * Practice good health while you 're still healthy . " If you escaped your younger adult years without a major chronic illness like heart disease , diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter old age healthier , you tend to live longer . It 's almost like the longer you live , the longer you live , to some extent , " says Dr. Jeff Lesesne , assistant professor of geriatric medicine at Emory University School of Medicine . <p> * If you did n't practice healthy habits early on , know that it 's not too late . Studies indicate that some smokers who quit for 10 years regain some of their lung function , Lesesne says . So when you do good things for your body , you 'll reap benefits .
