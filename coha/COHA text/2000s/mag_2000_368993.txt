Talking to a computer is always easier than typing , which is why engineers have been working with such fervor on voice-recognition technology . They 've made great progress . The accuracy rates of dictation programs from industry leaders  --  Lernout &; Hauspie , Dragon Systems , Microsoft and IBM  --  have been improving around 10% a year for a decade now . During the next year , voice software geared to their specialized vocabularies is expected to gain a foothold in the medical and legal professions . Popular search sites like AskJeeves and TellMe Network hope to become " voice portals , " letting users seek information by speaking simple phrases into the phone . <P> That 's just the start . The next few years will begin the era of " pervasive computing , " when the focus of digital software will migrate from desktop PCs linked to the Internet by phone wire to a plethora of newfangled , Web-ready products ranging from TVs and cell phones to dashboards and Palm Pilots . " You 'll have the Internet in your pocket , anytime , anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user-interface platforms , of tomorrow 's wireless and handheld devices . Most of them will be too small to have a keyboard . " The only way you 're ever going to get lots of data into small devices , " says Dragon Systems founder Janet Baker , " is by talking to them . " <P> Eventually they 'll even understand you . The 10-year horizon promises the birth of both natural-language software that " understands " many complex sentences , and broadband data speeds that make online video ubiquitous . The average software product in 2010 could well have a face , a voice , ears and something resembling a brain , which suggests that our next great challenge will be figuring out what we really want to say . <P>  --  By Michael Krantz
