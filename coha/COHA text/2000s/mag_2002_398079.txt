HYBRID CARS ARE REINVENTING THE DRIVING VACATION . BY DIANE DI COSTANZO // The question : How far can a family of four travel on one tank of gas ? The answer : Farther than you might think . In a bright-blue Toyota Prius , my family embarked on a six-day , 600-mile loop around New England on a single tank of gas . Better still , we spent just $16.54 to fill the 11.9-gallon tank and achieved about 50 miles per gallon , an average consistent with Toyota 's estimates of 52 mpg city/45 highway Broken down , the perperson fuel cost was a little more than $4 for a trip that took us around the historic haunts of Salem , Mass. , antiquing in Newburyport , camping on a beach nearby , then driving across the state to stay with Grandma in the Berkshire Hills , before returning home to Redding , Conn . Clearly , our savings at the gas pump were significant-we spent more on soft drinks than on fuel that week . Even more impressive : The two hybrid cars currently marketed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civic Hybrid ( 47 mpg city/51 highway ) , offer an important savings to the environment . " The Prius emits roughly 90 percent fewer tail-pipe emissions than most conventional cars , " says Wade Hoyt , a spokesperson for Toyota . Currently , cars and passenger trucks are the second-largest U.S. source of carbon-dioxide pollution ( behind industrial polluters ) , releasing more than 1.3 billion metric tons of this greenhouse gas in the year 2000 , according to the Natural Resources Defense Council . If all Americans drove hybrids , car emissions would be slashed to as little as 10 percent of their current totals . " The technology exists . The power is with the consumer now . It 's up to us to show automakers that we will buy and drive these cars , " says Rob Stuart , campaign producer for the Web-based Patriot 's Energy Pledge Campaign . Through its campaign , the nonprofit group hopes to convince Americans to drive greener for yet another reason : The United States has possession of just three percent of the world 's oil reserves , but accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in our pouring " billions of dollars into volatile regions to protect &gt; access to the fuel we need , " states Stuart , who says that the campaign was born after September 11 , 2001 , as a grassroots way of getting Americans to reduce their national reliance on foreign oil . For instance : " If we all drove cars that achieved just 40 mpg , drivers would save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day , the same quantity of oil that we now import from the Persian Gulf , " Stuart says . " Our last two wars were fought over oil . The link between fuel consumption and national security is becoming dear to the average American . " Surprisingly , support for hybrids is coming from a consumer group we tend to associate with Jaguars and Bentleys : Hollywood 's glitterati . Celebrities who have downshifted to gas-saving hybrids include Cameron Diaz , David Duchovny , Billy Joel , Patricia Arquette , and Carole King ( see " What Celebrities Are Saying About Hybrids " on page 30 ) . The glam quotient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive around in ? Well , for starters , you do n't have to plug it in at night , or ever , to recharge the battery ; when in operation , the gas-driven engine regenerates the battery , which runs for 10 years or longer . And both the Toyota Prius and the Honda Civic Hybrid drive just like any other sedan of their class-the only critical difference is the electric motor and its battery pack hidden under the hood or back seat . While in motion , a computer decides whether the car will run more efficiently on gas or electricity , switching seamlessly between the two . At lower speeds and in reverse , the clean , quiet electric motor takes over almost entirely , which means that as the car slides up to a stoplight or backs out of a parking space , it makes no noise at allprompting many drivers to check to be sure the vehicle is still running . In general , both the Prius and the Honda Civic Hybrid have good pickup and are smooth and stable at high speeds . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And while hybrids are priced a bit higher than comparable conventional models , at about $20,000 , they save consumers money at the gas pump-and if the federal energy bill currently in Congress passes with the provision intact , hybrid purchasers will also enjoy a tax rebate from Uncle Sam . The trunk space is typical for cars of this class : never enough . But after a moment or two of marital discord , my husband and I managed to body-slam an enormous duffel , camping and tennis gear , a Razor scooter and helmet , and two beach chairs into it . Indeed , one of the few frustrations triggered by hybrid cars is that there are no family-sized models offered in the United States , even though the technology is appropriate for &gt; use in larger vehicles . In Japan , hybrid minivans , full-sized sedans , even a small bus are already available . Slower to come to market are hybrids-large or small-by American manufacturers . Automakers in the United States are pinning their performance hopes on the development of fuel-cell-powered vehicles , explains Therese Langer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EnergyEfficient Economy , which publishes ACEEE 's Green Book : The Environmental Guide to Cars &; Trucks ( $8.95 ; available at 202429-8873 or www.aceee.org ) annually . The good news is that family-size , American-made hybrids will become available in the next few years : The Ford Escape HEY , a hybrid SUV slated to debut late in 2003 ( with a projected mid-30s mpg ) , a hybrid Dodge Durango , and a General Motors pickup truck are also in the works . Meanwhile , fuel-cell vehicles are emerging as test vehicles , using no oil at all and producing near-zero carbon-dioxide emissions ( see " Fuel-Cell Facts " on page 28 ) . One problem with fuel-cell-powered vehicles is that it will be at least another 10 years before they 're mass-produced , says Larger . Until then , hybrids will likely be the high-tech vehicle driven by green-minded Americans , especially those who reside in California , where lawmakers recently signed legislation that will set state-mandated limits on the amounts of carbon dioxide vehicles can emit . Heralded as the first of its kind worldwide , Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon pollution standards for vehicles in model years 2009 and beyond . The standards will apply to automakers ' fleet averages , rather than to individual vehicles , so while larger , more gas thirsty vehicles will still be sold in California , the average fleetwide mpg achieved by any carmaker selling cars in the state will drop significantly . " Opponents of this bill say the sky is falling , " said California Governor Gray Davis when he signed the bill into law . " But they said it about unleaded gasoline . They said it about catalytic converters . They said it about seat belts and air bags . But the sky is not falling . It 's just getting a whole lot cleaner .

Some manufacturers see a day when consumers will be able to extract hydrogen from the natural gas that 's already delivered to their homes . fueling up their cars in the privacy of their own garages . - D.D.C .
