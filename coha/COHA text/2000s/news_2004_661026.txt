<p> From the upper-floor balcony of the pagoda on Lion Hill , we looked out in one direction over the city 's modern skyline , and in the other we saw the wide , brown Yangtze . A train was crossing a two-level bridge over the river . Beyond the multicolored roof tiles of the old-style pagoda spread Nanjing . <p> One of the surprises of Nanjing is that it was the home port for Zheng He , who inspired the Sinbad-the-Sailor legend in " The Arabian Nights . " Sun Jun , my guide , explained that this pagoda was dedicated to the great explorer whose ships were launched here in the early 1400s and who crossed the oceans on seven long voyages of adventure . <p> The Chinese admiral , who was Muslim , repeatedly journeyed to ports of the Persian Gulf . He made quite an impression there as an adventurous and exotic leader - his fleet may have included up to 317 ships and more than 27,000 men . <p> Last summer 's animated film about Sinbad revived his celebrity , but a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired British naval officer Gavin Menzies speculated that in 1421 Zheng He , aka Sinbao or Sinbad , reached America before Columbus . <p> Nanjing ( formerly Nanking ) is a stately former capital , protected by the longest city wall ever built , but an adventure story like Sinbad 's suits the city just as well . <p> " Nanjing is a mirror of China 's history , " Mr. Sun says . Many believe that this is where modern China began , when British gunboats steamed up the Yangtze in 1841 and forced China to open its ports to foreigners . Here , in the early 1900s , Dr. Sun Yat-sen declared China a republic , toppling the Qing Dynasty . He restored Nanjing as China 's capital , and is immortalized in a mausoleum that exudes all the splendor of the Lincoln memorial . The city witnessed the horrors of modern warfare in the carnage of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937 . <p> For me , Nanjing was a side trip from main stops in Hong Kong , Guangzhou , and Beijing , but it quickly became one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I arrived on a domestic flight , knowing just three words in Mandarin . But Sun , the guide arranged through the China International Travel Service , met me at the airport with the poise and mild British accent of a well-traveled sociologist , although he grew up and studied in Nanjing . His parents were intellectuals whose careers were stifled by the Cultural Revolution . <p> " When people from Nanjing visit other cities , " Sun notes , " they say they are from Jingling , " its ancient name , which is translated as " golden city . " It first became China 's capital in the third century A.D. and again in the 1300s . <p> The Ming tombs on nearby Purple Mountain are a big draw , so on my first day Sun spirited me past the red Drum Tower and through the city 's roundabouts to the east side . <p> On the hill outside the massive gray city gate , schoolchildren gamboled through the annual plum-blossom festival , as acres of pretty pink and white blossoms stretched into the morning mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> We walked down the Sacred Way toward the Ming tombs , a scenic promenade past huge stone elephants , camels , and lions . At night , the path is believed by some to teem with the wandering ghosts of emperors . <p> In the Drum Tower 's market kiosk , vendors sell polished stones , porcelain , calligraphy , and paintings . One artist unrolled for me stunning watercolors that he had painted . Through a series of gestures and pen scribbles we bargained for two cards and a landscape of Tai Hu lake area in bloom . <p> The city 's main industries make television sets ( sold in China and Cuba ) and Panda computers . A computer costs almost a month 's rent , but Sun 's cable modem costs just 100 yuan a month - about $ 12 . An Internet cafe named PC Bar felt like a **26;1179;TOOLONG ; I checked my e-mail for less than 75 cents an hour . <p> Because I could n't speak Chinese , getting a bite to eat by myself was more challenging than logging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a noodle shop and ended up instead at a Korean restaurant with a plate of kebabs . <p> The next day I wanted to explore the Sinbad connection , so from the city 's northwest gate Sun and I walked between the city wall and the river , toward Lion Hill . We passed the site of the temple where the British gunboats forced China to open to the West and give up Hong Kong . <p> Zheng He began life as a court eunuch and , through intelligence and devotion , rose to be an admiral in the navy of Emperor Yong Le . During Yong Le 's reign , hundreds of scholars from Thailand , Korea , and Japan came to study at Nanjing 's Guozijian National University , which was larger than its counterparts in Oxford , Cambridge , and Paris . So Zheng He would have been familiar with tales of other lands . <p> On his voyages he went beyond Thailand and India and took Chinese commerce to Arabia and down the eastern coast of Africa . He may have gone as far as Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea goddess contains a stone tablet that Yong Le dedicated to the goddess in thanks for the voyages of his fleet , including those led by Zheng He . Built in 1416 , the temple commemorated the admiral 's voyage to the Indian Ocean . <p> The stele rises 15 feet from the back of a stone tortoise and is topped by a pair of scaly , intertwined dragons . The emperor 's inscription calls the sea goddess Tian Fei , " Protectress of the Empire , Benefactress of the people , mysteriously powerful , manifestly loyal , magnanimous and universally kind . " <p> He added : " Wind , rain , thunder , lightning , all are under her sway and she has the power , according to her desire , to loose them or to withhold them ... All the foreign peoples , children of the same father , tattooed skin and multicolored garments , all come to visit me ... Our goddess protects them . " <p> Near the entrance to Lion Hill is a bronze statue of Zheng He standing regally beside a horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiked to the top of the hill and entered the pagoda to find inside a model of Zheng He 's ship , a rusted anchor from his fleet , and a mural . We climbed more stairs to inspect the mural 's details . <p> It portrays , in lushly colored tiles , the admiral 's contacts with other peoples - Africans , Indians , Southeast Asians - and celebrates the moment when Ming-era China saw a brief and glorious opening to the world . <p> The old section of Nanjing is very walkable and friendly to tourists , with attractive footbridges and yellow-suited rickshaw pullers . We stopped at the Confucian Temple and a museum devoted to the imperial examinations for civil-service applicants . <p> The scholar known as Confucius went unrecognized in his time , but five centuries later his works became the definitive academic curriculum and the basis for the imperial examinations . Confucius believed that a scholar should master six skills , including music and horsemanship . <p> The temple features magnificent carved jade panels depicting scenes from Confucius 's life . In the back we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nearby stood the city 's central gate , or Zhonghuamen Gate ( Zhonghua is also the name for China ) . Beginning in the 1400s , the gate protected residents with five stone entrances , each with a vast slab that could be lowered against intruders . <p> Today it 's a peaceful scene where old men compete using a large , antique top that they keep aloft on a string . <p> On the stone gate 's uppermost deck , where an observation palace once stood , people were flying kites in a stiff wind . <p> The Chaotian Gong Palace on Machoulu Road offered another glimpse of the city 's past . In the square , men played cards and women sold leather goods . Like Lion Hill , the place fared poorly during the Cultural Revolution and was rebuilt in the 1980s , based on photographs . <p> A museum - delightfully free of other tourists - displays a remarkable military vehicle : A little mannequin is perched atop a pole , high enough that the troops could see it from afar . An intricate gear system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicle turned . Thus it acted like a compass , giving a directional reference if no other was available . <p> Later I visited the PC Bar again , checked my e-mail , and taxied to Hunan Road where a stone arch welcomes all shoppers . <p> I finally found the restaurant that Sun had recommended : Nanjing Da Pai Dang , where the maitre d ' in imperial dress escorted me across a wooden bridge to my table , and I could choose dishes from a picture menu or from the cooking areas around the room . I was almost the only foreigner there . <p> In Sinbad 's home city , I felt like an explorer . As I walked back to my hotel , I almost knew where I was going . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
