Brokeback Mountain is the kind of film you do n't see nowadays : a western . Yet a half-century ago , the genre dominated the big and small screens . Every movie star from Monroe to Brando had to ride a horse , and in the 1958-59 TV season , six of the top seven shows were oaters . Here is a passel of DVDs worth packing in your saddlebag . <P> SAM PECKINPAH 'S LEGENDARY WESTERNS COLLECTION <P> The first scene in The Wild Bunch  --  a swarm of red ants devouring a scorpion as children giggle at the sport  --  could summarize Peckinpah 's view of humanity . Something in this legendary auteur , who drank and crazied himself out of a brilliant career , said , " Life is awful . Ai n't it fun to watch ? " This DVD package spotlights two wild westerns ( The Wild Bunch and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid ) and two mild ones ( Ride the High Country and The Ballad of Cable Hogue ) , all paying tribute to colorful , mournful rogues whose time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE <P> Steve McQueen , fresh from the Actors Studio , got his first starring role in this 1958 TV series , and at times he must have thought Lee Strasberg would disown him . McQueen 's method here was a weathered glint and a sawed-off Winchester rifle in his holster . As a bounty hunter with a stern personal code of ethics , McQueen did have something Hollywood could appreciate : star quality . The fun in this first-season DVD is watching him mix it up with other tyros  --  James Coburn , Warren Oates , Michael Landon  --  who would also soon learn how to commandeer the screen . <P> HAVE GUN  --  WILL TRAVEL <P> " A knight with-out armor in a savage land , " the theme song said . Paladin was a good guy who dressed in black , dispensing bullets , beatings and quotes from Shakespeare with equal facility . As incarnated by Richard Boone , whose dandyish mustache and amused baritone voice lent ironic counterpoint to a face that looked as if it had just lost six barroom brawls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed no supporting cast to cheer on or question his decisions ; he already had the writers and directors to make this series the best in the West . <P> THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN <P> First the western went east  --  to Japan , where Akira Kurosawa transformed it into The Seven Samurai ( 1954 )  --  then it came home , in this 1960 version of the Kurosawa classic . For a time , it upended the genre 's concentration on noble or twisted loners ; this was the first all-star western romp . It 's in no way a terrific film ; director John Sturges was a pedestrian showman . But to watch McQueen , Coburn , Yul Brynner , Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach fight for screen time is to see a fabulous showdown of egos  --  like Meet the Fockers , with six-guns instead of sex puns . <P> SEVEN MEN FROM NOW <P> Among the great directors of westerns , Budd Boetticher is the forgotten man . Between 1956 and ' 60 he teamed with Randolph Scott for seven films , tight-lipped , sunbaked fables of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , none of these B-movie masterpieces have been on DVD . Seven Men from Now is the first and a fine introduction to the canon . But we need the rest , to teach the young'uns how stark and eloquent a western can be . <P> GUNSMOKE
