The black bears that wander into the backyard can be pretty exciting . But visitors to the eminently cozy Mount Juneau Inn in Juneau , Alaska , tend to save their best reviews for Leo , the bed-and-breakfast 's low-key resident MacKenzie River husky . " He 's the world 's greatest dog , " raves New Jerseyite Christine de Vries . <P> The seven-bedroom house , decorated with the work of indigenous Tlingit and Haida artists , is a warm home base from which to explore considerably icier surroundings . Homemade breakfasts include local delicacies like fireweed honey and salmonberry jam . The inconvenience of shared baths with most bedrooms fades with a scan of the water and mountain views from each . <P> Alaska is home to some of the country 's most spectacular expanses of wilderness . Its capital , known as the Gateway to the Glaciers , boasts such nearby attractions as Admiralty Island National Monuments , home to the world 's largest concentration of brown bears , and the Juneau Ice Fields .
