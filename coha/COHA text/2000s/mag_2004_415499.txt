" Get a new doctor if your current one wo n't test you for anemia and other medical causes for fatigue . " LETTERS Water and Weight Loss " Good Advice That 's Not " ( Health , July ) said drinking lots of water wo n't help you lose weight . It is true that water ca n't fill you up , but drinking it is an important weight-loss tool since water helps metabolize fat and sugars. - Theresa Westhoff , Lafayette , Colo . Photograph // Shape Advisory Board Member Nancy Clark , M.S. , R.D. , responds : " When losing weight , your body does not need extra water to metabolize fat and sugar . You do , however , need to drink enough water to stay adeguately hydrated . Salads , soups , yogurt , fruit and vegetables ( all foods that are a part of a healthy diet and commonly part of a weight-loss plan ) have high water content and help meet your daily fluid needs .

" Jersey Rules " Live Strong : Wear Yellow " ( Live Healthy News , August ) stated that the winner of each segment of the Tour de France is awarded a yellow jersey . The yellow jersey is actually awarded to the overall leader at the end of each stage . - Arnie Luder , PaIo Alto , Calif . Editor 's note : We plead guilty to making a confusing statement , but not to ignorance : We were referring to the time leader as " the winner , " not the person who crosses the finish line first ( who gets a trophy ) . Just as a point of interest , there is also a green jersey ( best sprinter ) , a white one with dots ( best climber ) , and one that 's solid white ( best time performance under age 26 ) .

The reader had been to her doctor many times and still could n't pinpoint a medical cause for her lethargy , and Domar advised the reader to change doctors . As a family practice physician , I evaluate eight to 10 women a month who complain of fatigue . After testing for anemia , thyroid disorder , diabetes , kidney and liver dysfunction , sleep disorders , and in some cases HIV and lupus , and after sleep studies and multiple specialist referrals , I end up telling 90 percent of them their fatigue is due to depression , stress , unrealistic expectations about the amount of sleep they need , or poor diet and exercise habits . So yes , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemia and other medical causes or if your overall relationship with your doctor is unsatisfying . But if you are fatigued , be prepared to face the reality that we are all overworked , overstressed and overbooked. - Dr. Christine Eady , Austin , Texas I can relate to the reader who had been feeling tired and draggy for months with little help from her doctor . I also suffered from lethargy , flulike symptoms and bouts of depression . Finally , I made an appointment for allergy testing and discovered that food allergies were at the root of my problem . I am allergic to various food items that had been pervasive in my diet , including milk , soybeans and strawberries . I had been starting my day with yogurt , soy milk and strawberry smoothies and taking in other allergens throughout the day . It 's no wonder I never felt entirely well . After eliminating the offenders from my diet , I have more energy , I 'm sleeping better , I 've upped my workout intensity and I 've signed up for my first half-marathon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Most of Moles As someone with many moles , I was pleased to read " Must-Know Facts About Moles " ( Beauty in Action , July ) . It 's important that people monitor their moles , have them checked by their dermatologist and protect themselves from sun exposure . However , I was disappointed to see an extensive how-to on hiding moles with makeup , with no mention ( aside from briefly referring to moles as " beauty marks " ) of embracing your moles as a part of who you are and what makes you unique . Women should n't feel that their moles are something they have to cover up . Have we learned nothing from Cindy Crawford ? - Monica Bushman , Anaheim , Calif . Photograph // Real Motivation When I bought the August issue of Shape , I did n't think it would have anything for me : a 28-year-old woman who is more than 100 pounds overweight .

Russell claims that food manufacturers ' " come-on " packaging and marketing tricks push people to overeat . She also says that there are " many insidious ways in which food marketers subvert our good intentions . " Then is n't it hypocritical for Shape to accept advertisements for food products like beer and chocolate ? If marketers are responsible for making us overeat and we have to be aware of the subtle ways we are told to overeat , then should n't it be Shape 's responsibility as a health and fitness magazine to keep its readers from seeing ads for unhealthy foods ? It is everyone 's duty to watch what she eats , but if Shape is going to talk about the sneaky ways that manufacturers use marketing techniques to keep people eating unhealthful food , should n't Shape keep ads such as these off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego , Calif . Anne M. Russell responds : First , Shape does keep advertising for unhealthy products of any sort off its pages : We have a strict ad-acceptance policy and we simply do not run ads for products that could endanger readers ' health and well-being . We believe that the advertising we do run actually helps readers make good decisions because it provides information they can consider in a comfortable , low-pressure environment . Furnishing ads in that context is in stark contrast to the kind of marketing I was describing in the " Food Fight " editorial - that is , point-of-sale merchandising , which seeks to knock the rational thought process out of the picture so that your appetite , not your brain , makes the decision for you . Consider how long it takes for you to say yes when asked if you want to supersize your order : a fraction of a second . Now contrast that with how long it takes to buy a product you saw in a magazine - best-case scenario : half an hour . That 's plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
