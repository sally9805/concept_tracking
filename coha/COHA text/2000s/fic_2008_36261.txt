Washington <p> They sat at ease in the Oval Office . Had the president looked at his guest , he would have seen a handsome , ageless man , dark-haired , with a smooth oval face and a flawless olive complexion . Had he looked into this man 's eyes , he would have seen the night looking out through a mask ; it was because he had looked there once-and had not liked what he had seen-that he did not look again . <p> Had the president 's guest looked at him , he would have seen a lean and hard-faced man of sixty-three who might have been a farmer or a county agent . <p> In point of fact , the president had been a rodeo rider whole decades ago . He still looked the part . Like all the best politicians , he looked like anything but a politician . <p> " They git you his picture ? " the president asked . <p> His guest shook his head ; on Earth , this guest was known as Gideon Chase . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard blue eyes glinted . " I got a bunch , an ' I want to git ' em out of my desk . Give ' em to the FBI when you 're through . " <p> Gideon picked up the first and glanced at it . " Perfec'ly ordinary , ai n't he , Dr. Chase ? " <p> " There are no ordinary men , although so many believe themselves so . " <p> " You 're right , he ai n't . He 's ordinary lookin ' is what I mean . " <p> Gideon shook his head and tapped the figure in the photograph with a fingernail , at which the figure said , " Woldercan 's a beautiful place , one I 'm sure I 'll miss often . But right now retirement looks awfully good to me and I 'm heading for the South Seas . " <p> " A perfec'ly ordinary-lookin ' man , but if I was asked to name one evil man in our entire nation , an ' if the fate of the whole damned U.S.A. was ridin ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The president waited for Gideon to speak , but Gideon did not . <p> " Brought up in the buildin ' trade . His pa was a contractor . Become a contractor hisself , an ' was smart enough to see the big money went to them that had friends in high places . You want to bellyache about it ? I have , more'n once . Do n't do any good . " " There is no good , " Gideon murmured . His voice was level , expressionless . <p> The president raised an eyebrow . " I know you made a reputation writin ' that shit . You really believe it ? " <p> " My belief or disbelief will not change the truth , " Gideon murmured . <p> The president grinned . " ' What 's truth ? ' said jestin ' Pilate . " <p> " That there is no good . " <p> " Well , sir . . . what about evil ? " <p> " It does not exist . " <p> " Well now , I 'd call that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's a evil man in the world , he 's the one . " <p> Gideon , who was not in fact looking at any of the pictures , said , " There are none . " The president smiled again . " I wish I could believe it . It 'd be comfortin ' . Only I s'pose I 'd have to give up good , too . " <p> " No . May I explain ? You ca n't have a great deal of time . " <p> " For this ? I 'll take as much time as I think will do any good , an ' let the bastards go hang . Explain . " <p> " Briefly , then . Today , most people think evil the mere absence of good . Darkness-which many confuse with evil-is the mere absence of visible light , after all , just as silence is the absence of audible sound . If these people were correct , there would be no evil , only a lack of good . They are wrong , and when they discover they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Mine , " the president said . <p> " Yes . Would you say that evil is synonymous with cruelty ? With greed ? " <p> The president nodded . " I sure would . " <p> " Then you can not be correct . Cruelty and greed are very different things . Cruelty is delight in the pain of others . Greed is an insatiable desire to possess . You do not like the result of either one-unless the greed and cruelty are your own . You avenge yourself upon them by calling them evil . There is no difference in kind between your position and that of a woman who shouts " bad dog " when the puppy soils the carpet . The difference is in degree . Only . " <p> The president pressed a button on his desk . " I think we 'd best git down to business . " <p> Gideon nodded . " So do I. " <p> " I talked to you the way I did , ' cause I was n't sure you was the right man for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you , an ' if anybody 's qualified for this , you 're the one . " <p> Gideon rarely smiled and did not smile now , though there may have been a gleam of humor in his disturbingly dark eyes . " The only evil man meets the only qualified man , " he whispered . " Not really-come in , John ! I said if there was only one evil man in the whole world , it 'd have to be Bill Reis . There 's a hell of a lot of evil men in the world . " <p> " Three in particular , " the man the president called John added . <p> " We have n't gotten to that yet , John , an ' I do n't think we will . " The president motioned toward a chair . " Sit down . " <p> " My error , Mr. President . I did n't know you were excluding the Senate . " John was forty plus , and starting to get fat . The thick , round lenses of his glasses gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the president told him . " Our problem with Bill Reis . " <p> " Sure . Do you know who he is , Dr. Chase ? That will save some time . " <p> Gideon shook his head . <p> " He was a major contributor to President Ingstrup 's first campaign . Also to his second , though that does n't really come into it . Major contributors are often given ambassadorships . Perhaps you 're aware of that . " <p> " My father was an ambassador , " Gideon remarked . " He was the U.S. ambassador to the only intelligent nonhumans known to science . . . . " He paused . " To the Wolders , " John said . <p> " There were older sciences , " Gideon murmured , " to which other intelligent races were known . So I 've heard . But , yes . He was ambassador to Woldercan , as you say . I was born there . No doubt you know . " <p> " We do . That was one of the reasons I suggested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it figured in our thinking . " <p> " Perhaps you might like to tell me the chief reason . " Gideon swept the remaining pictures toward him as he spoke . <p> " Your reputation . You specialize in solving problems every other expert declares are impossible or outside his area . You 're expensive , we realize- " <p> " Not as expensive as government . " Gideon was looking at the pictures as he spoke , glancing at each in turn , then laying it facedown on the president 's desk , his hands sure and swift . <p> John laughed . " You 've got us there . Of course not . But expensive . You 'd have the entire cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . " <p> " You can commit them ? " <p> " Yes . You would be an adjunct to our investigation . " <p> " How flattering . " Gideon 's gleam returned . " If I were to- " <p> The president interrupted . " Your dad was a patriot . I did n't know him personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He served this country ably as a private citizen an ' a diplomat . None of the people I talked to said you were much like him , but I 've found out that every man in the world gits certain traits from his folks . As I told John , your not resemblin ' your father on the surface tells me you 'll be like him down deeper . " <p> Nodding , Gideon swept the photographs into a neat stack and pushed the stack away . <p> " We ca n't give you a lot of money , " John said , " but we have other ways of rewarding people who help us . You would be recommended to friends of the president 's who might make use of you . If you 'd enjoy a professorship at one of our leading universities . . . " <p> " I 'd like to know what this man Reis has done , " Gideon murmured . " Well , think it over , Dr. Chase . You have a Ph.D. , do n't you ? Some private college in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . It would be easy . A professorship at Harvard or Princeton could be readily arranged . It would involve very little actual work and would convey a great deal of prestige . " <p> " What has Reis done ? " Gideon spoke to the president , not to John . <p> " He 's a spy , " the president said , " an ' that 's just for starters . We ca n't nab him ' cause we got no evidence . But he travels around . He stops at sensitive spots . He do n't stay long , but soon afterward our sources in-well , never you mind . In a certain foreign country , okay ? They tell us certain people there have got holt of somethin ' we were tryin ' to hold close to our vests . " Gideon shrugged . " Have him killed . " <p> " Not ' til we find out how he does it . " <p> John said , " He 's found a . aw in a security system we thought just about flawless-not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can exploit whenever he chooses . We 've got to know what it is . " <p> " That he can exploit , " Gideon murmured , " only when he is in close proximity to the facility in which your secret operations are being carried out . " " He 's a blackmailer , too , " the president said . " We know that . " " For money ? " Gideon 's gaze roved the room . <p> " Sometimes . " John cleared his throat . " More often for other things . Sexual favors , at times . Introductions and information . " <p> Gideon said , " You will have considered that he may be blackmailing someone at each of the industrial plants and laboratories he visits . They are plants or laboratories ? Most of them ? May I assume that ? " <p> " He would have to meet with them , or telephone them at least , " John said . Gideon looked amused . " E-mail them ? Write letters ? What about carrier pigeons ? " <p> The president 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This ai n't . t for humor . " <p> " Then you should n't tempt me to it . Neither of you should , and both of you have . " Gideon leaned back in his chair . " You 'll be listening in on telephone calls . Data mining ? Is n't that what you call it ? You 'd pick it up . You 're certainly tapping the lines of those laboratories or whatever , as well as the telephones of everyone privy to sensitive information . If you prattle about cell phones now , I shall go home . I 'm beginning to miss my little apartments already . " <p> John murmured , " Just assume that we 're already doing everything every ordinary person would think of . Because we are . Assume , too , that it 's not working . If it were , we would n't have called you . We do n't want you to guess what he 's doing . Any such guesses would be pure fantasy . Wild guesses are of no use . We 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The president grinned . " John 's guesses , mostly . Wild as blue quail , every one of ' em . Thought readin ' . Talkin ' to ghosts . " <p> " Neither are impossible . " Gideon sounded pensive . <p> " I have done both in the past , and will doubtless do both in the future . One or both may well explain Ambassador Reis 's success , although I doubt it . " <p> John began to say something ; the president silenced him with a gesture . " Did n't either one of us call him that . " <p> Gideon made a small , disgusted sound . " So now you 're wondering whether I 've been reading your mind . I have n't been , but you 'll have to take my word for that ; I ca n't prove it . John wanted to know whether I knew that major contributors are often rewarded with ambassadorships . He also told me that this man Reis had contributed liberally to an earlier president . The inference was obvious . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have been replaced years ago . I surmise that Reis was ambassador to Woldercan during the Ingstrup administration . Is that correct ? " " It is , " John said . <p> " Good . Is he spying for Woldercan ? To the best of your knowledge ? " <p> Speaking simultaneously , the president said , " Yes , " and John , " No . " <p> Gideon suppressed a smile . " Not proven , I take it . " <p> There was a pregnant silence while John waited for the president to speak . At last John said , " There are only two ways to communicate with Woldercan . " <p> The president muttered , " That we know of . " <p> " Ethermail can be monitored , " John continued . " It 's odd stuff-you probably know . Sometimes a second message gets there before the first one . Sometimes , well . . . " <p> " One picks up messages that have not yet been sent , " Gideon said . <p> " The whole question of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I mean , when you 've got worlds light-years apart . . . " <p> Gideon rescued him . " One the best astrophysicists suggest is insoluble . " <p> John nodded gratefully . " That 's right , and ethermail wo n't solve it . It only introduces more complications . I read once that congratulations from Earth on the birth of his son reached an ambassador on Woldercan before the baby was born . Back here , the State Department had received an ethermail from him saying his son had been born and even giving the son 's name . I do n't recall what it was- " " <p> Gideon . " He turned to the president . " Your advisor does n't think this man Reis is spying for Woldercan . You do . Do you have evidence ? " <p> " Evidence that will stand up in court ? No , sir . No , I do n't . Only I look at what a man does . " The president aimed an imaginary rifle , squinting at its sights . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do it ? Where does he drink , an ' where does he bed down ? Know them things an ' you can bag the wiliest old buck that ever corralled him a harem . " <p> Gideon nodded . " I 've been known to hunt men the same way . So have you , I 'm sure . What does Reis do ? " <p> " It ai n't what he does , it 's what he did . He started in the minute he got home from Woldercan , an ' he 's got tricks I know damned well he did n't have before he went . They turned him . Think that do n't happen ? Think again . " The president 's again was almost agin . " They turned him an ' they taught him , knowin ' I 'd want to pull him out an ' replace him with my own man . " <p> Gideon pursed his lips . " The news I 've heard and read-I confess I hear and read very little-has given me the impression that Woldercan is behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and fell . " We like to think so , but it 's hard to say . " <p> " Your opinion ? I was still a child , you understand , when my family left . " " Behind us in some areas and ahead in others . Ahead in biology , for example , but behind in physics . Behind us in military science-if it may be so called-but ahead in sociology . There are a number of areas I would n't want to guess about . " " Optics ? " Gideon did not smile , but his voice and eyes hinted at amusement . " That 's one of them . " <p> " Then tell me this , please . Where is Reis now ? " <p> John shook his head . " I do n't know . " <p> " In Washington ? Off in the desert at one of your secret sites ? " <p> " I do n't know , Dr. Chase , and I know of no one in government who does . " " Can you at least guess at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard a hopper going back to Woldercan ? " <p> " I told you . I do n't know . " <p> The president said , " We want you to find out how he does it an ' make him stop doin ' it . That 's what it comes down to . You 've heard what we 're offerin ' . What do you say ? " <p> " That there is a great deal you 're not telling me . You talked about hunting a wily buck , knowing his habits . Surely you 've had men , able agents , studying Reis . " " Will you do it ? " The president looked grim . " Do what we want ? " " More the point , " John added , " can you do it ? In your own opinion . " Gideon looked down at his own hands-long , dexterous hands , whose slender , ringless fingers might have belonged to a musician . " I 'll answer you first . What 's your last name , by the way ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , John , I wo n't answer you at all . I 'll answer our president , however . His name , at least , I know . Mr. President , I still do n't know enough to say whether I can do what you wish . You 've told me nothing about this man Reis 's crimes other than espionage and blackmail , for example , although other crimes have been hinted at , at least twice . As it happens , I know something of those already , assuming alchemy to be criminal . I feel sure you know much more . Empty the bag for me , and we can talk rationally . Otherwise , I 'll go . " <p> " I have a . le , " John said . " It 's long and detailed , and we did n't have time to get into all that . Agree , and I 'll give it to you . " <p> Gideon did not look at him . " As you have outlined my little assignment thus far , it 's senseless . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reis . Take him to a safe house . You would n't have to employ torture . There are drugs . There is even hypnosis , with which a skillful operator can do much more than the public has been led to believe . " <p> No one spoke . <p> " You have no comment ? " Gideon rose . " Very well . I 'll try with the trifling information you 've given me . For my service , I want that professorship and fifty million dollars . I want both in advance . " <p> The president snorted . <p> " A billion is nothing to you , but a billion is one thousand millions . I 'm asking one-twentieth of a billion , and you 'll have three-quarters of it back within a year through taxation . " <p> " When the job 's done , Dr. Chase . Not before . " <p> " You do n't trust me . Why in the world should I trust you ? I ca n't and I do n't . " Gideon turned and went out . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the White House , was whether he would be followed . <p> No , there were two questions . The first was whether he would be followed . The second was whether he was being followed already . Since he knew the answer to neither , he would have to act as though the answers were yes , and yes . <p> He had been followed before , and in some cases had succeeded in evading his followers . It would be important to begin as though he suspected nothing . <p> And to tire his unseen companion-or companions-if he could . The Secret Service agent who had accompanied him out of the White House offered to flag a cab for him on the far side of the concrete barriers that had long closed Pennsylvania Avenue . Gideon declined the suggestion , said something inane about the beauty of the stifling day , and declared that he would walk . <p> THE airport would certainly be watched , if the president had in fact ordered the FBI to monitor his movements . The same was true of his hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Had a bug been planted on his person ? It seemed unlikely , but it was certainly possible . It was even possible that the president had anticipated that he would filch one or more photos of Reis . Bugs could be planted in thick paper , such as photographic paper , and often were . When he felt ( or at least hoped ) that anyone shadowing him had been both discouraged and lost , he stopped at a camera store . It cost him eight dollars to make copies of the pictures he had stolen , image only ; when he had them , he ripped up the originals-wires , chips , and all-and threw them away . <p> Excerpted from An Evil Guest by Gene Wolfe . <p> Copyright 2008 by Gene Wolfe . <p> Published in 2008 by A Tom Doherty Associates
