Chapter One Heaven My name is Heaven Albright and my husband of two years is cheating on me . I 'm only twenty-five and you can argue that getting married at twenty-three is young , but I 'll argue right back that people marry out of college and even high school , so considering that , it 's not so young . Anyway , young or not ... the bastard is cheating on me . After I gave him the best years of my life . He 's cheating on me with someone he works with . A girl from his office who he did n't even think was cute at first , but after months of working long hours together and cultivating inside jokes , and commiserating over bad cafeteria food ... they 're bumping uglies . It sickens me to even think about it . He 'd always be so happy when he came home late from work , and you 'd think I would have caught on because nobody 's happy when they have to stay late at work . But I thought he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , but the minute he walked through the door and saw me , his bride of two years whom he loved and adored , all the day 's annoyances would disappear . Poof . But no . He would come home all smiles because he 'd just gotten his rocks off with some little skank who probably wore twinsets and laughed like a hyena at their stupid inside jokes . I hate twinsets , with theirmatching fabric and color coordination and phony reserve . It 's a known fact that twinsets are one of the most easily removed garments there is . Her name is probably Megan or Jessie , and she 's probably a couple years younger than me . She 's like me two years ago , but in a twinset . He 's re-creating me even before I 've had a chance to become the tired , old , sexually reluctant " ball and chain . " I resent that . I 'm not old . Marriage sucks . People who tell you that you stop having sex after you get married are right . You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say your I-dos and immediately stop . It takes a little time . Of course there 's the honeymoon , and the first few months of playing horny housewife and helpful handyman , or slave girl and surprisingly warmhearted barbarian , or Winnie the Pooh and the Magical Honeypot . But after a while you stop shaving your legs , and he stops noticing , and it seems more practical to try to get a good night 's sleep . Brady My name is Brady Gilbert , and I hate the window seat . Airplanes in general are a pain in the ass , and when I clearly stipulate that I want to sit on the aisle , a window seat is a personal affront that my secretary will be hearing about . If I had a secretary . I 'll just sit here and will nobody to sit in the aisle seat . That way I 'll not only have the aisle seat , but I 'll be able to achieve that **32;1310;TOOLONG sleeping position that inevitably ends up with a dead arm , stiff legs , and dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of complete strangers , no less . Do n't get me wrong ... sure , it 's nice to look out a window . But at what price ? Do I want to have to ask permission every time I need to take a piss ? It 's like needing a hall pass in school , but worse . These are strangers . And when I got a hall pass , I did n't inconvenience anyone . But to go to the bathroom on an airplane , I have to make awkward small talk and offer the obligatory apologetic shrug to a guy who 's been hogging my armrest . Then he gets up just enough to let me squeeze by . He 'll sigh as he gets up , not trying to make me feel guilty per se , but more like " Oh , these old bones of mine , " which is crap unless he 's over eighty . And he 's not , he 's just annoyed . Then to add insult to injury , as I maneuver out of the " now more room than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the tacky fabric headrest of the seat in front of me and get a glance from that person , too . I 'm making enemies left and right . Flight attendants hate me , too . Me and my devil-maycare bladder . Then when I come back , I have to do the dance all over again . Heaven help me if it 's a three-seater with a middle seat . Not to mention the etiquette question of which way to pass my neighbors-crotch first or ass first ? I hate the window seat . So I wait , and I will . People are still boarding , but so far , so good . I 've spotted the token hot chick that 's way out of my league anywhere but in my overactive imagination . This is going to be a long flight . There is always that one hot chick , no matter where you 're going , domestic or international , and never in the seat next to you . Or me . Well , this flight 's no different . In walks our token goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect her ass with the seat next to mine . Nothin ' . But she smiled at me , or at least I think she did . Maybe she was smiling at the flight attendant who 'd just given her an extra blanket . Just because . ( Continues ... )
