Theodore Roosevelt had carried the lethal dose of morphine with him for years . He had taken it to the American West , to the African savanna and , finally , down the River of Doubt  --  a twisting tributary deep in the Amazon rain forest . The glass vial was small enough to tuck into a leather satchel or slip into his luggage , nearly invisible beside his books , his socks and his eight extra pairs of eyeglasses . Easily overlooked , it was perhaps the most private possession of one of the world 's most public men . <P> In December 1913 , Roosevelt , then 55 , and a small group of men embarked on a journey to explore and map Brazil 's River of Doubt . Almost from the start , the expedition went disastrously wrong . Just three months later , as Roosevelt lay on a rusting cot inside his expedition 's last remaining tent listening to the roar of the river , he clutched the vial that he had carried for so long . Shivering violently , his body wracked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his own life . <P> In the span of a few days , Roosevelt , once America 's youngest President and among its most vigorous , had become a feverish , at times delirious , invalid . He was suffering from malaria and had developed a potentially deadly bacterial infection after slicing his leg on a boulder . In the sweltering rain forest , the cut had quickly become infected , causing his leg to redden and swell and sending his temperature soaring to 105F . At the same time , the expedition had reached a set of seemingly impassable rapids . Roosevelt 's Brazilian co-commander , Colonel Cndido Rondon , had announced that they would have to abandon their canoes and strike out into the jungle  --  every man for himself . " To all of us , " one of them wrote , " his report was practically a sentence of death . " For Roosevelt , who could barely sit up , much less fight his way through the rain forest , the plan was simply an impossibility . <P> He made his decision that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent walls , he summoned his remaining strength and called out to George Cherrie , a naturalist who , along with Roosevelt 's son Kermit , had been keeping a vigil over the feverish ex-President . Turning to his friend and his son , Roosevelt said , " Boys , I realize that some of us are not going to finish this journey . Cherrie , I want you and Kermit to go on . You can get out . I will stop here . " <P> Roosevelt had set sail for South America in the fall of 1913 , not quite a year after his failed attempt to regain the presidency . As a third-party candidate vying for a third term , he had split the Republican vote , putting a Democrat , Woodrow Wilson , in the White House for the first time in 16 years . After the election , Roosevelt found himself a pariah , ridiculed by his enemies and hated by many of his old Republican friends and backers .
