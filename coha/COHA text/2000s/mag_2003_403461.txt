There are over 122 HIV-AIDS drugs in development and mixing natural products with the powerful drugs used for AIDS can be dangerous . A qualified holistic physician offers the best results . // Despite all the advances of modern medicine , serious , incurable diseases are spreading around the world at an astonishing rate . HIV infection has gone beyond the gay community to heterosexuals and to babies from infected parents and AIDS has become a global epidemic in just 20 years . At this writing , more than 36 million people worldwide now live with HIV-AlDS-over 70 percent of them live in sub-Saharan Africa where AIDS-suppressing drugs are not widely obtainable and sate sex practices are not culturally accepted . So far a staggering 17 million people have died from AIDS . The body becomes unable to defend itself . AIDS and its cousin diseases are the result of immune system breakdown . Long believed to be caused by the HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) , a retro-virus that affects DNA and T cells , there is a growing body of evidence that severe AIDS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) an asymptomatic state ( when HIV is most often passed ) ; 2 ) a mononucleosis-like stage with one or more AIDS-related complexes ; 3 ) " full blown " AIDS . While the new HIV-AIDS drugs offer some hope , they are not free of side effects or serious risks . Most troubling : drug-resistant HIV strains can emerge during drug therapy and the viral load may skyrocket if the drugs are discontinued . Other severe drawbacks : * Diarrhea due to digestive and assimilation difficulty ( HIV itself compromises digestive function ) * Adult-onset diabetes * Birth defects in children born to infected mothers * Lipodystrophy syndrome ( fatty growths on the neck and back ) * Anemia and resulting chronic fatigue * Liver toxicity * Bone marrow toxicity ( AZT ) . If one decides to use a combination of orthodox and alternative treatments , it is important to seek out a knowledgeable naturopath . There are over 122 HIV-AIDS drugs in development and mixing natural products with the powerful drugs used for AIDS can be dangerous . A qualified holistic physician offers the best results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is fairly easy to transfer the HIV virus into the body through anal intercourse , more difficult through vaginal or oral sex . Powerful proteins in tears , saliva and pregnant women 's urine , friendly flora in the intestinal tract and HCl in the stomach produce a hostile environment that destroys HIV . There is no such protection in the colon . Suppression of the immune system is believed to occur when the HIV virus slips through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream . Normal immune response is to attack the virus with macrophages that then die and are removed through the lymphatic system . These toxic wastes ate finally dumped into the colon on its last leg of clearance from the body but in an unprotected colon without friendly bacteria or good defensive pH environment , new HIV viruses hatch from the dead macrophages and multiply in the feces , repeating the cycle again and again . The immune system can not detect the virus in the colon and does not marshal its forces until the infection is in the bloodstream , often too late if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culprit in the AIDS connection . Immunosuppression comes before HIV . Syphilis is usually present in AIDS victims , as are parasites and other viruses that set the stage for AIDS and related complexes . In fact , parasites are a cofactor in AIDS development . If the lifestyle is immunosuppressing , parasites can easily take hold . If one is frequently diagnosed with a bacterial infection and has used antibiotics that have n't helped , have the stool tested for parasites . Amoebic parasites allow the virus to spread by rupturing immune defense cells that engulf the HIV virus in an effort to destroy it . Parasites also worsen drug side effects and reduce the body 's capacity to benefit from the drug . Some physicians report that when they treat the parasite infections , the HIV viral load goes down to undetectable levels . One can also continually be re-infected . Destructive immunesuppressing lifestyle elements like continual exposure to HIV and other STDs through sexual excess and multiple sex partners and sharing needles or drug " snort straws " for drugs expose people to the virus by putting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to AIDS because the liver is so weakened it can not play its part in resisting infection . HIV also predisposes one to hepatitis by grinding down liver defenses . The symptoms of AIDS . Symptoms can appear anywhere from six months to three years after infection . Here are the early symptoms : * Diarrhea that lasts longer than a week * Swollen glands and lymph nodes in the neck area , armpits and groin * Inability to heal even minor ailments like a small cut , bruise or cold * Unusual fatigue * White patches in the mouth and difficulty swallowing ( thrush ) * Nail ringworm fungus . Continuing symptoms mean that AIDS is undeniable : * Purplish blotches that look like hard bruises occurring on or under the skin , inside the mouth , nose , eyelids or rectum that do not go away ( Kaposi 's sarcoma ) * Pneumonia , swollen glands that never go down * Persistent dry , hacking cough ( unrelated to smoking ) * Fevers and night sweats that last for days or weeks * Severe , unexplained fatigue * Persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Memory loss , confusion and depression * Personality changes Is there hope for people who are HIV positive ? In the U.S. an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people are living with HIV . One-quarter of them do n't even know it . Testing " antibody positive " does not mean that one has AIDS , only that he/she has been exposed to the HIV virus . Being HIV positive docs not even mean that one will develop AIDS . It is a warning , not a sentence . Research shows that at least five percent of people diagnosed HIV positive never develop full-blown AIDS . Most infected people coexist with HIV . The face of AIDS has changed dramatically within the last five years . Protease inhibitor " cocktails " and genetic modifying drugs , coupled with a healthy diet , elimination of recreational drugs and responsible sexual behavior has improved HIV status . HIV positive people are recognizing that the destructive lifestyle factors leading to their diagnosis can be changed to prevent further re-infection and that lifestyle therapies can greatly improve their health condition and help keep them symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught early and lifestyle and nutritional healing measures are embraced , HIV infection can be effectively managed and the patient can live a full , productive life . What does it take to survive AIDS ? Thousands of long-term AIDS survivors are free of HIV symptoms . In every case I know , the survivor consciously decided to take charge of his or her own life and healing . All energies were channeled into the therapies that the survivors thought were right for them . They faced reality , acknowledged that there was no silver bullet , realized that the process would be long and hard and that the battle would take great courage . Holistic approach . Holistic therapies show more promise than ever for AIDS and its related immune syndromes . Alternative treatment programs are enormous factors in showing that HIV infection and AIDS are no longer inevitably fatal as they once were . Holistic treatments are often seen as the key to abating symptoms , slowing the advance of the virus itself and improving the quality of life . Success is bringing more expertise into the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapists , nutritional counselors and others . HIV itself is n't deadly . It weakens the immune system to the point where its T-4 reserves are exhausted and ca n't fight . Thousands of research papers show that immune system failure which leads to AIDS directly correlates to specific vitamin , mineral and amino acid deficiencies . Malnutrition is thus the number one reason for low immune response . A high resistance , immune-building diet is the key to health . AIDS victims need about 4000 calories a day , double the normal amount , to sustain body weight . Also the intestinal environment must be changed to create a hostile site for the HIV virus . The following liquid and fresh foods diet represents only the first " crash course " stage of the change from cooked to living foods . It is for the ill person who needs dramatic measuresconcentrated defense strength in a short time . It has also been extremely helpful in keeping an HIV positive person symptom free , even in symptom recession during full-blown AIDS . My diet program helps prevent attendant diseases associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV lives on dead and waste matter . ( AIDS experts theorize that HIV feeds off undigested proteins in the colon . ) For several months at least , eat a vegetarian diet , low in dairy , yeast breads and saturated fats . Meats , fried foods , dairy products ( except yogurt and kefir ) , coffee , alcohol , salty , sugary foods and all refined foods must be eliminated . Recreational drugs should be eliminated , as well as unnecessary prescription drugs . The ultra purity of this diet controls multiple allergies and sensitivities that occur in the autoimmune state yet it still supplies the needs of a body that is suffering great nutrient deprivation . For most people , this way of eating is a radical change with major limitations but the health improvement against HIV is excellent . Remember : This diet is only a " jump start .

Diet improvement is the key to keeping HIV infection from becoming AIDS . Intestinal pH environment must be changed for disease protection . 1 Extreme toxicity , fatigue and malabsorption of AIDS forestalls a liquid detox plan-too harsh for such a weakened system . Three glasses of fresh carrot juice and a cup of potassium essence ( see below ) daily keeps the detox ongoing . 2 The diet should have the best possible nutrition . A modified macrobiotic diet is ideal for resistance and immune strength . Produce should be fresh and organically grown when possible . 3 No fried , fatty foods ( they aggravate diarrhea ) . A low sugar , low fat diet is best if one has fatty accumulations related to drug therapy . Coconut oil is easily digested and has anti-HIV activity . Avoid concentrated sweeteners and chemicalized foods of all kinds . Avoid protein from dairy and red meat , especially fried meat , difficult to digest for people with HIV . Limit high gluten foods : wheat bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked goods . 4 Eat foods with anti-parasitic enzymes : cranberries , pineapple , papaya. 5 Flush with fresh lemon juice ( a specific for HIV ) or six to eight glasses of mild herb teas and bottled water daily . Detoxification Bodywork : * One must detoxify the liver for holistic healing to be effective . ( See my liver cleansing program at www.healthyhealing.com ) * Remove infected feces from the intestinal tract .

( HIV can be spread with shared " snort straws . " ) * Make sure any blood transfusion plasma has been tested for HIV virus ( a regular practice in the U.S. ) . Are the new HIV home tests a good choice ? Pharmacies now carry HIV tests , costing $40 to $50 , that you can perform privately in your home . People who are reluctant to get HIV screening from a doctor may find home tests a good choice .
