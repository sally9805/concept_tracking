Introduction : Every Patient ? s Nightmare // Barbara Lessing stared out the window at the snowy field behind the hospital . The afternoon sky was dark with yet more snow to come . She looked at the slender figure in the bed . Her daughter , Crystal , barely twenty-two years old and healthy her entire life , was now-somehow-dying . The young woman had been in the Nassau University Medical Center ICU for two days ; she ? d been seen by a dozen doctors and had scores of tests , yet no one seemed to have the slightest idea of just what was killing her . // It all started at the dentist ? s office . Crystal had had a couple of impacted wisdom teeth taken out the month before . But even after the teeth were gone , the pain persisted . She ? d called her mother halfway across the state just about every day to complain . " Call your dentist , " she ? d urged her daughter . And she had . Finally . // The dentist gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that her mouth felt better-but she didn ? t . She was tired . Achy . For the next week she ? d felt like she was coming down with something . Then the bloody diarrhea started . And then the fevers . Why didn ? t you go to the doctor sooner ? the trim middle-aged woman scolded her daughter silently . // Barbara had gotten a call from a doctor in the emergency room of this suburban hospital the night before . Her daughter was ill , he told her . Deathly ill . She drove to Syracuse , caught the next flight to New York City , and drove to the sprawling academic medical center on Long Island . In the ICU , Dr. Daniel Wagoner , a resident in his second year of training , ushered her in to see her daughter . Crystal was asleep , her dark curly hair a tangled mat on the pillow . And she looked very thin . But most terrifying of all-she was yellow . Highlighter yellow . // Wagoner could feel his heart racing as he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed . The bright unnatural yellow of her skin was shiny with sweat . She had a fever of nearly 103 ? . Her pulse was rapid but barely palpable and she was breathing much faster than normal despite the oxygen piped into her nose . She slept most of the time now and when awake she was often confused about where she was and how she had gotten there . // To a doctor , nothing is more terrifying than a patient who is dying before your eyes . Death is part of the regular routine of the ICU . It can be a welcome relief to the patient , or to his family . Even a doctor may accept it for a patient whose life can be prolonged no longer . But not for a young girl who was healthy just weeks ago . These doctors had done everything they could think of but still there was a fear-a reasonable fear-that they ? d missed some clue that could mean the difference between life and death for this young woman . She shouldn ? t die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knew that she might . // Crystal ? s thin chart was filled with numbers that testified to how very ill she was . Wagoner had been through the chart a dozen times . Virtually every test they ? d run was abnormal . Her white blood cell count was very high , suggesting an infection . And her red blood cell count was low-she had barely half the amount of blood she should have . She ? d gotten a transfusion in the emergency room and another after she was moved to the ICU , but her blood count never budged . Her kidneys weren ? t working . Her clotting system wasn ? t either . Her yellow skin was covered in bruises and her urine was stained deep red . // Sometimes , if you just work hard enough to keep a patient alive-to keep the blood circulating , the lungs oxygenating , the blood pressure high enough-the body will be able to survive even a vicious illness . These are the miracles brought by technological advances . Sometimes , but not this time . The ICU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did their best to shore up her damaged clotting system ; she got pressers ( medications designed to increase blood pressure ) and fluids to help her kidneys . She was on several broad-spectrum antibiotics . And yet none of that was enough . She needed a diagnosis . Indeed , she was dying for a diagnosis . // This book is about the process of making that diagnosis , making any diagnosis . So often this crucial linchpin of medicine goes unnoticed and undescribed , yet it is often the most difficult and most important component of what physicians do . As pervasive as medicine has become in modern life , this process remains mostly hidden , often misunderstood , and sometimes mistrusted . In movies and novels it ? s usually the one-liner that separates the fascinating symptoms from the initiation of the life-saving therapy . On television it ? s the contemporary version of Dr. McCoy ? s ( Star Trek ) magic diagnostic device ( his tricorder ) that sees all , tells all . But in real life , the story of making a diagnosis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // And these are stories that doctors tell . Just as Sherlock Holmes or Nick Charles ( the hero of the Thin Man mysteries ) or Gil Grissom ( CSI ) delights in explaining the crime to victims and colleagues , doctors take pleasure in recounting the completed story of their complex diagnoses , stories where every strange symptom and unexpected finding , every mystifying twist and nearly overlooked clue , finally fit together just right and the diagnosis is revealed . // In this book I ? ll take you into those conversations and onto the front lines where these modern medical mysteries are solved-or sometimes not . // Just a hundred years ago , journalist and acerbic social critic Ambrose Bierce defined the word " diagnosis " in his Devil ? s Dictionary as " A physician ? s forecast of disease by taking the patient ? s pulse and purse . " And that was true for most of human history . Until very recently , diagnosis was much more art than science . // But since Ambrose Bierce wielded his rapier pen , there has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understand the pathology behind them . In the era in which Bierce wrote , Sir William Osler , considered by many to be the father of American medicine , was able to write a comprehensive summary of all the known diseases in his 1,100-page masterwork , The Principles and Practice of Medicine . These days each tiny sub-branch of medicine could provide as many pages on its super-specialized knowledge alone . // At the birth of medicine , millennia ago , diagnosis ( the identification of the patient ? s disease ) and prognosis ( the understanding of the disease ? s likely course and outcome ) were the most effective tools a doctor brought to the patient ? s bedside . But beyond that , little could be done to either confirm a diagnosis or alter the course of the disease . Because of this impotence in the face of illness , the consequences of an incorrect diagnosis were minimal . The true cause of the illness was often buried with the patient . // In more recent history , medicine has developed technologies that have transformed our ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily in the nineteenth century-was the starting point . The indirect evidence provided by touching , listening to , and seeing the body hinted at the disease hidden under the skin . Then the X-ray , developed at the start of the twentieth century , gave doctors the power to see what they had previously only imagined . That first look through the skin , into the inner structures of the living body , laid the groundwork for the computerized axial tomography ( CT ) scan in the 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) in the 1990s . Blood tests have exploded in number and accuracy , providing doctors with tools to help make a definitive diagnosis in an entire alphabet of diseases from anemias to zoonoses. // Better diagnosis led to better therapies . For centuries , physicians had little more than compassion with which to help patients through their illnesses . The development of the randomized controlled trial and other statistical tools made it possible to distinguish between therapies that worked and those that had little to offer beyond the body ? s own recuperative powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent and effective tools to treat a broad range of diseases . // Much of the research of the past few decades has examined which therapies to use and how to use them . Which medication , what dose , for how long ? Which procedure ? What ? s the benefit ? These are all questions commonly asked and that can now be regularly and reliably answered . Treatment guidelines for many diseases are published , available , and regularly used . And despite concerns and lamentations about " cookbook medicine , " these guidelines , based on a rapidly growing foundation of evidence , have saved lives . These forms of evidence-based medicine allow patients to benefit from the thoughtful application of what ? s been shown to be the most effective therapy . // But effective therapy depends on accurate diagnosis . We now have at our disposal a wide range of tools-new and old-with which we might now make a timely and accurate diagnosis . And as treatment becomes more standardized , the most complex and important decision making will take place at the level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient ? s story and exam suggest a likely suspect and the technology of diagnosis rapidly confirms the hunch . An elderly man with a fever and a cough has an X-ray revealing a raging pneumonia . A man in his fifties has chest pain that radiates down his left arm and up to his jaw , and an EKG ( electrocardiogram ) or blood test bears out the suspicion that he is having a heart attack . A teenage girl on the birth control pill comes in complaining of shortness of breath and a swollen leg , and a CT scan proves the presence of a massive pulmonary embolus . This is the bread and butter of medical diagnosis-cases where cause and effect tie neatly together and the doctor can almost immediately explain to patient and family whodunit , how , and sometimes even why . // But then there are the other cases : patients with complicated stories or medical histories ; cases where the symptoms are less suggestive , the physical exam unrevealing , the tests misleading . Cases in which the narrative of disease strays off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have alibis , and the diagnosis is elusive . For these , the doctor must don her deerstalker cap and unravel the mystery . It is in these instances where medicine can rise once again to the level of an art and the doctor-detective must pick apart the tangled strands of illness , understand which questions to ask , recognize the subtle physical findings , and identify which tests might lead , finally , to the right diagnosis . //
