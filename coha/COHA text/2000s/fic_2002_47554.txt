BEFORE BREAKFAST IN Doctor Petru Groza , as they were packing their bicycles , Joanna had screamed at her sisters , demanded they stop waiting for her along the route , had thrown a ferocious , bratty tantrum as she had n't done once in the four years of her husband 's deterioration . Joanna had awoken loopy with hunger , which probably triggered the outburst , but even after eating she did n't feel like apologizing . At fourteen o'clock Romanian time , when Joanna stopped at a roadside cafe , Clarice and Margaret were nowhere to be seen , so she must have gotten her point across . Compared to her athletic older sisters and their husbands , Joanna was a small , slow biker , and when she knew the others were waiting ahead she felt guilty investigating villages , cooling her hands and face in streams , looking in shops in hopes of finding something edible . She 'd never considered herself adventuresome ; she just wanted to be left alone or in the company of strangers . <p> In the open-air cafe where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched over separate tables , each drinking brownish wine out of a jar . Joanna took off her helmet and gloves , tugged her stretchy shorts to make them cover more of her thighs , and walked to the counter . The place was kind of pretty , set beneath an arbor covered with grape vines that afforded shade to the metal tables , painted , like the house to which the cafe was attached , a bright , chalky blue . Joanna pointed at a box of biscuits on a shelf , but the proprietress picked up the box and shook it to show it was empty , for display only . <p> " Vin ? " asked the woman . Wine ? <p> Joanna shook her head . " Chay , " she said . It rhymed with sigh . Tea . <p> The woman 's dark hair was arranged in striking resemblance to Mrs. Ceausescu 's matronly ' do in the portrait beside the door leading inside-a sort of bouffant . On the far side of the door hung a likeness of Mrs. Ceausescu 's husband , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exhaust , the proprietress smiled apologetically . She attempted to write on a slip of paper . the amount Joanna needed to pay , but even after she shook her pen , still there was no ink . Joanna held out a handful of change , steel lei coins and aluminum bani , and the proprietress selected about four cents ' worth . <p> Joanna indicated her water bottle and asked for ah-pah , then followed the proprietress 's finger to an open well just outside . Joanna had learned maybe a dozen Romanian words , and most seemed no more real than the tissue-paper currency and worn-down coins for which she 'd traded sturdy American dollars . The word for water was an exception  --  needing to drink eight or ten liters a day made it real . Joanna cranked up a wooden bucket , filled her bottle , and dumped the rest onto the ground as their guide , Bogdan , had taught them-he said the air here poisoned the water . <p> If Joanna had n't left her camera in the hotel in Oradea , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film the melancholy of the mule-drawn carts , hobbled horses grazing , women dragging wooden  --  tined rakes across hillsides . Though she could n't have much in common with them , she felt a camaraderie with the raking women and those minding the shops with empty shelves . Even though she could n't speak to them beyond the words for hello , water , and America , even though they stared longingly at the gold necklace David had given her , she liked their company . If the women 's husbands got David 's disease , they probably died in the early stages , before they became paralyzed . <p> Margaret and her husband were doctors and advisors to an aid agency headquartered in Chicago , and upon returning they would make a report about the health conditions they observed in Transylvania . Clarice was a social worker and responded to Joanna 's fascination with the women by providing facts : The incidence of death during childbirth , she told Joanna , was the highest in Europe , as was the child mortality rate . " A lot of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole group had been biking together , they 'd seen a boy with the bowed legs signifying rickets . Just beyond the boy , Clarice had pulled over and wept into her hands , shocking their guide , who glanced to the men for help . Both of Joanna 's sisters ' husbands were handsome , well-traveled men who looked forward to fathering children with their strong wives ; Joanna had assumed she 'd have children too , but her husband , back home in Chicago , was now having difficulty even chewing his food . <p> Because this was Joanna 's first bike trip , she was happily surprised to find she could keep pedaling at her slow pace all day , even in the intense heat , but the resulting hunger came as a shock . Along with the others , she had breakfasts and dinners in the hotel restaurants , but the food tasted bad , heavy and greasy , impossible to eat much of in the hot mornings and evenings . According to her sisters , such food was not good for bicycling , which required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasta , they said ; Joanna did n't know what she longed for . Last night in Doctor Petru Groza they were each served a roasted half-chicken with no more than a mouthful of meat clinging to its bones . Joanna had seen such chickens , harassed balls of feathers , pecking along the shoulder of the road for bugs and worms , scattering into ditches as she pedaled over potholes . For breakfast this morning they got mamaliga , a cornmeal mush , served not , as before , with liquid sheep's-cheese , but with a slick of pork fat over the top , as clear as the poured-glass windows of the Moon Church in Oradea . Joanna had spooned the grease into an ashtray in the center of the table while their guide watched . Bogdan , provided by the national tourist bureau , ate everything on his plate ; he devoured the bread , which was heavy and dirty-tasting , as though baked inside factory smokestacks , and he stirred his shiny fat right into the corn mush . <p> While Joanna was shaking her water bottle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cafe moved from his table and sat in a chair beside her . From a distance he 'd appeared ancient , but by the look of the small , bright eyes set in his ruined face , he probably was n't over fifty . Joanna 's husband , who was thirty-three and used to have a tall , loose frame that made him appear younger than his age , now looked eighty , curled into himself in his wheelchair . <p> The cafe man stank of sour wine and sweat . " Kent ? " he asked . <p> Joanna shook her head , clutched her water bottle . <p> The man looked into her face as though searching there for a fellow conspirator . He smiled to show his few remaining teeth , which were small and dark . " Kent ? " he repeated and raised two mangled fingers to his lips , making a stunted V. Joanna stared at the digits , both severed above the lower joint , the skin pinched and bluish over the ends . For the first time she wished she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a raspy voice filled with drunken disgust , the man shouted to the other men in the cafe , but neither even looked over . Joanna waved flies from her face , wondering how the man was n't bothered that a half-dozen or so had gathered near his eyes . He was dressed in a worn and patched suit jacket over a threadbare undershirt and flare  --  legged pants cinched tight at the waist , the same clothes worn by other men in other Transylvanian villages . The man leaned toward Joanna and grabbed her upper arm with his damaged hand . <p> " Kent , " he repeated a third time , and tightened his grip . His slightly crossed eyes seemed both stupid and intensely focused . He watched Joanna , as though testing her . He could n't have been more than a few inches taller than she was , and she probably outweighed him , but she found herself unable even to try to pull away . She wanted to yell " Stop ! " or " Help ! " but she did n't know either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen . She imagined the two fat-bellied policemen who patrolled her Wicker Park neighborhood-black Officer Washington , white Officer Kroll-driving up in a gleaming squad car , a multiethnic , three-dimensional vision of ordinary American wealth , standing out against this flat , poor backdrop . <p> But Joanna had no policemen here , no language , not even a passport to prove who she was-Bogdan had taken her papers ahead to the hotel . She could be held prisoner , hobbled like one of those mares , or chained to a wooden rake on a hillside . Meanwhile David would die at home , silent and motionless , and without ever feeling the touch of her hands again . Joanna and her husband had not made love in ten months . When she 'd realized they never would again , she felt guilty about her self-pity , which had nearly replaced the compassion in her . More recently , though , Joanna found she did n't even feel self-pity anymore , that it had been replaced by the guilt and then by something like nothing . <p> The drunk man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container that might burst open and spill goods . The proprietress remained inside , slow with the tea , and the other men still leaned over their own tables not paying attention . <p> " That hurts , " Joanna finally managed to whisper and tried to peel away the fingers , but they were fastened machinelike . " Let go ! " she yelled , alarming herself if not the drunk man . With her foot she pushed against his chair , tipping it . The two other men turned as the drunk tried but failed to catch himself . <p> As his chair clattered to the concrete , Joanna grabbed her water bottle , ran out , and climbed onto her bike . For the first time since the border , she was feeling the strangeness she had expected in a strange country , and she felt pity for the man 's wife , if he had one . She pedaled away as quickly as she 'd ever pedaled past a man who might be a mugger on an empty stretch of South Side Chicago lakefront . She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafe fell farther behind , she slackened her pace . There was little hope of catching up with her sisters so she could relate what had happened . And the farther away she got , the less she wanted to tell them  --  they 'd worry ; they 'd insist on biking with her . <p> Up ahead , she saw a cluster of children , some sitting on the curb hugging their knees , others drifting into the road as lookouts . Their deeply tanned skin was looted from the low smokestacks and dusty from the road . As Joanna approached , the sitting ones stood , and they all chanted , " Goo-mel Goo-mel " The cyclists at the front of the pack might not be accosted , but by the time Joanna came through , the children of a village were often lying in wait like this . The guidebook had warned about the national gum fetish , so she had brought five hundred pieces of Bazooka . Clarice and Margaret threw fistfuls of gum away from themselves so that children ran to grab it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobbed by kids . <p> She stopped and let the dozen or so children cluster around . Back home , children ignored her , and she never knew how to lure their attention away from video games or Barbie dolls , but here they pressed their bodies against her , nervous , excited , muscular like woods creatures . They touched her bike and tugged at her clothes . When one girl with an eggy white scar on the back of her hand unzipped a saddlebag , Joanna shook her finger in exaggerated disapproval . " Nu-nu . " She placed gum into outstretched hands until she was certain each child had several pieces , then she stroked their warm , bristly heads , which were mostly shaved , boys and girls alike , perhaps against lice . She had n't chewed gum in years , but in an attempt to quell her hunger she unwrapped a piece and set off . <p> Joanna 's sisters were expert travelers , and if she 'd listened to them , she 'd have brought more to eat . Her sisters had planned everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting that she go , had even asked David 's mother to come stay while she was gone . Joanna needed to get away for her own health , Margaret had said , for there was a long haul ahead-David needed her not to burn out . Margaret did n't say this like a sister ; she said it like a doctor . Joanna had already taken up bicycling ; she used to walk around her neighborhood , along Lincoln and then over to the lake , but since the doctors named the disease that would paralyze and slowly kill her husband , Joanna wanted to get as far away as possible in her hour of exercise , and she did n't care whether the wind off the lake was with or against her , just so long as it blew . <p> Chewing the gum was only making her hungrier . Her sisters carried shatterproof jars of peanut butter and Ziploc bags of granola to supplement hotel meals . They would share their food if she asked , but Joanna did n't want to admit she had n't brought enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she 'd eaten three at the eighthour Hungarian/Romanian border crossing . " Guns , drugs , Bibles ? " the guard had asked . Joanna had smiled , thought he was kidding , until Clarice frowned and nudged her . " Tell him no . " Clarice had told her that Ceausescu made typewriters illegal too-owning one was supposedly punishable by death-but such information was too outrageous to absorb . Clarice also said listening devices would be in their hotel rooms , so they should be careful . Joanna had marveled at the prospect of anyone giving a damn what she said . <p> By now her sisters and their husbands were probably in the hotel in Deva , a town built around a steep hill with Dacian and Roman ruins at the top . In the guidebook photo the hill rose out of the center of town like a lone breast , one whose companion had shriveled away . Last night outside the hotel in Doctor Petru Groza , Bogdan had stared south , toward the green hills in which Joanna now biked : " They say these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattlesnakes . " The women squinted against the setting sun and smiled , waiting for him to explain why rattlesnakes would be in Europe , but then Bogdan blinked as if out of a daydream . Though they were outside the restaurant , well away from listening devices or potential spies , Bogdan glanced around as if he 'd let slip a state secret and announced that group members might find for sale in Deva a three-volume set of the political theory of the Great Leader . " One of few places such volumes are available outside of Bucharest . " <p> Her sisters had told her she must not talk about the government or even say the president 's name aloud , but Joanna had been hungry and the political nonsense annoyed her . " Bogdan , you know we do n't care about your great leader . ' And why do n't you ever say the guy 's name ? Why do n't you just say Ceausescu ? " Joanna pronounced the name loudly and distinctly , Chow-chess-koo . A silence settled on them like dust from a passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Bogdan . " <p> " Tell us about the rattlesnakes , " Joanna said . Though she 'd only known Bogdan a few days , his Boy Scout demeanor wearied her the way Clarice 's Girl Scout goodness always had . Poverty was all around them , yet Bogdan kept saying everything in Romania was great . Kids had rickets , for chrissakes ; typewriters were contraband . <p> " I am mistake about snakes . " <p> " What about vampires , then ? " Joanna asked . <p> " These are folktales of foolish . " <p> " Dracula is real , though , " said Joanna . A few days from now they would visit the castle of Dracula at Brasov . David had asked her to take a picture there ; back when he had flesh on his bones he was a sometimes fan of old monster movies , but now that he was being devoured cell by cell , Joanna knew his enthusiasm to be faked . <p> " Dracula , " Bogdan said , pronouncing it Dra-cool-ya , " was this prince who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't from Transylvania , then how do you know ? " <p> Clarice and Margaret glared at Joanna like identical twins , their tan , soon-to-be-childbearing arms crossed over their chests . Her sisters always had each other in a way that made Joanna think they did n't even need husbands . <p> Bogdan coughed and cleared his throat . " My grandfather is from such places . " <p> " Is that why you were chosen to be our guide ? " Clarice asked gently , trying to defuse the conversation . <p> " I am chosen because I have good bicycle . " <p> As Joanna cycled away from the cafe and goo-me children , toward Deva , she found the going difficult . She stopped several times to check her tires and brakes and once even knelt to feel the road with her hand , for it seemed she might be sinking in tar . That 's when she realized she no longer was wearing a helmet or gloves , both of which she 'd left at the cafe . She would miss the soft gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined the Kent man pulling the smooth synthetic leather over his terrible hands . As for the helmet , she 'd survived biking without one when she was a kid-and kids here did n't even have bicycles . She spit out her old gum and chewed a new piece , which made her still hungrier . <p> She biked slowly for hours without passing a stream , though the stones in the roadside ditch seemed to have been recently washed by water . The heat and humidity pressed on her ; sweat and dirt collected on the inside of her elbows , on the back of her neck , in the creases of her belly formed by hunching over the handlebars . Plum trees lined the road , stripped of fruit except on the topmost branches . On the trunks were painted white skulls and crossbones . She wondered how Bogdan would explain those . <p> Her frustration with the mysteriously difficult biking lasted until she passed a chalky blue marker , shaped like a rocket , that read 524 meters . The grade was so shallow and steady that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first mountain pass , high above the flat land of Illinois and on the other side of the world from the disease . She knew she should work harder to remember David without his disease , when they used to walk bumping hips through Lincoln Park Zoo , when they 'd checked out fish-lure earrings and fake Rolexes along Maxwell Street , but knowing that the sickness must have been in David even then spoiled the memories . Such a disease was supposed to come after decades ; David had begun to die within months of their wedding , and the process of remembering him healthy seemed artificial , as though she were trying to reconstruct him from parts . <p> On a bench a quarter-mile past the rocket marker sat a sullen , round  --  eyed teenage girl in drab , stretchy pants who watched over two pint jars of cream . A cardboard sign leaning against one of the jars read 1.25 lei , about thirteen cents at the official exchange rate , about a penny at the black-market rate . Just outside Oradea , Bogdan had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass jar like this and , after offering it around , glugged the whole thing . When he handed it back , yellowish cream coated his lips . At the memory , Joanna felt a reflex gag . Margaret had pulled her aside and instructed her never to drink such milk : It was unpasteurized , bacteria-laden , and dangerous to adults who had n't grown up with those germs . <p> " Boo-na zee-wah , " good day , Joanna said , waving to the girl with exaggerated cheerfulness . The girl mouthed " Zee-wah " without smiling , without any expression . As Joanna struggled up the road , the girl 's eyes stayed fixed on her , as though Joanna were a dull-witted dancing bear lagging behind the rest of her troupe at a circus the girl was forced to attend . <p> Farther up the mountain , Joanna spotted a young woman sitting on a log bench at a lookout , breast-feeding a child who must have been four or five years old . Her white blouse hung off her shoulder , and she wore a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed at the hem . Her feet were bare . The boy stopped nursing and turned to watch Joanna pass , revealing his pinched face and his mother 's bare , drained breast . The mother tipped her head back , stretching out a long neck toward the woods and the sky , lifted a cigarette over the boy 's head , and inhaled deeply . <p> When the grade steepened dramatically , Joanna shifted into her granny gear for the rest of the climb . Though it was still afternoon , the sky darkened , and during the next hour a storm as black as any Transylvania movie backdrop unrolled across the heavens . Switchbacks sent her weaving over the mountainside . Training along the lakefront had n't prepared her for this . Thunder boomed over the next peak as she recalled the relief map in her atlas depicting the ridge of Carpathians that lay before her , a terrifying obstacle she had n't let herself think about . Distant music drifted in and out as she wove upward-a fiddle , a tambourine maybe , echoes of voices . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke from a barbecue . In college she 'd attended a concert of Hungarian gypsy music along with her folk-dancing group  --  she used to folk-dance twice a month , which is where she met David , but she 'd given it up when he did ( it was a long drive to the South Side ) , and now at home he preferred to listen to classical-music that dulled Joanna 's senses . <p> The top of the pass was indicated by a third blue marker-928 meters-this one stuck in the ground beside a wooden shelter , maybe a bus stop , which was occupied by an old woman and her cow . The sky was the color of a gray cat , and stray raindrops pelted Joanna 's bare legs and arms . She pulled her bike under cover just before the deluge , took a seat beside the woman on the bench and smiled . The woman smiled back , closemouthed . " Boo-na zee-wa , " Joanna said . <p> The woman opened her mouth to reveal a toothless cavern and laughed , apparently at Joanna 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . Joanna shook her head , but if the woman was truly disappointed about not getting cigarettes , she did n't show it . The cow switched its tail at some flies . The old woman picked up Joanna 's arm and squinted at her sport wristwatch , then reached across Joanna 's chest and with her knob-jointed fingers handled the gold cross Joanna wore on a thin chain around her neck . David had watched as his mother presented the necklace to Joanna ; he 'd spoken with a strained good humor , said it would keep her safe from vampires . She 'd kissed him and felt his lips tremble in their effort to return the kiss . <p> The boniness of the old woman 's hands made Joanna 's breasts look absurdly round and swollen , almost pornographic , as though they might burst out of her bra and tank shirt . Joanna dug some gum from her pack and gave it to the woman before reflecting that without teeth she could n't chew it . Then Joanna gave her a toothpick that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . The woman slipped the gifts into a pocket . Her housedress was pale , the pattern worn away , but the bottoms of the pockets had been resewn with coarse black thread in a way that reminded Joanna of surgical stitches . In response to the gifts , the woman leaned forward , nearly off the bench , and grabbed the cow 's udder and jostled it , as if to show Joanna how full it was . Joanna imagined leaning down , closing her mouth around a teat the size of a child 's penis , swallowing mouthfuls of frothy whole milk . The woman pointed to Joanna 's water bottle , and though Joanna 's stomach rumbled , she shook her head-bacteria aside , the milk would sour the plastic , and with every sip of water she took in this country , she would taste that sourness . <p> The two women sat silently for some time , the cow 's head bobbing between them , rain banging a wild message on the tin roof . When it finally began to peter out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She trained her ears on the sound , so she was startled when she felt the woman 's callused grip on her leg . The woman handled Joanna 's exposed thigh the way she might have inspected a salted ham in a market , and then she slapped Joanna 's leg hard enough to leave a handprint . Joanna rubbed the red mark , unsure what had happened , unsure if she should be offended . The woman laughed and elbowed Joanna , then pulled up her dress to reveal , as though it were the punch line to a joke , a thin , scarred leg striped with varicose veins . The woman slapped the withered thing and tossed her dress back over it . Beside the old woman 's leg , Joanna 's plump , muscled thigh looked almost edible . <p> Joanna was trying to conceal her embarrassment when she heard the rumbling in the distance . The noise continued to grow louder until it was nearly unbearable . Had the old woman not been sitting so calmly , Joanna would have run into the woods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain pass , a convoy of drab green trucks and tanklike personnel carriers appeared . Long-barreled guns stuck out their fronts . As the vehicles , probably fifty all together , passed and turned the corner , toward Deva , Joanna saw the silhouettes of young men sitting on benches in the backs of the trucks . Despite their deep-set eyes and bulging Adam 's apples , these skinny , bristle-headed soldiers looked like the children who begged gum along the road , and Joanna 's hands ached to touch them , ached as though hands really could have a desire separate from the rest of one 's body . The trucks rolled slowly , straining toward the crest of the hill , then , one by one , cut their engines and coasted down , perhaps to save fuel . The old woman 's face did not register anything during these five or six minutes , and even after the convoy passed , she only blinked in Joanna 's direction . The cow , however , grew restless and tossed her bony head and pulled against her neck rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken through in the west . The woman nudged Joanna with an elbow as a lone cyclist in a bright orange poncho pedaled up from the direction of Deva . The cyclist weaved back and forth in an S pattern as he approached . The green bike with the worn tires was Bogdan 's . <p> Joanna stood to greet him . " Bogdan ! What are you doing here ? " <p> " Joanna , you are disappeared , " he said , panting . He turned down the hood of the poncho , one he had borrowed from the American men . Sweat and rain had soaked his hair . " You must not be lost , " he said . " I went to this hotel in Deva , but you are not arriving . " His canvas sneakers looked waterlogged ; the thin , dark dress laces were too short , so he 'd skipped half the eyelets . <p> " I ca n't believe you came back , " Joanna said , dragging her eyes from his shoes . " Uphill . " <p> Bogdan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handlebars . Those hands would be the envy of the man back in the cafe , the envy of her husband in Chicago . Bogdan 's height and his solid ledge of shoulders would perhaps even be an affront to the Great Leader , who , despite his supposed greatness , was a pudgy and sloping man . At least vampires were irresistibly handsome as they sucked away your life force , Joanna thought . If the Great Leader wanted , he could probably throw Bogdan in jail or have him shot for his fine figure . Did Bogdan realize just how tentative his position was as a child of this regime ? Over the last few days , he 'd talked about his university and his country 's exports , but now Joanna wondered about parents and siblings , a girlfriend . How well had Bogdan known his Transylvanian grandfather ? Had the old man told him a story of rattlesnakes ? Did twenty-one-year-old communists have spare time in which to ruminate over rattlesnakes and vampires ? <p> " It is my job to take care for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay with the group . " <p> " I 'll stay with my sisters , " Joanna lied . There was no way he could make her stay with them-in order to secure rooms and arrange meals , he had to bike fast at the front . " Bogdan , " she said , " will you tell this lady you can translate ? Maybe she wants to say something to me . " <p> When Bogdan spoke to her , the old woman just swatted the air , dismissing the prospect of verbal communication as absurd . <p> " We must to go , " Bogdan said , " and to meet the others of the group . " He took off the poncho to reveal his dark checked shirt , which was too short and all wrong for biking . He 'd worn the shirt every day , and he must have washed it each night , because it always looked clean . Rather than wadding up the poncho , he folded it carefully and tucked it into his improvised front pack , a canvas shoulder-bag tied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which meant he had n't brought any food . <p> Joanna waved to the lady and her cow , and the two cyclists coasted down . For the first mile , plum trees with skulls and crossbones blurred past them , but the grade then became gentle , which meant Joanna and Bogdan had to brake only occasionally . Steam rose off the road as the rain evaporated , and Joanna heard a fiddle start , stop , and start again . <p> " I 'm fine , you know , " said Joanna . " You do n't have to worry . " <p> " Yes , I must to worry . These peoples of this region are half  --  of  --  gypsies . " <p> Joanna wanted to know about the convoy , but did n't dare ask outright . " Will you have to go into the army after college ? " <p> He smoothed his canvas bag against his handlebars . " All Romanian mens must to go in this army . " <p> Further conversation was aborted when two boys ran in front of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop , " said Bogdan , even as they were both slowing . " Deva is seven kilometers . " <p> " You want to deny these kids gum ? " <p> Bogdan braked precisely beside her , reached over and held her handlebar steady as she dug for gum in her saddlebags . The boys each accepted two pieces of Bazooka but continued clutching her front wheel , yelling to someone in the distance . From behind the house dashed a pair of young women , one in a white blouse and skirt , her hair wrapped in a white sash , her belly swollen in what was probably the sixth month of pregnancy . She grabbed Joanna 's wrist and started pulling her toward the house . Joanna resisted , trying not to fall forward over her bicycle . <p> " What do they want ? " <p> Bogdan inquired in Romanian , and the girl in white blabbed anxiously , gesturing with one hand , still tugging at Joanna 's wrist with the other . " She invites us to this party for her wedding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She says is good luck to have foreign peoples at this party . You wo n't believe , " he continued , " but she is thinking I am foreign man . " Bogdan probably did look foreign , a strong young fellow on a Czechoslovakian racing bike , wearing shorts with pockets . " But , Joanna , we must to meet the group in Deva . " <p> " The group is fine . " Joanna did n't want Bogdan to leave her , but she suggested he go ahead , she 'd catch up . Surely a wedding party would have food . <p> " You think nothing bad can happen in Romania ? " Bogdan said . " This is not America . " <p> Well , it certainly was n't Chicago . Behind and above them lay the ridge they 'd crossed . Steaming dark-green forest clung to the side of the mountain , and thick gray clouds swirled above , carried by a wind that did n't reach down this far . Maybe the pregnant bride , mist rising around her feet , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joanna had her little gold cross to protect her . Having a foreigner in one 's home was illegal , Clarice had said , but this was a wedding , and surely such rules were n't enforced . Joanna thought of her husband slumped sideways in his chair , parked in the middle of their living room awaiting her return . " I 'm going in , " she said . " How about you ? " <p> Bogdan sighed and swung a leg off his bike . <p> " Do n't worry so much , " she said , closing the door to the room in which David sat , and with that imagined action she felt a surge of heartache so forceful she had to look down , at the wet grass , at Bogdan 's shoes , at the bride 's bare feet . <p> Bogdan placed his hand on her handlebar again . " Joanna ? " <p> The house before them was built of mismatched planks and plywood stuck tightly together like puzzle pieces beneath a corrugated tin roof . The girls led them around back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a grape arbor covered with a broad sheet of grayish plastic . Here and there water leaked through , though it had stopped raining . <p> " Do you have something for giving them ? " asked Bogdan . <p> " I have gum and perfume samples . " <p> " Cigarettes or dollars is better , I think . " <p> They leaned their bikes against the side of the house . Grape leaves , bunches of pea-size grapes , and colored ribbons hung from the arbor beneath which forty or so people stood or sat on chunks of unsplit firewood . The older women wore scarves patterned like Oriental rugs , while many of the men wore ragged fedoras . As the cyclists entered , a violinist and a singer took up playing . The violinist 's shirt was unbuttoned to reveal a crop of chest hair tinged with gray . The skinny singer rattled her tambourine . <p> A boy in a straw hat brought Bogdan and Joanna each a jar of brownish wine that tasted sweet and strong-wine from plums , Bogdan said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? " <p> " You must not to eat fruits with these paintings . " <p> Before Joanna could ask why , a shrunken woman , the mother of the bride , perhaps the grandmother , called the group to attention and spoke in a nasal singsong . Then a man spoke , his arm resting on the groom 's shoulder . The groom wore a gray suit of the same bell-bottom , wide-lapel cut as every other suit Joanna had seen here , but this one looked almost new . Only one of the groom 's eyes moved-the other was tiny and motionless in its socket . The party were instructed to drink their wine , and Joanna swallowed , though it sent poisonous shivers along her limbs . Unlabeled bottles of the cloudy stuff were passed around for refills , and then everybody was looking at Joanna . Bogdan suggested she toast them , wish them luck maybe , so she held up her wine and shouted , " May you make love ! " <p> Everybody shouted and drank , except Bogdan , who looked startled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried again . " I mean , may you have lovely children ! " <p> When Bogdan translated , the crowd shouted and drank again . Joanna happened to be standing near the violinist , who put down his instrument , took her face in his hands , and kissed her mouth as though they had once been lovers . His two front teeth were gold , but his breath smelled like rotting meat . Joanna pulled away , moved to the other side of Bogdan , and took a slug of wine to wash away the taste . <p> Several people joined hands and pulled Joanna into their circle . There was a wildness here she 'd never felt folk-dancing in the gymnasium at Ida B. Noyes Hall . Adults and children raced around , bumping hips and shoulders , some of them breaking away , bouncing in and out of the circle , ducking beneath arms . The bride and another girl jumped into the center and spun , hands locked , heads tipped back , sweat plastering hair to their foreheads . When they stopped spinning , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell away from the outer circle , exhausted . She found her wine and finished it ; before she caught her breath , the straw-hatted boy filled her jar again . Joanna noticed the boy had a daisy stuck in the brim . <p> A pretty girl , maybe seventeen , the one who had twirled with the bride , pulled Joanna aside and said , " Anti-babies ? " The rims of her eyes had been darkened a charcoal color . <p> Joanna shook her head and shrugged . <p> The girl held out both hands as if to catch medicinal waters and repeated more anxiously , " Anti-babies ? " When it became clear that Joanna was n't going to comply , the girl spat at the ground and stomped away in her cracked plastic sandals . She yelled something to a group of young men , and several of them grabbed the plastic covering the grape arbor , tore it away , and left it in a heap against the house . <p> Joanna did n't mind not understanding the people who spoke to her , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  babies " with varying degrees of urgency . She found Bogdan chatting with the wine boy , whom he introduced as the bride 's little brother . Bogdan 's English was deteriorating . " There is most beauty in village , " he said in a heavy accent . He held out an arm expansively and slurred like , " Rominadas arpen peel . " <p> " Are you drunk ? " Joanna asked . <p> " Cerpingly not . " <p> " Then tell me , what is anti-baby ' ? " <p> " Anti-baby is pills . " <p> " Why are these girls asking me for pills ? What kind of pills ? " <p> " Our Great Leader forbids pills , " said Bogdan . " In order that womens can have childrens . " <p> " But what if they do n't want to have childrens ? Children . " <p> " These womens must to be gypsies and mud-jars . " <p> " Mud-jars ? " <p> " Hungerish people . " <p> " Hungry people ? " <p> " From Hungary , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adjusted his glasses , and tried to sound authoritative . " Romanian womens today are wanting five childrens . " He spread out his big , square hand as if to prove the number five . <p> Joanna imagined giving birth in Romania , lying on a metal table , arms restrained as though she were the mistress of Frankenstein , legs spread wide . Flies would perch around her lashes like ghoulish eyeliner , drinking from her corneas , sucking up her tears before she could weep them . The ubiquitous paintings of Mr. and Mrs. Great Leader would stare down at her from the wall as she performed her duty for the state . Once released from these shackles , she would spend the rest of her life trying to feed and care for that godchild of the Ceausescus , that child who would stand in the road begging strangers for gum . When the boy became a man he would beg cigarettes and ride hungry in the backs of military trucks , risk his fingers and lungs working heavy machinery to make shoes or pesticides . Bogdan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Joanna resisted an urge to fold the hand into hers . <p> Later , she saw the bride lean into the groom , pressing him against the ramshackle house . As the two began to kiss , the groom 's hands slid along the bride 's back , dragging the loose fabric of her blouse and skirt . Joanna felt her own body grow languid , her lips swell , and she wrapped her arms loosely around herself . The groom 's hat fell off , and he did not retrieve it . When the music started again , the bride dragged the hatless groom back toward the violinist , and they began another circle dance , incorporating all those who remained standing , including Bogdan and Joanna . The female singer had left . Most of the men , including the groom 's father , were lying against chunks of wood or were passed out at the edges of the courtyard , their bodies strewn about like scraps of fat cut from a steak and flung aside . <p> Late afternoon had become night , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bright as the day had been , and the foreheads and eyes of the people in the circle shone . The groom unexpectedly grabbed Joanna and spun her , handling her shoulders and arms and hips , pulling her to him and pushing her away . Her feet moved in synchrony with his , as though he and she had danced a thousand times , as though Joanna had been the one kissing him against the house . She tried to focus on that brighter eye , but she could n't look away from the dim one , small as a baby 's , unmoving . When the music changed , the bride pushed the groom aside and locked hands with Joanna . They spun in the center until their grip broke and they flew apart . The bride stumbled over , laughing , and reached to pull Joanna up from the ground , which was still warm and still wet . With both hands , Joanna pulled the bride 's pretty face down toward her own , and the girl leaned in as if to kiss Joanna , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the wine , the groom tugged the bride away with his arms encircling her swollen middle . <p> " Joanna ! " slurred Bogdan from across the courtyard . She brushed herself off and walked to him across the packed dirt . " How you are liking Ro-mah-nia ? " he asked . He was leaning sideways against one of the arbor 's posts , so she leaned to be even with him . He said , " I will tell you my grandfather is from these places . " <p> " Well , I am loving Ro-mah-nia , " Joanna said , and when the music started again she fell against Bogdan , almost knocking them both to the ground . Bogdan 's body caught hers , and she leaned her weight on his hips . She felt the shock of something like cartilage pressing against her stomach . <p> Bogdan looked at Joanna with wonder , as though she had just produced for him a platter of prime rib , as though a black-and-white scene had suddenly gone to blood-soaked color . With the wine coursing through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him childish and naive , for he was clearly wise in his knowledge of English and Romanian , the keeper of secrets about snakes and communists . She remained pressed against him , but instead of wrapping his arms around her , he continued to look at her , astonished , and breathed the three syllables of her name , " Jo-ann-ah . " His eyes , through his glasses , were graygreen and somehow out of focus . <p> Joanna was starting to think she should not merely have dipped her hands and feet into those Romanian streams ; she should have submerged herself and lain naked on the stones while the cold currents washed over her . She had wasted those streams the way she 'd wasted all those meals in Chicago restaurants when David was healthy : half-eaten plates of scampi in garlic-clouded butter with crisp bread and dry wine . Piles of olive-oily noodles were carried back into kitchens on dishes she had not scraped . She conjured up food she 'd never ordered : rare rib-eye steaks , a filet mignon wet with juice . Bogdan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was sure , but when she opened her mouth to speak , she could n't find words in English any more than she 'd been able to yell for help in Romanian back at the cafe . Before she managed to utter a syllable , she and Bogdan were pulled apart by the bride and groom , who dragged them into another dance . This time Bogdan broke away from the circle , spun with the bride , and then picked her up as if to carry her over the threshold . The bride seemed weightless in his arms while he slowed his spinning and collapsed gently to his knees , cradling her against his chest . <p> Later Joanna watched Bogdan embrace the groom and give him the disposable razor that one of the American men had given him . Bogdan called it " Zhillette , " the first consonant unbearably soft , itself a treasure . Two times Joanna gave the bride twenty-dollar bills and watched her secret them into her stretched , grayish bra . After the second time , Joanna unhooked her own sweat-soaked bra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give it to the bride , who clutched it tightly and kissed Joanna 's cheek . <p> Finally , when all but the bride 's brother , the violinist , and a few older women in scarves had either drifted away or passed out , Bogdan said , " We must to go . " Joanna would have liked to argue , but she could see no more reason to stay . <p> " OK , Bog-dan , " she said , feeling the force of each syllable . " We 'll go to Dra-cool-ya 's castle . " She swallowed the last of her wine , the dregs at the bottom her first solid food since the breakfast mamaliga . Joanna crouched beside the bride and groom , who lay in a tangled embrace , and when they did n't awaken to say good-bye , she unbuckled her sport watch and slid it onto the bride 's wrist . Joanna was fumbling to unclasp her gold chain when Bogdan grabbed her hand and pulled her to the bicycles . As she followed him toward the road , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , which felt strong and agile . Music started up behind them , thinner and slower than before . <p> In daylight , the woods had looked fresh and lush , almost inviting . Now the densely leafed branches seemed to forbid entry , the whole forest inhaling and exhaling like some root-bound leviathan regaining its strength . Wood smoke from a cook-stove chimney swept through the air on the wake of the great creature 's breath , and smoke mingled with the smell of Joanna 's own sweat . She leaned against the skull and crossbones on a plum tree as she watched the clouds . When her gaze slipped downward , it fell upon Bogdan straddling his bike . His big shoulders and bare arms were solid in the moonlight , like one of those socialist worker statues around which weeds grew in village squares . The statue turned to Joanna and stated , as though it were some wise pronouncement , " Jo-ann-ah , sleepink hotel-um . " He began to pedal and managed to balance for about fifty feet before toppling onto the roadside . Joanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print into the dirt until the bike slipped sideways to the ground . <p> She leaned over to see whether Bogdan was still conscious , leaned closer and still closer until her lips lay on his . He was unresponsive , a collection of fused body parts into which she must now restore life , a lost grandson of Transylvania ready to be reborn . She pulled the bicycle away from him and let it fall into the ditch , unsettling a black-andwhite chicken that fluttered scrawking beneath a wooden fence and into an adjacent courtyard . <p> Joanna lay on her stomach beside Bogdan a few inches from the road , letting gravel dig into her forearms . Intermittent light shone from the half-moon , which appeared and disappeared as clouds flew across the sky . In the dim strobe of light and dark , she untucked his checkered shirt . One of the buttons was bigger than the others , the buttonhole having been carefully enlarged and resewn with coarse , dark thread . She would give him a new shirt , steal it from her brothers-in-law , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all those shirts wasting in her husband 's dresser , shirts he would never again pull onto his shriveled body . <p> As she unbuttoned Bogdan 's shirt , his smooth hairless chest rose miraculously out of that crummy fabric , rose up astonishingly from the rough gravel . Running her hand across his chest was like biking uphill , each rib a marker , and she found herself breathing hard at the effort of moving from one to the next . His shorts were made of scratchy polyester , and the material made her think of the plasticized body of Lenin the Russians kept in Moscow . As she was unzipping his shorts , a car approached without lights , whining louder and louder until it was upon them . The rush of its passing so near their heads startled Bogdan awake . He lifted himself onto his elbows and adjusted his glasses . In the distance , Joanna made out the familiar rumblings of trucks . <p> Bogdan began whispering to Joanna . He whispered long sentences in Romanian , sentences that grew louder to cover the sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werewolves , surely , about rattlesnakes , about disease and dictatorship , a story she would understand if she listened hard enough . His dead man 's arms eased to life and wrapped around her . He rolled his body over hers , over again into the drainage ditch so that she lay on her back beneath him , his bike at their feet . His glasses fell beside her head onto the warm mud , but in the shadow of his face she could n't make out his eyes at all . <p> " Tell me in English , Bogdan , " she whispered . <p> " I 'm saying to you , Jo-ann-ah , these childrens from this forest are living with wolfs . My grandfather is telling me this before he dies , and I am forgetting this story until I 'm seeing this boy . I 'm saying to you , Jo-ann-ah , this milk from these wolfs is strongest milk , so these childrens are strong , and they protect these places . You see , Jo-ann-ah , even the Great Leader fears if these childrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but inserted her name more frequently into the sentences , " Jo-ann-ah , " as if those were the sounds that could drown out the trucks . She 'd never heard her name spoken that way , the syllables separated and repeated as if to invoke a spell . <p> She tugged at their clothes until she 'd pulled them all away . Her gold chain somehow broke , and she felt it slither under her armpit . She wished for a bottle of plum wine so she could tip it to her mouth and let it slosh down her throat and onto her cheeks and neck . She hummed what she could remember of a violin tune in order not to hear the wheels on asphalt . From now on she would eat anything Bogdan put in front of her-sheep cheese , organ meats , warm raw cream . She would drink pork fat from the glass ashtray into which she 'd spooned it this morning . She would no longer kill the life in the water with iodine pills , but would drink the ah-pah as it arose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices could no longer mask it . Joanna stretched up , and her teeth clacked against Bogdan 's , smooth as hard candies , smooth as polished bones . Vehicles without headlights approached and passed like phantoms . As the convoy rolled upon them , vehicle by massive vehicle , Bogdan 's hands moved over her breasts , around her back , along her thighs . <p> His hands felt like dozens of hands , children 's hands groping for milk at her breasts , soldier-boy hands reaching between her legs , whole bodies of skin sticking to hers . Bogdan opened his lips onto her neck . The pressure of his mouth told her about the children conceived in such moments , children of drunkenness , of heat and desperation . Clarice and Margaret would not have such children . As the trucks and personnel carriers strained up the mountain past them , Joanna imagined the babies with thin muscular limbs whose hunger made them monsters , whether curled quietly inside wombs or in the dens of wolves deep in the woods near Brasov castle . The earth swelled around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogdan covered her body like the lid to a box , and she reached up and covered his ears with her hands . <p> Author Affiliation
