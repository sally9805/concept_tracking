It 's 9:30 p.m. , and Stephen and Georgina Cox know exactly where their children are . Well , their bodies , at least . Piers , 14 , is holed up in his bedroom  --  eyes fixed on his computer screen  --  where he has been logged onto a MySpace chat room and AOL Instant Messenger ( IM ) for the past three hours . His twin sister Bronte is planted in the living room , having commandeered her dad 's iMac  --  as usual . She , too , is busily IMing , while chatting on her cell phone and chipping away at homework . <P> By all standard space-time calculations , the four members of the family occupy the same three-bedroom home in Van Nuys , Calif. , but psychologically each exists in his or her own little universe . Georgina , 51 , who works for a display-cabinet maker , is tidying up the living room as Bronte works , not that her daughter notices . Stephen , 49 , who juggles jobs as a squash coach , fitness trainer , event planner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his dinner alone in the kitchen , having missed supper with the kids . He , too , typically spends the evening on his cell phone and returning e-mails  --  when he can nudge Bronte off the computer . " One gets obsessed with one 's gadgets , " he concedes . <P> Zooming in on Piers ' screen gives a pretty good indication of what 's on his hyperkinetic mind . O.K. , there 's a Google Images window open , where he 's chasing down pictures of Keira Knightley . Good ones get added to a snazzy Windows Media Player slide show that serves as his personal e-shrine to the actress . Several IM windows are also open , revealing such penetrating conversations as this one with a MySpace pal : <P> MySpacer : suuuuuup ! ! ! ( Translation : What 's up ? ) <P> Piers : wat up dude <P> MySpacer : nmu ( Not much . You ? ) <P> Piers : same <P> Naturally , iTunes is open , and Piers is blasting a mix of Queen , AC/DC , classic rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , in which Piers is writing an essay for English class . " I usually finish my homework at school , " he explains to a visitor , " but if not , I pop a book open on my lap in my room , and while the computer is loading , I 'll do a problem or write a sentence . Then , while mail is loading , I do more . I get it done a little bit at a time . " <P> Bronte has the same strategy . " You just multitask , " she explains . " My parents always tell me I ca n't do homework while listening to music , but they do n't understand that it helps me concentrate . " The twins also multitask when hanging with friends , which has its own etiquette . " When I talk to my best friend Eloy , " says Piers , " he 'll have one earpiece of his iPod in and one out . " Says Bronte : " If a friend thinks she 's not getting my full attention , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 'm also listening to music . "
