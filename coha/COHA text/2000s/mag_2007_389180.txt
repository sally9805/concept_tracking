Sidebar GOLDEN FACT * It has been estimated that , worldwide , the total amount of gold ever mined is 152,000 metric tons , only enough to fill 60 tractor trailers . In comparison , each year , 907,000,000 metric tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,000 times the total gold produced throughout history . * More than 90% of all gold ever used has been mined since 1848 , when it was discovered at Sutler 's Mill , Calif. , sparking the greatest gold rush of all time . * Gold nuggets are solid lumps of gold . They make up less than two percent of all native gold ever mined. * Only five out of 1,000,000,000 atoms of rock in Earth 's crust are gold . * Oceans are the greatest single reservoir of gold at Earth 's surface , containing approximately eight times the total quantity mined to date . However , the current cost of extracting it is more than the gold is worth . * Gold is so malleable that a single ounce-which is about the size of a quarter-can be beaten into a thin continuous sheet measuring roughly 100 square feet . That means it would take just 36 pounds of gold to cover a football field completely , or about 11 tons to blanket all of Central Park . * One ounce of gold can be stretched into a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter ) thick that would reach in a straight line from midtown Manhattan across the Long Island Sound to Bridgeport , Conn. -a distance of 50 miles . * Nearly 40% of all gold ever mined was recovered from South African rocks . * Gold leaf may be only 0.18 microns ( seven millionths of an inch ) thick ; a stack of 7,055 sheets would be no thicker than a dime. * The visors of astronauts ' space helmets receive a coating of gold so thin ( 0.000002 inches ) that it is partially transparent . The astronauts can see through it , but even this thin layer reduces glare and heat from sunlight . * Most gold-78% of the yearly supply-is made into jewelry . Other industries-electronics , medical , and dental-require about 12% . The remaining 10% is used in financial transactions . * The oldest worked-gold objects , the products of the ancient Thracian civilization , were made as early as 4000 B.C. and were discovered at a burial site in Varna , Bulgaria . * In the Aztec language , the name for gold is teocuit/at/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the Incas and other peoples of the Andean region of South America , gold was the " sweat of the sun , " the most sacred of all deities . * The original story of El Dorado- " the gilded one " - describes a ritual in which the chief of the Andean Muisca nation , covered in gold dust , made offerings of gold into a mountain lake . Spanish conquistadores of the 1530s were gripped by the story ; eventually , it turned into the legend of a lost city of gold . * Virtually all of the Incas ' golden treasure was melted down , first in a vain attempt to ransom their captured king . Then , after his execution , more gold was commandeered to fill the coffers of the Spanish treasury . * The " Welcome Stranger , " the largest gold nugget ever recorded , was found in Victoria , Australia , in 1869 , weighing about 172 pounds . When it was melted down , it produced 156 pounds of pure gold . * The largest gold nugget believed to exist today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also discovered in Victoria in October 1980 . It currently is on display at the Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas . * India is the world 's largest consumer of gold . South Asian jewelry generally is of higher purity than Western jewelry-22 karats , compared to 14. * The Federal Reserve Bank of New York holds the world 's largest accumulation of monetary gold . The vault is 80 feet beneath the street and contains $147,000,000,000 worth of gold bullion . The bedrock of Manhattan is strong enough to support the weight of the vault , its door , and the gold inside . <p>
