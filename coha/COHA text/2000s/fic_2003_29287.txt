We always had our differences , my sister and I , but I never meant to hurt her . I surely never wished her dead . Though sometimes , late at night , when I 'm sitting here by her bedside , I wonder . Because in my twenty years of living , I believe I 've received more than one omen of where love , hate , and rivalry has finally taken us , now that we 're both grown women . For instance , that one fall day in 1906 , when Rebecca was three and I was seven . Dad had roused us early , in the yellow-gray light before dawn . He 'd clumsily bundled us up as we yawned and complained , stuffed cold biscuits in our hands , and put us aboard his work boat , an old bar cat with a green sail . " Your mam 's sickly today , " he told us . " Needs her rest . So you squits 'll have to come along with me , God help us . " I 'd never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the Lord 's name in vain , but I was too thrilled to be shocked . " Oh , yes , " I shouted . " Yes , please , Dad . " Rebecca only squealed and hopped around . I was sure she was too young to grasp the rare privilege of finally being allowed what I 'd thought then all little girls dreamed of : to ride along on Dad 's work , to sit in the stern wearing a cap like a real waterman . But we had n't gotten far , only to the channel between our island and the next , when I turned to see my sister 's red coat , her wool leggings , her patent shoes disappearing over the side . She dropped without a sound . The vanishing clothes were so unexpected a sight , a bewitched moment passed before I recalled Rebecca was inside them . And that she could n't swim a lick . I looked quick to my father , to see what he 'd do about it . He was fiddling with the sail , his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another moment I could n't speak ; could n't even recall Rebecca 's name or my own . All I could think to do was scream . Dad dropped his line and turned to look . " What , Annie ? " he said . Sharp-edged worry creased his forehead . " Becca , " was all I could get out . So I pointed over the water behind us . Back in our wake a flailing arm , a last billow of bright red material . That was all . He came about sharp , and in a moment we were at the spot where she 'd vanished . He rushed to one side of the boat then the other , looking down . I leaned over the stern , and saw her there below . About a foot down , her face turned up to the sky , eyes open . She hung suspended in the water , trailing a string of bubbles like oversized pearls , hair a dark cloud around her face , as graceful as one of the water sprites in my fairy book . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To me it looked as if Rebecca were rising to the surface . Coming to me , not falling away . A mermaid about to be born . My father shoved me out of the way , pushed the tiller over to head us into the wind , and jumped in . He came up with my sister clutched in one arm and hauled himself into the boat with the other . Laid her on the thwarts and turned her head , and did things to help her cough up water . At last he sat her up and wrapped her shivering body in his oilskin jacket . Then he spanked me . I understood why . It would have done no good to say I had n't seen it happen ; that the first I 'd known of it was the sight of her legs disappearing suddenly over the side , any more than it would have helped to lie and claim I had n't seen a thing . At seven , with Mam sick all the time , I had long since understood that my sister was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dad generally had a lighter hand than Mam . Then he made me sit beside my sister . " You 're not to let go of her , maid . Not ever . She 's not got the sense to look after herself yet . " I would n't look at him , but I nodded . " You swear it , now ? " " Yes , Dad . " He seemed satisfied then , and went back to the tiller . Rebecca leaned into me and stopped sobbing long enough to glance up , her dark lashes clumped and spiky with tears and saltwater . " All wet , Annie , " she said , plucking at her sodden clothes . She shivered again . I waited until my father turned away to hoist the sail before I risked giving her a light pinch . I frowned down at her , then made a big point of looking away . Dad came about directly and headed home again . He squinted into the risen sun and muttered something like , " Mend blasted nets on such a God-given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I felt hers curl like a small , cold starfish around mine , I relented and hugged her tight against me , astonished at how easily she 'd almost been lost . But I still felt aggrieved . Her weight seemed to settle on my shoulders like dropped anchor chain . How long would it be before she had any good sense ? It seemed hard that , until that day , I was supposed to look out for her . Some of these winter nights now , after I 've cleared the table and put away the dishes , I sit by Rebecca 's bed . I sip hot tea with a little of the shine whiskey our friend Sam Doughty brings , and listen to be sure my sister 's breathing is easy . If she 's awake , I talk of the things we 'll do when she 's well . I remind her of the mischief and pleasure we found as kids , like that time I once cut all my hair off to try to be a boy . Or the way she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reading , to get me to come out and play . And though it 's the one story I never tell , I wonder if she ever remembers as far back as that accident in the old bar cat  --  the first time she nearly drowned . Or what she recalls of the night six months ago , when we fled this island and tried to outrun a storm in a motor launch . Worse than the great nor'easter of 1897 , is what I hear folks are claiming now . That one was three years before my birth , so I could n't say . This last storm tried its damnedest to flatten our little islands , though , and the rest of the Virginia coast . No doubt they 'll soon be calling it the great nor'easter of 1920 , and make their children and grandchildren yawn with repeated tellings . From the water it 's easy to see the damage . But you have to walk away from the house here on Yaupon , over the dunes to the seaside , to find the sandy plot we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many more crosses there now than three months ago . We have n't put a marker out for Nathan . Not yet . Some days , though , I have gotten as far as planning one . It 'll be wood , like the others . But I picture his differently . Carved with a seabird , or maybe a curved , leaping fish . That would make Reverend Scarborough happy ; he need n't know it 's not the sign of Christ . But it 's all Rebecca 's decision , when she 's feeling better . This time I wo n't insist on having things my own way . I understand now what it costs a body to be set on getting what you want , no matter what . Our little island is only about a mile across . It seemed wide when I was a child , and the only place that could ever be home . We did n't know much of anywhere else then . Even now , being twenty and fully grown , I do n't feel the need to , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that bought up the fish and crabs and oysters my father pulled from the water . He explained to me once that they sold them again to people in New York and New Jersey . And yet , he said , folks there sometimes went hungry and begged on the streets . It had to do with banks and markets , and sometimes business was poor . Those lean times we ate more of the fish and crabs ourselves , but even a lazy man would be hard put to go hungry on the Eastern Shore . We still have no electricity , but ducks and muskrats and other game crowd the woods and shore . You can grow anything green most of the year , and there 's always the water , full of crab and shrimp and mananose clams . All that city business seemed far away to us then . It still does now . I 'm the sister who was never much to look at , even as a baby , when most are at least passably cute . But until I went to school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , and Granny Jester and my little sister Becca . So I was a happy child with a coming appetite , and gave no thought to good looks or what they might mean to a girl in this world . I did n't know any better than to stay happy for a long time . Did n't know there might be more than what all we had . And then , when I finally discovered something to hunger after , it had n't a thing to do with banks or cities or even electric-powered gadgets . Some days I believe it was my selfishness and greed that brought calamity down on us , just like Mam and Granny Jester said I would . Other days , I know it was only bad judgment and bad weather . I do n't have much to fear losing now , but I intend to hang on . What 's left is all the more precious to me . I intend to spend the rest of my natural life free of envy and spite and the bother of love , or what passes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish as any human could make , I guess . But I aim to give it a go , nonetheless . I told Rebecca that just the other day , and it got a smile out of her . She knows me well enough not to be impressed .
