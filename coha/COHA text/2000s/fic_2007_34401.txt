Why I feel the sudden urge to relate , in pen and ink , a relationship of the most personal nature , which I have never before acknowledged , I can not say . Perhaps it is this maddening illness which has been troubling me now and again of late-this cunning reminder of my own mortality-that compels me to make some record of what happened , to prevent that memory from vanishing into the recesses of my mind , and from there to disappear for ever from history , as fleeting as a ghost in the mist . Whatever the reason , I find that I must write it all down ; for there may , I think , be speculation when I am gone . People may read what I have written , and wonder : how could this spinster , this woman who , to all appearances , never even courted-who never felt that wondrous connection of mind and spirit between a man and woman , which , inspired by friendship and affection , blooms into something deeper-how could she have had the temerity to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never experienced them herself ? To those few friends and relations who , upon learning of my authorship , have dared to pose a similar question ( although , I must admit , in a rather more genteel turn ofphrase ) , I have given the self-same reply : " Is it not conceivable that an active mind and an observant eye and ear , combined with a vivid imagination , might produce a literary work of some merit and amusement , which may , in turn , evoke sentiments and feelings which resemble life itself ? " There is much truth in this observation . But there are many levels of veracity , are there not , between that truth which we reveal publicly and that which we silently acknowledge , in the privacy of our own thoughts , and perhaps to one or two of our most intimate acquaintances ? I did attempt to write of love-first , in jest , as a girl ; then in a more serious vein , in my early twenties , though I had known only young love then ; 1 in consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only years later that I met the man who would come to inspire the true depth of that emotion , and who would reawaken my voice , which had long lain dormant . Of this gentleman-the one , true , great love in my life-I have , for good reason , vowed never to speak ; indeed , it was agreed amongst the few close members of my family who knew him , that it was best for all concerned to keep the facts of that affair strictly to ourselves . In consequence , I have relegated my thoughts of him to the farthest reaches of my heart ; banished for ever-but not forgotten . No , never forgotten . For how can one forget that which has become a part of one 's very soul ? Every word , every thought , every look and feeling that passed between us , is as fresh in my mind now , years later , as if it had occurred only yesterday . The tale must be told ; a tale which will explain all the others . But I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , universally acknowledged ) that , with few exceptions , the introduction of the hero in a love-story should never take place in the first chapter , but should , ideally , be deferred to the third ; that a brief foundation should initially be laid , acquainting the reader with the principal persons , places , circumstances and emotional content of the story , so as to allow a greater appreciation for the proceedings as they unfold . Therefore , before we meet the gentleman in question , I must go further back to relate two events which occurred some years earlier-both of which altered my life , suddenly and irrevocably , in a most dreadful and painful way . In December 1800 , shortly before the twenty-fifth anniversary of my birth , I had been away , visiting my dear friend Martha Lloyd . Upon returning home , my mother startled me by announcing , " Well , Jane , it is all settled ! We have decided to leave Steventon behind us for good , and go to Bath . " " Leave Steventon ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it . " " Oh , but I do , " said my mother as she bustled happily about the small parlour , pausing to study the pictures on the wall with a look of fond farewell , as if making peace with the thought of leaving them all behind . " Your father and I talked it over while you were gone . He will be seventy in May . It is high time he retired , after nearly forty years as the rector of this parish , not to mention Deane . 2 Giving up the post , you know , means giving up the house , but your brother James will benefit by it , as it will go to him ; and as your father has always longed to travel , we thought , what better time than the present ? Let us go , while we still have our health ! But where we should go , that was a matter of great debate , and we have at last come to conclusion that it should be Bath ! " My head began to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily into the nearest chair , wishing that my beloved sister was there to share the burden of this distressing news . Cassandra , who is three years older than I , and far more beautiful , is possessed of a calm and gentle disposition ; I can always depend on her to rally my spirits in even the worst of situations . But she was away at the time , visiting our brother Edward and his family in Kent . " Jane ! " I heard my mother cry . " Why , I believe the poor girl has fainted . Mr. Austen ! Do come help ! Where are the smelling-salts ? " I had been born at Steventon , and had passed all the happy days of my life there . I could no more imagine leaving that beloved place than I could sprout wings and fly . I loved the trellised front porch of the parsonage house , the perfectly balanced arrangement of sash windows in its flat front faade , and the unadorned , white-washed walls and open-beam ceilings within . I had grown to cherish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , and every plant and shrub in the back garden , where I strolled almost daily along the turf walk , bordered by strawberry beds.
