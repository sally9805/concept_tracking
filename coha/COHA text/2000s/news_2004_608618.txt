It is the dominant maker of fighter aircraft , but its portfolio ranges from work launching satellites to processing millions of Social Security checks . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Lockheed remained the industry 's leading player with $32 billion in revenue last year . The big news was the announcement Vance Coffman plans to retire as chief executive in August after 37 years with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , will replace Coffman . <p> The shift is not expected to bring any significant change in Lockheed 's strategy , which last year focused on expanding its information technology business and adapting adroitly to the Pentagon 's evolving ideas about high-tech warfare . <p> Lockheed created a new unit , Integrated Systems and Solutions , which looks across the company 's businesses for opportunities to cooperate and merge expertise and is supposed to make the company more nimble . When pursuing a contract , for example , the unit can pull together an aeronautics engineer in one unit with a software technician in another . <p> Meanwhile , two of Lockheed 's largest programs remained under a spotlight . The Joint Strike Fighter , expected to be the largest weapons program in Pentagon history , will cost $40 billion to develop , about $7 billion more than originally expected . Critics also continue to question whether the Air Force needs the F/A-22 Raptor , a stealth fighter jet , which was conceived during the Cold War . The Raptor is scheduled to enter service in 2005 . <p> 3190 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 703-876-3000 <p> www.generaldynamics.com <p> Founded : 1952 <p> Revenue : $16.62 billion <p> Net income : $1 billion <p> Earnings per share : $5.04 <p> Dividend : $1.28 <p> Stockholder equity : $5.92 billion <p> Auditor : KPMG LLP <p> Stock : GD ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $16.18 billion <p> Market capitalization : $18.36 billion <p> 52-week high : $97.00 ( 2/9/2004 ) <p> 52-week low : $53.83 ( 4/14/2003 ) <p> Chairman and CEO : Nicholas D.

The information technology business , which includes providing network security to the Pentagon , was boosted by the $1.5 billion purchase of Veridian . Revenue in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Combat Systems , which reported rising demand for ammunition and bombs , was helped by the $1.1 billion acquisition of General Motors Defense , a unit of General Motors Corp . Last year also marked the first deployment of General Dynamics ' Stryker , a medium-weight armored vehicle that transports troops around the battlefield . That unit reported a 42.5 percent increase in revenue to $4.1 billion . <p> The unit is expected to receive another boost from General Dynamics ' March announcement that it intended to buy London-based armored-vehicle maker Alvis PLC for $556 million . The deal , if approved by shareholders and regulators , is expected to lift General Dynamics into a leading position in the European tanks and armored vehicles market . <p> On the downside , the economic downturn continued to bedevil the company 's aircraft business . Gulfstream reported a 51 percent drop in operating earnings to $218 million in 2003 . <p> In shipbuilding , General Dynamics celebrated an $8 billion submarine deal , but the unit 's results continued to be hampered by commercial contracts to build oil tankers . Profits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Dynamics also helped establish national precedent last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal anti-age-discrimination law permits company benefit plans to favor older workers over younger ones . The lawsuit originated in General Dynamics ' decision to change its health plan for retirees in 1997 , saying it could afford to offer the future benefit only to workers older than 50 . <p> 1525 Wilson Blvd. , Suite 700 <p> Arlington , Va . 22209 <p> 703-312-6100 <p> www.uniteddefense.com <p> Founded : 1994 <p> Revenue : $2.05 billion <p> Net income : $140.65 million <p> Earnings per share : $2.66 <p> Dividend : None <p> Stockholder equity : $127.08 million <p> Auditor : Ernst &; Young LLP <p> Stock : UDI ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $1.59 billion <p> Market capitalization : $1.75 billion <p> 52-week high : $34.31 ( 1/23/2004 ) <p> 52-week low : $21.46 ( 4/14/2003 ) <p> President and CEO : Thomas W.

Last year United Defense 's ship repair work for the United States accounted for about a third of the company 's $2 billion revenue . The ship-repair unit is the largest non-nuclear ship-repair company in the country with shipyards in Norfolk , San Diego and Pearl Harbor . <p> The company 's biggest customers are the Army and Navy .

It has bought six companies in the past 12 months . <p> In March it announced its latest , Fairfax-based American Management Systems , for $415 million . CACI is buying AMS 's Defense Intelligence Group from CGI Group Inc. , a Canadian information technology company that bought AMS and is keeping its non-defense units . <p> CACI also acquired C-CUBED , which provides communications , intelligence and computer support to the Defense Department ; Primier Technology Group , which provides intelligence analysis and security services to the Defense Department ; Applied Technology Solutions , which supplies management and information technology and training to clients in national intelligence communities ; MTL Systems Inc. , which provides engineering services and integration services such as imagery technology , algorithm development and modeling and simulation for defense ; Rochester Information Systems , which develops information systems in health , education and local governments within the United Kingdom ; and CMS Information Services , which develops network solutions and financial management systems in the national defense sector . <p> CACI Chairman J.P .

That is in addition to the two companies it bought in 2002 , when it went public . <p> Among the acquisitions last year was MSM Security Services , a Greenbelt firm that specializes in background checks on applicants for federal security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for the Defense Security Service . MSM broadened its reach to the Customs Service and the National Security Agency . <p> But the acquisition also added some volatility to ManTech 's financial results . Wall Street got concerned when the company announced that the average number of days to collect payments rose to 94 in the fourth quarter , up from 86 days in the third quarter . <p> Collection times rose because background checks typically take four to five months and the government does not pay until they are complete , company officials said . <p> 21839 Atlantic Blvd . <p> Dulles , Va . 20166 <p> 703-406-5000 <p> www.orbital.com <p> Founded : 1982 <p> Revenue : $581.50 million <p> Net income : $20.24 million <p> Earnings per share : 35 cents <p> Dividend : None <p> Stockholder equity : $166.88 million <p> Auditor : PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP <p> Stock : ORB ( NYSE ) <p> Assets : $439.30 million <p> Market capitalization : $591.77 million <p> 52-week high : $14.00 ( 2/12/2004 ) <p> 52-week low : $5.08 ( 5/20/2003 ) <p> Chairman and CEO : David W.

The Defense Department and intelligence agencies make up about half its customers . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration accounts for another quarter of its business , and the rest is from private-sector companies such as international satellite operators . <p> DEVELOPMENTS : Orbital Sciences got a boost late last year when it won a contract valued at up to $400 million to develop a kinetic energy interceptor , a missile-defense system designed to shoot down enemy missiles in the first few minutes of flight . Working with Raytheon and Northrop Grumman , Orbital will engineer the initial design . <p> The company won 70 percent of the contracts it bid on last year , bringing in nearly $1.4 billion in new business . Much of the growth came from launch vehicles and missile defense . <p> The growth was tempered by the company 's communications satellite businesses and transportation management systems  --  software and wireless communication products sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail . Revenue in the transportation business fell by 44 percent last year , and the company is trying to figure out how to improve performance . <p> But Orbital 's overall revenue still increased last year , to $582 million from $552 million .

Brehm had 16.7 percent , a figure that has now dropped to 15.8 percent . <p> SRA continued to take part in an industry-wide consolidation of small and mid-size defense-related information technology companies last year , buying Orion Scientific Systems for $34.5 million .

The real action last year was in Belgium , where the company 's MECAR subsidiary racked up contract after contract to sell artillery , antitank rounds and anti-personnel munitions to customers in the Middle East , Europe and South America . <p> But MECAR also took an important step into the U.S. market , winning a $28 million contract in April to provide 105mm " Bunker Busters " for the Army 's new Stryker Brigades .
