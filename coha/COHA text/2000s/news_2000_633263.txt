<p> If your reporters had bothered to inform themselves , they would have understood the context of my " PMS " remark  --  and they would have avoided the disservice to your readers in articles criticizing me for that reference . <p> As Chief Appellate Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out , in his outline of the " avalanche of errors " in my trial , I was wrongfully denied medical testimony in my defense . <p> In the words of the opinion ( available to your reporters on your own Web site ) , " The central item of evidence . . . was a tape recording of a phone conversation . . . . The prosecutor asked the jury in opening argument to ' notice her tone and demeanor , ' in order to help the jury to interpret her words as extortionate ; and in closing argument he told the jury that Santos had chosen the ' tone ' she had used in making the allegedly extortionate demands . . . . Anticipating that the prosecution would make an issue of Santos ' tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial began to permit him to call a doctor to testify that Santos ' thyroid condition may have affected her tone of voice . The district judge had refused to permit this . . . . The judge should have allowed Santos to present limited medical evidence to help the jury interpret her tone . " <p> The effect of a thyroid condition like mine , which creates severe hormonal imbalances , has been likened to " super PMS , " and that is how I have chosen to describe it . My references to PMS might seem flippant , or worse , to a reader who sees them out of context . But to anyone following this case responsibly , they are to the point . <p> This side issue , to which you devoted a full page and a half , is off the mark . While it generated a storm of misinformed replies from a number of women , including a few of whom I know and respect , it misses the legal issues at stake  --  and confuses pre-menstrual syndrome with the toxic effects of a thyroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be learned <p> Illinois schoolchildren have been making meaningful strides in their learning . That is something the entire state can take pride in , but we must continue to move forward . My goal as chairman of the State Board of Education is to ensure that all Illinois schools are provided the tools they need to deliver the highest quality of education possible . <p> We are preparing students to meet the Illinois Learning Standards . This gives them their best chance for success . While the standards provide a clear picture of what knowledge and skills our students are expected to learn , the Illinois Standards Achievement Test gives us an excellent measure by which to gauge students ' success . Students across Illinois now are taking the 2000 ISAT to show how well they are progressing toward meeting those standards . <p> The men and women who make up the State Board of Education and its administrative agency go to work every day for the future of Illinois ' children . That 's why we will continue to improve on what we do at the board just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald J. Gidwitz , chairman , <p> Illinois State Board of <p> Education , Springfield <p> Safety before savings <p> As Illinois physicians who practice anesthesiology , we commend Jim Ritter and the Chicago Sun-Times for their thorough reporting ( Jan. 25 ) about the tremendous advances made in the safety of anesthesiology . Over the last 30 years , as pointed out in the article , anesthesiologists wrote the book about anesthesia patient safety  --  spearheading the programs that investigated complications and deaths and then creating standards to ensure the highest levels of safety . Today , more than 90 percent of all hospital and outpatient surgery center anesthetics are administered or supervised by anesthesiologists . <p> In one area , however , we are seeing a reversal of these patient-safety accomplishments : office surgery facilities . While anesthesia-related deaths in hospitals and outpatient surgery centers are estimated at 1 in 250,000 to 300,000 , the death rate from surgery in office surgery facilities could be as high as 1 in 5,000 . <p> The problem is that most office surgery facilities are not required to adhere to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opponents say regulations will only add to the cost of surgery at these facilities . <p> Additional costs , if any , pale in comparison to the value of preventing deaths or serious injuries related to anesthesia for office-based procedures . <p> Jeffrey L.

Tuman , M.D. <p> Illinois Society of <p> Anesthesiologists <p> Pay ; pay some more <p> In the wake of our recent report on skyrocketing ATM fees , we commend Rep. John Fritchey ( D-Chicago ) for his efforts to resurrect his bill to ban ATM surcharges in Illinois . Last year , the so-called Consumer Protection Committee of the Illinois House voted the measure down after intense lobbying efforts by banking interests . <p> What has that brought Illinois consumers ? Both ATM surcharges and out-of-network fees have continued to climb since February 1999 and have become more widespread . It is nearly impossible for ATM users to avoid a double whammy of $ 3 or more at machines that do n't belong to the bank . <p> It 's no wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a surcharge ban . This year , we hope legislators who succumbed to the banking lobby will stand by their constituents . Illinois citizens should contact their representatives and watch to see if they side with consumers by backing House Bill 527 . <p> Nancy A. Cowles , <p> executive director , <p> Coalition for Consumer Rights <p> Pleasure in pedagogy <p> Your feature story about the Sherwood Music School ( " Notable century , " Feb. 2 ) brought back fond memories of clarinet lessons during my high school band-member days . There also was a Sherwood Symphony , and being a part of the woodwind section introduced me to the world of orchestral music . <p> From the standpoint of music education , though , Sherwood stands out because of its Sherwood Piano Course , which was a multiyear , comprehensive correspondence course in music theory and piano performance . There were graded lessons and musical exercises as well as compositions of appropriate difficulty ; while weekly tests were checked and corrected by the supervising local piano teacher , major examinations were sent to Chicago for grading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new piece of music from an extensive list . <p> For piano teachers in small towns or isolated rural areas with no easy access to a music store , the Sherwood course was a godsend . In addition to the wide range of repertoire , it provided a thorough background in keyboard technique and music theory , and offered little rewards along the way  --  a pennant , pin , ring , pen , all with the distinctive blue-and-gold Sherwood logo  --  and , finally , a diploma . <p> In this era of instant international access to ever-expanding technological advances , it is easy to dismiss the significance of a mail-order music course . In its day , however , I am certain that those big brown envelopes , full of new music and successful test results , were as eagerly anticipated as today 's e-mail . For that alone , Sherwood Music School deserves a special place in Chicago history . <p> Rosagitta Podrovsky , <p> West Ridge <p> Still a vast wasteland <p> Let us hope that drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey is better at running his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says , " There can be no suggestion of federal interference in the creative process . " Then , in the next sentence he says that now they will ask for program content to be submitted " only after they have been telecast . " <p> Then he goes on to characterize Congress as wise because members have allowed McCaffrey 's office to create anti-drug messages in TV programming . A couple of things here : Messages in the programming are in fact interference in the program , and just because you are allowed to do something ( as the wise Congress has allowed him ) does n't mean it is a mandate . A mandate means that the wise Congress has insisted with the force of law that something be done . <p> Lawrence M. Milott , <p> North Center <p> Course of a lifetime <p> Concerning your editorial ( Jan. 31 ) on Leon and Amy Kass ' course at the University of Chicago on love and marriage : That topic is no less worthy of scholarly attention , either in research or teaching , than the topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a university 's mission to explore all the aspects of the world in which we live . <p> Everything I know about the course comes from the news story ( Jan. 27 ) , which seemed to imply that it was mostly a paean to marriage . But even slanted in that manner , it deserves a chance in the marketplace of ideas . That is what academic freedom is all about . <p> Mitchell A.
