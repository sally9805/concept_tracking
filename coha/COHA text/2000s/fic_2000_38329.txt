" The Iron Wood " marks a bit of a departure , just in the sense that it 's a rare fantasy for him that is n't set in a real , historical setting . The medieval world of Markovy with its unusual forests is every bit as enthralling as past tales from this writer 's pen ( if not more so ) . Let 's hope we 'll get to see more of it in the future . <p> THIS WILL BE CAPITAL FUN , " the grinning idiot in armor declared , gesturing at the mob blocking the rutted roadway . D'Cey doubted that . Doubted it a lot . Keeping a gloved hand on his sword hilt , he twisted in the saddle , seeing nothing funny about frightened serfs in sackcloth tunics waving farm tools as if they were weapons . He saw axes , flails , and hayforks - but no proper pikes or halberds , thank God . It was a flogging offense for a serf to own so much as a boar spear . Death to be caught with a sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his hearty endorsement . Luckily , he had a dozen crossbowmen at his back , hired felons eager to kill their countrymen for a few coppers a day . " What has them so scared ? " D'Cey hated not speaking the language . He knew French , Greek , and enough Latin to talk to God , as well as his native Langue d'Oc - but only a smattering of Markovite . Which made him dependent on the supercilious young boyar beside him-Baron Alexi D'Medved , six feet of boastful swagger in a satin surcoat and mail shirt , his head as empty as his helmet . Chevalier Reynard D'Cey was some inches shorter , with a cultured outlook , and dreamy pensive features now shading into alarm . Distrusting his cocksure companion , he dearly wished for some sure means of communicating with the crowd . Alexi smirked at the terrified serfs . " They say it 's a devil-cat . " D'Cey arched an eyebrow . French was the language of chivalry , but not every chevalier could speak it . Alexis astonishing accent made English sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured him . " An excuse to lock themselves in their hovels , sending out wives for wood and water . Or to parade about demanding protection , neglecting crops and labor services . " Scanning the terror-stricken faces , D'Cey did not think the commotion would just go away . " So there is no man-eating cat ? " Alexi shrugged . " Now and again a leopard out of the Iron Wood eats someone 's cow or child . But a demon cat ? Hardly ! " He rose in his stirrups , lifting a gloved hand and shouting to the crowd in atrocious French , " You are all craven witless idiots - are you not ? " He got back a roar of hopeful approval . " Useless , ignorant , lice-eating brutes - the whole thieving lot of you . " More cheers . Alexi settled back in his seat , grinning with delight . " Only regular beatings keep them honest and alert . " That morning the young boyar had flogged a groom half to death for burning the meat , breaking a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as D'Cey could see , this impromptu whipping improved neither the tone nor content of the meal - which were indifferent at best - overdone beef , beet roots , and a vile wine could barely be styled breakfast . Being in exile , D'Cey happily imposed on serf hospitality , finding the typical Markovite tolerably clean and slavish to a fault - offering the bread on his table , the cloak off his back , and the wife in his bed . " Whatever your lordship requires . " Warm snug hovels had painted birds and carved troll faces guarding the door , and pots of pig-bran bubbling on the hearth . Despite a superstitious horror of musical instruments , young and old sang in drunken harmony round the dung fire . Baron Alexi lived in a lord 's paradise , but was too fool to see it . Men were worshipfully obedient . Women buxom and agreeable . Until now , D'Cey had not known they could become dangerously excited . Alexi spurred his mount and they headed off , the crowd treading anxiously at the crossbowmen 's heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahead the immense plains of Markovy met the black line of the Iron Wood . D'Cey rode past ill-tilled fields and a glum mud and log hamlet . Women lifted leather door curtains . Angelic children peeped from behind bright embroidered skirts , eyes wide watching them pass Despite the young boyar 's sangfroid , D'Cey saw sure signs of a mankiller on the loose . Fields untended . Fruit rotting on the trees . No travelers on the road . Farm animals taken inside . Women not working , children not playing . No cook fires because no one dared gather wood . Ahead stood their day 's destination , a tall Byzantine keep - Kara Zamak - the stronghold of a local family Alexi meant to call on and intimidate . They had an heiress ripe for marriage that the D'Medveds wanted . Already Alexi acted like the land and serfs were his . The young boyar called a halt . D'Cey spotted what looked like caltrops dotting the roadway . Fascinated , he swung out of the saddle , walking forward for a closer look . Kneeling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron sprig breaking out of the ground , thick as his thumb and sharp at the tip , with three wicked prongs sprouting from halfway up the stem . Dusk cast long shadows over abandoned fields . D'Cey saw more iron weeds thrusting through the clay roadbed , rising into a forest of tall black trees . Like most everyone D'Cey had heard his fortune misread , and seen weeping beggar women burnt as witches . He had even bought love potions , which never worked on the right women . But here was magic , solid and real , right at his finger tips - as sure as death and as strong as the Devil . A shiver descended his spine . Until now the Iron Wood had been an abstract wonder - like the Great Wall around Cathay . It was totally different to see the metal trees themselves , to realize they were on the march , swallowing farms and fields . Walking back to his pack horse , he unslung the shield hanging from his saddle bow and got out his steel gorges , determined not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , saying , " The lazy sots are supposed to keep the road clear . " D'Cey nodded , picturing villeins down on their knees , weeding with hammers and chisels . He fixed the gorget about his neck knowing leopards went for the throat . A gasp ran through the crowd as he slipped the leather cover off his shield . Serfs crossed themselves , muttering , " Koshka . " " They even fear your shield . " Alexi pointed to the D'Cey crest , a black leopard asleep on a blue field - and above it the family motto , " Do n't Wake Him . " Sending back the horses , they set out walking between the iron sprouts . The sun sank into the tarnished blue and gold of northern twilight . D'Cey had become used to long days and brief nights- he heard the winters were frigid and dark , bleak beyond belief . Fishing into his belt pouch , he got out a sprig of mint to chew on . Normally he used it to freshen his breath ; now he chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ground at the edge of the Iron Wood , pointing out a small . cave blocked with stones and spiked branches , ringed by serfs with lit torches . By now D'Cey thoroughly disliked the whole business . The black iron trees , the darkening landscape , the blocked up hole , and the expectant serfs-none of it boded well . Sucking on his sprig of mint , he suggested waiting for morning . " This half  --  light favors the leopard . A night in that hole without food or water will make the beast far more tractable . " Alexi scoffed , " We are not dealing with a real leopard . This is a devil  --  cat . Remember ? They are not capable of penning a leopard . " D'Cey admitted it seemed unlikely . He knew a lot about leopards his family 's amoral beast . They were smart and wary , with trip-wire senses . No mob of serfs could likely catch one , unless it had been lamed . But D'Cey would happily bed down in a nest of cobras rather than disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alexi insisted on ending things here and now . " They have watched this hole a day and a night , scared to look inside . We can not skulk off , or cower before an empty hole . The main thing is not to show fear before villeins - it makes them insolent and unmanageable . " D'Cey drew his sword , chewing thoughtfully . " Doubtless , you know best . " To D'Cey the main thing was not to be shredded by a leopard . Count D'Medved had made him vaguely responsible for Alexi , but no power came with that responsibility . Like most of his class , the young boyar was quarrelsome , ignorant , and fiercely opinionated , while D'Cey was a mere foreigner , a noble guest , tolerated but not listened to . " Keep the serfs back , " Alexi ordered , meaning to go forward alone . " And make sure no one cocks a bow . " D'Cey nodded . A wild shot in this half-light would skewer some hapless serf . Putting his shield in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , D'Cey would have staked a hundred crowns on the cave being empty-but he would not bet his life on it . Marching up to the hole , his sword sheathed , Alexi briskly rolled the rocks away . One by one he heaved aside the heavy iron branches , then he straightened up , standing triumphantly over the opening . He turned and called for a torch . A spotted streak shot out of the ground , knocking Alexi off his feet . The leopard landed on his throat , cutting short a gurgling scream . For a frozen second the crowd stared in open-mouthed terror . Then the amber and black cat sprang straight at the circle of men . Dropping crossbows and hay rakes , they scattered like scared mice , letting hell take the hindmost . The devil-cat vanished into the Iron Wood . D'Cey found himself standing alone , shield raised and sword drawn , looking foolish . Silence descended , brittle as Barbary glass . Picking up a dropped torch with his shield hand , D'Cey walked over to where the boyar lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His throat ripped open , the talkative young boyar had drowned in his noble blood- making D'Cey doubly glad to be wearing his gorget . He shuddered and shook his head . Gross , boorish , and given to immense airs , Alexi had been a decent enough traveling companion . Prone to pompous soliloquy , but keen as a dagger when talk turned to dogs or women . D'Cey tossed the torch down the hole , standing ready with his sword , sucking on his bit of mint . The way his luck had run , they could easily be facing two leopards . Nothing happened . One leopard , and that one gone . D'Cey looked up at Kara Zamak on its moonlit ridge , with the Iron Wood lapping at its walls . No one had set out from the castle to greet them . They looked to be holing up for the evening-a wise decision . Meaning he must deal with this alone , hardly speaking the language , with the man who had brought him here lying dead . Sheathing his sword , he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to load when the leopard dashed at them . His goat's-foot lever lay nearby , along with a heavy armor-piercing quarrel . Bracing the stock against his leg , D'Cey used the goat's-foot to cock the heavy steel bow- then slid the quarrel into the groove . Only one shot , but that was all you got with a leopard . Too bad it was not a proper broadheaded hunting bolt . Heavy quarrels designed to punch through armor did less damage to a thin-skinned cat . He went through the cocking and loading motions by feel , never taking his gaze off the edge of the Iron Wood . So long as the leopard did not move , the beast would be invisible in that tangle of dark limbs . D'Cey 's only warning would be the flash of the cat leaping from cover . One shot , and cat would be on him , trying to get past the steel at his throat . How could he equalize the contest ? Crawling into the cave and sticking the crossbow out the entrance was no doubt the wisest course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great appeal . The only answer was to go up . Selecting a sturdy looking tree close to the kill site , D'Cey climbed up into the cold metal limbs . Leopards were amazing climbers , but their claws could not bite into iron bark . Only his gloves , boots , and mail shirt got him past the spiked branches . Lying down on a large iron limb , he poked the crossbow ahead of him , resting it on a metal branch , pointed right at the body . The best place to trap a leopard is over its own kill . The body lay on hare ground close to the trees - if the cat came back D'Cey would get a decent shot . He watched and waited . Slowly the moon climbed higher , casting soft spiked shadows . The Iron Wood was dead silent . No night birds called . No hedgehogs snuffled about . What did the leopards live on ? Even the most dedicated man-eater depended on deer , hares , and grouse to fill out his diet . The Iron Wood had none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its kill , especially after a night and day in that cave . Unless this was a devil-cat . Boredom descended . He spit out the last of the mint , which had long lost its taste . He counted his troubles to stay awake . Already D'Cey saw himself blamed for losing this young boyar . Hopefully , when it came time to face the D'Medveds , he would have a dead leopard to show them . So far most Markovites had treated him like a cross between visiting royalty and a criminal lunatic , forced drink on him and demanded tales of the far off west - while forbidding him to play music or pray in Latin . Calling the Pope a heretic and his lyre an instrument of Satan . The place made Transylvania seem civilized . And this was deepest darkest Markovy , at the edge of the Iron Wood . Lying stretched out on the cold iron limb , he remembered white hot summers along the Garonne , sitting in the rippling shade of living plane trees , watching sunlight beat down on terraced vineyards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leopards on his ancestral manor . And warm scented evenings when minstrels played and dancing was no crime . All that was lost . He had not planned to be a penniless exile , living off a noble name . That came from lack of foresight , and astounding ill luck . By first light , he no longer believed that hunger would bring the cat back . Numb with cold , and bored beyond endurance , he shifted his cramped position as silently as he could , until he sat astride the cold iron . Keeping the crossbow pointed at the body , he raised his head to get a better view . Nothing showed . Just the body and the cave entrance , with farm tools and burnt torches lying where they had fallen . Lifting his head he called out , giving his best imitation of a female leopard 's mating cry . Nine out of ten man-eaters were males . Maybe this one would come out for love , if not for a meal . No response . But he kept on calling , mainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short summer night was nearly over . Then , when he least suspected , it happened . Out the corner of his eye , D'Cey saw a movement in the half-light , a shadow sliding along the iron line of trees . He froze , holding tight to the bow , keeping it pointed at the clearing around the body . The movement ceased . Cautiously D'Cey gave the leopard call again , as high and plaintive as he could make it . The shadow slipped closer . He could make it out only when it moved . As soon as the leopard stopped , it seemed to dissolve into the ground . Barely two dozen paces away , the beast blended perfectly into the gray shadows . There the cat could study the clearing from cover , and not come out until the last moment . D'Cey called once more , putting all his talent as a troubadour into the mating cry - all his loneliness in this strange land . The leopard came on , still indistinct , hugging the ground , fading into the shadows near the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming at the most likely spot for the leopard to break cover , hoping his heart was not banging too loud . He needed just one good look at the beast , and he could shoot . He called again . This time he got an answer . From far off to his right came the cry of a leopard , a real . female , competing with his call , challenging him for the man-eater 's affections . Merde ! It was a compliment of sorts , managing to make this distant female jealous . Desperately D'Cey tried to match the mating call , but it was hopeless . Pitted against the real thing , there was no way he could sound half so enticing . The leopard slipped swiftly back along the line of iron trees , disappearing into the metal wood . D'Cey groaned . So much for his powers of seduction . Scapegoat BLOOD RED DAWN showed hot and bright between black iron branches . D'Cey could tell the day would be torrid . He heard his crossbowmen returning , talking to keep their spirits up - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his perch , he ordered them to take care of Alexis body , saying in French , " Cover him up . And get a horse to carry him . " He made lifting and wrapping motions , adding their word for horse - " Loshat . " They understood , or more likely figured it out themselves . It was hard to be commanding when he could not speak the language . With Alexi slung over a plow-mare , D'Cey mounted the hot dusty cattle path leading to the Byzantine-style keep - Kara Zamak , which meant " Black Castle " in the local dialect . Alive , the young boyar had been rude , ignorant , and quarrelsome , but nonetheless useful . Dead , he was a dumb unwanted burden . Even the leopard did not bother to make a meal of him . On his way up to the keep D'Cey saw a woman 's slipper print in the powdery dust . A lucky omen . Tired and dirty , he reached the top , and got a sweeping view of the simmering landscape . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiked barrier with no sane reason for being . To the west undulating steppe stretched endlessly under a bright boiling lead sky . Somewhere to the south caravans toiled over the Silk Road between Far Barbary and Black Cathay . Kara Zamak was cut off from civilized lands not by mountains or rivers , but by limitless hazy distance . D'Cey bet nothing good ever came over that shimmering horizon , just drought , plague , and tax collectors . Plus the odd plundering pagan horde , burning hovels and stealing women . No wonder the weaponless serfs were so paranoid . They had no middle ground . Everything was right on top of them , or unthinkably remote . Waiting to be admitted , he ran an approving eye over Black Castle 's defenses - reminding him of Chateau Gaillard in Normandy , Coeur de Lion 's " beautiful daughter . " Walls sat on solid bedrock , making mining impossible , and on three sides the curtain came right to the edge of a sheer rock ravine only a sparrow could climb . Iron treetops poked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvation , or a costly frontal assault . Beside him at the gate stood a breaking wheel and flogging stake , uncomfortable reminders that boyar law was written with the whip and burning iron . In Markovy , " break every bone in your body " was no mere figure of speech . Kazak archers swung the gate aside , revealing a dry moat and inner drawbridge , protected by a portcullis at each end . With only one approach to defend , tremendous care had been lavished on making the place impregnable . Arrow slits faced inward , covering the inner drawbridge from all sides ; machicolations overhead allowed intruders to be drenched with boiling oil , or something similarly noxious . D'Cey estimated he could hold the gatehouse and flanking towers against all of Christendom with a score of men - a mere dozen if they were fit and willing . In the castle courtyard stood a comely old woman , poised and slender , with heavy-lidded almond eyes-a sign of Kazak blood . In youth she must have been stunning , with high proud cheekbones and skin like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best , wearing cloth-of-silver trimmed with ermine , and a gold comb in her snow-white hair . A scarlet  --  coated dwarf gravely announced , " Lady Ingra Ukhova of Iron Wood . " D'Cey went down on one knee , and a grinning Kazak lifted Alexis head by the hair . Lady Ukhova sniffed , saying , " Here is one who wo n't be missed " - adding something unintelligible in Turkic . Laughing , the Kazak let the head drop . His mistress addressed D'Cey . " Him I knew too well . Who are you ? " " Sir Reynard D'Cey , " he replied , " Chevalier de l'Etoile , et le Baron Cey d'Cey - at your service . " The titles were forfeit , but the feeling lingered . " You are far from home , Monsieur le Baron . " Amused by male formality , she bore down lightly on the last word , knowing the title had to be hollow . " No knight is far from home who serves a fair lady . " A minstrels line , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hordes of unkept gallants vying for her favor . Now she faced arrant bullying by the likes of Alexi D'Medved . Not the least fooled , but nonetheless pleased , Lady Ukhova invited him up off his knees . " Rise , Monsieur le Baron . No doubt you sing sweetly for your supper . " She led him up narrow stone stairs and across an upper drawbridge into the keep . Attackers who got past the lower bridge and both portcullises would find themselves trapped in the courtyard , raked by fire from the battlements . Markovites thought devils lurked in thresholds , refusing to kiss or even shake hands through a doorway . Any serf 's hovel had its hand-carved trolls watching over the clay stoop . Kara Zamak merely took such precautions to extremes- unless they had something extraordinary to fear . D'Cey saw an assailant had already breached the walls . At the base of the courtyard steps a patch of iron weeds poked up between the flagstones , sprouting from solid bedrock . High atop the gatehouse sat an octagonal banquet hall , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Painted archways spattered with bird droppings led to mural chambers and spiral stairs . Stretched above the fireplace was a huge leopard-skin , its bared fangs grinning evilly at D'Cey . Alongside hung a silver-chased hunting crossbow with silken strings , a velvet quiver , and silver-headed quarrels . Dwarfs scurried about , serving up sturgeon roe , pickled tongue , quail eggs , and capons-in lemon and saffron - the first civilized breakfast D'Cey had seen since coming to Markovy . But the giant leopard-skin above the mantel was an unwelcome reminder that he had spent the night in a cold iron tree . A tall butler in be-ribboned garters seated him beside Lady Ukhova 's half-sister , Lady Oghul , a full-blooded Kazak who spoke no French . She had dark crafty eyes framed by straight black hair that hung all the way to the floor . The result was a lively three-sided conversation , half in French , half in Kazak - with Lady Ukhova translating . Between them on the dining table lay a great gilded fleece with gold horns . " Was it a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . " D'Cey nodded at the leopard-skin on the wall . The beast that killed Alexi had been middling at best - the tiger-sized cat on the wall could have had it for supper . " Only one leopard is that big . " Lady Ukhova spoke as if the skin were alive . Lady Oghul wanted to know what brought D'Cey to Kara Zamak . " Whatever plans Lord Alexi D'Medved had are moot , " D'Cey admitted - an agreeable turn of events from the way the women tittered over the translation . " As for me , I first must sleep . Then I mean to track down the cat that killed him . " This ambition provoked scornful amusement . " Alexi D'Medved was a noxious irritant , " Lady Ukhova explained . " The cat who killed him has our utmost sympathy . " D'Cey spread sturgeon roe on black bread with his thumb . " But it will not insult you if I hunt him ? " Both laughed , inviting him to try . " Do your best - it is a devil-cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " D'Cey observed . " And see where it got him , " replied Lady Ukhova primly . " There is no fighting the power of the Iron Wood . My husband tried and it killed him . When I came here as a girl you could not make out the trees from the keep roof ; now they surround us on three sides . " " Devil or not , I must make the attempt , " D'Cey told them . " In a day or so , Count D'Medved himself will be here . I mean to present him with the leopard that killed his nephew . " All smiles ceased . The women traded anguished looks . They had no way of knowing that he and Alexi D'Medved were merely an advance party . He complimented the sturgeon eggs , " Delicious stuff . What do you call this ? " " Caviar , " replied Lady Ukhova dryly . Clearly neither woman welcomed a call from Count D'Medved . Nor did he blame them . There being no Lord Ukhova- no living one anyway- they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Cey licked fish eggs off his fingers . " Paris would go wild for this , particularly with champagne . " Bringing back a barrel or two would easily redeem him at court . But first sleep . Surfeited on quail eggs and pickled tongue , he begged somewhere to lie down . Lady Oghul led him up some spiral stairs to a bed chamber hung with animal heads- Lord Ukhova had been an avid huntsman . His canopied bed had a squirrel-skin coverlet , but the sheets beneath were satin . D'Cey was asleep the moment his head touched the velvet pillow . He awoke staring into the dead face of a long-nosed steppe antelope , thinking he was in some ghastly waking dream . Sitting bolt upright he remembered where he was , and what he had to do . Soon he would be facing Count D'Medved . That meeting would go much better if D'Cey had something to show him besides a dead nephew . Clean linens and a green silk surcoat were laid out for him . Dressing swiftly , he pulled on his mail shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the banquet hall , begging leave to go . Lady Ukhova gave indifferent permission . Whistling up a couple of crossbowmen , he rode down the dusty path to the kill site . It was the hottest part of the day , and the Iron Wood gave no shade . Heat reflected mercilessly off the metal trunks . Dismounting , he went carefully over the area around the cave , finding the baked-hard ground too firm to take prints . A single bloody paw mark confirmed his original impression of a smallish leopard , probably young and vigorous . Somewhat strange . Man-eaters tended to be older cats unable to take normal prey . He stood up , taking a deep breath of scorching air . From overhead he heard the beat of wings and a rattle like hail . Looking up at the chalk white sky , he saw a flock of crows settling into the branches above him , claws clattering on the iron bark . Scores of black carrion eaters squawked to one another , eyeing him boldly . Hardly a - welcome omen . As he remounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot chalk sky . From the saddle he saw another great mob of ill-armed men storming up the road from the village , dangerously agitated , trailing tearful women and frightened children - alarming even the Iron Wood crows . Chaos and confusion ensued . Jabbering serfs surrounded his horse , shouting demands D'Cey could not understand . He had hoped to somehow communicate with his crossbowmen , then question the serfs through them . Instead an angry jostling crowd trod on each other 's toes , waving makeshift weapons and yelling at him in gibberish , pointing excitedly at the leopard on his shield . Amid the babble , someone behind him inquired in passable French , " Can I help you ? " Startled , D'Cey twisted in the saddle , seeing a glowering Kazak in leather and mail sitting atop a stocky pony , a bow slung across his back and a heavy mace hanging from his saddle . His presence created a clear space in the crowd , even the most hysterical serf giving him ample room It took a second to realize that this grotesque nomad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-haired girl in a velvet dress , wearing a silver comb with a spray of pearls . Her luminous almond eyes exactly matched those of Lady Ukhova . She asked again , " May I be of assistance ? " Taken aback , D'Cey saw this was the " marriageable daughter " Alexi had mentioned - the heiress the D'Medveds hoped to annex . Standing in the shade of the Kazak , she did not look much above twelve or so . Swinging out of the saddle , he dropped to one knee . " Sir Reynard Cey D'Cey , at your service . " It felt awkward bowing to a half-grown girl , but he meant to be on everyone 's good side . " Call me Klara , " she told him , motioning him to rise . " Please forgive my people . They have never seen a French baron before . Or any foreigner not a Kazak or Tartar . They think you a demon . They do n't know whether to fall down and worship you , or stone you to death . " D'Cey thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my needs at the moment . " Reaching out a slim finger , she traced the sleeping leopard on his shield . " You are the leopard hunter ? " He heard the same scorn her mother had shown , tinged with childish awe . " Today I am - though it is not my normal calling . " Gentleman of leisure was more his mark . " I prefer to hunt something harmless and tasty . Ducks perhaps , though I have lately become fond of fish eggs . " No plate of caviar ever bit back . " But you are hunting one now , " she sounded accusing . " Only because he is hunting us . Which is why I need to ask these people if there is a man-killer about . " She switched from French to Markovite . At her first word the mob turned meek . From her tone D'Cey could tell she did not speak down to the serfs the way Alexi had - they were " her people . " She sounded marvelously condescending , her face softening as she heard them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in noblesse oblige . Cynicism came with age . She turned back to D'Cey , big eyes brimming with tears . " It is so very sad , " she told him . " " There has been a killing - just now . A woman this time . Her cowardly husband seat her to gather firewood . Men heard her screams and saw the leopard run her down . She was young . Not much older than I , and newly married . " Her tears touched him . D'Cey had never seen a Markovite give a moldy fig for some hapless serf woman-much less cry over one . He asked to see where it happened . Klara lifted her velvet skirt and they trooped off over untended fields toward the new kill site , trailed by the crowd . Nothing so far prepared D'Cey for what came next . Flies buzzed in the heat . Ahead lay the abandoned orchard where the girl-bride had been gathering sticks . Rows of rotting fruit lying between lanes of trees made the broiling air smell syrupy . Before they made the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-naked on hands and knees . It was the victim - her clothing ripped from her upper body , and blood flowing down her face . Everyone dashed forward , all shouting at once . Men yelled and pointed , demanding D'Cey to do something . Heaven knows what . Klara 's sadness turned to sudden fury . Screaming at the serfs , she called them names , scolding and stamping her slippered foot . That silenced them : They fell full out on the ground , groveling in abject fear , scrambling to kiss the hem of her dress . D'Cey remembered the stake and breaking wheel at the castle gate . Here even a child had better be feared . Klara turned to him , angry and imperious , eyes blazing . " They say she will surely die . They want to carry her back to where she was attacked , so you can wait over her for the leopard . I said I would see them all bound , blinded , and flogged to death first . " Admirable sentiments , if a trifle extreme . D'Cey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole debate . Her blue eyes wide with fear and shock - she looked at best about fourteen . Blood from a huge scalp wound flowed down her cheek and neck into the soft hollow between her breasts . Gritting his teeth , he told Klara , " Have them get back . Give her room to breathe . Tell the women to bring hot water-boiling if possible . " Shooing the frightened men away , Klara rapped orders to the women . D'Cey stripped off his gorget , silk surcoat , and chain mail , to get at his clean linen shirt . He ripped the gift undershirt into long strips to use as bandages : Women returned with water that was barely tepid . Serfs had gone for days with only twigs to feed their fires . D'Cey decided it had to do . Claw marks ran in red furrows down the girl 's back . Her scalp wound went from her forehead clear to the nape of the neck . She said the leopard grabbed her from behind as she ran , jerking her backward . Deep puncture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his jaws and bit down , miraculously missing her spine and jugular . At that point the girl fainted , giving herself up for dead . The leopard must have thought so too , because he dropped her and departed . Happy with his kill , but riot particularly hungry . D'Cey had an Arab potion passed down in his family to treat big cat bites and slashes . After washing the wounds with the lukewarm water , he poured the better part of the bottle over them . Liquid ran in one neck wound and out another . Having cleaned the wounds as best he could , he bound them with strips of shirt . When he was done , he stood up , saying , " This is why I must kill that leopard . " Klara shot him an angry look . " Kill him ? That is ridiculous . How could you ever hope to ? " D'Cey pulled his mail shirt back on , its steel links felt cool against his bare chest . " Have them bring me a goat and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While they waited , D'Cey told how his family in Gascony had learned the art of breeding big cats from the Arabs - " I have raised them from cubs . Big leopards like you have here , and the small swift ones called cheetahs . " He knew their habits and could imitate their cries - " Though not well enough to fool them . " Klara remained unimpressed . The goat arrived and D'Cey walked the bleating animal back to the original kill site at the edge of the Iron Wood . He staked the goat in the path the leopard had used , rigging a trap with the crossbow he picked up the night before and the two his bowmen had brought . Tying the bows to metal trunks , he set them to fire from three directions right at the goat , running trip lines from their triggers so the leopard could not get at the bait without firing at least one of the bows . Then he fixed a slack line to the goat stake . Leopards did not like to dine on the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling off the carcass would fire all three bows at once . Klara ridiculed the arrangement . " Bows wo n't kill a ghost cat . " D'Cey shrugged . " Any leopard real enough to kill a man , savage a girl , or eat a goat can be done in by crossbows . " He went over the ground on hands and knees , making sure there was nothing to alert the leopard-not a heel print , not so much as an overturned leaf . Satisfied that even a ghost leopard would find nothing amiss with this meal , he stood up , telling Klara , " Warn your people not to touch any of this . " An unnecessary precaution . Stealing a crossbow , or molesting a lord 's goat , could get a serf impaled . If the devil-cat did not track him down first . Common sense and superstitious awe would keep them well away from the kill site . Klara watched the unwilling sacrifice bleat and tug at its stake , saying , " Think what it must be like . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt good . But if he did not get his cat Lord D'Medved would make him into a scapegoat - which could easily be even less pleasant . " No , " Klara shook her head . " What must it be like to catch living food in your teeth . To bite down on a goat 's throat and feel hot blood spurt into your mouth . To strip raw reeking flesh from the bone . " Charming thoughts in a half-grown girl . Far from pitying the goat , she put herself in the leopard 's place - but Markovites never pretended to be civilized . Klara insisted on taking the mauled girl home , saying the husband forfeited any claim to her by sending her to gather sticks , then leaving her to the leopard . D'Cey noted that the man was unarmed . Klara snorted , " Would that stop you ? Would you stand by and see a helpless girl carried off ? " An uncomfortable question , as Klara well knew . D'Cey could only say he hoped not to be put to that test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with an exceptionally decent Bordeaux . As much as he sympathized with the serfs- huddled hungry and defenseless in their unlit hovels while a maneater stalked outside - there was still an indolent satisfaction in picking minced quail from his teeth with a jeweled pick worth more than a commoner earned in a lifetime . Vastly superior to living on beet roots and stiff beatings . Lady Ukhova even let him play his lyre for the first time since coming to Markovy - where melodies made by anything but the human voice were mortal sins . Klara was not allowed to join them , to keep her from being corrupted by the music . Afterward he went to check on the wounded serf-girl , finding her asleep . Klara sat beside the bed wearing a long embroidered silk chemise , carefully cleaning the wounds . D'Cey could not help being happy to see her , though she ought not to be alone with a lyre-playing heretic , and only a comatose serf for chaperon . Already there was an unspoken bond between them , doubtless due in part to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from a footloose French baron than to wait and be instructed by the D'Medveds . He inquired after their patient . Klara responded with one of her cryptic shrugs . " She sleeps . And her wounds are not festering . " " When she wakes , see that she eats , " D'Cey suggested . " And has bandages washed in boiling water . " She nodded dutifully , adding , " You know you will never get this leopard . " D'Cey raised an eyebrow . " Really ? " " Of , course . " She gave a pitying look . " Any traps you set are bound to fail . " Less distant and regal than her mother , Klara could be twice as nettlesome . No wonder the D'Medveds meant to whip the Ukhova women into obedience - they must make difficult neighbors . " These devil-cats are a special curse on our family , " she told him . " You have seen the leopard-skin above the mantel ? " " How could I miss it ? " " My father went into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , its spirit has haunted us . It killed my father , and will not rest until we are all consumed , including me . I am the last of the line , and a daughter only - all our sons are dead . " D'Cey observed that she seemed curiously unmoved by this impending doom . She gave another cryptic shrug . " I have lived with it all my life . " He shook his head . " Why do n't you cut it to pieces ? " " The devil-cat ? " She laughed . " We would have to catch it first . Father died trying . " " No , that leopard-skin above the mantle . I would not have it hanging over my head . " Klara smirked . " And you say you know leopards . That skin is our only claim on the cat 's power . Destroying it would leave us defenseless . " D'Cey had no ready answer . Taking a long look at him , she inquired sweetly , " Is it true you are a eunuch ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . " " Then it is true ? " Klara sounded triumphant . . D'Cey fought an unknightly impulse to turn her over his knee . Which could easily be what the child wanted - it was probably years since she was properly spanked . If ever . All the best manuscripts on child rearing recommended regular beatings . Klara could certainly use a couple . " I merely shave my face , " he told her . " Many foreigners do . " " May I watch ? " " Absolutely not . " Disliking the tone of the conversation , D'Cey bade her good-bye and departed - a gentleman 's toilet was a personal matter between him and his valet . Water clocks chimed Compline , and D'Cey retired to the family library . The Ukhovas had a great trove of illuminated manuscripts in Cyrillic , Greek , and even French and Latin , including beautiful copies of Froissart 's Chronicles . Boccaccio 's Decameron , and Christine de Pisan 's La Cite des Dames . Long summer twilights let him read late into the night - winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Malory 's Morse d'Arthur back to his bedroom . Opening at random , he found himself in the middle of Book IX . The adventures of Launcelot , Lamorak , Tristram , and La Belle Isoud soon put him to sleep . He was awakened by a dog barking . Swinging out of bed , he bounded up to the wall walk . A little hairy mop of a dog stood balanced in an embrasure , barking furiously . The moon was up , and a night breeze was blowing from the direction of the kill site . The dog had seen or smelled something . D'Cey nearly broke his neck dashing back down the dark steps . Pulling on his mail shirt , he fixed his gorget around his throat , and struggled into his boots . Up on the battlements the dog kept on barking . Grabbing a boar spear off the wall , he stuffed a tinderbox and wax tapers into his belt pouch . It was useless to order out the bowmen - no rightthinking Markovite hunted devil-cats in the dark . But if the leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the beast off . Bounding back up to the battlements , he scooped up the dog , who continued to bark excitedly . Carrying it down to the courtyard , he ordered startled Kazaks to open the gate - requiring a flurry of hand signals , and further delay . Once outside he set the dog on its feet , and they raced together down the footpath . D'Cey slowed as he approached the kill site , letting the dog go ahead . The goat was gone . Lighting a taper , he checked the crossbows and trip lines . All three bows had been fired , but no bolt had hit the leopard . Each bow had been nudged from behind to slacken the trip lines , then discharged harmlessly into the ground . After taking its time disarming the bows , the devil-cat had made off with the doomed goat . The little dog kept barking his head off , wanting to follow the leopard into the Iron Wood . D'Cey picked the dog up , saying , " You 're braver than I , " then trudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open on his bed . The first lines of the upcoming chapter read : And then there came the good Sir Palomides , following the Questing Beast that had a head like a serpent , feet like a hart , buttocks like a lion , and a body like a leopard .... " Perfect . He felt just like the wandering ill-fated Palomides , chasing a will-o ' - the- wisp with the body of a leopard and a brain equal to his . Snuffing out his taper , D'Cey threw himself full out onto the bed , falling instantly asleep , still in his boots . At-first light he returned to collect the crossbows . On his way down the dusty path he came upon his boot prints from the night before , headed the other way . On top of his own prints he saw the pug marks of a mediumsized leopard , following him up the path as he made his weary way back to Kara Zamak . The devil-cat that killed Alexi had started stalking him . Count D'Medved AT DUSK D'CEY stood on the wall walk seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dull gold dust dwarfed by immense darkening plain . Despite the fading light he knew they were cavalry by the easy way they ate up ground . Farther back came a bigger cloud that could be wagons . By nightfall they would be at the gate . Lady Ukhova herself came to look , done up to meet her doom in ermine and cloth-of-silver . D'Cey feared he would not cut half so good a figure . " You do n't have to let them in , " he suggested . Kara Zamak 's defenses were magnificent , and her Kazaks seemed tolerably loyal . Lady Ukhova gave him a cold glance , not anxious to share her plans with D'Cey . If the mother would not - maybe the daughter would . Descending the stone stairs , he found Klara tending the wounded serf , a task she plainly relished . Changing bandages , administering potions , dictating the youngwoman 's toilet and diet , all fed Klara 's sense of control . An absolute necessity now that armed men were coming to tear her away from her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seeing him enter , she put down her bowl and spoon . " Why have you come ? " " To see how you are faring . " Klara laughed mirthlessly . " What if a stranger was on his way to seize you , coming to drag you off to his bed , to strip you naked and force his sweaty body on you , whether you willed it or not ? Beating you into obedience . How would you feel ? " D'Cey grimaced . Not a troubadour 's version of true love . " I suppose I would fight it . " " Just so . " Klara turned back to her puzzled patient , who listened to the whole heated exchange in French . How much choice had she had in her marriage ? Not much , D'Cey supposed . But serfs were born to be someone 's property . This whole interlude must be amazingly unreal to her - mauled by a leopard , miraculously saved , lodged in a castle bed swathed in silks , hand-fed by a young noble woman - a real-life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to fight - but before he could Lady Oghul bustled in , smiling and speaking Kazak . Klara 's eyes widened , her face broke into a grin . Whatever the news , it was good . " What 's she saying ? " D'Cey demanded . " It is not the D'Medveds , " Klara crowed happily , looking for once like a child should . " Aunt Ghul says get ready to greet Prince Sergey , Grand Duke of Ikstra . " Racing back up to the wall walk , D'Cey peered out an embrasure . Aunt " Ghul " was right ; the riders below wore the embattled blue bend of Royal Horse Guards - not the D'Medved martlet Or . An unbelievable reprieve . Behind the Horse Guards came Prince Sergey 's baggage wagons , big gilt-covered gypsy caravans trimmed in royal blue . What had been a siege had become a party , giving him one more day to get his leopard . Returning to his room , he changed into a crimson surcoat laid out on his bed . In a castle run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his sword , he went down to greet the Grand Duke . D'Cey had met Prince Sergey Mikhailovich in the capital - a tall aging courtier who dressed like a peacock and spoke pitiful French - half-brother to King Demitri , third in line for the throne of Markovy . At home he might have made a decent bailiff on some provincial estate ; here he was Grand Duke of Ikstra , Baron Suzdal , and holder of a dozen lesser titles . At the upper drawbridge he let Klara and Lady Oghul go ahead of him . He could not see Prince Sergey in the torchlit court . Doubtless the old Duke was lodged in one of the bullock wagons , which were sumptuously outfitted , like drawing rooms on wheels . Lady Ukhova waited below , with a Horse Guards Captain down on one knee before her , his plumed helm held in the crook of his arm . Reaching out , D'Cey seized Klara 's shoulder , swiftly spinning the girl around . He hissed , " Have your Kazaks drop the portcullises and lift the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . Nothing if not quick , she dashed back into the gatehouse . Pushing past Lady Oghul , D'Cey descended into the courtyard , loosening his sword . He heard the bullock wagons rumble onto the lower drawbridge as he strode over to where Lady Ukhova stood , with the knight in Horse Guards colors kneeling before her . " Your ladyship , " he called out , nodding casually at the stairs , " your daughter needs you within . " She shot him a questioning look . The man at her feet tried to rise , but D'Cey had his sword out and at the man 's throat , advising him , " Do n't get up on my account . " With a crash the inner portcullis came rattling down , catching the lead bullock wagon as it came off the drawbridge . Reinforced beams with ironshod points crunched through the gilded cart , splitting it all the way to the axle . Bullocks bellowed , and men tumbled out of the splintered wagon-they had little gold birds stitched on their tunics , the D'Medved yellow martlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , saying , " Damn you D'Cey . What are you doing ? " He was a guard captain but not Prince Sergey 's . He was a D'Medved man-at-arms , one who owed D'Cey money . D'Cey could have cut him down , but bloodshed now would spark a full out battle - and cancel any chance of collecting his debt . Instead D'Cey put his back to the stairs , covering Lady Ukhova 's retreat . A halfdozen men-at-arms in Horse Guards colors rushed up to defend their bogus captain . Above them , Kazak archers drew bow - but would not likely fire with Lady Ukhova in the courtyard . D'Cey glanced at the gate and saw the second caravan jammed under the outer portcullis , its weight keeping the drawbridge from rising . The whole intricate gate mechanism was neatly foiled . Like a devil emerging from the threshold , a middle-aged brigand in armor separated himself from the wrecked bullock cart , ducking under the portcullis . Count D'Medved had a bald pate and a big black beard . He drank too much and laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with his upcountry manners , and could be fiendish clever at times - like now . Straightening up , he strode over to where D'Cey stood facing a half-dozen of his men disguised as Horse Guards . D'Medvedmade a mock bow . " Monsieur le Baron , we meet again . " D'Cey saluted him with his sword , " At your service . " " Would it were so . " D'Medved 's smile was all beard and teeth . " I expected better of you . " " And I expected Prince Sergey . " D'Medved laughed wickedly . " The Grand Duke is detained - affairs of state and such . I came in his place . I hear that my nephew Alexi is dead , and his body used to bait a leopard ? " " I was trying catch his killer . " " Yet yesterday you refused to use a serf the same way ? " Count D'Medved appeared alarmingly well informed . D'Cey painted out that Alexi was dead , " While the serf woman is still very much alive . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled . His nephew was worth any number of serfs , alive or dead . D'Cey saw he had no defense for his actions , except his sword . " She was my serf . " Lady Ukhova spoke up , standing at the foot of the stairs . " I would not let him use her as bait . " " Is that so ? " D'Medved turned to the woman he came to intimidate . He did not look convinced , indeed he probably knew better , but merely waved absently to his men . " Disarm him . We can deal with Monsieur le Baron later . " D'Cey hefted his sword . He had seen Markovite executions , with the condemned hauled naked to the breaking wheel in a dung cart drawn by swine . Better to die blade in hand . But Lady Ukhova would not let him make a brave scene . Stepping between them , she told him , " Put down your sword and Leave us-the Count and I must talk . " D'Cey lowered his blade , letting D'Medved 's men wrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she insisted , tilting her head toward the gatehouse steps . " See to my daughter . " D'Cey went . Dying in that courtyard would have done no one any good - least of all him . Though heaven knows what good he could do in the gatehouse . At the upper drawbridge , he looked back to see Lady Ukhova facing down D'Medved and his men . How long could that brave front last ? D'Medved would demand nothing short of total surrender . Flames lit the banquet hail . Klara stood before an unseasonal roaring fire , her back to him , feeding something into the flames . He hurried over , afraid the girl meant to harm herself ; instead he found her calmly stuffing the huge leopard skin into the fireplace . As the stench of burning hair and hide filled the banquet hall , she straightened up , saying , " Now there is nothing left to save . " Nothing but their lives . D'Cey took down the hunting crossbow and its velvet quiver , an elegant silver-chased bow cocked by a winding-crank built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped a silver-headed quarrel into place . At best he had one shot - he would never have time to recrank the bow . But how to use his single shot ? He could not picture himself just shooting Count D'Medved . Not when his guards were right there , ready to take revenge . Boots rang on the narrow courtyard steps . Klara vanished up spiral stairs into the floor above . D'Cey beat a retreat into the nearest mural chamber . Finding a wall niche , half-hidden behind a tapestry , he slipped into it , whispering a fervid prayer to the Virgin , begging Her blessed intervention . Nothing short of a miracle would get him out of this alive and whole . Lady Ukhova entered the banquet hall , calmly ordering wine for her " guests . " D'Cey heard dwarfs scurrying about , keeping D'Medved 's men happy . Servants raised the upper drawbridge . With the main gate blocked by the wrecked bullock carts , the upper bridge became the keep 's last defense - not that it mattered a lot with D'Medved 's men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of him . Night fell . The niche he picked housed a tall arrow slit , the type vulgarly named for intimate female anatomy . Moonlight entered through the firing slit , falling onto the floor of the mural chamber , letting D'Cey mark the passage of time by watching it move over the carpeted floor . Weariness crept over . him . Sitting slumped in the niche , clutching his crossbow , he glumly listened to drunken feasting in the banquet hall - a party he should be part of if there were any justice in the world . He started to doze . Suddenly a new sound jerked him awake . It was well past midnight by his makeshift clock . On the landing that led to the upper drawbridge , a dog had begun to bark . Hairs rose on the back of his neck . Through the arrow slit he could see a thin slice of darkened courtyard , half in moonlight , half in shadow . He did not need to see into those dense shadows to know what had happened . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slipping out of his niche , he moved toward the mural chamber 's open archway . Drinking sounds grew more raucous . Through the archway he saw D'Medved sitting at the head of the table , with Lady Ukhova beside him , keeping his goblet filled . Above the boyar 's head was the huge bare spot where the leopard skin had been . Outside he could hear the dog barking his head off . The leopard was moving invisibly in the darkness , easily able to leap the gap at the upper drawbridge . When that happened their only warning would be the little dog dashing into the banquet hall , tail tucked between his legs , the devil  --  cat hot on his heels . Flattening himself against the stonework , D'Cey had a good view of D'Medved and Lady Ukhova , but could not see the door to the landing that the dog would come flying through . He checked the tension on his crossbow . If the leopard was coming for Lady Ukhova , the dog would give him enough warning to get off a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the leopard was coming for him , D'Cey hated to waste a quarrel . There was no warning . No frightened dog dashed into the banquet hall . As D'Medved happily raised a goblet to his lips , an amber streak burst from the foot of the spiral stairwell leading to the upper apartments . There was no time for a shot . Before the startled Count could set down his cup , the cat was on him . Borne backward , the drunken boyar crashed down behind the table with the leopard atop him , his chair shattering as he hit . Servants shrieked . Dwarfs scattered in terror . D'Medved lay thrashing on the floor with the snarling beast tearing at his throat . Drunken guardsmen tried to leap up and draw their swords without tripping over the table . Shouts of " My God ! " and " What ho ? " and " Treason ! " filled the flag-draped hall . Only Lady Ukhova seemed unperturbed . Picking up D'Medved 's fallen goblet , she poured herself more wine , laughing wildly as the leopard savaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged the head of the table , chasing the leopard off their master . As the beast let go , the boyar flopped onto his back , bleeding profusely from the neck . Only immediate attention could save him , but D'Cey could see he would not get any . His guards were busy taking drunken swipes at the leopard , who easily avoided them . Dwarfs and servants cowered in the corners . And none of the castle women were going to leap to D'Medved 's aid . Somehow D'Cey had to turn the commotion to his advantage . The boyar who had threatened him was busily bleeding to death by the fire . Set to take " French leave " - if he only had somewhere to go-D'Cey glanced at the doorway leading to the courtyard . A little mop of a dog come yapping into the hall , eyes wide , tail between his legs . D'Cey leveled his crossbow , bracing himself for what was about to happen . Only Lady Ukhova seemed to notice . She stopped laughing and set down her goblet , looking terrified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard D'Cey had ever seen , a tiger-sized male twice as big as the first cat . He took the guardsmen totally by surprise , landing on the back of one , knocking him down and scattering the others . Drunken courage evaporated . When it had been six of them against a single smallish leopard , the guardsmen had liked the odds . Now they were five , facing two cats , one of them huge , and both blindingly fast . Dragging their fallen comrade , they retreated to the mural chambers , dwarfs and servants cowering behind them . Having driven the humans to cover , the two cats started hissing and swatting at each other . Clearly overmatched , the smaller leopard backed , turned , and bounded up the spiral stairway , with the big male in hot pursuit . D'Cey saw at once what he had to do . With his bow in front of him , he dashed up the stairs after the two cats . He had eaten Lady Ukhova 's bread - spread with caviar no less - and worn her colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse on her house . He caught up with the leopards at the first landing , still snarling and swiping at each other . Seeing him appear , the smaller leopard backed down the hall toward the open door of Lady Oghul 's room . The big male leaped after her - making it plain what he had in mind . D'Cey 's own room was next to the landing . He ducked inside , snapping on his gorget and grabbing up the boar spear . He could hear the cats just down the hall , hissing and snarling . D'Cey took a deep breath . This is it . Make your shot count , then be ready with the boar spear . Stepping into the hall , he brought the crossbow to his shoulder . The big male had the smaller leopard backed all the way into Lady Oghul 's room , but could not force his way through the narrow door . As the spotted monster arched his back , D'Cey took aim . With no clear shot at the head or chest , he went for the spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft prayer to St. Denis , he squeezed the silver trigger lever . And missed . As the bow fired , the big cat spun about to face this new threat . The silver-headed quarrel buried itself in the beast 's ribs . Fangs out , the wounded leopard sprang straight at D'Cey . Flung over backward , he managed to get the boar spear in front of him , but the big cat bounded over him and disappeared up the spiral stairs . Staggering to his feet , D'Cey threw himself against the door to Lady Oghul 's room , slamming it shut , trapping the smaller leopard inside . He felt the cat thud against the door , then slap at the latch . Angry and smart . If he let go she would be out in no time . Fortunately the crossbow 's velvet quiver had a pouch containing spare quarrel points and bowstrings . Leaning against the door , he managed to extract a string and tie down the latch . One cat down , one to go . Stepping away from the door , he cranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hear the trapped leopard banging against the door . Satisfied she could not escape , he picked up the boar spear and sprinted for the stairs - determined to get a second shot at her would-be mate . Blood on the stairs told him the wounded cat had headed up to the battlements , not back down to the banquet hall . He took the steps two at a time , crossbow in one hand , boar spear in the other . Half way up he came on a Kazak lying sprawled head down on the steps . Stone dead , having fallen from somewhere above - a sure sign the wounded devil-cat was still dangerous . Not that D'Cey ever doubted it . Stepping over the dead Kazak , D'Cey continued more gingerly , watching each step . He could hear the little castle dog barking somewhere above . First light came falling down the stairwell as the short summer night faded . D'Cey stopped at the final twist in the stair . The opening at the head of the stairs formed a big dazzling square of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle dog continued to bark . He took another step , edging closer to the opening above . Something dark and shining fell past his cheek , splatting onto his glove . He looked down and saw blood . There was more of it on the step at his feet . As he watched , another gleaming drop hit his boot . Someone was bleeding just above him . This was a wounded leopard trick , doubling back to lie up over his own spoor . Pointing the cocked crossbow at the square of light , D'Cey began to back up the stairwell . The devil-cat would be waiting just behind the lip of the opening , tracking him by the scrape of his boots . Only the chance fall of blood had revealed the ambush . When he reached the top steps , D'Cey doubled his legs beneath him , getting ready to spring . He took a deep purposeful breath . Then he leaped the last two steps , firing at the black shape lying in wait above the opening . It was another dead Kazak , face down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of the leopard . Which was good since D'Cey had wasted a shot , putting a silver-headed quarrel into one of Lady Ukhova 's late retainers . Cursing his stupidity , he frantically cranked the crossbow . He thought he would not have time to recrank it- now he seemed to be doing nothing else . Slipping a quarrel into the bow , he surveyed the gatehouse battlements . Dawn was coming up . The two sentries on duty were dead . The little dog stood perched on the southern parapet , barking his head off . He at least would not mistake a dead Kazak for a leopard lying in wait . D'Cey slid over to see what the dog was barking at . Peering past the parapet , he saw an empty stretch of curtain wall connecting the gatehouse to an adjacent tower . Drawing back , he studied the parapet , finding a patch of blood on the stone . This had to be leopard blood . The devil-cat had gone over the parapet , which meant he had to follow . There was no door or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - so if an enemy breached the curtain they could not get into the gatehouse . Access to the wall walk was through a door in the adjacent tower . Looking about for some way down , he saw the nearest dead Kazak had a lariat around his waist . D'Cey disliked robbing the dead - but in this case he was just borrowing . He anchored the rope to the battlement , then tossed the free end down to the wall walk . Tucking the boar spear under his arm , he picked up the little dog , then swung his legs over the parapet . Keeping one hand on the rope , and clutching the dog , spear , and crossbow , D'Cey lowered himself over the lip of the parapet . Halfway down , he slipped , losing his hold on the rope . He dropped the last dozen feet , coming down hard , and wrenching an ankle . Cursing mightily , he managed to get the crossbow pointed down the wall walk . But there was no sign of the leopard , just a long line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Kazak archers to hide behind . The leopard could be waiting in any one of them . Setting down the dog , D'Cey could see that the far door was closed , and no doubt barred from within . Men milled about in the courtyard below . On the far side of the curtain lay the deep rocky ravine choked with iron-spiked trees . That left only the shadowy line of embrasures - unless the devil-cat somehow sprouted wings . The dog took off down the wall walk , barking to wake the dead . Either brave or brainless - which were often hard to tell apart . D'Cey limped after the foolhardy canine , keeping the crossbow leveled and the boar spear ready . Short on sleep , with no supper , he hoped to end this swiftly . And happily . D'Cey did not have far to limp . Hearing a thin rasping hiss from behind one of the embrasures , he saw the dog start to dance wildly about . Saying a swift Hail Mary , D'Cey dodged around the short wing wall , crossbow in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow . The biggest leopard he had ever seen sat crouched in the embrasure , back to the dawn sky , swatting at the dog with one paw . As soon as he appeared the leopard froze , forgetting the dog , giving D'Cey a look of primal hate and contempt . Dawn broke behind the beast , gleaming on metal treetops . Only the dog 's demented barking shattered the morning silence . Aiming at a rosette right atop the devil-cat 's chest , D'Cey slowly squeezed the trigger lever . That slight movement provoked a leap . Had he waited to see where the quarrel hit , D'Cey would have been dead . As soon as he fired , he let go of the bow . Couching the boar spear like a lance , he drove it into the charging devil-cat . He had been quick , but not near as quick as the cat . Twisting in midair , the leopard took the point in the shoulder , crashing into D'Cey . Hissing and snarling , the beast came right up the spear shaft , slashing at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Cey . Had the point gone deeper , the leopard would have been on him , tearing at his face . Bracing his boot against the short inner parapet , D'Cey screamed aloud , throwing every ounce of being behind the spear . Catching the leopard off balance , he shoved the devil-cat back into the embrasure . Claws scraped on stone - but could not hold . D'Cey flung the leopard through the open embrasure into empty space . Letting go of the spear shaft , he watched the huge cat cartwheel into the ravine below , taking the boar spear with him . The beast hit the base of the curtain , bounced outward , then disappeared among the black branches of the Iron Wood . D'Cey muttered a heartfelt , " Au revoir . " He did not think for a moment that the devil-cat was dead - but hopefully it would not be back anytime soon . Picking up the crossbow , he patted the little dog on the rump , then hauled himself up the rope onto the gatehouse . Without bothering to reload the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room . How many times had he been up or down these steps ? Half a dozen at least between dusk and dawn . An absolutely ghastly night . The spare bowstring was still tying down the latch ; untying it , he opened the door , betting a lot that he would not see a leopard . He did n't . Sunlight slanted through high windows onto Klara sitting on her aunt 's bed , wrapped in the fur coverlet but otherwise naked , her tear-stained eyes wide and staring . Flecks of dried blood clung to the corners of her mouth . More blood showed on her long sharp nails . He sat down on the bed beside her , saying , " I am sorry . I did not know . " She looked up at him . " Did not know what ? " " Well for one , that I was fixing crossbows to shoot at you . " She smirked . " Small chance they had of hitting anything . " " I did my best . " What an imbecile he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining to this poor childish savage how he meant to trap her . " It does not matter . " She shrugged . " What of the devil-cat ? " " I sent him back to the Iron Wood-with a few new holes in his hide . " D'Cey felt proud of himself , despite his twisted ankle and a couple of botched crossbow shots . He planned to turn the episode into a ballad . No proper poetic retelling need dwell on how he leaped at the sight of blood and shot a dead Kazak . " He will return , " Klara replied glumly , picking at the blood on her nails : D'Medved blood . " Doubtless , " D'Cey agreed . " But what about you ? " he asked , trying to be as delicate as he could . " This thing that happens - it comes on only at night ? " She nodded , still staring moodily at her nails . " When the moon is up and near to full . " " How long has it been going on ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice way of asking how long have you been changing into a she-leopard ? " It began this spring , along with my monthly flow . " Giving a whole new meaning to " the Curse . " He shook his head in wonder . " So it was you in the cave the other night ? " She shuddered . " Yes . For the first few nights I stayed confined to the castle . But when the demon cat started calling to me , I could not resist . He meant to mate with me , and teach me to kill . But the villagers chased me into that cave . It was terrible . I spent a whole day huddled and naked in that hole , until night fell , and the moon rose , then I changed back .... " And Alexi D'Medved swaggered up , aiming to show everyone the hole was empty . D'Cey felt vaguely sorry for his former hosts . The D'Medveds had come to Kara Zamak expecting to swoop down on a castle full of women , enjoying a little honest rapine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deadly curse , falling prey to devil cats dueling over a haunted landscape . D'Cey sighed heavily . " And you have not killed anyone aside from Count D'Medved and his nephew ? " " And your goat . " " Ah , yes , the goat - Well , it was not mine really , only borrowed . " He had been made to look a fool too , but not as badly as the D'Medveds . " It is only a matter of time . " Klara shook her head miserably . " So long as that beast calls to me from the Iron Wood - a night will come when I am his , bearing his cubs and killing at his side . Then the family curse will be complete . " " There must be something we can do . " He limped off to see her mother . It was just his luck that the sole D'Medved retainer struck down by the devil-cat was the Guard Captain who owed him money - forever canceling that debt . But it put Lady Ukhova firmly back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bold enough to do more than haul home the bodies of Count D'Medved and their Guard Captain . Servants were still scrubbing up blood in the banquet hall , so Lady Ukhova granted him an audience in her privy chamber . After receiving her thanks.for ridding the castle of the devil-cat , D'Cey broached the delicate question of what to do about her daughter . Lord knows Klara was not his problem , but he had become involved , and wanted to see something done for her . To save having risked his life for nothing . " She must go away , " the Lady of Kara Zamak decided . " I would rather live alone than let my last child be swallowed up by this evil . Besides , the D'Medveds will be back looking for her , once they find their count is dead . " D'Cey agreed there seemed to be no other choice . " Will you take her ? " Lady Ukhova asked . " To where ? " D'Cey could not picture himself returning to Paris , landless and penniless , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . Nor was he . He had not planned to return at all not until he had made his fortune . " To Kazakistan . My cousins there will know what to do - being shamans and shape-changers themselves . They might even have a cure for her . Lady Oghul will go with you - to speak for you , and show the way . " D'Cey bowed low , " As you wish . " He had small desire to head off into the dawn in search of Lady Ukhova 's wandering relations - but he still less wanted to wait in Kara Zamak for the devil-cat to recover and the D'Medveds to return in force . Klara was even more reluctant , but after a tearful interview with her mother agreed to go - there truly being naught else to do . Soon she was showing a child 's resilience , going through Black Castle , collecting things to take ; her velvet dress and pearl spray comb , a prized pony , her favorite fetishes , and the little ragged dog . They left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazaks escorting Aunt Ghul 's yurt , and a small herd of cattle and remounts . Skirting the Iron Wood , they headed south toward the caravan route , the Silk Road that ran all the way to Far Cathay . D'Cey turned in the saddle for a final look at the dark stone castle rearing over the steppe , with cold iron trees crowding against its walls . He wondered how long it would take for the Iron Wood to swallow Kara Zamak completely .
