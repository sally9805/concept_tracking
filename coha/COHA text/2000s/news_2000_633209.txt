<p> The mayor of any municipality has an obligation and responsibility to provide services ( snow plowing , street maintenance , police protection , etc. ) for residents and businesses . In order to pay for those services , we have to receive revenues from various sources . The bottom line is , they come from you and me , the taxpayers . <p> I see a problem that all municipal leaders must face . Congress imposed a three-year moratorium on taxes on Internet sales in October 1998 . Congress was feeling very generous to give Internet sellers three years of wait and see . Meanwhile , we have to deal with reality : The more people who buy goods over the Internet , the fewer sales we have in our local businesses ; and the less in sales taxes we collect to run city services . <p> Palos Heights depends on 20 percent of its revenue from sales taxes . Oak Brook depends on 100 percent of its revenue from sales taxes to run its government and services . This moratorium will do great damage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard is : " It would be so complicated to figure out how much sales tax each municipality and state should receive . " Well , the very same computer that takes Internet sales is the same computer that can figure out the local taxes that should be paid to each government entity . <p> Some legislators are worried that relatively young Internet companies will have their growth stunted if they have to collect sales taxes . The same concern is there among local entrepreneurs . How are we going to talk about world trade if we can not be fair with our own Main Street America merchants ? <p> The time is now for Congress to take action  --  not in the two years left of the moratorium , because in two more years Internet sellers will be in an entrenched position to tell Congress what to do . Internet sales are leapfrogging while our local merchants are losing , and our municipalities will have to raise revenue by some other means . That is not a pleasant task for any mayor or municipal leader . <p> In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are saving what they do not pay in sales taxes over the Internet . If Congress continues to allow Internet sales to be tax-free , it would create devastating economic and social problems . <p> Mayor Dean Koldenhoven , <p> Palos Heights <p> From whence I came <p> I emphatically disagree with Dennis Byrne ( column , Jan. 5 ) . I am a birth mother who was raped . The stigma of unwed pregnancy in 1969 prevented my family or social services from helping me keep my baby . Relinquishment was not my first choice . The only promise made the day I signed the relinquishment was to myself , that I would find my baby someday . <p> After 19 years , I did find my daughter . It was important to me that she know how much I love her and have thought about her over the years , and I believe it is her right to know the truth . I know of several birth mothers who when first contacted by their child were hesitant to tell other children . After much time and thought , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> The adoption reform movement has struggled since the 1950s to shed light on the real issues and lifelong process of adoption for adoptees , birth parents and adoptive parents . It is society 's judgment about the " bad " unwed mother that has kept some birth mothers in the closet . It is time for society to correct its perception of single mothers and give adult adoptees their civil rights : free access to their original birth certificates . Shame on Byrne for making a mockery of the rights of adult adoptees and the voters of Oregon . <p> Sheila Ganz , <p> San Francisco <p> Towering infernal <p> I was fascinated by the comments made by various parties regarding the proposed 50-story building at 600 N. Lake Shore ( financial story , Jan. 6 ) . <p> Given the uproar and outrage expressed within the last year over the proposed redevelopment of a nearby site , 850 N. Lake Shore , where more than 2,000 signatures were collected in opposition to the project , it 's interesting to see which city officials received the message and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development , is to be commended for voicing concern about the scale and density of the 600 N. Lake Shore project  --  especially since Hill was formerly a project architect and construction manager for the firm selected to design the high-rise . <p> Predictably , our elected representative , Ald. Burton Natarus ( 42nd ) , is for the umpteenth time not concerned one iota about the negative ramifications of yet another high-rise . He again is squarely in the developer 's court . Natarus ' duplicitous comments sound like those of a developer 's attorney , not those of a constituent 's advocate and representative . <p> This is one more indicator that the planning process in Chicago needs to be restructured . We need to begin assessing the sum impact of all of the downtown high-rises  --  those under construction and those proposed  --  and not simply approve them one by one . By continuing to approve these behemoth projects on a piecemeal basis , we are endangering quality of life . <p> High-rise buildings exacerbate traffic congestion , eliminate sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be standing long after the officials who approve them have retired or moved on . Who will preside over the chaos and mayhem that is inevitable when one high-rise after another is approved ? <p> Anna Weaver , <p> Near North Side <p> Christmas every day <p> Molly Ivins ' column ( Jan. 7 ) slobbering over Bill Bradley was enough to make me retch . Could anyone be more biased toward politicians who play Robin Hood by taxing hardworking people and giving it to people who prefer not to work , save or have any control over their own lives ? <p> Think about it : We have federal income taxes , state income taxes , real estate taxes , sales taxes , excise taxes , transfer taxes , unemployment taxes , to name a few . Bradley is just another blood-sucking politician who wants to play Santa Claus . <p> Herb Hupfer , Deer Park <p> Friends in high places <p> Mayor Daley tells us he did n't know that millions in city contracts were dishonestly approved for special political cronies who donate to his campaigns . Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were corrupt and taking bribes at state license bureaus while giving the money to him for his campaigns . Senate President James " Pate " Philip decrees himself the No. 1 gun lover in Illinois and defeats the Safe Neighborhoods Act designed to lock up criminals . The " Wirtz family liquor law , " backed by Ryan , produces colossal profits for a select few liquor distributors . Each and every one of these special-interest political dealings comes at the expense of the people . <p> If all power is trust , the people 's greatest weakness is that they do n't realize their own combined strength . When do the people say stop  --  no longer will we take this from the politicians ? <p> Jerry Wilkerson , Crete <p> An attention deficit <p> Mary A. Mitchell 's column ( Jan. 4 ) again points out how enamored she is of the Rev. Jesse Jackson , as is the Sun-Times and a majority of its writers . It makes a person sick that you hardly ever publish any opposition to these fractured opinions . <p> She writes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in Decatur should have gotten the same media coverage afforded to Jackson 's protest march in November . I agree  --  this lack of media coverage will break Jackson 's heart , and this frustration might result in less of his rabble-rousing . <p> Ray Bradley , Burbank <p> We 'll take it in cash <p> News item : United States to pay $ 28 million to China for its bombing of the Chinese Embassy during the NATO campaign in Kosovo , minus $ 3 million for damage done to the U.S. Embassy in China by protesters during orchestrated demonstrations . <p> How about yet another deduction to reimburse us for China 's unwelcome gift of the Asian long-horned beetle , defense against which already has cost millions to destroy infested trees , with no end in sight ? Washington could simply send the funds to the affected communities . <p> Ted Z. Manuel , Hyde Park <p> A time to mourn . . . <p> After reading the news story , Jan. 5 ) about Teamsters Local 727 picketing a funeral , it 's no wonder Donnellan Funeral Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or people would do such a thing ? Thugs would be the label I would choose . <p> Unfortunately , I am unable to use an unprintable but much more accurate vocabulary to describe such reprehensible miscreants . Shame on all of them . <p> Michael V. Timble , <p> Irving Park <p> . . . death of civility <p> Union members call non-union workers scabs and scum . We have a few words for those union Teamsters who picketed a funeral : scum of the Earth . <p> Joseph Mikos , Portage Park
