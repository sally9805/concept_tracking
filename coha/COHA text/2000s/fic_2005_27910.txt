Yonder 1 My father once asked me if I knew where yonder was . I said I thought yonder was another word for there . He smiled and said , " No , yonder is between here and there . " This little story has stayed with me for years as an example of linguistic magic : It identified a new space -- a middle region that was neither here nor there -- a place that simply did n't exist for me until it was given a name . During my father 's brief explanation of the meaning of yonder , and every time I 've thought of it since , a landscape appears in my mind : I am standing at the crest of a small hill looking down into an open valley where there is a single tree , and beyond it lies the horizon defined by a series of low mountains or hills . This dull but serviceable image returns when I think of yonder , one of those wonderful words I later discovered linguists call " shifters "  - -  words distinct from others because they are animated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can never really find yourself yonder . Once you arrive at yonder tree , it becomes here and recedes forever into that imaginary horizon . Words that wobble attract me . The fact that here and there slide and slip depending on where I am is somehow poignant , revealing both the tenuous relation between words and things and the miraculous flexibility of language . The truth is that what fascinates me is not so much being in a place as not being there : how places live in the mind once you have left them , how they are imagined before you arrive , or how they are seemingly called out of nothing to illustrate a thought or story like my tree down yonder . These mental spaces map our inner livesmore fully than any " real " map , delineating the borders of here and there that also shape what we see in the present . My private geography , like most people 's , excludes huge portions of the world . I have my own version of the famous Saul Steinberg map of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible Midwest , South , and West ; and ends in a more prominent California featuring Los Angeles . There have been only three important places in my life : Northfield , Minnesota , where I was born and grew up with my parents and three younger sisters ; Norway , birthplace of my mother and my father 's grandparents ; and New York City , where I have now lived for the past seventeen years . When I was a child , the map consisted of two regions only : Minnesota and Norway , my here and my there . And although each remained distinct from the other -- Norway was far away across the ocean and Minnesota was immediate , visible , and articulated into the thousands of subdivisions that make up everyday geography -- the two places intermingled in language . I spoke Norwegian before I spoke English . Literally my mother 's tongue , Norwegian remains for me a language of childhood , of affection , of food , and of songs . I often feel its rhythms beneath my English thoughts and prose , and sometimes its vocabulary invades both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in Northfield before I had my first birthday and lived with us for nine months ; but after she returned home , I began learning English and forgot Norwegian . It came back to me when I traveled with my mother and sister to Norway in 1959 . During those months in Norway , when I was four years old and my sister Liv was only two and a half , we forgot English . When we found ourselves back in Minnesota , we remembered English and promptly forgot Norwegian again . Although the language went dormant for us , it lived on in our house . My parents often spoke Norwegian to each other , and there were words Liv and I and Astrid and Ingrid used habitually and supposed were English words but were not . For example , the Norwegian words for bib , sausage , peeing , and butt all submerged their English equivalents . Liv and I remember using these words with friends and how surprised we were to see their befuddled faces . The paraphernalia of infancy , of food , and inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother that they existed only in Norwegian . When I was twelve , my father , a professor of Norwegian language and literature , took a sabbatical year in Bergen , and Norwegian came back to me in a kind of flash . After that , it stuck . The speed with which we four sisters transferred our lives into Norwegian is nothing short of remarkable . During that year we played , thought , and dreamed in Norwegian . I returned to Norway in 1972 and attended gymnasium in Bergen for a year . That time my family was not with me . I lived with my aunt and uncle outside the city and took the bus to school . Sometime during the initial weeks of my stay , I had a dream . I can not remember its content , but the dream took place in Norwegian with English subtitles . I will always think of that dream as limbo . Its cinematic code expressed precisely my place between two cultures and two languages . But soon the metaphorical subtitles of my life disappeared , and I immersed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now been twenty-three years since I really lived in Norwegian . It surprises even me that less than three of my forty years were actually spent in Norway and that nearly every minute of that time was lived in Bergen . I speak Norwegian with such a broad Bergen dialect that my parents find it comical . That dialect is the real legacy of my years in Bergen , the imprint of an experience that will not leave me . Chances are even senility wo n't rob me of it , since the old and feebleminded often return to the language of early childhood . And yet Norwegian survives in me not only as a sign of Bergen but as a sign of my parents ' house in Minnesota . It is not for nothing , after all , that when my stepson , Daniel , was a very little boy and he looked forward to going home to Minnesota with me and his father for Christmas , he would ask , " When are we going to Norway ? " If language is the most profound feature of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my childhood history of forgetting and remembering enacts in miniature the dialectic of all immigrant experience : here and there are in a relation of constant strain that is chiefly determined by memory . My father , who is a third-generation Norwegian , speaks English with a Norwegian accent , testament to an American childhood that was lived largely in Norwegian . Although separated by an ocean , my mother and father grew up speaking the same language .
