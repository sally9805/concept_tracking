Chapter One " ... naked , naked ... I do n't have any clothes ... so so cold ... " " Who is this ? " I asked . " So cold , " the voice said again . " Who is this ? " " ... cold and naked . Sleeping in the trees . " He hung up then . It was the fourth evening in a week that he 'd called . The first night he only grunted and moaned . Two days later , he spoke in single words . Those words were cold and naked . The voice was definitely masculine but strained and frightened . The next night he used the same two words , but he doubled up on them from time to time , saying , naked , cold , cold , naked . He was pleading , but I did n't know what he wanted . He did n't seem threatening , just desperate and crazed . When I told Nella about it , she said that I should call the police . " There 's no telling what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buttercream-colored , dreadlock-wearing ceramicist warned . " He might be working up to coming in there and slaughtering you and everybody in your whole house . " " He does n't even know my name , " I said . " He knows your number , " the lovely young Jamaican reasoned . " He probably dialed it once , and now it 's on his redial or something . " " Better be safe , " Nella said , " than dead . " I was n't worried about a few crank calls . In my head , I had worked outthat the poor guy was already in a mental institution . That he was on the honor plan or something like that . At night he got confused and hallucinated that he was naked and cold , living in the woods . That 's how it was with my grandmother before she died . During the day she was perfectly lucid , talking about old times in Atlanta before she and my grandfather moved to Los Angeles . She had all kinds of great stories about her wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married , about her friends in the church choir . She was also a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . " Back then Martin Luther King stood down the whole Old Boy system-and beat ' em , too , " Grandma Angeline used to say . Those talks were during the day . But after the sun set , she experienced night terrors . Her husband returned from the grave and blamed her for poisoning him . She would run away from the assisted-living home and wander Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles looking for the bus to Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta . Sometimes she bullied older male patients in the residence , taking their desserts or pushing them down when their backs were turned . For years the administrators were on the verge of moving my grandmother to a facility that offered more restrictive care . Then I would go in and talk with her about members of our family whom I 'd never met , about whom my father never spoke . There was Albert Trellmore , for instance , the bookkeeper and arsonist . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big corporations or production companies around Georgia . He loved fires and hated what big businesses did to the poor . " He burnt lumber companies , banks , loadin ' dock warehouses , and big department stores for over twenty-seven years , " my Grandma Angeline told me one gray June day . We were sitting on the first floor of the residence , near a glass wall that looked out on Pico . " He woulda kept it up for twenty-seven more if it was n't for that train-yard fire he set . " " What happened then , Grandma ? " " He did n't think that some'a the hoboes might have been sleepin ' under the depot . One of them men died , and it broke Albert 's heart . He never set another fire , and died just two years later . " " Why 'd he set those fires in the first place ? " I asked my eighty-eight-year-old gram . " White people , " she said . " Some of ' em used to refuse to hire black . Some would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now and then there was a Klansman had all his money wrapped up in one'a them places . " " But why do it on the Fourth of July ? " " Called it his patriotic duty , " she said , and we both got a big laugh out of it . After one of my visits , Grandma Angeline would calm down during the evenings . For a few weeks , we would n't get any complaints at all from the residence . I liked visiting my grandmother . My father , when he was still alive , never wanted to talk about the old days down south . He rarely visited his mother , because she insisted in talking about all that old shit , as he used to say . But I liked her stories , and I did n't care if she went crazy at night and wandered the streets of L.A. looking for Atlanta landmarks . My mother was from an Orange County WASP family that did n't have many good stories . She cooked the meals and made sure that my sister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fun-at least that 's what I thought . And so , when the crazy man who was naked and cold and living in the trees called , I had a soft spot for him like I did for my grandmother and my cousin Albert Trellmore . That night I dreamed about my father . He was emaciated , as he had been during the last months of his cancer . He had sunken black cheeks and big eyes that seemed to belong to an inquisitive infant rather than a sixty-year-old man . In his last days , he insisted on sitting up and then standing to greet me every morning when I came over to see him . He 'd always utter some word that would speak a whole volume in our personal history . " Kangol , " he said on the last morning I saw him . We both loved those hats . Actually , I did n't care much about them , but I wore one because my father had bought it for me . I made up my mind to go out and buy him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . I had to go to three different department stores before I found the right one . But when I brought it to my parents ' apartment the next morning , they were gone . Their absence could only have meant that my father had died in the night . I sat at the kitchen table until my mother returned . She told me that everything was better now because at least he was no longer in pain . In the dream , he was just as skinny and still on his deathbed . But he was flexing his muscles and sitting up against a pile of pillows . " How are you , Dad ? " " Much better , Errol . I 'm doing those exercises the nurse gave me . She said if I keep it up , I 'll beat this cancer in three months . " An elation spread through me that was so powerful I woke up rising out of the bed . I paced around the onetime garage that was now my home , hoping to find some clue to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
