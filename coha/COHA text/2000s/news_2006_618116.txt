<p> San Salvador , El Salvador  --  In all honesty , El Salvador would not have been our first choice for a long weekend out of town . On the other hand , less than 24 hours after arriving , we were plotting our return for a leisurely vacation of a week or two . <p> El Salvador seems to be inextricably linked in the American psyche with " civil war " and " death squads , " chilling words that would give pause to anyone thinking of spending a vacation here . But times have changed . This smallest of the Central American countries , while not yet the tourist magnet that Costa Rica and Guatemala have become , has much to offer the adventure traveler wanting to be among the first to explore an exciting new destination . <p> Think of Costa Rica in the 1960s , when prices were cheap , the people friendly and the atmosphere authentic . Imagine villages that seem scarcely changed for the last hundred years , their cobblestone streets lined with whitewashed adobe houses with handmade red tile roofs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into your neighbor from Alpharetta on the beaches near Quepos  --  you 'll think you have the whole country to yourself . <p> My brother and I ended up in El Salvador based on three simple facts . We speak poor but passable Spanish and enjoy traveling in Latin America . We had one particular weekend in late April when we could both be away . We did n't want to waste our limited time on long flights and airport layovers . <p> More or less by exclusion , we ended up booking a nonstop Delta flight from Atlanta to San Salvador . With a travel time of less than 3.5 hours , we reasoned that we could squeeze in an extra day of touring . <p> We spent our first night at Los Almendros de San Lorenzo , an exquisitely restored 200-year-old hacienda in the heart of the village of Suchitoto . Under the careful hand of owner Pascal Lebailly , a former Parisian , it has been transformed into a six-room inn , with gardens , a pool and a restaurant . With nightly rates of less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but an amazing value to U.S. travelers . <p> The village of Suchitoto itself is a jewel  --  " Central America as it used to be , " in Lebailly 's words . Located about 28 miles northeast of San Salvador , the capital , it 's perched high atop an escarpment that overlooks the beautiful ( but polluted ) Lago Suchitlan , a man-made reservoir for hydroelectric power . <p> During the long civil war in the 1980s and ' 90s , Suchitoto lay in the heart of rebel territory and was essentially abandoned . It is now undergoing a renaissance as an unspoiled tourist destination . The village church overlooks a cobblestone square surrounded by classic colonial architecture . Several small hotels and guesthouses are within easy walking distance . <p> San Salvador sprawls across a broad valley between the active Volcan San Salvador on one side and Lago de Ilopango , a 6-mile-wide crater lake , on the other . It 's a crowded , bustling city , founded in the early 16th century . Hotels are available in all price ranges , but they cater mainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting buildings and parks , tourists should spend their time elsewhere in the country . <p> Northwest of San Salvador , in the fertile Zapotitan Valley , are the Mayan ruins of Joya de Ceren , a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is often referred to as " the Pompeii of the Americas . " Ongoing excavations have uncovered a village buried under ash from a volcanic eruption about A.D. 640 and discovered only in 1976 . Exquisitely preserved artifacts have given archaeologists a clear view of the day-to-day life of the Mayan people near the peak of their civilization . A new museum , with detailed exhibits , puts these important findings into perspective . <p> Nearby are the ruins of San Andres , a major ceremonial complex that formed part of a Mayan regional capital more than 1,000 years ago . A series of pyramids and buildings there have been only partly excavated . More wonders , under dozens of tree-covered mounds , await the archaeologist 's trowel . <p> The western part of El Salvador is a visual feast . The landscape is dominated by the Sierra Apaneca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volcan Santa Ana , at about 7,800 feet , a raw , black cone thrust up from the earth . The rolling terrain is fertile coffee-producing country , dotted with small villages . <p> We spent the night at El Jardin de Celeste , a rustic hostel with individual cabins nestled between coffee plants high on a volcanic slope . Dozens of blooming orchids of various varieties clung to every tree and wall , breathing the moist mountain air . We hitchhiked into the tiny settlement of Concepcion de Ataco , where a late-evening snack of beer and pupusas set us back a couple of dollars . ( Pupusas are a staple food in El Salvador , made of corn and water , similar to a Mexican tortilla but thicker . ) <p> On Sunday afternoon , we hit the twice-weekly food festival at nearby Juayua , mixing with locals out for an afternoon of music and relaxation . Hundreds of vendors ' stalls serving everything from conejo ( rabbit ) to cangrejo ( crab ) lined the streets . Old couples danced to distinctly modern music while onlookers sipped chicha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign tourists in sight , we felt as if we 'd walked into the filming of a travelogue . <p> For our last night in El Salvador , we stayed at the beachfront Hotel Pacific Paradise on the Costa del Sol , southeast of San Salvador . Our guide said it was " very deluxe , " and , indeed , the brochure described it as " Your Paradise on the Pacific : An Unforgettable Experience . " Visually it was impressive , albeit reminiscent of the Buccaneer Motor Inn on Jekyll Island in the mid-1960s . Palm-tree-shaded cabanas and lush green lawns fronted on a wide volcanic sand beach . <p> The amenities , however , were less than perfect . The single taps in the sink and shower produced only cold water . The generator that powered the hotel blinked on and off . We read the widely posted signs detailing what to do in case of an earthquake , but fortunately never had to heed the instructions . <p> As a vacation destination , El Salvador is not for the average American . The country is sorely lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accommodation standards may be disappointing . As in many Third World countries , poverty is a problem , and basic government services are often overwhelmed by a growing population . <p> On the other hand , the people are friendly and hardworking , the cost of travel is relatively cheap , and it 's a quick direct flight from Atlanta . My brother and I enjoyed ourselves immensely , and we would not hesitate to take our families back for a long stay in one of the smaller mountain towns . <p> The Salvadoran government is aware of the challenges it faces in attracting tourism . I suspect that , within a decade or two , El Salvador will become a regular retreat for Americans seeking respite in the sun . Until that happens , I 'll be going back again and again . <p> William Rawlings of Sandersville is a physician and author .

Expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees . <p> When to go <p> The best months are from November to March , when the weather can be expected to be clear and dry . The rainy season lasts from May to October , and travel may be impossible then in some rural areas . <p> Getting around <p> There is an excellent system of local buses , with taxicabs in the larger towns . Rental cars are available at rates more or less comparable with the United States . ( During the rainy season , consider a four-wheel-drive vehicle . ) Unless you 're fluent in Spanish , however , you 'd be far better served to hire a guide and/or driver . <p> Where to stay <p> * In Suchitoto : Los Almendros de San Lorenzo ( www.hotelsalvador.com ) ; La Posada de Suchitlan ( www.laposada.com.sv ) <p> * In Joya de Ceren : Magazine article on El Jardin de Celeste ( in Spanish with photos ) : **54;3949;TOOLONG <p> Money and costs <p> The U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency of El Salvador in 2001 .
