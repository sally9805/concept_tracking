Pulling no punches in a new memoir , Robin Givens recounts the cycle of abuse in her family , her violent marriage to Mike Tyson  --  and how she found peace in being a mom . " If you 're a person on this earth , " actress Robin Givens says , " there 's no way you 're not going to go through a difficult time . " She would know : In 1988 , at 23 , the star of the ' ' 80s sitcom Head of the Class married boxer Mike Tyson . Less than a year later she filed for divorce amid allegations that he had physically abused her  --  and she was quickly branded a " gold digger " and the " Most Hated Woman in America " in the press . But as Givens reveals in her emotional new memoir , Grace Will Lead Me Home , by leaning on her faith ( and ex-boyfriend Brad Pitt ) , she was able to " start dreaming forward instead of backward . " Now starring on MyNetworkTV 's Saints &; Sinners , Givens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she adopted in 1993 , and Billy , 7 , her child with ex-boyfriend Murphy Jensen , in Florida and New York City , where she chatted with PEOPLE . It 's been almost 20 years since your divorce . Why write a book now ? It was n't until I was beyond it that I started feeling all of the pain . Some people go to therapy ; for me , writing was therapeutic . I just had to get whatever was in me out . What do n't people know about you and Mike ? He was just ... my friend . I could go to bed with Clearasil all over my face and he thought that was cute because it was me . I think having that first man that tells you you 're worthy of being loved is a critical thing . Yet in the book you detail physical abuse and say that he sexually assaulted you during a trip to Russia in ' ' 88 . I do n't want to minimize what happened , but I never said , " Oh , Michael raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an abusive relationship ; that was just another experience of being powerless . A spokesman for Tyson had no comment . Why did you stay as long as you did ? I wanted to be the person that navigated him to happily ever after . I grew up on musicals , so I 'm waiting for somebody to break into song and everything will be good in the end . I just got in over my head . You mention that your mother and grandmother also suffered from physical abuse . Nobody talked about certain things that had happened . So my take is that you have to talk about things , to look your demons in the eye and say , " You do n't have a hold on me . Let 's move on . " Brad Pitt was apparently a big part of your healing process . We dated for about six months after the split with Tyson . It was nice . He was really just so gentle and so understanding  --  he would say , " Baby , it 's okay . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen him or talked to him since . What else got you through ? I grew up Catholic , but in that time of being alone , that sense of not wanting to go on , is really where I found comfort in a higher power . Believing and having faith is the way I survive . Are you and Mike still in touch ? I saw him over a year ago at a premiere . We hugged , and he said , " I 'm sorry . " And I said , " I love you , " and he said , " I love you . " We loved each other once  --  I ca n't negate that . He has a place in my heart , but he 's really not a part of my life . How do you feel looking back on it all ? I was a baby then . And there was so much criticism of me . I was in a gift shop and people were talking about Britney Spears shaving her head , and I said , " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the world and grow up . What makes you happy now ? I ca n't tell you how much I enjoy my children . Our house is a mess , I 'm yelling constantly  --  but it feels good . Do n't get me wrong , I want a 6 ' ' 2 " man too ! I 'm dating now , but I would love to find something serious . We 'll see what happens . BOX " I feel like , " Wow  --  What 's in store for me now ?
