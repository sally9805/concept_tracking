Chapter One " YOU REALLY WANT ME to kill him ? " The question hung in the air for a moment , and neither said another word . The flames crackled in the fireplace of the elegant penthouse apartment overlooking central Tehran . Light rain fell on the clay balcony tiles . Bitter December winds howled outside , rustling trees and rattling windows . Thunder rumbled in the distance . And the room and the sky grew dark . Mohammed Jibril looked out over the teeming city of his youth , as the haunting call to prayer echoed across the rooftops . He knew he should not feel so tired , but he did . Tired of sleeping in different beds , different houses , different cities . Tired of constantly watching his back , and that of Yuri Gogolov , the man sitting in the shadows behind him , puffing casually on one of his beloved Cuban cigars . Jibril considered his options . There were n't many . " You understand , of course , " Jibril continued , " that you will be unleashing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A silent , unnerving pause . " And you 're ready for this war ? " Jibril asked , perhaps too bluntly . Instantly regretting the question , he could feel a chill descend upon the room . Gogolov sat motionless in an overstuffed velvet chair . He looked out at the mountainsand the minarets and the twinkling lights of the ancient Iranian capital . He drew long and hard on the Cohiba , and the cigar glowed in the shadows . * * * Air Force One roared down runway 18-36 " Lima . " Flanked by four F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jets , the gleaming new Boeing 747 quickly gained altitude and banked toward the Atlantic . President James " Mac " MacPherson stared out the window . He could no longer see the lights of Madrid Barajas International Airport , or the lights of the Spanish capital itself , just nine miles away . The emergency one-day NATO summit was over . In a few hours , he 'd be home , back at the White House , under pressure to answer the question on everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Al-Qaeda and the Taliban were obliterated . And now-just three and a half weeks after it began-the war in Iraq was effectively over . Saddam Hussein was dead and buried under a thousand tons of rubble . His sons were dead too . His murderous regime had been toppled . His henchmen were being scooped up by U.S. Special Forces , one by one , day by day . But the president had never felt more alone . Rebuilding Iraq and keeping it from blowing apart like Bosnia would be difficult enough . But that was n't the only thing on his plate . Wars and rumors of wars dominated the headlines . New threats surfaced constantly . North Korea was just months away from building six to ten nuclear bombs . Iran would soon complete a nuclear reactor with Russian assistance , capable of producing two to three nuclear warheads a month . Syria and Iran appeared to be harboring top Iraqi military officials and scientists . NATO was badly divided . The U.N . was a mess . Democrats threatened to filibuster most of the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI and Justice Department were recommending the death penalty in United States v. Stuart Morris Iverson , one of the most chilling acts of espionage in the nation 's history , not to mention one that involved one of the president 's closest friends and a man who had been , until a month ago , secretary of the treasury . Saudi Arabia , meanwhile , was insisting that all U.S. forces leave its soil immediately . And OPEC-outraged by the U.S. strikes against Iraq-was threatening an all-out oil embargo unless war reparations were made to the Iraqi people and pressure was brought to bear on Israel to allow the creation of a Palestinian state . The president recoiled at the thought of an ultimatum from countries he had just saved from nuclear , chemical , and biological annihilation . He was n't about to submit to blackmail , but he was painfully aware of the risks he was running . Even now , his handpicked diplomatic team was on its way to Jerusalem . MacPherson-feeling quite vigorous at sixty until a team of Iraqi assassins nearly took his life the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of aspirin and washed it down with a bottle of water . His head was pounding . His back and neck were in excruciating pain . He needed sleep . He needed to clear his head . The last thing he needed was an oil price shock reminiscent of ' 73 . So much of the road ahead was foggy . But one thing was painfully obvious : the horrific battle of Iraq was n't the end of the war on terror . It was just the beginning . * * * When ordering a hit , Jibril preferred the anonymity of an Internet caf . No one would bother him . No one could trace him . And at less than twenty-five thousand rials an hour-about three U.S. dollars-it was far cheaper than using his satellite phone . Tehran alone boasted more than fifteen hundred cyber shops , which had exploded in popularity ever since Mohammad Khatami was elected president in 1997 and gave the fledgling Internet sector his blessing . The hard-line religious clerics continued to be wary . In 2001 , they 'd forced four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licenses , breaking Islamic laws , and trafficking in " Western pollution . " They 'd insisted that the government deny anyone under the age of eighteen from entering the shops . But that just made the idea of an electronic periscope into the West all the more alluring , and Web traffic shot up faster than ever . The bulletproof sedan eased off the main boulevard . Mohammed Jibril told his driver to drop him off at the Caspian Cyber Caf on Enghelab Avenue , across from the University of Tehran . A moment later he logged on and sent a half dozen cryptic e-mails . Next , he pulled up the home page for Harrods of London and quickly found what he needed . Harrods Chocolate Batons with French Brandy-twelve individually wrapped milk-chocolate batons filled with Harrods Fine Old French Brandy . Made from the finest Swiss chocolate . 100g . He hit the Buy Now button , typed in the appropriate FedEx shipping information , paid with a stolen credit card , and left as quickly as he came . Now all he could do was wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The eyes of the world were now on Jon Bennett . A senior advisor to the president of the United States , Bennett was the chief architect of the administration 's new Arab-Israeli peace plan . The front-page , top-of-the-fold New York Times profile the day before-Sunday , December 26-had just dubbed him the new " point man for peace . " The media was now tracking his every move and the stakes could n't be higher . The president was eager to shift the world 's attention from war to peace , to rebuilding Iraq and expanding free markets and free elections in the Middle East . The Pentagon and CIA insisted the next battles lay in Syria and Iran . But the State Department and White House political team argued such moves would be a mistake . It was time to force the Israelis and Palestinians to the bargaining table , to nail down a peace treaty the way Jimmy Carter had with Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat at Camp David in ' 77 , and the way Clinton had tried to with Barak and Arafat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they reminded the president . And the president was listening . Bennett was n't so sure it was the right time , or that he was the right man . He had n't asked to be named " point man for peace . " He had n't wanted the job . But the president insisted . He needed a deal , he needed it now , and Bennett could n't say no . At forty , Jonathan Meyers Bennett was one of the youngest and most successful deal makers on Wall Street , and a guy who had everything . An undergraduate degree from Georgetown . An MBA from Harvard . A thirty-eighth-floor office overlooking Central Park . A forest green Jaguar XJR , for business . A red Porsche Turbo , for pleasure . A seven-figure salary , with options and bonuses . A seven-figure portfolio and retirement fund . A $1.5 million penthouse apartment in Greenwich Village near NYU , for which he 'd paid cash . Closets full of Zegna suits . And Matt Damon good looks . Few people on Wall Street knew much about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the women in his office . Six feet tall with short dark hair and grayish green eyes , he had a picture-perfect smile after a fortune in dental work as a kid . He 'd once been voted the office 's most eligible bachelor , but only part of that was true . He was a bachelor , but not all that eligible . He dated occasionally , but all his colleagues knew Bennett was married to his work , pure and simple . He typically worked twelve to fourteen hours a day , including Saturdays . None of that had changed at the White House , and now he was at his desk by ten-thirty on Sundays , too , watching Meet the Press and planning for the week ahead . Before coming to Washington , Bennett had been the senior VP and chief investment strategist for Global Strategix , Inc. , one of the hottest firms on the Street . Part strategic-research shop , part venture-capital fund , GSX advised mutual and pension funds , as well as the Joshua Fund , which had $137 billion in assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the financial industry 's " AWACS " - its airborne warning and control system-able to alert money managers of trouble long before it arrived . GSX also had a reputation of finding " sure things , " early investments in start-up ventures that hit the jackpot and paid off big . Most of the credit went to Bennett . He had a sixth sense for finding buried treasure , and he loved the hunt . The plaque on his desk said it all : " I 'm not the richest man in the richest city in the richest country on the face of the globe in the history of mankind . But tomorrow is another day . " Then " tomorrow " threw him a curveball . Suddenly he was off the Street , out of GSX , working for the White House , and on the secretary of state 's 757 , headed for the Holy Land . It was surreal , to say the least , but the package came with one big incentive : the chance to cut a deal they 'd be writing about for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey there , Point Man ; we there yet ? " Erin McCoy rubbed the sleep from her eyes . She put her seat back in its upright position and prepared for landing . A senior member of Bennett 's team for the past several years , she 'd been teasing him about the Times profile for the last twenty-four hours , and enjoying every minute of it . After takeoff from Andrews , she 'd persuaded the pilot to welcome the entire American delegation , including " our own Jon Bennett , the esteemed point man for peace . " She 'd even plastered the interior of the plane with big red , white , and blue signs asking , " What 's the point , man ? " " You kill me , McCoy . " " Do n't tempt me , Jon . " She smiled . Bennett stared back out the window , trying to ignore how good McCoy looked in her ivory silk blouse and black wool suit . She really was beautiful , he thought . Why had n't she become a model instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut brown hair , lightly tanned skin , sparkling green eyes , and a picture-perfect smile that had n't required any dental work at all . All that , and she was ranked an expert marksman with six different kinds of weapons , including her favorite , a 9 mm Beretta , which she carried with her at all times . How could this girl still be single ? " Just give me a copy of the schedule , would you ? " Bennett asked . " You got it , " said McCoy as she pulled out a few pages from her briefing book . " Point Man touches down at 0700 local time , Monday , December 27th ; meets with the Palestinians , then the Israelis ; saves the world ; spends New Year 's in Cancn ; then cuts large check to beautiful deputy for saving his life , and his job . " Bennett fought hard not to give her the satisfaction of a smile . But it was n't easy . " I do n't know what I 'd do without you , McCoy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But believe me , I 'll think of something . " * * * The webmaster in London instantly recognized the e-mail address . This was no order for chocolate . And she knew it was urgent . She quickly e-mailed a copy to Harrods ' shipping clerk downstairs for immediate processing , then logged on to AOL and IM 'd a gift shop on the Rock of Gibraltar . * * * Thirty minutes later , they sped along Highway 1 toward Jerusalem . Through driving rains . Past huge green road signs in Hebrew , Arabic , and English . Past the rusted shells of armored personnel carriers destroyed in the 1948 war . Past roads that would lead them , if they wanted , a few miles and a few thousand years away to ancient biblical towns like Jaffa and Bethlehem and Jericho . Two blue-and-white Israeli police cars led the way . Two more brought up the rear . In between were a jet-black Lincoln Town Car carrying the advance team from the embassy , two bulletproof Cadillac limousines , two black Chevy Suburbans carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diplomatic Security , and four vans of reporters who would beam the historic words and images to a global audience desperate for some good news from the war-torn Middle East . The first limousine-code-named Globe Trotter-carried the secretary of state and his aides . Bennett and McCoy rode in the second limo-code-named Snapshot-joined by two old friends upon whose wisdom they now greatly counted . The first was Dmitri Galishnikov , the hard-charging CEO of Medexco , Israel 's fastest-growing oil-and-gas company . The second was Dr. Ibrahim Sa'id , the soft-spoken , Harvard-educated chairman of PPG , the Palestinian Petroleum Group , which had made a fortune in the Gulf and now had everyone in the West Bank and Gaza buzzing with excitement . " Miss Erin , I must say , you look like an angel-like my wife on our wedding day , " Galishnikov boomed . " As for you , Point Man , you look terrible . " That got a laugh from everyone , even Bennett . " Seriously , how are you feeling , Jonathan ? " Sa'id asked . " We were worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less here . " It was a miracle . The last time they 'd been together , they 'd been under attack by Iraqi terrorists . Bennett took two AK-47 rounds at point-blank range . He 'd practically bled to death before being airlifted to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany . Three weeks of recovery and rehab later , he was still not 100 percent . " Good days and bad , you know . " Bennett shrugged . " But it 's good to see you two again . " " You too , my friend , " Sa'id agreed . " And your mother ? How is she ? " McCoy watched Bennett shift uncomfortably . " Well , she 's not exactly thrilled about me coming back , that 's for sure . Dad 's heart attack , the funeral , what happened to me-she 's been through a lot . But she 's hanging in there . I 'll head down to Orlando to see her for a few days when we get back . " " That 's good . " Sa'id smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bennett was n't so sure about that , but he said nothing . * * * An e-mail arrived in a small gift shop on Gibraltar . It was quickly forwarded to a wood-carving shop in Gaza . Soon it drew the attention of an immaculately well-dressed young man by the name of Khalid al-Rashid . To anyone but him , the message would mean nothing , just an old family relative sending greetings for the holidays . But to the third most powerful man in Palestine , it could mean only one thing : his date with destiny had arrived . * * * The motorcade began to climb the foothills leading to Jerusalem . Tonight , the U.S. delegation would take up two entire floors of the King David Hotel , overlooking Mount Zion , the stone walls of the Old City , and the Mount of Olives just beyond them . Tomorrow they 'd have a long working lunch with Israeli prime minister David Doron . But soon they would actually be sitting in Gaza City , overlooking the stormy Mediterranean , drinking coffee and eating baklava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-haired successor , Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas , better known by his nom de guerre , Abu Mazen . It would be a long day . Diplomatic formalities and endless pleasantries would likely take until lunch . They 'd eat lentil soup and lamb until they could n't stuff down another scrap of pita . Then they 'd get down to business . ( Continues ... )
