<p> The Internet is a wonderful invention . ( Thanks , Vice President Gore . ) But it has taken rumormongering to a new level . <p> In this case , it 's the recirculation of stale Joe Sakic-to-Vancouver rumors . If they came on a milk carton , it would have stunk out not just the refrigerator but the entire house . <p> Somebody throws it out . It gets picked up in a ' notes column . ' It gets tossed out by a talk-show host . It gets thrown into another notes column 2,000 miles ( but only one Web browser ) away . By the time it gets back around the cycle , even the gossip who started it thinks it 's genuine stuff . <p> All right , I mentioned the Sakic rumor . But I mentioned it because <p> ( Time out . You are now hearing old music . Does n't the Orlando Symphony do a nice cover of ' In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida ' ? ) <p> Time in : That break was for the 27th phone call I 've gotten from someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sakic talk ? ' <p> Not at this time . <p> Avs general manager Pierre Lacroix again will have to tackle the game he seems to enjoy more than any other executive in sports because of his background as a sports agent . And that 's continuing to retool on the fly , making the most of finite payroll resources in a game of skyrocketing salaries . <p> So , yes , in the tradition of Mike Ricci , Chris Simon and Claude Lemieux , and even of Theo Fleury , the Avs probably will have to jettison more popular players in the next few months . <p> But it almost certainly wo n't be Sakic , Peter Forsberg or Adam Foote . It probably wo n't be Sandis Ozolinsh or Patrick Roy , either . Or any of the ' kids . ' <p> First , Sakic . Yes , he will be a restricted free agent again after this season . Yet no matter what , the Avs ca n't lose him for nothing . What 's more , they are only paying Sakic a ' bargain ' $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million upfront payment Ascent made to him under the terms of the offer sheet he signed with the Rangers three years ago . Trade him now ? For what ? Draft choices - which the Avs would get if he signs with another team next summer , and they do n't match , anyway ? That would be a great message for Ascent to send to fans or a prospective buyer . It makes neither competitive nor economic sense . <p> Trade him next summer to the Canucks , so he can center the prized Sedin twins in his hometown ? For one thing , Henrik Sedin is a center and would have to slide over to wing to make room for Sakic . <p> The whole thing is silly . For now . If the ownership mess takes turns for the worse , or if a new ownership stupidly tells Lacroix slash for next season , yes , a Sakic trade could happen - or he could be allowed to leave . <p> But do n't bet on it . <p> The other two rumors floating around of late have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ozolinsh because he also will be a restricted free agent and his agent , Paul Theofanous , has a contentious relationship with Lacroix . <p> The Avs acquired Ozolinsh four years ago because they needed an offensive defenseman , and they still do . Martin Skoula is a long way from filling that role , if he ever can . Also , this talk of trading Ozolinsh for a hard-nosed defenseman ignores two realities : That would leave that offensive void , and NOBODY will trade the Avs the elite , mean-streak defenseman who would at least make the deal defensible . <p> Finally , is winger Adam Deadmarsh , who also could be a restricted free agent and has been mercurial , on the market ? This one makes some sense , although Lacroix sniffs at the charge that he would tell coach Bob Hartley to demote Deadmarsh to see who might fit in at his spot on the first line . Keep in mind that if you want to get a lot for Deadmarsh , do n't you want him to score ? Or would Lacroix be so petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoting him , and thus justify a trade ? The thinking here is that the hunger is to win , and ordering the demotion for non-competitive reasons goes against that grain . <p> Something has to give , yes . But do n't believe everything that is being thrown at the wall . <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE <p> As expected , the conditional federal aid granted by the Canadian government to the six Canada-based NHL teams this week has gotten mixed reviews . <p> Canada has a lot of problems , both in funding education and other necessities , and it certainly is n't absurd to argue that this federal aid is a gross misordering of priorities . But the proponents point out that the game is at the very social fabric of the nation , and if more franchises flee to the United States , the loss will be felt in intangible ways . <p> The plan makes sense , since it caps the federal aid at 25 percent of what the league , the cities involved and the provinces provide . In other words , if no other entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Toronto mayor Mel Lastman , for example , is balking . <p> ' In Toronto right now , ' he said , ' there 's no money . There 's no way we could afford this . It also sets a bad precedent . It would set the pattern for the Blue Jays , Argos and Raptors . ' <p> Just when the Dallas Stars had stormed back to the top of the Pacific Division , veteran center Joe Nieuwendyk suffered a separated right shoulder at Anaheim on Wednesday night and probably will be out about four weeks . <p> The Stars still are without Derian Hatcher , Brian Skrudland and Jamie Langenbrunner , so their climb back from a terrible start has been praiseworthy . <p> ' I 'll get over this and get ready for the stretch drive , ' said Nieuwendyk , who took a clean hit from Jeff Nielsen . ' I 'm not going to throw in the towel . I want to get myself ready for another run at the Cup . ' <p> After Steve Yzerman got a goal and moved into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Calgary , a television reporter - taking a break from his day job as a rocket scientist - approached the Red Wings star . <p> By the way , the Red Wings had just lost to the Flames 6-1 . <p> ' You just reached another remarkable milestone tonight , ' said the TV chap . ' Your feelings ? ' <p> Said Yzerman : ' Well , I really do n't have any . You know , we got beat 6-1 . The goal really does n't have any significance to me right now . ' <p> Or should it be just as embarrassing to use the quote here ? <p> Patrik Elias ? Yes , the Devils ' left wing had a 12-game scoring streak after getting two goals in a victory over Chicago . His play has been one of the reasons New Jersey has vaulted to the top of the Atlantic Division and the NHL overall standings . His 18 goals on the season already had tied his career high . <p> ' Obviously , you get some confidence on a streak like that , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking my time , and the bounces are going for me . ' <p> FACEOFF <p> Those of us familiar with Marc Crawford and his infamously short temper wondered if he would have the patience and the temperament for the Vancouver Canucks ' rebuilding project . But when the Canucks got off to a strong start this season and were the most overachieving team in the league , that seemed to be a moot point . <p> Oops . Might have spoken too soon . <p> The Canucks have been awful since that fast start and Crawford , who did such a good job with the Avalanche and probably should still be coaching the team , has been showing signs of counterproductive pettiness . Their 3-3 tie with Detroit gave the Canucks a 22-45-15 record in the equivalency of a full season under Crawford . <p> He has a huge long-term contract , he has the faith and commitment from general manager Brian Burke , and - both for his own good and the good of the franchise - he needs to take a deep breath and step back every once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good team in Denver and helped get the Avs to the elite level , but embarrassing his players does n't always work . <p> Crawford reportedly questioned whether goalie Kevin Weekes - billed as the goalie of the future after he was acquired in the Pavel Bure trade - was faking or milking a minor knee injury for more than it was worth . And , voila , he was traded to the Islanders along with Bill Muckalt , another target of the Crawford ire , and Dave Scatcherd . An MRI showed no damage , the Canucks said , but two ligament tears have shown up on an MRI taken by the Islanders . <p> Crawford also has scratched early season sensation Steve Kariya of late , and the Canucks ' scoring depth has evaporated . Alex Mogilny remains out with a groin injury and the Canucks have had injury problems , but that does n't completely explain the tailspin . <p> ' If you look at our start , we 're probably good enough to be a playoff team when we 're healthy , ' Burke said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Denver area last week on a CD-release promotional tour and performed in the KBCO studio Jan. 12 . <p> He did n't make it to the Pepsi Center for an Avs game , however . <p> That 's too bad . He could have sung the national anthem . <p> The witty Zevon always has been more serious than the image presented by his most famous song - ' Werewolves of London ' - but he does n't mind . <p> When the Phoenix Coyotes arrived in Arizona , though , they adopted the howling Zevon classic as their theme song . So it was appropriate that on this tour , Zevon sang the anthem at the Coyotes-Mighty Ducks game at the America West Arena last weekend . And he talked about the lasting impact of the song . <p> ' I think I 'm lucky , ' he told the Arizona Republic . ' It 's a stupid song , but I always thought it was kind of like a dumb song for smart people . I 'd have been better off had it been , ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> Zevon also was presented a Coyotes jersey with his name on the back , and said he would wear it proudly . <p> ' I 'm from L.A. , and the Kings did n't give me a jersey , ' he said . ' The Kings never gave me squat . '
