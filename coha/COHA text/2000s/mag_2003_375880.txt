The Howard Dean Factor <P> " Dean has the courage to do good things , to restore faith to the disillusioned and the ability to make us proud to be Americans again . " DAN GALLAGHER San Diego <P> I believe Howard Dean to be just the kind of centrist we need in the White House NATION , Aug. 11 . I 'm tired of the bickering over whether a candidate is too liberal or too conservative . I 'm interested in electing a President who has a record of compromise that will permit things to get done without giving too much leverage to special interests . Dean is a fresh face with fresh ideas . He speaks his mind and his convictions . He is not afraid to be branded un-American for saying what needs to be said . JEFF ANDERSON Brattleboro , Vt . <P> Dean is a reincarnation of Eugene McCarthy . This is not the time for Democrats to do a Don Quixote routine . They need to find a real candidate who can win and enable Bush to become the next baseball commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the best choice on the issues of foreign policy , taxation , health care and the environment . But best of all , he comes on like a scrapper ! I 've had a bellyful of wimps . ARTHUR HAUPT Chicago <P> I deeply appreciated your article " The Cool Passion of Dr. Dean , " but I must correct one thing . You said I seem to regard the use of U.S. military power with " a mixture of contempt and suspicion . " I supported American military intervention in the first Gulf War and in Afghanistan , which I considered to be a matter of U.S. national security . I did not back President Bush 's attack on Iraq because I thought that the American people were not being told the truth about the reasons for invading . I do not believe any President should be given blanket authority to invade another nation unless the President sets forth clear and truthful reasons . That does not make me contemptuous of using military power ; it makes me a candidate who is more judicious in the use of U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors . HOWARD DEAN South Burlington , Vt . <P> You overestimated the importance of Dean 's opposition to the Iraq war . Dean 's support is n't made up only of the antiwar left . He appeals to voters because he challenges the cowardly , disastrous strategy that the Democratic Party pursued in the 2002 elections when the party 's leaders refused to fight Bush 's shortsighted , meanspirited policies . Like many Democrats , I have felt voiceless because none of the Democrats in Congress spoke for me . Dean speaks up . He does n't apologize for what he believes in . That 's why he will have my vote . DOUG MUDER Nashua , N.H. <P> You misread the Dean voter . We are not all young , white , upper-middle-class , suburban , East Coast  --  educated liberals . Some of us  --  like me  --  are black , middle-age , urban and politically pragmatic . We understand that Dean is not the flaming leftist some say he is . We support him because he did not cynically back President Bush 's Iraq-war gambit . Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tackle difficult problems and try innovative approaches to solving them . He 's not perfect , he has his rough edges , and we supporters may not agree with him on some issues . But we believe wholeheartedly that he is the right man to lead this country .
