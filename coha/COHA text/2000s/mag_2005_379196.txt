Who am I ? <P> I am a little-brother teacher , a big-girl group leader . <P> I have the wisdom of a 35-year-old and even though I do n't show it , I know you must know . <P> I 'm a caring daughter to my mother 's needs so I show I can achieve most anything . <P> Who am I ? <P> I 'm a cookie-wild girl in love with music in this world . I have a tendency to speak my mind and even though it comes out sloppy or with a slur , it 's still my words . <P> Who am I ? <P> I 'm Duresny Nemorin and that was a part of my poem , " Who Am I , " which basically describes me . I was born and raised in Miami , Fla. , by my Haitian parents Marie and Dany Nemorin . Poetry is a big part of who I am . The poets who interest me the most are Emily Dickinson , Maya Angelou , Langston Hughes and Robert Frost . I used to wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus instrument = poetry . Most of the poems I wrote at the beginning of my 7th-grade year were about my crushes , but as the school year ended I started to write about how I thought of this world . Do I want to be a poet ? I do n't know if I want to take that road in life . But poetry is what I love . <P> Another thing I love is music . Music is a big part of any 13-year-old 's life . Sometimes I ca n't live without it . Some adults say it 's a racket , but our music explains our situation in a way that we ourselves can not express . The dominant type of music I like is hip-hop , rap and R &B.; Some of my favorites are : Ludacris , Mary J. Blige , Missy Elliott , LL Cool J , Trina , Outkast and Janet Jackson . <P> Media is a big part of any 13-year-old 's life too . When I think of media , I think of the red carpet and everyone that appears there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedienne/actress Mo'Nique . I love her style , her walk and how she thinks , which is outside the box . Now if students in my school could learn from her , there would be less discrimination . See , in my school I 'm not now popular , but people know me for who I am  --  not for who I want to be . I try to keep everything equal by standing up for the geeks . I 'm not saying I never made fun of anyone , but I try to keep everything equal just like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . did . I even want to be a middle school teacher because the kids are not yet stubborn like high school students , and a teacher can still teach them what 's right and what 's wrong . <P> Other big parts of me are family , friends and religion . I am the middle child in a family with three kids . My older sister Dalourny got me into poetry , and my little brother Danley always reminds me that I 'm still a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I look like both my mom and my dad , but as the days go on I 'm acting like neither of them . I have no best friend , but I have lot of friends . If you ask them to describe me , they would say I am passionate , outrageous , crazy , friendly , annoying , hypnotic , responsible and wise . <P> So all you just read is me . I 'm a unique and original 13 because of my values and how I think . At the moment , I do n't know if I 'm ever going to change , but change is life . <P> This is one of five personal essays by 13-year-olds in this issue .
