NEW YORK  --  Stock market bottom ? Or bottomless money pit ? <p> On Nov. 20 , calls of a bottom rang out on Wall Street when investors hit the panic button , a gauge of market fear climbed to levels never seen before and stocks stopped falling after a 13-month drop of 52% . <p> But now , amid a deepening recession and after the worst week for stocks since the November swoon , the prior bear market lows that Wall Street hoped would act as a final price floor are in jeopardy . <p> Last week , the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average closed at a fresh bear market low . That 's prompting fear that broader market gauges such as the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 also will sink to new lows and potentially set the stage for another down leg for stocks . <p> As is often the case when stocks appear on the brink of a major breakdown , the S&amp;P 500 's rebound Friday from a big dip that brought it within 2 points of its Nov. 20 closing low of 752.44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the reprieve likely will be short-lived . The benchmark index , they say , is at risk of falling further and carving out a new lower low . <p> " One thing we know about markets is that selling begets selling , and that is the risk , " says Quincy Krosby , chief investment strategist at The Hartford . <p> Analysts that glean future market moves from stock chart patterns , investor sentiment measures and profit forecasts warn that the S&amp;P 500 could fall 15% to 20% more if the lows do n't hold . <p> Krosby says the stock market is a measure of how the nation feels about itself . <p> " The Dow is reflective of the national mood , " she says . " Right now the mood is very pessimistic and signals a negative outlook and a lack of confidence . " <p> The stock market is struggling again in 2009 , following a 38.5% loss for the S&amp;P 500 last year . The large-company index , which is tracked closely by professional investors , closed Friday at 770.05 , down 14.7% for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Oct. 9 , 2007 . <p> Investor angst is being driven by the economic fallout from the imploding housing market and weak state of the nation 's banking system . The drying up of consumer credit caused by problems at banks saddled with bad mortgage debt is creating even more downward pressure on the economy and corporate profits . <p> There is a growing belief among investors that the battered economy is n't likely to improve quickly , despite massive government intervention . Investor confidence has n't turned up despite quick moves by President Obama and Congress to stimulate the economy and forestall the growing mortgage foreclosure crisis . <p> Wall Street gave the government 's $787 billion stimulus package signed into law by Obama last week a chilly reception , arguing that it was long on so-called pork spending and short on programs that would provide a quick shot of adrenaline to a worsening economy . <p> " There was a belief that the stimulus would be enough to get things back on track , but now there are growing doubts that is the case , " says Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Heading into the year , investors were optimistic that the Obama team could come up with the right fix , but much of that hope has been dashed . Statistics from Wilshire Associates illustrate the eroding optimism : Since the original stimulus package was passed by the House on Jan. 28 , the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index has fallen 11.5% , or $1.2 trillion , and its U.S. Banks index is down 34.3% . <p> Six years to break even ? <p> Given the magnitude of the losses , some investors worry that their nest eggs have been so depleted that they wo n't be able to retire . Some wonder if they will ever again see the money they lost . <p> " I have some apprehension every time I look at my 401(k) statement , " says Grace Cooling , an engineer in Houston . " I hope the market recovers in the next 10 years . " <p> Cooling , 42 , says she has not bailed out of stocks or lost faith in the stock market but admits to stashing new money in safer but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , " is that my investments may not recover . " <p> She is not alone in her search for safety . Investors are piling into assets viewed as havens , such as short-term Treasury bills and gold , as well as cash . In mid-February , there was nearly $4 trillion parked in money market mutual funds , vs. $3.4 trillion a year ago , according to Crane Data . <p> " Several hundred billion is true cash seeking shelter , " says Peter Crane , founder of the money market-tracking firm . <p> David Hefty , CEO of Cornerstone Wealth Management , is preaching defense for now . But says many investors are likely suffering from financial paralysis . <p> " They are in the Land of Oz , " he says . " Their investment plan is closing their eyes , clicking their heels three times and hoping their portfolios go back to where they were in October 2007 . " Investors should n't expect a V-shaped recovery , nor rule out lower lows . Hefty says it will take a long time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investment Group found that the S&amp;P 500 could get back to its record high by August 2011 if the market generates annualized returns of 25% . Using more conservative projections , such as an annual return of 10% , which is the long-term average , it would take six years to earn back losses . <p> For investors exiting stocks for the safety of long-term government bonds , the break-even point is 20-plus years away . <p> Tough " years often cause investors to give up on stocks , " notes Paul Hickey of Bespoke . But , " The cost of safety certainly comes at a price . " <p> Staying fully invested in stocks also might come at a steep price . Experts say many of the conditions associated with a true market bottom are missing : <p> *Not enough fear . At market bottoms , people are scared , really scared , so scared that investors who want out of stocks , get out . As a result , a closely watched Wall Street " fear gauge , " known as the VIX , normally shoots to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that does n't come close to the fear level on Nov. 20 , when the S&amp;P 500 hit its bear market low , and the VIX topped 80 . <p> " We have n't seen a true fear spike , and that usually means there is another shoe to drop , " says Price Headley , chief analyst at BigTrends.com . <p> *Not enough bears . Too few investors have given up hope and turned bearish , which normally occurs at troughs , says Todd Salamone , senior researcher at Schaeffer 's Investment Research . <p> The number of investment newsletter writers who said they were bearish last week , for example , was well below the number of bears in November when the lows were put in . Similarly , 56.7% of investors surveyed last week by the American Association of Individual Investors said they were bearish  --  nearly double the long-term average . However , that was still fewer than the bears present at the panic lows hit in October and November 2008 , and in March 2008 , when JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The mentality is , we 're down 50% , how much lower can we go ? " Salamone says . " If the lows get taken out , those types of investors are potential sellers . " <p> *Not enough good economic news . Stocks historically turn up before the economy . But that has n't occurred yet because the economic data , ranging from home sales and job losses to retail sales and factory orders , keep getting worse . That is forcing economists such as David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch to continue to lower 2009 and 2010 profit projections for U.S. companies . Stocks are not going to shoot higher until there are signs that the economy is getting better . And that will depend on how successful Obama 's stimulus plan is in jump-starting the economy . <p> Another big wild card : how effective the bank rescue plan , details yet to come , will be in restoring confidence in banks and getting credit flowing . <p> Buying opportunities <p> So how low is low ? Rosenberg sees the S&amp;P 500 bottoming at 666 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , laid out in a recent report , is based on a combination of a dour earnings outlook for 2009 and historical data that show the S&amp;P 500 tends to trough during recessions when the market is trading at 12 times the earnings projection one year out . <p> Do n't rule out 600 on the S&amp;P 500 , says Kevin Lane at FusionIQ . He stresses that buyers have come in on many occasions since 1997 to provide support for the S&amp;P 500 at around the 740-to-780 range . The 740 level held in November , as well as three times during the 2002 bear market . " The next stop on a violation of 740 would be the 600 level , " Lane notes . <p> If that occurs , " It will present one of the best buying opportunities in a long time , " says Bruce Bittles , chief investment strategist at R.W. Baird . <p> Adds Ablin , " 752 on the S&amp;P is like a final line in the sand . " Only time will tell if that line gets washed away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tuesday 's <p> close : <p> 789 <p> Wednesday 's <p> close : <p> 788 <p> Thursday 's <p> close : <p> 779 <p> Friday <p> 1:17 p.m . <p> 754 <p> Friday 's <p> close : <p> 770 <p> 6.9% last week <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
