Sneakers are the all-purpose shoe : universal and utilitarian . Hardly the stuff of fetishes and exotic collections . But that 's changing . Retro collectible sneakers , until recently the domain of fashionistas and fanatical sneakerheads , are now a growing force in the athletic-shoe game . The field boasts its own websites , and exclusive , often unmarked rare-sneaker shops are popping up nationwide . These vintage kicks are even the stuff of urban art , with former pro skateboarder Chris Hall planning to display his collection this month at the Aurora Gallery in New York City . In addition , " Sneaker Pimps , " an exhibition featuring rare and limited-edition sneakers from all over the world , recently arrived from Australia for a tour of the U.S. ; it includes collections from famous pro skaters and hip-hop artists and even some borrowed from shoe-company vaults  --  including those of Nike , Vans , Puma and Converse . <P> Old-school sneaker collecting first took off in the early ' 90s as dealers bought out the leftovers of old and discontinued models from the major shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laced shoes are known as deadstock to sneaker freaks , and a particularly sought-after pair ( like original Nike Air Jordans ) can easily fetch as much as $1,000 on eBay or the sneakerhead websites . At those prices , these prized pairs stay off the feet to maintain their mint condition . <P> Taking note of this trend , the sneaker companies began dusting off their old styles and reissuing them , often in special colors and limited numbers . Adidas launched its Originals line of rereleases in 2001 . Reebok also has a classics division that re-creates ' 80s models like the Pump . <P> But for many shoe nerds , Nike rules . Since it first issued a retro Air Jordan in 1994 , Nike has consistently created some of the rarest , most coveted sneakers . In 2001 in a Sacramento , Calif. , mall , 60 police officers in riot gear faced a tense crowd of 200 people ready to battle over 80 pairs of Nike Jordan Retro XIs that were being put up for sale . This summer the most coveted shoe is the Nike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunks . Riot cops , beware . There were reportedly only 1,000 pairs made .  --  By Lisa McLaughlin
