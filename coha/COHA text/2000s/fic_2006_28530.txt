Kioto , Japan 1892 I could n't tell anyone , not even the gods , but I was scared ... really scared . Even before I got to the nunnery , I knew I had to escape . Though I respected the nuns for their piety and servitude , I wanted to be a geisha . Had to be . Did n't nuns shave their heads and their eyebrows , making their eyes bulge big and unnatural in their faces ? I held on to my long hair , vowing never to let them cut it . Even more disturbing , nuns wore plain white kimonos . White was the color of death . Why was my father taking me to a nunnery ? Why ? Was I being punished ? I did n't do anything wrong . Stroking myself until I found pleasure was n't wrong , though I was often overcome with a rising desire , a hunger that threatened to explode within me . I wanted to love and be loved . Until then , I had so much sexual energy I had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't go . Please . The world of flowers and willows is my destiny , I wanted to tell my father , no other.Did n't the geisha possess the high qualities of heart and spirit ? Did n't they inherit a compelling destiny ? Did n't Father say I was uprooted from my homeland like a beautiful flower re-planted in uncertain soil ? Did n't a geisha also leaveher home to find her destiny ? But it was not to be . " Do n't dawdle , Kathlene ! " my father whispered harshly in my ear , pulling me through the railroad station , my small suitcase banging hard against my thigh . It hurt , but I did n't complain . I 'd have a bruise on my leg by morning , but it would n't show through my white stockings . Morning.Where would I be then ? Why were we here now ? What happened to my peaceful world ? The girls ' school in Tokio run by the Women 's Foreign Missionary . What happened ? Rain pelted me in the face . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I noticed the lack of noise and scurrying all about me , as if everyone had disappeared in the mist . That was strange . Rain never stopped the Japanese from moving about the city as quickly as hungry little mice , seeing everything , nibbling at everything . They never thought of rainy days as bad-weather days , but rather a blessing from the gods because the rain kept their rice baskets full . As I plodded through the empty train station with my pointy shoes pinching my toes , wishing I were wearing my favorite clogs , with the little bells , the ones my father bought for me in Osaka , my entire body throbbed with the slow , steady beat of the ceremonial drum . No , it was more like a sexual lightning that struck me at the oddest moments . Since I 'd reached my fifteenth birthday , more and more often the hint of such pleasures came to me . When I bathed in the large cypress tub , I wiggled with delight when the warm water , smelling of citron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing me with tiny sparks of pleasure . And at night when I lay naked in my futon , the smooth silk lining rubbed against the opening between my legs , making me moist . I wished for a man who would fill me up inside so deeply the wave of pleasure would never end . I dreamed of the day I 'd feel the strength of a man 's arms around me , his muscles bulging , his hands squeezing my breasts and rubbing my nipples with the tips of his fingers . I smiled . I had the feeling the nuns would frown upon me thinking such delicious , sexy thoughts . I asked , " Where is this nunnery , Father ? " " At Jakkin Temple , not far from here . " It is n't far enough . " Why did we leave Tokio in such a hurry ? " " Do n't ask me so many questions , Kathlene , " Father said , popping up his large , black umbrella to keep the rain off us . " We 're not out of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft voice , though I was certain my father heard me . " Yes , my daughter . I could n't tell you this before , but I 've made a powerful enemy in Japan who wishes me great harm . " " Why would someone wish to harm you ? " I played with the torn finger on my glove , ripping it . I could n't help it . I was worried about my father , terribly worried . A gnawing ache told me something worse than going to a nunnery had taken place . " If you must know , Kathlene , a great tragedy has occurred , " my father said , his voice muffled by the rain . His harsh words shot through me , making me hear the pain in his voice . I dared to ask , " What do you mean ? " " A man has lost what is most dear to him and he believes I 've taken it from him . " My father looked around the railroad station , his eyes darting into every corner . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you have done " " Do n't speak about what does n't concern you , Kathlene . Something you 're too young to understand , " my father said , never looking at me , only at some hidden enemy I could n't see . He held my hand so tightly my bones felt as if they would break . " You 're hurting me , Father . Please ... " My eyes filled with tears . Not from the pain , but from the fear for my father 's safety , making my heart race . " I 'm sorry , Kathlene , " he said , loosening his grip . " I did n't mean to hurt you . " " I know , " I said in a quiet voice , but the pain in my heart remained . Father continued to look everywhere , then , satisfied the platform was empty except for the old stationmaster on duty at the wicket , he kept walking . Faster now . I forced myself to put a skip into my step as I struggled to keep up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me on the long train trip from Tokio . His head turned right then left , checking to make certain I was at his side . Even now , he dragged me behind him , wet , hungry and tired . He continued to hold on to me tightly , so tightly , as if he feared he 'd lose me . He grunted like an unhappy samurai , his head bowed low so no one would see his face . That was so unlike my father . Edward Mallory was a giant of a man , towering over everyone . He had a booming voice that carried fast and far . Here , voices were as soft as stockinged feet scurrying across wooden floors so sensitive they creaked if a nightingale landed upon them . My father was also pigheaded , stern , and he did n't understand me . How could he ? I did n't see him as often as I wished . He worked for an American bank , he was proud to tell anyone who asked , investing the bank 's money in this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father had to work hard to keep up with the competition . Every day more overseas banks were opening up branches , so he told me , and investing in the railway system spreading out over the island . He was often gone for days , meeting with officials from the Japanese government and ruling families , and drinking cup after cup of foaming green tea . Sometimes , he drank the tea with me . It tickled my mouth and made me giggle . Not my father . I doubted he ever laughed at anything . " Stay close behind me , Kathlene , " Father ordered , his voice stern . " The Prince has his devils everywhere . " " The Prince ? " My curiosity was piqued . I 'd heard my father had many meetings with the foreign minister and other dignitaries , but a prince ? My heart quickened , my eyes glowed , then dimmed when I felt my father 's body stiffen , his hand go rigid around the umbrella . " Forget what I said about the Prince , Kathlene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no time to wonder what he was talking about . My stomach jumped when I saw a young man pulling a jinrikisha , racing out of the shiny blackness of a narrow street . My father looked pleased , very pleased , to see him . So was I. Instead of wearing the cloak made of oiled paper the jinrikisha drivers wore in the rain , he was nearly nude , exposing his sinewy bronze flesh in the most delectable manner , as if he enjoyed showing off his muscular body to the rain goddesses . I imagined being a raindrop and landing upon his lips and tasting the sweetness of his kiss . I giggled . Kissing was very naughty to the Japanese , an intimacy they rarely exchanged , though I was eager to discover its pleasures . I eyed the bulging muscles on the boy 's arms , naked and pleasing to my eye , as were his powerful-looking legs . He ran barefoot with only a bit of rag tied around his big toe . What intrigued me most was the swath of dark blue cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't much bigger than the bit of rag . Most days , the station was filled with jinrikisha boys waiting for passengers , Father told me , noticing my avid interest in the young man . They were well-informed runners who knew what stranger arrived when , whose house you were passing , what plays were coming out , even when the cherry blossoms would unfold . The station was empty today except for this boy , the only one brave enough to run in the rain . He stopped in front of us and bowed low . Dusty , bare-legged coolies , I often heard the English ladies call the jinrikisha drivers . How could that be ? Not this boy . I closed my eyes , letting my mind drift through a whispering darkness . An irresistible urge rose up in me that made me yearn for something , something , but I could n't grab on to it . As if an invisible spirit with cool fingers dropped icy dewdrops upon my naked belly and made me squirm with delight . I opened my eyes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the big two-wheeled baby carriage . I craned my neck to see him better , but his face was hidden from me by a low-brim straw hat . No matter . I knew in my heart he was handsome . A bigger surprise awaited me . Without a word my father hustled me into the black-hooded conveyance . I drew in my breath , somewhat in awe . Excitement raced through me . Only geisha were allowed to ride in jinrikishas . I swore I could smell the scent of the camellia nut oil from their hair lingering on the seats . Closing my eyes and resting my head against the seat , I imagined I was a beautiful geisha . What would I do if I found a handsome young man when my frenzied sensations were at a peak , my face flushed , my breasts swollen , my nipples hard , my throat dry ? Would I lie down , raise my legs up as my lover kneels between my thighs , his hands on the straw mat ? Or would he lie on his back and stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees to his sides ? I inhaled the fresh smell of rain in the air . I found such thoughts so romantic and amusing , but I lost my smile and kept my eyes straight ahead when I saw my father staring at me . " I 'm troubled , Kathlene . Something is amiss . There 's no one here from the temple to greet us . " He rubbed his chin , thinking , then : " I have no choice but to trust this boy to take us to our destination . " " I trust him , too , Father . " I grinned when the jinrikisha boy turned around and lifted up his head from under the flat straw plate of a hat he wore and smiled at me . I lay back on the seat , relieved . He was n't much older than I was . And he was handsome . Surely my father could n't keep me hidden away in a nunnery forever , without a chance to see anyone ? Nevertheless , these irrational fears chilled me , flowed through me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beetles . Cold perspiration ran down my neck . How was I going to become a geisha if I was shut away in a nunnery ? Nuns were kept out of sight from visitors and spent their time in meditation and arranging flowers , not in ogling the muscles of jinrikisha boys . As if the gods decided to remind me I had no choice , thunder rolled overhead . A downpour was on the way . I heard my father give the boy instructions where to take us , the boy nodding his head up and down . He bowed low before raising up the adjustable hood of steaming oilcloth covering us . A canvas canopy arched over the seat to protect us from the rain . " Hurry , hurry ! " Father shouted with urgency to the driver , then he sat back in the two-seat , black-lacquered conveyance . The boy grunted as he lifted up the shafts , got into them , gave the vehicle a good tilt backward and took off in a fast trot . Continues ...        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
