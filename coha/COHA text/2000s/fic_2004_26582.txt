Chapter One Complaint #1 The house I 'm about to set on fire stands alone on a hill . In this Westchester darkness , it resembles a lonely house Hopper might paint . A driveway wide enough for a truck . A lawn with trees and wide-open space you can picture Kennedy kids playing touch football - their smiles perfect , the knees of their khakis stained with grass . No ocean though , but a wooden porch does wrap itself around the house as if hugging it . Large windows and spacious bedrooms , an American house new immigrants dream of . The type of house America promises can be yours if you work hard , save your pennies and salute the flag . I open the screen door , punch in the alarm code and I 'm in . It 's my house , really . The owner does n't want it . It 's my house for these precious few minutes . I can indulge myself in snooping through someone else 's life . Walk through wooden floors that I hope to inhabit someday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these houses with my tin gallons filled with kerosene and quickly set to work at wetting the beds , couches and curtains . Light it all up with a flick of a match and quickly take off . Now I look around , wondering why , besides the money , does this person want his house taken out ? I pace around . I pick up pictures , stare at the loved ones . I see childhood secrets that were never known to me , secrets of horses and country homes , of summer vacations . I open drawers . Sift throughclothes . Read the spines of books and try to find clues about this person 's life . Once I burned a house where an entire set of cheerleader outfits sat in an attic closet , nicely folded . Was his wife the coach ? Did he kill these girls ? Who knows ? I walk around . This house is beautiful but the furniture is outdated , the lamps , doors and closets have old , yellow glows . In the living room , there 's a television with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall is a black rotary telephone that hangs like an extinct breed . In the kitchen , there is not so much as a toaster . The wooden chairs in the dining room are chipped , and the walls are crowded with portraits of Catholic saints , of fruits and landscapes . But it is the faded sunflower curtains and dead plants by the windows that pretty much indicates an old woman lived here . Now that she 's been put away , or is dead , this house seems to be used only as storage space , like a huge empty room where broken toys or unused objects from a previous life or a failed marriage sit lifeless . There 's sadness in this house . It feels like its children deserted it many years ago and not so much as even cared to look back . Not a single tear . All around , everything carries such sorrow . A darkness attaches itself to the walls , as if no light had ever shone , even when tiny feet ran around these floors . There 's a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on unwanted family history . Nothing in this house has been deemed worthy to be saved or treasured . Everything has been condemned to be erased by fire . But I ca n't really say for sure what happened here years ago that has made this house so bleak . But bleak it is . And now that the last of the old folks are gone , their grown children will light a match to unwanted memories . The house gets lit , the neighborhood stays the same color , and the property gets rebuilt with funneled insurance money . Just as well . It 's not my house , nor my memories . Even less , it 's not my place to ask . I do n't ask . I never ask . The people I work for do n't know me . I only deal with Eddie , and Eddie deals with them , and I do n't know who they deal with or how the insurance is fixed , all I know is that the bread gets passed around in that order . Me getting the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time now . The crumbs I get are large enough that I mortgaged an apartment floor in this old , battered , three-story walk-up . On the first floor , my friend Maritza has set up her crazy church , and the second floor is owned by a white woman I barely know . Though she seems nice , she rarely makes eye contact and is always on the go . She leaves the building early in the morning and I can usually hear her come back late at night when I 'm reading in bed . She does n't spend much time in her house or on fixing up her floor like I do . I 've been upgrading my floor slowly , because it 's so goddamn expensive . But I 'm happy there . At times and for no reason , I go outside and cross the street and stare at my building . I smile . See the third floor ? I own it , I tell myself . I see the windows a little crooked , not exactly fitting in their frames . Got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipping on all sides . Got to fix that . I like the gray shadow my building casts when the sun hits it from the west side of 103rd Street and Lexington Avenue , and how it 's sandwiched between Papelito 's botanica and a barber shop . I tell myself , I 've come a long way from the clubhouse I built as a little kid . I had gathered refrigerator boxes , painted them , cut open windows and doors , and placed my clubhouse on a vacant lot full of rats , charred bricks and thrown-out diapers . I called it the Brown House , home to the president of Spanish Harlem . What I was too young to know back then was that it was during the decade of my childhood that my future boss , Eddie , and guys like him were hired . Eddie burned down half of El Barrio and most of the South Bronx ... ( Continues ... )
