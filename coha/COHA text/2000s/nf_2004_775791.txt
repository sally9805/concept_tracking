A MODERN MAN // I 'm a modern man , digital and smoke-free ; a man for the millennium . A diversified , multi-cultural , post-modern deconstructionist ; politically , anatomically and ecologically incorrect . I 've been uplinked and downloaded , I 've been inputted and outsourced . I know the upside of downsizing , I know the downside of upgrading . I 'm a high-tech low-life . A cutting-edge , state-of-the-art , bi-coastal multi-tasker , and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond . I 'm new-wave , but I 'm old-school ; and my inner child is outward-bound . I 'm a hot-wired , heat-seeking , warm-hearted cool customer ; voice-activated and bio-degradable . I interface with my database ; my database is in cyberspace ; so I 'm interactive , I 'm hyperactive , and from time to time I 'm radioactive . Behind the eight ball , ahead of the curve , ridin ' the wave , dodgin ' the bullet , pushin ' the envelope . I 'm on point , on task , on message , and off drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 've got no urge to binge and purge . I 'm in the moment , on the edge , over the top , but under the radar . A high-concept , low-profile , medium-range ballistic missionary . A street-wise smart bomb . A top-gun bottom-feeder . I wear power ties , I tell power lies , I take power naps , I run victory laps . I 'm a totally ongoing , big-foot , slam-dunk rainmaker with a pro-active outreach . A raging workaholic , a working rageaholic : out of rehab and in denial . I 've got a personal trainer , a personal shopper , a personal assistant , and a personal agenda . You ca n't shut me up ; you ca n't dumb me down . ' Cause I 'm tireless , and I 'm wireless . I 'm an alpha-male on beta-blockers . I 'm a non-believer , I 'm an over-achiever ; Laid-back and fashion-forward . Up-front , down-home ; low-rent , high-maintenance . I 'm super-sized , long-lasting , high-definition , fast-acting , oven-ready and built to last . A hands-on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a love child who sends me hate-mail . But I 'm feeling , I 'm caring , I 'm healing , I 'm sharing . A supportive , bonding , nurturing primary-care giver . My output is down , but my income is up . I take a short position on the long bond , and my revenue stream has its own cash flow . I read junk mail , I eat junk food , I buy junk bonds , I watch trash sports . I 'm gender-specific , capital-intensive , user-friendly and lactose-intolerant . I like rough sex ; I like tough love . I use the f-word in my e-mail . And the software on my hard drive is hard-core-no soft porn . I bought a microwave at a mini-mall . I bought a mini-van at a mega-store . I eat fast food in the slow lane . I 'm toll-free , bite-size , ready-to-wear , and I come in all sizes . A fully equipped , factory-authorized , hospital-tested , clinically proven , scientifically formulated medical miracle . I 've been pre-washed , pre-cooked , pre-heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , double-wrapped and vacuum-packed . And ... I have unlimited broadband capacity . I 'm a rude dude , but I 'm the real deal . Lean and mean . Cocked , locked and ready to rock ; rough , tough and hard to bluff : I take it slow , I go with the flow ; I ride with the tide , I 've got glide in my stride . Drivin ' and movin ' , sailin ' and spinnin ' ; jivin ' and groovin ' , wailin ' and winnin ' . I do n't snooze , so I do n't lose . I keep the pedal to the metal and the rubber on the road . I party hearty , and lunchtime is crunch time . I 'm hangin ' in , there ai n't no doubt ; and I 'm hangin ' tough . Over and out . // EUPHEMISMS : It 's a Whole New Language // Euphemistic language turns up in many areas of American life in a variety of situations . Not all euphemisms are alike , but they have one thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shade the truth . But they exist for various reasons . // Sometimes they simply replace a word that makes people uncomfortable . For instance , the terms white meat , dark meat and drumstick came into use because in Victorian times people did n't like to mention certain body parts . No one at the dinner table really wanted to hear Uncle Herbert say , " Never mind the thighs , Margaret , let me have one of those nice , juicy breasts . " It would 've made them uncomfortable . // And at the same time , for the same reason , belly became stomach . But even stomach sounded too intimate , so they began saying tummy . It 's actually a bit sad . // I first became aware of euphemisms when I was nine years old . I was in the living room with my mother and my aunt Lil when I mentioned that Lil had a mole on her face . My mother was quick to point out that Lil did n't have a mole , she had a beauty mark . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty mark did n't seem to be working . And it confused me further , because my uncle John also had a brown thing on his face , and it was clearly not a beauty mark . And so on that day , I discovered that on some people what appeared to be moles were actually beauty marks . And as it turned out , they were the same people whose laugh lines looked a lot like crow's-feet . // By the way , that whole beauty-mark scare worked so well that some women routinely began using eyebrow pencils to apply fake beauty marks-a " fake mole " being something no self-respecting woman would ever think of giving herself . Somehow , I ca n't imagine Elizabeth Taylor turning to Joan Crawford and saying , " Lend me your eyebrow pencil , Joanie , I 'm gon na put a fake mole on my face . " // By the way , it was only a few years after the Aunt Lil incident that I took comfort in the fact that some people apparently thought my ugly pimples were nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to simply put a better face on things , to dress up existing phrases that sound too negative . Nonprofit became not-for-profit , because nonprofit sounded too much as though someone did n't know what they were doing . Not-for-profit makes it clear that there was never any intention of making a profit in the first place . // But some words that are euphemized are n't even vaguely negative , they 're merely considered too ordinary . For that reason , many things that used to be free are now complimentary . Asking the hotel clerk if the newspapers are free makes you sound like a mooch , but " Are the newspapers complimentary ? " allows you to retain some small bit of dignity . This is the reason some hotels offer their guests complimentary continental breakfasts , while others give their customers free doughnuts . // If you 're one who would enjoy a closer look at euphemisms , you 'll find a number of sections in the book that will interest you . I broke the euphemisms into segments , because they play such a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it The New Language , because it 's certainly new to me ; I know I did n't grow up with it . And that 's my larger point : that it 's gotten worse over time . There were probably a few early signs I noticed , but I knew the problem was getting serious when I began to hear ordinary people refer to ideas as concepts . // More to come . // STIFF UPPER LIP , YOU KNOW // Imagine two different commercial airliners taking long , fatal plunges directly into the ground from high altitudes . One is a British Airways plane filled with staid English diplomats and upper-class landed gentry . The other plane is Alitalia , filled with uneducated Sicilian , Greek and Turkish peasants . As the two planes dive toward certain destruction , which one do you think will have the louder screaming and the more colorful praying , cursing and blasphemy ? You get one guess . Hint : It is n't the British plane . // Eye Blaster : Get One Now // Are your eyes dry and itchy ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't take a chance .

If one of the two men is knocked down and beaten into an only partially blank and helpless mental state , the other is made to stand aside and the contest is halted momentarily , while the damaged man regains just enough strength to stand up and have the beating continue-to the point where he is again lying on the floor , this time completely immobile and functionless . Afterward , the two men embrace in a display of good sportsmanship. // REMEMBER YOUR UNCLE JOHN ? // Hi Billy . I 'm Uncle John . I came up to say goodnight . You remember your Uncle John , do n't you ? You remember the time I took you down to the beach and we set the hot dog stand on fire and three people died ? Was n't that fun ? Remember runnin ' away from the police ? And how we hid in the sewer and Uncle John got poo-poo all over him ? And he wiped it on your coat ? You remember ? And then I took you to the bar and got drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out of the jukebox and a fire started ? And all the people were screamin ' ? Remember that ? Remember the screamin ' ? And the ambulances ? Was n't that fun ? // And do you remember that other time ? The time I took you to the circus ? The lion got loose and ate a monkey ? Was n't that fun ? And they had to kill the lion ? And the monkeys got real sad , so they had to kill the monkeys , too ? Was n't that fun ? And then the man fell off the trapeze and smashed into the ground , and they had to kill him ? And all the other trapeze people got real sad and they had to kill them too ? Hah ? Was n't that fun ? // Why are you cryin ' , Billy ? Please do n't cry . If you stop cryin ' , I 'll take you to the rodeo . Would n't that be fun ? Maybe someone will get trampled , or gored . They 've got horsies and cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill a horsie . Or a cow . And if they kill a cow , maybe we 'll get to eat him in a hamburger . Would n't that be fun ? Please do n't cry . // Remember the time you fell outta my car ? Remember , you were lookin ' out the window , and we went around a corner real fast to keep from hittin ' that lady ? And you went flyin ' out the window and hit the pole , head first ? And the doctor had to sew your head up with a big needle ? I 've got a boat now , Billy . You wan na go out on my boat ? I promise I 'll be careful . Are you asleep yet ? Billy ? Please stop cryin ' . // COUNT THE SUPERFLUOUS REDUNDANT PLEONASTIC TAUTOLOGIES // My fellow countrymen , I speak to you as coequals , knowing you are deserving of the honest truth . And let me warn you in advance , my subject matter concerns a serious crisis caused by an event in my past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delivery truck . At that particular point in time , I found myself in a deep depression , making mental errors which seemed as though they might threaten my future plans . I am not over-exaggerating. // I needed a new beginning , so I decided to pay a social visit to a personal friend with whom I share the same mutual objectives and who is one of the most unique individuals I have ever personally met . The end result was an unexpected surprise . When I reiterated again to her the fact that I needed a fresh start , she said I was exactly right ; and , as an added plus , she came up with a final solution that was absolutely perfect . // Based on her past experience , she felt we needed to join together in a common bond for a combined total of twenty-four hours a day , in order to find some new initiatives . What a novel innovation ! And , as an extra bonus she presented me with the free gift of a tuna fish . Right away I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not totally complete , the sum total is I feel much better now knowing I am not uniquely alone . // THE CONTROL FREAKS // Hello . We 're the ones who control your lives . We make the decisions that affect all of you . Is n't it interesting to know that those who run your lives would have the nerve to tell you about it in this manner ? Suffer , you fools . We know everything you do , and we know where you go . What do you think the cameras are for ? And the global-positioning satellites ? And the Social Security numbers ? You belong to us . And it ca n't be changed . Sign your petitions , walk your picket lines , bring your lawsuits , cast your votes , and write those stupid letters to whomever you please ; you wo n't change a thing . Because we control your lives . And we have plans for you . Go back to sleep . // THEY CAME FROM OUT OF THE SKY // I find it discouraging-and a bit depressing-when I notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand , and on the other , to those who believe in an invisible supreme being who inhabits the sky . Especially as the latter belief applies to the whole Jesus-Messiah-Son-of-God fable . // You may have noticed that , in the media , UFO believers are usually referred to as buffs , a term used to diminish and marginalize them by relegating them to the ranks of hobbyists and mere enthusiasts . They are made to seem like kooks and quaint dingbats who have the nerve to believe that , in an observable universe of trillions upon trillions of stars , and most likely many hundreds of billions of potentially inhabitable planets , some of those planets may have produced life-forms capable of doing things that we ca n't do . // On the other hand those who believe in an eternal , all-powerful being , a being who demands to be loved and adored unconditionally and who punishes and rewards according to his whims are thought to be worthy , upright , credible people . This , in spite of the large numbers of believers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
