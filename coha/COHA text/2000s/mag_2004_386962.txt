Scientists are " sprouting " new ways to guard against cancer and other chronic diseases . <p> In 1992 , Johns Hopkins researcher Paul Talalay , M.D. , and colleagues found that an antioxidant called sulforaphane , produced in the body from a compound in broccoli , triggered the production of enzymes that helped detoxify cancer-causing chemicals . The discovery , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , attracted worldwide attention and was hailed as a major breakthrough in our understanding of the link between increased fresh vegetable consumption and reduced cancer risk . Subsequent studies found that sulforaphane prevented the development of breast and colon cancer , as well as other tumors , in mice , exhibiting a powerful role in cancer prevention and protection . <p> " Chemoprotection is a deliberate effort to increase the body 's defense systems against chemicals , including carcinogens , that can lead to disease , " according to Dr. Talalay . " Chemoprotection may lower a person 's risk of developing cancer by building up the body 's own defenses , particularly through diet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in broccoli ( a chemical called glucoraphanin , which the body turns into sulforaphane ) was 20 times more concentrated in young , three-day-old broccoli sprouts than it is in more mature broccoli plants . <p> To bring the exciting discovery to consumers , they formed Brassica Protection Products in cooperation with Johns Hopkins University . The company distributes the patented product called BroccoSprouts to grocery stores around the country . More recently , the team launched a line of teas enhanced with the antioxidant SGS ( sulforaphane glucosinolate ) . Proceeds from the products will help support the Brassica Chemoprotection Laboratory , designed exclusively to study cancer-fighting properties of plants . <p> To learn more about the discovery and health benefits of broccoli in battling various forms of cancer , Helicobacter pylori , and other chronic conditions , the Post spoke with plant physiologist Jed Fahey , who is manager of the Brassica Chemoprotection Laboratory at Johns Hopkins . <p> Tap into the healing power of Brassica Tea with SGS , which was developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins . The teas are available in four Chinese Sencha green tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SGS , Green Tea with Lemon and SGS , and Green Tea with Orange and SGS ; two Chinese black tea flavors ( regular black tea with SGS and decaffeinated ) ; and two herbal tea varieties ( Organic Red Bush Tea with SGS and Red Bush Tea with Lemongrass and SGS ) .

A natural compound , sulforaphane helps mobilize the body 's natural cancer-fighting ability by inducing protective enzymes . It also has antibiotic activity against a number of fungi and bacteria . <p> The cancer-protective effects of some phytochemical compounds  --  those in broccoli sprouts , in particular  --  are very broad-based . They induce protective enzymes in various tissues , especially in the liver  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhance an already-present capacity to detoxify carcinogens , which otherwise might create the mutations in individual cells that can lead to cancer . <p> We 've investigated extensively the metabolism of these compounds in humans , and trials are in progress in China specifically looking at liver cancer and the potential of broccoli sprouts to delay or prevent its onset . <p> Post : What led the team at Johns Hopkins to focus on broccoli sprouts and not just broccoli ? <p> Fahey : In looking for someone with plant expertise , Dr. Talalay hired me in 1993 , and I began the search for a " better " broccoli . I started collaborating with organic farmers who grew plants throughout Maryland , and it quickly became apparent that there was a huge amount of variability in broccoli . Focusing on smaller and smaller plants , I started broccoli seeds in my lab , growing the seeds to a certain size under precise , controlled conditions  --  light and temperature . I soon discovered that the smaller the plant , the more potent in terms of its chemoprotective , or cancer-fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sulforaphane ; the compound becomes diluted as the plant matures . Genetics also plays a role , so we grew varieties with very high levels of sulforaphane . <p> Post : How does sulforaphane reduce the risk of cancer ? <p> Fahey : A complex process , detoxification involves the coordinate stimulation of enzyme inducers with different functions . Some detoxify free radicals  --  highly reactive molecules linked to the cancer formation . Other enzymes reduce free-radical creation , and some conjugate carcinogens , allowing for more effective and rapid excretion in the urine . In other words , a carcinogen that would normally accumulate in the fat tissues of the body ( when conjugated to a molecule whose production is triggered by a chemoprotective enzyme ) may become more water-soluble  --  and thus more readily pass through the kidneys and be excreted . <p> Post : We recently featured an interview with Dr. Barry Marshall , who discovered the link between Helicobacter pylori and most ulcers . He mentioned your work and sulforaphane 's effectiveness in killing H. pylori . What led to this discovery , and does sulforaphane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When I began this research , I had visited broccoli sprout plants and heard anecdotal reports of people being cured of stomach problems  --  gastritis and ulcers  --  after eating broccoli sprouts . I made the connection that perhaps the sulforaphane in the sprouts was involved in the response and began investigating the action of sulforaphane against Helicobacter pylori . In laboratory tests , we discovered that sulforaphane killed Helicobacter pylori , which is linked causally to most ulcers and often-fatal stomach cancers . The discovery was a pleasant surprise . If clinical trials continue to support sulforaphane 's bactericidal activity against H. pylori , the finding could have broad public-health impact , especially in underserved areas of the world . Since about 80 percent of certain populations living in poverty and terrible sanitary conditions around the world are infected with Helicobacter pylori , curing this infection with a natural , inexpensive plant would have great potential to reduce the diseases caused by this infection . <p> Post : Should we also include more mature broccoli and other vegetables in the diet ? <p> Fahey : Optimally , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a diet already rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables . If someone is not fond of fruits or vegetables , broccoli sprouts might be a good way to expand their dietary horizons . We know for a fact that the fiber in vegetables is an important dietary ingredient that you will not get from a supplement  --  or tea , for that matter . To get sulforaphane in your diet , eat broccoli sprouts but do n't overlook other vegetables . A small amount of broccoli sprouts lacks the fiber contained in a large serving of broccoli . In a balanced diet , you need five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day . You still need fiber , vitamin C , and so forth that you will not get very much of from either vitamin pills or broccoli sprouts . <p> Post : Do other vegetables such as cauliflower contain sulforaphane ? <p> Fahey : Cauliflower  --  the vegetable that Americans are familiar with  --  does not . Cauliflower sprouts do . Cauliflower sprouts are exceedingly expensive to produce , however , because good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Post : What led you and the team at Johns Hopkins to develop broccoli sprout teas ? Does the tea taste good ? <p> Fahey : The tea is delicious . The company- Brassica Protection Products ( which I actually helped to found )  --  added sulforaphane ( they use the term " SGS " for " sulforaphane glucosinolate " ) into teas- black , green , and red . Many studies in the scientific literature suggest that tea has a cancer-protective effect . Given the fact that tea is healthy and many Americans drink tea , it seemed like a good beverage into which to add SGS , as opposed to soft drinks or juices that are high in sugar . These teas thus contain the same naturally occurring antioxidant compound found in broccoli and broccoli sprouts , and it is extracted directly from them . <p> Post : How do the 15 milligrams of SGS found in one of these teas compare with broccoli sprouts ? <p> Fahey : The 15 milligrams in a tea bag represent about one fifth of the amount in one serving ( 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of SGS . And that amount is equivalent to what is present in over one pound  --  about 20 ounces  --  of fresh broccoli . <p> The range of SGS in broccoli available at a supermarket varies tremendously  --  it can vary ten-fold . But if you take a rough average of the amount that you 'd find sampling ten heads in ten different grocery stores , the amount would be ten- to 20-fold less than the amount found in an ounce of sprouts . <p> Post : Are recipes available for broccoli sprouts ? <p> Fahey : Many recipes are available . I sprinkle sprouts on salad or add them to soups and casseroles . I know that Brassica Protection Products does have recipe cards available for consumers . <p> Post : Does cooking lessen SGS content ? <p> Fahey : No , although SGS is highly water soluble , like vitamin C. If you boil sprouts in water and throw away the water , you 're losing essential SGS . If microwaving , do it briefly and use minimal water . <p> I lean toward a Mediterranean diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked or not ) , strawberries , and blueberries . We do n't have anything but olive oil in our house , so I cook with it and use it on salads and in cooking . I wo n't touch butter or margarine . <p> Post : Are you involved in other research studies ? <p> Fahey : Yes . For example , we 've been looking at the chemoprotective potential of honey and various lesser-known plants such as Thai ginger . It appears that honey is also effective against Helicobacter pylori in studies from other labs , as well as in wound and burn healing . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : JED FAHEY <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Patrick Perry <p> BroccoSprouts Recipe El Charro Tomato , BroccoSprouts , Black Bean and Corn Soup with Crunchy Tortilla Strings ( Serves 4 ) TABLE <p> In large saucepan , add all ingredients up to and including cumin .
