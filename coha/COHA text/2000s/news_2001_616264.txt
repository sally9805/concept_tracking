<p> It 's 3:30 in the morning , and Andy Wallis is hyper . <p> He 's been gambling for hours in the casino aboard the Grand Princess , cruising somewhere off the coast of Greece . He knocks on the door to his cabin and wakes his wife inside . <p> Bobbie Wallis tilts her head away from the hallway light as she opens the door . <p> " So how much did you lose ? " she asks with a Gainesville drawl . <p> " Does this look like I 've lost ? " Andy says , his outstretched palms holding wads of $100 bills he 's pulled from his tux pockets . <p> Ten thousand dollars is n't a fortune for the millionaire couple from Georgia , but Andy revels in beating the house on what has already been a wonderful anniversary cruise . <p> With time only for a brief nap before their scheduled 7 a.m. tour of Athens with friends , Andy climbs into bed , exuberant yet exhausted . <p> " I love you , " he says , hugging his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Andy seems to doze off . His breathing deepens . <p> Moments later , he 's up again . <p> " Where are you going ? " Bobbie asks , thinking Andy 's excitement has gotten the best of him and he 's going to wake his friends for a little gloating . <p> " To the bathroom , " he says . <p> Bobbie falls asleep . Minutes pass , then something startles her . <p> " Andy ! " Bobbie calls out , bolting straight up in bed with her arms extended into the dark room , feeling the air on either side of her . <p> " Andy . . . <p> " Andy ! " <p> There is no answer from the bathroom . <p> Andy is gone . <p> Reliving the nightmare <p> Two years after what was supposed to be the cruise of a lifetime on the world 's largest passenger ship , Bobbie still has trouble remembering the details of the night her husband disappeared . <p> But she has forced herself to relive that evening and the days preceding her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string of lawyers push her to remember the finer points . Bobbie , 57 , has sued Princess Cruise Lines , saying the ship 's crew failed to call a proper sea search for Andy after it became clear he was missing . The trial is scheduled to start in September . <p> She is angry that while a Greek coast guard crew sunbathed on the back of its cutter , her friends chartered a helicopter and organized what they believe was the only timely search and rescue mission for Andy . <p> She is angry the ship 's captain insisted on leaving Athens to keep the cruise on schedule while Andy was still missing . She is angry she spent three hours under questioning by the Greek police , who she felt were all but accusing her of having something to do with her husband 's disappearance . <p> She is angry the massive passenger ship had no way to detect her husband 's fall or to stop it . <p> As much as anything , though , she has hoped the lawsuit would get her closer to understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a winning streak <p> Bobbie gets out of bed , walks across the ship 's dimly lit cabin and peers into the empty bathroom . <p> The room 's balcony door is open a few inches , but it 's raining . Andy would n't be out smoking in the downpour , Bobbie reasons . Andy probably opened it the night before , she thought , wanting ventilation for the air conditioner . <p> Maybe Andy 's back at the Casino , she thinks . Or perhaps he 's gone to wake the others and show off his winnings . <p> Dinner that night had been a race to get back to the casino for Andy . Earlier in the day he had won $3,000 while playing the $5 slots and sipping Crown Royal with water . He was eager to put the winnings back into slots and have a couple of more drinks . <p> " I 'm going to pluck ' em like a chicken , " Andy had boasted . <p> After dinner , Bobbie turned in for the night , telling Andy not to stay up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were starting early . <p> Now , sitting alone in the dark cabin , Bobbie decides she 'd better find Andy and get him to bed . If she does n't , he 'll try to back out of the day trip . <p> Groggy , Bobbie pulls on a pair of shorts and a T-shirt , grabs her room card and heads out into the long , deserted hallway . <p> The silence continues at the casino , where the once-busy gaming tables had been covered up and the bar emptied . <p> On the way back to her room , Bobbie sees a steward vacuuming . She asks the time . <p> It 's 4:30 in the morning . <p> Back at the room , Bobbie lies in bed , waiting . A half-hour passes and still no word of Andy . Bobbie takes a shower and gets dressed , figuring Andy has fallen asleep in one of his friends ' rooms and will be back by the time she 's finished . <p> At 6 , a wake-up call comes . Andy still is n't back . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friends , calls next . <p> " Bobbie , want to go have some breakfast ? " she asks . <p> " Andy 's not here , " Bobbie says . <p> " Well , where is he ? " <p> " I do n't know . I was hoping he 'd be in your room . " <p> After Bobbie hangs up , she figures Andy must be at the Crowthers ' . <p> A few minutes later , Denis Crowther phones . It 's 6:30 . <p> Andy is n't there , either . <p> Denis senses the sudden worry in Bobbie 's voice . He tells her to meet him in the hall . He 'll call the others . <p> It 's time to fan out and find Andy . <p> A reluctant traveler <p> When Bobbie and Andy boarded the Grand Princess with six of their closest friends in Barcelona , Spain , on June 28 , 1999 , their lives were peaking . <p> Andy , 55 , had sold his grading business for $4 million , and the Gainesville couple was clearing land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased in nearby Jackson County . Their three children were grown , and after years of hard work , the Wallises would have time to ride cutting horses , enjoy their granddaughter and travel . <p> Still , it took some convincing when Denis and Darlene Crowther invited the Wallises to join them for a two-week Mediterranean cruise . Ronnie and Cindy Lou Bergeron were going , too . The couples had met through a mutual friend and loved each others ' company . <p> Although the Bergerons and Crowthers lived in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , the Wallises often joined them for coastal jaunts on the Crowthers ' yacht or for hunting at the Bergerons ' ranch in the Everglades . <p> Andy initially scoffed at the idea of a Mediterranean cruise . He had n't even seen all of America yet , so why go to Europe ? <p> Andy was n't a fancy man . He was most comfortable in old boots and a Stetson . His long , skinny legs held up a hearty upper body , weathered from years outdoors on tractors and grading machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobbie figured he 'd back out . <p> But he did n't , and when a fourth couple pulled out of the trip , the Wallises invited their lifelong friends from Gainesville , Earl and Bessie Gilleland . <p> The couples booked mini-suites , with king-sized beds and balconies that hung out over the sea . The cruise would cost the couples $15,000 apiece , not including airfare to Spain . <p> For the Wallises , it would be the start of a new phase of their lives together . <p> A few months before the trip , Bobbie confided in her husband the changes were making her somewhat uneasy . She told Andy that whenever a couple decides to retire and take it easy , something bad happens . She 'd seen it happen before , to people they knew . <p> Andy told her not to worry . Everything would be fine . <p> Has anyone seen Andy ? <p> Back on the ship , Bobbie 's mind is racing . <p> Had someone seen Andy with all that money ? Did someone knock him in the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape ? Denis is n't so concerned . Andy 's probably up on one of the decks having coffee and watching the sunrise , he thinks . <p> The friends meet in the hall in front of the Wallises ' room . Everyone takes a floor or two . Bobbie and Denis head to the top of the ship . <p> Bobbie 's stomach tightens with each deck and no sign of Andy . <p> She feels sick as she and Denis meet the other men in the ship 's lobby to report Andy missing . It 's after 8 . <p> Someone suggests Bobbie check for Andy 's belongings . The last she 'd seen him , he was walking to the bathroom in his boxer shorts . If he left the room , surely he would have dressed . <p> Andy 's tux is still on the floor . So are his favorite shorts and his tennis shoes . No clothes are missing . The $10,000 Andy had won at the slots is on the table next to the television . <p> What about his cigarettes , someone asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls out a pack and a lighter . There is a knowing hush in the room . Andy , a chain smoker , would n't go anywhere without his Marlboro reds . <p> Bobbie 's mind clings to her abduction theory : If he was grabbed , they would n't let him have his cigarettes . <p> The men step onto the balcony . They had seen Andy sit on the balcony railing many times , just as they all had . Andy loved to watch the glowing green phosphorous trail that churned from the sides of the ship . <p> Denis Crowther leans over and looks into the water , 68 feet below . <p> He thinks of the cigarettes , the clothes , the lack of any sign that Andy is still on the ship . The evidence washes over him . <p> " Damn , " Crowther says , " he must have gone overboard . " <p> If Andy 's still alive out there , Crowther decides , they 're going to find him . <p> The take-charge type <p> Denis Crowther is rich and adventurous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he takes his $330,000 airplane into the shop for repairs , he grabs a wrench and gets under the cowling with the mechanics . <p> When he takes his 65-foot yacht to sea , he does n't bother hiring a crew . He is used to taking charge . <p> Crowther 's heart pounds as he steps off the balcony and rushes out of the Wallises ' room . He says nothing to Bobbie . <p> As he jogs nearly the length of the boat to the crew offices in the bow , Crowther 's mind runs through a checklist : Where can he get a chart ? How fast was the ship moving ? Where can he get a helicopter ? <p> Crowther was a helicopter crew chief during the Vietnam War , so he knows his way around a search and rescue mission . Before he made millions building custom yachts , he fished the waters off the North Carolina coast , selling bluefish for 50 cents a pound . He also owned the only boat in the area with radar , which meant he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help finding missing boats or men overboard . <p> At the end of the long hall , Crowther ignores the sign on the door : " Crew Only . Do Not Enter . " He pushes through and begins looking for the ship 's captain , Commodore Michael Moulin . <p> " I apologize for barging in , but we have a really bad feeling Andy could have fallen overboard , " Crowther says impatiently , standing at the door to the commodore 's office . <p> It 's clear to Crowther the commodore has reached the same conclusion . He is poring over a shipping chart , marking the overnight course into Athens . The crew is starting a search of the ship . <p> The commodore and Crowther talk about whether Andy could have survived the fall . At 23 knots , having fallen from more than 60 feet , Andy hit the water at more than 50 mph , they figure . Crowther believes Andy could have lived . He remembers jumping off bridges that high as a young boy . <p> Crowther asks the commodore to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any boat captain who locates Andy . He does n't think to specify whether that means dead or alive . Meanwhile , Nikos Restas , the local port agent for Princess Cruise Lines , locates a helicopter and pilot for hire at Athens International Airport . <p> Morning traffic is thick , and it takes Retsas more than an hour to get Crowther , Gilleland and Bergeron to the airport . Tense with anticipation , Crowther assigns his friends seats in the chopper . Scan small areas and stick to your sight quadrant , he tells them . If they see Andy , the men decide one of them will jump out and get him . <p> " If he 's out there , " Crowther assures them , " we 'll find him . " <p> It 's 11:30 a.m. by the time the chopper lifts off . Andy has likely been in the water nearly eight hours . <p> Inside the search zone , the men see a Greek coast guard boat moving slowly away . There are no other ships in the area . Crowther wonders why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pilot takes the chopper down to 500 feet . From that height , the men can see under the water several feet . The pilot circles anything they locate in the water  --  Styrofoam coolers , chunks of wood , a deck chair . Each unsuccessful pass up and down the Grand Princess ' route is more painful than the last . <p> After three hours in the air , the chopper 's fuel is running low . <p> " Could he be alive ? " Bergeron asks . <p> " It 's going to be hard for him to have survived this long , " Crowther replies . <p> " You know , we ca n't just give up , " Bergeron says . <p> " I know , " Crowther says , staring at the water . <p> Abandoning ship <p> In her cabin , Bobbie faces a decision she does n't want to make . Get off the cruise ship here in Athens or stay on board and go to Turkey . By 4 , Commodore Moulin makes it clear he intends to keep the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Andy is still on the ship , she does n't want to leave him . If he 's in the waters off Greece , she does n't want to be in Turkey . <p> Her friends convince Bobbie they have to get off . The women pack up frantically , leaving makeup and hair brushes in the bathrooms . <p> Bobbie and the women had spent the morning answering questions from the commodore and the Athens port police . <p> Everyone talked as if Andy had certainly fallen off the ship and died . For Bobbie , their words were like darts . <p> " These people do n't know what they 're talking about , " she thought to herself . " Andy 's here somewhere . I 'll find him . " <p> The commodore had been more blunt than anyone else . He told Bobbie her husband fell off the balcony and could n't have survived the fall . From that height , he said , the water was like " concrete . " <p> Bobbie shook her head . " No , he would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raining . " <p> That was n't rain , the commodore said , it was the window washer several decks above . <p> Bobbie looked at him , trying in vain to process what that meant . <p> " No , " she said again , " he would n't be out in the rain . " Praying for a miracle <p> The men decide to take the chopper for a second search after the pilot refuels . <p> Crowther calls the ship and talks to Moulin , telling him there are no other boats or aircraft searching for Andy . Gilleland calls the wives , who tell him they have been asked to leave the ship . <p> An hour and a half later , the men are in the air again . The water is 73 degrees . Andy could conceivably be alive , if he 'd done everything right . <p> They fly over the same Greek coast guard boat , still stationary in the water . It appears the crew is sunbathing on the rear deck . Crowther is furious . There should be search boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he complains aloud . <p> Back and forth they fly , up and down . Circling . Peering into the water . <p> Praying for a miracle . <p> Nothing . <p> As the sun sets , the men make a final silent pass , then turn toward Athens . <p> The only thing left now is to tell Bobbie . <p> Truth put on hold <p> Crowther is crying as Bobbie walks into his room at the Athens hotel where the group has checked in for the night . <p> A shipping chart is unfolded across the bed . <p> Sliding his finger across the paper map scribbled with coordinates , Crowther shows Bobbie the search pattern they flew . He assures her they would have seen Andy had he been treading water out there . <p> " Is Andy dead ? " Bobbie asks . <p> " I think so , Bobbie . " <p> " Did he suffer ? " <p> " Bobbie Jo , I think he died as soon as he hit the water . " <p> The truth would have to wait . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her then , and she is haunted by images of her husband gasping for air and treading water in the black ocean night . <p> Days after the accident , Andy 's body washed up on a small Greek island near the area Crowther and the men had searched so frantically . An autopsy revealed no broken bones or lacerations , meaning Andy might have survived the fall . <p> The pain of such images is amplified by the years they spent together . Bobbie had loved Andy since high school . <p> Bobbie has kept the Gainesville ranch running as best she can , relying mostly on hired help or her three grown children to cut the grass and tend the horses . She 's trying to sell the land she and Andy planned to retire on , land he was grading himself for their dream home . <p> Bobbie hurts for her children , too . They said goodbye to their father thinking he 'd be gone for just two weeks . Vallie Jo , Bobbie 's 5-year-old granddaughter , tells strangers her " Poppy " fell off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know what happened on the balcony that July night two years ago . They can only guess . Did the water from the window washer above startle him or cause him to slip on a wet deck ? Did he lean too far over the balcony ? Did he fall asleep and tumble over ? <p> Everyone who knows Andy says he was too happy to commit suicide . He was a driven man who had never revealed signs of depression . And even though Athens port police detectives initially asked Bobbie about such things as insurance policies , fights she and Andy may have had and even extramarital affairs , foul play was ruled out . <p> In her lawsuit against Princess Cruises , Bobbie claims her husband died as a result of the ship 's failure to act . Under international maritime regulations , the ship was required to contact the Rescue Coordination Center in Athens as soon as it suspected a man was overboard . Wallis says the crew never did . <p> In a prepared statement , Princess said that while they are sympathetic to Bobbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless tragedy . " His wife and friends had seen him sitting on the balcony 's railing earlier in the trip , the statement said , adding that the railing exceeds U.S. Coast Guard standards . <p> The cruise line also stated that its crew complied with " all applicable laws under the circumstances " and that the appropriate Greek authorities were immediately notified . The company points to documents prepared by Greek authorities that say a search was conducted by air and by water . <p> Denis Crowther insists there were no other search vehicles in the area during the five hours he was in the air . <p> Even now , Crowther and his wife feel guilty for having talked Andy into the cruise . <p> " I pray he did n't suffer and lose all hope and finally give up . I hope it knocked him out cold , I do , " Crowther says somberly . " I 'll ask him one day . " 6:30 a.m. : Wallis ' friends search for him .
