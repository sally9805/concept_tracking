<p> The 61st annual Tony Awards last night were dominated by two shows drawn from the 19th century : " Spring Awakening , " about sexually frustrated German teenagers in that era , won best musical and most of the other musical awards , while " The Coast of Utopia , " Tom Stoppard 's epic period trilogy about Russian intellectuals , set a record for the most awards won by a play in Tony history . <p> " Coast , " an eight-and-a-half-hour epic produced by Lincoln Center Theater , won best play , best director , best featured actor and actress , and several design awards . <p> " I feel a bit nostalgic , actually , " Mr. Stoppard said , " since it 's been 40 years since I first came here with a play , and I 'm sentimental enough to thank the New York theater for having me , for good times and good friends . " <p> The play was a $7.5 million gamble for the nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater that paid off in critical acclaim and popular success . Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to the state of the art board of directors of Lincoln Center who urge us on in our follies . " <p> " Spring Awakening , " a musical that transferred from the Atlantic Theater Company Off Broadway , won eight awards , including those for best musical , book , score , direction and choreography and best featured actor in a musical . <p> The stage swarmed with the show 's three dozen or so producers when the top award was announced . <p> " We thank you for creating a Broadway show that rocks , " Ira Pittelman , one of the show 's lead producers , said to the writers of " Spring Awakening . " <p> In the night 's highest-profile nail-biter , Julie White of " The Little Dog Laughed " won best actress in a play , beating out acting legends like Vanessa Redgrave ( " The Year of Magical Thinking " ) and Angela Lansbury ( " Deuce " ) , as well as the actresses Swoosie Kurtz ( " Heartbreak House " ) and Eve Best ( " A Moon for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , my God , " Ms. White said . " You Tony voters , what a bunch of wacky , crazy kids ! " <p> " To be nominated with such extraordinary women  --  I never imagined I would be on a list like this unless it was for dinner reservations at Angus , " she said , referring to a well-known Broadway hangout . " And then to get the tchotchke ! " <p> A minor upset took place in the best leading actor in a musical category , where David Hyde Pierce , playing a detective in the Kander and Ebb murder mystery-comedy " Curtains , " beat out Raul Esparza from " Company , " Jonathan Groff from " Spring Awakening , " Michael Cerveris from " LoveMusik , " and Gavin Lee from " Mary Poppins . " <p> Mr. Pierce , who looked genuinely stunned , said his first line on a Broadway stage was " I 'm sorry , I 'm going to have to ask you to leave now .

" The category was a particularly strong one this year , featuring critically acclaimed performances by Christopher Plummer , Liev Schreiber , Boyd Gaines and Brian F. O'Byrne , but Mr. Langella had long been the favorite . <p> " I think we must honor the common bond in us , " Mr. Langella said , " for the struggle , the striving for success , because that 's a race you simply ca n't lose . " <p> On the musical side , " Spring " was followed in its victory count by another unconventional Off Broadway transfer , " Grey Gardens , " a musical about the eccentric mother and daughter , Edith Bouvier Beale and little Edie Beale . <p> " I want to thank you all for embracing the two little engines that could , ' Spring Awakening ' and ' Grey Gardens , ' " said the designer William Ivey Long upon receiving the award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is encouraging for all the regional theaters , all the little basement theaters . " <p> Christine Ebersole won for best leading actress in a musical for playing both Big and Little Edie Beale in " Grey Gardens . " Though she was in one of the toughest categories of the night , up against Audra McDonald ( " 110 in the Shade " ) , Donna Murphy ( " LoveMusik " ) , Debra Monk ( " Curtains " ) and Laura Bell Bundy ( " Legally Blonde : The Musical " ) , Ms. Ebersole was considered a favorite . <p> " I left Hollywood when they told me I was over the hill , " she said . Now , she added : " I 'm over the hill in the role of a lifetime ! This is so encouraging . " <p> Accepting his award for the score of " Spring Awakening , " the composer Duncan Sheik , who cut his teeth in the world of popular music before writing for theater , said to the show 's producers : " Thank you for letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And musical theater rocks . " ( Steven Sater , who won for book , shared that award with Mr. Sheik . ) <p> Michael Mayer won best director for the show , and Bill T. Jones won best choreography . The show also picked up the best featured actor in a musical award , for John Gallagher Jr. , who plays the suffering , shock-headed Moritz . <p> Mr. Gallagher made his Broadway debut just last year ; Mary Louise Wilson , who won best featured actress in a musical for her portrayal of the elderly Big Edie Beale in " Grey Gardens , " first appeared on Broadway in 1963 . This was her first Tony . <p> " I used to wonder , if I ever won one of these things , would I feel like there was a mistake made , would I feel that way ? " she said , looking down at her award . " And  --  I do n't . " <p> " Company , " John Doyle 's stark adaptation of the 1970 Stephen Sondheim-George Furth musical about marriage and its discontents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this category there were echoes of last year , when Mr. Doyle 's radical interpretation of Mr. Sondheim 's " Sweeney Todd " was up against ( but lost to ) " The Pajama Game , " a more faithful revival . This year " Company , " which has struggled at the box office , found itself up against , and eventually prevailed over , the revival of " A Chorus Line , " a faithfully restored musical and a box office hit . <p> The play awards were anything but varied in the early going , with " Coast " picking up every Tony in sight . Billy Crudup won for best featured actor in a play for his portrayal of the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky , while Jennifer Ehle won her second Tony for portraying three different characters in the three parts of " Coast . " Jack O'Brien won best director . <p> " Now let 's have no more nonsense about the state of the American theater , " Mr. O'Brien said . <p> And " Journey 's End , " R. C. Sherriff 's World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 , won best revival of a play , just hours after it closed following months of anemic sales . <p> " First , let me put down immediately a widespread rumor , " said Bill Haber , one of the lead producers . " The show did not bankrupt me . Close . " <p> In the special theatrical event race , referred to by wags around Broadway as the dummy versus the drag queen , " Jay Johnson : The Two and Only , " a show featuring a ventriloquist , beat out " Kiki &; Herb Alive on Broadway , " a show featuring a cabaret duo ( of which Kiki was the drag part ) . <p> In a ceremony that took place before the live broadcast , the awards for orchestration , set , costume and lighting design were given out by the cast of " Jersey Boys , " two of whom won Tonys last year .

" " I 'm completely gobsmacked . " <p> The show 's broadcast kicked off with Marvin Hamlisch playing the well-known opening chords of " One , " from " A Chorus Line , " currently in revival , segueing into that show 's opening number , " I Hope I Get It , " and then the famous gold kick line . <p> The Tony Awards ceremony , broadcast from Radio City Music Hall , is the last hurrah of the Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though there was no monster new hit  --  " Mary Poppins " being the only show that came close  --  Broadway as a whole continued to flourish , setting a new record for paid attendance with 12.3 million people . That 's a jump of 2.6 percent from the previous year , according to the League of American Theaters and Producers . Grosses grew at a much higher rate , up 8.9 percent to $939 million from $862 million . The discrepancy is due in large part to increasing ticket prices , including the now prevalent " premium " tickets , which can go for as much as $350 . <p> The Tony Awards are voted on by 785 producers , journalists , union officials and other industry professionals . They are presented by the league and the American Theater Wing , a nonprofit service organization that created the Tonys in 1947 . <p> The television ratings for the Tonys have traditionally been less than impressive , a problem made worse this year with the broadcast up against the final episode of " The Sopranos " on HBO .
