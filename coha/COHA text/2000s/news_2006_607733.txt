<p> Mike Vanderjagt is a good guy . Just ask him . <p> He 's also a very , very good kicker . Again , he 's more than willing to serve as a reference on this point , too . <p> But " good " wo n't be good enough for Vanderjagt in his first season with the Dallas Cowboys . And he knows it . <p> " All I have to do , " Vanderjagt said here this week at the Cowboys ' training camp , " is make every kick I try . " <p> Wide receiver Terrell Owens was n't the only monstrously talented and accomplished player with a checkered past that the Cowboys signed as a free agent in the offseason to try to make a Super Bowl push after two non-playoff seasons that left owner Jerry Jones and Coach Bill Parcells fidgety . They added Vanderjagt , the 36-year-old kicker who spent eight seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and , in between drawing the public ire of quarterback Peyton Manning , established himself as the most accurate field goal specialist in NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a number that he can cite off the top of his head , and does so several times in the span of a single conversation . He said he wants to get even better . He never expects to miss . When he sent a couple kicks sailing wide right of the goal posts during a practice this week , with Parcells looking on with his arms folded , Vanderjagt removed his helmet in anguish , squatted on the turf with a look of disgust and then stormed off to another field to right the wrongs by drilling one perfect kick after another while his teammates had moved on to other things . <p> " I 'm one of those perfectionists , " Vanderjagt said after that practice . " I do n't think a missed field goal , for me , is acceptable regardless of the distance , regardless of the situation , regardless of whether it was a good hold or bad hold . I just feel if I put my foot on it , it should go in . Those have been my expectations . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I 'm on top of the percentage in history because I just do n't accept misses regardless of why . " <p> He is a lean 6 feet 5 and 218 pounds and Parcells , who generally has no use for kickers , actually manages to muster some praise for his new one . " I was happy to see his conditioning level when he got here , " Parcells said . " That was good . " <p> Parcells upped the ante for Vanderjagt during the offseason when he said the Cowboys , with better kicking , could have had three more victories last season than the nine they managed . No one has been bashful about telling Vanderjagt what he 's supposed to accomplish . <p> " Oh , I 've heard the three-game thing a lot , certainly , " he said . " I 've got three games placed on my shoulders this year I 'm supposed to turn around . . . . Bill told me . Jerry told me . Everybody in the stands has told me . . . . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got here . I felt like I could make a difference . " <p> But he comes to his new team with Owens-like baggage , at least by kicker standards . His legacy in Indianapolis could have been all positive  --  the success story from Ontario who endured years of obscurity in the Canadian Football League and the Arena League to become the top kicker in NFL history . Instead , his stay with the Colts perhaps is best remembered for him once publicly criticizing Manning and Coach Tony Dungy for a lack of fire  --  leading Manning to call him an " idiot kicker " during a televised interview  --  and for the last kick that he took for the team , sending a would-be tying field goal hopelessly wide right in the closing moments of a loss at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers in an AFC semifinal in January . <p> Vanderjagt said he knew when the season ended that he would n't return to the Colts ; even if he 'd made the kick against the Steelers , he said , he would n't have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going in a different direction , " he said . <p> But would he have been willing to return if the Colts had wanted him back ? <p> " No , " he said . " I was happy to get out of there . . . . It 's water under the bridge . I 'm just going to go forward and not worry about it . Ninety-nine percent of that organization are great people . " <p> Dungy said during the offseason that he wishes Vanderjagt well and he has no problems with his former kicker , not even for appearing on the " Late Show with David Letterman " right after the Pittsburgh game . Dungy said he does n't hold Vanderjagt responsible for the loss to the Steelers . But the Colts replaced Vanderjagt by signing the greatest clutch kicker in league history  --  Adam Vinatieri , the two-time Super Bowl hero for the New England Patriots  --  as a free agent . Vanderjagt met with the Miami Dolphins and drew interest from the Patriots and Green Bay Packers but signed with the Cowboys . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but jokes that he 's keeping a close eye on Vanderjagt , given the kicker 's history with Manning . " We went and played some golf a little bit , " Bledsoe said . " I do n't think he 'll be a problem . " <p> Vanderjagt , like Owens , is taking it slowly with his new teammates , trying to fit in . He said he 's giving Owens every benefit of the doubt because he feels a certain kinship with the embattled wideout . <p> " I came into the Dallas Cowboys with the expectation that I 'm not going to judge T.O . until I 've met him and been around him and gotten a feel for what kind of guy he is , " Vanderjagt said . " Just because of what people say about him does n't necessarily make it true . As far as I 'm concerned , he 's a good guy . He 's been to the meetings . He goes to practice . He works hard . Until he screws up , I 'm going to keep him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , you wo n't realize how good a guy I am . I think the same thing about T.O . Just because it was written about him and just because it was written about me does n't make it true . " <p> He must adjust to having a new holder , backup quarterback Tony Romo , and to not having the luxury of playing half his games indoors at the kicker-friendly RCA Dome . He and Parcells soon will have to decide whether he will handle kickoffs , something that was a point of contention at times in Indianapolis when the Colts turned over the duty to others . Vanderjagt said his career is not defined by his missed kick against the Steelers , and he would relish another opportunity to have a field goal try with the season on the line . <p> " I 've always said in the past that you do n't get a whole lot of chances to make or break games and when you do , that should be something that excites you , " he said . " It 's not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call timeout and try to ice you and all that stuff . I 'm actually excited about it . Specifically the Pittsburgh kick last year , I got in the locker room in true disbelief because there was not a thought in my mind that it was n't going in . That 's the way I look at every kick . It 's something that I enjoy . It 's something that I embrace . I do n't choke . I 'm not a choker because I love that environment . I love to be in the middle of the spotlight when the game 's on the line . "
