Tiger Eye By Marjorie M. Liu Dorchester Publishing Marjorie M. Liu Dela had mysterious dreams the night before she bought the riddle box . A portent , maybe . She did not think much of it . She was used to strange dreams , only a few of which had ever come true . Still , she was alert when she left the hotel the next morning , stepping into the dry furnace of a rare clear Beijing day . Winds had swept through the night , sloughing away the smog and scent of exhaust and decay . Blue sky , everywhere . Sun glinted off the glass of skyscrapers , cars , diamonds - the aluminum spines of umbrellas shading dark-eyed women - casting sparks in Dela 's unprotected eyes . The world trickled light . The city had changed . Ten years of capitalist influence , spinning a web of glass and advertisements ; a modern infrastructure sweeping over the land as surely as the fine Gobi dust imported by the northern winds . A new cultural revolution , here in the city , across China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could hear Beijing 's growing song , the soul of the city - the collective soul of its thirteen million inhabitants - etched into the steel . Dangerous , alluring - she did not like to listen long . There was too much hunger in that voice , overwhelming promise and hope , twisted with despair . A double-edged blade , forged from the dreams of the people livingtheir lives around her . Just like any other big city , she reminded herself , pouring strength into her mental shields . Devils and angels , the lost and found . Cabs swarmed the hotel drive - like fire-ants , fast and red - and Dela jumped into the first one that squealed to a stop . Directions , spoken in perfect Mandarin , slipped off her tongue . One week in China , and her old language lessons had returned with a fury . True , she sometimes practiced with her assistant , Adam - a former resident of Nanjing - but regular life had settled its wings on her shoulders , years without stretching herself , dredging up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dela thought she might have forgotten all those parts that were not metal , of the forge , and was glad she had not . The cab wrenched from one clogged lane to another - a hair-raising mish-mash of roaring engines and squealing tires - curving down a tree-lined street where colorful exercise bars lined a scrap of shaded park . Elderly men and women pushed and pulled their way through rotating stress exercises , children screaming on seesaws . Bicycles overburdened with cargo , both human and vegetable , trundled down the crowded street , cars swerving to avoid the monstrously wide loads , as well as the packs of ragged young men darting across the road . Dela saw a familiar low wall , cracked with age , its carved flowers and barbed wire still unchanged . She tapped the plastic barrier and the driver let her out before the wide entrance , scratched blue doors flung open to admit both foreigners and locals , making their way through a treacherous maze of parked bicycles . Dela saw faces bright with curiosity and greed . Entering Pan Jia-Yuan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip-offs and bald-faced lies - a treasure hunter 's paradise . And Dela was in the mood to hunt . Dust swirled around her feet as she slipped past crooked old men and women hawking nylon shopping bags to beleaguered early birds , hands already full of purchases . Stepping onto the concrete platform shaded by a voluminous tin roof , she listened to cheap jade jingle : bracelets , statues , necklaces . Pretty enough , and quite popular , if the gathered crowds were any indication . Nothing caught her eye . Potential gifts , perhaps , for acquaintances who would appreciate the gesture . Not good enough for actual friends , few and far between - deserving of special care , something beyond trinkets . But later . Dela had something else to find . She combed the shadowed interiors of the open-air stalls , searching until she heard a familiar call inside her mind . Weapons . She followed the whispers to their source . Scimitars and short swords ; Tibetan daggers , hilts engraved with piled grinning skulls . Mongol bows , rough with use and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere , dusty tinted steel - but all of it disappointing . The metalwork was poor - cheap imitations for not-so-cheap prices . Dela stared at the eager merchants , who smiled at her blond hair , pale skin , and electric eyes . Easy mark . She could see it written on their faces , and their judgment made her feel lonely ; a foreign emotion , and unpleasant . Bad enough they probably think I 'm dumb , she thought sourly . Solitude was a gift , but only when paired with anonymity - the disinterested observer . Dela frowned at herself . You should n't have returned to China if you did n't want to stand out . Buck up , girl . She left the weapons stalls , ignoring protests - some of which bordered on desperate - with a polite shake of her head . Those weapons offered her nothing . She knew quality when she saw it , age and history when she felt it . A simple thing , when one worked with steel as much as she did . When it sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dela simply wandered for a time , soaking in the heat , the scents of incense and musty artifacts kept too long in shadow . She watched children sell boxed breakfasts of fried noodles and onion pancakes , crying out prices in high voices . She listened to an old man play a lilting melody on a stone flute , and bought one of his small instruments . He laughed when she tried stringing notes together , the hollow stone wheezing miserably . Dela grinned , shrugging . After nearly an hour of browsing , Dela found something perfect for her mother . Generous rectangles of linen , dyed a vibrant navy , embroidered with delicate stylized flowers - a bouquet of colors , random and perfect . She bargained like a fiend , dredging up every scrap of charm and language she possessed , and by the end of the transaction , both she and the seller were grinning foolishly . " Aiii yo , " sighed the older woman , as she smoothed glossy silver hair away from an oval face that looked at least twenty years younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkindly . " It has been a long time since I met a foreigner who made me work for a sale . " Dela laughed . " It 's been a long time since I met anyone I enjoyed arguing with . " The woman quirked her lips , and for a moment , her gaze changed , becoming older , darker , wiser . " I have something else you might want . " " Ah , no . I think I have enough . " The old woman ignored her , already digging through the tapestries and knickknacks piled at her feet . Dela watched , helpless . She did not have the heart to simply walk away . A good haggle created a bond - certain unspoken etiquette . The " last chance " possibility of a final transaction . The late summer heat was growing oppressive ; air moved sluggishly between the stalls , thick with wares and milling bodies . The scents of dust and grease tickled Dela 's nose . Sweat ran down her back . Slightly bored and uncomfortable , she turned full circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the aisle caught her eye . He was of an indeterminate race , darkly handsome , wearing sandals and loose black slacks , as well as a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up . Crisp , clean , and somehow out of place , although Dela could not determine exactly why . At first she thought he was staring at her - and perhaps he had been - but now he studied the old woman digging through her wares , and Dela felt inexplicably uneasy for her . His eyes were cold , measuring , haunted by a simmering intensity that would have been overwhelming if not matched to such an attractive face and body . When the old woman popped up with a triumphant sigh , Dela stepped close . " Behind me , " she whispered , not caring if the woman thought her strange , " there is a man watching you . " Her gold-flecked gaze flickered ; something hard rippled through her face . " I am used to him . He seems to think I have something he wants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The old woman smiled . For a moment , her teeth looked sharp , predatory . " Which is why I am going to do you a favor . For one yuan , you may have this riddle box . " Dela stared . One yuan was an incredibly low price for the Dirt Market , where everything was inflated to exorbitant amounts , especially for foreigners . She gazed at the object in the old woman 's hands . Loosely wrapped in linen , she saw soft lines , rounded edges . Wood , perhaps , although she imagined the hint of something harder beneath the cloth . No metal . Nothing called to her . " What is the riddle ? " Dela asked . The old woman bared her teeth . " Choice . " Dela looked at her sharply and reached for the box . The woman pulled away , shaking her head . " Bought and sold , " she whispered , and Dela was struck by the intensity of her stare , more powerful than the gaze of the strange man still observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One yuan , please . " Dela could not bring herself to argue , to refuse . Despite the odd air surrounding the transaction , the vague uneasiness pricking her spine , she fished a bill from her purse and handed it to the old woman . Another sigh , and the old woman looked deep into Dela 's eyes . " A good choice , " she said , and Dela sensed some deeper , inexplicable meaning . She carefully slid the wrapped box into Dela 's purse - a swift act , as though to conceal . Dela felt uneasy . You know better , she chided herself . This ' box ' could be full of drugs , and you 're the stupid American courier , traipsing around until you get pulled over by the cops , and thrown into a sweaty prison . Or not , she thought , staring into the old woman 's mysterious face . Dreams and portents , she reminded herself , fighting down a shudder . The stifling air was suddenly not warm enough . Her bones felt cold . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like any other Dirt Market hawker . Eyes sharp , but somewhat glassy . Easy mark eyes . " Bye-bye , " she said , and turned her back on Dela . The sudden reversal in attitude , from intimate to dismissive , took Dela off guard . She almost protested , but from the corner of her eye , felt the strange man 's attention suddenly weigh upon her . An odd sensation ; tangible , like sticky fingers on the back of her neck . Impossible to ignore . Go , whispered her instincts . Without another look at the old woman , Dela walked down the aisle , away from the strange man and his searching eyes . She did not look back ; she moved gracefully through the thickening crowds , slipping between stalls and merchants , ragged men and women rising from their haunches to shove vases in front of her flushed face . Her chill vanished ; the heat suddenly felt overwhelming , the press of bodies too much , the sensation of being hunted tightening her gut . Premonition haunted her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found herself near the front gates . Heart pounding , she jogged to the street and hailed a cab . A breath of cool air brushed against her sweaty neck . " My , " drawled a smooth masculine voice . " You are in a hurry . What a shame . " Dela was used to unpleasant surprises , but it was still difficult not to flinch . The strange man stood beside her , intimately close . Perfectly coifed , breathtakingly handsome . She disliked him immediately . He was too perfect , fake and unreal . Even his voice sounded over-cultured , as though he was trying to affect an unfamiliar accent . There was nothing kind about his smile , which skirted the edge of hunger , conceit . He made Dela 's skin crawl , and she stepped out of his shadow , frowning . A cab stopped in front of her ; Dela opened the door to slide in . The stranger caught her hand . His touch burned , and she barely kept from gasping at the strange sensation . His skin felt thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual fire , to her ice . Shock turned to anger . " Get your hand off me , " she said , low and hard . He smiled . " It has been a long time since I had a conversation with a beautiful woman . Perhaps I could share your cab ? I know a lovely courtyard restaurant . " Conversation ? Beautiful woman ? Dela would have laughed , except he clearly expected her to say yes ; he even nudged her toward the cab , maintaining his iron grip on her hand , his smile as white and plastic as a cheap doll . " I do n't think so , " Dela snapped , surprised and pleased to see his dark eyes shutter , his smile falter . Did he really think she would be so easily cowed , so stupid and desperate ? " And if you do n't let go of me this instant , I am going to start screaming . " Perhaps it was the cold promise in Dela 's voice ; all charm fled the stranger 's face . The transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smelling faintly of garlic , pepper . His gaze , dark and oppressive , lifted the hairs on the back of Dela 's neck . Something fluttered against her mind , then , bitter and sharp . Dela clenched her jaw so tight her teeth ached , and the stranger smiled . A real smile , bright and blistering and sharp . " How interesting , " he said , squeezing her hand until her bones creaked . The pain sparked rage , striking Dela 's fear to dust . No one hurt her . Ever . Not while there was still breath in her body . Loosening her jaw , Dela smiled - and screamed . It was a marvelous scream , and Dela took an unholy amount of glee in the look of pain that crossed over the stranger 's face . Bikes crashed into cars ; passersby stopped dead in their tracks to stare . Dela pulled against his hand . " Help me ! " she screeched in both Chinese and English . " Please ! This man is trying to rob me ! He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Dela did not think she had ever sounded so frightened or pathetic in her entire life , but the horrible part was that while she had started out acting , the growing fury in the man 's face suddenly did scare her . He looked like he wanted to kill her with his bare hands - as though he would , right there with everyone watching . Her entire arm screamed with pain as his fingers crushed bone . Soldiers , common enough on Beijing 's streets , ran from the gathered crowd of onlookers . Strong young men , they latched onto Dela 's assailant , wrenching him away from her . It was quite a struggle ; he was very strong and refused to let go of her hand . When he did , a cry escaped his throat ; a bark of frustration , anger . Dela slipped backwards into the cab , fumbling for the door , eyes wide upon the hate distorting that handsome face . The urge to run overwhelmed and she rapped her knuckles on the plastic barrier . The startled cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into traffic , car brakes squealing all around them , horns blaring . Within seconds , the Dirt Market - and the ongoing struggle outside its gate - was left behind . Dela rubbed her arms , shuddering . Her face felt hot to the touch , but the rest of her burned cold . She bowed her head between her knees , taking deep measured breaths . The breathing helped her sudden nausea , but her heart continued to thud painfully against her ribs . She managed to tell the driver the name of the hotel , and then held her aching hand , trying to forget the feel of the man 's fingers squeezing flesh and bone . The hot ash of his skin . The cool tremble against her mind . A great stillness stole over Dela as she rode the memory of that sensation . She could count on one hand the number of times a stranger had purposely pressed his mind to her own , and while her shields were strong - her brother had made sure of that - Dela was in no mood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't know I was different until the end . Which meant the stranger had followed her out of the Dirt Market for another reason , one that had nothing to do with her psi-abilities . Dela remembered his cold dark eyes , how he had watched the old woman long before paying attention to her . What was his need , his purpose ? Through her purse , Dela felt a hard lump . The riddle box . Clarity spilled over her , and she almost examined her tiny purchase then and there . She caught the driver watching her through his rear view mirror , and hesitated . If she really had just purchased something awful like drugs or God-knows-what , she did not want any witnesses when she began poking her nose into Trouble . If that was what the riddle box represented . He ca n't find me , Dela reminded herself . That creep has no idea who I am , and this is a big city . It was a small comfort .
