AS YOU GUARD YOUR PRIVACY AGAINST STANDARD THREATS LIKE SPYWARE AND PHISHING , YOUR DATA IS LEAKING OUT VIA LEGIT FIRMS YOU DO BUSINESS WITH . BY ERIK LARKIN // GPS QUERIES , CELL phone calls , Web searches-all are quick conveniences . We get our directions , chat with our friends , find our sites , and never think of that data transaction again . But these records create a growing problem , say privacy advocates : They leave a detailed digital trail of where we went , who we talked toeven what we were thinking . The records can persist for decades , and no comprehensive federal law protects them . Even if you believe the firms you do business with would n't sell your records to an unscrupulous marketer , you 're not safe . As long as it exists , your data can be sold in bankruptcy proceedings , or snagged by hackers , con artists , and anyone with a court order , says Ari Schwartz , deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology , a consumer advocacy organization . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of recent cases have demonstrated just how vulnerable the records can be . BEYOND THE LIMIT GPS DEVICES CAN be 3 godsend for intrepid explorers and the easily lost alike . But as one court case shows , the intensely personal details of your physical location and driving behavior can be gathered and used against you . Connecticut-based American Car Rental installed GPS devices in its cars to track speed and location , according to state supreme court documents . The devices wirelessly phoned home to American every time a client drove faster than 79 mph for at least 2 minutes ; American then tried to charge its customers $150 for each instance . American was sued , and the court ruled that the company could not charge a speeding fee-but the court did n't prevent the firm from using GPS devices to track driver speed and location . Government may get into the GPS act as well . To make up for a projected gas tax shortfall ( ironically due to successful fuel efficiency programs ) , Oregon 's Department of Transportation is considering a tax based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every car would track the mileage . Photograph CHRIS HOOFNAGLE , West Coast office director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center , a consumer advocacy organization . // The department 's Web site assures state residents that " no privacy issue exists " with the plan , because the devices would send in only number of miles driven and not location info . But while Oregon has opted not to record locations , there is little to indicate that , like American Rental Car , it could not do so if it chose . RULES ROULETTE BECAUSE NO comprehensive national privacy laws exist , figuring out what a business ( or government ) can do with your data depends on your state , the industry , and the type of information involved . " One company could be covered by seven or eight different types of privacy laws , " says the CDT 's Schwartz . Advocates have pushed for a national standard for years , but acknowledge that we 're nowhere near getting one . Consider something as private as what you watch on television . Cable companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ca n't do with the details of your viewing habits ; for instance , they are generally prohibited from sharing your information with third parties . But digital video recorders like TiVo fall outside those laws , says Schwartz . " TiVo has a pretty strong privacy policy for what they do with the information " they collect , and the company is bound by it , he says . But coming up with that policy was a business decision , not a legal mandate , and the company could choose to change its policy at any time . " The consumer dilemma is , similar products or services can have very different privacy implications , " says Chris Hoofnagle , West Coast office director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center , a privacy advocacy group . Users should n't be expected to know that , he says , " but they are . " SEARCHED AND SEIZED USERS WHO ARE concerned about privacy also need to know details about what every business actually does with their information . Take Internet searches , for example . Once you get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Search companies do n't forget . They store those searches , often along with an identifier showing who ran the search ; how well the firm safeguards your data varies by search engine . The important questions , Hoofnagle says , are : " How long will the data be kept , for what purposes will it be used , and what do the companies do when the police come knocking on the door ? " A case in point : The U.S. Department of Justice recently sought " a massive amount of information from Google 's search index , and ordered Google to turn over a significant number of search queries entered by Google users , " according to court documents . The Justice Department subpoenaed several search engines for information in defense against a lawsuit brought against the U.S. Attorney General 's office over the Child Online Protection Act . According to the Justice Department and the judge 's ruling , AOL , Microsoft , and Yahoo all complied with the request at least in part . In fact , many companies ' privacy policies state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought , and won . Sort of . The judge ruled that the government could have a list of some site addresses found in Google 's index , but denied the demand for search terms . The government had not asked for information that might have specified who conducted each search , but U.S. District Judge James Ware noted several potential privacy risks related to search strings , such as in the case of a " vanity search " where someone might look for data about themselves . And he highlighted a potentially serious privacy concern with searches run by a third party about another party , such as " name third trimester abortion san jose . " Google does n't disclose its data retention policies , and it did n't respond to our questions about those policies . But Hoofnagle says that data older than 180 days can be subpoenaed more easily than newer info . Google cookies last over three decades on your PC . Like Google 's searches , Yahoo 's use a cookie with a unique code ; each search is tied to that identifier . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age or location , but if you search while logged in to Yahoo , that search is tied to your Yahoo profile . Yahoo stores those search details " for as long as it 's useful , " says spokesperson Nissa Anklesaria . And they 're useful indeed . Yahoo 's successful finance site came about in part because the firm saw many people running searches for financial information . However , Yahoo keeps your personal details to itself : Even when Yahoo works with third parties on ad campaigns and special offers aimed at users , it never gives user data to its partner , Anklesaria says . // CELLULAR SIEVE EVEN IF A company does not willingly share your information with third parties , you may not be safe . Until the beginning of this year , your cell phone call list , for example , was easy pickings for unscrupulous agents . So-called pretexters were making a thriving business of calling cell phone firms , masquerading as a client , and getting a copy of that person 's last bill-with a list of all phone numbers for calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered those records to anyone willing to shell out $150 or so . The good news is that these sites are shutting down due to an " incredible amount of enforcement scrutiny , " says Hoofnagle , whose organization has testified before Congress on the matter . But since the demand for your data is n't going away , " my fear is that they 'll simply move it underground , " Hoofnagle says . Government , he says , treats privacy issues like isolated fires : Scandals erupt when thieves steal loads of information from data brokers or pretexters run amok , then Congress crafts specific laws in response . A law setting national standards for data privacy would prevent many of those fires , but none is likely anytime soon . Until Congress changes its crisis approach to privacy issues , users who want to take control of their private data are on their own . <p>
