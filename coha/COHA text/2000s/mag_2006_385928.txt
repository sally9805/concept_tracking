The lotion contains idebenone , a powerful ingredient that stops environmental aggressors in their tracks . 40s : One vial of Krastase Lipo-Recharge ( $60 for ten vials ) is enough to revitalize fragile tresses . 50s : Use makeup that 's specially formulated with antiaging benefits .

For shopping information , see page 129. 30s MAKEUP FOUNDATION : " Heavy coverage is aging , so keep your coverage clean and sheer , " says makeup artist Melissa Silver . " Use a concealer on spots , and then apply a superlight foundation or a tinted moisturizer . " As celebrity makeup artist Sandy Linter puts it , " You should not be able to see foundation on the skin . " Three sure bets : Prescriptives Traceless Skin Responsive Tint ( $32.50 ) , Lancome Imanance Tinted Day Creme SPF 15 ( $40 ) and Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer oil Free ( $40 ) . COLOR : " This is agreat time to have a little fun with color or shimmery makeup , so explore , " says makeup artist Rebecca Restrepo . " Wear a red lip color like Kevyn Aucoin Beauty Liquid Patent Lip in Infernelle ( $27 ) . Or for an all-over , healthy glow , try a luminous lotion like Laboratoire Remde Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dover , a Boston-based dermatologist , swears by Neutrogena 's new sunblocks , like Age Shield Sunblock SPF 30 ( S9.49 ) , which contain the latest sunscreen , helioplex . " It 's the best UVA filter available in the States , and it 's similar to Mexoryl , Europe 's coveted sunscreen , " he explains . " It protects skin for four or five hours . " Around the delicate eye area , we like using a gentle mineral sunscreen , such as Clarins Sun Wrinkle Control Eye Contour Care SPF 30 ( $24.50 ) or Carita Progressif Anti-Age Solaire Eye Contour Cream SPF 15 ( $56 ) . HAIR " A lot of my thirtysomething clients have children , " says Susanna Romano , a partner and stylist at Manhattan 's Salon A-K-S . " Postpregnancy , their hair sheds , and what 's left is weaker . I suggest that they take Phyto Phytophanre dietary supplements for hair and nails ( $48 ) , and when I see them again , I really notice a difference in thickness and luster. " 40s MAKEUP FOUNDATION : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and ensures that your makeup wo n't look flat and cakey , " says Silver . " I like Clarins True Comfort Foundation Light Reflecting SPF 15 ( $36 ) . You can also wear a moisturizer with a subtle pearly glow , like Aura Science Recoup Recovery Cream ( $50 ) , underneath a standard foundation . " COLOR : " Skin does n't have the fullness and pep that it used to , " says Restrepo . " You need a little color every day . Blush brings life to your complexion-I like Three Custom Color Specialists Crme to Powder Blush in Rose or Salmon ( $20.50 ) and Giorgio Armani Sheer blush in No. 2 or No. 3 ( $40 ) . Or brighten your face with a lip stain like NARS Dolce Vita lipstick ( $23 ) . " SKIN " Retinoids , derived from vitamin A and available in prescription creams , have been proven to minimize wrinkles in rigorous studies , " says Dover . " Retinol , a cousin of retinoids , is available in over-the-counter products , but it is less effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A and Renova , can be very irritating , so you may prefer a gentler retinol-based cosmetic , such as Doctor 's Dermatologic Formula ( DDF ) Retinol Energizing Moisturizer ( $85 ) or Cosmedicine MegaDose PM Skin Fortifying Serum ( $85 ) . 40s HAIR " Your hair goes through middle age too , " says stylist Paul Lahrecque , owner of Paul Labrecque Salon in New York City . " In your forties , as much as 20 to 30 percent of your hair can turn gray , and those strands tend to snap and break . Treat tresses gently ; do n't subject them to drastic changes in color , and do build up their outer layer with repairing masks . " Paul Labrecque Repair Condition Lemongrass Treatment ( $45 ) restores hair 's moisture and nutrients for strong , shiny locks . 50s MAKEUP Primer : " As your skin develops more fine lines , it is n't as smooth a surface as it used to be , " says Silver . " Even out your skin with a primer so that your foundation will glide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30 ) , Napoleon Perdis Auto Pilot ( $45 ) and Global Goddess Upgrade Complexion Face Primer ( $35 ) all prep skin for makeup . Powder Alternative : " Powder settles in creases and accentuates unevenness , " says Jo Strettell , celebrity makeup artist for Sephora . " There is nothing less attractive . " Instead , control oil in your T-zone with blotting paper like M.A.C Blot Film ( $12.50 ) , Victoria 's secret Beauty Rush ( $7 ) or Clinique Pore Minimizer ( $13.50 ) . Also , switch to a cream blush . SKIN If you notice your skin is drying out ( blame decreasing levels of the hormone estrogen ) , it 's time to switch to a richer moisturizer and eye cream . Try Kiehl 's new Ultra Facial Cream ( $22.50 ) , which was road tested by climbers on the mountain peaks of Greenland . For your eyes , try Darphin 's cult favorite , Stimulskin Plus Eye Contour Cream ( $130 ) . Wearing eye cream at night , though , may lead to fluid retention and undereye puffiness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education at Declor and Carita . If you 're prone to these conditions , use eye cream only in the morning . HAIR To preserve the natural oils that keep hair shiny and vibrant , stylist Eva Scrivo , owner of the Eva Scrivo Salon in New York City , recommends that you use shampoo every other day , or even every third day , and switch to an especially gentle one without sulfate-based detergents . We like Louise Galvin Sacred Locks Hair Cleanser ( $44 ) and Sebastian Evokativ Full Shampoo ( $16 ) . 60s MAKEUP " As your face starts to sag a bit , you 'll want to apply your blush a little higher up-rub it only on the apples of your cheeks , and blend well , " says Silver . " Blush positioned too low on the face draws attention to your jowls , and when streaked up the cheek to the temple , it emphasizes gauntness . " SKIN Dr. Howard Sobel , a dermatologist , recommends monthly glycolic peels . " Glycolic acid decreases sun spots and the buildup of dead cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this outer layer helps minimize the appearance of fine lines . You can get a glycolic peel at a dermatologist 's office like Sobel 's ( 960A Park Avenue , NYC ; 212-288-0060 ) . Or try an athome version , like DDF Glycolic 10% Exfoliating Moisturizer ( $45 ) , Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating Gel ( $48 ) or LOral ReNoviste Anti-Aging Glycolic Peel Kit ( $24.99 ) . HAIR " As you age , your face , just like your hair , loses color , or pigment , " points out Louise Galvin , a colorist at Manhattan 's John Barrett Salon . " If you were getting a single-process hair color in your thirties or forties , the same color wo n't work on you in your sixties . The starker contrast between your face and hair coloring will make you look washed out , so tone down your hair color just a bit . " You can also embrace going gray , but " you do n't want it to look drab , " says Scrivo . " Give gray hair a lift with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's available in salons . " 70s HAIR " Many women in their seventies have thinning hair , " says Scrivo . " Instead of using a typical drying volumizer like mousse , I restore fullness with Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray ( $18 ) , which adds thickness with a salt solution . " Another novel volumizer is Avcda 's new Pure Abundance Hair Potion ( $22 ) , a powder that turns into a lotion when you rub it into the palm of your hand . Run the versatile potion through your hair before you blow-dry or set it , or after it 's dry . SKIN If facial fat has declined , leaving your face looking more hollow , restore fullness with MD Skincare Intense Hydra Mask ( $60 ) . It 's made mostly of hyaluronic acid , which is naturally present in your face . Apply it at night , and your skin will soak it up for a plumper look by morning . MAKEUP Loss of collagen is a major factor in thinning lips . Lip liners provide crucial definition , but , advises Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipstick ( instead of under it ) and then blending . Clinique Sheer Shaper for Lips in Black Honey ( $13.50 ) and Prescriptives Sheer Lip Pencil in Sheer Caramel ( $15.50 ) are super-easy to blend . Silver adds : " Lip gloss can feather into fine lines , so get the wet effect of a gloss by using a lipstick with the right finish . Try Este Lauder Pure Color Crystal Lipstick in Crystal Pink , Ripe Papaya , Berry Fizz or Tiramisu ( $22 each ) . " <p>
