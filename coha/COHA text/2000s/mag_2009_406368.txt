Ten years ago , I was happily married ( still am ) , but I noticed a couple of things happening around me . For one , about half the couples my wife , Holly , and I knew - all of whom had children - had separated . Plus , I kept meeting younger ( late 20s and early 30s ) parents who were in a relationship with someone other than their children 's biological mother or father . As a long-time married couple ( we celebrated our 27th anniversary last March ) , we were almost starting to feel like oddities . But we 're not - not yet , anyway . According to Statistics Canada , the divorce rate has changed very little in the last 20 years and , in 2005 , StatsCan reported that only 38 percent of couples would divorce before their 30th wedding anniversary . But among couples who do split , the average length of a marriage is about 14 years . So if you and your partner have been together half that long , it 's probably time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage counsellors for tips on how to keep the love alive - and stay out of their offices ! May I have your attention , please Here 's the good news : According to Seattle-based marriage-therapy guru John Gottman , one of the keys to staying together is to do something you 're probably already doing , some - if not much - of the time . Gottmah 's research has shown that a couple 's happiness often hinges on how well they respond to each other 's " bids " - the gestures , big and small , people make many times a day to get attention , affection or mere acknowledgement from their partners . Some bids are obvious : hugs , kisses and direct requests , such as " Can we talk ? " But bids can also be more subtle : " What 's a six-letter word for perseverance ? " or " This hangnail is really hurting today . " Why are these bids so important ? They reveal a lot about a couple 's longterm stability . In the early 1990s , Gottman studied 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not include any same-sex couples , but Gottman believes his findings would be relevant to them as well . ) He videotaped the partners ' interactions for 24 hours , and then analyzed the data . Six years later , researchers followed up with the same couples . Those who were still happy were dubbed the masters . Couples who 'd divorced or who were still together but miserable became known as the disasters . The analysis revealed that the masters noticed and responded to their partners ' bids 87 percent of the time . Not every interaction was mushy or effusive ; often , it was just a quick answer , a look or a nod that conveyed interest - what Gottman calls " turning toward your partner . " What 's more , says Darren WiIk , a Langley , BC , therapist trained and certified in the Gottman method of marriage counselling , the masters typically remained attentive to one another even when they were discussing a problematic issue , whether by listening , not interrupting or saying things such as " I see your point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as likely to ignore as they were to answer each other , no matter what the topic . " They were n't necessarily fighting or being mean to each other constantly , " says WiIk . " But they did n't respond to their partners ' bids nearly as often . " None of the less successful couples were really aware of the little ways they were shutting their partners out . " They rated themselves as happy in their relationships and did n't think they were in trouble , " WiIk says . " The take-home lesson here : Pay attention to your partner and be mindful of how negative you are during conflict , " says WiIk . " This is something we do really well when we 're in the courtship stage of a relationship . " . But once couples become very comfortable with each other - and very busy with jobs and child care - they tend to pay less attention to these little moments of connection . Share the load Another sign of potential trouble down the road , says Ottawa marriage and family therapist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as parents . This happens frequently when one partner - usually mom becomes far more involved in the care of young children than the other , and starts feeling overloaded and resentful , while the other - often dad feels out of the loop . " Fathers who feel their partner is n't paying enough attention to them should ask themselves , Am I pulling my weight ? Am I as involved with the children as I could be ? Am I making more work for her ? " says Guthrie . Many men do n't realize it , says WiIk , but taking on more of the mundane tasks around the house can be a big investment in your relationship . " The biggest bang for your buck is initiative , " he says . " See what needs to be done , and do it without being asked . " Women , for their part , need to make room for daddy . Guthrie suggests women ask themselves : Am I doing anything to exclude him ? Am I being critical of his efforts , expecting him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way ? " Mothers sometimes need to remind themselves that putting energy into being a wife and partner does n't take anything away from their kids , " says Guthrie . Beware of the communication busters Few if any marriage counsellors would say that partners should never fight , but they do suggest that you try to " fight fair . " That 's because some ways of dealing with conflict tend to make it worse . Three of the biggest culprits are criticism , defensiveness and stonewalling . We 're all critical at times - it makes us feel superior , WiIk says . But criticism tends to breed defensiveness and when people feel defensive , they often make excuses , deny responsibility and fire back counter-criticism . Couples end up arguing about who is more wrong rather than trying to understand the other 's point of view . Gottman 's research revealed that , typically , women are criticizers and men are stonewallers . Guys get flooded when dealing with conflict or criticism , says WiIk , " and they just want to leave . " That may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heck out of the other partner , and the conflict can become more entrenched . What men need to do , WiIk says , is find ways to convey that they want to deal with the problem . " So say , ' Fm overwhelmed and upset right now , but can we talk in half an hour ? ' " Meanwhile , the antidote to criticism , says WiIk , is complaining without blaming . This means talking about yourself - how something about your partner , or something he is doing , affects you . It also means asking for his help . So instead of saying " You never call , " try explaining your position : " I need to know when you 're going to be late . " Guthrie notes the importance of remembering that every story has two sides . " Be curious about where your partner is coming from , rather than just relying on your interpretation of his actions or motives , " she says . And it never hurts to acknowledge what your own part in the problem might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most cases , it 's not all your partner 's fault , either , " Guthrie says . Deal with it We all do it : skirt around a significant , recurrent issue that causes tension with our partners . Maybe we fear what will happen if we bring it up , and just keep hoping it will go away by itself . But Guthrie advises that couples address these " wedge issues , " rather than let them fester . " When you 're avoiding a problem , your closeness can become more awkward , and over time it takes a toll , " she says . One partner needs to take the risk of saying " We have a problem here and we need to talk about it . " Let the heat of the moment pass and set up a time when you can both be on your best behaviour . But be realistic . Gottman 's research found that trying to change things can actually be a major pitfall for some couples . " They concluded that 69 percent of the problems that couples were dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People would keep discussing them , all the while becoming increasingly frustrated with each other . The better approach , says WiIk , would be to accept that certain problems ( and , ahem , attributes of your partner ) must simply be lived with . WiIk , for example , admits he is seldom on time for anything . And my wife will never understand my way of giving directions . " Realize that you may be talking about such issues forever , so put some energy into developing gentler , less demanding , more productive ways of discussing them , " says WiIk . Sometimes couples do need outside help to work through issues . A word from the wise : If you think you and your partner should be in counselling , do n't put it off . " Research shows that most people wait too long - six or seven years from the origin of their problems - before they go for therapy , " says Guthrie . " Seeking help is definitely not a sign of failure . It 's actually a positive way to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
