Reality TV could n't get any more real than the stuff that Emma Gilding records with her handheld camera . This consumer anthropologist focuses on the scenes that no network would dare show you  --  tooth flossing , toast buttering and sock sorting . Gilding dives deep into the consumer psyche for clients like American Express , AT &T; Wireless and Huggies . As founder and global director for Ogilvy &; Mather 's Discovery Group , she sends camera-toting researchers to study consumers as if they were part of some undiscovered civilization . <P> And to her , they are . Gilding , 32 , spent her undergraduate days studying behavioral science and theatrical performance in London . She took a liking to video , and after wandering into advertising , made consumers the stars . Her researchers sometimes spend months with their subjects , studying body language and probing decision making about everything from beer to cell phones . The hours of footage are compressed into a 30-to-40-min. narrated documentary . Then Gilding brings in specialists in fields like psychology to pick apart the video and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our goal is to put the consumer back into the equation , " says Gilding . " He is there to teach us , and we are there to learn . " <P> When Huggies hired the Discovery Group last year , Gilding and her crew spent 12 to 15 hours daily with first-time and experienced mothers . They found evidence that Huggies needed to change its ad pitch , which had long portrayed a " happy baby " headed toward a fabulous career  --  a diaper-clad banker , for example . " But in the late ' 90s there was a shift , " says Gilding . " A happy baby was one that was learning about himself rather than a proposition for the future . Mothers were less interested in a ' mini-me . ' " Gilding 's film showed mothers enthralled as Baby discovered her toes or a new stuffed animal . The research persuaded Huggies to launch a new campaign , straight out of reality . <P>  --  By Carole Buia                 @ @ @ @
