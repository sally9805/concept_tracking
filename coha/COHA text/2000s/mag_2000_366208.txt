Swallow . " I 'm sorry . Wait a minute . " Swallow . " Can I add something ? " Time Warner chairman Jerry Levin is speaking . It is 9 a.m. on the day after Levin and Steve Case , the CEO of America Online , have inked the biggest deal in corporate history . Levin is nibbling on pieces of fruit , sipping room-temperature mineral water and projecting a becoming tranquillity . He looks as if he 's just stepped in from Harvard Yard , wrapped in a forest green corduroy jacket with an open-necked plaid shirt tucked underneath . When he speaks , his voice has the delicate cadence of a professor singing out the most violent passages of Macbeth with a studied calm . He has , it seems , left his globe-striding , Gulfstream-riding , options-exercising CEO persona somewhere on the other side of this megadeal . The only flaw in this picture , frankly , is a fist-size interactive pager that is dancing between Levin 's palm and his pocket . The pager chirps from time to time , and Levin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbwheel to scroll through a few messages and then slips it back into its case . Occasionally , he pokes out a quick message on the device 's Chiclet-size keys . Chirp . Pop . Click-click-click . It 's almost a Macarena rhythm . 1-2-3-4-5 . Lou Gerstner , the CEO of IBM , sends Levin a congratulatory e-mail . Chirp . Pop . Click-click-click . <P> As all this has been going on , almost as if it were scripted , Case , sitting at Levin 's left elbow , has been doing a little samba of his own . The Steve Case dance will be familiar to anyone who has been within two feet of a mailbox in the past decade , where Case 's dance card came along with a disk inviting the recipient to join AOL . So far , 20 million have taken him up on the offer . Case , who was raised in Hawaii and is partial to batik shirts , seems to have ditched his old look wherever Levin left his Gulfstream . Besuited and betied , Case is also clearly bewitched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a web of entertainment and information . It 's a world , he says , where cell phones , televisions , computers , cars , maybe even refrigerators , will all be tapped into a data network that makes it as easy to talk to Singapore as to call your next-door neighbor . And AOL Time Warner , he begins to explain , will be the company that makes all that happen . But now Levin has something to say , so he puts the pager aside and begins to tell a story . <P> The gist of the tale is that back in 1972 , when Levin started his first job at what was then Time Inc. , he worked in the company 's cable-television division on 23rd Street in Manhattan . At the time , in those Pleistocene cable days , some genius had the idea of building a real-time TV news service that would allow Time Inc. ' s cable subscribers to have direct access to the headlines , as opposed to having to wait for Huntley and Brinkley or Walter Cronkite or even , God forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. ' s wizards came up with a solution that would have done a kindergartner proud : first they purchased an AP teletype machine ( the kind with the clattering printer and bells ) . Then they jacked it into the wall of Levin 's office . Then they pointed a camera at it . The result : Headline News , circa Nixon . And a love affair  --  between Jerry Levin and technology . " I thought , " he said last week , " ' This is terrific . ' " Levin had become a geek.
