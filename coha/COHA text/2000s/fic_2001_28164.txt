What Derek Strange was worried about , looking at Jimmy Simmons sitting there , spilling over a chair on the other side of his desk , was that Simmons was going to pick some of Strange 's personal shit up off the desktop in front of him and start winging it across the room . Either that or get to bawling like a damn baby . Strange did n't know which thing he wanted to happen less . He had some items on that desk that meant a lot to him : gifts women had given him over the years , tokens of gratitude from clients , and a couple of Redskins souvenirs from back in the 1960s . But watching a man cry , that was one thing he could not take . " Tell me again , Derek . " Simmons 's lip was trembling , and pools of tears were threatening to break from the corners of his bloodshot eyes . " Tell me again what that motherfucker looked like , man . " " It 's all in the report , " said Strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And right after that , I 'm gon na kill his ass again . " " You 're talkin ' no sense , Jimmy . " " Fifteen years of marriage and my woman 's just now decided to go and start taking some other man 's dick ? You 're gon na tell me now about sense ? God-damn ! " Jimmy Simmons struck his fist to the desktop , next to a plaster football player with a spring-mounted head . The player , a white dude originally whose face Janine 's son , Lionel , had turned dark brown with paint , wore the old gold trousers and burgundy jersey from back in the day , and he carried a football cradled in one arm . The head jiggled , and the Redskins toy tilted on its base . Strange reached over , grabbed the player , and righted it before it could tip over . " Take it easy . You break that , I ca n't even charge you for it , ' cause it 's priceless , hear ? " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right eye and ran down one of his plump cheeks . " Shit . " " Here you go , man . " Strange ripped a Kleenex from the box atop his desk and handed it to Simmons , who dabbed tenderly at his cheek . It was a delicate gesture for a man whose last day under three hundred pounds was a faded memory . " I need to know what the man looked like , " said Simmons . " I need to know his name . " " It 's all in the report , " Strange repeated , pushing a manila envelope across the desk . " But you do n't want to be doing nothin ' about it , hear ? " Simmons opened the envelope and inched out its contents slowly and warily , the way a child approaches an open casket for the first time . Strange watched Simmons 's eyes as they moved across the photographs and the written report . It had n't taken Strange all that long to get the goods on Denice Simmons . It was a tail-and-surveillance job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common type of work he did . He had followed Denice to her boyfriend 's place over in Springfield , Virginia , on two occasions and waited on the street until she came out and drove back into D.C. The third time Strange had tailed her , on a Sunday night when Jimmy Simmons was up in Atlantic City at an electronics show , he had waited the same way , but Denice did not emerge from the man 's apartment . The lights went out in the third-story window where the man lived , and this was all Strange needed . He filled out the paperwork in the morning , picked up the photographs he had taken to a one-hour shop , and called Jimmy Simmons to his office the same day . " How long ? " said Simmons , not looking up from the documents . " Three months , I 'd say . " " How you know that ? " " Denice got no other kind of business being over in Virginia , does she ? " " She works in the District . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card bills , the ones you supplied ? Denice has been charging gas at a station over there by the Franconia exit for three , three and a half months . The station 's just a mile down the road from our boy 's apartment . " " You think she 'd be smarter than that . " Simmons nearly grinned with affection . " She never does like to pay for her own gas . Always puts it on the card so I 'll have to pay , come bill time . She 's tight with her money , see . Funny for a woman to be that way . And though she knows I 'll be stroking the checks , she always has to stop for the cheapest gas , even if it means driving out of her way . I bet if you checked , you 'd see they were selling gas at that station dirt cheap . " " Dollar and a penny for regular , " said Strange . Simmons rose from his chair , his belly and face quivering as if his flesh were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'll see you , Derek . I 'll take care of your services , soon as I see a bill . " " Janine will get it out to you straightaway . " " Right . And thanks for the good work . " " Always hate it when it turns out like this , Jimmy . " Simmons placed a big hat with a red feather in its band on his big head . " You 're just doing your job . " Strange sat in his office , waiting to hear Simmons go out the door . It would take a few minutes , as long as it took Simmons to flirt with Janine and for Janine to get rid of him . Strange heard the door close . He got out from behind his desk and put himself into a midlength black leather jacket lined with quilt and a thin layer of down . He took a PayDay bar , which Janine had bought for him , off the desk and slipped it into a pocket of the jacket . Out in the reception area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . Behind her , a computer terminal showed one of the Internet 's many sites that specialized in personal searches . Janine 's brightly colored outfit was set off against her dark , rich skin . Her red lipstick picked up the red of the dress . She was a pretty , middle-aged woman , liquid eyed , firm breasted , wide of hip , and lean legged . " That was quick , " he said . " He was n't his usual playful self . He said I was looking lovely today- " " You are . " Janine blushed . " But he did n't go beyond that . Did n't seem like his heart was all that in it . " " I just gave him the bad news about his wife . She was getting a little somethin ' - somethin ' on the side with this young auto parts clerk , sells batteries over at the Pep Boys in northern Virginia . " " How 'd they meet ? He see her stalled out on the side of the road or something ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about . " " Pulled over to give her a jump , huh . " " Now , Janine . " " This the same guy she was shackin ' up with two years ago ? " " Different guy . Different still than the guy she was running with three years before that . " " What 's he gon na do ? " " He went through the motions with me , telling me what he was going to do to that guy . But all 's he 'll do is , he 'll make Denice suffer a little bit . Not with his hands , nothin ' like that . Jimmy would n't touch Denice in that way . No , they 'll be doing some kind of I 'm Sorry ceremony for the next few days , and then he 'll forgive her , until the next one comes along . " " Why 's he stay with her ? " " He loves her . And I think she loves him , too . So I guess there 's no chance for you and Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time soon . " " Oh , I can wait . " Strange grinned . " Give him a chance to fill out a little bit , huh ? " " He fills out any more , we 'll have to put one of those garage doors on the front of this place just to let him in . " " He fills out any more , Fat Albert , Roseanne , Liz Taylor , and Sinbad gon na get together and start telling Jimmy Simmons weight jokes . " " He fills out any more- " " Hold up , Janine . You know what we 're doing right here ? " " What ? " " It 's called doing the dozens . ' " " That so . " " Uh-huh . White man on NPR yesterday , was talking about this book he wrote about African American culture ? Said that doing the dozens was this thing we been doin ' for generations . Called it the precursor of rap music . " " They got a name for it , for real ? And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not lying . " Strange buttoned his coat . " Get that bill out to Simmons , will you ? " " I handed it to him as he was going out the door . " " You 're always on it . I do n't know why I feel the need to remind you . " Strange nodded to one of two empty desks on either side of the room . " Where 's Ron at ? " " Trying to locate that debtor , the hustler took that woman off for two thousand dollars . " " Old lady lives down off Princeton ? " " Uh-huh . Where you headed ? " " Off to see Chris Wilson 's mom . " Strange walked toward the front door , his broad , muscled shoulders moving beneath the black leather , gray salted into his hair and closely cropped beard . He turned as his hand touched the doorknob . " You want something else ? " He had felt Janine 's eyes on his back . " No ... why ? " " You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wearin ' my beeper . " Strange stepped out onto 9th Street , a short commercial strip between Upshur and Kansas , one spit away from Georgia Avenue . He smiled , thinking of Janine . He had met her the first time at a club ten years earlier , and he had started hitting it then because both of them wanted him to , and because it was there for him to take . Janine had a son , Lionel , from a previous marriage , and this scared him . Hell , everything about commitment scared him , but being a father to a young man in this world , it scared him more than anything else . Despite his fears , their time together had seemed good for both Strange and Janine , and he had stayed with it , knowing that when it 's good it 's rare , and unless there 's a strong and immediate reason , you should never give it up . The affair went on steadily for several months . When he lost his office manager , he naturally thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a born organizer . They agreed that they would break off the relationship when she started working for him , and soon thereafter she went and got serious with another man . This was fine with him , a relief , as it had let him out the back door quietly , the way he always liked to go . That man exited Janine 's life shortly thereafter . Strange and Janine had recently started things up once again . Their relationship was n't exclusive , at least not for Strange . And the fact that he was her boss did n't bother either of them , in the ethical sense . Their lovemaking simply filled a need , and Strange had grown attached to the boy as well . Friends warned him about shitting on the dining room table , but he was genuinely fond of the woman , and she did make his nature rise after all the years . He liked to play with her , too , let her know that he knew that she was still interested . It kept things lively in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk for a moment and glanced up at the yellow sign over the door : " Strange Investigations , " the letters in half of both words enlarged inside the magnifying-glass illustration drawn across the lightbox . He loved that logo . It always made him feel something close to good when he looked up at that sign and saw his name . He had built this business by himself and done something positive in the place where he 'd come up . The kids in the neighborhood , they saw a black man turn the key on the front door every morning , and maybe it registered , put something in the back of their minds whether they realized it or not . He 'd kept the business going for twenty-five years now , and the bumps in the road had been just that . The business was who he was . All of him , and all his . STRANGE sat low behind the wheel of his white-over-black ' 89 Caprice , listening to a Blackbyrds tape coming from the box as he cruised south on Georgia Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maglite , a Rand McNally street atlas , and a Leatherman tool-in-one in a sheath that he often wore looped through his belt on the side of his hip . He wore a Buck knife the same way , all the time when he was on a job . A set of 10 X 50 binoculars , a cell phone , a voice-activated tape recorder , and extra batteries for his flashlights and camera were in the glove box , secured with a double lock . In the trunk of the car was a file carton containing data on his live cases . Also in the trunk was a steel Craftsman toolbox housing a heavy Maglite , a Canon AE-1 with a 500-millimeter lens , a pair of Russian-made NVD goggles , a 100-foot steel Craftsman tape measure , a roll of duct tape , and various Craftsman tools useful for engine and tire repair . When he could , Strange always bought Craftsman - the tools were guaranteed for life , and he tended to be hard on his equipment . He drove through Petworth . In the Park View @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Children 's Hospital and into Northeast , past Catholic U and down into Brookland . Strange parked in front of Leona Wilson 's modest brick home at 12th and Lawrence . He kept the motor running , waiting for the flute solo on " Walking in Rhythm " to end , though he could listen to it anytime . He 'd come here because he 'd promised Leona Wilson that he would , but he was n't in any hurry to make this call . Strange saw the curtain move in the bay window of Leona 's house . He cut the engine , got out of his car , locked it down , and walked up the concrete path to Leona 's front door . The door was already opening as he approached . " Mrs. Wilson , " he said , extending his hand . " Mr. Strange . "
