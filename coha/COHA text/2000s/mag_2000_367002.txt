GEEK GRUB Already a cult figure among geeks for his Dilbert comic strip about office life in a high-tech world , cartoonist Scott Adams has decided to capitalize on his fame by creating the Dilberito . It 's an all-in-one microwaveable meal-in-a-pocket aimed at the laptop-and-modem crowd .

Released last week , Netscape 6.0 is chockablock with handy features like instant messaging , an automatic language translator and an all-in-one mailbox that lets you view your AOL and Web mail in one place . But the coolest feature is My Sidebar , a window that opens next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock portfolio , customized news and weather . The browser will also be included in AOL 's upcoming web appliances . <P> THE SKY IS FALLING Iridium was the world 's first truly global communications system , providing wireless phone service anywhere on Earth via an orbiting network of satellites . When the service did n't catch on , the company went bankrupt , and Iridium announced it would allow all 66 satellites , launched at a cost of $5 billion , to burn up in the sky . Now a group of enterprising technophiles called Save Our Satellites is attempting to buy the satellites , on the ground that they constitute one of history 's greatest engineering feats .
