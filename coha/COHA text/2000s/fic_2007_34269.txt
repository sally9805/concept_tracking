Something woke her mid-dream . She did n't know whether it was the baby kicking , a gust of sea air tumbling in over the sill , surf breaking on the rocks , or even her mother 's voice , liquid in the waves , but as she lay there open-eyed in bed in the dark , the dream remained vivid . It was an old dream , and no less embarrassing to her for knowing the script . She was out in public , for all the world to see , lacking a vital piece of clothing . In this instance , it was her blouse . She had left home without it and now stood on the steps of her high school -- her high school -- wearing only a bra , and an old one at that . It did n't matter that she was sixteen years past graduation and knew none of the people on the steps . She was exposed and thoroughly mortified . And then -- this was a first -- there was her mother-in-law , standing off to the side , wearing a look of dismay and carrying -- bizarre -- the blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if , at that very moment , something else had n't diverted her thoughts . It was the sudden rush of fluid between her legs , like nothing she had ever felt before . Afraid to move , she whispered her husband 's name . When he did n't reply , she reached out , shook his arm , and said in full voice , " Hugh ? " He managed a gut-low " Mm ? " " We have to get up . " She felt him turn and stretch . " My water justbroke . " He sat up with a start . Leaning over her , his deep voice higher than normal , he asked , " Are you sure ? " " It keeps coming . But I 'm not due for two weeks . " " That 's okay , " he reassured her , " that 's okay . The baby is seven-plus pounds -- right in the middle of the full-term range . What time is it ? " " One-ten . " " Do n't move . I 'll get towels . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly because Hugh had studied every aspect of childbirth and knew what to do , and partly to avoid spreading the mess . As soon as he returned , though , she supported her belly and pushed herself up . Squinting against the sudden light of the lamp , she took one of the towels , slipped it between her legs , and shuffled into the bathroom . Hugh appeared seconds later , wide-eyed and pale in the vanity lights . " What do you see ? " he asked . " No blood . But it 's definitely the baby and not me . " " Do you feel anything ? " " Like terror ? " She was dead serious . As prepared as they were -- they had read dozens of books , talked with innumerable friends , grilled the doctor and her partners and her nurse-practitioner and the hospital personnel during a pre-admission tour -- the reality of the moment was something else . With childbirth suddenly and irrevocably imminent , Dana was scared . " Like contractions , " Hugh replied dryly . " No . Just a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does ' vague ' mean ? " " Subtle . " " Is it a contraction ? " " I do n't know . " " Does it come and go ? " " I do n't know , Hugh . Really . I just woke up and then there was a gush --  " She broke off , feeling something . " A cramp . " She held her breath , let it out , met his eyes . " Very mild . " " Cramp or contraction ? " " Contraction , " she decided , starting to tremble . They had waited so long for this . They were as ready as they would ever be . " Are you okay while I call the doctor ? " he asked . She nodded , knowing that if she had n't he would have brought the phone into the bathroom . But she was n't helpless . As doting as Hugh had been lately , she was an independent sort , and by design . She knew what it was to be wholly dependent on someone and then have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , while he phoned the doctor , she fit her big belly into her newest , largest warm-up suit , now lined with a pad from her post-delivery stash to catch amniotic fluid that continued to leak , and went down the hall to the baby 's room . She had barely turned on the light when he called . " Dee ? " " In here ! " Buttoning jeans , he appeared at the door . His dark hair was mussed , his eyes concerned . " " If those pains are less than ten minutes apart , we 're supposed to head to the hospital . Are you okay ? " She nodded . " Just want a last look . " " It 's perfect , honey , " he said as he stretched into an old navy tee shirt . " All set ? " " I do n't think they 're less than ten minutes apart . " " They will be by the time we 're halfway there . " " This is our first , " she argued . " First babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but every norm has exceptions . Indulge me on this , please ? " Taking his hand , she kissed his palm and pressed it to her neck . She needed another minute . She felt safe here , sheltered , happy . Of all the nurseries she had decorated for clients , this was her best -- four walls of a panoramic meadow , laced with flowers , tall grasses , sun-tipped trees . Everything was white , soft orange , and green , myriad shades of each highlighted with a splotch of blue in a flower or the sky . The feeling was one of a perfect world , gentle , harmonious , and safe . Self-sufficient she might be , but she had dreamed of a world like this from the moment she had dared to dream again . Hugh had grown up in a world like this . His childhood had been sheltered , his adolescence rich . His family had come to America on the Mayflower and been prominent players ever since . Four centuries of success had bred stability . Hugh might downplay the connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your parents expected pastel balloons on the wall , " she remarked , releasing his hand . " I 'm afraid I 've disappointed them . " " Not you , " he answered , " we , but it 's a moot point . This is n't my parents ' baby . " He made for the door . " I need shoes . " Moving aside knitting needles that held the top half of a moss green sleepsack , Dana carefully lowered herself into the Boston rocker . She had dragged it down from the attic , where Hugh hid most of his heirloom pieces , and while she had rescued others , now dispersed through the house , this was her favorite . Purchased in the 1840s by his great-great-grandfather , the eventual Civil War General , it had a spindle back and three-section rolled seat that was strikingly comfortable for something so old . Months ago , even before they had put the meadow on the walls , Dana had sanded the rocker 's chipped paint and restored it to gleaming perfection . And Hugh had let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more for having lived without it . That said , everything else was new , a family history that began here . The crib and its matching dresser were imported , but the rest , from the changing pad on top , to the hand-painted fabric framing the windows , to the mural , were custom done by her roster of artists . That roster , which included top-notch painters , carpenters , carpet and window people , also included her grandmother and herself . There was a throw over one end of the crib , made by her grandmother and mirroring the meadow mural ; a cashmere rabbit that Dana had knitted in every shade of orange ; a bunting , two sweaters , numerous hats , and a stack of carriage blankets -- and that did n't count the winter wool bunting in progress , which was mounded in a wicker basket at the foot of her chair , or the sleepsack she held in her hand . They had definitely gone overboard . Rocking slowly , she smiled as she remembered what had been here eight months before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home from work to find the room blanketed with tulips . Purple , yellow , white -- all were fresh enough to last for days . Hugh had planned this surprise with sheer pleasure , and Dana believed it had set the tone . There was magic in this room . There was warmth and love . There was security . Their baby would be happy here , she knew it would . Opening a hand on her stomach , she caressed the mound that was absurdly large in proportion to the rest of her . She could n't feel the baby move -- the poor little thing did n't have room to do much more than wiggle a finger or toe -- but Dana felt the tightening of muscles that would push her child into the world . Breathe slowly ... Hugh 's soothing baritone came back from their Lamaze classes . She was still breathing deeply well after the end of what was definitely another contraction when the slap of flip-flops announced his return . She grinned . " I 'm picturing the baby in this room . " But he was observant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? Are you timing them ? " " Not yet . They 're too far apart . I 'm trying to distract myself by thinking happy thoughts . Remember the first time I saw your house ? " It was the right question . Smiling , he leaned against the doorjamb . " Sure do . You were wearing neon green . " " It was n't neon , it was lime , and you did n't know what the piece was . " " I knew what it was . I just did n't know what it was called . " " It was called a sweater . " His eyes held hers . " Laugh if you want -- you do every time -- -but that sweater was more angular and asymmetrical than anything I 'd ever seen . " " Modular . " " Modular , " he repeated , pushing off from the jamb . " Knit in cashmere and silk -- all of which comes easily to me now , but back then , what did I know ? " He put both hands on the arms of the rocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others were out of the running the minute you walked in my door . I did n't know about yarn , did n't know about color , did n't know about whether you were any kind of decorator , except that David loved what you did for his house . But we 're playing with fire , dear heart . David will kill me if I do n't get you to the hospital in time . I 'm sure he 's seen the lights . " David Johnson lived next door . He was an orthopedic surgeon and divorced . Dana was always trying to set him up , but he always complained , saying that none of the women were her . " David wo n't see the lights , " she insisted now . " He 'll be asleep . " Placing her knitting on the basket , Hugh hoisted her -- gently -- to her feet . " How do you feel ? " " Excited . You ? " " Antsy . " He slid an arm around her waist , or thereabouts , but when he saw from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Definitely less than ten minutes . What , barely five ? " She did n't argue , just concentrated on slowly exhaling until the pain passed . " There , " she said . " Okay -- boy or girl -- last chance to guess . " " Either one is great , but we ca n't just hang out here , Dee , " he warned . " We have to get to the hospital . " He tried to steer her toward the hall . " I 'm not ready . " " After nine months ? " Fearful , she put her hand on his chest . " What if something goes wrong ? " He grinned and covered her hand . " Nothing will go wrong . This is my lucky tee shirt . I 've worn it through every Super Bowl the Patriots have won and through the World Series with the Red Sox . " " I 'm serious . " " So am I , " he said , all confidence . " We 've had tests . The baby 's healthy . You 're healthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right position . We have the best obstetrician and the best hospital --  " " I mean later . What if there 's a problem , like when the baby is three ? Or seven ? Or when it 's a teenager , you know , like the problems the Millers have with their son ? " " We are n't the Millers . " " But it 's the big picture , Hugh . " She was thinking of the dream she 'd had prior to waking up . No mystery , that dream . It was about her fear of being found lacking . " What if we are n't as good at parenting as we think we 'll be ? " " Now , there 's a moot point . A little late to be thinking of it . " " Do you realize what we 're getting into ? " " Of course not , " he said . " But we want this baby . Come on , sweetie . We have to leave . " Dana insisted on returning to the master bath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brushed her hair . Turning sideways for a last look , she studied her body 's profile . Yes , she preferred being slim -- yes , she was tired of hauling around thirty extra pounds -- yes , she was dying to wear jeans and a tee shirt again . But being pregnant was special . " Dana , " Hugh said impatiently . " Please . " She let him guide her down the hall , past the nursery again and toward the stairs . In architectural circles , the house was considered a Newport cottage , though " cottage " downplayed its grandness . Built in a U that faced the sea , with multiple pairs of French doors opening to a canopied patio , a large swath of soft grass , and a border of beach roses that overlooked the surf , it was a vision of corbels , columns , white trim and shingles gently grayed by the salt air . One wing held the living room , dining room , and library : the other , the kitchen and family room . The master bedroom and nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two additional bedrooms in the other . The dormered attic housed an office , complete with a balcony . Every room in the house , with the sole exception of the first-floor powder room , had a window facing the sea . It was Dana 's dream house . She had fallen in love with it on sight . More than once , she had told Hugh that even if he had turned into a frog with their first kiss , she would have married him for the house . Now , approaching the nearer of two staircases that descended symmetrically to the front hall , she asked , " What if it 's a girl ? " " I 'll love a girl . " " But you want a boy deep down , I know you do , Hugh . It 's that family name . You want a little Hugh Ames Clarke . " " I 'd be just as happy with Elizabeth Ames Clarke , as long as I do n't have to deliver her myself . Careful here , " he said as they started down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first turn . The contraction was stronger this time . She was prepared for pain , but the fact of it was something else . " Can I do this ? " she asked , shaking noticeably as she clung to his arm . He held her more tightly . " You ? In a minute . " Hugh had trusted her right from the start . It was one of the things she loved . He had n't hesitated when she suggested barnboard for the floor of his otherwise modern kitchen or , later , when she insisted that he hang his family portraits -- large , dark oil paintings of Clarkes with broad brows , square jaws , and straight lips -- in the living room , though he would have gladly left them packed away in the attic . He took his heritage for granted . No , it was more than that . He rebelled against his father 's obsession with heritage , said that it embarrassed him . Dana must have convinced him that he was a successful figure in his own right , because he had let her hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical depth . She had splashed the large leather furniture with wildly textured pillows , and Hugh liked that , too . He had said he wanted comfort , not stuffiness . Butter-soft leather and a riot of nubby silk and chenille offered that . He had also said he did not like the settee that had belonged to his great-grandfather because it was stern , but he gave her wiggle room there , too . She had the oak of that settee restored , the seat recaned , and cushions and a throw designed to soften the look .
