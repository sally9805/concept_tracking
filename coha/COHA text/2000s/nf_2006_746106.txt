AIBS/BCSS/NESCent Cosponsor Evolution Symposium <p> On 14 October 2006 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the annual conference of the National Association of Biology Teachers in Albuquerque , New Mexico . The symposture , titled " Macroevolution : Evolution above the Species Level , " drew over 200 high school and college faculty members . <p> Presentations in the symposium provided current information about macro-evolutionary processes , the distinctions between and the interactions of micro-and macroevolution , the development and evolution of " key innovations " and major lineages of organisms , and the evidence for these processes . <p> The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center ( NESCent ) , one of the syposium cosponsors , developed a CD-ROM of resource materials for teaching , which is available online at no cost ( http : **35;3278;TOOLONG ) . NESCent staff distributed 500 copies of the CD-ROM during the meeting . <p> The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study , another cosponsor , ran education specific sessions during the day . PowerPoint presentations will be posted soon , along with audio files of the speakers ' talks , on the AIBS Web site : **56;3315;TOOLONG . <p> Information about past and future evolution symposia is available at **29;3373;TOOLONG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On 13 October 2006 , Susan Musante , director of the AIBS Education and Outreach Program , and Janet Powell , associate director and chief science education officer at the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study , presented the 2006 NABT ( National Association of Biology Teachers ) Evolution Education Award to Donald Cronkite . The ceremony took place during the 2006 NABT annual conference . <p> Cronkite teaches core courses on evolutionary biology , embryology , and the history of biology ; he also teaches annual seminars on " special topics in evolutionary biology , " each of which focuses oil a specific aspect of evolution . His work in promoting the understanding of evolutionary biology extends beyond the college classroom . He has organized conferences and workshops for high school biology teachers , and has taken an active role in promoting an understanding of science and science education in his community . <p> In his letter nominating Cronkite , Hope College Provost James N. Boelkins said , " He is a scholar who writes and presents material relevant to his life-long interest in biology and the topic of evolution . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic of creation and evolution with sensitivity to other viewpoints and with integrity to scientific knowledge . " AIBS Comments on Ocean Research Plan <p> On 20 October 2006 , AIBS submitted comments on " Charting the Course for Ocean Science in the United States : Research Priorities for the Next Decade , " a draft document issued by the National Science and Technology Council Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology . <p> An excerpt of the AIBS comments follows : <p> The draft report focuses needed attention on a number of important research topics . For example , a concerted national research effort addressing the stewardship of our natural and cultural ocean resources , better understanding system resilience to natural events , improving ecosystem health , and better understanding the link between ocean , lake and coastal systems and human health are all timely research arenas that warrant a robust and sustained federal investment . However , a number of significant issues do not , at the surface , appear to have been addressed in the report . Thus , these comments are intended to raise these issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science and Technology ( ISOST ) . <p> A significant concern with the draft report is that it flails to articulate the funding that will be sought to achieve the proposed goals . A number of the research activities proposed are already initiatives at various federal agencies , yet progress has been slow due to what some consider inadequate and unpredictable funding . A realistic budget request and multiyear commitment to federal research program managers would seem to be a central element necessary for the ultimate success of the JSOST research plan . <p> Another concern with the draft report is the lack of attention given In international collaboration . Effective and high-impact research on deep ocean systems , the Great Lakes , or coastal ecosystems requires effective and strategic international collaboration . The final report would be greatly improved if it included a framework for supporting international research partnerships and collaborative agreements . <p> Additionally , significant research questions about ocean , Great Lakes , and coastal ecosystem biodiversity remain unanswered . It is important that the final report fully reflect these research questions and needs . Scientists must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to new tools , such as the ocean observing system , the report should ensure that existing components of our research infrastructure are appropriately addressed . Research vessels , marine laboratories and field stations , natural science collections , and the human capital that utilize these facilities are all necessary to address the research agenda proposed in the draft report . In many cases , however , these science facilities require new investments to maintain their physical structures and construct the infrastructure , such as cyber infrastructure , that will make it possible to serve scientific research into the future . In each of the past two years , the research and development priorities memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy ( OSTP ) has articulated the need to prioritize federal object-based scientific collections . AIBS at the 2006 SACNAS Conference <p> AIBS , together with the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center , organized a session entitled " Exploring Careers in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology " at the annual meeting of the Society for the Advancement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2006 in Tampa , Florida .

The effort focused on preparing five major project documents for delivery to the National Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of NEON by an NSF panel the week of 6 November . <p> The documents were ( I ) the Integrated Science and Education Plan ( ISEP ) , which sets forth the NEON vision ; ( 2 ) the Networking and Informatics Baseline Design , which describes the cyberinfrastructure that will support and enable NEON ; ( 3 ) the Preliminary Project Execution Plan , a document that links the NEON conceptual design with methods for deploying integrated instruments , experiments , facilities , and cyberinfrastructure ; ( 4 ) the Project Development Plan , the roadmap that defines the scope of work and the strategy that will take NEON to the construction phase ; and ( 5 ) the Cost Book . <p> The NEON Project Office received expert input on the ISEP from a NEON writing subcommittee , and a great deal of useful comment on the document from the ecological community . The revised draft ( available at www.neoninc.org ) is much improved as a result . <p> In addition , in October NEON staff posted a sixth document , the Request for Information ( RFI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information from the environmental science community to further refine the design and specifications of NEON . Respondents to the RFI have an opportunity to identify national-and multiregional-scale scientific questions that require NEON observational and cyberinfrastructure resources ; questions that may also require continental scale manipulative experiments ; locations of core wildland sites and experiments ; and a continental-scale research gradient . <p> Electronic responses to the RFI are due at the NEON Project Office by 5 January 2007 . An NSF selected scientific and technical committee will review the responses on their scientific merit , logistical issues , and other factors . NEON , Inc. , will then consider the recommendations and use them to develop a final integrated , site-specific plan for deploying NEON infrastructure . <p> On 1 November , the NEON Project Office hosted an RFI question-and-answer session at the American Society of Association Executives conference center in Washington , DC , More than 50 individuals registered for the event , participating either in person or via a live Webcast . They received clarifications about the requirements from NEON board chair lira MacMahon and Project Office administrative director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEON , Inc. , Web site ( www.neoninc.org ) for details . <p> NEON staffer Dean Johnson ( left ) describes NEON science and infrastructure to Donald H.
