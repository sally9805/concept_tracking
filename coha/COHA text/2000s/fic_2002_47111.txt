Herewith the wise Mr. Disch-he who knows from brave toasters , not to mention biblical tongues-treats our young millennium to three parables that will help you learn about the birds , if not the bees . <p> I THE NAMING OF THE BIRDS BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN there were very few words , and for a good reason . There was nothing to look at , nothing to listen to , nothing to talk about . Gradually things improved . God created light , so you could see what was there beyond the darkness on the face of the deep . The light was called Day and the darkness , which was now limited to the hours after six o'clock , was called Night . Once there was some light it became obvious just how big a mess the universe was in , with no clear distinction between up and down , or left and right . The sky and the sea and the land were all jumbled up in one big smoosh . God , who is basically very neat , did n't like that at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where there would be room for the Sun and the Moon and the stars , water , and land . Things started to make sense after that . Then God filled the oceans and rivers and other bodies of water with all kinds of fish , including whales , although whales are n't fish , strictly speaking , but mammals like us . And he made birds to fly around in the sky . Then came the animals , lots of them , more than you 'll ever see in any zoo . Most of the animals had legs , but there were some without , and all of them - the fish , the birds , the animals - were able to make more creatures just like themselves , which is what God had told them to do : Multiply . So all the animals paired up . Each pair of two animals multiplied themselves , so then there were four , and those four multiplied themselves , and there were eight , because two times four is eight , and so on , until in a very short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years - all the continents and islands and peninsulas were filled with animals , and likewise the oceans and lakes with fish , and the air with birds . Millions and billions of them all over the place - and none of them had names ! Not just personal names , such as your dog or cat might have Browny , or Princess , or Catamaran - but the basic name that explains what kind of animal each one is , like dog or cat or rhinoceros . You could n't point at a cow out in the field and say , " Look at that cow , " because the word " cow , " which we all take for granted , just did n't exist . For the animals themselves that might not have mattered so much , since animals do n't talk to each other , except with snarls and barks and whines , and fish are even less given to conversation , except for whales , who do talk to each other and who , unlike everyone else in the ocean , did have their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so an exception to the rule and not really part of this story . But the birds did n't have names , and birds can be very talkative , so they wanted names . Nice names that would set one flock apart from the others . Names they could preen like their feathers . Names that would make someone stop and think and maybe smile and feel friendly toward the bird that bore such a sweet name . And also , thinking ahead ( for birds , because they can fly , often see into the future ) , names that might be used at some later time in a poem or a song . For just the way that flowers love to be in pictures , birds love to be in songs . Having foreseen the possibility of poetry , the birds were not altogether surprised when God formed Adam out of the dust of the Earth and breathed some life into him . He was a person , and it would be people like him who would someday write the poems the birds might appear in . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to go to school . He was born a grownup , with no one to tell him when to get up or to go to bed , or what to eat for breakfast or dinner , except for one kind of fruit that he had to avoid . But that is a story all on its own , which we wo n't go into here . This story is about how Adam named all the birds in the Garden of Eden , where he lived at that time . Naming the animals and birds was the first job that God asked Adam to do , and he had to do it entirely on his own , because Eve , who would later be his wife , did n't exist yet . He had no one he could talk with but God himself , and God said the naming would be up to Adam entirely . " There they are , " said God , with a broad gesture toward the field full of beasts that had assembled for their naming . " Name them . " " Anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make each name appropriate . The names will stick , and all these animals will have to live with the names you give them for hundreds of years . " " Okay , " said Adam . He looked at the animals who had come nearest to where he and God were standing . " That 's a dog . And that 's a cat . And that little one is a mouse . " He noticed that there was a pair of them , and that they were both cute little things , so he made a correction : " Two mice . " God smiled at the embellishment , and Adam , encouraged , turned toward the largest animals close at hand , and said , " That 's an ox , and they are oxen . " The oxen looked at each other askance and lowered their heads , as though embarrassed . It was too late for Adam to change his mind , but after that he was more sparing in meting out peculiar plurals . There were even more kinds of animals then than there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great flood God had planned for the future , as a punishment for all the violence in the world . So Adam had to name all the different kinds of dinosaurs , as well as shaggy mammoths and saber-tooth tigers and other mammals now extinct . It took along time to take care of all the animals , and Adam came up with some quite fanciful names once he got going . There was the pika and the platypus , the zebu and the stoat . The chameleon and the anaconda . The panda and the peccary , and all kinds of great names for the various tribes of apes and monkeys . The wallaby . The walrus . The yak . The gnu was the very last animal to be named , and when he 'd named the gnu , and the field was empty at last of all the assembled beasts except for the dog , who kept bringing Adam a slobbery old stick , wanting him to toss it - Adam thought , " I could use a day of rest myself . " God could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are next . " The minute God said that the sky filled with birds of all shapes and colors and sizes , all of them anxious to be named and to begin to have their own unique identities the way the animals now did . From their aerial vantage they could see mountain goats springing from crag to crag , and sloths drooping from treelimbs like clothes on a clothesline , and squirrels scampering across the lawns of Eden . Adam had shown a real talent for naming , because all the animals behaved just the way you 'd expect them to if you thought about their names a little while . The names fit them like gloves , and that 's what the birds wanted for themselves . A pretty plump bird with eggshell-colored feathers and bright pink eyes alighted on an olive branch nearby Adam . It tilted its head to the side , gave a little flutter to its feathers , and said , " Coo ? Coo ? " " You 'd like a name , is that it ? " said Adam , for in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could understand what the birds meant with all their tweets and cheeps and booty-hoos . So Adam knew that " Coo ? Coo ? " was to be understood as " Who ? Who will we be ? " We , meaning me and the Mrs. " Coombe ! " said Adam cheerily . " How would you like to be a coombe ? " The bird glared at Adam and lifted the ruff of feathers about its neck in a manner that left no doubt as to its refusal . It gave no reason . Birds often do n't give their reason . They just fly off , and that 's that . Which is what this bird did . All the birds who 'd been close by when Adam made his suggestion had fluttered off in different directions , with the exception of a large , mostly black bird with a neck bent over like the handle of a cane and his beak bent the same way . Large as he was , he seemed rather sickly , and the reason for that was that he had n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the family of scavengers who live on the flesh of dead animals , and so far death did not exist in Eden , and the scavengers were all quite hungry and dispirited , scraping along on roots and berries , a diet for which they were not well adapted . " Coombe ? " Adam tried again . " Do you think that 's a name you might like ? " The black bird shook its head sadly , and went " Grawk ! " by which it meant to say , No . No , it did not want a name that rhymed with tomb and doom and gloom . For in due course , when people began to write poetry , imagine what it would be like to be the first bird to spring to mind when a poet began to think of death . " 0 coombe , " the poet would write , " thou bird of doom that hast perched here on the tomb of the dead Lenore . Nevermore shall I see her again , 0 coombe ! Nevermore ! " Adam could understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other birds would feel the same way about being called a coombe , so even though it had a nice ring to it , he knew it would n't do for any of the birds , and that 's how a coombe came to be a deep narrow valley on the side of a hill , and then only in certain lonely parts of Wales . " Grawk ! " said the black bird , with a different emphasis , and this time what it meant was , Ca n't you think of something with more positive associations ? Perhaps to the arts . To painting , or violin concertos , or ballet ? None of those arts had been invented yet , but Adam , like the birds about him , had a certain prophetic streak , and he knew what this bird would like to rhyme with even if he did n't know what Culture was . " Vulture ! " he said . " How would you like to be a vulture ? " The vulture lifted its head , its eyes aglow with a new self-esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate , close by , said " Grawk ! " as well , and off the two of them flew to a tall yew tree where they settled down to wait for the arrival of death and their first good meal ever . Not all the birds were so particular . Most of them seemed happy to accept the first name that came to Adam 's mind . The booby raised no objection to being a booby , nor the auk to being an auk . And who would not like to be a chickadee or a bobolink , a cormorant or a cockatoo ? Oh , there were many birds with plainer names than that , wrens and sparrows and crows and jays , but even they could rhyme to something agreeable . A sparrow could speed through the air like an arrow . A wren could say Amen and then say it again , and beyond that it would rhyme to every kind of hen . Crows could form rows on telephone lines and screech and squawk from dawn till dusk , supposing all the while it was music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larks themselves , there was a song in store for them that said it all . It is in a play by William Shakespeare , called Cymbeline , and it begins like this : " Hark ! hark ! the lark at heaven 's gate sings . " The birds that Adam named that day would pop up in thousands of songs in the course of time . Not only " Listen to the Mockingbird " but " Mockingbird Hill " as well . There are many good songs about robins , and one about wild geese that is really inspirational . It begins " I must go where the wild goose goes , " and it 's about how exciting it is always to be traveling to strange places , the way geese do . There are so many songs about bluebirds the list would fill the page of a newspaper , and you would still have to say et cetera . But there is one bird who can be found in even more poems than the robin or the bluebird , and that is the bird that first flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as a coombe . Now , after all the other birds had been named , those two were back with their ruffled feathers and reproachful Coos , as though to say , Have you forgotten us ? Are we to have no name ? Adam looked at God , and God looked at Adam , and all at once he knew the perfect name for the two birds with their gray feathers and softly purring song . " You 're doves ! " he announced . At once their breasts swelled with pride , for they could hear , prophetically , their new name echoing down through the centuries in thousands of poems and songs . Oh , for the wings , for the wings of a dove ! On the wings of a snow-white dove ! And then , where it says in the Psalms in the Bible : " Ye shall be as the wings of a dove that is covered with silver wings , and her feathers like gold . " Or think of what Mercutio says in Romeo and Juliet : " Speak but one rhyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Couple but " dove " and love . " " For that , of course , is why the doves were so happy with the name that Adam had found them . For all eternity they 'd be the only birds to rhyme with love and with the heavens above . Their immortality was a sure thing . II A CASE OF CHILD ABUSE " What can I tell you ? " says Sarah mournfully . " He hears voices . And not just voices like you or I might hear : Do n't do that , dumkopf ! " or Maybe tomorrow . " No , the voice he hears is nothing less than the Lord God Almighty 's . " Abraham , " this voice tells him , " behold , here I am . " Of course , there 's nothing there to behold , it 's a voice inside his head , but that did n't stop him . They get into a discussion , and this Jehovah voice tells him he 's got to abduct our only son , Isaac - " She turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 's . " The stenographer nods . Sarah continues : " If I told you how old I was when I had that kid , you would n't believe me . Anyhow , never mind about that . So , he takes Isaac , who 's still no more than a baby - he wets his bed , he cries all night with the teething , he should n't even be out of the tent - and he takes him off to the land of Moriah , which is to hell and gone , but I guess you know that . " " Yes , ma'am , " says the police inspector . " That 's where he was arrested . " " You know , I still ca n't believe it , " says Sarah , shaking her head . " Why would he do such a thing ? His own son . His only son . I mean , yes , he says God told him to , so you could say that 's the reason he did it . But you know what I think ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that . I told you already what he did with the kid the minute he was born . I said , Abe , honey , what do you think you 're doing with that knife ? " And he says , The kid 's got to be circumcised . I 've discussed this already with God . " I swear I thought at first he 'd cut his little weenie clean off . I guess I should have got the message then . You 've married a lunatic , honey . Take the baby and run . But what could I do ? Go to my father ? After I 'd eloped and stolen the little clay tchotchkes that were his gods ? Not likely . All men are lunatics , that 's my theory , especially when it comes to them and their gods . I was stuck with Abraham . He was " my man , as the song says . " " Had he ever threatened you ? " asks the police inspector . " Never , " says Sarah . " Usually he 's sweet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still , um .... " The inspector conveys what he means by lowering his eyes . " Sex , you mean ? Not that much , at our age . After you get to be a hundred , the urge diminishes . As for my sister - he 's married to her , too , you know - you 'll have to ask her yourself , but I do n't think he sees that much of Leah anymore , either . Our handmaidens , now that 's another matter . He 's got a thing for handmaidens . Which I , personally , have always counted a blessing . " The stenographer signals for Sarah to pause until she 's caught up with her . Then , when the stenographer has given her a go-ahead , Sarah asks the inspector , " What 's going to happen ? Is this going to go to court , or what ? I 'll tell you right now , I could n't say these things in front of a lot of people . " " No , " says the inspector , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Your husband has influential friends . I think the whole matter will be settled out of court . " " Temporary insanity ? " The inspector nods . " There 's nothing temporary about it . Who knows what this Jehovah 's going to tell him he wants for his next burnt offering ? I 'll tell you quite honestly , I do n't feel safe around the man anymore . " " I 'm afraid there 's nothing we can do about that , ma'am . According to the law , you are your husband 's chattel . And so is the kid . That 's why we ca n't press charges . If it had been someone else 's kid , we could nail him . " " What 's the point of having laws if they ca n't protect you ? " Sarah grumbles . " Good question , " says the police inspector , as he gets up off the rug and smooths out the wrinkles in his burnoose . " Maybe you should have your husband ask Jehovah . " And he winks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the patrolmen , " You can send the kid in now . " Little Isaac runs into the tent , and Sarah spreads open her arms . For a while it 's all hugs and tears , and then Sarah asks , " So where 's your father ? " Isaac looks down at the rug . " I do n't know , Mamma ... I think he 's with the sheep . " She waits . He squirms . " Or maybe with Leah . " Sarah raises her eyes to heaven , more for the stenographer 's sake than the police inspector 's . " Your husband was released earlier , ma'am , " says the inspector . " But he told us to tell you he 'd be home for his dinner at the usual time . And he asked us to give you this . He hands her a string satchel , and then excuses himself , leaving Sarah alone with Isaac and the stenographer . Sarah looks inside the satchel and announces , " Lamb chops . " Isaac perks up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks up at the stenographer . " You know what this is , do n't you . It 's what 's left over from the burnt offering . He probably took the haunch over to Leah . Waste not , want not , that 's my Abraham . " " So what else is new , " says the stenographer . " We get this sort of thing happening every week . If it is n't Jehovah , it 's Moloch . If it is n't Moloch , it 's Baal . They 're all alike : Bring me your first-born son and set him on my altar . " You 're lucky your Jehovah changed his mind at the last minute . Not all of those gods do . " Sarah sighs . " You like lamb chops ? " she asks the stenographer . " It looks like there 's more than enough . " " Thank you , but I ca n't , " says the stenographer . " I 'm vegetarian . " III JAHWEH 'S WIFE Moses did not like women . Partly this was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partly from the trauma of abandonment in infancy . His mother could never leave off with the bulrushes , and of course the way she told the story it was all Pharaoh 's fault for telling the midwives , Shiphrah and Puah , who got credit for contravening the Pharaoh 's cruel orders . But his mother and those midwives were thick as thieves , and you do n't suppose the little basket they had set him afloat in had anything to do with infant sacrifice and luck in the lottery ? Oh no , they were saving his life , assisted by yet another female paragon , no less than Pharaoh 's daughter . Tell me another ! Women ! All of them worshipped idols , and all their idols had great drooping breasts and swollen stomachs by way of reminding anyone who might have forgotten where babies come from and what they drink that keeps them alive . Moses hated idols , any idols at all , male as much as female , animal , mineral , and vegetable , because there was always something the idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and always it turned out to be exactly what his mother wanted him to do - or latter on , what his wife Zipporah wanted . He could remember watching old Puah cavorting in front of some cow of a goddess and thinking how someday he would smash all the women 's idols and start a new religion just for guys , and no one would be allowed to eat snails ever again ( his mother loved snails ) or even spare ribs . Especially spare ribs ! His mother went into ecstasies every year at the Cairo Spare Rib Festival - and afterward , talk about unclean ! For many years , even after he 'd led the Jews out of bondage and started bringing down Jahweh 's laws from the mountaintop where he and the Lord his God got together , Moses felt guilty for some of the laws he laid down . Not so much the busywork laws concerning the decoration of the temple with red lambswool and badger skins and shittim wood , and not even the tough laws - eye for an eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a useful deterrent against crime . It was the laws governing leprosy , which were complicated and strict , that he sometimes regretted . Not that there should n't be such laws , but perhaps they were harsher than need be , since he 'd framed them at a time when he was feeling miffed with his mother , who was getting senile and would go off every weekend whoring after false gods . She would bow down to graven images and commit abominations and eat snails , so something really had to be done . So Aaron , who was a high priest by then , had declared their mother a leper . But he 'd also rigged the test , and maybe that had been going too far . Or maybe the fault was with Moses 's laws concerning leprosy . It was a chicken-or-the-egg situation . Years later , when he was writing the story of his life and making a digest of the laws , he left out those details about his mother , and many of the stories about Zipporah , as well . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a brief mention of her " accident " on the way to Egypt , when she 'd bloodied his best robe in the process of cutting their younger son 's foreskin with a sharp stone . The stains never did come out , and it was n't as though the boy had n't been circumcised already . Zipporah just got excited , sometimes , with a sharp stone in her hand . Her father Jethro had been crazy the same way . Another subject Moses avoided in the Pentateuch was the vexed relationship between Jahweh and his wife Jaweenah . As a result of Moses 's reticence , many of Jahweh 's actions may strike readers of Genesis as irrational and unmotivated , since the book omits mention of the demands Jaweenah made upon her husband . Like Fricka , the spouse of another Divine Patriarch , Jaweenah could be a jealous and vindictive deity , and her caprices often dictated her husband 's actions . Did Fricka insist that Wotan assist in the slaughter of his bastard son and spoiled darling Siegmund ? Was she behind the years-long coma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these matters is clear , just as it was Jaweenah who insisted that the child Isaac be executed by his own doting father as punishment for the child 's having trespassed into Jaweenah 's magic cloud-garden , where he 'd picked her invisible violets . Only at the last moment had the henpecked Divinity rebel against his spouse 's stem decree and provide Abraham with a ram to serve as a burnt offering in his son 's stead . If Jaweenah had had her way .... Then there was the little matter of Gomorrah , a city that had been devoted to the worship of Jaweenah in her character as protectress of ovens and kilns . Gomorrah had been filled with temples where Jaweenah 's priestesses baked firstborn male offerings in hollow brazen idols representing the goddess with the attributes of a male baker , including a white cap and large potholders . The powdered remains of children baked in this way were thought to secure their parents against sterility and impotence . Jahweh tried to reason with his wife concerning the propriety of her appearing in public dressed in male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People in those days went through a lot of firstborns : there were n't other forms of contraception . But Jaweenah would n't listen to reason , and finally Jahweh realized he was wasting his breath and rained down fire and brimstone on the offending city while his wife was away on a visit to the gods of Olympus . When Jaweenah returned there was hell to pay . She stormed about the mountaintop , hurling thunderbolts and spewing lava and afflicting half her husband 's Chosen People with scabs and sores in those places it is most embarrassing to scratch . jahweh apologized and promised to have another city built for her particular worship , if only she would put by her baker 's hat and the potholders , which it was unbecoming a woman to wear . She refused . He insisted . She said , " Well , then , there are other gods ...... Those were Jaweenah 's last words . Jahweh pronounced his spouse 's doom . Her breasts withered and fell to the ground like petals from a fruit tree . When she opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her tongue began to smoke . In less than a minute Jaweenah was a heap of ashes at her husband 's feet . Jahweh scattered the ashes with a breath . After he 'd told Moses this story , Jahweh had misgivings . " On the whole , I wonder if it might not be better to leave all this out of the book . People could get the wrong idea as to proper behavior in a domestic crisis . Stoning adulteresses is one thing , but I may have gone too far . It 's that dam temper of mine . When I wax wroth .... " " But what will I tell people when they ask about your wife ? " " Say I was never married , Say I 'm the only god there ever was , the Alpha and Omega . Period . " " But the other major deities all have wives . " " There are no other deities , Moses . How many times do I have to tell YOU . " " Yes , Lord , " said Moses , happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why to this very day we worship One God , who is male and unmarried .
