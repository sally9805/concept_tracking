<p> CHICAGO OPERA THEATER IN ' IL VIAGGIO A REIMS ' <p> When : 7:30 p.m . Wednesday , Friday , May 27 and 29 ; 3 p.m . May 23 <p> Where : Harris Theater for Music and Dance , 205 E. Randolph <p> Tickets : $30-$97 <p> Call : 312-704-8414 <p> Puccini wrote an opera set in Gold Rush-era California , " The Girl of the Golden West . " At one point , the hard-bitten miners and desperados in the Polka saloon sing a tender chorus about how they miss their mamas back home . <p> In " Manon , " Massenet banishes his dying heroine to die in a vast desert somewhere outside New Orleans . Geography was evidently not the 19th century French composer 's strong suit . <p> Bizarre reflections of American life are not unheard of in the opera world . But now comes " Il viaggio a Reims , " a Rossini opera set in Chicago . Chicago ? Well , not exactly . <p> Chicago Opera Theater closes its 2004 season with the local premiere of a reconstruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rheims ) , " an opera that Rossini wrote in 1825 in honor of the coronation of Charles X. Unfortunately , Charles became one of France 's more forgettable monarchs , and an opera extolling his virtues , even the hugely popular , tune-filled comic farce that " Il viaggio " turned out to be , had a limited shelf life . <p> Ever a practical man of the theater , Rossini a few years later lifted half of the music of " Il viaggio " for another , more durable opera , " Le comte Ory " and consigned most of the rest of " Il viaggio " to long-term storage . There it moldered for much of the next century-and-a-half . <p> In the late 1970s , thanks to the detective work of Philip Gossett , the redoubtable University of Chicago music scholar and Rossini and Verdi specialist , and some colleagues , " Il viaggio " was reassembled . <p> The reconstructed tale of a motley band of travelers vainly trying to get to Rheims for Charles X 's coronation had its modern premiere in 1984 under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birthplace . The COT version , conducted by Raymond Leppard and directed by Christopher Cowell , will update the action to the American Civil War . Frustrated by the kinds of snafus that can bedevil travelers whether moving by stagecoach or jet plane , COT 's ragtag characters are trying to get from the Old West to Washington , D.C. , for Abraham Lincoln 's second inaugural in 1864 . By the opera 's end , they are happy to be on their way to Chicago to catch up with the president at a post-inaugural party . ( It was in Chicago that Lincoln received his first nomination for president , during the 1860 Republican National Convention . ) <p> " It 's a perfectly stupid , silly plot , " said Leppard blithely about Rossini 's original . " Who cares about Charles X , the worst French king who ever was and who did n't last long , either ? You ca n't do it like that . So we 've moved it to the West and Midwest , and we have n't had to alter anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the world , and he may very well have come back for a visit . " <p> Gossett , who fits no one 's stereotype of a staid music scholar , tells the tale of reconstructing " Il viaggio " with all the flair of a John Grisham novel , involving urgent letters from dogged graduate students who have stumbled across musical gold and cryptic hints from Italian librarians about mysterious treasures buried deep in their storage cabinets . <p> " We knew Rossini wrote ' Il viaggio ' to be performed when the king returned to Paris from Rheims after the coronation , " Gossett said . " We also knew it was an enormous success . We have the original printed libretto ; we have always had all the words . But a complete score did n't exist per se . " <p> The four initial performances of " Il viaggio " in Paris were lavishly produced , with some of the era 's finest singers and musicians , but nevertheless , the work soon disappeared . The opera surfaced briefly in 1848 , a dangerous year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution . Somewhat rewritten and titled " Andremo a Parigi ? ( " Shall we go to Paris ? " ) , the opera featured travelers trying to get to Paris to see the insurgents ' famous barricades . In 1854 , yet another version based on Rossini 's original was presented in Vienna as " Il viaggio a Vienna , " part of the festivities for a royal wedding . <p> Beyond that , however , Rossini 's original had been scattered to the four winds . <p> " This was a work absolutely tied to a particular occasion , " Gossett said . " It was written for the coronation of the king . There is n't any plot in a conventional sense . Rossini knew it was n't a piece that had legs in his world . " <p> Gossett and several colleagues began thinking seriously about reassembling " Il viaggio " in the mid-1970s when he was supervising a complete critical edition of Rossini 's operas . Using the most thorough methods of modern scholarship , the idea was to produce authoritative editions of every Rossini opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " In the early 1970s , we still had very little information about ' Il viaggio , " Gossett said . " In 1976 , one of my students , Elizabeth Bartlet , was in Paris working on a dissertation about another composer . She is a persistent type , and she wanted to look at uncataloged material . She insisted and insisted and insisted , and finally they let her go down to where this material was located . She noticed that there were whole pieces of stuff with ' Il viaggio a Reims ' written on them . " <p> Bartlet , who would eventually edit the critical edition of Rossini 's " William Tell , " wrote to Gossett about her find and asked for advice . " I told her to get it microfilmed  --  we would pay anything  --  and send it to me as quickly as she could . " <p> The cache included a few vocal parts and a few orchestral parts used for the 1848 " Andremo a Parigi ? " <p> " It was n't a complete score , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was n't the same work , but it was clearly based on ' Il viaggio . ' For the first time , we had a little glimpse of what this thing could have been . Some of it was gorgeous stuff . " <p> In 1978 , Gossett was working in the main music conservatory library in Rome , where he had studied scores regularly since 1966 . A librarian who knew him well mentioned some materials that he might be interested in . <p> " She brings out a stack of manuscripts on the cover of which , in Rossini 's hand , is ' Il viaggio a Reims , ' " Gossett said . Though many of its pages were out of order , and it somehow had not been listed in the library 's official catalog , the manuscript was an incomplete version of Rossini 's own autographed score . <p> " I worked on it for a week , and when I got done , it was clear that what I had in front of me was a manuscript of almost all the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Several years later while working in Vienna , Gossett was poking around the Rossini holdings in the national library and found a manuscript of " Il viaggio a Vienna . " It was based on the 1848 " Andremo a Parigi ? " but other sections clearly came from the original " Il viaggio . " <p> " By the time we were done , we had just about everything , " Gossett said . " We had enough to begin working . " <p> Another graduate student , Janet Johnson , charged with putting the pieces of " Il viaggio " together , eventually supervised the critical edition . After the 1984 performance and subsequent recording conducted by Abbado , several opera houses , including the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden performed " Il viaggio . " But Gossett and his colleagues did n't want to finalize the critical edition until they saw how the opera worked on stage , and so it was n't printed until 1999 . <p> " We test-drove it in one theater after another , " he said . <p> Gossett fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be updated in performance . <p> " To simply do it straight would be very difficult , " Gossett said . " We have to use a kind of irony to make it work in the theater today . It 's like the Handel stuff . We play Handel , not for laughs , but with irony , and it works brilliantly . "
