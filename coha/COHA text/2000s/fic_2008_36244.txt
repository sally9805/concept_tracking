CYRUS <p> Get the lead out of your ass . " <p> Cyrus jumped , almost falling off his donkey . " Who said that ? " <p> " Get thee to a nunnery . " <p> This time he placed the source . " You 're talking ! " he said to the donkey . <p> " Who said that ? " the animal said . " You 're talking . " <p> " You 're repeating whatever you have heard most recently , " Cyrus said , catching on . " That voice unit was supposed to be for braying . How can you speak words ? " <p> " Defective workmanship , " the donkey said . " You installed the wrong unit . " <p> Cyrus sighed . So using lead instead of iron was n't his only error when he constructed the donkey . When the mechanical animal was too heavy to function effectively , Cyrus 's father Roland had given him blunt advice : remove the lead . So he had done so , and had a robot animal he could ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " About the nunnery . That 's like a monastery , is n't it ? " <p> " Your barbarian mother said it , " the donkey answered . " You were n't paying attention . She was not referring to nuns . " <p> " Not ? " <p> " Not . According to my defective data bank , it 's old Mundanian slang for a house of ill repute . " <p> " What is that ? I never heard of an ill house . " <p> " Naturally you would n't know . You were created halfway innocent , for some obscure reason . But she thought it would make a man of you . " <p> " I 'm not a man , " Cyrus protested . " I 'm a cyborg . Half robot , half human . I will never be fully human . " <p> " That 's what comes of getting yourself delivered to a humanoid robot and a barbarian . If you wanted to be normal you should have selected a normal couple for parents . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraption . They signaled the stork , not me . " <p> " Neither did I have a choice , half-breed . " <p> " Had you had one , you should have chosen a more competent builder , " Cyrus said with a halfway metallic smile . <p> " Indubitably . But since I 'm stuck with you , how about giving me a name ? " <p> " You 're an ass . An equine breed . So suppose I call you  --  " <p> " Forget it , cogbrain ! " <p> Cyrus reconsidered . " Donkey wo n't do ? " <p> " Let 's abbreviate it . Don will do . " <p> " Don Donkey . Not phenomenally original . " <p> " Neither are you , cyborg . " <p> " It will do , " Cyrus agreed with resignation . <p> He rode on , careful not to remark on the animal 's jerky gait , lest he get another sour reminder of his clumsiness in assembling it . The varied terrain of the Land of Xanth passed , becoming less familiar as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the enchanted paths , so there was no danger . <p> Cyrus got thirsty , so fished a can of tsoda pop from a saddlebag . He was about to open it when it slipped out of his hand , fell to the ground , and rolled off the enchanted path . " Bleep , " he said . Because he had been assembled adult , he was able to use that term . It signaled spot disaffection with the situation . <p> There was a golden streak . Something zipped after the can , caught it in its mouth , and brought it back , holding it up . It was a dog made from pure gold . <p> " Thank you , " Cyrus said , accepting the can . The dog zipped away again . " I wonder what kind of creature that was ? " <p> " A golden retriever , dummy , " Don said . " Check your memory bank . " <p> The donkey was right : the information was there . Cyrus simply had n't made the connection . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm low on fuel , " Don complained . <p> Cyrus considered . Chances of getting where they were going today were small , so there was no point in pushing it . " We 'll stop at the next grazing area we see , " he said . <p> " We 'd better . " <p> They came to a small glade strewn with sticks and tufts of old dry grass . " And this is it , " Cyrus said , dismounting . <p> They stepped off the path . Don put his head down and picked up a stick with his mouth . He chewed , and the stick broke in two . He swallowed the pieces . <p> " Oh what a cute little horse ! " a voice exclaimed . It was a rather young pretty girl , in fact almost nymphlike , but clothed . She had flouncing bark brown hair and sky blue eyes . <p> Don lifted his head to view her . " I 'm not a horse , " he said sourly . " I 'm an ass . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A donkey , " Cyrus said quickly , realizing that the Adult Conspiracy prevented her from knowing the other term . " A robot donkey . Call him Don . " <p> " Hello , Don , " she said shyly . " I 'm Piper Nymph . " <p> " I do n't see a pipe , " Don said . <p> " I do n't have a pipe . It 's my name . My parents are Hiatus Human and Desiree Dryad . They named me . " <p> Cyrus 's data bank oriented . He knew of them ; Hiatus was the son of the late Zombie Master , with the talent of growing things like ears on walls . He had fallen in love with a tree nymph , a hamadryad , and finally married her after a seemingly hopeless quest . Cyrus was jealous ; he had no romantic prospects at all . At any rate , that explained Piper 's nymphlike appearance : she was half nymph . <p> " What good are you ? " Don asked . <p> " He 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has barnyard manners . Ignore him . " <p> " No , I 'll answer , " Piper said . " My talent is healing . That can be very useful . In fact I have a pet whirlwind I healed , Dusty . " <p> " A useful whirlwind ? " Don asked , his voice fairly rusting with sarcasm . <p> " Sure . I 'll show you . What do you most need ? " <p> " More dry wood . It 's my fuel . I 'm a wood-burning robot ass . " Don obviously thought he had stifled her positive attitude . <p> Piper put two fingers to her mouth and made an ungirl-like whistle . In a moment a whirling cloud of dust cruised in toward them , tossing leaves and small twigs about . " This is Dusty , " she said as the whirlwind hovered beside her . " Dusty Dust Devil . " <p> " What an ill wind , " Don said . <p> The wind coalesced into a small horned creature . " Why thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don took it in stride . " Can you bring me dry wood , you horny midget ? " " Please , " Piper said . " I 've got a feeling there 's a bad word there . " The devil disappeared , becoming the dust devil . It whirled all around <p> the glade and into the surrounding forest . In a moment it returned , filled with brush , and faded . A pile of dead branches fell to the ground as the devil formed . <p> Don stared . " That will hold me for three days ! " He started chomping <p> wood . " Say thank you , " Cyrus murmured to the donkey . " Why ? " Don asked around a mouthful . Cyrus realized that politeness was not part of the animal 's program . So he gave a reason that would make sense to a selfish creature . " Because you want to encourage him to do it again some time , after you run out of fuel . " Don cocked an ear , understanding . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say you 're welcome , " Piper murmured . " You 're welcome . " Don paused in midchomp . He was coming to appreciate the possible <p> benefits of common courtesy . Piper smiled . She was pretty when she did that . " It 's nice to see folk get along , " she said . <p> Too bad she was only thirteen years old , according to Cyrus 's data bank : too young to be a prospect for romance . Not that Cyrus knew anything about romance . <p> They had to wait while the donkey took in the pile of wood . " What are you doing here ? " Cyrus asked the nymph . <p> " I 'm just widening my horizons , " she said . " Every year mother lets me wander farther from the tree . By the time I 'm adult , I should be familiar with the whole area . Already today I met a man with the talent of selective friction : he can move anywhere , because if he 's on slippery ice , he can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , then change to the other foot . " <p> " So what good is that ? " Don asked . " There 's no ice here . " <p> " Maybe some day there 'll be ice , " Piper said . " Or something else that 's slippery or soupy . " <p> " What do you want to do when you are adult ? " Cyrus asked , partly to stop the donkey from being obnoxious . But also because he did not know what he wanted to do , and perhaps she would give him an idea . <p> " I 'd like to be an actress , I think , " she said . " To be in a play and have people watch me and applaud . I would n't even have to be famous . I 'd just like to be on stage . " <p> That seemed like a curious ambition , but Cyrus 's caution-circuit prevented him from saying so . " I hope you find your play . " <p> " I hope so too . " Piper looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries when I 'm out alone too long . She 's afraid I 'll run afoul of some strange man or something . " <p> Like a cyborg ? That , too , was worth not saying . " Tell her you met a robot donkey with asinine manners . " <p> " I will , " she said . " Come on , Dusty ; I 'll race you to the tree . " <p> The little devil became the whirlwind . Dust devil and girl took off into the forest , racing each other . <p> Meanwhile Don had finished the pile of wood . His belly was full ; it would , as he said , burn for three days , keeping him hot and active . <p> They wended their way back to the enchanted path . " You know , I 'd be able to eat faster and last longer if you 'd designed me to burn coal , " Don said . <p> " Coal has to be mined . Wood 's easier to get . Anyway , I had to use parts of wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That also explains where you got my warped brain chip . " <p> It did indeed . Cyrus was beginning to regret raiding that old battleground . But there had n't seemed to be much alternative if he wanted to ride . <p> As the day waned they came to a camping area . There were pie trees galore , and a nice caterpillar tent . <p> As they approached the tent , a young woman emerged . She looked lean and aggressive . Could she be barbarian ? <p> " Who the bleep are you ? " she demanded . " This tent is mine ; I got here first . Go away . " <p> Cyrus sifted through his data banks . " Enchanted Path Camping Sites are open to all legitimate travelers , " he said . " We are legitimate . " <p> " What , you and that dumb ass ? " <p> " I 'm an ass , but I 'm not dumb , " Don said . " I 'm a smart ass . How smart is your ass , wench ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently taken aback , or at least paused in place . " You talk ! " <p> " Let 's exchange introductions , " Cyrus said hastily . " I am Cyrus Cyborg , and this is Don , a robot donkey . " <p> " He 's got a bleeping potty mouth on him . " <p> " Look who 's talking , you bleeping tart . " <p> Cyrus interposed again . " And you are ? " <p> " Tess , " she said aggressively . " Tess Tosterone . I have a problem . " <p> Don opened his mouth . Cyrus hastily stuffed a scrounged piece of wood into it . " May we inquire what it is ? " <p> " I 'm too pushy . They tell me I need S Trojan to fix it . But I do n't know who or where or what he is , so I 'm irritable . " <p> Cyrus 's data bank sifted again . " Trojan is one name of the Night Stallion who runs the dream realm . The horse of a different color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Then it must be someone else . What would I want with a horse ? Your talking mule is bad enough . Now are you going to clear out of here and let me be ? " <p> Don had chewed and swallowed the stick . " Listen , harridan  --  " <p> Cyrus made another effort to settle things politely , though her attitude was both annoying and intriguing . " We feel we have equal rights to camp here , so we wo n't be moving on tonight . Why do you object to sharing ? " <p> " Because you 're a man , " Tess said bluntly . " All you men want only one thing . " <p> This interested him . " What is that ? " <p> " Do n't pretend you do n't know , you jerk ! " <p> " I 'm not pretending . I do n't know . That 's why I 'm traveling to see the Good Magician . I hope he will tell me what I truly want . " <p> Tess gazed at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I am a serious person , yes . " <p> " And a cyborg . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What 's a cyborg ? " <p> " I am a robot-human crossbreed , part alive , part machine . I am not sure in which category I best belong . " She studied him . " You look completely human . " " Yes , I am crafted to be , externally . But my bones are iron , and I have a memory bank and consciousness chip in my iron skull . I am programmed to have a human outlook . My parents assembled me carefully . " " Actually , you 're one handsome male specimen , with a perfect rough-hewn face , fairly wild hair , and nice muscles . " " My mother is a barbarian . She likes that type . " " She has good taste in men . Your appearance is appealing to women . " " It is ? I did not know . " " And you really do n't know what all men want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data bank , but I need a more specific description to evoke it . If you know , I would appreciate it if you would tell me . It might save me a year 's service with the Good Magician . " Tess laughed , surprising him . " It might indeed . Very well , I will share the tent with you , and maybe by morning you will figure it out for yourself . " " I doubt it . I 'm sure it would be simpler if you just told me . " " Simpler , yes . More fun , no . " Was she teasing him ? Teasing was another human thing Cyrus did not properly understand . There were a number of things like that , that it seemed only experience and new information could clarify . At any rate , Tess seemed to have mellowed , so he did n't question it . Maybe she would tell him in the morning . <p> " I 'll fetch something to eat , " Cyrus said . " Maybe some of those lichens . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't like-ens , they 're dislike-ens . Eat one , and you 'll be unfriendly until you find and eat a like-en to cancel it . I found out the hard way . " <p> He might have guessed . " Thank you . " <p> " The effect wears off eventually . But why complicate things ? " <p> They foraged for pies and had a nice dinner while Don snoozed beside the pond . Tess was companionable , now that she had accepted him as legitimate , but she seemed privately amused about something . Cyrus suppressed his annoyance . <p> As night closed , Tess took charge , in the aggressive way she had . " There are two bunks in the tent . You take the left one , I 'll take the right one . We 'll wash up first . " <p> " As you wish , " he agreed . <p> " Not as you wish ? " <p> " I am amenable to whatever normal procedure is . I admit to having had little experience . It is my first journey away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mommy ? " <p> There was something in her tone , but it seemed a fair question . " Yes . Hannah Barbarian . " <p> " Just how old are you , cyborg ? " <p> " As much as two years . " <p> " Two years ! You look grown ! " <p> " I am grown . I was delivered as a grown-man kit , in a small cat-shaped box , with some assembly required . I understand that effort drove both my parents to distraction , but in the course of the following year they managed to assemble me , and here I am . " <p> She gazed at him assessingly . " So are you grown , or a baby ? Are you familiar with the Adult Conspiracy ? " <p> " Yes , of course . It is in my data bank . It concerns the things that children must be shielded from , such as bad words and stork summoning . Naturally I honor it to the letter ; it 's in my programming . " <p> " Have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , there are pictures in my data bank . " <p> " A real one . " <p> " No . But I 'm sure I know the description . " <p> She shook her head as if bemused . " This way . " She walked to the pond . <p> He followed . " Actually my data indicates that strangers do not readily show their bodies in public , so perhaps I should wait in the tent until you are through . " <p> " Stay . " <p> " But then  --  " He paused , for she had hauled off her shirt . She was somewhat leaner than the picture in his data bank , but it was clear that she was female . " I see . " <p> " I 'll bet . Strip , Cyrus . " <p> " As you wish . " Carefully he removed his shoes , shirt , and trousers . <p> " Well , you look mostly human , " she said . <p> " I am nevertheless a composite , as I said . My bones may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am remarkably strong , but my vessels do bleed when punctured , and I feel pain . " <p> " Look at me . " <p> He had not looked since she removed her skirt , for some reason . Now he did as directed . Her lower half was also lean but definitely female , according to his stored images . That gave him an odd urge , but he was unable to define it . " I am looking . " <p> " And not reacting . You definitely have had no experience . " She waded into the pond . <p> " This is true . " He followed her . Soon they were standing chest deep ( or whatever ) in the water . Her chest was rather more curvaceous than his . He felt slightly guilty for being intrigued . <p> She stood beside him , eyeing him sidelong . Her glance angled off his shoulder and chest before striking the water beyond , raising an amused ripple . " You wo n't short out in the water or anything ? " <p> " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires as such . Thank you for your concern . " <p> " That was irony , pun intended , not concern . " <p> Now he was almost certain she was teasing him , but he did n't know how to react , so he did n't . " Thank you . " <p> Tess shook her head . " You are a wonder ! Come on , I 'll wash your back . " Before he could figure out how to respond , she came up behind him and splashed cool water across his neck and shoulders . Then her hands rubbed against his shoulder blades , and traveled down his back , under the water . " How 's that feel ? " <p> Actually it felt good . The flesh of his back was tight from traveling , and her touch made it relax . " Satisfactory . " <p> " That so ? How about this ? " Her hands moved down and squeezed his bottom . <p> " That feels good in a different way , " he said , surprised . <p> " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it 's your turn . Do me . " She turned around . <p> He turned to face her back . He stroked her shoulders as she had stroked his , then moved down her back , and finally squeezed her bottom . It was considerably plumper than his , despite her general leanness . There was something really evocative about it . " You have a  --  a nice  --  posterior , " he said haltingly . <p> Tess shook her head . " You really , truly , do n't know , " she said . <p> A bulb flashed over his head . " Does this relate to what every man wants ? " <p> " Oh , yes , Cyrus . " <p> " Please , wo n't you tell me ? This is making me feel strange . " <p> She sighed . " I thought you were just another man on the make . I see you are truly innocent . You have the information in your memory , but you do n't know how to apply it to the real world . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in body , not experience . " <p> " That seems to be true . " <p> " And I 've been teasing you , trying to make you reveal your real nature . I should n't have . " <p> " Oh , I am sure you are without fault . " <p> " Thank you . " She considered half a moment more , then made a decision . " Since I teased you , I will untease you . I will show you what you need to know . " <p> " I would really appreciate that . " <p> " What men want is to seduce young women . " <p> " Seduce ? " <p> " Persuade them to assist in signaling the stork . " <p> Cyrus was amazed . " But only married people do that . " <p> Tess stood before him , her hands on his upper arms . " This is one of the differences between what goes into proper data banks and what exists in the real world . People can signal the stork without being married . Elders may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I  --  did n't know . " <p> " Precisely . But I will persuade you . " She squeezed his arms . " Put your arms around me and bring me close to you . We will do it now . " <p> " But we 're standing in the water ! " <p> " Another myth . It can be done anywhere , any way up . Embrace me . Do it . " <p> He put his arms around her and drew her in until she was right up against him . She suddenly seemed twice as shapely as before , especially in front . " This is amazing . " <p> " Indeed . Now let 's say that you have captured me , and want to go farther . A kiss would be persuasive . " <p> " It would ? " <p> " Kiss me , idiot . " <p> Oh . He brought his face down to hers , and hesitated . " On the  --  ? " <p> She jammed her mouth against his , kissing him avidly . He felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a level of experience he had never imagined . <p> She drew back a little . " Now stroke my bottom , as before , but more firmly . " <p> He obeyed . It was as though he were fondling a fine sculpture , evoking a strong yet loving reaction . " Oh , Tess , that makes me want to  --  " Again he ran out of concept . <p> " To summon the stork . Exactly as any man in this situation would . The next step is to  --  " <p> " BRA-A-AAY ! " <p> They both jumped half out of the water , falling away from each other . Don was there by the shore , having awakened from his snooze . <p> " You silly ass ! " Tess exclaimed angrily . <p> " He 's not silly , he 's a smart ass , " Cyrus reminded her . " He told you . " <p> " I just wanted to remind you it 's getting late , " the donkey said . " You need to get out of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman shook herself , evidently annoyed about something . Then she made some kind of internal decision . " He 's right . I think you have the idea now . When you get a woman like that , that 's what you do . You understand what to do with her . " <p> " Yes , I do , " Cyrus agreed . He was almost disappointed that Don had not waited to interrupt them a few minutes later . " Thank you . " <p> " You 're welcome . " She seemed partly frustrated and partly relieved . <p> They emerged from the pool , dried off , and went to their separate beds . Cyrus 's feelings were in turmoil . Tess was right : he did want what she had shown him . Yet he knew it was not customary on so brief an acquaintance . So surely it was best that the donkey had interrupted them . <p> " If you wish , I will join you on your bed , " Tess said from the nearby darkness . " To keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to control himself if she did that . He did not want to antagonize her . It really was n't cool enough to warrant such help . So he demurred . " Thank you , but I am warm enough . " <p> " Okay . " She sounded vaguely disappointed . That was surely his imperfect imagination . Why would a woman want to keep a cyborg warm ? <p> " Do n't let the tics bite you . " <p> " The whats ? " <p> " Bugs that hide in your bed and bite when you 're asleep . Such as robot tics , that make you get all metal and jerky . " <p> " Oh , that would not affect me . I am already part metal , but not , I hope , a jerk . " <p> She laughed for some reason . " Or synthetics , made of plastic and metal . " <p> " Yes , of course . " <p> " Or roman tics , bred in a love spring , that make you amorous . " <p> Cyrus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't want to admit that . " Thank you . I 'll be careful . " <p> That was all . Yet somehow he felt immensely frustrated . What was the matter with him ? He had learned a lot , but realized that though he was indeed interested in summoning the stork , he still was n't satisfied about the course of his life . <p> Well , tomorrow he would reach the Good Magician 's Castle . The Good Magician would surely know . The GM knew everything . <p> Cyrus did not need a lot of sleep , but it was the human thing to do , so he lay still and turned his animation low . <p> In the morning they harvested fresh eggs from the eggplants , bread from the breadfruit tree , and grape and strawberry jellyfish from the pond . Tess showed him how to get fresh cups of hot tea from the T-Tree . It was very good . <p> It was time to resume traveling . " Thank you for your assistance , " Cyrus told Tess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could have been nicer . " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> She sighed . " Of course you do n't . But next time you get bare with a woman , see that the donkey is nowhere near . " <p> " I will try to do that , " he agreed , perplexed . <p> " Let 's get a move on , " Don said impatiently . " We do n't have all day . " <p> " Which way are you going ? " Tess asked . <p> " West , to the Good Magician 's Castle . " <p> " I 'm going east . " <p> " So we may not meet again . " <p> " We may not , " she agreed . <p> The exchange was somehow unsatisfactory , but Cyrus could n't figure out how to correct it . He mounted Don and rode out of the campsite . <p> They almost collided with a slight man coming in . " Oops , my fault , " the man said . " I was n't watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , " Cyrus said . Then , for want of anything else to say , he introduced himself . " I am Cyrus Cyborg , and this is Don Donkey , a robot ass . " <p> " I am Trojan . S Trojan , a meek man .

Women are n't much interested in me . " <p> " This may be the exception . Come , I 'll introduce you to her . " He jumped off the donkey and led the way back . <p> Tess was packing her things into her backpack , about to depart . " What the bleep is this ? " she demanded irritably . Perhaps she had eaten another dislike-en . <p> " This is Trojan , " Cyrus said . " S Trojan . " <p> She looked stricken . It was almost as if she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I really did n't mean to bother you , " Trojan said apologetically . " I am on an unlikely quest to find my ideal Significant Other , assuming such a person exists . " <p> Tess recovered . " Come here , Trojan . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> She strode forward , sweeping him up in a hearty embrace . " You are the one I have been looking for ! " <p> " I do n't understand . I 'm just a nonentity . " <p> " Shut up or I 'll miss you . " <p> " You will what ? " <p> She kissed him . " Never call my bluff . " <p> " I confess that is heady stuff . But what would a fine woman like you want with a nothing like me ?

He had managed to do a good deed . <p> " I do n't understand , " Don said . <p> " Naturally not , " Cyrus agreed smugly . <p> They had not gone far before they heard someone crying . It was a girl , staring wildly around . " Do n't stop , " Don muttered . " We ca n't let silly females slow us down . That pushy Tess was bad enough . " <p> But Cyrus had another idea . " I 'm trying to learn about women . I learned a lot last night , but I 'm sure there 's still more . Also , I have an empathy circuit that makes me want to help folk in need . " <p> " Suit yourself , sucker . Fortunately I lack that silly-ass circuit . Chances are you wo n't be able to help her anyway . " <p> They approached the girl . " May I help you ?

" As she spoke her hair changed from short brown to flowing blond . " I 'm supposed to join a play ensemble as an actress , but I ca n't find it . " <p> " A play group ? " Cyrus 's data bank whirled . " Those are mainly organized by the Curse Fiends . " <p> " No , this is supposed to be right around here , " she insisted . " Only it is n't . I do n't know what to do . " <p> Cyrus had no idea what to do . " Neither do I. Maybe you should ask the Good Magician . " <p> " I just came from him , " she flared , her hair turning fiery red .

May I pet him ? " Don eyed her assessingly . " Do you like asses ? " " Four-footed ones , yes . You 're quite handsome , like your companion . " " Then you may pet me . " Xina did so . " You have such a nice metal mane . " " Yours is pretty nice too . " Don was mellowing considerably , coincidentally . " Could I ride you ? " " Hop on . " Cyrus was unable to help with her problem . There had to be some mistake . Then he thought of something . " Don can stay with you until I return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to ascertain where the ensemble is really supposed to be .
