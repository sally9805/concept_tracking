<p> The annual Midtown Tour of Homes is a celebration of diverse tastes in decor , but the event is also an engaging walk back into Atlanta 's past . <p> Most , if not all , of the 14 residences featured this Saturday and Sunday have a story to tell  --  maybe not as far back as the city 's founding in 1849 , but to some pretty interesting benchmarks during the 20th century . <p> Take the home of interior designer Randall Cobb and dentist Lisa DeAngelis at 421 Seventh St. Built in the early 1960s , it was designed by architect Henri Jova as a retirement home for his parents , just part of a three-structure residential compound at Seventh and Mentelle streets where Jova himself lived . <p> Jova was a pioneer in Midtown 's renaissance , Cobb said . One of the founders of the Midtown Neighbors Association , organizer of the tour of homes , Jova first specialized in home renovation , essential to Midtown 's gentrification . A few years later , however , Jova made an indelible mark on Midtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 14th and Peachtree . <p> The Cobb-DeAngelis home retains Jova touches  --  a mantel from France , expansive windows , dark red ceilings . Although the roof , kitchen , bathrooms , electrical and HVAC systems were recently renovated , Cobb said it was not necessary to correct any mistakes by previous owners . <p> " The neglect was benign , " he said . <p> Two prize acquisitions adorn the patio . One is a custom Vietri tabletop big enough to seat 10 , which DeAngelis brought back from Italy . The other is a crushed rectangular block , the remains of a sports car that once belonged to Jova . ( " I tell people I got a Porsche thrown in with the house , " Cobb said . ) <p> A few blocks to the west , John and Alison Douglas ' loft residence was for years just another office in what was once the Social Security Administration Building , now called the 805 Peachtree Building . <p> This was a turn-of-the-21st-century conversion , one of the first of its kind in Midtown , that transformed abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglases ' long foyer is dramatic , expanding in width from the front door to the living and dining rooms . The effect is heightened by a concrete pillar at the far end of the foyer , which the Douglases masked with a billowy white circular curtain , and by three conga drums , graduated in size , which sit in the center of the entryway . The drums are more than just ornamentation ; Douglas plays them and is lead singer in an alternative pop band called Ten Story Relapse , which is currently recording its third CD . <p> The Douglases bought their unit in 2006 and did their own painting , choosing to go from whites to subdued grays and browns the deeper one goes inside their loft . Their artwork and furnishings provide color accents . <p> Much of their furniture was custom-designed and built with an emphasis on communal seating in their living room , dining room and media area . " Our only chairs are at our desks in our office , " Mrs. Douglas said , " and  --  oh , yes  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Asked what life was like three stories above " Atlanta 's Main Street , " Douglas said it was a bit noisy when they first moved in , " but then things calmed down , the police put an end to cruising down Peachtree , and it 's been fine . Otherwise , it 's great to be close in , for instance only a block or so from the Fox Theatre .
