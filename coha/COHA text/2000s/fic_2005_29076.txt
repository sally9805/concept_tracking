1 What can be funny about having to stand up in front of everyone you know , in a ruffly dress the color of Pepto-Bismol , and proclaim your womanhood ? Nothing . Nada . Zip . Not when you 're fifteentoo young to drive , win the lottery , or vote for a president who might lower the driving and gambling ages . Nothing funny at all . At least that 's what I thought in September . Mywomanhoodshad n't even begun to grow ; I wore a bra size so small they 'd named it with lowercase letters : aaa . Guys avoided me like the feminine hygiene aisle at the grocery store . And I never wore dresses . Not since I 'd left school uniforms behind . Not ever , no exceptions . You 'd think my own grandmother would remember that . She did n't . " Eh , Violet , m'ija . I want buy you a gown and make you a ' keen-say ' party , " my grandmother said early that September morning in her customized English , shrewdly springing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abuela , " I said as I buttered my muffin .

Thrift store worker 's hours . Mom ran the Rise &; Walk Thrift Sanctuary , a used-clothing shop in the church basement that operates on donations . Their motto is " The Threads Shall Walk Again .

All they needed now was a tattoo parlor . " What 's ' keent-sy ' ? " Mark asked , adding , " I want one too !

Only for girls . " He tried another pass at his cereal bowl , but it was empty . " I know , because last year in my school on Take Your Daughters to Work Day , Father Leone said sons got to go to work too . So I got out of school ! " Abuela , looking starched somehow in one of Mom 's old terry cloth robes , her silver hair in a bun , raised an eyebrow and gave a wry smile . " This is equality , yes ? " She often says yes when she means no , and vice versa . " The quinceanero , m'ijo , this is the time when the girl becomes the woman . " Mark , who was eleven then , shied away from any discussion that even hinted at having to do with body parts or workings . He turned corpuscle red , a nice counterpoint to his royal blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day during the pro season , except in school and church , until the end of the last game of the World Series . The fringe of his dark hair stuck out in a ragged halo around his face . He immediately lost interest in the quince party . " Nevermind , countmeout , " he mumbled . Abuela did n't notice . " The quince is the time when all the resto del mundo ass-cepts your dear sister as an adult in the eyes of God and family . And she , in turn , promises to ass-cept responsabilidad for all the wonders in the world of adults . " Responsabilidad . This sank in as deeply as the Country Crock into the nooks and crannies of my half-eaten English muffin , and raised a red flag . This quince party could be some sort of trap . " What if I do n't want toass-cept more responsibilities ? " I asked , mindlessly mimicking Abuela 's pronunciation . Mark slipped away , leaving his empty cereal bowl and milk glass on the table . Abuela sat down with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say ? These come with the territory , chiquitica . " She downed her coffee in one shot . I pointed to Mark 's dirty bowl . " How about his responsibilities ? " She shrugged and motioned for me to clear his place . " Now that 's sexist , " I grumbled , stomping off to the sink with Mark 's dishes and my own . Abuela said something that rhymed in Spanish , then translated : " The bull can not make the milk , and the cow alone can not make the bull . " I kissed her , shaking my head , and left for school . There 's no sense arguing with the fundamentals . Leda Lundquist stood waiting for me outside Spanish class . My friend Leda is as slim as a sunflower and admirably as tall , though not quite as seedy . She has long , straight , pale-pale blond hair and white-white skin with just the faintest glow to indicate that blood does run through her veins . " Yo , Paz , " she said to me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come away with me this weekend . " " Do n't you have a boyfriend for that , Leed ? " I asked , sweeping past her and into the last row of seats . Leda set down her gym duffel and books and sat beside me , braiding her hair into an orderly rope . She wore a giant turquoise tie-dyed T-shirt as a dress , belted with a rolled-up bandana . Rubber flip-flops and a pink plastic Slinky on one arm for a bracelet completed her back-to-school look . " I have got the perfect fund-raiser for youfor usto go to Saturday afternoon . " I groaned . " No way , " I said , before she had a chance to state her case . " C-U-B-A " was all she said , and she waited for my reaction . I raised my eyebrows in a let-me-have-it look . " The Cuba Caravan 's coming through town . Is n't your dad going ?

" Forget it , Leda , " I said , wondering how many times I 'd been caught up in this constant refusal of invitations since we 'd first met .

" She paused . " Besides what ? " " Well . . . if we stand around long enough , you might meet some hunky Cuban guys at the salsa dance . . . and I could top a thousand bucks in the walkabout fund .

It had been Leda 's idea to take the first year of each language offered at Tri-District High so she 'd be able to speak a little of the native tongue no matter where she roamed . Last year , merci beaucoup , it had been French . I did n't care which language I learned , so I tagged along for the fun of it . Se-ora Wong , diminutive but not fragile , ruled with an ironic fist . " Leona , Violeta , could you find it in your hearts to join the rest of us ? " she asked , calling us by our Spanish-class names , hitting just the right note of sarcasm . She went on to show the class the same list of easy nouns that Leda and I learned last year at this time : casa , sombrero , estudianteonly last year it was in French .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
