There is an axiom in American politics that says whenever a sitting President is running for a second term , the election is more a referendum on him than a judgment on his opponent . President George W. Bush has taken this truism to a new level . With just under a year to go before Nov. 2 , 2004 , Americans are already finding ways to show how passionately they feel about their President . In August , KB Toys rolled out its George W. Bush Elite Force Aviator doll , a 12-in. action figure in full naval flight gear . At $39.99 , it has set the sales record for collectible action figures on KB 's website . There 's also brisk traffic on the Web for donations in memory of Sally Baron , 71 , of northern Wisconsin , and Gertrude M. Jones , 81 , of Mandeville , La . Obituaries for both women contained requests that money be sent to any organization working for the removal of Bush from office . And in Jefferson County , Colo. , West Jefferson Middle School teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT MY PRESIDENT button on her coat during a sixth-grade field trip . Republicans in Colorado 's state legislature honored the family that lodged the complaint ; the teacher now wears a lapel pin to class that features an American flag and a peace sign . <P> But there is little evidence of peace out there in an increasingly restive electorate . If Ronald Reagan was the Great Communicator , Bush is proving to be the Great Polarizer . Reagan and then Bill Clinton ushered in the modern age of the acrimoniously divided electorate , but George Bush has cleaved the nation into two tenaciously opposed camps even more than his predecessors . He is the man about whom Americans feel little ambivalence . People tend to love him or hate him without any complicating shades of gray . Shout " George Bush " in a crowded theater , and people dive into two trenches . A new TIME/CNN poll shows that Americans are almost equally divided in their support for President Bush , with 47% suggesting that they are likely to vote for him and 48% saying they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the poll shows his job-approval rating stands at 52% , down from its peak of 89% in October 2001 , and his disapproval has reached a new high for his presidency of 43% . <P> But those numbers do not reveal the intensity on both sides  --  the zeal of those who regard Bush as the very ideal of American presidential leadership and those who regard him as an embarrassing and dangerous usurper . Nor does it take full account of a more paradoxical group : those who like his personality but loathe his policies and want him out of the White House . Fully 81% of Republicans say they like the job that Bush is doing ; only 31% of Democrats do . " The President is a strong leader . He 's very determined . He does n't seem to be swayed too quickly by polls , " says Jerome Kohel , 59 , an accountant from Richland , Mich . But another fellow of the same age in that same crucial electoral state , car hauler Jim Carothers , fumes , " I think he 's doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know he was lying about the pretext for war . "
