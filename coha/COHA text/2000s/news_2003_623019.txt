<p> To hear Intel tell it , last week 's launch of a new series of chips for notebook PCs  --  collectively marketed as Centrino Mobile Technology  --  heralds the dawn of a new era for on-the-go computing . <p> That may turn out to be true , if Intel delivers on ambitious plans for follow-up versions of the new technology later this year and beyond . For now , though , while Centrino does deliver some real benefits  --  above all , better battery life  --  it 's hardly a revolution . <p> At least that 's my conclusion after trying out notebooks built around the new chips by Gateway , IBM and Toshiba . And a fourth new notebook  --  a super-small , dockable Sharp model that does n't use any of the new Intel technology  --  suggests that there will still be compelling innovation without Centrino . <p> As to wireless networking  --  a prime focus of the $300-million ad campaign Intel has initiated to promote Centrino  --  the new products will undoubtedly accelerate what 's already a strong trend : Wireless will soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are today . <p> Technologically , however , Intel is breaking no new ground in this area . On the contrary , in some ways it lags behind competitors , and for some buyers that may be a good reason to avoid Centrino notebooks . <p> WHAT 'S A CENTRINO ? <p> The heart of the Centrino platform , as Intel calls it , is a new processor dubbed the Pentium M , but the term also covers two additional components : new chipsets , the housekeeping and traffic-control chips that link the central processor to the rest of the computer , and an internal wireless-networking card . <p> Intel officials like to say the Pentium M ( previously known by the code name Banias , after a national park in Israel , where it was developed ) was designed from the ground up for notebooks . That 's not quite true  --  its core was derived mainly from the Pentium III , and some of its features come from the Pentium 4 . <p> But the Pentium M is more distinct from its desktop cousins than previous Intel mobile processors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively modest clock speeds , at least by recent Intel standards : It starts at just 900 MHz , in an ultra-low-voltage version designed for the lightest notebooks , and even the fastest version reaches only 1.6 GHz , barely more than half the frequency of the fastest Pentium 4 desktop processors . <p> That 's because Intel 's engineers found ways to boost performance without the increased power drain and heat that higher clock rates entail . For example , they expanded the chip 's Level 2 memory cache to 1 MB , improved its ability to anticipate tasks and boosted the speed at which data moves to and from the chip . <p> As a result , a 1.6-GHz Pentium M delivers about the same speed in real-life operations as a 2- or 2.2-GHz mobile Pentium 4  --  another reminder that megahertz and gigahertz are n't necessarily good indicators of actual processing speed ( a point Intel rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Sun have been making for years ) . <p> Second , while Intel for years has included power-management circuitry in its notebook chips  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be grafted onto what were originally desktop designs . With the Pentium M and its chipsets , they 're designed right in  --  and considerably more aggressive than before . <p> To measure their effectiveness , I tested the battery life of new Pentium M notebooks in two ways . First , I ran MobileMark 2002 , a benchmark program developed by Bapco , a nonprofit consortium that includes Intel and AMD , other industry heavyweights and leading trade publications . It measures performance and battery life by running common applications such as Word , Excel , Outlook and Photoshop . <p> Second , I devised my own simple test : playing streaming audio received wirelessly from the Internet with the screen left on . I tried both tests with a variety of power-management settings in Windows XP 's Power Options control panel . <p> LONGEST TEST 6 HOURS <p> I managed only once to get the five hours of battery life Intel boasts that some Centrino systems deliver  --  in one test the Toshiba Tecra S1 ran for more than 6 hours !  --  but I consistently got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With normal real-life interruptions and the screen set to dim during idle time , you should easily get four or more hours of work time from midsize Centrino systems . <p> Those are n't totally unprecedented numbers  --  a few older PC notebooks match them , and some of Apple 's Macintosh portables do even better  --  but they 're a lot better than most Windows portables currently offer . <p> The wireless component of Centrino chips is more problematic  --  and confusing . <p> Intel 's wireless circuitry is not built into the Pentium M or the companion chipsets  --  it 's on a separate card that plugs into an expansion slot on the notebook 's logic board . Technically , it 's just an option  --  you could run a Pentium M notebook just fine with no card in that slot , or , because the slot is based on a common standard called Mini-PCI , the manufacturer could install a card from another wireless-networking supplier . <p> Under the terms Intel has set for PC-makers , however , only machines that have all three Centrino components  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated chipset  --  can carry the Centrino brand and sport the brightly colored , butterfly-shaped logo that identifies it . <p> The Gateway 450 notebook I tested included the Intel card , and it worked fine ( contrary to rumors gleefully spread by Intel competitors ) . In fact , I got better reception with that unit than with any other wireless notebook I 've ever tested : I carried it 2 1/2 houses down my block before the connection dropped . <p> But there are good reasons some customers might not want the all-Intel solution . For now the only wireless card the company offers is based on the IEEE 802.11b standard , which delivers a maximum speed of 11 Mbps . But several competitors make cards that support both 802.11b and 802.11a , a related standard that offers speeds up to 54 Mbps . ( Intel originally planned to include just such a dual-band card as part of the Centrino package , but it did n't get the necessary chips finished in time for this week 's introduction . Until they 're ready , Intel 's Centrino wireless cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Meanwhile , 802.11g , another flavor of wireless that delivers up to 54 Mbps but ( unlike 11a ) can also work in 11b networks , has burst on the scene . Even though its technical specification has n't yet been approved , several manufacturers have come out with products based on the final draft , and by all accounts they 're selling like hotcakes . <p> While nearly all of the wireless networking infrastructure  --  in homes , schools , businesses and public " hot spots "  --  is based on 11b , many customers are likely to think twice about spending $1,500 to $2,500 on a new notebook that 's limited , in effect , to last year 's standard . ( That 's especially true because upgrading internal Mini-PCI wireless cards is n't easy , in part because of Federal Communications Commission regulations . At a minimum , an upgrade will involve returning the notebook to the factory or to an authorized service center . ) <p> And some customers , particularly in the corporate arena , may be happy to stick with 11b for now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Cisco Systems , for example  --  as their company standard . <p> All of this puts notebook manufacturers in a bind : Do they stick to the Intel solution , and benefit from the buzz the chipmaker is trying so hard to build around the Centrino brand , or do they offer alternatives even at the cost of losing that logo ? It 's a particular problem for companies that let customers configure their purchases over the Web : One click on a pop-up menu listing wireless technologies ( or none at all ) and a notebook pitched as a Centrino system instantly ceases to be one . <p> I 'm happy to report that most manufacturers seem to be dealing with this dilemma by leaving the choice up to their customers . IBM and Toshiba , for example , rolled out some full-fledged Centrino models last week , but the IBM ThinkPad T40 I tried came with a Cisco 11b card , while the Toshiba Tecra S1 had a dual-mode ( 11a and 11b ) card made by Atheros . <p> Both of these cards also worked fine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use more power than the Centrino , I got better battery life with the non-Centrino Toshiba and IBM models than I did with Gateway 's Centrino system . <p> BOTTOM LINE <p> These days the notebook marketplace is crowded with processor options , and the introduction of Centrino and the Pentium M wo n't change that in the foreseeable future . The biggest , fastest " desktop replacement " models will continue to use desktop Pentium 4 chips ; many mainstream notebooks will still come with mobile Pentium 4s or AMD Athlons ; mobile Celerons or Athlons will keep filling low-priced models ; and the smallest , lightest machines  --  like Sharp 's tiny but elegant new Actius MM10  --  will still rely on Transmeta 's Crusoe . <p> What the new Intel technology adds is an option that combines very good performance with fairly long battery life . If that 's what you 're after , the Pentium M is a fine choice . And if you want wireless , the Centrino package will do the job , but do n't be afraid to choose an alternative  --  the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPRING CROP OF NEW NOTEBOOKS <p> Gateway 450 <p>  --  Configuration : 1.5-GHz Pentium M , 256 MB RAM , 30-GB hard drive , DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drive , 14-inch display , USB 2.0 , FireWire , V.92 modem , 10/100 Ethernet and integrated Intel 802.11b wireless . <p> Weight : 6.1 pounds . <p> OS : Windows XP Professional <p> Price : $1,599 <p> Assessment : Gateway 's only Pentium M offering for now , a true Centrino system , is packed with features , and current promotional pricing on certain configurations makes it a real bargain : A unit like the one I tested , except with a 15-inch display , is just $1,599 , and an extra battery that fits in the CD/DVD bay is just $1 more . A little big and heavy for frequent travel , but a good choice for home and business use . Note , however , that the warranty on consumer configurations is only one year . <p> Test configuration not available . Price is for similar unit with 15-inch screen .. <p> IBM Thinkpad T40 <p> Configuration : 1.5-GHz Pentium M , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 14-inch display , USB 2.0 , 56K modem , wired Gigabit Ethernet and integrated Cisco 802.11b wireless <p> Weight : 4.9 pounds <p> OS : Windows XP Professional <p> Price as configured : $2,429 <p> Assessment : Slimmer and noticeably lighter than the Gateway 450 , the latest addition to IBM 's " thin and light " T Series , always popular with corporate travelers , offers the same elegant black styling , superb keyboard , 3-year warranty and relatively high pricing as its predecessors . A Centrino version  --  i.e. , the same machine but with Intel 's wireless card  --  costs $30 less , but the configuration 's Cisco card will appeal to companies that have standardized on Cisco 802.11b gear and its extra security protections . <p> IBM also introduced Centrino models in its lightweight X Series and its bigger but cheaper R Series .. <p> Toshiba TECRA S1 <p> Configuration : 1.5-GHz Pentium M , 256 MB RAM , 40-GB hard drive , 15-inch display , USB 2.0 , V.92 modem , wired 10/100 Ethernet and integrated Atheros 802.11a/802.11b wireless <p> Weight : 6.3 pounds <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,197 <p> Assessment : The Tecra S1 is comparable in size and features to the Gateway 450 , but the higher price buys you a 15-inch screen , a three-year warranty and a nine-cell battery ( versus six cells in the Gateway ) . With its extra-big battery , the S1 actually ran for an amazing 6 hours , 26 minutes on one of my tests , although Toshiba claims only " up to 5.1 hours . " Note that the Atheros wireless card in the configuration tested adds $150 to the price . <p> Toshiba also offers Centrino technology in its Satellite Pro line and in the Portege R100 , a new ultrathin , 2.3-lb. model that replaces the Portege 2000 . <p> 1.5-GHz Pentium M not currently available in this model . Price is for a similar configuration with 1.4-GHz Pentium M .. <p> Sharp ACTIUS MM10 <p> Configuration : 933-MHz Transmeta Crusoe 5800 , 256 MB RAM , 15-GB hard drive , external DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo free with registration , 10.4-inch display , USB 2.0 , PC Card modem , wired 10/100 Ethernet and integrated 802.11b wireless . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Price : $1,499 <p> Assessment : Powered not by Centrino technology or even a Pentium M but by a Transmeta processor , the Actius MM10 is definitely not for everyone , but its ultralight weight , small size ( only a half-inch thick ) and clever docking system may appeal to users who just want an easy-to-carry adjunct to their main PC . When it 's plugged into the USB 2.0 docking cradle/battery charger that comes with it , it shows up as an extra hard drive on the Windows desktop , and the Iomega-developed software that 's included can automatically synchronize files and folders you specify between the two drives . Screen and keyboard are small , processing speed is only a fraction of the Pentium M 's , and battery life is limited ( about 2 1/2 hours in my tests , although Sharp offers a secondary battery that adds only 1 pound to the system 's weight but increases total run time to 9 hours , according to the company ) . <p> If nothing else , the MM10 shows you do n't need a Centrino or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new approach to mobile computing . <p> Source : Chronicle research
