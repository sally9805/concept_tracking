Settling Accounts The Grapple By Harry Turtledove Random House Harry Turtledove I Funereal music poured out of the wireless set on Brigadier General Clarence Potter 's desk . For three days , Confederate stations had played nothing but somber tunes and even more somber commentaries praising the courage of the army whose survivors had just surrendered in Pittsburgh . Potter 's mouth twisted . Behind steel-rimmed spectacles , his cold gray eyes flashed . That army should have taken Pittsburgh away from the damnyankees . With their great industrial center gone , the USA should have had to make peace . From everything the Intelligence officer knew , Pittsburgh was a wreck . That would hurt the United States . But the army that should have conquered it was gone , every man a casualty or a prisoner . That would hurt the Confederate States even more . The latest dirge-tempo march ended . An announcer came on the air . " Courage , self-denial , modesty , and the willingness to make every sacrifice are the highest virtues of the Confederate soldier , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederacy to take up arms . This war was forced upon us by the destructive aims of our enemies . " Well , what else could the man say ? If he came right out and announced that Jake Featherston wanted to go to war long before he became President of the CSA , it would n't look good . Potter knew perfectlywell that it was true . He also knew that what was true and what made good propaganda often had not even a nodding acquaintance with each other . " Our soldiers are completely imbued with the importance and the value of the ideas now championed by the Freedom Party , " the announcer said . For better and for worse , Potter knew how true that was . The announcer went on , " The Confederate soldier is convinced of them to the very depths of his innermost being , and that is why the Confederate armed forces form an invincible bloc having as its spiritual foundation the sublime ethics of a soldierly tradition . It is , moreover , inspired by belief in its high mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , the enemy who would gladly deny our great nation its very right to exist . " Again , he was n't wrong . This was the fourth war between the USA and the CSA in the past eighty years . But if the Confederates were so bloody invincible , what went wrong in Pennsylvania ? Potter , a confirmed cynic , would think of something like that . Would the average Confederate who was listening ? Maybe not . " We see the most magnificent example of this in the sacrifice of the troops fighting at Pittsburgh , " the announcer went on . " That let our armies farther west build up new dams to hold back the raging Yankee torrent and continue to preserve the Confederacy from the annihilating rule of the USA . Cut off from all possibility of receiving reinforcements , surrounded by implacable foes , they fought on with bayonets and entrenching tools after their ammunition was exhausted . Truly their courage and devotion will live forever . " The music swelled once more : yet another sorrowful tune . Potter sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered why he kept listening . Knowing what the rest of the country was going through was useful . That had something to do with it . The rest was akin to picking at a scab . The pain held a perverse attraction . He started a little when the telephone rang . Turning down the music , he picked up the handset . " Potter here . " If anybody needed to know what he did , that person had got hold of him by mistake . " Hello , Potter there . " The voice on the other end of the line was a harsh rasp every Confederate citizen recognized at once . " I need you to be Potter here , soon as you can get on over . " " Yes , Mr. President . On my way . " Potter hung up . He turned off the wireless . When Jake Featherston said he wanted to see you as soon as you could come , you needed to get to the Gray House in a hurry . Potter went upstairs . The door by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted on the frosted-glass window . You would never open it unless you already knew where it led . Workmen labored to repair bomb damage . The damnyankees hit the War Department as often as they could . More and more of the business here went on underground -- how far underground , even Potter was n't sure any more . The men who bossed the work parties were whites too old or too crippled to help the war effort . Some of the men in the crews were colored , though a lot of Negroes had already been removed from Richmond . More workmen were Mexicans , up from Francisco Jose 's ramshackle empire to find better-paying work in the CSA . Some offices on the ground floor were still usable . The officers and clerks who worked in them took a sour pride in staying at those battered desks as long as they could . Several men waved to Potter as he walked past . He nodded in return . All the motorcars outside the War Department were ordinary civilian models . Every so often , U.S. fighters streaked low over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No point giving them any special targets . As if at a cab stand , Potter got into the forwardmost auto . " The Gray House , " he told the driver . " Yes , sir . " The soldier started the engine and put the Birmingham in gear . More work crews repaired streets and gas lines and water mains and electric lines and telephone wires and . . . anything else that could be damaged when bombs fell on it or near it . Hardly any glass windows faced the world these days . Plywood and cardboard covered even the ones the damnyankees had n't blown to smithereens . Again , Mexicans did a lot of the work Negroes would have handled before . The Confederate States would be a different country when the war was through . Whites had anxiously watched blacks for much too long . Well , soon there 'd be far fewer blacks to need watching . Potter had long opposed the Freedom Party , but he did n't mind its taking a shot at the Negro problem . He did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the driver had to detour several times before he got to the presidential mansion . Craters made some streets impassable . One block had sawhorses and warning signs all around . danger ! unexploded bomb ! the signs shouted in big red letters . Maybe the bomb was a dud . Maybe a time fuse ticked inside it . Either way , Potter did n't envy the men who worked to get the ordnance out of there . They were skilled technicians . No matter how skilled they were , their average life expectancy was measured in weeks . The snouts of sandbagged antiaircraft guns poked up from the Gray House grounds . Not much of the building was left above ground . The damnyankees kept doing their best to level it . They wanted Jake Featherston dead , not only because losing him would take the wind out of the Confederacy 's sails , but also because Confederate bombs had killed U.S. President Al Smith . " Here you are , sir . " The driver pulled to a stop in front of the rubble pile . " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a clash of gears , it rolled away . Guards waited in among the wreckage . " Let 's see your papers , sir , " one of them said . No one got anywhere in the CSA without proper papers these days . Potter displayed his . Once the guards were satisfied about who he was , one of them used a telephone . That done , he nodded to his pal . Together , they opened a heavy steel trap door . Potter went down the stairs . They bent several times to foil blast that might penetrate the door above . In due course , he got to another door , this one even thicker . He pressed the button next to it . It swung open from the inside . More guards nodded to him . " Come with us , sir , " one of them said . " I know the drill , " Potter said . They ignored him . He 'd figured they would . All of what went on at the Gray House went on underground these days . People who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pasty as . . . people who spent a lot of time underground at the War Department . Potter looked at the backs of his own hands , and at the veins clearly visible there . He was n't a vampire , to whom the sun was death , but he often behaved as if he were . Lulu , Jake Featherston 's longtime secretary , nodded to him . " He 'll be with you in a moment , General , " he said . " Thank you , ma'am , " Potter answered . You treated Lulu with respect or you were sorry . No one ever talked about the authority secretaries and other such people had , which did n't make it any less real . The moment stretched to about five minutes . Featherston was n't in the habit of making people cool their heels just to be sitting . Something had to be going on . And something was . Nathan Bedford Forrest III , the head of the Confederate General Staff , came out of the President 's office . He did n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter in the waiting room . Potter was n't happy to see him , either . They were n't quite conspirators . If it looked as if Jake Featherston was dragging the CSA down to ruin , someone would have to try to dispose of him . If that worked , someone would have to try to run the country afterwards . As far as Potter could see , Nathan Bedford Forrest III made far and away the best candidate . Forrest wanted the job as much as he wanted another head . That did n't mean he would n't try to do it -- he had a strong sense of duty . It meant he hoped everything would turn out all right , even though he was the one who 'd first wondered whether Jake Featherston was going round the bend . Did Featherston know about those wary discussions ? If he did , would Nathan Bedford Forrest III still be free ? Potter did n't think so . " You can go in now , General , " Lulu said . " Thank you very much , " Potter said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kindly . He 'd never lost the more than half-Yankee way of speaking he picked up to fit in while he was at Yale . " Hello , Potter , " Jake Featherston said . The President of the CSA was in his early fifties , tall and rawboned , his close-cropped brown hair going gray . His eyes had dark pouches under them that had n't been there a few years before . They still blazed , though . If ruthless determination could pull the CSA through , Featherston was the man to give it . " What 's up , sir ? " Potter asked , hoping it had nothing to do with Nathan Bedford Forrest III . " I need you to light a fire under Professor FitzBelmont . I do n't care if you promise him prime pussy or promise you 'll shoot his kids if he does n't get his ass in gear , but get him moving . We really need that uranium bomb , " Featherston said . The Confederate uranium program had got off to a slow start because the President did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame him for that ; who in his right mind would have believed it ? But when the Confederates learned the United States were going after uranium explosives as hard as they could , they 'd had to follow suit . " If lighting a fire will do anything , I 'll do it . " Potter was n't sure it would . Separating U-235 from U-238 was proving fiendishly hard and fiendishly expensive . " They could use more money and more men , too . " " Whatever they need , we 'll give it to them , " Featherston vowed . " If the damnyankees are ahead of us on this one , we 're screwed . If we beat ' em to the punch , we win . Even Pittsburgh wo n't matter at all . It 's about that simple . Or will you tell me I 'm wrong ? " He glared a challenge at Potter . " No , sir . " Potter meant it . He might despise Jake Featherston the man , but Jake Featherston the leader was dead right here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great War because he thought it would prove a cleaner , more chivalrous way of fighting than the mess on the ground . And he was right -- for a while . After a career as a lawyer in occupied Canada , he came back to flying not long before the new -- the greater ?  - -  war broke out . With his wife and daughter killed by a Canuck bomber , he threw himself into aviation as much to stay sane as for any other reason . And he got shot down over Virginia and spent a while languishing in the Confederates ' Andersonville POW camp . If not for a tornado that flung barbed wire in all directions , he would have been there yet . Now he was a foot soldier , not because he wanted to be one but because he had no choice . The Negro guerrillas who found him would have killed him if he did n't join their band . Chickens and chunks of pork roasted over campfires in the pine woods of southwestern Georgia . The white man from whose farm they 'd been taken did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did his family . The USA and the CSA followed the Geneva Convention when they fought each other . The USA and the Mormon rebels in Utah played by the rules , too ; the Mormons were , if anything , more scrupulous than their U.S. foes about keeping them . Between black guerrillas and Confederates , rules went out the window . It was war to the knife . " Smells goddamn good , " Captain Nick Cantarella said . The infantry officer , much younger than Moss , had escaped from Andersonville with him . With his knowledge of how to fight on the ground , Cantarella had to be more valuable to the Negroes than Moss was . " Be ready soon . " The black who led the guerrillas called himself Spartacus . He was n't far from Moss ' age . He 'd fought for the CSA in the Great War , and reminded Moss of a career noncom in the U.S. Army . Jake Featherston did n't want any Negroes fighting on his side . Spartacus used everything he 'd learned fighting for the Confederacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some hot , greasy pork and a tin cup of chicory-laced coffee , he asked , " What do you aim to do next ? " He had no trouble treating Spartacus as his CO , and it was n't just because the black man could kill him with a word . Like most whites in the USA , Moss had n't had much to do with Negroes . There were n't many in the United States , and most whites were happy to keep it that way . Continues ...
