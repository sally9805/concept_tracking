Chapter One Policeman 's Day A white Pomeranian named Fluffy flew out of a fifth-floor window in Panna , which was a brand-new building with the painter 's scaffolding still around it . Fluffy screamed in her little lap-dog voice all the way down , like a little white kettle losing steam , bounced off the bonnet of a Cielo , and skidded to a halt near the rank of schoolgirls waiting for the St Mary 's Convent bus . There was remarkably little blood , but the sight of Fluffy 's brains did send the conventeers into hysterics , and meanwhile , above , the man who had swung Fluffy around his head by one leg , who had slung Fluffy into the void , one Mr Mahesh Pandey of Mirage Textiles , that man was leaning on his windowsill and laughing . Mrs Kamala Pandey , who in talking to Fluffy always spoke of herself as ' Mummy ' , now staggered and ran to her kitchen and plucked from the magnetic holder a knife nine inches long and two wide . When Sartaj and Katekar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing in front of the bedroom door , looking intensely at a dense circle of two-inch-long wounds in the wood , about chest-high . As Sartaj watched , she sighed , raised her hand and stabbed the door again . She had to struggle with both hands on the handle to get the knife out . ' Mrs Pandey , ' Sartaj said . She turned to them , the knife still in a double-handed grip , held high . She had a pale , tear-stained face and tinybare feet under her white nightie . ' Mrs Pandey , I am Inspector Sartaj Singh , ' Sartaj said . ' I 'd like you to put down that knife , please . ' He took a step , hands held up and palms forward . ' Please , ' he said . But Mrs Pandey 's eyes were wide and blank , and except for the quivering of her forearms she was quite still . The hallway they were in was narrow , and Sartaj could feel Katekar behind him , wanting to pass . Sartaj stopped moving . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife . ' Police ? ' a voice said from behind the bedroom door . ' Police ? ' Mrs Pandey started , as if remembering something , and then she said , ' Bastard , bastard , ' and slashed at the door again . She was tired now , and the point bounced off the wood and raked across it , and Sartaj bent her wrist back and took the knife quite easily from her . But she smashed at the door with her hands , breaking her bangles , and her last wiry burst of anger was hard to hold and contain . Finally they sat her down on the green sofa in the drawing room . ' Shoot him , ' she said . ' Shoot him . ' Then she put her head in her hands . There were green and blue bruises on her shoulder . Katekar was back at the bedroom door , murmuring . ' What did you fight about ? ' Sartaj said . ' He wants me not to fly any more . ' ' What ? ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' She had startling light-brown eyes , and she was angry at Sartaj for asking . ' He thinks since I 'm an air hostess , I keep hostessing the pilots on stopovers , ' she said , and turned her face to the window . Katekar was walking the husband over now , with a hand on his neck . Mr Pandey hitched up his silky red-and-black striped pyjamas , and smiled confidentially at Sartaj . ' Thank you , ' he said . ' Thanks for coming . ' ' So you like to hit your wife , Mr Pandey ? ' Sartaj barked , leaning forward . Katekar sat the man down , hard , while he still had his mouth open . It was nicely done . Katekar was a senior constable , an old subordinate , a colleague really - they had worked together for almost seven years now , off and on . ' You like to hit her , and then you throw a poor puppy out of a window ? And then you call us to save you ? ' ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see . ' ' Then look at this , ' Mr Pandey said , his jaw twisting . ' Look , look , look at this . ' And he pulled up his left pyjama jacket sleeve , revealing a shiny silver watch and four evenly spaced scratches , livid and deep , running from the inside of the wrist around to the elbow . ' More , I 've got more , ' Mr Pandey said , and bowed low at the waist and lowered his head and twisted to raise his collar away from the skin . Sartaj got up and walked around the coffee table . There was a corrugated red welt on Mr Pandey 's shoulder blade , and Sartaj could n't see how far down it went . ' What 's that from ? ' Sartaj said . ' She broke a Kashmiri walking stick on my back . This thick , it was , ' Mr Pandey said , holding up his thumb and forefinger circled . Sartaj walked to the window . There was a group of uniformed boys clustering around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . The St Mary 's girls were squealing , holding their hands to their mouths , and begging the boys to stop . In the drawing room , Mrs Pandey was gazing brightly at her husband , her chin tucked into her chest . ' Love , ' Sartaj said softly . ' Love is a murdering gaandu . Poor Fluffy . ' ' Namaskar , Sartaj Saab , ' PSI Kamble called across the station house . ' Parulkar Saab was asking after you . ' The room was some twenty-five feet across , with four desks lined up across the breadth of it . There was a six-foot poster of Sai Baba on the wall , and a Ganesha under the glass on Kamble 's desk , and Sartaj had felt impelled to add a picture of Guru Gobind Singh on the other wall , in a somewhat twisted assertion of secularism . Five constables came jerkily to attention , and then subsided into their usual sprawl on white plastic chairs . ' Where is Parulkar Saab ? ' ' With a pack of reporters .
