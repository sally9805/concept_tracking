On matters of import  --  Iraq , North Korea , terrorism , etc.  --  the world is as divided as ever . But on matters trivial , people of all colors , cultures and creeds seem to want the same thing : a brainless but catchy chorus and easy-to-learn dance moves . The Ketchup Song ( Hey Hah ) , written and sung by three Spanish sisters known as Las Ketchup , is the latest bit of happy ephemera bringing the world closer . It has reached No. 1 in 18 countries and is taking off on U.S. radio . You will not hear a dumber song this year , but its easy Andalusian vibe is more contagious than Ebola , and the nontoxic hook is pure joy . <P> Like its even more egregious older sister Macarena , The Ketchup Song started as a holiday hit . ( Europeans travel to Ibiza and return to their soggy homes with a sunny , exotic tune stuck in their heads . ) The genius of Ketchup is that its bouncy chorus  --  " Asereje ja de je de jebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  means the same thing in Spanish as in English : nothing . The words are a gibberish homage to the opening line of the first rap song , Sugar Hill Gang 's 1979 hit Rapper 's Delight . America 's familiarity with the original incomprehensible lyrics  --  " I said a hip hop , the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop , a you do n't stop "  --  have fueled Ketchup 's transatlantic voyage , while a simple six-step dance move has given it club life . <P> The Ketchup Song is n't available for purchase as a single . Columbia wants listeners to pay $18.98 for the bloated Las Ketchup album . Do n't fall for it . It 's like asking you to buy a burger and fries when all you really want is ketchup .  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
