<p> WASHINGTON - Junk e-mail used to be considered a minor inconvenience . <p> In the past , with e-mails from friends asking about your weekend plans and the latest joke passed on by your mother-in-law , you might have gotten a pitch from Amazon - a pitch you requested to receive . <p> But today dozens of offers for everything from bank loans to drugs that reverse the aging process comprise nearly half of all the mail you receive , according to a study by Ferris Research . <p> Spam-haters have had enough . <p> Even those who once argued for letting the junk e-mail problem work itself out in the free space of the Internet are calling for government crackdowns . <p> The undesirable babble filling in-boxes is being fought on three fronts : legal , technological and global . <p> A recent forum sponsored by the Federal Trade Commission in Washington , D.C. , held to collect ideas on fighting spam , heard from spammers and anti-spammers alike , and many worry that the benefits of e-mail may be in jeopardy . <p> Even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states now have laws regulating unsolicited bulk e-mail . Computer geeks are making millions crafting software to ignore unrequested messages peddling goods or services . And foreign countries are begged not to harbor spamming machines . <p> The war against junk e-mail is on . <p> The legal route <p> Regulating e-mail traffic has been met with disapproving eyes . But now , as lawmakers ' own e-mail boxes are overflowing with offers to increase their bust size and take part in great investment opportunities , advocates appear . <p> Virginia , which passed the toughest law against spammers earlier this month , can now throw misleading e-mailers behind bars . There are no laws yet in Texas , though the state House has passed a bill offered by Rep. Brian McCall , R-Plano . The legislation is still pending in the Texas Senate . <p> On the national level , legislation to curb the number of electronic ads is gaining steam in Congress . <p> " Four years ago , no one thought this was a serious problem , " Sen. Conrad Burns , R-Mont. , said . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take strong legislative action in order to solve this problem . " <p> Burns ' Can Spam Act is likely to be brought to vote in this session of Congress . <p> Swelling in-boxes have created improbable allies in the anti-spam effort . <p> Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , once explained to the House Judiciary Committee that spam was not a problem Congress needed to address . <p> " People know how to deal with spam now , " she said . " We have a delete button . " <p> The year was 2001 . <p> Fast forward to 2003 . Lofgren now has drafted legislation that would heavily fine those who abuse e-mail advertising . <p> " I know I was n't a likely source to advocate this , " she said . " But this problem ca n't be solved by technology alone . " <p> Few legal cases have nabbed illegal e-mailers , but as more laws are passed , more cases have arisen . <p> Illegal e-mailers , on the federal level , are ones who deceive readers through pyramid schemes and unsubstantiated claims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different and distinct laws . <p> For example , several states require the letters " ADV " perched in the subject line to alert readers that an advertisement lies within the correspondence . <p> Ronnie Scelson , one of the nation 's biggest spammers , said he is not against federal legislation . He does fear , however , that it wo n't be applied fairly . <p> " Really , they do n't want bulk mail , and that 's what it boils down to , " he said . " And it 's not their right to decide . Until they enforce the laws on everyone , what difference does it make ? There should be a standard , but we need protection , too . " <p> Scelson , who sends offers from several Texas insurance companies to millions of e-mail addresses , said those who provide his connections to the Internet are under constant pressure to cut off his service by anti-spam groups . The government , he said , has not been sympathetic to his pleas , nor have they provided protection . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get people destroying my cars . I 've had a ( Corvette ) stolen . I 've had someone throw a brick through a window . It 's a dangerous business . " <p> Many Texas lawmakers said they 'd be willing to consider spam legislation . <p> Don Stewart , a spokesman for Sen. John Cornyn , said the Republican worries about stepping on free speech rights but thinks legislation can be drafted appropriately . <p> " I could n't walk into schools and hand out Playboy covers to a kindergartner , but spammers can send an e-mail with pornography to my daughter , " Stewart said . " There 's a line with free speech . These are things we need to consider . " <p> During Cornyn 's tenure as Texas attorney general , he was an advocate of the telemarketing no-call list now the law in Texas . <p> Some lawmakers worry , however , that they will not be able to write effective legislation . <p> Sen. Norm Coleman , R-Minn. , said he wants to see government get involved but not ignore the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a significant interest in curtailing this problem , " he said . " But government is not going to stop it itself . We 're not smart enough . We need to work along with the techies and the private sector . " <p> Relying on technology <p> Spam-diverting software is now a multimillion-dollar industry . <p> Companies such as Brightmail and Giant Company Software make money selling products intended to stop junk e-mail from being downloaded . <p> Technology companies have been able to cash in on the junk mail problem because of the strain it puts on companies . <p> Dealing with all that junk e-mail is costing U.S. businesses and organizations $ 10 billion a year , according to San Francisco-based Ferris Research . <p> In addition , companies that provide Internet connections are being inundated with complaints from subscribers about junk e-mail . <p> American Online said it now blocks over 2 billion spam messages a day . That accounts for two-thirds of the e-mail coming into its servers every day , said Joe Barrett , AOL 's senior vice president for network operations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spam , it 's going to destroy e-mail , " Barrett said . <p> The FTC , which hosted the government 's first anti-spam forum this month , said techies need to catch up to spamming techniques and get ahead of them . <p> Techies do n't scare Scelson , the spammer for hire . <p> He 's been using computers for a long time and said he sees Internet filters not as a hindrance but as a challenge . <p> " When I first started with computers , they did n't have hard drives and floppies , " he said . " You did n't buy software back then , you wrote your own or you did n't have any . If you can block my e-mail , I can figure out a way to get it through . " <p> A global partnership <p> The largest problem facing those who want an end to spam lies outside the nation 's borders . Because U.S. authorities do n't have jurisdiction outside the country , that 's where junk e-mailers will move . <p> The FTC said it 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't found a solution yet . <p> " It 's certainly a problem , " FTC Chairman Timothy J. Muris said . " And one we do n't have an answer to . " <p> The problem outside the country may be graver than within U.S. borders . <p> Doug McLean , of the spam-stopping company Postini , said most e-mails do not appear to originate in the United States . <p> " They appear to be from countries like South Korea , Brazil , Japan and Singapore , " he said . " They may be originating in the U.S. and routed through these countries , but they are allowing this to happen . <p> " Legislation is a good idea , but with a number of spams coming from countries who do not respect our intellectual property laws , it will be difficult . " <p> Scelson said if his spamming business comes under too much fire in this country , he would n't hesitate to move abroad . <p> " If they want me to move my business offshore , fine , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll save money in taxes . " <p> <p> UNWANTED E-MAIL <p> The average consumer receives 110 junk e-mails each week . Here 's how some major providers compare : <p> AT &T; Worldnet 76 <p> EarthLink/MindSpring 89 <p> MSN Hotmail 106 <p> Yahoo ! 141 <p> AOL 154 <p> <p> SPAM BY THE NUMBERS <p> 40 Percentage of all e-mail messages that are spam .
