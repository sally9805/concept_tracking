Headnote So you want to be a millionaire ? Three days with America 's personal finance gurus and legions of their devotees . By Shawn Macomber // TO THE PASSERBY CAUGHT UNAWARES , the scene inside a small room within the gargantuan Boston Convention Center must have resembled a scene from one of those storefront mini-churches where congregants handle snakes and routinely speak in tongues . Three hundred men and women sat swaying on tightly packed lines of folding chairs , eyes tightly clenched in trance-like ecstasy as they beckoned an unseen paramour with circling comehither hands . Real estate guru Raymond Aaron had set off this bit of orgiastic mimicry during his Automatic Prosperity seminar by encouraging the audience to imagine money pouring into their lives . " Now , what sound would you make if money were pouring into your life ? " he murmured . The crowd began moaning loudly . A female voice cried out " Ooh la la ! A middle-aged man a few aisles away matched her with an " Uh huh , uh huh ... Oh yeah ! " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes suddenly wide , asked . " What if I gave you a box that was so powerful you could just declare what it is you wanted and it would come true , just like a paint-by-number box makes a kid a great artist . Would that be a powerful box for you to have ? " The crowd , acute amnesia attacking the portion of their brain where memories of their paint-bynumbers artistic career are stored , agreed this would indeed be a powerful box . " Well , I created it 23 years ago , " Aaron said . " Your goals with that system are going to achieve themselves automagically . " Pregnant pause . " ' Automatically " is a word I had to make up to express the phenomenon you will personally experience if you get this box . " Sensing some skepticism , Aaron promised an " iron clad guarantee " accompanied his box , a large copy projected on a screen behind him . Even apart from recognizing the dubious legal worth of any contract containing a word like " automatically , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know whatever a leprechaun promises , pots o ' gold are n't given up so easily . Also , Aaron 's chiding . " You guys compete for worst life , " suggested a lack of respect I worried might seep into his other dealings and his claim that " most Ph.D.s in Massachusetts today are driving cabs because they know a ... a ... a LOT OF STUFF , BUT THEY DO N'T HAVE ANY ENTHUSIASM ! " forced any Massachusetts cab connoisseur to take all other statements with a grain of salt . Nevertheless , when Aaron finally unveiled his " box " -a Golden Ticket toanupcomingthree-day seminar , assorted CDs , and hooks-reduced from the usual $3,800 to the low , low price of $697 , the crowd reacted . " Oh my God , I 've never seen anything like it , " Aaron said . " It 's a ... a ... a STAMPEDE ! " I craned my head around to watch a dozen people power-walking to the registration table , credit cards at the ready . Perhaps Aaron was hoping a stampede would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box ? No such luck . I heard Aaron proclaim behind me , " If you ca n't afford it , you better buy it . " When I turned back , he was hovering over the front row . hands on his hips , eyeing those of us still in our seats with something approaching disgust . " People who are still sitting here ... this is a microcosm of your life , " he said . His tone suggested this was no compliment . In the competition for worst life . I was clearly at least a semi-finalist in Raymond Aaron 's eyes . FOR TWO FULL , DAYS , the more than 10,000 people crowding the Learning Annex Wealth Expo were told in countless seminars and workshops that , at its absolute core , becoming a millionaire was mostly a matter of thinking like a millionaire ... and paying a handsome ransom to be guided to this higher consciousness . Despite having already paid $179 to attend an event with the tagline , One Weekend Can Make You a Millionaire , " no one seemed particularly miffed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some other expensive product or pricey seminar . Beautiful young women in tight white tank tops emblazoned with the giant red word " FUN " used their considerable allure to herd attendees into seminars on creative real estate ( " Make millions huying and selling real estate without ever buying and selling real estate ! " ) and questionable tax strategies ( " Protect your assets ! Declare yourself a corporation ! " ) . Once in , however , these children of Hamelin were left at the mercy of a bunch of twenty-something , clipboard-totinggeeks asking , " Alright , ready to get started ? Who wants to be rich ? " In the exhibit hall , attendees as diverse as America herself hauled overflowing bags from one mega-guru booth to another , proving dreams of wealth the great American unifier . Dozens of hucksters at smaller booths tried to capitalize on this budding entrepreneurial enthusiasm ( read : mania ) with a host of investment opportunities . Hoard gold and silver instead of cash ! No , forget gold and silver : Become a cappuccino machine wholesaler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rican resort huts are where the smart money is at . Invest in oil , in gas , in independent media , in cruise ships . The roving Wealth Expos which take place in several cities each year are but a few of the 8,000 events the 25-year-old Learning Annex claims to put on yearly to help people " make more money , improve their relationships , empower their lives and support personal and spiritual growth . " To this end , the Learning Annex employs speakers ranging from Larry King . Sarah Jessica Parker , and Henry Kissinger to Bishop Desmond Tutu , Barbara Bush , and P. Diddy . Imagine the collaborative possibilities ! Who would n't love to see Parker and Kissinger team up for " Sex and the Ho Chi Minh City " ? Some speakers at the Boston Expo were clearly chosen less for their business acumen than the marquee value of their name . George Foreman , for instance , told tales of Sonny Liston , Muhammad Ali , Joe Frazier , the conversion from boxer to itinerant Christian preacher that kept him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his forties to become the oldest man ever to be heavyweight champion of the world , and , perhaps most revealing , why he named all five of his sons George : " Ali hits you on the head . Frazier hits you on the head . How many names you gon na remember ? " Then as if he suddenly recalled his speech was supposed to have some entrepreneurial aspect , Foreman added , " If you want to be the heavyweight champion of the world in business , if you want to he the heavyweight champion of the world in real estate , you 've got to be willing to fight . " More than a few picked up on the language of their heroes and , sensingkindred spirits afoot , experimented . While listening to " monetary historian " Mike Maloney give his presentation on gold , a slight . middle-aged man offered me a breath mint and then immediately , awkwardly , asked for my contact info . " Well , you know what they say . " he offered apologetically when I declined to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It did n't take long wandering through this hypercnthusiastic milieu to feel like The Beverly Hillbillies ' Jed Clampett without a Jane Hathaway to shoo off the wallet vultures . Perhaps this was why the biggest lines in the hall were at the el cheapo massage tables . CHRIS JOHNSON 'S LIKENESS , cast in cardboard , seemed omnipresent , offering a wad of cash with one hand , an " It 's yours ! " finger pointing from the other . " Your lack of knowledge is like having a giant padlock on this giant money vault , as I like to call the U.S. government , " Johnson was telling the crowd attending his Free Money seminar as I took my seat . Like most gurus , Johnson had a sob story . He worked 60 hours a week at " a J-O-B " yet was nevertheless " dead , flat broke " until a kind man opened his eyes to the power of financing one 's start-up business with government cash . Johnson pulled his beautiful young Asian wife up on stage like a curvy human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't know the full extent of the largesse available to us until we sprung several hundred dollars for his educational packet , " There 's no reason why in the next two to four weeks you ca n't receive a grant for ten to forty thousand dollars . " he said . Do n't assume government handouts were solely for low-income families , Johnson advised . We should look to our own lives to find traits to capitalize on . " Let 's say you 're a disabled female entrepreneur from a minority group who is a veteran and had an alcoholic father growing up . " he said . A woman raised her hand and shouted with bingo parlor enthusiasm , " That 's me ! " " You are all set , " Johnson beamed . F ONE WERE TO BELIEVE Rich Dad , Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki , however , being all set in America today is an aberration , not the norm . In glossy booklets rained down upon us by an army of lackeys manning the massive Rich Dad booth , Kiyosaki warns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a gross unequality sic hut is dangerous to the stability of a democratic society . " This , too , is the theme of the book Kiyosaki coauthored with Donald Trump , Why We Want You to be Rich , which claims our nation is " going backward , into the Agrarian Age , when there was no democracy and only two classes . " Fear not the farming life , however , friends . Kiyosaki is making the world safe for democracy again with an educational board game , Cash Flow . Kiyosaki appears in the promotional booklet with a giant cartoon mallet poised to crush the dastardly financial advisor Y. Lee Weasel on behalf of investor Timid T. Turtle and invokes 1960s educator Edgar Dale 's Cone of Learning . " Looking at the Cone , " Kiyosaki writes , " you will see that reading is the worst way to learn . Second worst is hearing words ( lecture ) and third is looking at pictures ( movies , photographs and TV ) . " This explains alot . The American public school system has been wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cash Flow as " Monopoly meets Dungeons Dragons , " but it must have something else going for it to cost 195 real dollars . For a mere $595 , Kiyosaki will throw in the children 's version of the game and a few assorted Rich Dad knickknacks that would otherwise cost $904.60 separately . Talk about be low-the-poverty-line pricing ! Still , if , as Kiyosaki contends , his cardboard and plastic oracle has the power to prevent the fall of Western Civilization , it may seem greedy to charge such an obscene amount for it until one considers the following conversation between Donald Trump , Kiyosaki , and Kiyosaki 's wife Kim , transcribed in Why We Want You to be Rich : " That 's why I teach , write and croate board games , " Kiyosaki said . " It 's not for the money , although the money is good . There are far easier ways to make money . I teach and create educational materials out of a deep concern . I believe our country is in trouble and so are millions of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When you and I do Learning Annex talks , we often travel for two days , just to deliver a talk . That " s a lot of time and energy for a two hour talk . As you say , there are much easier ways to make money . " Kim and I nodded in unison . Kim , who teaches as well , added , " We all make more money , much easier money , in real estate and other investments . Yet teaching is our passion . It is passion that gets us on those planes to fly all day . spend a night , deliver a short talk , and then fly hack home . It 's sure not the money . " Leaving aside the question of whether rich entrepreneurs actually speak to one another like idiot savants behind closed doors , according to Learning Annex President Bill Zanker , Trump is paid a million dollars per speech . Kiyosuki , greeted like a rock star by the Learning Annex crowd , is probably similarly compensated . Sales are good , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of Why We Want You to be Rich from the Rich Dad super booth . Is there really an easier way to make money than selling $200 board games ? The bland class war rhetoric might feed a hero complex or help justify the outrageous gouging for cartoon board games , but if Kiyosaki thinks anyone is buyinghim as some altruistic saint , he 's been spending a bit too much time canoodling with Y. Lee Weasel . AFTER A QUICK BIT on how he was raised poor in a converted chicken coop in Michigan sans phone or running water . Las Vegas hypnotist Marshall Sylver fell into a masturbatory wealth reverie . The self-described Greatest Hypnotist of All Time and " leading authority in the field of subconscious reprogramming " beamed pictures on a half-dozen screens of his San Diego beach house and the Las Vegas mansion so big he recently discovered a bathroom he did n't realize existed . A purple Hummer with flames painted on the front and a video game console in the rear appeared next , followed by a $350,000 Rolls Royce Phantom , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not even a watch , it 's a small condo , " Sylver joked . Does all this seem a bit gauche to you ? Tell it to a psychiatrist ! " Your parents messed you up , " Dr. Sylver diagnosed . " They did n't do it on purpose . They thought they were helping you . They thought they were making you a better person by telling you not to show off . The truth is you need to show off . " " I do n't show you these things to impress you with me , " Sylver offered improbably , adding more probably , " It 's pretty clear I 'm already plenty impressed with me . " No , Sylver was showing us " paupers , " as he affectionately addressed us , what could be ours if only we would allow him to tinker with the subconscious wiring in our head . A video advertisement for his $1,500 weekend seminar showed people eating fire and hundreds slumped in chairs , hypnotized , apparently being " fixed . " Nonetheless , to prove his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those that are afraid to buy are always afraid to sell . " Sylver must be the bravest self-promoting hypnotist on his block . " You make you wealthy . " So why do I need to fork over $1,500 to you ? " Reality is created by validation . " Did n't you just call me apauper ? " If people are saying no to you a lot , it 's because you 're fun to say no to . If you 're fun to say yes to , they 'll say yes to you more often . " This explains the FUN girls . " You are the average of the five people you hang out with . And they suck . " Even a blind squirrel sometimen finds a nut . " Actually , they do n't suck . Theyjust have different aspirations than you . " Uh oh . Somebody is batting zero again . To the layman , this might seem underwhelming . But when Sylver noticed some were n't taking the reprogramming seriously , he lashed out . " Hey , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You do n't have to listen to me . You do n't have to take my advice . I 'm just a happy , healthy , well-adjusted multimillionaire . " This was a kind of hookend to somethingSylver said earlier in the day after he asked those of us who wanted to lose weight , get rich , and have a better sex life to raise our hands and too few of us did . " Fact of the matter is , if this is too much energy for you to put out on your own behalf then quite frankly your life is guaranteed to suck . " This was n't quite the same as the " iron clad " guarantee Raymond Aaron had promised a day previously , but ironically enough it was similar to an admonishment he delivered to a crowd not automagically entranced by his spiel . " Have you forgotten I 'm about to teach you how to be rich ? " Aaron asked . " Because you 're reacting like I 'm telling you how many cavities you have . Pretend you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm trying to teach you how to get rich and you 're being as resistant as you can . I 'M NOT LETTING HIM MAKE ME RICH ! NOOOOO WAY ! " Sylver encouraged us to use " freakin ' ' " as a middle name while introducing ourselves to the person next to us . " Do you feel that intense shift in your awareness ? " Sylver asked . Suddenly feeling like a chest-thumping frat boy , I had to admit my awareness had indeed shifted . Then Sylver got a woman to eat fire and tried to hit us up for the cash . When it was all over Sylver worked the crowd . An older gentleman explained that he did n't have $1,500 to spare outright but wanted to get started . " You can not purchase materials separately , " Sylver sniffed . " It 's time for you to get in in a full way , not just dip your toe in the pool . " TONY ROBBINS 'S REPUTATION precedes him in such a way that I genuinely believed after seeing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armful of books ready to seize the day . This was the man summoned to Camp David to buck up Bill Clinton after the 1994 election , after all . Nelson Mandela , Margaret Thatcher , and Mother Teresa have all reportedly called upon him as well . Why not me ? The six-foot-seven Ubermensch delivered a funny , inhumanly energetic performance . He pranced and bounced like a freed stallion to The Who 's " Teenage Wasteland . " He peppered his talk with colloquialisms like " No s-t , Dick Tracy , " entertaining stories about celebrities like Andre Agassi , and hilariously excessive interpretations of attitudes we must overcome . To wit : " I sure hope that woman over there knows I 'm attracted to her , comes over here , makes love to me , and then introduces herself . " Ultimately , though , I was not moved . Rohhins talked about the " physiology of negativity . " It sounded like a medical diagnosis until he illustrated the condition by asking us to greet people in our row as if doing so was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No offense to my fellow larval entrepreneurs , but , in my row at least , this was n't exactly method acting . " Now shake your body out ! " Robbins commanded , and 10,000 human pogo sticks bounced as one . Refreshed , Robbins asked us now to greet the people in our row as if we actually cared about them . " If that felt good , give the people seated around you a high five ! " Robbins shouted . A half-dozen people slapped and grabbed my hand . " Put your fist up and say " YES ! ' ' " Robhins recounted a trip to a Moscow hotel where a room service attendant swapped in an energetic " I 'll do it ! " for the typical surliness of her profession . " I thought . " S-t , this is going to happen , ' ' " Rohbins enthused . " Do n't you just love it when someone says , " I 'll try ' ' ? Do n't you just want to bitch slap them ? " Well , not exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all-female household as I did . ( In fairness to pimps , according to the Urban Dictionary , a hitch slap " denotes disrespect for the person being bitch slapped as they are not worthy of a man sized punch . " ) I must have been in the minority , though , because when Bobbins encouraged the crowd to chant " I 'll Do It ! " like Russian room service attendants , they did so . He 'd either really sold them on the idea or thousands were terrified of being individually bitch-slapped . Few would doubt Robbins has the stamina for such a feat . Robbins took a step back . The crowd went silent . He flashed that $81 million dollar-a-year smile . The applause was deafening . YET NO ONE WAS GREETED with the same fanfare as the final speaker of the weekend ; The lights went down , screens throughout the massive convention hall lit up with the words TRUMP IS IN THE HOUSE . Black plastic inflated wands embossed with TRUMP in gold letters were proudly brandished . People stood on chairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . The Apprentice theme song thundered . Gold confetti fluttered down . Finally , the developer and reality television star took the stage with a dozen dancing FUN girls . " Come here , sweetheart , " Donald Trump said to one of them . " Is my hair real ? " She touched it and nodded affirmatively . " It may not be pretty , but it 's mine , " the billionaire crowed . He received an almost **29;2015;TOOLONG response . Twelve thousand adoring wannabe multi-millionaire moguls did not abandon this enthusiasm when their hero declared " a lot of people are n't cut out , genetically or otherwise , to be entrepreneurs . " No one began to pogo Tony Robbins style to rid themselves of any " negative physiology " when Trump further offered that even some of those in their midst who were cut out for business would become " weeping , ineffective , scared people " under pressure . They were n't even millionaires yet-although if bulging shopping bags were any indication , most believed they were well on their way-and already Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hurt . I 've seen so many people get screwed . I 've seen fortunes taken away from people like it was candy . " The crowd cackled along with every barb , as if the idea of losing a fortune they had not yet even attained was so ludicrous as to eliminate even the slightest possibility that The Donald was speaking specifically to them . The person to my left or right ? Maybe . Me ? Never . Trump 's meager business advice ranged from banal exhortations to " do what you love " and " never , ever quit , " to considerably spicier promulgations such as , " If someone screws you , screw them hack with a vengeance , if for no other reason than people arc watching " ; " Get the best people and do n't trust them . You 've heard , " Get the best people and trust them ' ' ? That 's for idiots " ; and " Be a little paranoid ... I see some of you here with your friend and your wife . Your friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality show concepts before Survivor creator Mark Burnett pitched him The Apprentice . The problem was , most producers wanted to just follow Trump around the office . Trump insisted this would not work . " I meet with terrible people , " he said . " I meet with some real scum . And these are people who do n't want to be on television , although they 'd make great characters . They would make the had people on television as played by actors look like the nicest people you 've ever seen . " A ringing endorsement of Trump 's business partners , if nothing else . Later , at the launch of The Apprentice , Trump pointed out a " very handsome " star who his wife informed him was Rob Lowe . Lest we get the wrong idea , however , Trump insisted , " I do n't really like men . I like women . Of course , when I die they 'll say I was gay , you watch . " Why " Of course " ? Trump continued : " You see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they the they 're gay . " Grant and Flynn are n't two names that immediately pop into one 's mind alongside Trump 's , but ... " I do n't care if someone was guy or not . I mean , I grew up in New York . Forget it . I could n't care less . " Finally , perhaps dipping a toe in The Lady Doth Protest Too Much waters , he continued , " But just for the record , I 'm not gay . " So then why did Trump bring up Lowe 's oddly persistent pretty boy looks ? Why , to show how unlikely his rise to " major fricken television star " truly was . " Rob Lowe 's show lasted two weeks , " Trump said , " He was thrown off the air like a dog . Whoopi Goldberg , thrown off the air like a dog . There 's nothing nice about television business , it 's very simple-you do n't get ratings you get canceled . If you come up with a cure for cancer and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That 's how bad these frickers are . " And what did he say to the big time Hollywood agent who had begged him not to do The Apprentice when he called to congratulate Trump on hitting number one ... and to ask for a $3 million commission ? Why , " You 're Fired ! " of course . The man next to me stood up and cheered , fist in the air . " You 're Hired ! " signs were held aloft and given a vigorous shake . Most of the last third of the speech was devoted to the importance of prenuptial agreements , his own ( " If I did n't have a prenup with Ivana I 'd still ho in court , " Trump said , doing a pitch perfect imitation of Ivana protesting , " I did not know what I was signing ! " ) as well as Paul McCartney 's lack of one . ( " What did she ever do ? She never went on Ed Sullivan . She made him miserable for three y cars and now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his current prenup was " even better " than the one he had with Ivana . As the evening came to a close . Trump got about as near to resignation as one assumes he ever gets . " Look , I 'm going to kick the bucket , " he said . " My kids are going to fight over my estate- . They 're going to say I 'm an idiot whatever I do . " Still , moments later he added , " I like to think of myself as victorious . " When he encouraged the crowd to think similarly they banged their TRUMP wands together and roared for all they were worth , in an endorsement of a screwthe-world-I'm-rich ethos that the positive visualization crowd never really had a chance against . EARLIER THAT EVENING , the Learning Annex held a dance contest with a $1,000 prize . " Everybody Dance Now " blared . A few FUN girls worked the aisles picking semifinalists . Others gyrated on stage in black stretch pants . Ten contestants were brought up thrashing around as if it were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winnowed down . The last few contestants were asked to introduce themselves . One woman , a clear crowd favorite after her rendition of The Running Man , took the mic and shouted : " I 'm Pam ! And I 'm pregnant ! " " God love ya , " the host shot back , " and I hope the baby is O.K. ! " Pam won . The host asked what she would do with the money . " We 're going to invest it ! " she shouted . The crowd roared its approval . Hope , it seems , is not entirely dead in the Other America . Sidebar Foreman added , " If you want to be the heavyweight champion of the world in business , if you want to be the heavyweight champion of the world in real estate , you 've got to be willing to fight .
