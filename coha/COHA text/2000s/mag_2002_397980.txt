RESEARCHERS ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE WINTER BLUES AND WHY LESS SUNLIGHT CAN THROW OFF YOUR INNER CLOCK . HERE 'S HOW YOU CAN PULL YOURSELF OUT OF THE DOLDRUMS . // HANNAH MAY* IS A PAINTER AND EARTHY MOUNTAIN WOMAN . Energetic and prolific , she hikes through the Sierra Nevada with her easel and palette in tow . When the landscape is right , she pitches her tent and pulls out the canvas . So when her husband , Charlie , a chemist , got a job in Michigan , she thought she was in for a new adventure . But that following winter in Ann Arbor , when the days grew short and skies gloomy , she fell into a deep depression . " My wife paints wonderful landscapes . When we moved to the Great Lakes , her work became sporadic , " Charlie says . During the following summer , Hannah took a long trip to California and her mood and productivity picked up . The next winter , back in Michigan , her energy dipped radically once again . The couple had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctor confirmed that she was suffering from seasonal affective disorder . Photograph According to the National Institute of Mental Health , even blind people suffering from SAD can be helped by light therapy . Photograph People who so not suffer from full-blown SAD may experience an increased number of depressive episodes during the winter months . // Also known as SAD , the disorder affects some 10 million Americans . An additional 25 million Americans suffer from a milder form of the condition . For both severe and mild depressives , the problem may lie in the amount of sunlight they get . Less sunlight ( often ini northern latitudes ) can trigger symptoms such as cravings for sweets and carbohydrates , weight gain , low energy , sleepiness , social withdrawal and lack of interest in work . THE INNER CLOCK Interestingly , SAD has been found to be more common in creative people like Hannah . Poet Emily Dickinson showed seasonal changes of mood and productiv  --  ity in her writing . She wrote three times as many poems in the summers of 1858 and 1859 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And overall , her poems and letters written in winter tended to involve darker thoughts of loneliness and death , while letters and poems written in spring and summer were more joyful and optimistic in tone . Based on this and other data , a study in the American Journal of Psychiatry speculates that Dickinson may have had seasonal affective disorder . " Perhaps her sensitivity to the seasons was the same sensitivity that allowed her to write so beautifully , " suggests study author John McDermott , M.D. , professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Hawaii School of Medicine . In other patients with SAD , such as New York City interior designer Kate Smith* , the symptoms are many . When her SAD is at its worst , Kate may sleep some 12 to 16 hours a day , lose interest in work and exercise , crave foods like pizza and chocolate and isolate herself socially . Looking for a boost , she may drink up to three cups of coffee and six Diet Cokes a day ( double her usual intake ) yet feel no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what causes seasonal depression , researchers are making headway . In a recent study in the Archives of General Psychiatry , scientists reported that people with SAD generate a biological signal that the season is changing . This is similar to the type of cues bears get when it is time to hibernate . This signal , however , is absent in people whodo n't have SAD . Photograph // Just as researchers are learning more about the disorder , more treatment options are becoming available . In Hannah 's case , she opted to try natural supplements including Saint-John's-wort . " There was a marked difference . My mood and energy picked up , and I was painting a lot , " she says.1 Exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet also helped her stay on track . LIGHT OF DAY Another effective treatment is light therapy . Michael Terman , Ph.D. , director of the winter-depression program at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York says , " Using bright-light therapy to shift the internal circadian clock is the most effecfive intervention we know about . But prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has centered on this timing . In a study published last year in the Archives of General Psychiatry , Terman and his colleagues showed that the ideal time to administer bright-light therapy is about 2.5 to A hours after the midpoint of sleep , the optimal time for shifting the internal clock earlier . Terman says that timing the light this way can double the antidepressant response , when compared with light therapy used at any other time of day . So , if a severe case of winter blues is getting you down , talk to your doctor . Chances are , there is a light at the end of the tunnel .

Here are a few tips if you are thinking about treating yourself at home : &gt; Make sure your light box filters UV rays . &gt; Angle the box with the light shining into you eyes from above , not below . &gt; Standard treatment involves receiving light at 10,000 lux for 30 minutes . &gt; To avoid relapse , treatment should continue throughout the season . Sidebar BEYOND LIGHT THERAPY Sidebar THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL THERAPIES AND LIFESTYLE HABITS CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE WINTER BLUES : &gt; Melatonin : A study that appeared in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that the hormone melatonin may be effective for some people with insomnia . The study also found that the hormone may help wean older people with insomnia off benzodiazepine tranquilizers. &gt; Saint-John's-wort : The major antidepressant element in Saint-John's-wort may well be the compound hyperforin . In a recent study reported in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy , an extract containing 5 percent hyperforin better alleviated depression when compared with a placebo. &gt; 5-HTTP : The amino acid 5-hydroxtryptophan increases serotonin virtually without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as migraines and insomnia. &gt; Glucosamine : For joint pain , this cartilage-building sugar compound seems to slow joint damage . One study showed that glucosamine may be useful against knee arthritis , and other studies have found that it is as effective as ibuprofen for arthritis symptoms . &gt; Tea : Studies confirm that antioxidant chemicals called polyphenols are present in tea , namely in the black and green varieties . These chemicals help guard against basic cell damage . In one long-term Dutch study , subjects who drank the most tea had the lowest risk of death from coronary heart disease and stroke . &gt; Experts agree that regular exercise and a diet low in carbohydrates helps boost low energy .
