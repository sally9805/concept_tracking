The $200 Billion Colossus // What does the eight-hundred-pound gorilla do ? // Anything it wants to . // What ? s true of the eight-hundred-pound gorilla is true of the colossus that is the pharmaceutical industry . It is used to doing pretty much what it wants to do . The watershed year was 1980 . Before then , it was a good business , but afterward , it was a stupendous one . From 1960 to 1980 , prescription drug sales were fairly static as a percent of U.S. gross domestic product , but from 1980 to 2000 , they tripled . They now stand at more than $200 billion a year . Furthermore , since the early 1980s , this industry has consistently ranked as the most profitable in the United States  --  by a long shot . ( Only in 2003 did it fall from that position to rank third among the forty-seven industries listed in the Fortune 500 . ) Of the many events that contributed to their sudden great and good fortune , none had to do with the quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? ll give you an overview of the pharmaceutical industry  --  its meteoric rise and the recent , early signs of either a coming fall or an overhaul . I will not go into much detail here , I ? ll leave that to later chapters . What I want to do now is provide a quick look at what ? s under this rock when it ? s lifted . It ? s not a pretty sight . // Before I begin , a few words about the facts and figures I will use throughout the book . In most cases , I use data from the year 2001 , because it is the most recent year for which information is reasonably complete for all the aspects of the industry I will consider . If I stick with one year , it will make it easier to see the whole picture . But for some important facts , I will use figures from 2002 and , whenever possible , 2003 . In all cases , I will make it clear what year I am talking about . // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a $200 billion industry . According to government sources , that is roughly how much Americans spent on prescription drugs in 2002 . That figure refers to direct consumer purchases at drugstores and mail order pharmacies ( whether paid for out of pocket or not ) , and it includes the nearly 25 percent markup for wholesalers , pharmacists , and other middlemen and retailers . But it does not include the large amounts spent for drugs administered in hospitals , nursing homes , or doctors ? offices ( as is the case for many cancer drugs ) . In most analyses , they are allocated to costs for those facilities . // Drug company revenues ( or sales ) are a little different , at least as they are reported in summaries of corporate annual reports . They usually refer to a company ? s worldwide sales , including those to health facilities . But they do not include the revenues of middlemen and retailers . // Perhaps the most quoted source of statistics on the pharmaceutical industry , IMS Health , estimated total worldwide sales for prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half were in the United States . So the $200 billion colossus is really a $400 billion megacolossus , but my focus in this book will be mainly on how the drug companies operate in the United States . // You should understand , however , that it is virtually impossible to be precise about most of these figures . Before drugs reach consumers , they pass through many hands and are paid for in exceedingly complicated , often hidden , ways . It is easy to compare apples and oranges without knowing it . You need to ask , for example , whether a number refers just to prescription drugs or includes over-the-counter drugs and other consumer products made by drug companies ; whether it includes revenues for middlemen and retailers or not ; whether it refers just to outpatient consumer purchases or also to health facility purchases ; and whether it includes mail order purchases . // Let the Good Times Roll // The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was perhaps the most fundamental element in the rapid rise of big pharma  --  the collective name for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong pro-business shift not only in government policies but in society at large . And with the shift , the public attitude toward great wealth changed . Before then , there was something faintly disreputable about really big fortunes . You could choose to do well or you could choose to do good , but most people who had any choice in the matter thought it difficult to do both . That belief was particularly strong among scientists and other intellectuals . They could choose to live a comfortable but not luxurious life in academia , hoping to do exciting cutting-edge research , or they could " sell out " to industry and do less important but more remunerative work . Starting in the Reagan years and continuing through the 1990s , Americans changed their tune . It became not only reputable to be wealthy , but something close to virtuous . There were " winners " and there were " losers , " and the winners were rich and deserved to be . The gap between the rich and poor , which had been narrowing since World War II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yawning chasm. // The pharmaceutical industry and its CEOs quickly joined the ranks of the winners as a result of a number of business-friendly government actions . I won ? t enumerate all of them , but two are especially important . Beginning in 1980 , Congress enacted a series of laws designed to speed the translation of tax-supported basic research into useful new products  --  a process sometimes referred to as " technology transfer . " The goal was also to improve the position of American-owned high-tech businesses in world markets . The most important of these laws is known as the Bayh-Dole Act , after its chief sponsors , Senator Birch Bayh ( D-Ind. ) and Senator Robert Dole ( R-Kans . ) . Bayh-Dole enabled universities and small businesses to patent discoveries emanating from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , the major distributor of tax dollars for medical research , and then to grant exclusive licenses to drug companies . Until then , taxpayer-financed discoveries were in the public domain , available to any company that wanted to use them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , can patent and license their discoveries , and charge royalties . Similar legislation permitted the NIH itself to enter into deals with drug companies that would directly transfer NIH discoveries to industry . // Bayh-Dole gave a tremendous boost to the nascent biotechnology industry , as well as to big pharma . Small biotech companies , many of them founded by university researchers to exploit their discoveries , proliferated rapidly . They now ring the major academic research institutions and often carry out the initial phases of drug development , hoping for lucrative deals with big drug companies that can market the new drugs . Usually both academic researchers and their institutions own equity in the biotechnology companies they are involved with . Thus , when a patent held by a university or a small biotech company is eventually licensed to a big drug company , all parties cash in on the public investment in research . // These laws mean that drug companies no longer have to rely on their own research for new drugs , and few of the large ones do . Increasingly , they rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIH for that . At least a third of drugs marketed by the major drug companies are now licensed from universities or small biotech companies , and these tend to be the most innovative ones . While Bayh-Dole was clearly a bonanza for big pharma and the biotech industry , whether it is a net benefit to the public is arguable ( I ? ll come back to that ) . // The Reagan years and Bayh-Dole also transformed the ethos of medical schools and teaching hospitals . These nonprofit institutions started to see themselves as " partners " of industry , and they became just as enthusiastic as any entrepreneur about the opportunities to parlay their discoveries into financial gain . Faculty researchers were encouraged to obtain patents on their work ( which were assigned to their universities ) , and they shared in the royalties . Many medical schools and teaching hospitals set up " technology transfer " offices to help in this activity and capitalize on faculty discoveries . As the entrepreneurial spirit grew during the 1990s , medical school faculty entered into other lucrative financial arrangements with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the results has been a growing pro-industry bias in medical research  --  exactly where such bias doesn ? t belong . Faculty members who had earlier contented themselves with what was once referred to as a " threadbare but genteel " lifestyle began to ask themselves , in the words of my grandmother , " If you ? re so smart , why aren ? t you rich ? " Medical schools and teaching hospitals , for their part , put more resources into searching for commercial opportunities . // Starting in 1984 , with legislation known as the Hatch-Waxman Act , Congress passed another series of laws that were just as big a bonanza for the pharmaceutical industry . These laws extended monopoly rights for brand-name drugs . Exclusivity is the lifeblood of the industry because it means that no other company may sell the same drug for a set period . After exclusive marketing rights expire , copies ( called generic drugs ) enter the market , and the price usually falls to as little as 20 percent of what it was . There are two forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trademark Office ( USPTO ) and exclusivity granted by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . While related , they operate somewhat independently , almost as backups for each other . Hatch-Waxman , named for Senator Orrin Hatch ( R-Utah ) and Representative Henry Waxman ( D-Calif. ) , was meant mainly to stimulate the foundering generic industry by short-circuiting some of the FDA requirements for bringing generic drugs to market . While successful in doing that , Hatch-Waxman also lengthened the patent life for brand-name drugs . Since then , industry lawyers have manipulated some of its provisions to extend patents far longer than the lawmakers intended . // In the 1990s , Congress enacted other laws that further increased the patent life of brand-name drugs . Drug companies now employ small armies of lawyers to milk these laws for all they ? re worth  --  and they ? re worth a lot . The result is that the effective patent life of brand-name drugs increased from about eight years in 1980 to about fourteen years in 2000 . For a blockbuster  --  usually defined as a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Lipitor or Celebrex or Zoloft )  --  those six years of additional exclusivity are golden . They can add billions of dollars to sales  --  enough to buy a lot of lawyers and have plenty of change left over . No wonder big pharma will do almost anything to protect exclusive marketing rights , despite the fact that doing so flies in the face of all its rhetoric about the free market . // Riding High // As their profits skyrocketed during the 1980s and 1990s , so did the political clout of drug companies . By 1990 , the industry had assumed its present contours as a business with unprecedented control over its own fortunes . For example , if it didn ? t like something about the FDA , the federal agency that is supposed to regulate the industry , it could change it through direct pressure or through its friends in Congress . The top ten drug companies ( which included European companies ) had profits of nearly 25 percent of sales in 1990 , and except for a dip at the time of President Bill Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of sales remained about the same for the next decade . ( Of course , in absolute terms , as sales mounted , so did profits . ) In 2001 , the ten American drug companies in the Fortune 500 list ( not quite the same as the top ten worldwide , but their profit margins are much the same ) ranked far above all other American industries in average net return , whether as a percentage of sales ( 18.5 percent ) , of assets ( 16.3 percent ) , or of shareholders ? equity ( 33.2 percent ) . These are astonishing margins . For comparison , the median net return for all other industries in the Fortune 500 was only 3.3 percent of sales . Commercial banking , itself no slouch as an aggressive industry with many friends in high places , was a distant second , at 13.5 percent of sales . // In 2002 , as the economic downturn continued , big pharma showed only a slight drop in profits  --  from 18.5 to 17.0 percent of sales . The most startling fact about 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Fortune 500 ( $35.9 billion ) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ( $33.7 billion ) . In 2003 , profits of the Fortune 500 drug companies dropped to 14.3 percent of sales , still well above the median for all industries of 4.6 percent for the year . When I say this is a profitable industry , I mean really profitable . It is difficult to conceive of how awash in money big pharma is. // Drug industry expenditures for research and development , while large , were consistently far less than profits . For the top ten companies , they amounted to only 11 percent of sales in 1990 , rising slightly to 14 percent in 2000 . The biggest single item in the budget is neither R &amp; D nor even profits but something usually called " marketing and administration "  --  a name that varies slightly from company to company . In 1990 , a staggering 36 percent of sales revenues went into this category , and that proportion remained about the same for over a decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures for R &amp; D. // These figures are drawn from the industry ? s own annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and to stockholders , but what actually goes into these categories is not at all clear , because drug companies hold that information very close to their chests . It is likely , for instance , that R &amp; D includes many activities most people would consider marketing , but no one can know for sure . For its part , " marketing and administration " is a gigantic black box that probably includes what the industry calls " education , " as well as advertising and promotion , legal costs , and executive salaries  --  which are whopping . According to a report by the nonprofit group Families USA , the former chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb , Charles A. Heimbold , Jr. , made $74,890,918 in 2001 , not counting his $76,095,611 worth of unexercised stock options . The chairman of Wyeth made $40,521,011 , exclusive of his $40,629,459 in stock options . And so on . //    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
