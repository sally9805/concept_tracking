<p> JOHN WATERS still has the first record he ever stole . <p> It was " Tonight You Belong to Me , " a 1956 hit sung by two chirpy girls named Patience and Prudence , and the 9-year-old Mr. Waters loved it . He had never stolen anything before , but this future filmmaker was visiting a Read 's drugstore in suburban Baltimore with his parents when he looked at the seven-inch 45 and realized it would fit snugly in his coat pocket . And now , just in time for Valentine 's Day , the song is the opening track on the new album " A Date With John Waters . " <p> That purloined disc , with Liberty Records ' distinctive statue-with-a-torch logo , now sits with hundreds of other scratched and worn 45s from the ' 50s and ' 60s in a bureau drawer in Mr. Waters 's living room , on a quiet , wooded side street near Johns Hopkins University .

" The movies that would change my life I could n't see when I was that young . They would n't show movies condemned by the Catholic Church at the Towson Theater , but records I could get my hands on . " <p> Those records first shaped the taste for the bizarre , outlandish and sleazy that was later expressed in films like " Pink Flamingos , " " Polyester " and " Pecker . " Mr. Waters personally picks all the songs for his pictures , and the resulting soundtrack albums are delightful collections of songs you had never heard of and then ca n't forget , no matter how you might wish to . <p> Given that , it 's not surprising that two of his films have been turned into Broadway musicals .

( A film version of the Broadway version of " Hairspray , " to be directed by Adam Shankman , will open this summer . ) <p> " When I turn in a script , " Mr. Waters said , " I almost always turn in a complete soundtrack with it . The studio executives are always surprised when that happens , but the music is another character in the movies . I use the songs like a punch line or a costume . " <p> " One of my biggest influences when I was 10 years old was the record ' The Flying Saucer , Parts 1 and 2 , ' by Buchanan and Goodman , " he recalled . " It was one of the first records to sample other records , and it used them to tell a ridiculous story . That 's my whole career : using music to tell ridiculous stories .

" Tonight You Belong to Me " is followed by Elton Motello 's " Jet Boy Jet Girl , " a late- ' 70s new wave song with explicit lyrics about gay sex . Other key tracks include Mildred Bailey 's " I 'd Love to Take Orders From You " and Josie Cotton 's " Johnny , Are You Queer ? " as well as songs from two of Mr. Waters 's regular actresses : Mink Stole 's " Sometimes I Wish I Had a Gun " and Edith Massey 's " Big Girls Do n't Cry . " <p> The 14 songs are arranged to tell the story of an imaginary date that progresses from getting comfortable to getting hot to basking in the afterglow , all narrated by Mr. Waters 's witty liner notes . " Think I invited you over here to discuss the future of independent film ? " he writes . " Hell no , I 'm lookin ' for a little action and ' In Spite of Ourselves ' by John Prine and Iris DeMent ought to do the trick . ' Convict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! Put on a video . " <p> The album peaks with Ike and Tina Turner 's " All I Can Do Is Cry . " Over Ike 's wavering blues guitar riff , Tina delivers a long , agitated recitation about sitting in the back of a church and watching her ex-lover marry another woman . When she reaches the point where the rice is falling on the head of " my man , " her voice erupts into an unearthly , screeching wail . It 's a song that Mr. Waters listened to over and over again with his teenage best friend , Glenn Milstead , now better known to the world as Divine , the exaggerated drag queen Mr. Waters made a star . ( He died in 1988 . ) <p> " Ike and Tina were our role models , " Mr. Waters said . " When we saw them at a Dundalk union hall , Ike stood in the back like a Svengali in a shiny suit . He was scary in a pimpish way . And Tina was a ghetto vision , Jayne Mansfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you look at them on their ' Dynamite ' album , Tina 's wearing Springolators , those backless high heels that went flap , flap , flap , and that was a key part of Divine 's look . " <p> In the ' 60s Mr. Waters shifted his focus from music to movies . He blames the Beatles . " Parents liked the Beatles , " he said . " When you 're young , you should never like music your parents like . Some of my friends who are liberals are appalled when their kids like rap . Of course that 's why their kids like rap . I basically hated all music from the Beatles to punk . Punk put the danger back in music . " <p> Mr. Waters broke out of the cinema underground with " Pink Flamingos , " his 1972 picture about " the filthiest people alive . " He went on to direct mainstream stars like Johnny Depp , Kathleen Turner and Melanie Griffith . An occasional actor himself , Mr. Waters will play the Groom Reaper , the Alfred Hitchcock-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Til Death Do Us Part , " beginning March 19 . <p> But he has never forgotten the crucial role music played in shaping his aesthetic . He assembled his favorite holiday songs for the 2004 album " A John Waters Christmas , " and he hopes to follow up " A Date With John Waters " with a series of theme albums . He said he feels little guilt for his youthful larceny , which progressed from impulse to premeditation . Now he has to pay $25,000 apiece to use the same songs in his movies that he once stole to avoid paying 89 cents . " They got their money back , " he said of the record labels . Nonetheless he talked wistfully of those days when " a stolen record always sounded better than one I paid for . " <p> Kids today , he said , will never know the same thrill .
