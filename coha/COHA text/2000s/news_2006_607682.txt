<p> The season played out in four distinct acts , each more bizarre than the last , before concluding in much the same way it began . The Washington Redskins were consistently surprising  --  for better and worse  --  and never boring during the 2005 season , but in the end they left fans with the same lingering question going into next season : Will the offense ever catch up to the defense ? <p> The team 's six-game winning streak , and postseason march , ended Saturday in a second-round playoff game in Seattle . It was a game in which the offense was largely ineffective for three quarters , and failed to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the defense and special teams . The Redskins ' 20-10 defeat mirrored so many from the first two years of Coach Joe Gibbs 's second tenure as coach : too few yards and too few points . And , unlike in the earliest stages of this season , the team could not overcome those offensive deficiencies . <p> The Redskins , who finished 11-7 overall , entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facing one of the toughest schedules in the NFL . Yet they streaked to a shocking 3-0 start , plummeted into a 2-6 hole  --  wasting the equivalent of a half-season  --  then rallied to win their final five regular season games to reach the playoffs when they had little room for error . That winning streak , with the players bound to wearing their lucky white jerseys and white pants , carried over into the wild-card playoff game at Tampa Bay , with the Redskins winning , 17-10 , despite posting 120 yards , the lowest for a playoff victor . But the fourth act would be most painful , as the offense faltered again , and the season ended in the chilling rain of the Pacific Northwest . <p> " I certainly think that we accomplished a lot this year , " Gibbs said Saturday night in Seattle . " Our football team last year was 6-10 . I think the facts kind of speak for themselves , where we wound up on defense , and where we wound up on offense . " <p> The offense improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ; a year ago the Redskins were 21st in rushing and 31st in passing , while this season they were seventh in rushing and 14th in passing . Although those gains were noticeable , and resulted in receiver Santana Moss and running back Clinton Portis each breaking single-season yardage records , the Redskins still often struggled to score . In 18 games , including the playoffs , they averaged 21.4 points ; they were held to 17 points or fewer nine times ( including both postseason games ) , and they exceeded 24 points only five times . <p> " I 'm going to lean towards the positive and talk about what we have done offensively and what we have accomplished , because we 've come a long way , " quarterback Mark Brunell said . " I think we are going to go further . " <p> It likely will take more production from the offense for the Redskins to advance deeper into the playoffs next season . And a defense that has put together two stellar seasons must do so again . The Redskins could not duplicate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total defense  --  but in the second half of the season , few teams were better . Their defense produced more turnovers , big plays and touchdowns in that span than Washington 's 2004 defense did , and did not allow an opponent to score more than 20 points in the final seven games , including the playoffs . Over those seven games , opponents averaged 14.1 points as the Redskins finished in a 6-1 tear and played physical defense . <p> " Any time someone asks you if you 're surprised that you gave up 20 points , that 's a compliment to us , " linebacker Marcus Washington said . " It 's a compliment to all the defensive coaches and some of the competitors that we have on that side of the football . We got some guys who are going to hit you . You can ask Seattle most valuable player running back Shaun Alexander about that . We 're going to hit you . Ask Tampa tailback Cadillac Williams . If you watch the film , you know that the Redskins are going to get after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense hit highs and lows over the five months they played , but the season began just as 2004 ended , with the defense holding up the offense . In Week 1 , Washington sneaked by Chicago  --  the eventual NFC North division winner  --  without scoring a touchdown ( 9-7 ) ; won at Dallas on two late touchdown bombs to Moss after not scoring for 55 minutes ( 14-13 ) ; then beat Seattle , the team with the best record in the NFC , 20-17 , in Week 4 after a bye . They were 3-0 , in good playoff position on their way to a 5-1 finish in the NFC East and 10-2 mark against conference opponents in the regular season . <p> What followed was a disastrous run that prompted more questioning of Gibbs . Over their next eight games the Redskins won only twice , requiring a wild scramble to salvage the season . With Moss , acquired for former top receiver Laveranues Coles in the offseason , having a torrid start to his Redskins career , and Portis less effective , the Redskins began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , 36-0 , on Oct. 30 , the first time Gibbs was shut out in a regular season game , then in November blew three straight fourth-quarter leads to fall to 5-6 , with the defense uncharacteristically yielding big play after big play . <p> Gibbs called a veterans-only meeting after a 23-17 overtime loss to San Diego at FedEx Field , and , after a long meeting with his offensive staff , rededicated himself to the run . The defense , meanwhile , was finally getting healthy again , particularly the defensive line , and the timing of those factors produced one of the best late-season runs in franchise history . <p> " When we were 5-6 , everybody wrote us off , " Portis said . " So the guys would constantly fight and the defense would pick us up and carry us when we did struggle . " <p> Portis ran for 100 yards or more in each of the final five regular season games . Moss , after being blanketed for weeks , was able to get downfield again because so much attention was focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many turnovers through 11 games , caused 23 in the final seven , including several that shifted momentum in key games . Washington won back-to-back road games against St. Louis and Arizona , building some confidence , then topped 30 points in the final three games against division rivals  --  Dallas , the Giants and Philadelphia  --  to clinch its first playoff berth since January 2000 . <p> " We have a lot of character , and guys play real hard football , " Moss said . " Tough football . Regardless of how it looks , or how fluid it looks , we find a way . That 's what I like about it here . " <p> But even Moss was stung by the final result . The fourth act unfurled Saturday , resulting in a barren Redskins Park yesterday rather than a flood of players getting treatment and gearing up for the NFC championship game . <p> Again , the offense stumbled , unable to even gain a first down on most drives , and the defense played Seattle 's potent offense to a stalemate for the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdowns , lost three fumbles and lost Alexander to a first-quarter concussion , but Washington 's offense never made them pay for their mistakes , and fell 10 points short . <p> " Every player on this team is trying to get to that championship game that the Seahawks are going to next weekend , " Moss said . " If you 're not there , you can pat yourself on the back and say a job well done , but there 's always going to be some emptiness in your heart knowing you got so close and did n't make it . "
