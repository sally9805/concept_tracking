" Remember , man , that thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return . " <p> Father Dowling murmured this formula as he traced a cross on the foreheads of the old people who advanced up the middle aisle of St. Hilary 's on this Ash Wednesday . Remember , man . No feminist had ever objected to this inclusive term , perhaps wanting to think of it as gender specific . Like All men are mortal ? <p> It was the rheumy eye of Monica Garvey staring into his as he applied ashes to her forehead that prompted these irreverent thoughts . Monica was known to complain about the Church 's treatment of women , thereby earning the friendly enmity of Marie Murkin , the parish housekeeper . Monica turned and made way for the next penitent . Roger Dowling switched to the Latin formula when Kevin Brown stood before him , eyes closed , head thrust forward . <p> " Memento homo quia pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris . " <p> Kevin 's lips moved as he repeated the words silently . Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass at Christmas , and the first issue had arrived some weeks before . Father Dowling said Vatican II 's Novus Ordo in Latin once a week , on Mondays , and the attendance noticeably rose . <p> " Why only once a week , Father ? " Kevin asked . <p> " After years of English it takes some getting used to . " <p> " People love it . " <p> It was partly nostalgia , of course . There were few people who , like Kevin Brown , understood Latin . He had studied it as a boy at Quigley when he had thought of becoming a priest . But he had gone on to Loyola and then to law school , prospered , married , had half a dozen disappointing children about whose souls he now fretted . " Thank God , Bridget never saw how they turned out . " It seemed that none of them went to Mass anymore . With Kevin there might have been an element of affectation in his championing the return to Latin in the liturgy . A pharisee thanking God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unfair . Kevin seemed to think that it was the Church 's dropping of Latin that had led to the falling away of his children . <p> Father Dowling finished distributing ashes and went into the sacristy feeling that his Lent was off on the wrong foot . Uncharitable thoughts , first about Monica and then about Kevin . God knows he had few aggravations in his pastoral work . Other pastors had to contend with the uprising of laypeople , women lectors who altered the Scriptures as they read , male clerical wannabes hovering about the pastor , a platoon of aids called ministers . Father Dowling realized he was in charge at St. Hilary 's as others longed to be in charge of their own parishes . A mild feminist and a man who missed the Latin of his youth scarcely added up to a cross . Most of those who had been to the noon Mass and stayed for the distribution of ashes would now return to the parish center in the former school . <p> A man shuffled into the sacristy , a smudge of ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the last in line . <p> " I hope it was all right , Father . " He pointed to his forehead . <p> " Why would n't it be ? " The man had not come to communion . Did he think he must confess before receiving ashes ? <p> " I 'm not a Catholic , Father . " <p> " Ah . " <p> " I meant no disrespect . " <p> " It 's perfectly all right , " Father Dowling said . " It 's not a sacrament . Just a reminder of our mortality as Lent begins . " <p> " Quite a turnout . " <p> Father Dowling guessed him to be in his late sixties , maybe more . His complexion was colorless and seemed paler because of his white hair . <p> " Most of them came over from the parish center . You might want to look into it . " <p> The man seemed puzzled , so Father Dowling explained the use to which he had put the school when there were no longer enough kids in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it exactly ? " the man asked . <p> " Look , come have lunch with me . Mrs. Murkin does n't like me to be late . " <p> " Mrs. ? " <p> " The housekeeper . " <p> " I do n't want to intrude . " <p> Father Dowling said , " She likes it when I ask people to join me . " She liked anyone with an appetite greater than his . On the way to the rectory he asked the man his name and so was able to announce it when they passed through the kitchen . <p> " Mr. Green , Marie . Nathaniel Green . He has agreed to have lunch with me . " <p> Marie harumphed . " On Ash Wednesday ? Some treat . " <p> " I 'm not Catholic , " Green said . <p> Marie gave him the fish eye . " I made no provisions for that . You 'll have to fast and abstain with Father Dowling . " <p> Marie made it sound like bread and water . But it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Marie put before them . <p> " I was telling Mr. Green about the parish center , Marie . " <p> " You retired ? " Marie asked their guest . <p> Green smiled . " Is that a requirement ? " <p> " No , " she said , " and you do n't have to be Catholic , either . Many of them will be older than you . " <p> Marie 's manner with Green was brisk and oddly distant . She swept into the kitchen ; the door swung to and fro and then stopped . <p> " I have been in a rectory before , " Nathaniel Green said . " Before I married . " <p> " You married a Catholic ? " Father Dowling said . <p> " I used to be a Catholic myself . " <p> " Did you get tired of it ? " A light note seemed best , given the way Green had introduced the subject . <p> " After her death , I just let it go . " <p> Father Dowling nodded . Every life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gather that was n't recently , " he said . <p> " No . " " And now you 've come back . " <p> " You make it sound easy . " <p> No need to press it now . If Green had come to church on Ash Wednesday , that might mean something , and then again it might not . <p> " Why do n't you let Marie take you over to the parish center and introduce you around ? " <p> " Oh , I 'm sure she 's too busy , " Green protested . <p> From the kitchen came a voice . " Give me five minutes and I 'll take him over .
