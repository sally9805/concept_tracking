It 's heavy work , but using the right sequence and tools makes the job easier . WHAT YOU 'LL NEED TOOLS : Drill , screw gun , drywall lift , tape measure , utility knife , drywall square , holesaw , C-clamps , cutout tool , drywall saw , hammer , dust mask , goggles MATERIALS : Drywall panels , drywall screws , scrap wood blocks Installing drywall  --  aka wallboard and Sheetrock ( a U.S. Gypsum brand name )  --  is n't light work . The typical drywall panel measures 4 x 8 ft. , is in. thick , weighs about 53 pounds and can be very awkward to maneuver . That 's the bad news . The good news is that it 's inexpensive , not terribly complex for a DIYer to install , and it produces a first-rate interior surface . The product comes in a variety of sizes and thicknesses . In addition to 4 x 8s , you can usually get longer panels  --  in 2-ft. increments up to 16 ft.  --  on special order . The thickness ranges from to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/8 , and 5/8 in . All can be used on ceilings and walls as long as the framing members are on 16-in. centers . If you plan to apply texturing to your ceiling , 3/8 in. is n't viable . If you need to install a firewall  --  between , say , your garage and living area or around your central heating system  --  many codes require 5/8 in . The - in. - thick panel is by far the most common because it performs well in most situations . But it is important to check your local building codes . Regardless of their size , most panels are constructed in the same way . The ends are full thickness , but the long sides are tapered toward the edge of the panel . This taper is about 1 in. wide , along the length , and about 1/8 in. deep . When two panels are abutted , edge to edge , a depression is created to accommodate the compound that 's needed to finish the joints . Because the board ends do n't have tapers , finishing these butt joints is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it 's best to avoid butt joints whenever possible , even if you have to waste some material . For this project , we installed drywall in a typical two-story house . This gave us the chance to try out a number of techniques before settling on the ones shown here . We paid attention to things that made the job easier  --  even if they took a little longer or cost a little more . And we tried to make special note of methods that would allow one person to do the job . We 'll leave taping and finishing for another article . Getting Started Begin by marking the location of all framing members on their adjacent surfaces . For the ceiling , that means marking the top plates just under the ceiling joists 1 . For the walls , it means marking the floor under each stud 2 and marking the ceiling panels , once they 're in place , to show where the tops of the studs fall . Plan to install all of the panels perpendicular to the direction of the framing members . Start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Begin work on the ceiling . Using a felt pen , mark the centerline of all the ceiling joists on the top plates . Photograph : 2 . Continue to locate framing members . Mark the centerline of all wall studs on the subfloor . We used 1-in. drywall screws to attach our - in. panels , though 1-in. drywall nails are a suitable alternative . We prefer screws because they hold better and are only marginally harder to install . If you have a variable-speed drill , that 's all you need to drive the screws . But if you have a lot of work to do , renting or buying a drywall screw gun is a better idea . This tool has an adjustable nosepiece that regulates the depth the screw can be driven . When set properly , the gun should drive the screw just below the panel surface . The screw should compress , but not tear , the backing paper . Nails also need to be driven to this depth . While a screw gun is a nice convenience , a drywall lift is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We rented a lift like the one shown here  --  it cost us $35 a day  --  and the ceiling work became nearly effortless for one person , a complete breeze for two . Ceilings Beginning at one ceiling corner , measure across to the ceiling joist 's center just at , or under , the 8-ft. point . Then , transfer this measurement to the front surface of a panel . Mark this length at the top and bottom edges of the panel , and connect the lines . Make a cut along this line using a sharp utility knife and a long metal straightedge , or invest in a drywall square .3 Photograph : 3 . Cut along the line with a sharp utility knife . Use a long metal straightedge or a drywall square to guide the cut . Once you 've scored the surface , move to the back of the board and place your knee just behind the cutline . Break the board against your knee by pulling back on the two sides 4 . After the board snaps , cut the backing paper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 4 . Stand the panel on edge and place your knee on the back side just behind the cut . Break panel by pulling it toward you . Tip the support platform on the drywall lift into the vertical position , flip down the support brackets and engage the foot brake on the bottom of the lift . Then lift the panel onto the brackets 5 , centering it from side to side , and tip the platform so it 's in the horizontal position . Elevate the drywall panel to ceiling height by turning the lift wheel in a clockwise direction . Photograph : 5 . Position the lift near the panel and engage the brake pads on the bottom . Place the panel finish-side down . Once it 's where you want it , force the panel against the joists by tightening the wheel ; then attach the panel to the joists with screws or nails 6 . When the fastening is complete , lower the platform by releasing the handbrake and turning the wheel counterclockwise . Photograph : 6 . Move the panel into position , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drywall screws driven into the joists . When you reach an electrical outlet or other opening in the ceiling , measure from the adjacent panels 7 , in both directions , and transfer these dimensions to a new panel . All of our light fixture outlets were covered with round plaster covers , so a holesaw of slightly larger diameter than the cover was the best tool for cutting the openings . Photograph : 7 . For lights and other ceiling obstacles , measure the distance from the adjacent panels to the opening 's center . Walls Begin at the top of the walls  --  this will yield the tightest joint along the ceiling and minimize the possibility of cracks developing later . The simplest way to temporarily support the panels is to screw or tack nail a support block to the studs at both ends of the panel . Position these blocks 48 in. below the ceiling to allow for some adjustment . We lifted each panel 8 and rested it on the blocks . Then we positioned it from side to side , pushed it tight against the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With walls , the lift is n't so important . One option is to rest the panel on blocks attached to the studs . On partition walls , where no insulation was in the way , we found that a couple of C-clamps were just as effective as the support blocks . We simply tightened the clamps at the proper height and set the panel on them 9 . Both the blocks and clamps worked faster than the lift , but the lift required less effort . To use it , cut your panel to size , load it on the bracket and elevate it to within an inch of the ceiling 10 . Engage the foot brake and tip the panel until the top edge hits the wall . Make sure the bottom edge is still engaged in both support brackets . Then , crank up the lift wheel until the top of the panel abuts the ceiling . Drive at least six screws along the top edge of the panel . Release the tension on the lift wheel and let the bottom of the panel swing against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another temporary support option for partition walls is a C-clamp . Tighten it to a stud and lift the panel onto it . Photograph : 10 . Use the lift to raise a panel to within 1 in. of the ceiling . Tip the top of the panel against the wall , then lift . Cutouts You can cut an opening in a panel before or after it 's installed . Doing it afterward is best accomplished with a cutout tool  --  a portable electric tool similar to a laminate trimmer . When outfitted with a special bit , the tool quickly cuts openings by following the surface of the framing members 11 . The tool we used was Porter-Cable 's model 7499 . You can rent it or a similar one for about $20 a day or less . Regardless of cutting method , be sure the cutout hole corresponds to the outside perimeters of electrical boxes and door or window jambs . Photograph : 11 . Use a cutout tool for window and door openings . Install the whole panel , then rout around the interior perimeter . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they nearly eliminate mistakes in measurement . But if you 're doing just one room , the traditional method makes more sense . All that 's required is to measure the location of the opening from the adjacent panels 12 , transfer the position to a new panel 13 and make the cut with a drywall or keyhole saw .14 Photograph : 12 . To locate switch and receptacle outlets , measure from the adjacent panels installed on the side and on the top . Photograph : 13 . Mark outlet dimensions on the face of the panel . Then , outline the box opening using a felt pen . Photograph : 14 . Cut outlet openings with a drywall or keyhole saw . To prevent breakage , support the underside of the panel . You also can use a cutout tool to make cuts around electrical outlets 15 , but the technique requires some practice . First , turn off any electrical service to the outlet , then measure the location of the middle of the box . Push the self-drilling bit into the panel and move it in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carefully lift the bit over the edge so it bears against the outside wall of the box . Move the tool counterclockwise , and when the cut is complete , pull out the waste . The panel should fit perfectly around the box . Photograph : 15 . To use a cutout tool for outlets , drive the bit through the center of the opening , then run the bit to the box 's side . Though it 's best to leave a 1/16-in. to 1/8-in. gap between panels at all joints , occasionally the fit will be too tight . Do n't tap the panels with the face of a hammer  --  a crack will almost certainly occur . Instead , place a scrap block flat against the joint and tap the block with a hammer 16 . This will spread the blow across a larger area and reduce the chance of breaking the panel . After all the panels are temporarily fastened in place , finish the installation by driving the rest of the fasteners . Drive screws or nails every 6 or 7 in. around the perimeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Photograph : 16 . If the panels fit too tightly to lie flat , use a hammer and a wood block to force the ends together . Tap along the joint . <p>
