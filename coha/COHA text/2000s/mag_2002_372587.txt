Bob Howard knew his company had a problem when he found himself dreading the good times . His firm , Sioux Chief Manufacturing of Peculiar , Mo. , makes water-hammer arresters , which stop pipes from clanging . When demand periodically surged , the 350-person company was overwhelmed trying to handle the workload . " We had to do a lot of overtime , pull people off other departments , beg customers to take partial delivery of orders , " says Howard , 61 , Sioux Chief 's materials manager . " It cost us money . " <P> Finally Sioux Chief 's managers sat down to figure out how to avoid such crises . Demand for arresters  --  and for many of the 7,000 other products the company makes  --  is affected by the weather , the economy and changes in building codes . What Sioux Chief really needed was a fortune-teller  --  and now Howard has that job . His crystal ball : a $4,995 Forecast Pro software program from Business Forecast Systems , based in Belmont , Mass . These days Howard 's prophecies help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used sophisticated statistical software programs for years . But with the sizzling speed of new desktop computers , the calculations that used to take 10 Ph.D.s weeks to complete can be accomplished in a few minutes by a purchasing manager with a bachelor 's degree . As a result , smaller companies are catching on . <P> Manufacturers are n't the only businesses that can profit from forecasting software . Internet companies use it to predict when their sites will get the most hits so their servers do n't crash . Credit-card companies calculate who is likely to default . And looking at such factors as employees ' ages , salaries , number of years on the job , how often they have changed jobs in the past and opportunities in their fields , human-resources departments predict which employees are most likely to quit . <P> Forecasting can even save lives . Analyzing variables from claims , patient surveys and lab tests , health plan Hawaii Medical Associates of Honolulu identifies which of its 40,000 diabetic members are most likely to end up in the hospital . A consultant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cary , N.C. , sometimes finds patterns that do n't appear in any medical textbook . " Someone with high cholesterol , diabetes and one hospitalization may not be at the same risk as a person with the same profile on a certain type of medication , " says medical director Richard Chung , " but the program would find that . " The health plan then mails these patients pamphlets about diabetes as well as reminders about the need for tests or has a nurse phone them to offer advice . " The cost of hospitalization has fallen dramatically , " says Chung , who estimates that his company saved more than $10 million in its first year of using the $100,000 software . <P> Specialized forecasting software comes equipped with an assortment of statistical tools and can be set to apply techniques automatically that normally only an expert statistician would know about . The software manufacturers offer consultation at an added cost , but many customers are able to use the programs right out of the box .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
