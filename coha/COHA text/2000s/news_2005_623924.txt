<p> In 1805 , Francois Clicquot died of a fever , leaving his 27-year-old wife , Barbe Nicole Ponsardin , to run his family 's Champagne business . <p> The widow ( veuve in French ) knew little about wine production , yet seized the moment , inventing the riddling table that is still used today , and building a company so successful that one of France 's finest Champagnes , Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 's La Grande Dame , is named for her . <p> Two hundred years after the widow joined the male-dominated French winemaking world , America 's own sparkling " grande dame , " Jamie Davies , celebrates her 40th winemaking anniversary . <p> In 1965 , Davies and her husband , Jack , purchased a ramshackle Victorian house , a winery and vineyards established in 1862 by German immigrant Jacob Schram in Calistoga , turning it into Schramsberg Vineyards , producer of arguably the finest sparkling wines in the United States . <p> " The property just popped out to us , and we said , ' This rundown old lady needs lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petite , soft-spoken woman whose stature belies her internal strength and sharp mind . " We did n't have a wine style then , but we knew we did n't want to be , ' Me , too ' winemakers . Some of our neighbors were not improving quality , and they felt their wines were good enough as is . We decided to do something that no one else was doing . " <p> That something was sparkling wine , made with the same labor-intensive methods used in Champagne , called methode champenoise , where still wine made from Chardonnay , Pinot Noir and sometimes Pinot Meunier grapes undergoes a secondary fermentation in the bottle , creating the bubbles . The bottles are stored for several years , allowing the post-fermentation yeast cells to remain in contact with the wine , giving it a biscuity character and complexity . <p> " We did our homework before we got here , " says Davies with a laugh , meaning sipping Champagne at parties . " We asked ourselves , ' What 's missing here ? ' It was sparkling wine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 , and it was with some sadness , and also great pride , that Jamie completed this year 's circuit of anniversary celebrations held at the Diamond Mountain winery and at special dinners across the country . <p> The Davies were equal partners in the business , each with areas of expertise . Jack was the winemaker , the businessman , the man who spearheaded the creation of the Napa Valley Agriculture Preserve to ward off development , and helped prevent a four-lane freeway from splitting the valley in two . <p> Jamie is the creative force , the marketer , the hospitality director , the landscaper , the campaigner for the belief that sparkling wine is n't just for weddings , New Year 's Eve and the launching of ships . She has lost count of the number of tours she 's given of the nearly 2 miles of aging caves and tunnels first dug out of the hillside by Chinese laborers hired by Schram . <p> Like Ponsardin , Davies took control after Jack 's death , seeing Schramsberg through several changes , including the replanting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth and hillside exposure above Calistoga . <p> The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vines that were pulled out to make room for Cabernet Sauvignon were replaced by purchased fruit from much cooler regions like Carneros , Marin County , Mendocino County 's Anderson Valley and Monterey County , where the grapes achieve the ripeness and acidity levels beneficial to making fine bubbly . <p> Already the first in the United States to produce blanc de blancs , blanc de noirs , brut ros and a prestige cuvee using methode champenoise , Schramsberg also is a pioneer in barrel-fermenting and barrel-aging some of the base wines that become sparklers . <p> With the exception of the well-made , moderately priced Mirabelle California Brut ( $20 ) and $36 Querencia Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma Counties Brut Ros ( sales proceeds support the Jack L. Davies Land Preservation Fund ) , Schramsberg 's sparklers are vintage-dated , reflecting the variances in growing seasons that nonvintage blends do not . <p> From a first-year production of 250 cases , Schramberg now makes 50,000 cases per year of sparkling wine and 1,000 cases of J. Davies Diamond Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 from grapes grown on the property . <p> Recent vintages of Schramsberg wines show an increasing depth of both flavor and finesse ; they are Californian in their fruit intensity and French in their natural acidity and structure  --  a most happy medium . <p> The fine-textured 2001 Schramsberg California Blanc de Blancs ( $33 ) , which received a three-star " excellent " rating from The Chronicle last week , offers fragrant aromas of lemon zest , ripe peach and baked bread , with a palate that is creamy and lively at the same time . <p> Also " excellent " is the 1999 Schramsberg J. Schram **30;5045;TOOLONG Counties prestige cuvee ( $80 ) , with superb weight and structure , exotic fruitcake , ginger , pear and peach flavors and a gentle toastiness . ( See Page F4 for reviews of Schramsberg 's blanc de noirs and brut ros wines . ) <p> " The quality of our wines has evolved , " says the Davies ' youngest son , Hugh , 40 , the company 's president and winemaker . " It begins with our collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is where it starts . We 've gravitated to the cooler pockets of California , to get the fruit intensity along with the development of natural acidity . <p> " Then we can merge the complexity dimension of the fruit with barrel fermentation and increased aging time in the bottle . " <p> The Davies , who had a bit of enological experience after being short-time investors in Martin Ray Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains ( now Mount Eden Vineyards ) , could not have tackled a more difficult winemaking task than methode champenoise . At the time , Beaulieu Vineyard in Rutherford made a small amount of bubbly , and Hanns Kornell in Calistoga and Korbel Champagne Cellars in Guerneville ( Sonoma County ) produced sparkling wines using grapes other than Chardonnay and Pinot Noir . Schramsberg was the first to make significant amounts of sparkling wine the Champagne way , using Champagne 's grapes . <p> It was even called Champagne until the 1990s , which angered the French , who insisted that only the Champagne region could produce Champagne . The Davies dropped " Champagne " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . <p> In 1965 , Jamie  --  eight months pregnant with Hugh  --  moved into the dilapidated , 1860s house on remote Diamond Mountain . She already had two sons , ages 4 and 3 . Jack , an executive with Ducommon Inc. , a pipe and steel distributor in Los Angeles , commuted back and forth for the first year . <p> Jamie and kids were surrounded by forest , some 6 miles from civilization  --  Calistoga to the north , St. Helena to the south . <p> The property had a series of owners since Jacob Schram 's death in 1905 , and although it had been made famous by Robert Louis Stevenson in his book , " The Silverado Squatters , " the estate had been abandoned since 1960 . In 1965 , windows were broken , plaster was falling off the walls and bats flew out of the attic . Jamie swatted them with a tennis racket . The vineyard was overgrown with blackberry bushes . There were no next-door neighbors . <p> " It was insane , " Davies says . " Insane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tractor scolded Jack : " Mr. Davies , you have some nerve bringing your wife to this place , " Jamie recalls . " The couple left because she could n't take it . It was too uninhabitable ; 6 miles seemed like 60 to some , I guess . <p> " Everywhere we looked , there was a challenge . If we knew then what we know now , would we have done it again ? Yes . We felt secure and believed we had a very secure environment for our children . We loved the thrill of re-creating a world that had died out , the thrill to reproduce history and make it live for the next generation . " <p> Even crushing their first load of grapes in 1965 was challenging . With friends , neighbors and investors looking on , the button was pushed to start the press and ... nothing happened . As Jamie tells it , from the back of the room , Russian-born Beaulieu enologist Andre Tchelistcheff cried out , " Madame , your duty is clear ! " <p> " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grapes , " Davies says . " I took off my shoes and socks and went to work . " <p> The Davies boys grew up tending the garden , feeding the domesticated animals and absorbing the nuances of the wine business . Hugh made wine in Champagne , got an enology degree at UC Davis and now runs the winery . Brother John , 41 , is in the hedge fund business in Moscow . Bill , 43 , used to handle sales and marketing at the winery and remains on the board of directors . He struck out on his own in 2000 with Tom Gamble to found the Source-Napa wine brand ( formerly Origin Napa ) and manage Napa Free-Range Beef . <p> The Davies also have a second family , their employees , many of whom arrived in Napa Valley years ago from Mexico . One , master riddler Ramon Viera , has been with Schramsberg 30 years , arriving in the valley to play soccer . With the spot on the soccer team came the job . <p> Viera turns thousands of sparkling-wine bottles ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead yeast cells  --  gently collects in the necks of the inverted bottles ; the process is known as " riddling . " The sediment is later expelled and the bottles corked . The racks holding the bottles are similar to the riddling table devised by widow Clicquot 200 years ago . <p> Viera turns 30,000 bottles a day and can do up to 50,000 . " His hands just float over the bottles , " Davies says . <p> " We 're small and we do n't have a lot of jobs , " she says . " But this whole thing is based on family and it just took off . I think the people who work for us understand that . " <p> As she said in 2001 , " When Jack passed away , ( our employees ' ) response was overwhelming , an outpouring of love . Real people make real things and inspire each other . " <p> Upon arrival at Schramsberg , Jamie and Jack sought the advice of UC Davis enology professor Maynard Amerine . <p> " Amerine thought it unusual at best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winemaking , " Davies says . " He told us that Dimitri Tchelistcheff ( the son of Andre Tchelistcheff ) was the only one with any expertise in sparkling wine , so we visited Dimitri at Bodegas Santo Tomas ( winery ) in Baja , Mexico , where he worked . He agreed to help . <p> " A lot of people were interested in us city slickers  --  they did n't know whether to applaud or laugh . Many thought we would spend a lot of money and just be useless . We took on partners , and that was both the easy part and the scary part . We had backing , but we also had to move forward . " <p> The former Jamie Peterman grew up in Pasadena and graduated from UC Berkeley , where she was a member of Delta Gamma . With sorority sister Wanda Hansen , she became an art dealer-promoter in San Francisco , before marrying Jack in 1960 at Memorial Chapel at Stanford University and starting a family . <p> Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote that year , " F'get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamie Peterman , the beauties who run Art Unltd. in Tillman Place . Jamie was married Sat . to Fibreboard 's Jack Davies . Wanda marries Papermate 's Matt Ashe April 23 . So slash your wrists ... " <p> " Jamie has an incredible aesthetic , pitch-perfect vision , " says Dawnine Dyer , the winemaker at Domaine Chandon for 25 years and now owner , with her husband , Bill , of Dyer Vineyard on Diamond Mountain . " She saw things so clearly , as real . She tracks what 's true very clearly . " <p> " Mom was always involved in the winemaking , " adds Hugh , " but she was the one who asked , ' What do we want the wine to taste like ? What is the vision for the product ? This is what we want it to taste like and feel like . ' She came from an aesthetic standpoint , in packaging , the look and feel of the place , the product ... she played a most significant role . <p> " More than anything , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebratory wine . She traveled from city to city , working with different chefs , the James Beard Foundation , the Culinary Institute of America , with Julia Child and others . When Mom and Dad started , there was n't a big food and wine connection in Napa Valley . " <p> The Davies helped create one . <p> They knew they 'd made it in 1972 , when President Richard Nixon took the 1969 Schramsberg Blanc de Blancs to the " Toast to Peace " dinner in China with Premier Chou En-lai . Davies says they were told to deliver the wine to a tarmac at Travis Air Force Base near Fairfield , which son Bill did , in a beat-up turquoise-colored pickup . They 'd heard that the wine might be headed for Beijing , but did n't know for sure . <p> Friend Ann Carpy called Jamie one morning and said , " Turn on your television , " Jamie recalls . " Barbara Walters is holding a bottle of Schramsberg on national TV ! " <p> Schramsberg paved the way for others trying to make Champagne-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first vintage , Domaine Chandon was built in Yountville , by Moet Hennessy , the first surfer on a wave of French-owned sparkling wine houses to hit California shores . Champagne Mumm , Louis Roederer and others would follow . <p> Today , Schramsberg wines are sold in 25 countries . Another mark of success came in June 2005 , when Hugh sold 28 cases of Schramsberg bubbly in Paris . To the French . To Champagne drinkers . <p> The widow Davies deserves much credit .
