Your spouse has been complaining about the minivan being hard to steer . Time to pick up a bottle of power steering oil on the way home . After you add the fluid , though , you notice a puddle of something under the engine . Within a minute of idling , the puddle is bigger by almost exactly 1 pint of power steering fluid . An odd coincidence , indeed . Checking the pump-which is buried well under the engine-reveals a lot of wet , oily stuff in the vicinity . Out come the ramps , and the minivan goes up in the air . If you 're lucky , you 'll just have to replace a cut rubber hose or kinked steel line . But if it 's not your day , you likely have a defective power steering pump . Red or oily stains in the driveway or garage-under an area where the transmission isn't-may also be a clue to a leak that 's slowly robbing your hydraulic assist . ( For more on diagnosing stains , see popu **27;5433;TOOLONG . ) Everybody Has One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , you 've never driven a vehicle made before , say , the ' ' 70s oil crisis . Except for a few late-model cars that use electrically powered steering racks , virtually all cars and trucks on the road today have power-assisted steering . The pump provides hydraulic boost to the steering gear ( the mechanism that actually pivots the front wheels ) to reduce the driver 's turning effort at the wheel . When this system is n't working properly , every parking maneuver can become an upper-body workout or an ear-piercing underhood concerto . ( We 'll get to the noise part in a minute . ) At road speeds , however , everything will seem pretty normal . Rolling front tires offer negligible resistance to turning , and the power steering system is under little load . At parkingmaneuver speed , you need substantial hydraulic boost to spin the steering wheel . What 's the Problem ? While the trouble may stem from any number of things , including the steering gear itself , it 's most likely an issue with the pump or a slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a hose or line has a leak so big that it 's reducing pressure to the steering gear , you would have known about it right away . You could have starred on the morning news as the guy who caused a 10-car pileup when the highpressure hose burst and dumped greasy fluid all over an interstate off ramp . No , you have a more subtle symptom . These belt-driven pumps normally wear out from a low fluid level ( caused by that slow leak ) , contaminated or improper fluid ( possibly caused by an overzealous service station jockey ) , or just age . A in Heat A power steering system that is in trouble often informs you of the problem by screaming for help , literally . Whenever the pump gets overloaded , it emits a high-pitched squeal that sounds something like a moose in heat . Rotate your steering wheel to its end stops for a demonstration . The noise is normal then . But if you hear that sound under any other condition , it means the pump is under load when it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pump is running dry . So check the power steering fluid level first . If the noise goes away after filling the reservoir to the proper level , you have a leak somewhere . The system wo n't lose fluid if it 's working properly . Squealing sounds ? As long as you 're under the vehicle , check the pump 's belt for proper tension as well as wear and tear . Many engines today use a single serpentine belt to drive all the accessories . If it fails , you 'll have more than just power steering trouble . So make sure the serpentine is riding the power steering pump 's pulley on the straight and narrow . Some pulleys are plastic , most metal . Regardless , eye it to be sure it 's running true . Replacing the Pump Power steering pumps are not a DIY rebuild item . A bad pump is replaced , usually with one that 's been professionally refurbished . You maybe charged a deposit , commonly called a core charge , when you pick up the new pump . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rebuild . Older cars ' systems were happy with generic automatic transmission fluid . These days , though , check your owner 's manual and the service literature for your specific vehicle at alldata diy.com to find out exactly what fluid your car or truck manufacturer recommends . Using the wrong fluid could mean doing the whole job over again in a few months . Where Is it ? The first step in replacing the pump is finding it . Do n't laugh . Its exact location under the hood depends on many factors . What kind of engine is it-inline or V ? Is the engine mounted transversely or longitudinally ? Is the fluid reservoir mounted remotely or is it integral with the pump ? The pump will be somewhere on the front of the engine with the other accessories . On the typical GM longitudinally mounted V8 , for example , the power steering pump will be right behind the radiator ( though not necessarily up high and within easy reach ) . The car seen here is a front-wheel-drive Chrysler-built minivan with a 3.3-liter V6 . Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should need only basic hand tools . However , some special flarenut wrenches and a special tool to safely remove the pulley from the pulley shaft will make the job easier . These usually can be rented-even borrowed-from the auto parts store that sells you the replacement pump . First , remove the drive belt(s) and take a close look-replace them if they 're damaged or oil-soaked . Undo the high- and low-pressure lines from the pump body ( and the reservoir hose if the fluid reservoir is mounted remotely ) . Have a catch pan handy for the fluid that will drip . As service manuals often say , " Reverse procedure to install replacement . " Of course , life in the real world is often nothing like life as described in a shop manual . For instance , on our minivan , the pump can be removed and installed only one way-from below . That 's because it 's mounted all the way at the bottom of the engine and up against the firewall . Wait , it gets worse . To get the pump out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move it aside . This is about as extreme as any power steering pump replacement can get , so yours will definitely be easier . After the new pump is in , belt reinstalled and tensioned , refill the system with the correct fluid . Then-preferably with the front wheels just off the ground and with the engine idling-rotate the steering wheel from left stop to right stop a dozen times to burp excess air from the system . Recheck the fluid level in a couple of days . Final step : Join a health club or gym to stay in shape because your car 's power steering will no longer be your mobile Bowflex machine .
