Where did the time god Seems like just yesterday we published Rod Garcia 's " A Princess of Helium , " and yet the records show that story appeared in our September 1998 issue . Time flies ... as do many other things in the wild space adventure Mr. Garcia depicts here . Do n't worry if you missed that last story-you need n't have read it in order to follow this one . just dive right in and enjoy . <p> The brain is not an organ of thinking , but an organ of survival like fang and claw . It is made in such a way that we accept as truth that which is merely advantage . - Albert von Szent-Gyorgyi Nobel Prize Winner in Physiology 1937 Pawn Opening NEAR TO NOON , DEFOE 'S Moropus gave out beneath him , pitching him face first into hat red sand . He came up spitting grit , staring at the big dead retrobred beast - half-horse , half-rhino , with thick hide and clawed feet . The things looked indestructible . Dumb , mean , and ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden to death . He struggled to his feet , resisting the temptation to collapse next to his dead mount . Sweat poured out of him , and his still-suit whined in protest . If Ariel 's pull were not a relaxed .5 g , he would never have gotten up . Bare existence had become a grueling struggle Defoe was bound to lose . He had ridden for hours under a searing noontime sun , long enough to kill his Moropus . This far into Dayside , the red sun Prospero looped around a point just short of the zenith - making it always near to noon . Never dawn or dusk . Defoe glanced back at his pursuers . Dots on the shimmering red desertscape , two dozen of them , growing larger as he watched . Defoe did not need his macroscope to know what they were . SuperChimps , Pan troglodyte supreme , mounted on Moropuses . Just like he had been . Normally you had nothing much to fear from Chimps - except that they might drop your baggage , or overcook the eggs - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless Defoe did something quick and ingenious , he would end up as dead as his Moropus . As dead as the crew at Subsolar Station . Stripping water and emergency rations off his pack saddle , Defoe strapped his medikit to his arm and started running . Setting his adhesive boots on REPEL , he fairly flew in the light gravity , aiming for a pile of pink boulders rising out of the plain ahead . A surprising number of life 's mishaps could be solved by sheer blind panic , running so fast and so far that the problem got lost , or discouraged . This did not look like one of those times . But win or lose , it never hurt to put distance between you and your troubles . Glancing over his shoulder , Defoe saw the Chimps gaining . He redoubled his effort - spurred by the horror he had seen at Subsolar Station . Rampaging SuperChimps had beat the crew to death with coolant pipe , torque wrenches , and other odd bits of station equipment . The station crew had not been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinionated Humanists , boastful and intolerant but they did not deserve to be beaten to death by a bunch of over-evolved chimpanzees . Not much anyway . And Defoe himself had been a total bystander , peaceably delivering a cargo to Subsolar Station . Then , wham , all hell broke loose . Had he not hopped a spare Moropus , he would have been as dead as his hosts . Despite the light gravity , and the kick of his boots , he felt his body slowing . Lungs labored in the kiln-like air . Thighs ached from hours of riding . Total collapse loomed . He told his medikit to take away the pain , pushing his body to its chemically enhanced limit . Defoe did not carry a gun , or any sort of weapon . He was a pilot for Priscilla 's sake . A noncombatant , with a rare and valuable skill . Ideally a pilot should be sacrosanct and untouchable . A sort of flying nun . But here-and-now nobody played by the rules . Least of all these monkeys run amok . Hitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRIP , running straight up the rocks . Porous stone absorbed the slap of his boots , making the sprawling volcanic rockpile soundless as a cemetery . Bounding from boulder to boulder , he sprinted for the high silent heart of the pile . Overgrown monkeys on Moropuses could never match his speed over broken ground . But they did not have to . The boulders did not go on forever . This jumble of pinkish lava and rusty cinder block stopped at the plateau edge . There cliffs plunged downward , disappearing into the cloud plain covering Ariel 's super-heated surface . Ninety percent of Ariel remained absolutely uninhabitable , smothered by thick untamed atmosphere . Ruthless terraforming had created a rudimentary biosphere based on high plateaus and mountaintops . Lower elevations were still a seething cauldron of burning winds and greenhouse gases . The Subsolar Plateau was the largest habitable feature on the planet , a huge tidal bulge thrust up into the biosphere . Unfortunately Defoe had come to the end of it . Headlong flight could not take him much farther . Chest heaving , he flopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he broadcast a mental call for help - his first MAYDAY signal since the Moropus collapsed . He got no answer . Medusa and Cape Colony - the high-boast starships that had brought him to Ariel - were on polar orbits , low over the Twilight Belt . Well below the horizon at this longitude . And the transceiver in his head was limited to line-of-sight . His cerebral microchip did not have the watts to bounce a signal off Ariel 's high patchy ionosphere ; not with Prospero straight overhead . Normally the planetary Comnet would boost his signal to a beanstalk station , putting him in instant touch with anyone in the system . But the Comnet had crashed at the same time the Chimps went crazy - something too convenient to be coincidence . Closing his eyes , he scanned the available channels , starting with the closest - his pursuers . The Chimps all wore mini-cam headbands , standard station equipment in case they got lost or strayed . None of them had discarded their headbands , or even bothered turning them off . Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defoe got a choice of two dozen Chimp's-eye views of the chase-which might be an advantage when they got closer . Right now he saw boiling dust , broken by the rear ends of the lead Moropuses , each topped by the back and butt of an angry SuperChimp . Neither helpful nor encouraging . A few klicks above and behind him , he picked up an open channel , a pair of bird herders , winged shepherds with a tame roc to carry their gear . Defoe punched a call through . No reply . He tried Universal , pidgin Old Speak , even plain English ; but these bird herders were not buying . Their communicators might be turned down . More likely neither felt like answering . A lot of locals did not respond to offplanet accents - ignoring calls for help , attempts at conversation , even Settlers standing a couple of centimeters in front of them shouting in their faces . If you do n't like having us around - pretend we are not here . Farther out he contacted a semi-rigid , a moronic robo-freighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con the airship into dropping ballast and rushing to his aid-but the simple-minded control circuitry refused to even boost his signal . Beyond the airship lay nothing . just the Great Reach . Thousands of klicks of empty air and burning waste , stretching out over the horizon toward Freeport , Aloha , and other islands of habitation in the Twilight Belt . And orbiting above that Belt was the ship Defoe had come in , the AMC Medusa - an armed merchant cruiser stocked with enough antimatter warheads and orbit-to-surface missiles to depopulate the planet . Tantalizingly out of reach . He shifted back to the Chimps , finding them frighteningly close . A couple had reined in to inspect his dead Moropus , while the rest dismounted and fanned out to surround the rockpile . Just being Chimps did not make them stupid . Or pushovers . Not for the first time Defoe questioned the wisdom of mixing human and chimpanzee DNA sympathizing with the Humanists who wanted the biological clock turned back , sterilizing all " bioengineered beings " and post-Atomic species . Being clubbed to death by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution had taken a wrong turn . Suddenly , in a burst of static , the Comnet sprang back on . Salvation . Defoe barely believed it . One moment he was lying clinging to a rock watching death draw closer and moaning over man 's fate- a nanosecond later he was plugged back into the cosmos . Finally able to phone home . Appropriately Defoe recognized a religious channel . Figures they would be first on line . Always pushing the message . Open your heart to the King . Elvis Saves . The entrance logo was a stylized cloud-draped mansion in the sky , with shady oaks and white pine pillars . GRACELAND was welded to the wrought iron gate . Defoe wafted in . Towering stained glass windows showed scenes from Wild in the Country , Blue Hawaii , and Girl Happy . Music welled up . Right on cue , the King himself strutted down a wide white staircase , a guitar slung on his hip - each step timed to the beat of " Blue Suede Shoes . " Spots played over him , backed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports arena filled with 50,000 screaming faithful . At the foot of the stairs he did a one-handed flourish , finishing with a judo chop . Music stopped . Cheering ceased . Elvis struck a pose , a sly mocking smile on his full lips . Dark tousled hair fell onto his broad forehead , " Welcome to Graceland . Let the King be with you . " All this was wasted on Defoe , who was n't a Believer . Or even a fan . He did not need spiritual comfort from a deified rock star . " Clear the channel . This is a MAYDAY . " Defoe bore down on the last word . Elvis 's virtual smile widened . He gave his head a sorry shake , " Do n't worry , son . We 'll get you out of this . Believe me , the King 's seen worse . Lots worse . " " Damn you , clear the channel . " Religious messages were supposed to give way to emergency signals - even on Ariel . But the King refused to fade . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His smile turned wry , " Not that dyin 's so bad . We all die someday . I did . Though millions would not believe it . But hey , you do n't see me cryin ' . " He hit the guitar , strumming a couple of bars of " Heartbreak Hotel . " " Death 's the great adventure , " Elvis declared . " And it 's done me fine . You just do n't look ready for it . " Defoe could not believe it . Trapped in a virtual sermon , with no sign that his ersatz Elvis meant to clear the channel . " Get lost , " he shouted aloud . " No way . " Elvis laughed . " The King ai n't leaving you . Not in a fix like this . You got a bunch of bad-ass Chimps breathing down yer neck . " Defoe flashed back to the bad-ass Chimps , who were working their way into the rocks . Time to move . Not wanting to be caught in a 3V trance - communing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swig of water , and shifted to his right . Keeping his head down . Thanks to the mini-cams he could see the Chimps without them seeing him . His best hope was to work his way around them and steal another Moropus . There were two dozen of them - and only one of him - but he could tune in on them whenever he wanted without their knowing it . Clearly the Chimps did not realize he could see through their headcams . ( Otherwise they would have turned them off. / Smart ? Maybe - but still Chimps . Damned smart Chimps as it turned out . Instead of looking in every nook and bolt hole , they threw a wide net around three sides of the rockpile , quickly working their way inward . If he had been hiding at the edge of the pile , he might have gotten through a gap between the Chimps . But it would have done him no good . The pair checking out his mount came up to stand guard over the Moropuses . Either Chimp outmassed him more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were mounted on huge rhino-hided claw-footed monsters . Not the odds he liked . " Give em Hell , boy . " Elvis materialized just behind his right shoulder - dressed in a white high-collared jacket over wide bell bottoms with a gold belt sporting a big thunderbird buckle . He wore tinted shades in the noontide glare . " Too bad you do n't know karate . " Too bad . The King 's hovering presence came from a3V signal beamed to his auditory cortex and the peripheral area of his left optical lobe . Defoe tried to block it , but megarams of memory backed the channel , boosting the signal , dodging his defenses , tearing through encryption . If Defoe wanted privacy he had to shut down his transceiver , then purge the system bit by bit . He needed his virtual senses far too much for that . " Did you know I 'm a black belt ? " Elvis whirled around , coming out of the spin in a black karate gi , knees bent , hands flat and casually extended . " Ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . He 'd hit like a holo . No Chimp could even see the King . Their headcams were to let humans look in on them - not to entertain the wearer . Right now they showed the Chimps moving more slowly , back in visual contact with each other . Now they were looking in every nook and cranny . They had guessed - correctly - that Defoe would be hiding in the highest part of the pile , where it backed against the plateau edge . " There 's only one way to go , " Elvis nodded at a tall pinnacle overlook . ing the cloud-filled drop behind him . Not a chance , thought Defoe . The mere idea of fighting with that drop at his back made him queasy . The Chimps gave him no choice . Through the headcams he saw them close in , slowly and methodically . Flankers reached the rim on either side , cutting off his last slim hope of escape . The rest combed forward , searching as they came . Unimaginative but efficient . The plodding end game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed where he was , he would be overwhelmed . Retreating to the pinnacle at least forced them to come at him one two-hundred kilo SuperChimp at a time . Defoe broke cover , skipping over boulders in his sticky boots . His virtual companion stayed with him . " Nervous , are n't you ? " He did not bother to answer . Nervous ? No way . Scared witless was the correct term . Shaking with exhaustion after hours in the saddle . So wobbly on his feet it took powered boots to keep him upright . " Nervousness is natural , " Elvis assured him . " I used to get totally torqued before a performance . So torqued I could hardly talk . I 'd be standing in the wings at the Vegas Hilton , heart pounding a mile a minute , shaking like a wet dog . But I always did fine . Know why ? " Leaping from rock to rock , Defoe did not know and cared less . He scrambled out onto the pinnacle , a thin point of stone poking out over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-assed show . I had to go out there and be the absolute best . King of Rock and Roll . That 's the secret . Give it everything , and you 'll do great . " The rockpile ended . Empty space yawned at Defoe 's feet . Telling his boots to brake , he tottered to a stop atop the pinnacle , surrounded on three sides by a sheer drop into boiling cloud cover . Kilometers beneath him lay Ariel 's incandescent surface . Even in a still-suit the surface heat would broil him beyond recognition - assuming he was unlucky enough to survive the fall . He turned about to check on the Chimps . Three of them picked their way along the rim toward him . Four more emerged from the rocks , followed by a fifth . With his adhesive boots he could head down the cliff face , but to where ? The surface was uninhabitable , and the Chimps would rain rocks down until they knocked him off . Elvis stood next to him , feet set in empty air , still wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready ? " Defoe shot him a dirty look . Chimps clustered at the knife-edge leading to the pinnacle , pointing and pant-hooting . Several picked up stones , jagged igneous missiles that would zip like cannon shells in one half gravity . " I mean really ready ? " Elvis 's eyes were alight . His voice had that easy drawl , part of his cool persona , like his smile . But his eyes were tuned to his body language , piercing and driven . Ignoring his virtual tormentor , Defoe told his boots to grip , wondering how in the hell he would dodge the rocks . The Chimps might be bigger and stronger , but they were barefoot . If he could just make them come at him , he could pitch them off as they came on one at a time . All two dozen of them . What a hoot . " ' Cause now 's the time . " Elvis raised his right hand , circling his index finger over his head as though cueing the music . " Here 's your honky tonk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush of wings . He looked up . A fresh-faced young woman swept past on silver wings . Long red hair streamed behind her from beneath a jaunty green cap . Defoe recognized one of the bird herders who had ignored his calls for help . She wore a green bolero jacket over a gold and black harlequin flight suit . Her wings were eight-meter power-assisted Falcoform Condors , with black solar strips on the upper surfaces . And the roc was with her . The huge condor-like bird landed atop the pinnacle alongside him . She was an outsized female , colored slate green , with a twenty-meter wingspan , an enlarged braincase , and a tall aquiline beak . Best of all , her pack saddle was empty . The giant bird bent down , bringing her saddle closer to the ground . Elvis grinned with delight . Lowering his finger , he pointed straight at Defoe , " Gotcha ! " He disappeared . Astonished , Defoe stood there , boots stuck to the stone . The young bird herder banked and turned back toward him , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal ID number tattooed to her left cheek ; the sort used by Settlers to mark a convict serving a long sentence . Or slated for lethal injection . Telling his boots to let go , Defoe scrambled onto the roc 's saddle , seizing the head-bar . The roc took off , accompanied by the red-headed honky tonk angel with a felon 's tattoo . SuperChimps were left staring up into space , hooting to each other as Defoe dwindled overhead . SWEATING WITH RELIEF inside his still-suit , Defoe just wished he were aboard something more stable . Rocs began as brainy , over-sized condors , bred on Old Earth to compensate for species lost in the late preAtomic extinctions . On light gravity worlds like Beta Hydri IV , they evolved into the huge man-carrying flying mare beneath him . A bioengineered wonder . But Defoe was a pilot - instantly obeyed by space craft , hovercars , and whatnot . He hated clinging to a pack saddle , unable to give commands . Or even ask questions . Winging over the cloud plain - headed who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living being between him and a long fall . He tried to quiz the redhead in charge , but she refused to answer , flying silently ahead of him . Her pennant of scarlet hair streamed back from beneath her green visor-cap . Defoe told his augmented memory to conjure up her face . Instantly she hovered before him in 3V , just as he had first seen her . Grass green eyes full of innocent determination framed a stub nose above wide soft lips . Which made the numbers on her cheek really stand out . Defoe recognized conviction codes for impossibly serious offenses . Murder . Armed terrorism . Sabotage . Willful defacement of property . A short synopsis of the penal code stenciled across her cheek . Ridiculous . A prank . Like a pin through the nose . A convict 's tattoo to shock the old folks . Yet she did not seem the type . Grave honesty lurked in her alert gaze . She already looked a shade older than she should have . Whatever the answer to her riddle , she was not giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telling the image to fade , Defoe closed his eyes . Hours aboard the Moropus had his body screaming for rest . Clipping himself to the pack saddle , he drifted off , letting the roc 's swaying beat rock him to sleep . He dreamed of Graceland . Defoe recognized the lead-in to the religious channel . Once again he wafted through the wrought iron music gate into the cloud-draped mansion . But this time there was no Elvis . Priscilla Queen of Heaven waited for him on the white stairs . He recognized the flowing brown hair and keen expressive eyes that adorned halos and icons throughout Human Space . How could a pilot not know Saint Priscilla . Her father , Colonel Beaulieu , was the patron saint of Defoe 's profession . Her Betrothal , Wedding , and Daughter 's Name Day  --  December 25 , May 1 , and February 2 - were all interstellar holidays . Besides , this was Graceland . Who else could she be ? She did not look enough like Elvis to be Mother Gladys or Lisa-Marie . Flanking her were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-bodyguard Dave and preacher Rick . Dave wore a white karate gi , and had searching " head hunter " eyes , accustomed to spotting trouble in a crowd of admirers . Rick had longer hair , a wide smile , and wore a preacher 's shining " suit-of-lights . " Priscilla smiled , speaking English with the firm confidence of Elvis 's destined mate , a woman picked for greatness . " You will go to Shangtu . " " To Shangtu ? " It was a greenie port halfway around the plateau . " Yes , Shangtu . " Priscilla had the patience of a goddess . " When you get there , go to the House of Ro Dae Ho . " " The House of who ? " It was unfair of them to come at him in his sleep . Defoe replayed the words in his head . In Old Speak it sounded like " House of Rodeo . " " The house of Ro Dae Ho , " Preacher Rick repeated , drawing out the syllables . " Folks there call him Uncle Ho . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay slumped on the back of a strange roc , headed where the bird willed . What gives here ? Why Shangtu ? Why Ro Dae Ho ? Why him for that matter ? Rick chuckled at his confusion , " Do n't worry , you 'll get there . " " Safely . " Priscilla added . Good news there . Defoe opened his eyes , blinking in harsh Prospero light . Graceland had vanished . During his chat with Saint Priscilla , the roc had rejoined the bird herder 's flock . Defoe found himself surrounded by big banded geese in a staggered V formation , skimming along the edge of the plateau , riding updrafts off the superheated surface . Ahead of the flock flew a Bat-boy , a meter long semi-human with leathery wings stretched between long-fingered arms and stunted legs . Half-gliding , half-swimming , the undersized grotesque used big wholebody strokes to power himself through the air . Pointed ears , an impish face , and a short tail attached to the interfemoral membrane made him one of those overly engineered beings the Settlers despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunward , hoping for a goose dinner . Each time the bird herders turned them back . Farther along , a Wyvyrn rose out of the clouds along the cliff face - a segmented omnivore bigger than a flock of rocs and twice as menacing . More flying megafauna from Beta Hydri IV . The Wyvyrn paralleled them , making no move to close . Even a hundred meter multi-winged monster armed with hideous fanged mandibles was wary of humans . Or quasi-humans . Genus Homo was easily the most dangerous and adaptable lifeform for a thousand light-years in any direction . Able to devastate whole planets when the need arose . The bird herders brought their flock down on a flat green volcanic mesa dotted by mossy rain pools choked with sedges . Piles of goose droppings marked a familiar feeding ground . Dismounting from the roc , Defoe looked for someplace to sit not slick with goose shit . Finding a fairly clean spot at the cliff edge , he sat and stared down at the cloud forest clinging to the flanks of the mesa . Kilometer-tall trees topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Wyvyrn circled at a respectful distance . Shedding her wings , the young woman settled in beside him , saying in English , " Sorry for not answering your calls . " She ran a thumb along the numbers on her cheek , " There 's a price on my head . " Literally . " In fact , it would do me good if you could keep off the air . " She said it plainly and simply , putting her freedom in his hands , asking him to keep communications silence . Making Defoe feel like an oaf . " Of course . I 'm sorry . I should have known ... " He had a lot to learn about criminal conspiracy - which is what this was fast becoming . " Thanks . " She held out her hand . " The name 's Llenor . " " Defoe . Dan Defoe . " They shook . Her grip felt firm and real , lingering a shade longer than needed . He thanked her for picking him up . " Do n't mention it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean that . If anyone asks , you never so much as heard of me . " Defoe nodded . " lowe you that . " Under Settler Law he would be aiding and abetting , but like any sensible vacuum hand he steered clear of arguments among Dirtsiders . Llenor let go of his hand . His palm tingled , thrilled by the contact . " Why did you come for me ? " he asked . Her grin widened . " Someone up there likes you : " Right , leave it to the King . Llenor looked like a Believer , absurdly naive and ready to do right . Too bad . She seemed so sane otherwise . But why all the heavenly interest in him ? Defoe could not think of any good deeds he had done of late . Llenor studied him intently , perhaps wondering what Elvis had gotten her into . " How did you get hung out like that ? " Defoe told his tragic story , such as it was . His trip to Subsolar Station . The Comnet crash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Llenor showed genuine concern . Cocking her head every so often , to listen to inner voices . Or incoming calls . When he was done , all she said was , " You 're a pilot ? So am L " She sounded pleased . " Really ? " " Atmosphere work only , " Llenor admitted wistfully . " I 've never been outsystem , or even offplanet . " And most likely she never would . Beyond the wild fringes of the Subsolar Plateau she was a marked young woman , liable to be arrested or shot on sight . " Did you think I herded birds fox a living ? " Digits on her face said she was a saboteur and kidnapper , but Defoe refrained from pointing that out . He switched the subject instead . " Any idea what made those Chimps go crazy ? " She shrugged , " Maybe it 's the way Settlers treat them . " " What do you mean ? " " You know . Sterilizing them . Caging and dissecting them . Gassing them when they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like animals ? " " Exactly . " " But they always put up with it before . " She shot him a quizzical look , " You expect them to tell you ahead of time ? Like present a petition ? They 're Chimps , remember ? " Right . Chimps were animals . You were not allowed to mistreat them , not in public anyway . But under Settler Law killing one could not be called murder . If it was your Chimp-and you did it humanely-you would get off without even a fine . " I suppose you treat your Chimps differently . " Llenor gave a don't-make-me-puke grimace . " We do n't own each other . That 's what separates us from the Bugs . " Bugs , aka " Sculptorian Symbiots , " were generally held to be the lowest form of intelligent life . She shook her head . " When Elvis was a boy , back in the pre-Atomic , white people used to buy and sell black people . " Llenor said it softly , as if she were ashamed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisa-Marie married Saint Michael , bringing love between the races . " Let 's hear it for Lisa-Marie . And Saint Michael . Defoe stared at her . Llenor had that guileless , Outback idiocy by the bucket , believing in Elvis and Priscilla , and Mother Gladys . She was probably a sucker for fair play , and giving everyone a break . No wonder Settlers wanted her dead . The big surprise was that none of the sentences stenciled on her cheek had been carried out - yet . " So what 's next ? " he wondered . " I 'm taking you to Shangtu . " She said it as if she did not like their destination . Shangtu was not a settlement , but well within reach of Settler Law . She was putting herself in real peril , just for some offplanet stranger . " You do n't sound happy to be headed there . " Llenor laughed , " Would you be , if you were me ? " " Then why are you doing it ? " There were safer ways of seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King wants . " Right . What Elvis wants , Elvis gets . Clearly Llenor was not the type to be talked out of doing right . Defoe did not even try . If she meant to risk her life for religion , that was her mistake . As soon as he got to Shangtu , he would punch a call through to Medusa and arrange a pickup . Llenor would have to look out for herself . Which was too bad , since he hated taking advantage of women , children , and pious innocents . Feeling a touch guilty , he told her , " Thanks . I owe you a lot . " He meant it . Even if Llenor left him sitting alone on this goose-shit mesa he would be deep in her debt . She looked him over , then shrugged . " No sweat . You seem like the sort worth having around . " The way she said it sounded a warning . Llenor was not really so blase about this . Not as nonchalant as she tried to look . Defoe put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a total stranger . All on Elvis 's say-so . Another pair of Bat-boys arrived . He could see what upset the Settlers . The stunted misshapen creatures with wings , tails , and furry faces could hardly be mistaken for human . And could never lead " normal " lives . Otherwise they Looked happy , greeting each other by cracking jokes in Old Speak . Their thin flexible wing-skin formed the perfect flying organ , and a thumb and two extra fingers on their wing hands let them pick things up and preen each other . Creating them may have been a crime , but they might not see it that way . Hell , they might even enjoy life . Seemingly discouraged at seeing more semi-humans , the Wyvyrn spiraled back into the cloud forest in a single swirling movement , disappearing like water down a drain . Llenor turned the goose herd over to the Bat-boys , then nodded toward the roc . " Let 's get going . " Defoe mounted up and they headed out , letting the green mesa dwindle behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted a gleaming spark on a converging course . Incoming signals IDed it as the robo-freighter he had tried to relay through . Distance narrowed , and Defoe realized why his earlier relay had been a bust . Instead of a dowdy semi-rigid he saw a quarter-kilometer long fusion powered airship , with twin falcon figureheads . Tall English lettering on the silver lifting body hull identified the Princess Lisa-Marie . Llenor gave a landing sign , and the hangar doors swung open . The roc flew in and alighted . Defoe leaped down , delighted to have a deck beneath his boots . Feeling almost home . Llenor landed behind him . Drawn up on the hangar deck was the weirdest excuse for a crew he had ever seen . Half-filling the hangar was the Wyvyrn he had met earlier - or one just like it-curled up with its wings folded back along its body , its head segment raised to face the hangar door . Something about a Wyvyrn 's big , fanged mandibles made them always seem to be smiling , like a Chinese dragon silently laughing at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SuperChimps in rigger 's harnesses , leading the roc to a perch , seeing it was fed . Overseeing the whole show was a small blonde woman with an angelic smile , wearing a powder-blue uniform and a big machine pistol strapped to her hip . A Valkyrie so beautiful she made Llenor look like a boy . Defoe shook his head in wonder . Welcome aboard the Princess LisaMarie . It looked to be one wild flight . Llenor did the introductions . The Wyvyrn was the ship 's flight officer . The closest thing it had to a name was a single unpronounceable syllable - " Qiip . " No one bothered to name the Chimps , since they did not belong to anyone , and never had trouble telling each other apart . But the Thal bossing them was the ship 's bosun , " Wha-tsoph-ki . " " And this is Amanda . " Llenor indicated the dazzling blonde Valkyrie with the machine pistol . " She 's chief of onboard security , and can show you to a cabin . Get some rest , " Llenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least through the noon watch . " Clearly she had a captain 's itch to get back to piloting . Defoe found it fairly painless to be in Amanda 's care - like having a Feelie star show him to his cabin . Flat black slidewalks swept them down art deco corridors shining like chrome mirrors . Amanda apologized for the lack of amenities . " There 's no steward . Princess Lisa-Marie 's a working ship , not a five-star liner . So do n't ask the Chimps for service-they wo n't know what you are talking about . " " My last berth was on a warship , " Defoe admitted . The Medusa did not have steward service either . Amanda nodded , " Should be right at home . " Once he was alone in his cabin , Defoe struggled out of his still-suit and sweat-soaked body stocking . Stuffing the body stocking into the laundry slot , he got back a pair of ship 's coveralls . Flopping down on the futon , he told the galley to fix dinner . Ariel did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning watch , he got served a heaping breakfast ; soy and eggs , with yeast strips , high-fiber toast , honey grits and pancakes smothered in fruit puree . Defoe topped it off with a relaxing shower and a sound sleep . Whatever came next , it would be far better to face it fed , clean , and rested . This time he got no call to Graceland . " Good morning . " Someone giggled , in stereo . " No , silly , it 's good afternoon . " Opening his eyes , Defoe instantly thought he was hallucinating : Or at least seeing double . Standing in the open hatchway to his cabin was a broad shouldered , buxom young woman with two bottle-blonde heads . " Hi , " said the left head . " My name is Norma . " " And I 'm Jean , " added the other . " But you can call us Marilyn . " They said the last bit in unison , obviously a practiced line . He sat up on his futon , trying to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual number of arms , legs , etc . They  --  she had on tight blue pants and a shapeless black top a size or so too small . " My name 's Defoe . " That much he was sure of . They laughed together . " We know . " " We heard there was a man aboard ... " " ... and had to come see . " " It 's an honor . " " Exciting . " Norma seemed to speak first . With Jean adding something , or finishing the sentence . Glad he never trusted cabin locks , Defoe swung his feet off the futon , and started pulling on his boots . He was already wearing the ship 's coveralls . Checking his internal chronometer , he found it was nearly thirteen o'clock , well into the noon watch . " There are no men on the ships " " Not really . " " Unless you count Thals . " " Or Chimps . " " Or Lucifer . " " Come , we 'll show you . " He stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keel slidewalk , happy to have him in tow . Charmingly barefoot , Norma and Jean timed everything perfectly , walking , talking , and swinging their hips together . No mean feat , since each head controlled a different side of their body . Norma gave brisk orders to hatches and slidewalks , while Jean flirted with him over her shoulder . The forebridge was a Humanist nightmare . Everyone was human , more or less - no SuperChimps or retrobred Neanderthals . But nearly everyone was cloned in some whimsical fashion . Llenor had an identical younger sister with her , named Evie . Both turned out to be clones of their maternal grandmother . And she also had twin cousins , Lilith and Lucifer - female and male copies of their mother . Norms and Jean fit right in , making Defoe feel more than ever the odd man out . But Princess Lisa-Marie was still a ship . Lilith and Lucifer were watch officers . Marilyn turned out to be training as a comtech . Little sister Evie was the cabin girl . And Llenor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her family around her , seeing the air ahead , telling Lisa-Marie what to do . Not being the type to fly from his cabin , Defoe liked watching her work . Hitting a sharp temperature inversion , she lost her superheat and had to tilt her turbofans for the vertical thrust to ride over it . Seeing her at the helm reminded him of how long it had been since he 'd conned his own ship . Plying a shuttle from surface to orbit was not near the same thing . " Did you sleep ? " she asked . " Famously . " He tilted his head toward Marilyn , having a four.way talk with the Twins . " Until ... " Llenor laughed , " Marilyn can be a shock first thing in the afternoon . But she 's super on long watches . Wo n't let anyone sleep . Two heads , two hearts , and one body keeps you on your toes . " And a double set of hormones . " She got me out of bed , " Defoe admitted . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Freeport brothel . Lisa-Marie tends to collect misfits . " Like me , Defoe thought . Clearly Llenor was always doing Elvis 's work . How could she not ? He asked what she was carrying , besides misfits . " Offworld robotics , and smuggled pharmaceuticals . Too hot and pricy for Shangtu . We 'll have to move them further along the plateau . " She stayed justifiably vague about future plans . What Defoe did not know could not incriminate him . Flying over rolling cloud plain , they talked the watch away . Intensely curious about the greater cosmos , Llenor loved his offworld stories . He could feel her eager sense of wonder , confined by the need to live in hiding on her birth-planet . And it was plain she liked him , hanging on his stories , laughing at his jokes , inviting him to be less of a stranger . From time to time she would stop to tune in on telemetry , or inner voices . Defoe watched her out of the comer of his eye , " taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . Making command decisions . Receiving scrambled 3V messages , but never sending . Far from feeling slighted , Defoe liked that serious side of her . He too was a pilot , trained to set things aside - even important things - to see a job done right . When the watch was over , she treated him to a ship 's tour that took up both dog watches . By the time they were done , Defoe felt like " captain 's pet . " A cushy billet for someone whose life depended on Llenor 's good intentions . Only later , lying in his cabin , did Defoe have second thoughts . What he was getting into with this earnest young Believer ? He liked Llenor . Who would n't ? She was honest and generous . Intensely fair , and not too demanding . But what future could there be between an itinerant space pilot and an outlawed clone caught in some doomed struggle with the planetary authorities ? Not much . Best he ignore any budding feelings and just get to Shangtu . His misgivings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning watch Amanda appeared at his door . She had not said a word to Defoe since showing him to his cabin . Not surprising . Scuttlebutt had it that the silent blonde security officer was " same sex oriented . " Clearly Defoe did not interest Amanda , so long as he behaved himself . Which he apparently was not doing . The security officer sat him down on his futon , saying , " I have something to tell you . " " What 's that ? " Defoe could not help liking Amanda - and not just because she was knock-dead gorgeous . They had two big things in common . They both preferred women-always a good starting point . And Amanda was the only other unreconstructed human aboard . Everybody else was some sort of bioconstruct . A clone . A Chimp . A Thai , or worse . That she was a gun-toting lesbian did not seem a serious difference hundreds of light-years from home . " Do n't do anything to hurt her . " " Hurt who ? " Defoe was being ridiculously inoffensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the Captain 's . " Llenor . She likes you . Heaven knows why . " " Okay . I 'll try . " Defoe did not mean to hurt anyone , least of all Lienor . " You better do more than try . " Amanda said it with a smile , sitting on his futon , her pistol safely bolstered - but her warning came through in the clear . Scuttlebutt also had it that the security officer was an ex-merc on permanent AWOL , who bad killed more men than a slew of bad landings , and was charged with numerous serious offenses . A ship run by women barely needed an intercom - Marilyn alone could be a font of information . Defoe ventured that Llenor seemed well able to care of herself , being smart and competent with a quarter-kilometer of airship at her command . Amanda shook her head , " Looks are deceiving . " " Really ? " " Take those tattoos on her face . They do n't mean shit . " Defoe said they seemed fairly serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Talked to her . Do you think she 's a killer ? A terrorist ? " " No . " Defoe had never seen a less likely suspect . " She 's innocent as they come . " Defoe had seen enough Settler Law to believe that they routinely got the wrong person . " Is that why the sentences were n't carried out ? " " They were n't carried out because I went to a deal of trouble to spring her from the Port Myrine brig . Understand ? " " Sort of . " Defoe began wondering if he had landed in the midst of some " thing " between the Lisa-Marie 's Captain and security officer . Amanda coolly read his thoughts . " I 'm not in love with her . Not the way you are thinking . Llenor is special . Sure , she 's the Captain . But we all look out for her . I do . The Twins do . Everyone does , right down to Evie and the Chimps . Why do you think Marilyn came to check you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he thought he had been such a hit , turning two heads at once . " I guess I understand . " " Do you really ? I doubt it . Llenor was framed for a bombing at the Helium Works Bugville below Port Myrine . Xenophobes killed a couple of Hive Queens , a whole bunch of Bugs , and a woman pulling security . Does that sound like her ? " Defoe shook his head . Xenophobes were Humanist fanatics , hating anything more than two shades different . Llenor hardly fit the description , being a bioconstruct herself . One who surrounded herself with outcasts and treated Chimps like they had rights . But common sense arguments were rigorously excluded under Settler Law . Amanda 's look turned colder . " The woman she supposedly killed was my lover , Kia . Do you think I 'd turn outlaw for Llenor , setting her free and watching over her , if there were the slightest doubt of her innocence ? " Defoe nodded . Amanda acted dead serious about the law - more so than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her own hands . " I see your point . " " It gets worse . The last guy she fell for was the jerk who set her up . " " That 's terrible . " Defoe really meant it . " Especially for him . He got fried . " " Oh . " " Do n't make me kill you too , " Amanda advised . Defoe swore he would do his best . Suddenly he was godawful anxious to get to Shangtu . And not because Amanda might be forced to fry him . Llenor was the one who worried him . Hearing her story had him caring for her - more than was healthy . Unless something soon separated them , things could swiftly get out of hand . But by the noon watch they were back together , this time on the upper deck , watching the plateau edge slide by to starboard . Clouds piled up by prevailing winds filled the gullies in the cliff face . Sitting alongside Llenor , with nothing to do but enjoy the cloudscape , was like visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them . Without worries or cares . A world not at all like Ariel , but having many of the same elements - the plateau , the cloud plain , the Lisa-Marie , and the two of them . A world with no past , and definitely no future . Llenor looked at him . Her long red hair danced in the slipstream , strands flying in front of her freckled face . " What 's got you worried ? " Defoe nodded . " I 'm not sure I should be doing this . " She smiled , " It 's a free planet . " Llenor sounded fully aware of the irony . Ariel was free only by default , a raw chaotic wilderness , marginally terraformed , mostly lawless , and utterly untamed . But Defoe heard a hint of challenge in her voice . She believed her home planet was free , for those willing to make it so . He knew now why she never talked about home or the numbers on her cheek - sensing her deep hurt and homesickness . Sister Evie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twilight Belt . No father of course . But a mother , plus aunts and cousins they could never be with - not even for virtual visits . The best scrambled signals could still be traced . That did not stop Llenor from asking about his past . She craved personal information - as if compiling a file for after he was gone . Where had he been ? Where was he born ? " On Old Earth , " he told her . A long , long time ago . " Like Elvis ? " Defoe laughed , " Just like Elvis . " Llenor laughed too . An obvious absurdity . No one could be just like Elvis . She took her religion seriously - but laughing was allowed . A big part of the Elvis gospel was , " Ya got ta have fun . " An electronic religion based on romantic unreality and hedonistic intimacy . She reached out . " I 've never touched anyone from Old Earth before . " Their hands touched , just fingers at first , then palm to palm . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting go . Neither acknowledging that they were holding hands . Llenor had no intention of bringing the Princess Lisa-Marie any closer to Shangtu . Too much traffic went in and out of the port , making it impossible to maintain their robo-freighter disguise . Instead she planned a low-profile approach on roc-back from the plateau side . Defoe wanted it even more low-profile . " Just drop me on the plateau edge . Once you are clear I can call for help . " Hell , he could always walk to Shangtu . Llenor stubbornly shook her head . Priscilla Queen of Heaven wanted Defoe delivered to Ro Dae Ho . Llenor meant to see it done . Dropping him on the edge of the desert was not nearly good enough . Defoe could hardly believe that a couple of days ago he did not much care what happened to Llenor once he was safe . Now he cared too much . They left the Princess Lisa-Marie on Wyvyrn-back . Qiip the flight officer took them as far as the plateau edge , with the roc following . There they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Llenor to go back with Qiip . " The roc can take me into Shangtu . " " Right . Have you ever soloed on a roc ? " Defoe admitted he had not . " And how would I get my bird back ? " He gave in and got aboard . Llenor donned her wings and they took off , soaring over the rolling dunes . Kilometers of red-blonde sand slid silently beneath the roc 's wing tips . Then suddenly , the desert dipped down and disappeared , turning into green terraced rice fields . Clouds boiled out of a central canyon choked with tall trees . Shangtu itself floated above the canyon , a bit of heaven anchored by colossal steel cables . Shaped like a huge squat pagoda , the port sat atop a giant aerostat , a relic from days when only Ariel 's uppermost atmosphere was habitable . Skycycles , fliers , and ultralights darted in and out of landing pads spaced around the flattened pagoda . Ro Dae Ho had a private landing pad , surrounded by hanging gardens and tinkling bells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint that their coming was hardly a surprise . He was a wispy oriental wearing dragon pants and a black happi coat , with a shaved head , pale olive skin and a long white beard . A young green-skinned hermaphrodite hung on his arm . " Greetings , greetings . " He bowed to both of them . " Please enter my poor house . " Chimp gardeners took charge of the roc . Defoe and Llenor followed their host through a carved gate , around a dark lacquered spirit screen , past two Bug Warrior bodyguards hired from a local hive . Light from paper lanterns gleamed on their recoilless cannons and dark armored carapaces . Ro Dae Ho 's poor house turned out to be a light-weight mansion with rice paper walls supported by slender columns . Flowers bloomed in unexpected spots - scarlet peonies and blue-white forget-me-nots . The place was set for a feast , another sign Ro Dae Ho knew they were coming . Uncle Ho , as he asked to be called , raised a glass of rice wine in honor of his guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk on an empty stomach . " Defoe looked to Llenor . She should already be gone . Every second in Shangtu compounded her risk . But she smiled , as if to say , " What 's the harm in one last supper ? " Enthusiastic green-skinned serving girls in skimpy sarongs showed them to the seats of honor . Laughing and giggling , they tucked Defoe 's knees beneath the table , their smooth leaf-green skin smelling of musk . Shangtu 's population hosted a symbiotic green algae in their skin and germ plasm . Under the perpetual daylight of the Subsolar Plateau the algae pumped glucose directly into their bloodstreams , promoting shaved heads and nudity - saving on servant upkeep . Food arrived , first a long series of delightful soups and hors d'oeuvres - which easily satisfied Defoe . Just when he thought they might be done , the meal itself appeared , dish after dish in big covered pots . He looked uneasily over at Llenor . This was taking way too long , but it seemed useless to protest . More rice wine went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Defoe 's two pretty servers made a game of slipping food onto his plate . He felt like he was on a double date , where " No " meant " Yes " and food had taken the place of sex . When he managed to fend them off , Uncle Ho himself would lean around the hermaphrodite and dip his chopsticks into a pot , offering Defoe " something really special . " The two towering Bug Warriors watched over the meal like a pair of high-tech samurai . Sweets came , and the pots were cleared away . Freed from his servers , Defoe took a moment to uncramp his legs , walking about a bit with Llenor . " This looks to be about over . " She laughed . " That 's not how they do things in Shangtu . Sweets mean the middle of the meal . " She squeezed his hand , " A couple more dishes and I 'll be gone . " Defoe sat down . Another course arrived . As he raised chopsticks to his lips a scrambled call came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're coming in . " ) He jumped up , spilling his chopsticks , shouting to Llenor , " Get the hell out of here . " She was already on her feet . Uncle Ho must have heard the call too . Shoving the hermaphrodite off his lap , he politely advised the servants to take cover , then hustled Defoe and Llenor past the spirit screen onto his private landing pad . Bug Warriors thudded behind them , venom spines erect . Chimps had the roc ready . Llenor struggled into her wings . Uncle Ho handed her a plastic stinger , saying , " As soon as you clear the city , dive for the cloud forest . " Nodding grimly , she pocketed the stinger , then turned to Defoe . Her grim look dissolved . No need to worry about when they would part , that had been taken from her hands . For the first and likely last time he kissed her . Even in the midst of that mad moment , the kiss blanked out everything else . Fear and alarm vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed by her upturned face and windblown hair . Dark shapes were coming down . Out the corner of his eye , he saw mini-profile parasails dropping toward them , the same type used by Medusa 's marine contingent . Breaking contact , he begged her to run . Without saying good-bye , she scrambled aboard the waiting bird . The roc took off , flapping for altitude . Gunfire rattled overhead . Bug Warriors flung back covering fire . Suddenly remembering he was a non-combatant , Defoe threw himself onto the deck . Shooting got louder , and closer , ricocheting around him . One Bug took a direct hit . A cannon shell in the thorax sent it spinning off the edge of the pad , still firing madly . Defoe looked up . Uncle Ho lay half a meter away , eyes clamped shut , hugging the landing pad . Horrified , Defoe searched the sky for Llenor . He spotted her roc , tumbling toward the lower levels of the Shangtu pagoda , her pack saddle empty . Then he saw Llenor in a stoop , wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her . He leaped to his feet , opening his mouth to shout something useless . His legs promptly buckled under him . Anesthetic gas . Defoe recognized the symptoms of the non-lethal incapacitant . The landing pad reeled and tilted , then slammed into him . Hard . " If you are looking for trouble , you 've come to the right place . " - Elvis , Christmas Special 1968 DEFOE AWOKE on his back , staring up at a hairy , high-browed face with little furry ears . Huge white fangs curved down from beneath big cat 's eyes . He blinked and tried to rise , saying , " Boy ! Am I glad to see you . " " Same to you , " the being above him replied . He was a SuperCat . Homo smilodon . With burly shoulders , tawny fur , human limbs and torso , biped stance and a short bobbed tail . He wore body armor and carried a recoilless assault rifle . Fixed to his nose was a filtration mask . Called Rowlf , he commanded the Medusa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped him to his feet . Defoe found he had a medikit strapped to his arm , neutralizing the anesthetic . Bug warrior parts were scattered about the landing pad . Ro Dae Ho lay sleeping peacefully - not knowing how lucky he was . Defoe 's internal chronometer told him forty-one minutes had passed . Needless to say a lot had happened . Way too much from what he could see . He broadcasted a frantic call to Llenor . No answer . Defoe prayed to Saint Priscilla that did not mean she was dead- the most logical explanation . He remembered how the Queen of Heaven stood on the great white steps at Graceland , promising to see him safely to Shangtu . But Priscilla said nothing about Llenor . How hideously unfair . Lienor was the Believer . The one Elvis ought to be looking out for . If there was an Elvis . There is nothing like gunfire to make you get religion . Rowlf hustled him past the spirit screen into Ro Dae Ho 's poor house , which now more closely fit its description . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rice squished underfoot . Uncle Ho 's young hermaphrodite was sprawled dead on the floor , alongside a green  --  skinned serving girl . Both had been shot through the head at close range . Beside the girl lay a shattered vase and a spray of blue-white forget-me  --  nots . Two SuperCats were holding down an angry young man with a crewcut , wearing body armor and a gray Militia uniform . That was something utterly unexpected . Defoe wondered where the Settler had come from , and why two SuperCats were practically sitting on him . " What happened here ? " Rowlf nodded his fanged head at the angry Settler . " He saw that greenie with tits and a prick and went berserk . He shot him-her , then shot the girl before we could disarm him . " Defoe stared stupidly at the carnage , so used to hearing Old Speak that the SuperCat 's Universal barely made sense . Seeing him standing there , the young Settler shouted , " Tell these mutant bastards to let me go . " Shaking off his surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the man 's shoulder . This time he remembered to use Universal . " I 've got a suggestion for you . Homo sapien to Homo sapien . " The young Settler glared up at him . If they really did share DNA , it would be a distinct disappointment . " Do what these Cats say , " Defoe advised , " and do n't call then names . Otherwise they are going to give up , and just blow out your brains . " The Militia man squirmed in the SuperCat 's grip . " Make them give me my gun back . " Defoe shrugged , " They are n't likely to listen to me . " The Settler cursed and called him a traitor . Defoe guessed he had been added to the man 's must-kill list . " Get him up , " Rowlf ordered . " We 've got to go . There 's a hovership waiting to take us to a landing zone at the edge of the desert . " SuperCats dragged the struggling Settler to his feet and they headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waiting at the bottom of the ramp were four more SuperCats , with assault rifles trained at the doorway . Firing erupted from the corridor beyond . " We 're going out , " Rowlf told him . " Take this , there might be trouble . " Defoe wanted to say things had gone way beyond trouble , but he stopped , shocked by what the SuperCat had handed him . It was a plastic stinger , just like Ro Dae Ho had given Llenor . Not at all regulation issue for the Medusa 's marines . He stared at the weapon . " Where did you get this ? " " Off a female . " Rowlf peeked through the doorway into the corridor , sizing up the situation . Two dead SuperChimps lay face down in the hall . " What sort of female ? " Defoe demanded . The SuperCat glanced back at him . " Your sort . " Defoe hoped to heaven Rowlf did not mean off her body . " Is she okay ? Where can I see her ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And headed for the hovership and the LZ . You 'll see her when we get there . " Defoe said a swift thank you to Saint Priscilla , or Elvis , or whoever looked over Llenor . She was alive . And he would be seeing her , or so the SuperCat said . Almost too much to be believed . Especially since she still did not answer his calls . Stepping over the two dead SuperChimps , they headed out into the halls of Shangtu pagoda . As they worked their way down the ramps to the lower levels , Defoe saw more dead Chimps . Mostly shot from behind , as though they had been running . He also saw more Militia in body armor waving big recoilless assault rifles - not at all pleased to see SuperCats with one of their own in custody . Defoe did not like the Settlers " hard looks , or the shells that kept flying through Shangtu 's paper walls . " What is all the shooting for ? " Aside from the occasional fragmented Bug Warrior , he saw no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SuperChimps . " " What in hell for ? " Rowlf kept staring straight ahead , over the sights of his recoilless rifle . " They are worked up about what happened at Subsolar Station . " " Shangtu Chimps did not do that . " " I do n't think they care . " Defoe could not fathom that attitude . He could understand killing the Bug Warriors . You had to do that . Bugs could not be reasoned with . Given orders to shoot , they would keep firing until they ran out of ammunition , then go down swinging the empty weapon . It took a cannon shell to convince them to cease fire . But Chimps were different . Chimps were , well - Chimps . Sure they could be dangerous ; more so than Defoe had ever imagined . But they were not near as deadly as Homo Sapiens . " Man the wise " had a history of mass slaughter that stretched back over a thousand millennia and hundreds of light-years . " That 's stupid , " he told the SuperCat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human survivor . " Rowlf replied with a toothy grin , " Congratulations . " He had his share of human genes , mixed with those of old-time carnivores . " Maybe the Militia will give you a medal . " " What are Settlers even doing here ? " " They are taking over Shangtu . We just came to get you out . " Thank Elvis for that . Shangtu could look forward to hard times . There were no more than a handful of folks aboard Shangtu pagoda that the new owners considered " really " human . And this SuperChimp massacre would set the tone for their dealings with Thals , clones , greenies , and other " bioconstructs . " He shook his head . " Let 's get to the landing zone . " And Llenor . The main landing deck jutted out from the lowest level of the pagoda . Llenor 's roc lay on the pad , turned into an untidy pile of feathers by the fall . A hovership waited to take them to the LZ , surrounded by more Militia with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Llenor . Her green sleeveless jacket and harlequin flight suit stood out among the gray Militia uniforms . Her wings had been stripped off , and her hands were cuffed behind her back . They had covered her head with an isolation helmet , keeping her from sending or receiving signals . An argument ensued . The Militia meant to keep Llenor , and wanted their man as well . Rowlf said he did not care about the local female meaning Llenor-but he was not giving up his prisoner until his team was safely aboard the armored hovership . A minimum precaution in the face of angry Militia , who hated SuperCats as much as they hated Chimps and greenies - maybe even more . Defoe heard the warning snicker of safeties going off . Seeing the conquerors of Shangtu about to shoot it out right there on the main landing pad , he seized Rowlf 's furry arm , " Let me talk . " " Talk all you like , " the SuperCat snarled . " But I am not giving up this man until we are aboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Militia Captain . She was black  --  skinned with a pearl stud in her nose and dreadlocks hanging below her helmet . " Your man is under arrest for murder . " " Murder ? " The Militia woman looked dumfounded . " He killed two people back up there on the pagoda . " " That 's right , " Rowlf snarled . " You can shoot Chimps , but not greenies . " Defoe wished the SuperCat would butt out . He had just blown hal their case . The Militia would hardly call killing a couple of greenie ; murder , not with SuperCats for witnesses . " This is a military operation , " the Militia Captain protested figuring that excused random deaths among defenseless bystanders . " Right . And your man will face a military court aboard the Medusa . " " Who are you to decide this ? " the woman demanded . " Daniel Defoe , pilot first class , assigned to Medusa . " The Militia Captain 's resolve crumbled . Standing up to furry fang  --  toothed mutants was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medusa officer was entirely different . The Settlers needed the Medusa . She was the closest thing to a warship insystem - their prime backup on a planet teaming with objectionable types . Without the merchant cruiser , and her arsenal of anti-matter warheads , the colonists were no better than a bunch of gun-armed greenies . Seeing the Militia woman 's hesitation , Defoe swiftly offered her an out , " How about a prisoner exchange ? " " What do you mean ? " she sounded suspicious . " I will turn your man over to you , to be held aboard the Cape Colony until a military court can be convened , if you give me the woman you have to be held aboard the Medusa . " Defoe did not much care what happened to the murderous young Settler , so long as he got Llenor . " Held for what ? " asked the Militia Captain . " She is a convicted criminal - her sentence just needs to be carried out . " " So you say . But she is also part of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military court . " He could see the Militia woman 's mental programming sorting options . She much preferred to solve the dilemma by gunning down the SuperCats and taking both prisoners back to Cape Colony . Defoe 's offer came a distant second . But a point blank gun battle is a chancy exercise . While turning Llenor over to a military court was practically her duty - and way better than seeing one of her men dragged offplanet by a gang of armed mutants . " Agreed . " She ordered her people to part ranks . They made the trade at the hovership hatch , with Rowlf 's squad covering the exchange from inside . Llenor was hauled aboard , and the armored hatch slammed shut . They were off . " Shit , that was close . " Defoe shook with relief , barely believing they were free . Rowlf slid his assault rife safety back on . " You handled that enraged female admirably . " My specialty , Defoe thought . " Why in the world are you working with them ? They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got Shangtu . That 's absurd ! " Rowlf shrugged , " That 's orders . " Marine commanders could not be blamed for policy blunders , they merely carried them out . " Damn . " Defoe was happier than ever to be a non-combatant . He looked over at Llenor . " Then I order you to take off her cuffs and helmet . " " How ? " Rowlf looked quizzical . " The code keys are with that Militia female on the landing pad . " Right . Realizing he had screwed up once again , Defoe slumped down in the seat alongside Llenor . At least she was alive . Though right now she could neither hear nor see what was happening around her . A blessing given the circumstances . Reaching over , he took one of her bound hands in his . She started , then relaxed . Their fingers interlaced . Did she even know it was him ? Probably . She had that trusting sense about things , the sure feeling that Elvis would somehow provide . Defoe hoped the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her out of this . They held hands all the way to the LZ . Then onto the shuttle , and into orbit . When the shuttle docked with Medusa , Defoe went to an immediate face-to-face with his skipper . She was a slim , black-haired , no-nonsense CO , with luminous almond eyes , able to command a merchant cruiser or sit on an admiralty court . That was no coincidence . Defoe was Medusa 's chief pilot . Captain Tiffany Suzuki 's main job was to hold the balance of power in Prospero system . The colonists aboard Cape Colony would more than double Ariel 's human population . Already tension ran high between incoming Settlers and the original indigenous human population-not to mention the Thals , Chimps , Bugs , etc . It was Suzuki 's job to hold the ring . Medusa , with her orbit-to-surface missiles and anti-matter warheads , was meant to overawe any possible opposition . To see the colonists planted more or less peacefully on Ariel . Defoe was glad not to have that job . A single trip to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful . That faint hope was gone . A null program . Worse was bound to come . He made his report as coherently as he could , with two major omissions . He made no mention of virtual visits to Graceland , and communing with Elvis , Priscilla , etc . Defoe wanted to preserve some credibility with his boss . And he said nothing about any personal feelings for Llenor . His pitch had to be untainted by any touch of love or insanity . Which left him relying heavily on coincidence , and Llenor 's native nobility . Captain Suzuki was at best partly convinced . " This wanted felon just happened to fly by ? And seeing you in trouble she swooped you up , risking her own freedom to take you to Shangtu ? " " But she is not a felon , " Defoe protested . " That 's the point . " " So you say . " " Her actions speak for her . " Suzuki looked hard at him . Did she suspect she was talking to a man in love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call on Cape Colony . " She hologrammed them aboard the colony ship . Even virtual visits to Cape Colony made Defoe uneasy . She was not a lucky ship . Infamously unlucky , in fact . Cape Colony had the misfortune to make first official contact with the Bugs . Headed for the Deneb Kaitos with a load of colonists from Tau Ceti , she had been hijacked by Eridani slavers . The slavers had already been taken over by the Bugs , who proceeded to weed through the captive colonists , killing all the males and any women over reproductive age . None of the killings were out of malice . Bugs were not capable of disliking humans - reserving their hatred for Bugs from other hives . They just did not see why humans needed two sexes and nonbreeders . Eventually the Bugs were brought to heel , but not before giving Cape Colony a very bad name . Otherwise she was a normal high-g colony ship , a great gravity drive starship the size and shape of a small moon , stuffed with colonists and equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room could be made below . The virtual conference with the colonial leaders was a bust . They might as well be talking to Bugs , The Settler leaders knew all about Llenor . If Medusa did not immediately court-martial her on kidnapping charges , they should hand her over for execution . Captain Suzuki tried to explain that they were seeking something more like a review , with a chance for a pardon , or a commuted sentence . Impossible . The best they could offer was to retry her , noting she had already lost a virtual appeal to the high court on Mt . Zion . The colonists were more concerned with laying hands on Amanda - for jail break , hijacking , and going AWOL . Warrants were also out for Evie , Lilith , and Lucifer , all listed as accomplices . And for Marilyn , who had broken a valid brothel contract . ( Defoe was amazed not to see Elvis and Priscilla on the list.f Did he have any idea where the Princess Lisa-Marie had been headed ? They could not fathom why Defoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily he was only aboard in 3V . Otherwise he would never have gotten off Cape Colony . But it was hard to lay hands on a bolo . He and Suzuki winked back aboard Medusa . Defoe grimaced , " That was an unpleasant waste of time . Those fools are utterly out of it . Not even in near orbit . A new trial from the same Settler courts . What a farce . " His Captain agreed . " Why put her through the agony ? Better to just fry her ourselves . Dump her out over Dayside , and be done with it . " Defoe stared at her . " You 're all heart . " " Comes with the job , " Suzuki assured him . " Does n't anyone in the Home Systems see the senselessness of sending gun-toting Humanists to a world full of folks they hate ? " Suzuki shook her head . " Nobody sent them . They wanted to come here . Everyone aboard the Cape Colony is an enthusiastic volunteer . " " Then why do n't Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I suppose they find them as obnoxious as we do . " " Shit . " There was nothing like a sympathetic talk with the Settlers for instilling mad helpless rage . Defoe kept thinking about Llenor , alone in the brig . They had taken off the helmet and cuffs , but she was still locked in a signal-proof cell waiting to die for something she did not do . While that young colonist who murdered the hermaphrodite and serving girl was probably relaxing in his cabin , facing at worst a reprimand . Or maybe a good conduct citation . Defoe started pacing the command deck . " We have to do something . " " Like what ? " Captain Suzuki followed him with her eyes . " Stop them ourselves , " he suggested . " How ? " " We have the power . This ship is armed to the molars with warheads , smart bombs , Osiris missiles , toothy marines ... " " It does not work that way , " Suzuki patiently explained . " Our job is to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's up to the inhabitants . " " But Ariel is already settled . " By clones , Chimps , Thals , greenies , and whatnot . " Sparsely inhabited , by whoever or whatever happened to be at hand . These people are as much a part of a transition ecology as the giant trees and flying megafauna . Ariel 's biosphere is expanding , the surface will someday be habitable ; and Settlers already have the votes to elect any government they want . Cape Colony is hardly the end of it . More ships are on the way . " " Yeah , " Defoe agreed . " But what would Elvis say ? " " Elvis ? " Suzuki laughed . " Do n't try to tell me you 're a Believer now . " " Not really . " He stopped pacing and stared at her . " But we have to take some responsibility . The human race has to be more than an ingenious means of spreading intestinal bacteria to the stars . " Suzuki sighed . " You 're taking this too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn hard . Llenor was going to die for crimes he was a thousand percent sure she did not do . People who put themselves on the line to help him would be hunted down for their pains . And the slaughter he had seen at Shangtu was set to spread throughout the planet . It made him want to scream . " You 've been through a lot , " Suzuki suggested . No argument there . " Look , I 'll hold onto Llenor as long as I can , " she suggested . " Maybe go through the motions of a court martial . Meanwhile , take some R and R. Use the gig to go to Pair-a-Dice . Come back when you feel more yourself . " He nodded . That sounded semi-reasonable , but at best it was a stall . Suzuki would eventually turn Llenor over to the Settlers . He could see it in her face . " And one more thing ... " " What 's that ? " " Stay off the religious channel . Captain 's orders . That 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , with hologram deities and a simulated hereafter . " " Right . " Nothing like being mothered by his Captain . " But tell me something . How did you know I would be at Shangtu ? " Suzuki shrugged , " That was strange . The Militia started planning to hit Shangtu as soon as they lost Subsolar Station - to get a permanent foothold on the plateau . Then we got a tip telling us to look for you in the house of Ro Dae Ho . It came in scrambled using our own codes , and had everything , time , date , even your private ID prefix . We thought it had to be from you . The attack was adjusted accordingly . " Strange ? Maybe . Extra weird was more like it . Who could have made that call ? He certainly had n't . Captain Suzuki arched an eyebrow , " Any explanation ? " " Someone 's looking out for me . " Defoe left the cabin , and then the ship . Pair-a-Dice did not make him feel a whit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a geosync point attached to Freeport by the Pair-a-Dice beanstalk . Empty space had been turned into a freeform collection of bars , 3V brothels , Feelie palaces and gambling arcades , serving no socially redeeming purpose except to scramble unsuspecting neurons . Defoe stayed resolutely away from the real stuff , inhabiting the most honky-tonk holo bars , with 3V effects too shoddy to be taken seriously . The last thing he wanted was to end up spilling his guts to some sympathetic whore . Some lost and likeable girl who would agree that life was totally rotten , but if he could just find it in his heart to fuck her and forget Llenor he would feel lots better . Instead he ended up at Any Way You Want It . The autobar served home-brewed bourbon , and hologram hookers took the customers into chat rooms for ultrasafe sex - with everything from orchestrated accompaniment to 3V barnyard animals . Just the sort of absolute seediness Defoe desperately needed . He had ordered his umpteenth bourbon when an especially lovely holo flicked into being beside him . Turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was busy maintaining his blood alcohol . But before the sentence got half out he stopped , staring at the holo . It was Amanda . She was not wearing her powder blue uniform or machine pistol- just some strategically placed sequins . But there was no mistaking that angelic face . She nodded toward the chat rooms , " We need to talk . " Defoe found an empty cubical , sealed the door , and sat down on the futon without bothering to remove the plastic cover . " Sober yourself up , " she told him . Chat rooms came equipped with medikits , just in case . He strapped one on , setting it for detox . The bourbon melted away . Instead of being drunk , he was just miserable . " I warned you , " she reminded him . " But it was not my fault . " That sounded horribly hollow . " Right . Otherwise you would be seeing me in person . Now what are you going to do about it ? " " What can I do ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her blonde head . " Look , I had a lover named Kia . We were crazy about each other . So much in love they had to kill one of us to keep us apart . Do n't let that happen to you . " " How can I stop it ? " " Start by going to Graceland . No better place to take your troubles than straight to the King . " Amanda looked dead serious , though she had never seemed the religious type . There were Graceland Shrines all over Human Space , some small and shabby , others huge and garish . Defoe had even seen the original one on Old Earth , still preserved at the heart of Greater Memphis . The Pair-a  --  Dice shrine looked nothing like that stone and brick mansion under glass . Designed to blend with the local decor , the Pair-a-Dice shrine was a glittering hologram copy of the legendary Las Vegas Hilton , pulsing to the beat of " Heartbreak Hotel . " Worshipers checked in through a plush antique lobby , served by oldfashioned elevators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Las Vegas strip shone in towering neon through wraparound windows . Elvis was there , in white and gold regalia , rings sparkling on his fingers . With him was preacher Rick , wearing his suit-of-lights . Elvis grinned , " Good to see ya , son . Ready to go into action ? " " Doing what ? " Defoe felt absurdly foolish , asking advice from a bolo - but this is what it had come to . " Doing what 's right , " Elvis replied . " You 've lost the most precious thing on the planet ... " " We 're not on a planet , " Defoe pointed out . They were in a hologram hotel on a geosync station , connected to Ariel by thousands of klicks of beanstalk . " Do n't matter . You 've lost a loving woman . Ai n't nothin " in the whole cosmos as important as that . Believe me , the King knows what that 's like . People like to pretend otherwise , but it 's women that make the galaxy go round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " em . And be ready to do right by " em . Llenor is some special woman . You know that , do n't you ? " Defoe said he did . " So , are you set to do right ? " " How ? " " By going and getting her . " " And then what ? " Even if he could get Llenor out of the Medusa 's brig , she would still be wanted under Settler Law . Every station , every beanstalk , every ship headed outsystem would be closed to them . They would have nowhere to go , with the Militia at their heels . Even Suzuki would be honor-bound to help track them down . Brother Rick chuckled . " I know it seems like the whole universe is against you . But remember - you got the King in your corner . " Fine . Easy for him to say . He was a holo in a make-believe hotel . Defoe could not simply escape to some virtual neverland . " That 's the truth , " Elvis assured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " " She 's in a locked cell . " Elvis smirked . " Rick will be with you . Wo n't you , Rick ? " His stepbrother nodded . " And we got gigarams of memory backing us . What 's a few little door locks ? C'm on , son , get your show on the road . " Utter madness . But in minutes Defoe was back aboard the gig , headed for Medusa . Rick was with him , ready for action , having exchanged his suit-of-lights for jeans and an Elvis windbreaker . He grinned at Defoe . " Nervous ? " Defoe nodded . It was halfway through the midwatch . Things aboard ship should be quiet . But ... " Do n't sweat it , " Rick advised . " Nobody will see me but you . As soon as you get to your cabin , key into your terminal . I 'll take it from there . " He nodded again . Defoe did not think they would have much trouble breaking into the brig . The locks were keyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers out . It was what would happen afterward that had him worried . " Look . " Rick warmed to his sermon . " I know it ai n't easy being touched by the King . Look at me . I lost my dad - my real dad . Everyone knows I 'm Elvis 's step-brother . But that was not good enough for Elvis . He made me his brother . His dad became my dad . An " when he took me on the road as a teenager , I nearly lost my mom too . Sometimes you just have to do what 's right , and say to hell with the rest . " Defoe did not reply . He was blowing his bridges behind him . Giving up everything . And for what ? A marine guard met him at the lock , muscles rippling beneath her fur . The saber-toothed female purred happily , " Been having fun ? " She was being polite ; SuperCats did not give a thin damn what Nomo Sapiens did off-duty . " Just the usual . " Defoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show he was hiding something . But anyone who came back from Pair-a-Dice without something to be ashamed of had thoroughly wasted his R and R. He went to his cabin , doused the lights , and set the door to " Do not disturb . " As if he meant to sleep it off . Pulling his personal terminal over to the bed , he opened it to a Pair-a-Dice channel . A silent message flashed onscreen , " Shake , Rattle , and Roll . " Defoe eased out the door . Hiding in his flight suit was the stinger Ro Dae Ho had given to Llenor - and Rowlf had given to him . Rick met him halfway to the brig . " Set the stinger for stun . There 's one guard , and the lock 's coded to take your thumb print . " Defoe nodded , nervously palming the stinger in his left hand . A SuperCat lounged by the brig lock . " What goes , human ? " " Come to take the prisoner to a face-to-face interrogation . Here 's my authorization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , to get the saber-tooth 's attention , he triggered the stinger with his left . A heat-seeking hornet homed in on the surprised SuperCat , knocking him out before he could snarl a complaint . Slinging the sleeping saber-tooth over his shoulder , Defoe thumbed the lock . Llenor was in the first cell . There were no other prisoners-until now Medusa had been a very law abiding ship . He thumbed the cell lock , and the door dilated . She shot him a very surprised look . He must have been a sight showing up at her cell door with a Homo smilodon slumped over his shoulder , accompanied by a grinning archangel in blue jeans and an Elvis jacket . But she had sense enough not to shout about it , helping him lay the SuperCat down on her bed-pad . Then he took her hand . Neither dared speak . Who knew what might set off an alarm ? But they could kiss . And did . Not a lingering first kiss , like the last one . This one was quick and delicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking aboard the Lisa-Marie . Rick discreetly disappeared . Giving a squeeze that meant , " Follow me , " he led Llenor out of the brig , sealing the doors behind them , headed for the control deck . Getting Llenor sprung was the easy part - now they badly needed somewhere to run to . Going back to the gig was pointless ; the little low-g runabout could not take them far enough . Medusa could home in on the gig 's emissions , letting Suzuki either hunt them down or cancel his contract with an antimatter warhead . Defoe 's sole choice was to take over the ship . Signaling Llenor to stand out of sight , he thumbed the control deck lock . The bridge door dilated . The watch officer , a comtech named Ducey , looked up and smiled . He never got a chance to say hello . Defoe fired as he stepped in , and Ducey slumped in his seat . Llenor scooted through the door , sealing the lock behind her . Defoe immediately disengaged the autopilot , taking over control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hitting the manual override on DAMAGE CONTROL , he ordered the keel companionway to decompress . Alarms dopplered through the Medusa . Defoe sounded GENERAL QUARTERS , sending everyone scrambling to their action stations . But with the keel companionway decompressed , Suzuki and the control crew would have to suit up to get to the bridge . Anxious calls came in , which he studiously ignored , using the antivirus defenses to seal off communications - isolating the various action stations , as if they were infected by an outside attack . All orders now had to come from the command deck . He gave everyone a couple more seconds to suit up and get to their stations , then he started jettisoning sections of the ship . All action stations doubled as escape pods , and in an emergency could be ejected into orbit . So far as Defoe could see , this qualified as a dire emergency . Llenor helped him strap the sleeping Ducey into one of the bridge escape pods . Then Defoe ejected him as well , emptying the ship . Leaving them alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruiser had been stripped down to her command deck , main engines , anti-matter tanks , and armory , with its stock of Osiris missiles . For the moment at least , Defoe had complete command of the most powerful fighting machine insystem . Not a responsibility he craved . " Well done , son . " Elvis sat in the command couch , which was tilted back and turned to face the cabin , an electric guitar cradled in his lap . He looked almighty pleased . " The King himself could not have done it more neatly . " Defoe glared at the 3V intrusion . " Do n't be so modest . This is what you wanted . What you aimed at all along . " He felt silly arguing with a holo . " Close enough , " Elvis admitted . Defoe snorted . He had been had . Outwitted by a brainless holo , backed by gigarams of computing capacity . Defoe cursed whoever first taught computers to play chess . He turned to look at Llenor , who had her green eyes fixed on Elvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She tore her gaze off the King , asking , " What do you mean ? " Defoe studied her innocent-looking face , with its tattooed list of heinous crimes . Could she have been conning him too ? Defoe hated to believe it . He could still taste her latest kiss , but did not know how much to trust her . " You really do n't know ? " She shook her head , looking genuinely mystified . Defoe waved at Elvis lounging in the command couch , tuning his virtual guitar . " He put us here . " " Hey , " Elvis looked up from the guitar . " You did most of this yourself . A damn good job too . The King 's proud of you . " Llenor smiled quizzically , " Of course he did . He 's the King . " Right . Defoe sighed . She still earnestly meant to make a Believer out of him . " I mean he planned all this from the moment I touched down on the plateau - maybe even before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You saving me . Our trip to Shangtu . The-Militia attack . Your capture . My saving you ... " " Hold on , " Elvis objected , " the Militia made that attack on their own . I 've got no hold on them . And those Chimps were only supposed to spook you . " " They did that , " Defoe admitted . " But that massacre was their notion . You ca n't always tell what an ape will do . Did I ever tell you about Scatter ? He was just your normal ape , no human genes , but he used to eat with a fork . Drinkin " bourbon at the table . One time ... " Defoe cut the story short . " But you did tell Suzuki that I would be at the House of Ro Dae Ho . You set up Llenor , getting her arrested , and taken aboard ship , forcing me to come after her . " " I do n't remember anyone twisting your arm . " Elvis turned to Llenor , looking genuinely contrite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Llenor , I am truly sorry for what you were put through to get here . If there were any other way , believe me , we would have done it differently . " Defoe fumed . He was seeing the King 's legendary style with women , sincere , attentive , respectful , and immensely successful . It certainly worked with Llenor . She forgave Elvis at once . " We 're here . We have the ship . That 's what matters . " Then she turned to Defoe , taking his hand , pulling him to her . The King might be irresistible , but he was still only a hologram . Llenor wanted the real thing . Her arm went around Defoe 's waist , pressing her body against his . For all her guileless youth , she was a ship 's captain , accustomed to getting what she wanted . She spoke softly and sincerely , " I did not plan any of this - but I 'm glad it happened . This ship has been our greatest fear , hanging overhead , loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elvis grinned . Defoe ignored him , completely taken by the woman in his arms . They were right . Medusa and her anti-matter arsenal had become a sword hanging over everyone . Suzuki herself said the ship would never be used to bring justice , just to see that people obeyed . Now he had that power in his hands . What should he do with it ? Bomb the Militia bases ? Threaten to blow up Cape Colony ? Unthinkable . He did not want such power . No one should have it . He stared at Llenor . " So now what ? " She looked to Elvis . The King struck a chord on his guitar , then pretended to adjust the tuning . " I think you know what we need to do . " She looked back at Defoe . " Take her down . " " Crash her ? " Medusa was not made to enter atmosphere . Looking up , Elvis agreed , " Only way to level the playing field . So long as this ship hangs over the planet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been thinking more along the lines of heading outsystem at as near to light speed as they could go . But where would they head in a hijacked starship ? Not for the bright lights of civilization . They 'd have to go deeper into the Outback , looking to lose themselves in some untamed system . Llenor saw no need for that . Ariel was as untamed and Outback as they come . And what better place to get lost than on her home planet ? He stared at her . Damn . He did not mean to be a hero . Much less a martyr . Defoe did not like giving up everything for folks he did not know , and was never likely to meet . But did he have any choice ? He let go of Llenor . Whatever happened , he did not want to blame it on her , even subconsciously . Llenor was already overburdened with other people 's mistakes . He settled into the co-pilot 's couch , thinking how much he had wanted a ship of his own . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning on his guitar . " Must be a rush . " " What ? " " Flying a ship like this . " Defoe smiled . " Makes everything else seem to be standing still . " A highg starship literally slowed down the universe . No one could ever catch him . In a matter of months ship-time he could be at the fringes of the galaxy , headed for Andromeda , or the Magellanic Clouds . But that meant eternal exile . Among beings that made SuperChimps seem like kissing cousins . He reached out and took the controls . " Of course , near light-speeds do n't muss your hair . " Medusa could take you halfway across the cosmos in living room comfort . " The only way to get a feeling of speed is to aim her at something big , then open the throttle . " " Like a planet . " Elvis grinned . Like Ariel . He looked at Llenor . She came over to sit on the arm of the command couch , putting her hand on his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit , sending them plunging toward the planet . " What is your point of impact ? " Llenor asked quietly , showing a pilot 's professional interest . Defoe had plenty of planet to pick from . All of Darkside was virtually uninhabited . Even on Dayside , inhabited points were few and far between . Wherever they hit , it would be a huge bang . The missile warheads were bad enough , but the ship 's own anti-matter tanks were even more explosive . It would be like an asteroid impact . He gave her coordinates for a point beyond the Great Reach , on the far side of the Subsolar Plateau halfway to the Twilight Belt . She nodded . " Good choice . " " The nearest populated point will be the Dayside Archipelago , a quarter of the planet away . They should be safe enough . " Unlike an asteroid impact , most of the energy from anti-matter explosion would be released as hard radiation , deflected into space . He sat back to watch Ariel 's white image grow larger in the screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar , plunking out the most mournful , hillbilly , Bug hollow version of " My Darlin " Clementine : " " Inn-ahh Can-yun , Inn-ahh Cavv-errn , Ex-cav-vate-in " for ah mine , Dwell-t ah Mi-ner For-tee-nine-er An " his daugh-ah-t-er Clemm-enn-tine ... " Their fall became a plummet . Medusa hit the first tenuous layers of atmosphere and corona flared up to fill the screens . Elvis raised the beat , rapping out the chorus in time to the " Ode to Joy " from Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony : " Oh-my-Darlin " Oh-my-Darlin " Oh-my-Darlin " Clem-en-tine , **30;1982;TOOLONG , **29;2014;TOOLONG ... " Incandescent air surrounded the ship , cutting off all incoming signals . The King flickered and vanished . Communications blackout . Elvis had left the building . Defoe and Llenor were alone in the falling starship . She reached down to take his hand , as the cabin began to bounce and vibrate around them . Soon pieces would start to fly off . He looked up at her , " Time we left too . " He had been holding off until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her dive . Unsealing an escape pod , they crawled inside . The pod was not really built for two - but they were not about to be separated . Being bigger , Defoe wedged himself into the seat . Llenor climbed in onto his lap , sealing the hatch behind her . He had to reach around her to get at the armrest controls . Then he waited . Exiting the ship had to be neatly timed . If he ejected too soon , there was a chance he could be tracked . Cape Colony was below the horizon , and Pair-a-Dice beanstalk was on the wrong side of the planet - but someone might still be looking down from orbit . He meant to cover his escape by waiting until the ship started to break and burn . Of course if he waited too long , he and Llenor would be crushed and fried . He had to make this delicate decision with Llenor sitting on his lap . It was the most intimate moment they had ever shared - crammed together into a capsule not meant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was bouncing about as Medusa began to break up . Now or never . He hit pod-eject , and they went flying out of the wreck . Great . Though that was just half of it . To be really safe , they had to eject from the pod as well . The pod slowing for a soft landing would stand out like a signal flare amid the swiftly falling wreckage . A sure sign someone was inside , riding the pod down . But the two of them - using a chute pack - would be radar invisible , barely leaving a trace . The pod stabilized , no longer bounced about by the disintegrating ship . As he snapped the chute pack harness to his flight suit , Defoe realized that even though the pod had righted itself , Llenor was still shaking . With her face turned away , it was hard to tell if she was frightened , sobbing , or going into shock . Shit . What should he do ? She had been through enough to drive the average person schizo . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling capsule . What if she panicked and could not hold on ? She twisted about to look at him . Defoe saw she was giggling . Her giggle turned into a laugh . Leaning closer , she stopped long enough to whisper , " Love me tender . " " I 'll try , " he told her . " Now hold tight . " She grabbed his flight suit . Putting his arms around her , he triggered the release , hurtling them out of the capsule and into the screaming slipstream . Wham . The howling rush of air hit like a wall , nearly ripping Llenor out of his arms . Then they were falling free . He pulled the chute release . Another thump , and they were floating down , using the chute lines to head for the Subsolar Plateau . Far over the horizon , somewhere on the black , burning moonscape beneath the cloud plain , a mushroom cloud rose above Medusa 's impact point . Red-blonde sand rushed up to meet them . They hit , and Llenor bounced free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break anything vital . Picking himself up , he wiped grit out of his mouth , thinking , " This is where I came in . " Llenor came over and helped him out of his chute harness . Then they used the folding shovel from the survival pack to bury their chute . Llenor carefully divided the contents of the survival pack between them , making sure he was not carrying more than her . Defoe realized he was going to have to get used to having her next to him , making decisions , doing things for him that he had always done for himself . Setting off together under the near-noon sun , they headed for the pockets of habitation along the plateau edge . Before they got even halfway , Princess Lisa-Marie nosed over the horizon , looking to pick up another couple of outcasts.
