The Legend of Banzai Maguire By Susan Grant Dorchester Publishing Susan Grant Bree dropped her helmet bag by the front nose tire so she could inspect the sleek , gunmetal gray F-16 that was hers for the next few hours . To her , the fighter was breathtaking , like a piece of modern art , all smooth lines and sharp turns-beautiful in a deadly way , like a bird of prey . She waved to the arriving crew chief , the airman who would guide her through the engine start and taxi-out , and then climbed up a ladder into the cockpit , high above the ground . It wrapped around her snugly , that cockpit , as if the jet was custom made for her . Inside , she connected her G-suit to an air hose . Then , with an assortment of clips and straps , she attached herself to a seat that contained everything she needed for survival in the unlikely event of ejection : more survival kits , a radio , a GPS unit , a life raft , and , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she donned her helmet , leaving the mask loose for the moment . With a flick of her finger , the powerful engine rumbled to life . Then it was time to leave . Bree taxied out , Cam behind her . She always looked over her wingman 's aircraft , but she stared at Cam 's a little longer than usual as the feeling of foreboding came over her . Cam was fine , she told herself . Everything would be fine . It was aroutine sortie . Bree forced her eyes to the runway ahead of her . The sky was turning from gray to blue , clear and cloudless . You were born for this , remember ? Born to fly . Bree 's spirits lifted with the rising sun . " Razor flight 's ready , " she told the control tower . " Razor flight cleared for takeoff . " The tower controller 's voice came through her helmet headset . " Roger , " she replied . " Razor flight cleared for takeoff . " " Two . " Cam 's response told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearance for their " flight " meant clearance for them both . Cam would be rolling down the runway within seconds of Bree 's liftoff . Bree pushed the throttle up . The engine did n't rumble to life ; it exploded-a multi-megaton kick in the pants . Acceleration slammed her shoulder blades into the seat , and within seconds she was above a hundred knots and heading for twice that . The sheer force of the fighter never failed to awe her . All that power , in her control . At rotation speed , Bree wrapped a gloved hand around the control stick of her F-16 and pulled back gently , sending the jet skyward . A glance over her shoulder told her that Cam was airborne , too . Soon , Cam fell back to a tactical position a mile-and-a half behind her . Together , they headed to the airspace high above the DMZ between North Korea and South Korea . Bree leveled off at twenty-thousand feet . Somewhere high above her jet a modified 747 airliner bristling with radar and intelligence personnel eavesdropped on her radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters , speaking to them directly , all while coordinating with the region 's military commanders-and Washington , if needed . The integrated battlefield . So far , so good . Bree thought of the bad vibes she 'd felt before takeoff , and blamed them on too much sugar for breakfast . A burst of random radio static yanked Bree 's mind back where it belonged : in the here-and-now , where she did n't have the luxury of letting her thoughts wander . She rolled up on a wing and turned back to the shore . Here , the landscape was very rugged and remote . The forest came almost to the beach , what there was of one : a narrow and rocky strip of sand , decorated she 'd bet with mines and barbed wire instead of Pepsi bottles and empty containers of Coppertone . Another burst of static caught her attention as the coastline rolled under the belly of her jet . Cam shouted : " Razor-two , Radar , RAW , hits bearing two-two-zero ! " Bree 's pulse jumped with a surge of adrenaline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's threat warning system had gone off . A radar site on the ground had turned on to take a look , telling them that somewhere down there a North Korean surface-to-air missile operator was tracking Cam as a cat stalked a mouse . It might want to pounce ... or it may simply want to play . You never knew . But you had to treat every blip as a potential threat . Bree answered quickly so Cam would know that her own jet had n't picked up anything . " Razor-one is negative . " She hated surprises like this . She 'd read the intelligence briefing that morning , and it had been clean . Then she remembered a recent report on the North 's shoulder-launched missiles . It was impossible to keep track of those . They could be loaded in a car and driven anywhere . Worse , an actual visual sighting of an aircraft was n't necessary , as it had been in the old days . All anyone needed to complete the deal was a cooperative radar operator to help find a target . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Iris , what have you got for Razor flight ? " The surveillance plane would have heard Cam 's radio call . " Stand by . We 're checking it out . " " Checking it out , " she muttered to herself . They could afford to sound that laid-back ; they were sitting in a safer place than her wingman . But Bree tried to be patient . The intelligence gatherers were good , very good , and they 'd saved her butt plenty of times , but they were n't perfect . They could n't possibly keep track of every stray missile battery in North Korea . Bree 's threat warning system light illuminated . A swell of adrenaline froze her concentration into absolute focus . Her voice was calmer than she felt . " Razor-one has RAW . Nine o'clock . " " Two ! " She glanced from the warning light to her HUD , and then to the sky . It had been only seconds since Cam had reported her warning . Now someone was looking at Bree also . But radar alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The guys on the ground could aim all they wanted , but unless they were close enough , anything they lobbed over would fall short-and Bree was going to take care of that right now . She accelerated , climbing to a higher altitude , eager to put distance between her and the unknown threat before it became more than that . Cam followed , a half mile behind her . She 'd rather go south than farther north , and she hoped Cam realized that , but the people on the ground checking them out were in that direction , keeping them on the northern side of the border . It almost smelled like a set-up . But what could the North hope to gain by shooting aircraft engaged in operation Keep The Peace ? With tensions as high as they were , it did n't make sense . A loud alarm filled Bree 's headset . She warned , using the radio , " Missiles ! " " Talley ho ! " Cam shouted back . Bree looked over her shoulder , craning her neck . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her veins surged like an arctic dam breaking . " Counter , counter , " Bree 's threat warning system suggested in a female voice . But Bree was already releasing chaff and flying evasive maneuvers . Missiles came at you at supersonic speed . Confusing the little buggers was the only way out . " Counter , counter . " Bree gripped the control stick , wrenching it sideways , and pulled . Her vision narrowed . The sudden onset of Gs was almost too much for her suit and body to fight . She tightened her leg and stomach muscles to squeeze the blood pooling in her lower body back up to where she needed it most-in her head . Her oxygen mask slid down her sweaty face . Harsh breaths roared in her ears as she sucked air into her squashed lungs . Radio chatter filled her headset . Bree realized belatedly that Iris was transmitting something about confirmed reports of SAMs in the air . Well , duh . Sorry , no time to chew the fat . Got ta get rid of this missile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body , alternating between the bone-crushing force of gravity and negative Gs that propelled her insides upward and out . The missile streaked past . Woo hoo ! It had missed ! Thank you , God . But the missile passed her by only to lock on to Cam . Bree 's mood changed instantly . She was in a position to have a good visual on both of them . " Razor-two-Missile at eight o'clock , low ! " But Cam would n't have a visual . The SAM was in her blind spot : underneath and slightly behind . " Break right , " Bree directed . " Break right ! " Cam flipped over on her right wingtip . The missile followed . On Bree 's HUD , Cam 's jet was one of many shapes , whirling in a dizzying video-game battle . With her naked eye , she saw two birds of prey , one guided by mindless , mechanical technology , the other by human hands . The missile looked as if it would miss , fooled by countermeasures and some amazing evasive flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white vapor sweeping in a graceful arc . Bree stared in horror . " Razor-two , reverse left-reverse left ! " Sweat stung her eyes . " Missile in your six , closing fast . " Come on , Cam , come on . The SAM was a half-mile behind . And then a quarter-mile . Dread tightened her throat . " Harder left ! " Bree jerked , startled as smoke and debris made sudden daytime fireworks . Cam ! Ah , God . There could n't be a worse thing to witness than watching your best friend take a direct hit . In the seconds that followed , Bree searched the smoky sky , fighting the emotion that if let loose would shatter her concentration . Then she saw it , an open parachute , and it was the most beautiful sight in the world . Even better was the glimpse of Cam 's long legs dangling beneath the silk . Her wingman plunged down toward hills bordered by a U-shaped swatch of darker trees , a crescent of green in a vast sea of grey-blue conifers . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . A warning alarm trilled in her headset . She wrenched her attention back inside . Lights in the cockpit flashed at her . A stoic computer-generated voice urged : " Counter , counter . " The other missile was locked on her ! Cam 's ejection had sidetracked Bree-for only a few dozen heartbeats . But that distracted fraction of a minute might have been a fatal mistake . She gritted her teeth and hauled back on the control stick to bank away from the threat . Massive forces crammed her into her seat . Not enough . Need more . After what she saw happen to Cam , she knew it 'd take every countermeasure , everything in her bag of tricks to escape . Bree shoved the stick the opposite way and forward . Her seat belt and shoulder harnesses kept her bottom pressed firmly on the seat cushion , but negative Gs thrust her insides upward , as if she 'd just crested the highest hill on the world 's biggest rollercoaster . But her tactics were n't working . She 'd have to reverse course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle and speed would be enough to throw it off her tail . Her threat warning alarm blared . She flew wildly . Ground became sky and the sky ground . Then , a painfully intense flash of light half blinded her . For one infinitesimal slice of a tick of the clock , Bree thought that the missile had missed , and that she was watching its flamboyant suicidal finale from the front row . But when something unimaginably powerful slammed her jet from underneath and threw her forward into her shoulder harnesses , she knew better . The second missile had found its target .
