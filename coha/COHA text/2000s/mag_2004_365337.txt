Your cover line referred to Michael Phelps as a " Pool Shark " Aug. 9 . But just who is the " shark " these days ? Granted , Phelps and other members of the U.S. Olympic team are trying to focus on the Games , but with terrorists , drug scandals , injuries , journalists , coaches and p.r . machines working in overdrive , the athletes need a break . Let them concentrate on doing their best . We should n't be attempting to predetermine who will make Olympic history . Kudos to all the athletes ! DIANNA WERTHMULLER Fort Smith , Ark . <P> I was hooked when I saw your cover article on the Olympics . It is terrific to see such excellent swimmers as the U.S. 's Michael Phelps and Australia 's Ian Thorpe . I was already looking forward to the Olympics this summer , but your cover photo heightened my interest . Straight guys have their annual SPORTS ILLUSTRATED Swimsuit Edition , and this year women and gay guys have the Phelps cover . Thanks for the equal-opportunity nod . FRANCISCO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how Greece handled being host of the Olympic Games . Media reports made the situation in Athens sound dire . But at a time when the rest of the world was entering a civilized era , Greeks had already established a rich culture and accomplished better things , including the first Olympics . We Greeks are a caring people . The 2004 Games will be successful because Greeks welcome everyone from all over the world . Skeptical articles represent only a minority opinion and are not illustrative of the Greek people . GEORGE APOSTOLOPOULOS West Vancouver , B.C. <P> Swimmer Michael Phelps is a world-class athlete . He has also proved to be a world-class young adult and role model . Your article " Built for Speed " captured the essence of Phelps . Michael is a spokesman for the Boys &; Girls Clubs of America , and he volunteers his time to kids . When a gold medal is awarded for integrity and citizenship , Michael will stand on the highest platform . DONALD MATHIS , EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BOYS &; GIRLS CLUBS OF HARFORD COUNTY Aberdeen , Md . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How Bush Plans To Win " Aug. 9 , you reported that Republican National Committee operatives criticized John Kerry for including only 70 words about his 19-year Senate career in his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention . The fact that Kerry was elected to four terms indicates that Massachusetts voters feel he has represented their interests well . I eagerly await the opportunity to count how many words George W. Bush will offer on his vaunted political career . GABRIELLE S. NURRE Edgewood , N.M . <P> Kerry says he will respond appropriately to any attack by terrorists . Bush , however , has prevented destructive attacks by going after the terrorists . Responding or preventing ? The choice is easy . PETER NORSK Nivaa , Denmark
