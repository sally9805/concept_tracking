Honora Honora sets the cardboard suitcase on the slab of granite . The door is mackereled , paint-chippedgreen or black , it is hard to tell . Above the knocker , there are panes of glass , some broken and others opaque with age . Overhead is a portico of weathered shingles and beyond that a milk-and-water sky . Honora pinches the lapels of her suit together and holds her hat against the wind . She peers at the letter B carved into the knocker and thinks , This is the place where it all begins . The year is 1929 . A June day . A wedding day . Honora is just twenty , and Sexton is twenty-four . The clapboards of the house are worn from white to flesh . The screens at the windows are ripped and flapping . On the second story , dormers stand like sentries keeping watch over the sea , and from the house a thicket sharp with thorns advances across the lawn . The doorsill is splintered , and she thinks it might give way with her weight . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her not to , to wait for him . She steps down into the dooryard , her pumps denting the springy soil , unleashing a scent that collapses years . Sexton comes around the corner then , his palms upturned and filled with dirt . He is a man with a surprise , a stranger she hardly knows . A good man , she thinks . She hopes . His coat billows in the breeze , revealing suspenders snug against his shirt . His trousers , mended at a side seam , are loose and ride too low over his shoes . His hair , well oiled for the wedding , lifts in the wind . Honora steps back up onto the granite slab and waits for her husband . She puts her hands together at her waist , the purse she borrowed from her mother snug against her hip . Sexton has an offering : sandy soil , a key . " The soil is for the solid ground of marriage , " he says . " The key is for unlocking secrets . " He pauses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face toward the pillow of dirt . Two marcasite-and- pearl earrings lie nearly buried in Sexton 's hands . She brushes them off with her finger . " They belonged to my mother , " Sexton says . " The soil and the key are an old tradition your uncle Harold told me . " " Thank you , " she says . " They 're very beautiful . " She takes the key and thinks , Crossing the sill . Beginning our life together . The man came into the bank with a roll of tens and fives , wanting larger bills so that he could buy a car . He had on a long brown coat and took his hat off before he made the transaction . The white collar of his shirt was tight against his neck , and he talked to Honora as she counted out the money . A Buick two-door , he explained . A ? ? ? ? , only three years old . It was the color of a robin 's egg , he said , with a red stripe just below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navy mohair upholstery . He was getting it for a song , from a widow who 'd never learned to drive her husband 's car . He seemed excited in the way that men do when thinking about cars that do n't belong to them yet , that have n't broken down yet . Honora clipped the bills together and slipped them under the grille . His eyes were gray , set deep beneath heavy brows . He had a trim mustache , a shade darker than his hair . He brushed his hair , flattened some from the hat , from his forehead . She had to wiggle the money under the grille to remind him of it . He took it , folded it once , and slipped it into the pocket of his trousers . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " Honora , " she said . " How do you spell it ? " She spelled it for him . " The H is silent , " she added . " O-nor-a , " he said , trying it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated by the grille . It seemed an odd way to meet , though better than at McNiven 's , where she sometimes went with Ruth Shaw . There a man would slide into the booth and press his leg against your thigh before he 'd even said his name . " I 'm Sexton Beecher , " the handsome face dissected by grillwork said . At the next window , Mrs. Yates was listening intently . Honora nodded . There was a man behind him now . Harry Knox , in his overalls , holding his passbook . Growing impatient . Sexton put his hat back on . " I sell typewriters , " he said , answering a question that had n't yet been asked . " The courthouse is one of my accounts . I need a car in my job . I used to borrow my boss 's Ford , but the engine went . They said it would cost more to fix it than to buy a new one . Do n't ever buy a Ford . " It seemed unlikely she would ever buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults in town . Taft was the county seat , and all the cases went to trial there . " Enjoy the car , " Honora said . The man seemed reluctant to turn away . But there was Harry Knox stepping up to the grille , and that was that . Through the window at the side of the bank , Honora caught a glimpse of Sexton Beecher buttoning his coat as he walked away . Sexton tries the switch on the wall , even though they both know there is no electricity yet . He opens doors off the hallway so that light can enter from other rooms with windows . The floorboards of the hall are cloudy with dust , and on the walls a paper patterned in green coaches and liveried servants is peeling away at the seams . A radiator , once cream colored , is brown now , with dirt collected in the crevices . At the end of the hall is a stairway with an expansive landing halfway up , a wooden crate filled with a fabric that might once have been curtains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those in public buildings . Honora can see the mildew on the walls then , a pattern competing with the carriages and footmen . The house smells of mold and something else : other people lived here . She enters a room that seems to be a kitchen . She walks to a shuttered window and lifts the hook with her finger . The shutters open to panes of glass coated with a year or two of salt . A filmy light , like that through blocks of frosted glass , lights up an iron stove , its surface dotted with animal droppings . She twists a lever , and the oven door slams open with a screech and a bang that startle her . She bends and looks inside . Something dead and gray is in the corner . She walks around the kitchen , touching the surfaces of shelves , the grime of years in the brush strokes of the paint . A dirty sink , cavernous and porcelain , is stained with rust . She gives the tap a try . She could budge it if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still on loan from Bette 's Second Time Around . The butter yellow jacket with its long lapels narrows in nicely at the waist and makes a slender silhouette , a change from a decade of boyish dresses with no waists . She shivers in the chill and wraps her arms around herself , careful not to touch the suit with her hands . There are blankets in the car , but she can not mention them so soon . She hears footsteps on the stairs and moves into the hallway just as Sexton emerges from the cellar , wiping his hands on a handkerchief . " Found the furnace , " he says . " In the fall , we 'll have to get some coal . " She nods and gestures with her hand to the kitchen . He trails his knuckles along her arm as he passes her . " What a mess , " he says . " Not so bad , " she says , already loyal to what will be their home . In April , the typewriter salesman returned to the bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first he might be a robber . The wings of his coat spread wide around his trousers as he made his way to her station . She resisted the urge to touch her hair , which she had n't washed in days . " Want to go for a ride ? " he asked . " You bought the car . " " It 's a honey . " " I ca n't . " " When do you get off work ? " " Four o'clock . " " Banker 's hours . " The clock on the wall said half past two . The sound of a woman 's high heels could be heard on the marble floor . Sexton Beecher did n't turn around to look . " I 'll be outside at four , " he said . " I 'll give you a ride home . " I do n't even know you , she might have said , except that Mrs. Yates was leaning in Honora 's direction lest she miss a word . Honora was silent , which the man took for acquiescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really gray , but green , and that perhaps they were set too close together . His forehead was awfully high , and when he smiled , his teeth were slightly crooked . And there was something cocky in his manner , but that might just be the salesman in him , she thought . Honora laid these flaws aside as one might overlook a small stain on a beautifully embroidered tablecloth one wanted to buy , only later to discover , when it was on the table and all the guests were seated around it , that the stain had become a beacon , while the beautiful embroidery lay hidden in everybody 's laps . Sexton returns with a can of oil from the car . Honora finds a piece of castile soap wrapped in a tea towel in her suitcase . He removes his jacket and rolls his sleeves . His left forearm is already tanned from leaning it out of the window of the Buick . Honora feels a small ping in her abdomen and looks away . The tap retches and sprays a stuttering dome of brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting the water on her suit . " It 's the rust , " he says . " They said the water was turned on , but I did n't know for sure . A valve was stuck in the basement . " Together they watch the water clear . His shirt is dirty at the back . She reaches over to brush it off . He leans against the lip of the sink and bends his head , letting her touch him in this way . When she stops , he straightens . She holds out the soap and together they wash their hands in the bulbous stream of water . She scrubs the marcasite-and-pearl earrings . He watches as she puts them on . " Should I bring the picnic in , or do you want a nap ? " he asks . She feels herself blush at the word nap . " I have n't been upstairs yet , " she says . " There 's a bed . Well , a mattress . It looks clean enough . " So her husband had looked for a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are blankets in the trunk , " she says . After a time , Honora stopped thinking of him as " the typewriter salesman " and began to think of him as Sexton . He drove over from Portsmouth eight times in the three months that they courted , telling his boss that he was onto something big in Taft . He was from Ohio , he told Honora , an American heading in the wrong direction . He 'd had a year of college on the co-op program , but the freedom of traveling and the possibility of fat commissions had lured him east , away from the classroom . He made good money , he said , which might or might not be true ; she could n't be absolutely sure . Yes , there was the Buick , but she could n't ignore the too-tight collars and a sole coming loose from a shoe . The sleeves of some of his shirts were frayed at the cuffs . They courted in the Buick with all the typewriters ( Fosdick 's Nos. 6 and 7 ) , her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sexton was charming and persistent in a way Honora had never experienced before . He told her that he loved her . He also told her that he had dreams . One day there would be a Fosdick in every household , he said , and he would be the man to put them there . " Will you marry me ? " he asked her in May . On his sixth visit , Honora noticed that Sexton could hardly contain his excitement . A stroke of luck , he said in the Buick when finally they were alone . His boss knew someone who knew someone who knew someone . An abandoned house , but upright nevertheless . All they had to do , in place of rent , was take care of it and fix it up . " It 's a way to save , " he told Honora , " for a house of our own . " When they announced their engagement , no one was surprised , least of all her mother . She 'd seen it in him from the very beginning . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that so , Harold ? that this was a man who would get his appointment . Honora reaches down to touch the fabric in the carton . Faded chintz , curtains after all . And something else . A framed photograph tucked into the side of the box , as if snatched from a dresser at the last minute . A photograph of a woman and a boy . Years ago , Honora thinks , studying the dress that falls nearly to the ankle . The stairs creak some under her weight , which even with the bedding is n't much . The sound embarrasses her , as if announcing her intentions . A crystal chandelier hangs rigidly over the landing , and she sees that the ceiling of the second floor has been papered like the walls . At the top of the stairs , a sense of emptiness overwhelms her , and for the first time she feels the enormity of the tasks that lie ahead of her . Making a house liveable , she thinks . Making a marriage . It 's just the empty rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tiny chambers , a surprise after the spaciousness of the floor below . Some of the rooms are painted pale blue ; others are prettier , with printed paper on the walls . Heavy curtain rods sit naked over the windows . On the window seats are cushionsfrayed and misshapen from overuse . At the end of the hallway , she finds a suite of three rooms with a series of dormers facing the sea . In the bathroom there is a sink and a bathtub . In the bedroom she thumps a mattress with her fist , making a small cloud of dust in the salt-filtered light of the window . Why did they take the bed but not the mattress ? She tucks in the sheets , crouching at the corners , and listens for sounds of Sexton below , her heart beating so erratically that she has to put a hand to her chest . She unbuttons the yellow suit jacket , only then realizing that there are n't any hangers in the shallow closet by the door . She folds the jacket inside out and lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slips off her skirt , turning that inside out as well . She sits on the edge of the mattress in her blouse and slip , and unrolls her stockings . The kitchen was unseasonably hot and close for late June , steam rising from the iron and making droplets on her mother 's nose and brow . Her mother wore her purple cotton dress with the petunias , her low-slung weight seemingly held up only by her pinafore as she lifted the iron and set it down again on the tea cloth over the butter yellow suit . Honora sat on a chair at the kitchen table , writing labels for the canning , both of them silent , aware of change . Her mother 's hair was done up in a bun with combs and hairpins , and the stems of her glasses dug into the sides of her head . On the stove , there was the white enameled pot , the funnels and the jars , waiting to be filled with spring onions and asparagus and rhubarb jam . Even at the beginning of summer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on late into the night , as they tried to keep one step ahead of the harvest from the kitchen garden her mother kept . Honora , who hated the peeling and the preparations she was expected to do after she got home from the bank , nevertheless admired the jars with the carefully inscribed labels on the frontBeet Horseradish Relish , Asa 's Onion Pickles , Wild Strawberry Jamand the way that , later , they 'd be lined up in the root cellar , labels facing out , carrots to the north , wax beans to the south , the jars of strawberry preserves going first from the shelves . But this year her mother had cut the garden back , as if she 'd known that her daughter would be leaving home . Her uncle Harold , blind and papery , could n't walk the length of the aisle of the Methodist church and so he stood by the front pew with his niece for half a minute so as to give her away properly . She was the last child to leave the house , the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother sat in her navy polka-dot silk with the lace collar , her comfortable weight caught primly within the dress 's folds . She wore real silk stockings for the occasion , Honora noticed , and not the tan stockings from Touraine 's . Her mother 's black shoes , serviceable rather than pretty , were the ones Harold always referred to as her Sunday-go-to-meeting shoes . Her mother wore a navy cloche , the silver roll of her hair caught beneath it with mother-of-pearl combs . Just before they 'd left the house , her mother had polished her gold-rimmed glasses at the sink . She 'd taken her time at it and had pretended not to cry . " You look very pretty , " she said to Honora when she had hooked the stems of her glasses behind her ears . " Thank you , " Honora said . " You let me know , wo n't you , " her mother said . She took her hankie from inside the cuff of her dress . " About what you want me to do with the suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some women , they like to keep the clothes they get married in . I had my wedding dress with me right up until Halifax . " Honora and her mother were silent a moment , remembering Halifax . " Your father would have been so proud , " her mother said . " I know . " " So you let me know about the suit . I 'll be happy to pay for it , you decide to keep it . " Honora took a step forward and kissed her mother 's cheek . " Now , now , " her mother said . " You do n't want to set me off again . " Sexton walks into the bedroom with the picnic basket in one hand , the suitcase in the other . He looks at Honora sitting on the mattress , her stockings and her shoes and her suit folded , her garters peeking out from beneath a girdle to one side of the bed . His face loosens , as if he 'd come prepared to tell his new wife one thing but now wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the picnic basket and the cardboard suitcase . He removes his coat and lets it fall from his arms , snatching it before it hits the floor . He yanks the knot of his tie sideways . She slides backward and slips her bare legs under the cool sheet and blanket . She lays her cheek against the pillow and watches her husband with one eye . She has never seen a man undress before : the tug of the belt buckle , the pulling up of the shirttails , the shoes being kicked off , the shirt dropped to the floor , the trousersthe only garment removed with carefolded and set upon the suitcase . He unbuckles his watch and puts it on a windowsill . In the stingy light of the salted windows , she can see the broad knobs of his shoulders , the gentle muscles through the chest , the surprising gooseflesh of his buttocks , the red-gold hairs along the backs of his legs . Sexton kneels at the foot of the mattress and crawls up to his new bride . He puts his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws her to him . Her head rests on the pad of his shoulder , and her right arm is tucked between them . His knee slips between her thighs , causing the skirt of her slip to ride up to her hips . He kisses her hair . " What makes it so shiny ? " he asks . " Vinegar , " she says . " You 're shaking , " he says . " Am I ? " He presses his mouth to her shoulder . " We 'll take our time , " he says .
