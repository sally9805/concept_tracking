Section : alternatives staying centered 6 promises that will bring you closer together  --  for life <p> My beloved soul mate , Gordon , and I recently got married . You may be thinking something like , " Oh , how fabulous , love is a sweet promise , even at their age . " Or maybe you 're thinking , " Why would a woman of almost 60 want to get married again ? Is she nuts ? Gordon and I laugh about being on the longest , hottest date in history . But because of past disappointments and hurts , we 're most realistic about what it takes to make love work . This time around , we wanted to do more than exchange the lofty , traditional " love , honor , and cherish " vows . We wanted to think through the behaviors that make love a day-by-day reality and create down-to-earth vows to shape and hold our marriage together . <p> A vow is a statement of intention that 's a blueprint for action . It is n't a static statement like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specific behaviors to practice every day . Whether you 're in a relationship or not , thinking about the kind of behaviors that nurture love can help you build a better union . Though it may seem that love is an effortless grace that will last forever , sustaining it takes conscious effort . Here are examples of vows to help you put love into action . <p> " I vow to not go to bed angry " After a juicy fight , it 's tempting to hole up and nurse your grievances , or at least turn your back on your partner and fall asleep in your own little cocoon of misery . But research from the famous " Love Lab " at the University of Washington suggests that making an overture at reconciliation is a much better plan . Psychologist John Gottman , PhD , found that a couple 's ability to bridge the gap after a squabble is one of the keys to lasting relationship success . And as much as you love one another , there are bound to be times when you get miffed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so anxious when we 're at odds . How are you doing ? " can turn a disagreement around . On the other hand , if you 're really at fault , an apology is the best possible bridge between two hearts . <p> " I vow to keep our romance going  --  even when I 'm not feeling romantic " My friend Dana was stressed by the toll that motherhood was taking on her marriage . She and her husband , Allen , had been together for 10 years before their daughter was born , and they loved going out to restaurants , movies , and clubs . But when they had Stacey , their priorities shifted . Like most new parents , they were exhausted and short on funds . Allen felt abandoned because the lion 's share of Dana 's attention went to the baby . Their romance seemed dead , and he became resentful . Dana vowed to turn things around . So she started the tradition of weekly date nights , where they get a babysitter , go out as a couple , and focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , and she 's an inspiration to busy me to put aside one night a week just for Gordon . <p> " I vow to be honest " Most women lie about their feelings to placate someone else , a pattern guaranteed to breed resentment . Let 's say your partner decides to watch the Super Bowl with a buddy  --  but it 's also the night that you 're returning from an exhausting weeklong sales trip . He assumes you want to unpack ; you really want to spend the evening with him , but do n't want to be a nag . So you 're hurt and angry , and when he gets home after the game , you 're resentful and touchy instead of delighted to see him . That 's the antithesis of real love . Vowing to be honest about your feelings promotes intimacy and cuts down on resentment . <p> " I vow to stay faithful  --  even if I 'm tempted " Although you may have trouble imagining that you or your partner could succumb to a fatal attraction scenario , it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapprove of extramarital sex , carefully constructed polls estimate that 28% of married men and 17% of women have had affairs by their early 50s . It 's human nature to feel at least occasional sexual attraction to other people . Acting on those attractions , however , is where this vow comes in . The jealousy and anger that unfaithfulness breeds are the natural enemies of love and commitment . <p> " I vow to take care of myself " After Gordon and I had been married for a month , my oldest son called and started joking : " Hey , Mom , how are you guys doing ? Have you gotten fat yet ? " We 've all seen couples where one partner is buff and other looks old enough to be his or her parent . As a therapist , I 've listened to the disappointment that follows when someone is no longer attracted to a partner who has let him- or herself go physically . I 've also witnessed the sorrow when one partner falls ill or even dies of a preventable condition , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made both for myself and my husband is to take care of myself physically and emotionally so that I remain vital for as long as I can . <p> " I vow to cultivate intimacy " When Gordon asks me how I am , he 's not expecting to hear a mindless , " Fine , dear . And you ? " He really wants to understand how I 'm feeling . That 's intimacy  --  and I plan for us to stay as close as we are now for decades to come . Intimacy is a kind of mindfulness , a nonjudgmental curiosity about what 's unfolding each moment for the other person . You cultivate it by listening deeply , without trying to solve each other 's problems or butt in with your own story . Just being heard is a great antidote to stress , and it 's one of the finest gifts you can give your partner . <p> Try writing your own vows for your romantic relationship , or for a friend , a parent , a child , or a trusted coworker . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have power . Put them in a place where you can check them often . A final word : Be gentle with yourself . A vow like , " Above all , be honest , " is bound to take continual practice . Tips for building intimacy <p> Get specific about shared goals now to avoid misunderstandings later . Discuss and then agree upon 1- , 3- , and 5-year milestones for your finances , careers , and home life . Make sure they are measurable so you can track your progress . <p> Create a miniretreat with your beloved when you can be alone together , undisturbed . Write love letters to each other , being specific about when you knew you were in love and why , and what your hopes are for the future . After reading the letters , brainstorm about the vows you 'd like to make and come to an agreement about what feels right for both of you . <p> Write out your vows on a beautiful piece of paper and frame them .
