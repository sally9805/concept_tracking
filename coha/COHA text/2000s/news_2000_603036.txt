<p> Any music lover emerging from a decade on a desert island could safely assume the world is turning upside down . <p> Major pop and classical artists are switching places in ways few would have guessed in the recent past . Samuel Barber 's Adagio for Strings is a British top-five hit in a dance-mix arrangement by Madonna collaborator William Orbit . Pop artist Joe Jackson and jazz pianist Chick Corea are writing concert works that are sizable and laudable . Both the Berlin Philharmonic 's Simon Rattle and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra 's Daniel Barenboim are recording Duke Ellington . <p> It 's like a Leonard Bernstein fantasy come true . He always said the gulf between high and low art is artificial ; people should be able to write a Top 40 hit one year , a symphony the next  - -  as he did . <p> That makes perfect sense to Michael Kamen , the composer/arranger who collaborated with Metallica on the hard-rock band 's teaming with the San Francisco Symphony last year but now is composing in a more traditional mold . His first symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is being premiered and recorded Thursday through Saturday by Washington 's National Symphony Orchestra . Says Kamen , " It 's the same 12 notes . Everything else is fashion and style . " <p> However attractive the concept , it 's hardly so simple . <p> Jackson 's Symphony No. 1 ( recorded on the Sony Classical label ) initially does n't sound like a departure : The instrumentation is full of reeds , Jackson 's typical electronic keyboards , and pop rhythms and harmonies . But its form dates to Beethoven . <p> Paul McCartney 's two huge pieces , Liverpool Oratorio and Standing Stone , are a departure . Written with musical secretaries because McCartney does n't read music , those works sound little like the pop that made him famous . <p> In between are Billy Joel , whose charming , not-yet-recorded piano solo works are a refinement of his songs and return to his classical upbringing , and Elvis Costello , whose brainy rock ' n ' roll easily mutates into art songs for his latest singer of choice , Swedish opera star Anne Sofie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his album The Juliet Letters . Who knows where Orbit 's album Pieces in a Modern Style will fit ; the Feb. 8 release features dance arrangements of less-than-foot-tapping works such as Beethoven 's String Quartet Op. 132 and John Cage 's In a Landscape . <p> Kamen 's case is what golfers would call a " chip shot . " Thanks to a versatility that allowed him to collaborate with Metallica ( resulting in the best-selling recording S &M); and score the film Mr. Holland 's Opus , Kamen 's symphony was just another expression of the golden rule he learned in his student years : " Every phrase is the inevitable thing out of what came before . " <p> And having known Kamen while both were students at the Juilliard School of Music , National Symphony Orchestra music director Leonard Slatkin was enthusiastic about commissioning him . " When you have a gift , you should have as many outlets as possible , " Slatkin says . " And here you have a classically trained composer who has a lot to say . " <p> Musical crossovers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as hard , as shown by singer Luciano Pavarotti 's failed attempts to sing pop . Therefore , Rattle made a point of working with original Ellington band members , including Lena Horne , on his forthcoming release to avoid any jazz-under-glass sterility . <p> That 's also why Barenboim breathes an extra sigh of relief when complimented on his new disc , Tribute to Ellington . Though his interest in jazz grew out of a familiarity with tango in his native Argentina , Barenboim really does n't improvise : " I 'm not a jazz pianist . I do n't pretend to be one . I play it in a way that I can make a tribute to Ellington . " <p> Both directions in this musical crisscrossing are driven by a common factor : classical recording operations . While classical standard-repertoire sales have fallen off , classical artists maintain visibility by challenging their boundaries . Rattle recently recorded the Bernstein Broadway show Wonderful Town . Russian violinist Gidon Kremer has become a major exponent of tango . <p> The labels also welcome more ambitious projects by pop artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales expectations and pressure for a hit single exerted by pop labels . And if they want an orchestra , classical labels know right where to find one . Jackson could n't be happier with Sony Classical : " I do n't care if it 's called Sony Bluegrass  --  if they 're the people who want to work with me , that 's who I want to be with . " <p> At the same time that today 's pop-to-classical crossover artists are evidencing more ambition than the rock bands of days past ( Moody Blues , Procol Harum , Deep Purple ) that used an orchestra as a mere backdrop , the idea of classical music itself is being revised . It can be newer , more immediate and punchier , which is the philosophy of Sony Classical president Peter Gelb , the unofficial godfather of this movement . <p> Gelb , who has urged Titanic film composer James Horner to write concert works , also persuaded concert composer John Corigliano to write film music for The Red Violin , which is nominated for a Grammy . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gelb says , " but we get music written and composed . " <p> EMI does n't just encourage McCartney 's classical efforts  --  it commissions them . " That Paul moves from songs into larger forms is not so different from what songwriters did in the past , " says EMI-Angel general manager Gilbert Hetherwick . " At this point in his life , he keeps pushing himself forward . " <p> But all manner of artistic adjustments must be made . In writing his symphony , Kamen missed the abandon of rock ' n ' roll , which he experienced in his student days as founder of the New York Rock ' n ' Roll Ensemble . He also had to clear his schedule : The symphony took an entire year . That kind of time commitment is why jazz/classical crossover figure Bobby McFerrin opted not to write a full-length work for the San Francisco Opera , even though he was offered librettos by Angels in America playwright Tony Kushner . <p> Better that than overstepping artistic bounds . Both Romulus Hunt , a children 's opera by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart Copeland , former drummer for The Police , were widely regarded as major embarrassments . <p> Jackson was painfully aware of that potential in writing his symphony ; his decision to write it came slowly : " It has a lot to do with not comparing myself to anyone else . If there 's a reason it took so long to do it , I was scared to be in competition with the giants of music . At some point , I said to myself that I 'm entitled . " <p> With such genre-blurring comes marketing problems . The audience crosses many age , economic and geographic boundaries ; finding it can require advertising budgets that devour profits . That 's why Hetherwick has become leery of one-off projects by label-hopping artists ; those who create a body of work can create long-term momentum . <p> The other problem is that stores refuse to stock a given release in more places than one . Does Barenboim 's Ellington belong in the jazz section , where prospective buyers know Ellington but not Barenboim ? Will Kamen 's symphony , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section , where people know his name ? <p> Both discs are more likely to be found in the classical section , which could limit their discovery by a fringe , impulse-buying audience . Internet buying helps solve such problems , Gelb says . But Kamen , for instance , still will have to settle for a fraction of his usual exposure . <p> He is n't overly perturbed : " It may be that Bach only reached 100 people in the church where he first played his cantatas , but every day I play a little bit of Bach on piano , and hundreds of thousands of others have had pleasure from those works . There 's a longer shelf life in making compositions that are n't songs . "
