<p> FOREIGN POLICY : Leave analyses to true experts <p> My wife and I found it rather strange that the Constitution would devote so much space to a column about United States-China relations from an unauthoritative source ( " Antagonizing Chinese is wrong route in U.S. policy , " Viewpoints , May 10 ) . It never ceases to amaze us how Americans can make a two-day trip to some place like China and suddenly feel an urge to enlighten the rest of us about their new found discovery . <p> Just because a place is new to the sometimes traveler does not make it new at all to the hundreds of Americans who either live overseas , or are engaged in rigorous study of a particular region and culture . This is n't even counting the thousands of immigrants to the United States from both China and Taiwan who have a much better grasp of the issues than what short visit provides . <p> Please leave the geopolitical analysis to experts and avoid such a shallow rendition of an extraordinary complicated issue . Whether one agrees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no easy solutions . CHARLES and HAE-OAK KELLY , Atlanta <p> U.S. policy should go beyond commerce <p> I enjoyed reading Paul McKeon 's views on China ( " Antagonizing Chinese is wrong route in U. S. policy , " Viewpoints , May 10 ) , but I would suggest he think just a little bigger than being able to cultivate a new market for our goods and services . This is not purely a matter of business and commerce but is also about human rights and national security . <p> The U.S. plane was in international airspace when China 's plane provoked and then collided into our plane . Are we to back down from that provocation just so we can enjoy a photo-op partnership built on the shaky foundation left by the Clinton administration ? George W. Bush is smart enough to know that he must deal from a position of strength . Before he can build a strong relationship with the world 's second most powerful country , he must first erase the embarrassment of the previous administration . <p> This complex situation should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McKeon would take the long view , backward and forward , he may conclude that the current U.S. administration is playing it exactly right . MICHAEL B. FLEMING , Dunwoody <p> ' THE WIND DONE GONE ' : Countersuit should be filed <p> I could not let the five negative opinions out of six regarding Alice Randall 's " The Wind Done Gone , " go by without comment . <p> I am a middle-aged black man from the South who has read all but 30 pages of Randall 's book , and I believed the Mitchell Trusts Committee should be countersued for censorship . " TWDG " is a pleasant , sometimes humorous , and mostly a delightful and insightful observation from the experiences of a black women . <p> I can relate to the stories in the book to my family history in Tennessee from my mother 's side and South Carolina from my father 's side . I believe the Mitchell Trusts stirred up the controversy , not Alice Randall . <p> I think that people are confusing Randall 's anger with the Mitchell Trusts ' attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to gets a chance to read the book . The book does not read in anger , or hate , as some have derived from reading her column . PHILIP McCOLLUM , East Point <p> Myth of ' GWTW ' belongs to people ; publish response <p> It is an ill wind that blows no good . <p> If , as Alice Randall says , Butterfly McQueen 's performance in " GWTW " helped fuel the justifiable rage of Malcolm X , we owe her more than we thought we did . <p> That said , the Mitchell Trusts should realize that once a story becomes a myth , it ceases to belong to any person , family , race , or region . " GWTW " is  --  for better or worse  --  a part of us all . " The Wind Done Gone " should be published . Alice Randall 's response to the myth deserves a hearing . ELIZABETH KRAFT , Athens <p> MOLLY IVINS : Columnist provides insightful pieces <p> I must respond to a letter calling Molly Ivins ' column " stupid " ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 ) . I challenge anyone to provide us with an example of any columnist , liberal or conservative , who has a complete grasp of facts based on research and backed up by direct quotation as does Molly Ivins . As a Texan , Molly supplies us with direct insight into a host of real characters from the Lone Star state such as " Hot Tub " Tom Delay , Phil " My Mama " Gramm and George " Do they have Bibles " Dubya Bush . <p> I look forward to Wednesdays , when her column appears . She never fails to lift my spirits with her incisive wit and knowledge of our pitiful political system . STEVE AUSTIN , Acworth <p> Thanks for running comforting op-eds <p> I want to thank you so much for running Molly Ivins ' columns . She is a shining ray of light that comforts me in the midst of all the hate-filled , right-wing rhetoric that often dominates the Constitution op-ed pages , courtesy of Mona Charen and Maggie Gallagher . I have to cheer every time an anti-Molly letter is printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NORMAN HUNTER , Norcross <p> Disturbing lawsuit <p> The American Civil Liberties Union 's lawsuit against the school that chose to ban the Rebel flag T-shirts is most disturbing . I find it appalling that groups are still trying to send the message that the old Rebel battle flag is not about hatred but rather about heritage . <p> Schools have the right to ban gang-related shirts and activity because it makes certain group uncomfortable . Why should n't they be allowed to ban an item that has as many bad connotations as the Rebel flag ? School should be a place of tolerance and multiculturalism , and students have a right to feel safe in their learning environment . That means that sometimes when should make concessions , even if it is for the minority of the school population . JOSHUA L. TROUP , Fitzgerald <p> Dig at homemakers was detestable <p> An otherwise engaging article about a doctor commuting from Iowa to Georgia for an MBA was marred by her defensive stance that less time for her seven children was justified because they " got to see me study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( " Kennesaw MBA grad deserves extra credit , " May 11 ) . <p> This blatant dig at stay-at-home mothers ended my cheering for this ambitious woman . Is n't this the time of year when we acknowledge that all mothers do things we do n't want to do and make sacrifices ? Is n't that why all of us , doctors and bakers alike , deserve the burnt toast and bud vase on Mother 's Day morning ? <p> Are we still this massively insecure about our choices ? That 's the role modeling for our children that worries me . ANDREA SARVADY , Atlanta <p> U.S. need not apologize for looking out for No. 1 <p> Regarding the column on United States world power ( " U.S. position as world power suffers because of Bush 's unilateral moves , " Viewpoints , May 11 ) : What U.S. prestige is this woman talking about after the last eight years  --  eight years of foreign policy of political expediency manifested by the indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians to distract the world 's attention from Bubba 's sex scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its affairs in the interests of its own citizens . <p> I am grateful that we once again have a president who understands this . LLOYD KROHN , Lawrenceville <p> HOUSE OF PRAYER : Parents have right to discipline their kids <p> I support the parents who have dared to flout the state 's authority and continue to punish their children as they see fit . <p> It 's about time that people stood up to the storm trooper tactics of the Department of Family and Children 's Services and exposed them for what they are . They have no business being involved in this case because they do n't approve of Reverend Arthur Allen 's message about corporal punishment . BEN BRYANT , Decatur <p> Were children told to attack officers ? <p> The Constitution editorial concerning the confrontation with the House of Prayer was dead on ( " Tactics in seizing kids challenged , " May 10 ) . <p> I watched the homemade video on the news , and I admired the restraint of the female police officer . The children were biting and kicking , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone tells a child to strike a police officer , then that person should be in jail .
