He was n't always a great magician . Sometimes he said he was the seventh magician in his family , the **32;777;TOOLONG of Celtic sorcerers . Sometimes he claimed years of training at the feet of Oriental wizards . But his press releases never told the truth , that from the moment Charles Carter the Fourth first learned it , magic was not an amusement , but a means of survival . All magicians had boyhood stories . Kellar , Houdini , Thurston , and many of the best found inspiration during periods of illness and bed rest , when a relative would bring them a magic set to while away their days . But not Carter . Instead , his first performance took place in a deserted house in the dead of winter , when he was nine years old . At first , the house was full . He grew up in San Francisco , Pacific Heights , specifically Presidio Heights , 3638 Washington Street between Spruce and Locust . This was a three-story Italianate built in 1874 to house the Russian consulate . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer pay the mortgage . Mr. and Mrs. Charles Carter III , newlyweds , moved in . On the ground floor was the foyer , then the parlor and the drawing room , with chairs and tables from Gump 's and window boxes around the fireplace where the ladies sat for tea in winter . The grand piano was in the parlor , and there Charles was forced to sit upright twice a week , pecking note by note through " Twinkle Twinkle Little Star " and other tunes from Instructive Melodies , the worn cloth songbook his humorless teacher pointed to with bony fingers . Running from the parlor to the back dining room were forty-five feet of freedom , in the form of a hallway with rugs that always slipped , and when they were being cleaned , Charles tiptoed from room to room , looking for every adult  --  mother , father , nurse , cook , valet , maids  --  and if all of them were upstairs , he kicked off his shoes and skidded down the floors in his stocking feet . Then he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , younger than Charles and devoted as a duckling , never instigated , and was brilliant at behaving innocently when called upon . They never pushed their luck . Just two or three transits down the floorboards , enough to find exactly the right posture to carry them farthest and fastest  --  they were racehorses , freight trains , comets  --  then Charles would crouch in the breakfast nook , retying his shoelaces , and James 's , and putting on his sweetest face to ask Cook for a glass of milk . The house was paid for , as were most houses in Pacific Heights , on the trading of stocks , bonds , and notes . Their father was an investment banker , and better than most in his character and intuition , riding out the occasional panic and run on gold with good humor . Further , Mr. Carter was blessed with a hobby to which he could apply his imagination : he collected . When it was fashionable to collect European artwork , he did so , and when fashions shifted to Japan , the Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  scrolls mounted behind glass that showed the cast of Genji Monogatari . Though the Japan mania caused many of the Pacific Heights social set to fill room after room with woodcuts of every single one of the 53 Stages of the Tokaido , Mr. Carter believed that to have three of anything was a collection . Then it was time to move on . Charles 's mother , Lillian , was a complexity : she had grown up in a house of New England Transcendentalists and passionately pursued the riches of interior life . A robust woman who could argue the politics of suffrage for three hours straight , Mrs. Carter also suffered fainting spells , allergies , and the overaccumulation of nervous energy . In one year , she received a neurologist , who said she had a depletion of phosphorous so that her nerve cells conducted electricity improperly ; a somatic hygienist , who prescribed bed rest to replenish nutritional energies lost to excessive thinking and feeling ; a psychoanalyst , who wanted to explore her girlhood conflicts with her parents ; a hypnotist , who put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit medium , who led a sance to rid her of abnormal spirit clusters . " I have many , many neuroses , " she declared at a parlor room tea to which Charles and James had been invited as long as they were quiet . " I have them , too , " said Mrs. Owens , who was competitive . " But I 've been invited to Boston for a study , " Mrs. Carter said , which defeated Mrs. Owens and caused many of Mrs. Carter 's other friends to ask questions : was she following the theosophists ? Or a more traditional field ? Mrs. Carter was in fact to be a patient of Dr. James Jackson Putnam , a psychoanalyst and Harvard professor . " He recommended this book , " she explained , displaying with pride her inscribed copy of Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders . " Oh , psychic treatment , " Mrs. Owens said . " That was popular ... several years ago . " Her lip curled with sympathy . " No , no , this is quite new . Honestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's ... " Mr. Carter met his wife 's eye and he charted another course . " It ca n't be dismissed . " Charles , almost nine years old , followed the conversation with an interest that deepened as he realized his mother was considering a trip to Boston . How long would she be away ? Could he go with her ? He glanced at James , who was just six years old , and who turned the pages of a stiff-backed Famous Men and Famous Deeds , humming quietly to himself . He almost whispered , " James , pay attention , " but he did n't want to be dismissed from the room . The topic was abandoned , but Charles listened for the rest of the afternoon for clues : was his mother actually going away ? A few nights later , she sat at the end of his bed and explained that he and his brother would n't be left alone : there was his father , and Frulein Reinhardt , and of course the rest of the servants . " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " James will look to you for guidance . You ca n't let him down . " Charles watched her twist her necklace between her fingers . " He 's so young he 'll wonder why he ca n't come with me . " Charles considered , then , a different question to ask her . " When are you coming back ? " " That 's a tremendous question , Charles . There are circles within circles . In fact , Dr. Putnam compares the experience to the Divine Comedy . You know . " His mother nodded at him , and he nodded back , to show he understood . At bedtime , she had a habit of talking as if they were allies sharing a confidence . " First , you descend into your emotional life with a doctor as your guide , and then the repressed memories are washed away in the Lethe . " When she spoke  --  she was adept at speaking and annoyed at those who merely talked  --  his mother drew on many dramatic gestures whose source Charles could hardly guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her progress through psychoanalysis , she flamboyantly waved her fingers and winced as if in pain . " You pass the moaning souls in the lake of fire , but you must push on past that despair "  --  she displayed a faraway gaze of contemplation  --  " till you come to "  --  with a sigh of release  --  " inner resourcefulness . " Charles followed the gestures and the sound of her voice , but little else . She was going to have an adventure , and when she came back , she would be more experienced and in better mental health . But there was no way to know how long it would take . His last sight of her that night was in the doorway , her hand on the wall as she dimmed the light , her face illuminated by the dying orange cast of the gas jet . Lillian Carter knew how to leave a room with a flourish , and Charles loved the pauses before she left . She whispered , eyebrows arching , " The next time we see each other , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers to her lips as if she 'd just told him a secret . As she closed the door , slowly , stepping backward into the hall , Charles memorized the look of promise on her half-shadowed face , the way she anticipated a great mystery . It would be his last sight of her for two years .
