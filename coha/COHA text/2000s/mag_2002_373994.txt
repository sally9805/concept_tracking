Their hairdos were lacquered helmets seemingly designed to crush thoughts about anything more complicated than the cheese dip 's texture . Their faces were masks , the makeup preventing any expression broader than a polite smile . Their bodies were encased in push-up bras and grasping girdles , choking any hint of untoward sexual expression . <P> These were the ladies who lunched in Douglas Sirk 's 1950s " women 's pictures " ( magnificent obsession , all that heaven allows , imitation of life ) . Universal Studios decreed the improbable luxe of their suburban decor and the oversaturated colors of the films ' palette . reviewers of the time dismissed these films ( though audiences lapped them up ) , but over the years academics , feminist theorists and the ga-ga cinephile community have insisted on a re-evaluation . They see in Sirk 's films ' sympathy for his painfully repressed heroines a slyly subversive assault on the bland values that strangled them . <P> This imputes to the European-born director an intention not entirely supported by his work . But writer-director Todd Haynes , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passionate homage to Sirk , makes the best possible case for him . Haynes encountered sirk when he was studying film at brown university and soon enough  --  possibly because haynes is a gay man , all too familiar with bourgeois hostility to sexual nonconformity  --  became hooked . " Sirk was trying to approach these Ladies Home Journal properties with a kind of critical distance , " says Haynes , " critiquing dominant American cultures and a sort of claustrophobia that basically trapped these characters . " He also observes that Sirk 's pictures were different from women 's pictures of the ' 30s and ' 40s , which depicted their leading women as spunky , often successful rebels against the status quo . Sirk 's heroines " were actually very ordinary , fragile . If anything , they buckle under pressure in the end . " <P> All of which is true and sounds more like a critical historical thesis than the edgy , absorbing movie Haynes has made . He is able to raise the melodramatic stakes . Yes , his Cathy ( Julianne Moore ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way Jane Wyman once was to Rock Hudson . But he is now a black man , thus infinitely more threatening to suburban comity . Her husband ( Dennis Quaid ) is a workaholic , as emotionally absent as any Sirk hero . But he is also coming to belated terms with his long-closeted homosexuality . Haynes is opening issues here that ' 50s movies could only hint at . <P> And unlike Sirk , he has actors who can play a fuller emotional range than the stiffish likes of Lana Turner and Rock Hudson . Quaid makes a decent man 's anguish richly palpable . Moore makes us feel hidden frenzy with a cool and ultimately heartbreaking grace . As a result , Far from Heaven ironizes without parodying an antique screen manner , then reaches out from beneath this smooth cover to grab us . It 's the Sirk movie  --  fully alert to all his shadowy implications  --  that Sirk may or may not have intended but never actually made .                 @ @ @ @
