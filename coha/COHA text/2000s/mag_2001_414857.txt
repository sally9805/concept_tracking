There 's a secret to getting off the to-do list treadmill . And it does n't involve multitasking. // I 'm sitting on my hands , but they 're twitching hard . The head Scout honcho has just asked for a volunteer , and it 's taking all I 've got to keep my hand from shooting up and to resist the temptation to shout " I 'll do it ! " She needs someone to spend a gazillion hours in special outdoor training and then to spend a gazillion more hours training others in the same . I do n't want this job . It 's not even remotely interesting to me . I 'm already a Brownie leader , a Teen Canteen chaperone , an occasional " art mom " at school , and a " soccer snack mom " on weekends ; plus I have a freelance job and two kids . I do not need any more drags on what little time I have to myself . So why , then , do my hands keep twitching ? Sigh .... Women who do too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 're Energizer bunnies .... You would think we 'd have permanently retired these cliches by now . But somehow I still find myself packing my days so tightly that I sometimes forget to breathe . And I know I 'm not the only one . Look around and I guarantee you 'll see a woman who cut back on work because she felt she never had time for herself , and who then jammed her new " free " time with so many volunteer activities that she 's more beat than before . Or you 'll see one who , the minute she finishes decorating one house , has to move and start the whole time  --  draining , energy-sucking process all over again . And in just about any home across America , you 'll hear these words echoing as children clamor in the background : " In a minute , honey , in a minute . Just let Mommy finish doing ... " whatever . It 's weird , this drive to keep busy . Because even as we add activities to our to-do lists , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even bored and vaguely dissatisfied . Given that we say one thing but then do another-do the complete opposite , in fact-it 's enough to make you wonder : Are we afraid not to be busy ? Photograph Ease up and you may worry , " Will it all tall apart ? " // WHAT ARE WE RUNNING AWAY FROM ? A strong work ethic , a highly developed sense of moral responsibility and civic duty , and an average drive for financial and career success can make it seem normal and right to fill your day with productivity , contribution , efficiency , leadership , and charity . You may even feel proud of your can-do reputation ( ergo the hand twitching at the Scout meeting ) . But the striving to live up to these honorable principles can eclipse your equally valid need to relax , rest , contemplate , enjoy , breathe  --  especially if you were raised to believe that idle time is wasted time . " I 'm afraid if I 'm not productive , that means I 'm worthless , " says Lisa Haas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though I know that 's not true , the fear comes from the belief system I grew up with . " At her worst , Haas held a full-time job in financial services and another job , before and after the workday , as a personal fitness trainer . " I did n't leave any room for myself , " she recalls . " If someone asked me to go out to dinner , I 'd stay busy until five minutes beforehand so that every minute was taken  --  I had it down to a science . And I was totally exhausted . " When you 're conditioned to value only activity that ends in results , you come to believe that either you 're doing  --  or you 're dead . Try to ease up even for a day and you suffer from the whiplash of subliminal messages : You 're lazy . You 're not contributing . Or if you 're competitive , You 're going to lose out . No wonder it 's scary ! " I was afraid of getting comfortable with not doing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there , I 'd never come out . " Cramming your days with nonstop activity is also an efficient way to distract yourself from uncomfortable situations and feelings : Maybe you 're questioning your marriage or a friendship ; maybe you 're unhappy in your job . At best , activity fills the time until you 're ready to deal ; at worst it can be a form of denial or escapism . Ironically , it can also keep you from wondering about what you might really love to do , because you never pause long enough to ask yourself the difficult questions : Do you want to learn to paint ? Train for a marathon ? Learn Italian ? Try to write poetry ? Pick up the piano lessons you quit at 13 ? Often we stay busy simply to avoid the hard and lonely task of directing our life with conscious intent . We indulge in the soothing rhythms of a dutiful existence rather than face the responsibility of choosing our life 's direction , for that might require courage , change , and action as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE BRAKES No matter what compels you to stay busy , the solution is the same : You need to give yourself permission to slow down . No one is going to do this for you . The rest of the world probably wants you to keep going , because the more you take on , the less they have to do . ( It took me a while to understand that my drive to do good did n't make me more honorable than the other women at that Scout meeting . It just made me a sucker . They already knew if they kept silent long enough , someone else would eventually raise her hand . ) Make no mistake , though : Giving yourself permission to not do does n't come without pangs of guilt and anxiety . When Kathy Crowley , 39 , an assistant professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine , finished her residency in 1995 , she was so used to working 90 hours a week that she continued to pack her days-with work , exercise , travel , fiction writing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a lot of things done at once , so when time became available , my initial reaction was to feel at loose ends ; I had to fight the tendency to fill it with activity , " she says . " Eventually I tried to do things that were aimed at consciously slowing down , like sitting with a cup of tea , but that felt really silly at first . " When her first child was born three years ago , Crowley cut back on her 60-hour work  --  week to spend time with her daughter and to squeeze in the writing she loves . " Then a year ago I realized I wanted still more time for myself , and that 's when I asked to cut down to 20 hours a week-which is not something people do in my department . But they did n't want to lose me , " she says . " I 'm very protective about the time I 've gained . On Tuesdays now , I spend the morning writing , but I leave the afternoon open for whatever I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she 'd like because of financial reasons , and any free time she has is with her kids . When I talk to her , I feel guilty that I have time with my kids and I have this as my time ; but I also figure a happy mom is a better mom . " Although you may want-and need - to trade some of your time-consuming obligations for more fulfilling passions , it sometimes takes even more courage to let commitments go without planning something to replace them . As scary as it may be to stop doing and just be , whatever anxiety you initially experience will give way to extreme pleasure as you discover you 're not being lazy : You 're feeding your soul . It is , after all , in the empty space of silence and inactivity that inspiration , creativity , insight , and inner direction are born , for they need stillness to be heard ; not one of them lives in a crowded land . Haas 's epiphany arrived with the end of a long-term live-in relationship , when she hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn more about herself . " Because of the way I 'd been going , I could n't tell you anymore what I liked , what I felt , " she recalls . " How could I when my mind was on something outside of myself for 18 hours a day ? " Eventually she decided to let go of her personal training business and to focus on her finance job . " I felt like I was letting my clients down , but it was also a relief , " she says . " I started feeling less stress and pressure , and finally began to enjoy life . " HOW TO STEAL MORE TIME Personal worth is n't measured in output but in the beauty of your presence , plain and simple ; so start giving yourself bits of time-to do what you want , or nothing at all . If you saw one of your kids running too fast , you 'd say , " Honey , slow down , " so why not treat yourself with the same care ? " One of the keys to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm beginning to trust that I may kick back today but tomorrow I 'll kick it into gear , and that I do n't need to force things to happen now to be successful , or to do a million things to be happy . " Some women trick themselves into chilling out by getting lost in a good book or by spending unstructured time with friends . Scheduling breaks during the day-for a bike ride , to read the paper , to listen to a CD  --  can also help remind you not to pack the minutes back-to  --  back . You know that daily to-do list ? Scratch off the bottom third ; you never get to it anyway , and it 's just a guiltmonger . If , like me , you have a weakness for others ' requests ( especially when caught off guard on the phone ) , practice saying " No , thanks " and " I 'll get back to you about that . " Basically , though , what you need is a mantra , so that when you 're tempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have trained yourself to use one , such as " I deserve this ; I deserve this time . " My favorite comes from a friend who reduced her work hours and took a pay cut so she 'd have time to write poetry . The way she gives herself permission is to tell herself " I paid for this time . It 's mine . " Tell yourself the same , because in one way or another you have paid for it . So learn to be still in the quiet where dreams are born , and if one happens to whisper to you , do what you must to protect it-even if that means sitting on your hands . <p>
