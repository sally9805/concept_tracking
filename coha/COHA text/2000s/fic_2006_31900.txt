The Catch She wished something would happen . She wished it while she was looking at a magazine . The magazine was her sister Chrisanne 's ; so was the bed she was sitting on and the sweater Debbie had decided to borrow after coming into Chrisanne 's room to use her lip gloss . Chrisanne was n't there . She had gone off somewhere . Thinking she should be more specific in case her wish came true , even though it was n't an official wish , it was just a thought , Debbie thought , I wish something different would happen . Something good . To me . As she thought it , she wound her finger in the necklace she was wearing , which was her own , then unwound it again . It was a short necklace , and she could only wrap her finger in it twice . At least while it was still around her neck . The article she was looking at was about how the most important thing was to be yourself . Although the pictures that went with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seem like you could do both at the same time . Debbie checked her wish for loopholes , because of all those stories about wishes that come true but cause disasters at the same time . Like King Midas turning his daughter and all of his food into gold . Even in her own life , Debbie remembered that once , when she was little , she had shouted that she wished everyone would just leave her alone . And then everyone did . The trouble with being too careful about your wishes , though , was that you could end up with a wish so shapeless that it could come true and you would n't even know it , or it would n't matter . She wrapped the necklace around her finger again , and this time it popped loose , flinging itself from her neck onto a bright , fuzzy photograph of a boy and a girl , laughing , having fun against a backdrop of sparkling water . Debbie picked up her necklace and jiggled the catch . It stuck sometimes in a partly open position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , she thought , looking at the photo . Wondering if it would require being a different person . In a way that does n't hurt anyone or cause any natural disasters , she added , out of habit . Fastening the chain back around her neck , trying to tell by feel whether the catch had closed , she thought of another loophole . Hoping it was n't too late to tack on one more condition , she thought the word soon . The wish floated off , and she turned the page . Meanwhile , in another part of town , Hector 's sister , Rowanne , was upstairs in her bedroom , changing her clothes or something . Hector could hear her humming , and the sound of drawers opening and closing . He was crossing the front hall on his way to the kitchen and , as he passed the mirror , he glanced in and gave himself a little smile . It was something he always did ; he did n't know why . For encouragement , maybe . This time he smiled hello at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the diamond-shaped windows in the front door at the side of his face , producing a sort of side-lit , golden , disembodied-head effect in the mirror . It struck him as an improvement on the usual averageness of his face ; it added some drama . Some intrigue . An aura of inter-estingness his sister 's face had all the time , but his did not , which mystified him because when he compared their features one at a time , a lot of them seemed identical . Or almost identical . There were some small differences . Like their hair . Their hair was different . They both had auburn hair , but while Rowanne 's auburn hair plummeted in a serene , graceful waterfall to her waist , Hector 's shot out from his head in wiry , dissenting clumps . And while both of their faces were slim , freckled ovals with a hint of roundness , Hector 's was rounder . Rowanne had slipped away from her roly-poly childhood like a sylph from a cocoon , but Hector 's was still wrapped around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-gray , behind almost identical wire-rimmed glasses resting on very similar slender noses . But Rowanne 's eyes-glasses-nose constellation somehow conveyed intelligence and warmth . Hector 's conveyed friendly and goofy . Why ? What was the difference ? Maybe it was his eyes , he was thinking . Maybe they were too close together . Maybe they would move farther apart as he matured , like a flounder 's . Although when he thought about it , he seemed to remember that both the flounder 's eyes ended up on the same side of its face . He tried to remember what made that happen , if it was something the flounder did , and if maybe he could do the opposite . Perhaps it would help that he was n't lying on the bottom of the ocean watching for food to float by . He definitely felt unfinished , still in process . He felt that there was still time , that by the time three years had passed and he was seventeen , as Rowanne was now , he , too , might coalesce into something . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible , he felt . Hector took off his glasses to see if his eyes looked better without them . He looked blurrier , which seemed to heighten the cinematic , enigmatic quality lent by the falling sun 's sideways glance . His clumpy hair dissolved softly into the shadows , and the effort he had to make to see gave an intense , piercing quality to his gaze . Maybe corrected vision was n't all it was cracked up to be . Maybe in ancient times , when distinct edges were unknown to many people , he would have been considered handsome . Though he might have had a lot of headaches . The sun dropped a degree and the golden disembodied moment passed . Hector put his glasses back on and was about to turn away when a sharp jab of weight on his shoulder made him jump . It was Rowanne 's chin . She had sneaked up behind him , and her face appeared next to his in the mirror . So much like his , but more . There was just no explaining it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
