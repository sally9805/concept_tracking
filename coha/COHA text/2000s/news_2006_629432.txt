<p> Tracy McGrady has not heard a word . Jerry Colangelo , Phoenix Suns chairman and managing director of the USA Basketball senior national team , has not called or sent out feelers . He has not invited McGrady to be part of the U.S. team at the World Championships this summer in Japan or in the Beijing Olympics in 2008 . <p> But McGrady is not offended . He would seem a natural candidate , widely considered among the best American players , versatile enough for the style of play needed and a strong enough passer to fit on such a loaded team . <p> It seems odd that there has not been a word in his direction . But something keeps McGrady from feeling snubbed ; he does n't want to go . <p> McGrady said he would like to play internationally again under difference circumstances . He played in the USA Basketball Olympic qualifying team in 2003 but backed out of the Athens Olympics because of security concerns . <p> But with Colangelo seeking continuity for the next team sent to the Olympics , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2003 team was thought to be sticking together for 2004 , Colangelo is asking players to commit for the World Championships , then either a qualifying tournament or a series of exhibitions in 2007 before heading to the Olympics in 2008 . <p> McGrady , with his back flaring up this season amid briefer tweaks of his right ankle and right knee , was not ready to pledge to play that long - if he were to be asked . <p> " Right now , at this point in my career , because of the commitment , I wo n't be able to do that , " he said . " I would like to , without a doubt . I do n't think my body would be able to hold up going through playing a full 82 games , possibly playoffs and then summer ball . " <p> McGrady said he has " no feelings " about not hearing from Colangelo . He still might . But he did n't think his decision to skip Athens has been held against him . <p> " It was just a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , " McGrady said . " I 'm sure they understand that . <p> " I just did n't feel comfortable at the time . I just had my little girl and I did n't feel comfortable bringing her over there or being away from her . I definitely do n't think they 're holding a grudge against me for that , without a doubt . " <p> If he is contacted , he might have to consider it again . Colangelo , rightfully , is not recruiting so much as selecting a team . But the chance to play might make the option more appealing . <p> Games of the week <p> Rockets - Tonight , vs . Denver . It 's a close call , but the Rockets ' worst performance this season could be their Dec. 23 bomb in Denver . Dreadful at home this season , and coming off a bad loss in Toronto to another team that had recently humbled them , tonight 's game could set the tone for a full week to come . <p> NBA - Thursday , Detroit at San Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last season 's Finals . The Spurs have been much better since and have " Manu Ginobili " back for the meeting of the class of the league . <p> A Weiss man once said <p> A case could be made Bob Weiss did n't get much of a chance . But before the Sonics gave up on him last week , he seemed to know it was n't going to work , effectively telling his boss he did n't know how to turn around Seattle 's slump , or did n't want more than the two-month chance he got . <p> The Sonics began a five-game road trip by falling behind the Pacers by 20 in the first quarter and never making it a game . <p> " You could see it , " GM Rick Sund said . " And Bobby said , Rick , I am at wits ' end to find what I can do to get this team consistent . ' We kind of reached the point where a change needed to be made . " <p> The Sonics hired Weiss because he is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to elevate the assistant that would help keep Ray Allen . With the Sonics slumping , they fired Weiss because he is such a good guy . They elevated Bob Hill , who wo n't have that problem . <p> Now that 's just gangster <p> Sonics forward Danny Fortson , suspended for two games for cursing referee Sean Corbin , lashed into NBA vice president Stu Jackson in a long , disjointed tirade . <p> " What Stu Jackson did is criminal , as far as I 'm concerned , " Fortson said . " It 's like a gangster , somebody just strong-arming somebody and taking their money . That is a gangster move . Gangster . That is gangsterism . <p> " I am not going to let Stu Jackson gangster me out of money for something that was n't even properly investigated . I do n't know what I am going to do yet , but I am going to do something , I am not going to sit there and let him strong-arm me . " <p> Fortson , by the way , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjective describing the call , adding that Corbin lied in his report to the league and Jackson , gangster that he apparently is , did not investigate . <p> " Just because he is Stu Jackson and all that , maybe I am supposed to be scared and not speak my mind , " Fortson said . " But if I see something that is wrong , and I feel wronged , I am going to speak my mind . As simple as that . <p> " If you are going to be in that type of position , you better even things out . All men are created equal . In the United States , you are equal . Is the NBA a communist bloc ? Or is this an equal democracy ? He needs to figure that one out . And if he does n't , I 'm going to make it a democracy . " <p> Statistician 's Dream ' <p> Andrei Kirilenko , who struggled through the start of the season when he thought he might enjoy being a scorer , is back to being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a statistical measurement just for him , the 5x5 . <p> Apparently , just nine guys have reached five or more in the five positive statistical categories . Only Kirilenko and Hakeem Olajuwon , who it turns out was a 5x5 machine , have done it more than once . ( Imagine how great we would have thought Olajuwon was if we knew he had nine career 5x5s . ) <p> Anyway , Kirilenko scored 14 points against the Lakers and dominated the game , also getting eight rebounds , nine assists , six steals and seven blocks . <p> Only he and Olajuwon have gone for a 6x6 . ( Someone stop me . ) <p> " Well , he was playing pingpong out there , volleyball or something , " Lakers coach Phil Jackson said . " I thought he was playing the wrong sport for a while . It looked like our guys were setting him up for ( spikes ) . Some of our guys were just putting it up on a tee or something . " <p> Nice move , Isiah <p> Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . So last week , they did n't . <p> Knicks coach Larry Brown called for a 10 a.m . New Year 's Day practice . James apparently did not spend New Year 's Eve studying game plans and dieting , so the Knicks suspended him , saving the $73,000 per game Isiah Thomas incredibly decided to give him in a five-year , $30 million jackpot for playing well for a week or two last season . <p> James , the Knicks announced , was " unprepared to practice " and suspended for " conduct detrimental to the team . " <p> Nothing was said about signing him in the first place . <p> Rant of the week : Foul 's on Cuban for not recognizing great defense <p> WHEN Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is not a crazed , wild-eyed fan ( that 's a compliment , Mark ... pretty much ) , he has roughly everything officials do counted and charted . So the crazed fan moaned this week about the officiating . <p> " What I do n't understand is how the two most aggressive defensive teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban said , " yet they 've had the fewest fouls called against them . How does that happen ? I do n't understand it . " <p> Glad to help . They 're in position . They do n't reach . They 're disciplined . <p> Fouls are occasionally a sign of aggression , but are more often the result of bad defense . The Spurs and Pistons play great defense . They do n't foul because they do n't have to . <p> It 's hard to see through the crazed , wild eyes of a fan . <p> NOTES : **25;7084;TOOLONG JED JACOBSOHN : GETTY IMAGES @x SHOULD priests be military chaplains ? Before I address that question directly , let me give you some idea of what being a chaplain was like as I experienced it . This true story may present a more convincing case for the chaplaincy than any argument . Late in the afternoon the Afghan sun was blazing in its usual merciless fashion . I was halfway through an ice-cold shower when I heard the call come over the radio , which hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the side of the makeshift shower stall . " Desert Rat 54 to the Operations Center , now ! " Whatever it was , I knew it would not be good , not when the voice on the other end sounded so agitated . It was rare that I heard my call sign on the network , let alone in such an urgent tone . I dressed in a blur , still shrugging into my equipment vest and started run- ning with my boots unlaced . As I arrived at the Ops Center , the assistant operations officer , a good friend , met me at the door . It had been his voice on the radio . " You need to get to the Med Center . There 's been an accident , we have at least two guys down . We still do n't know exacdy what happened , something with demolitions . And it sounds pretty bad . They need you there now , right now ! " Sprinting across the compound to the Med Center , I arrived just as a Humvee came to a screeching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stretcher strapped across the back of the huge vehicle . A Special Forces medic had been crouched down beside the man , working on him while the vehicle made the five-minute drive from the range to our camp . I immediately recognized the wounded soldier as a Special Forces engineer . Art ( not his real name ) was pretty well known to me . He was thuggish , one of the toughest Long Island Irish-Catholics I had ever met . In an earlier era , as a second-generation Irish-American , he might have been a cop in New York , walking his beat , knowing every inhabitant of every tenement building , alternately offering up generous helpings of advice and assistance , along with liberal applications of his nightstick to those he could not reach by more civi- lized methods . No angel ; just another sinner with good intentions most of the time and a heart of gold for the peo- ple he cared most about . That was Art . That was the man on the stretcher in front of me , the man whose arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bandaged stump with an expanding bloodstain . The next hours were a blur of activity and confusion . Two other men had been wounded in an accidental explosion on the range , though their injuries were much less serious . I prayed and recorded information while the medic and the battalion surgeon stabilized Art . A Medevac helicopter was inbound . As we prepared to load the stretcher back on board the Humvee to the landing zone , I leaned over him . Tears streamed down his face . Never , ever , in all my life , have I seen a human being so filled with fear . Not of dying , but of how different his life would be from this moment on . Leaning close , I said , " Art , do you want me to stay with you ? " Through his tears , he nodded and said , " Yes . Do n't leave . " That was that . After we loaded the wounded onto the Medevac , the crew chief tried to stop me from getting on the helicopter . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my collar from under my body armor , I showed it to him , walked past him and jumped on to the helicopter . I was not leaving my charge . For the rest of that day and into the night , I stayed in the emergency room of the field hospital where we had landed , while Art was further stabilized and prepared for surgery . I told the doctor in charge that I had promised Art I would stay with him . He allowed me to scrub in , pray with and for the surgical team in the operating room and anoint Art before they began the surgery to clean up his stump . I stayed through the whole procedure , though that was not what I had in mind when I climbed aboard the helicopter . Why the Military Needs Chaplains I have discovered that things in this world are rarely as I expect them to be , and even less frequendy are they what I want them to be . But this is the world God created me to inhabit and in which God called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is being proclaimed , and it is in this world that I have tried to help people find God . To my mind , there are four compelling reasons why priests should take up the role of military chaplain . First , Christ is present on the battlefield . The priest chaplain points as much as possible to Christ 's presence , witnesses to it by his own presence with those in the military , attests to it in preaching and praying , in listening and counseling , and offers Christ 's real presence through the sacraments . Christ 's presence also manifests itself through myriad acts of compassion even on the battlefield , which the chaplain sees , articulates , gathers up and passes on . On one occasion , as one of our medics treated the grandson of an old Afghan man in a tiny mountain valley far from anywhere , I asked him what he thought of having American soldiers in the valley . He looked at me thoughtfully for a moment and he replied : " There are some in the valley who say you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , that we should drive you from the valley . But I know only what I have seen . And what I have seen is that the Americans treat people with more compassion than many who would call themselves Muslim . " Second , even in the midst of what some Catiiolics ( and others ) might judge to be " an unjust war , " a chaplain ministers to those who need God . Without condemning or condoning a particular war effort , the chaplain ministers to everyone engaged in it . Pedro Arrape , S.J. , wrestled for a long time with a similar question , and he gradually arrived at the following reasoning : Should we give spiritual help to the guerrillas in Latin America ? No , you say ? Well , I can not say no . Perhaps in the past I have . But they are human beings , souls who are suffering . If you have a wounded person , even if he is a guerrilla you have to help him . That is the meaning of being the Good Samaritan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am being a priest now . I am helping this poor person . I do n't care if he is a guerrilla , a religious or a non-Catholic . He is a poor person . He is the poor person who is suffering . Third , the task of the chaplain is to help others find God , and the meaning that only God can provide , in a context where it is difficult to remember even that one is human . Persons in the military must work their way through ethical decisions in the midst of the chaos and violence that can call out the worst in human nature and threaten to dehumanize those embroiled in it . Frequendy a chaplain 's work is the source of a word or deed of compassion that calls good people back to themselves and helps them to remember , in the midst of horror , bloodshed and rage , who they really are and who they want to become . The chaplain reminds those in combat , those about to engage in it , and those who have returned from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they must do dieir best , for example , to distinguish between civilians and combatants . The chaplain , who is often older than many of the recruits , knows from experience that life goes on after military service is over . Consequendy , the priest helps young people in the military to comport themselves in such a way that they can live with themselves later . In wartime , too , people can show compassion and engage in camaraderie , acts the chaplain can help people to recall and reflect on . Fourth , a chaplain offers God 's abundant comfort and compassion to the suffering . The priest tends to the fearful , the sick , the lonely , the wounded and the dying . He also brings stability into an explosive environment because he celebrates the most stable sacrament of all-the love of Christ that never fails and never ends .
