Congratulations to representative Dana Rohrabacher , 56 , and his wife Rhonda , 34 , who gave birth to triplets last month . As we tend to suspect when a couple has triplets , the new parents used the services of a fertility clinic . Modern in-vitro techniques generally involve creating multiple embryos in the laboratory , transferring two or three and hoping that at least one will make it through to birth . Often it does n't work . Sometimes it works unexpectedly well . Successful or not , the process creates many more embryos than babies . There is a built-in presumption  --  really , an intention  --  that even most of the transferred embryos will die . As for embryos that are n't transferred , they get destroyed or frozen indefinitely  --  unless , that is , they are used for stem-cell research . <P> So it 's interesting that Rohrabacher has changed his position on the medical use of embryonic stem cells . The California Republican was a supporter of President Bush 's three-year-old policy severely restricting government-funded stem-cell research . But he signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging the President to reconsider that policy . Bush says he wo n't reconsider . <P> " Embryonic stem-cell studies are controversial because they involve the destruction of human embryos , " the New York Times explained in a May 6 article reporting on the shifting politics of stem-cell research . ( For example , Nancy Reagan , whose husband has Alzheimer 's , has gone public with her opposition to the Bush restrictions . ) But that ca n't be right . Fertility clinics destroy far more human embryos than stem-cell research ever would , yet they are not controversial . Death or deep freeze is the fate of any embryo spared by the Bush policy from the indignity of contributing to medical progress . <P> Stamping some issue as controversial can be a substitute for thinking it through . In the case of embryonic-stem-cell research , thinking it through does not require further study or commissions of experts . This is one you can feel free to try at home . In fact , thinking it through is a moral obligation , especially if you are on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . <P> It 's not complicated . An embryo used in stem-cell research ( and fertility treatments ) is three to five days past conception . It consists of a few dozen cells that together are too small to be seen without a microscope . It has no consciousness , no self-awareness , no ability to feel love or pain . The smallest insect is far more human in every respect except potential . <P> Is destroying that microscopic dot the exact moral equivalent of driving a knife through the heart of an innocent 6-year-old girl ? Some stem-cell enthusiasts think that even antiabortion absolutists can support stem-cell research , since it uses surplus embryos that are doomed anyhow . But that logic would justify Nazi experiments on doomed Jews in the concentration camps . If the microscopic dot is a human being with full human rights , the answer is easy : no stem-cell research .
