Excerpt // 1 // Lighting Out // All news out of Africa is bad . It made me want to go there , though not for // the horror , the hot spots , the massacre-and-earthquake stories you read in // the newspaper ; I wanted the pleasure of being in Africa again . Feeling that // the place was so large it contained many untold tales and some hope and // comedy and sweetness , too  --  feeling that there was more to Africa than // misery and terror  --  I aimed to reinsert myself in the bundu , as we used to // call the bush , and to wander the antique hinterland . There I had lived and // worked , happily , almost forty years ago , in the heart of the greenest // continent . // To skip ahead , I am writing this a year later , just back from Africa , // having taken my long safari and been reminded that all travel is a lesson in // self-preservation . I was mistaken in so much  --  delayed , shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or earthquakes , but terrific heat and the roads // were terrible , the trains were derelict , forget the telephones . Exasperated // white farmers said , " It all went tits-up ! " Africa is materially more decrepit // than it was when I first knew it  --  hungrier , poorer , less educated , more // pessimistic , more corrupt , and you can " t tell the politicians from the witch // doctors . Africans , less esteemed than ever , seemed to me the most lied-to // people on earth  --  manipulated by their governments , burned by foreign // experts , befooled by charities , and cheated at every turn . To be an African // leader was to be a thief , but evangelists stole people " s innocence , and self- // serving aid agencies gave them false hope , which seemed worse . In reply , // Africans dragged their feet or tried to emigrate , they begged , they pleaded , // they demanded money and gifts with a rude , weird sense of entitlement . // Not that Africa is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and // seedy chiefdoms . I got sick , I got stranded , but I was never bored . In fact , // my trip was a delight and a revelation . Such a paragraph needs some // explanation  --  at least a book . This book perhaps . // As I was saying , in those old undramatic days of my school- // teaching in the bundu , folks lived their lives on bush paths at the ends of // unpaved roads of red clay , in villages of grass-roofed huts . They had a new // national flag to replace the Union Jack , they had just gotten the vote , some // had bikes , many talked about buying their first pair of shoes . They were // hopeful and so was I , a teacher living near a settlement of mud huts among // dusty trees and parched fields . The children shrieked at play ; the women , // bent double  --  most with infants slung on their backs  --  hoed patches of // corn and beans ; and the men sat in the shade stupefying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kachasu , the local gin . That was taken for the // natural order in Africa : frolicking children , laboring women , idle men . // Now and then there was trouble : someone transfixed by a spear , // drunken brawls , political violence , goon squads wearing the ruling-party T- // shirt and raising hell . But in general the Africa I knew was sunlit and lovely , // a soft green emptiness of low , flat-topped trees and dense bush , bird // squawks , giggling kids , red roads , cracked and crusty brown cliffs that // looked newly baked , blue remembered hills , striped and spotted animals // and ones with yellow fur and fangs , and every hue of human being , from pink- // faced planters in knee socks and shorts to brown Indians to Africans with // black gleaming faces , and some people so dark they were purple . The // predominant sound of the African bush was not the trumpeting of elephants // nor the roar of lions but the coo-cooing of the turtledove. // After I left Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going wrong , acts of God , acts of tyrants , tribal warfare and plagues , floods // and starvation , bad-tempered political commissars , and little teenage // soldiers who were hacking people . " Long sleeves ? " they teased , cutting off // hands ; " short sleeves " meant lopping the whole arm . One million people // died , mostly Tutsis , in the Rwanda massacres of 1994 . The red African // roads remained , but they were now crowded with ragged , bundle-burdened , // fleeing refugees . // Journalists pursued them . Goaded by their editors to feed a public // hungering for proof of savagery on earth , reporters stood near starving // Africans in their last shaking fuddle and intoned on the TV news for people // gobbling snacks on their sofas and watching in horror . " And these people " //  --  tight close-up of a death rattle  --  " these are the lucky ones . " // You always think , Who says so ? Had something fundamental // changed since I was there ? I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo to Cape Town , top to bottom , and to see everything in between . // Now African news was as awful as the rumors . The place was // said to be desperate , unspeakable , violent , plague-ridden , starving , // hopeless , dying on its feet . And these are the lucky ones . I thought , since I // had plenty of time and nothing pressing , that I might connect the dots , // crossing borders and seeing the hinterland rather than flitting from capital to // capital , being greeted by unctuous tour guides . I had no desire to see game // parks , though I supposed at some point I would . The word " safari , " in // Swahili , means " journey " ; it has nothing to do with animals . Someone " on // safari " is just away and unobtainable and out of touch . // Out of touch in Africa was where I wanted to be . The wish to // disappear sends many travelers away . If you are thoroughly sick of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfect : let other people wait for a // change . Travel is a sort of revenge for having been put on hold , having to // leave messages on answering machines , not knowing your party " s // extension , being kept waiting all your working life  --  the homebound writer " s // irritants.Being kept waiting is the human condition . // I thought , Let other people explain where I am . I imagined the // dialogue : // " When will Paul be back ? " // " We don " t know . " // " Where is he ? " // " We " re not sure . " // " Can we get in touch with him ? " // " No. " // Travel in the African bush can also be a sort of revenge on cellular // phones and fax machines , on telephones and the daily paper , on the // creepier aspects of globalization that allow anyone who chooses to get his // insinuating hands on you . I desired to be unobtainable . Kurtz , sick as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s riverboat , crawling on all fours like an // animal , trying to flee into the jungle . I understood that . // I was going to Africa for the best reason  --  in a spirit of discovery ; // and for the pettiest  --  simply to disappear , to light out , with a suggestion of // I dare you to try and find me. // Home had become a routine , and routines make time pass // quickly . I was a sitting duck in my predictable routine : people knew when to // call me ; they knew when I would be at my desk . I was in such regular touch // it was like having a job , a mode of life I hated . I was sick of being called up // and importuned , asked for favors , hit up for money . You stick around too // long and people begin to impose their own deadlines on you . " I need this by // the twenty-fifth " or " Please read this by Friday " or " Try to finish this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a conference call on Wednesday . " Call me , fax me , // e-mail me . You can get me anytime on my cell phone , here " s the number . // Being available at any time in the totally accessible world seemed // to me pure horror . It made me want to find a place that was not accessible // at all : no phones , no fax machines , not even mail delivery , the wonderful old // world of being out of touch . In other words , gone away . // All I had to do was remove myself . I loved not having to ask // permission , and in fact in my domestic life things had begun to get a little // predictable , too  --  Mr. Paul at home every evening when Mrs. Paul came // home from work . " I made spaghetti sauce . . . I seared some tuna . . . I " m // scrubbing some potatoes . . . " The writer in his apron , perspiring over his // b ? chamel sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick // it up because it is ringing in your ear . // I wanted to drop out . People said , " Get a cell phone , use FedEx , // sign up for Hotmail , stop in at Internet caf ? s , visit my Web site . . . " // I said no thanks . The whole point of my leaving was to escape // this stuff , to be out of touch . The greatest justification for travel is not self- // improvement but rather performing a vanishing act , disappearing without a // trace . As Huck put it , lighting out for the territory . // Africa is one of the last great places on earth a person can vanish // into . I wanted that . Let them wait . I have been kept waiting far too many // times for far too long . // I am outta here , I told myself . The next Web site I visit will be that // of the poisonous Central African bird-eating spider . // A morbid aspect of my departure for Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " re leaving for a dangerous place . Your friends // call sympathetically , as though you " ve caught a serious illness that might // prove fatal . Yet I found these messages unexpectedly stimulating , a // heartening preview of what my own demise would be like . Lots of tears ! Lots // of mourners ! But also , undoubtedly , many people boasting solemnly , " I told // him not to do it . I was one of the last people to talk to him . " // I had gotten to Lower Egypt , and was heading south , in my usual // traveling mood : hoping for the picturesque , expecting misery , braced for the // appalling . Happiness was unthinkable , for although happiness is desirable , // it is a banal subject for travel . Therefore , Africa seemed perfect for a long // journey . //
