Holidays are hot at the Fire Research Lab , especially when it ! ; time to light up the Christmas tree . Controlled burns such as this help researchers study how quickly fire can spread . Photograph // It 's hard to take your eyes off a campfire 's dancing flames . They have energy , power . Fire can do good , from cooking food to of fering lifesaving heat . It can also do unbelievable harm . Firefighters know the dangers . They say their job is like " going into the dragon 's mouth . " A raging fire could kill in an instant if the firefighters did n't know exactly what to do to slay it . Dousing with water is one way . Firefighters call that " putting the wet stuff on the red stuff . " It usually works-but not always . That 's what 70 Maryland Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts learned during a demonstration last May at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory , a part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , Md . PP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frying pan full of grease on fire . Then , in a carefully controlled way , they let Cub Scout Christopher Ballantine try putting it out with sprayed water . The boys quickly learned that the burning grease floated on top of the gushing water and spread the fire farther . As Christopher , 10 , of Pack 73 in Gaithersburg noted : " When you use the wrong kind of extinguisher , it blows up ! " The fire researchers told the boys that a grease fire and any other fire involving liquid is called a Class B fire . These need to be put out with an extinguisher filled with compressed carbon dioxide-some- thing every kitchen should have handy . Use water only on Class A fires , those fueled by solids like paper , plastic , wood or fabric . Do n't Be a Hero Understanding a little about fire does n't mean you 're ready to fight one . If you see a fire , get help immediately . Every second counts . So the Scouts could see how fast a fire spreads , lab scientists set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , a chair and carpeting and could have been anyone 's living room . An electric match set the sofa on fire . A smoke alarm sounded 18 seconds later . The sofa began blazing . Smoke filled the room , becoming dense and black at the ceiling . Suddenly , the windows burst . A gush of flame roared out the doorway-and the room was completely in flames , or " flashover . " Total time : Three minutes 10 seconds . " It was much quicker than I thought it would be , " said Life Scout Kevin Parks , 15 , of Troop 457 in Rockville . " The flashover really surprised me . " It was a scary lesson for all the boys : Three minutes and 10 seconds to get out alive , less if the smoke stops you . Do n't be a hero . Get out and get help .

And they 're working on fire-protection gear that can protect firefighters in the wilderness . In the open , fire can become a raging tornado . Soon firefighters will carry small fire-resistant tents to hide in if a forest fire overtakes them . The fire demonstration at the lab was two unforgettable hours for the 70 Scouts . After all , it 's not often you get to stare down a dragon 's mouth . // 10 A HOME FIRE-SAFETY SURVEY Sidebar DO N'T FEED THE FIRE TRIANGLE Firefighters know the best way to fight fires is to understand them . To burn , a fire needs all the elements of the fire triangle . fuel , heat and oxygen . Take one away , and the Sidebar fire will go out . That 's why you can put out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or take away the fuel and the fire goes out . That 's why campfires die when all the wood is burned . And it is heat that can cause fires to spread . Every fire gives off radiant heat , an invisible warmth that billows out 20 feet or more . It 's what you feel when Sidebar you stand next to a campfire or fireplace . Radiant heat is the reason firefighters hose down nearby buildings during a fire . They 're creating a curtain of coolness to prevent the spread of heat energy to other buildings , where fuel and oxygen are already present . Even smoke can be fuel for more fire . Smoke is black because it contains unburned carbon , a fuel . The Scouts at the demonstration saw that you could light a smoking candle without touching the wick . A burning match has only to touch the smoke , and the flame will travel down the smoke and relight the wick . // <p>                   @ @
