" is home . " " Oh , no , " I cried , turning to Jimmy . This could n't be happening ! I could n't lose Christie . Not again ! Especially not after finally finding her ! " Wait a minute , " Jimmy said in a controlled voice . " Are you telling us that you wo n't give Dawn her baby back ? " " We did what we were supposed to do legally . Babies are not toys , " Sanford Compton lectured . " They 're not things you give and take back , things you exchange lightly . Violet has a home here now , a home in which she is loved and cherished , a home in which she will grow happily and have all the best things life has to offer . You ca n't cast her off one day and reel her in the next like some fish you throw back into the water . " " But I did n't throw her back into the water ! " I exclaimed . " My grandmother stole my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Updike make that clear ? " I cried out in dismay . " All Mr. Updike said was minds have changed ; you want the baby back . I have been in contact with my lawyers , and they have advised me I have a legal position . I intend to enforce it . " His words sent shivers down my spine . I felt as if someone had thrown a pail of ice water over me  --  a legal battle ? For my own baby ? Grandmother Cutler 's revenge continued even after her death . She was still controlling my life and happiness , even from her grave . " Look , " Jimmy said , still trying to quiet his temper , " you 're making a big mistake here . Maybe you do n't understand what happened . Dawn never agreed to  --  " " We were offered an infant that a mother did n't want , " Sanford interrupted . " My wife and I have been trying to have our own child for years now . While we want a child desperately , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my direction , " have them in a very cavalier manner and then want to get rid of them . Well , we did n't question all the details ; we accepted the conditions , signed papers and were given the child . " Now you come here and want to undo all that has been done . Some time has passed . We love Violet , and , as unlikely as it might seem to you , Violet has taken to us , especially to my wife . You ca n't play with people like you play with dolls . " " That 's not fair , Mr. Compton ! " I exclaimed . " That 's stupid , " Jimmy snapped back . " Jimmy ! " " No , he has no right to talk to us this way . He does n't know anything , " Jimmy sneered . " I know we 're not turning the baby over to you , " Sanford Compton said , standing up abruptly , " and I know I would like you two to leave my house immediately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , rising to his feet . " I told you , " Sanford Compton said calmly , " it 's not her baby anymore . Violet is our baby . " " Like hell she is , " Jimmy flared . " Come on , Dawn . We 'll go to the police . These people are stealing your baby . " " Oh , dear , " Mrs. Compton said , and this time she could not hold back her sobs . " Now look what you 've done  --  you 've upset my wife . I must insist you leave , or I will be the one to call the police . " " Do n't worry about it , " Jimmy said , reaching for my hand . " We 'll see the police , and we 'll be back . All you 're doing is making unnecessary trouble for everyone . " The butler appeared in the doorway as if Sanford Compton had pushed an invisible button calling for him . " Frazer , see these people out , please . " I looked at Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to her , " but I never agreed to the giving away of my baby . It 's not my fault . I did n't intend for this to happen . " Patricia Compton began to sob harder . " Please leave , " Sanford commanded . Jimmy and I walked out . The butler stepped back and then moved forward to open the front door for us . " Damn stupid people , " Jimmy muttered loud enough for them to hear . We stepped back into the sunlight , only to me the day had turned pale gray . It might as well be raining , I thought . Would nothing be easy for me , ever ? Mistakes haunted me like ghosts . I had begun to believe that because I was a child born from evil I would be cursed forever . The sins of the fathers do rest on the heads of their children . I could n't keep my own tears back , and before we had left the portico I was sobbing hysterically . Jimmy embraced me quickly and kissed my cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . This is n't going to be hard , " he promised . " Oh , Jimmy , do n't you see that everything 's going to be hard ? I do n't know why you would want to marry me . You 're only going to suffer along with me . I 'm cursed ! " " Come on , Dawn . Take it easy . It 's not you ; it 's what that evil old lady did . Well , we 'll just see it undone . That guy 's stupid and asking for trouble . " " I ca n't blame these people , Jimmy . He was n't all wrong . And did you see the expression on that woman 's face ? She finally got a baby she could call her own , and we 're here to take it away , " I moaned . " But you want to , do n't you ? You want Christie back ? " Jimmy asked . " Yes , of course I do . I just ca n't stand all this pain and suffering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt other people ? " I cried . " I do n't know . She did it , and it 's over with . Now we 've got to make it right . I guess we 'll go to the police first , " he said . " No , we had better check into a hotel someplace close by and call Mr. Updike . The police ca n't help us . Sanford Compton is right  --  it 's going to be a legal battle . " I looked back at the house once , trying to imagine which room Christie was in . I was sure they had bought her the finest crib and the most expensive baby clothes . Just a baby , she did n't know where she was or what had happened to her . She was probably as content as she could possibly be . In a short while I would disturb that contentment ; but I had to believe that even an infant as young as Christie would sense her own mother when she was finally placed in my arms , and that would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . Armed with that faith , I hurried off with Jimmy to begin our battle for custody of my own child . We checked into a small hotel just outside of Richmond . It was a restored old mansion , and the rooms were quiet , large and comfortable , but we were not able to enjoy anything . Our time here was to be filled with waiting for phone calls and preparation for a hearing . When I phoned Mr. Updike I was surprised at his reaction . " Maybe it would be wiser just to leave things be , " he suggested . " The baby 's in a very good home and will be very well taken care of . Sanford Compton is wealthy and powerful in his community . " " I do n't care how wealthy he is , Mr. Updike . Christie is my baby , and I want her back , " I said sharply . " I thought you had explained it all to the Comptons , " I continued , not disguising my annoyance . If he intended to continue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now that I was the majority owner of the hotel and property . " I did n't get into the nitty-gritty details with them , " he confessed . " I was just trying to protect the Cutler name . You can imagine what a field day the newspaper people would have with such a story , and that might very well reflect on the hotel . " " Mr. Updike , " I said , speaking through clenched teeth , " if I do n't get Christie back and get her back soon , I will feed the story to the newspapers myself ! " I flared . " I see , " he said . " I just want you to understand what will be exposed  --  your affair with this older man , your pregnancy out of wedlock , your  --  " " I know what I 've done , and I know what has happened , Mr. Updike . My baby is more important to me than any of that . If you ca n't help me and help me quickly , I will see another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat or anger . He cleared his throat . " Oh , I 'll help you . I just wanted you to understand all the aspects of this , " he quickly explained . " What do we do next ? " I demanded . " Well , I know some people there . I 'll get right on it . Maybe we can settle this in a closed hearing in front of a judge with just the attorneys and parties present . I 'll work toward that , and hopefully  --  " " Then Jimmy and I will remain here and await your making the arrangements quickly , " I emphasized . " Okay . I 'll call you . Where are you ? " I gave him the place and the number and repeated my desire to have the problem solved as quickly as possible . He promised to get right on it . The day after I had first phoned Mr. Updike he finally called to say he had managed to get the Comptons and their attorney to agree to a hearing in front of a supreme court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Comptons and an acquaintance of Mr. Updike . " If Mr. Compton is so powerful around here and this judge is his friend , will he be fair ? " I asked with concern . " Well , this is sort of an off-the-record hearing , a favor the judge is doing for both of us , " Mr. Updike explained . " We can always turn to formal legal remedies afterward if we 're not satisfied with the outcome . The Comptons are n't happy about the prospect of a public hearing either . " He gave me the address and time to be at the judge 's chambers and told us he would meet us there an hour earlier . It was an afternoon meeting . I was so nervous about it , I could n't eat a thing for lunch . " It 's going to be okay , " Jimmy continued to assure me . " Once everyone understands the truth of what happened , it will be settled simply and quickly . " " Oh , Jimmy , I 'm not as confident as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanford Compton is , a man of great influence with politicians and lawyers alike , and he 's forever reminding me about the sordid details of my background . " " I do n't care about any of that , " Jimmy insisted . " The truth is the truth , and Christie is your baby , " he said with a firmness that helped me to revive some of my own confidence . " I 'm so glad you 're with me , Jimmy . I could n't do any of this without you , " I told him . He reached across the table in the restaurant where we were having our lunch and put his hand over mine . " I would n't want to be anywhere else but at your side , Dawn . Now and forever . " I wanted to kiss him there and then , but we were surrounded by people , all well-dressed and sophisticated looking . It was a fancy restaurant , too , and I was sensitive about doing anything that might attract attention and gossip . Jimmy said events were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He laughed but made me promise to kiss him twice as much when we were alone . The afternoon of the hearing was gray and even a bit chilly . Fall was creeping in like a wolf on the prowl around a chicken coop . It cast its shadow first . Birds seemed more restless around us , their biological clocks ticking closer and closer to that hour when they would be nudged to go off and seek warmer climates . Clouds looked darker and more ominous , and the wind was stronger . Leaves weakened by age snapped off branches and began their slow singsong descents to the ground , while other leaves had begun to take on tints of orange and yellow and brown . Mr. Updike met us in the lobby . Although he was an elderly man , easily in his early seventies , he carried himself with an air of strength and authority characteristic of men much younger . His cap of white hair still had a slight wave in front , and he stood firm with broad shoulders and a bit of a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deep , resonant voice restored some faith and confidence in me . He shook hands with Jimmy firmly and described quickly how he wanted to conduct the meeting . " Just let me do all the talking until Judge Powell asks you questions . " I nodded . Just then we saw Sanford and Patricia Compton enter the building with their attorney . Mr. Compton was holding Mrs. Compton at the elbow as if she had to be guided along . She had her lace handkerchief closed in her small left fist . I saw the terror and fear in her face when she glanced our way . It sent shivers of ice through my heart . The Comptons ' attorney was a shorter man with a much slimmer build but a surprisingly beautiful speaking voice . As a musician and singer , I could n't help but notice . His name was Felix Humbrick , and the moment he began to talk I knew we were in for a time of it . We all gathered in the judge 's chambers , a large office on the second floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined with shelves containing volumes and volumes of law books . On the wall behind the judge 's large , dark oak desk were framed pictures of Judge Powell shaking hands with politicians , even one showing him with the president . All of it gave the office a magisterial air of authenticity and officialdom . There was a feeling we should whisper when we spoke . The Comptons and their attorney took one side of the room , and we took the other , with both attorneys sitting in the leather chairs closest to the desk . Mr. Compton refused to look our way , but every once in a while Patricia Compton gazed at me , her eyes glassy . Judge Powell was an intense man , focusing sharply on whoever spoke as if he could see into the speaker 's face , behind his words . Of course , I studied his face for some hint as to what he was feeling , but when he began to conduct the hearing his face became a mask  --  his lips unmoving , his eyes simply reflecting what he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was as still as the statue of Justice herself . " I would like it understood at the start , " the judge began , " that this is an informal hearing requested and agreed to by both sides concerned , and therefore I have not asked for a stenographer to take down any notes or record the proceedings . Also , any recommendations I might make at the conclusion of this informal hearing are not binding on either party , nor can they be used as evidence or testimony in any formal hearing that might result . Is that clear ? " " Yes , Your Honor , " Mr. Updike said quickly . " Quite clear , Your Honor , " Felix Humbrick said . " As agreed to beforehand , then , we will begin with Mr. Humbrick , " the judge said , and he turned his swivel chair slightly so that he was looking directly at Felix Humbrick . Jimmy took my hand and squeezed it gently . " Thank you , Your Honor . As you know , my clients , Sanford and Patricia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naturally , they were concerned about the child 's background and were very happy to learn from a friend of theirs that the birth of a baby whose background was clearly known was imminent . This friend , who has asked that his name not be brought into the matter unless absolutely necessary , was a close friend of Lillian Cutter , the owner and operator of Cutler 's Cove Hotel . " Mrs. Cutler had passed on the information that her granddaughter had had an illicit affair . In short , she was seduced by an older man while she was away at school in New York City . As a result she became pregnant . " Mrs. Cutler and her granddaughter , for obvious reasons , wanted the matter kept confidential , so Mrs. Cutler arranged for her granddaughter to leave school and reside at Mrs. Cutler 's sister 's home until such time as the baby was born . Mrs. Cutler 's sister is an experienced midwife . " Faced with the prospect of having a child at such a young age , and a child out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical career , Mrs. Cutler 's granddaughter agreed to have her child placed for adoption . She signed documents to this effect , willingly giving her child to Mr. and Mrs. Compton immediately after the baby 's birth . " The events followed suit as outlined . The Comptons accepted the infant in their home , proceeded to take all necessary medical steps to insure the baby 's well-being and quickly developed an emotional tie to the infant . They have even named the baby after Mr. Compton 's deceased mother . " Now , as you know , Mrs. Cutler 's granddaughter wishes the child to be returned . We feel her request is unreasonable , arbitrary , a violation of a contract entered into in good faith . In point of fact , the contract was drawn up by the Cutler family counsel himself , and none of the covenants were challenged . One of these covenants reads , ' Mr. and Mrs. Sanford Compton of 12 Hardy Drive accept full responsibility for the health and welfare of said infant from the date of delivery and agree not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said infant , to wit the life and limb of said infant will from this day forward remain their sole responsibility . ' " I emphasize ' sole responsibility , ' Your Honor , a stipulation to which they wholeheartedly agreed and which they undertook , for which Dawn Cutler and the Cutler family then agreed to make no other demands or inquiries concerning the said infant . " This is all signed , sealed and delivered , " he concluded , sliding the document onto the judge 's desk . Judge Powell looked at it quickly , turning to the page for signatures , and then nodded without expression . He swung his swivel chair in our direction . " Mr. Updike , your presentation ? " " We do n't contest the contract , Your Honor . We are here today , however , to present some new facts , the main fact being that Dawn Cutler did not agree to this , nor was she aware of it . " " Not aware of it ? " " No , Your Honor , " Mr. Updike said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I could feel his embarrassment . " You drew this up without speaking with the mother ? " " I ... yes . I had been assured by my client that the mother agreed to all of it . Dawn was some distance away , living under the circumstances described . Mrs. Cutler assured me that the decision to give up the infant was one she , Dawn 's mother and father , and Dawn herself thought best for all concerned . " " And the signature on this document ? " the judge asked . Mr. Updike seemed uncomfortable in his seat now . He shifted , cleared his throat and spoke . " Apparently it is forged . " " Forged ? " The judge finally reacted to something . His eyebrows lifted slightly . " You did n't bother to compare it with samples , I assume ? " " I had no reason to be suspicious , Your Honor . I have been the Cutler family 's attorney for quite a number of years now , and my experience has always been that Mrs. Cutler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business acumen . " " Your Honor ? " Felix Humbrick interrupted . " Yes ? " " We have other samples of Dawn Cutler 's signature here , and they match perfectly . It is our contention that it is not forged . " He submitted the documents . The judge looked at them . " Mr. Updike , I 'm not a handwriting expert , but these do look quite similar . " He handed the documents to our lawyer . Mr. Updike gazed at them and then took off his glasses , folded them and placed them in his upper pocket . " Your Honor , I do n't know how the forgery was committed , but I have no doubt that it was , " he said . " I see , " Judge Powell replied . " Can you share your reasoning with us ? " Mr. Updike turned to look my way . He saw in my face that I wanted him to go on and do and say whatever was necessary for me to get Christie back . " Your Honor , Mrs. Cutler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents were unsealed . It was learned  --  painfully learned  --  that Dawn Cutler is not Mrs. Cutler 's granddaughter . " Patricia Compton , who had been staring down throughout all this , lifted her head sharply and looked across the office at me with new interest . " I see . Go on , " Judge Powell said . " Apparently Dawn Cutler was Lillian Cutler 's husband 's child . " " You mean she is her daughter ? " " No , Your Honor . " " I see , " Judge Powell said quickly . " You do n't have to go into those details any further . " " I do n't understand , " Sanford Compton said angrily . " What does this base behavior have to do with anything ? " " Mr. Updike is suggesting another possible motive for the actions Mrs. Cutler took . There is a clear history of subterfuge and deception here . Miss Cutler , " the judge said , turning to me . The moment he did , I felt my heart jump and the heat rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing this contract ? " " Yes , sir . " " What did you intend to do when your baby was born ? " he asked softly . " I do n't know , Your Honor . I wanted my baby very much and was shocked to discover she had been given away . " " Mrs. Cutler did n't threaten you or advise you of the difficulties that lay ahead and as a result convince you to sign this document ? " " No , sir . I never saw Grandmother Cutler after I left New York to go to The Meadows . " " The Meadows ? " He looked at Mr. Updike . " Mrs. Cutler 's sister 's home . " " I see . So until you returned you had no knowledge of Mr. and Mrs. Compton ? " " That 's correct , Your Honor . " " Why did you agree to have your baby in secret if you had no intention of giving her away ? " the judge asked . " Your Honor , I was n't in any position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but I never knew what her full intentions were . Of course , now I understand why she hated me and why she would n't have wanted any child of mine in her presence . " " I see . " Judge Powell turned away and sat back a moment . Then he lifted his eyes toward the Comptons . " Mr. and Mrs. Compton , the information Mr. Updike has presented does create some definite gray areas . While it is true you do have an apparently legal contract , there is some reason for it to be challenged . Any formal court hearing will obviously bring all this new information to bear , and I suspect that Mr. Updike has only scratched the surface of it here today . " In short , unfortunate as it might be for you , you should take into consideration the ugly atmosphere in which this case will be argued . It does n't bode well for the future of the child even if your position should prevail . " He leaned forward . " It could very well become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanford Compton nodded and then embraced her . " We had no idea about all these other circumstances , " he said angrily . " Of course not , " the judge said in a soothing voice . He sat back . " Mr. Humbrick , I recommend  --  informally recommend  --  that you advise your clients to return the infant to its mother forthwith . " " We will take your advice under serious consideration Your Honor , " Felix Humbrick replied . " Sanford , " he said softly . " Thank you , Judge , " Sanford Compton said . He helped his wife to her feet , and they started out of the judge 's chambers , Mrs. Compton 's sobbing growing harder . Felix Humbrick rose and turned to Mr. Updike . " Are you staying anywhere in town ? " " I was n't intending on it . Why do n't I phone your office ? How long do you want ? " " Give me two hours , " Mr. Humbrick replied . They shook hands , and he followed the Comptons out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . My legs felt so weak and wobbly , I was afraid to stand . " Well , " Judge Powell said , " something like this is very unpleasant . You have a great deal to overcome , young lady , some of it not your fault , but some of the blame rests with YOU . " " I know , Your Honor . " " Apparently you have found a champion to stand at your side , " he said , his eyes twinkling at Jimmy . " I can only wish you good luck from now on . " " Thank you , " I said . Jimmy and I stood up . " I 'll be right out , " Mr. Updike said . We left him with the judge and retreated to the lobby . We could see Sanford Compton speaking heatedly with Mr. Humbrick outside . Patricia had apparently already gone to their car . A few moments later they left , too . Mr. Updike decided we should return to our hotel . I was so nervous and frightened , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were filled with tiny moths all flapping their paper-thin wings at once . Mr. Updike kept telling us how sorry he was all this had happened , how Grandmother Cutler 's actions had been so out of character for her . I understood he had great respect for her , and when he described her in her early days I almost wished I had been alive then to see her in a different light . Two hours later Mr. Updike called Felix Humbrick and learned the Comptons had agreed to give up the fight . I broke into a flood of hysterical tears of happiness . Even Jimmy had tears in his eyes as he embraced me . " Sanford Compton has asked that you stop by as soon as possible to get the baby . He does n't want their pain and agony to last a moment longer than necessary , " Mr. Updike told us . " Of course , " Jimmy said . " We 'll go right over . " " Thank you , Mr. Updike , " I said . " I know how difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Powell had chastised him for not being more assured that I had been a party to the agreement . He did n't strike me as the kind of man who made such mistakes . But in a real sense , he had been violated by Grandmother Cutler , too . He was just unwilling to face up to that , for reasons I had yet to understand . Some of the shadows and the skeletons in the closets of the Cutler family had been exposed and revealed , but deep in my heart I knew there were closet doors yet to be opened . Sanford Compton was a different man when Jimmy and I arrived at the house to get Christie this time . He allowed Frazer to show us in , and he greeted us in the hallway standing beside a box , which , he explained , contained things he had bought for Christie . " Some baby clothing , diapers , crib toys and the formula our pediatrician recommended .

" " I 'll just get this out to the car , " Jimmy said , picking up the carton . " Thank you . " " I am sorry how all this worked out , " Sanford said when he and I were alone for a moment . " It was never our intention to add to anyone 's suffering . " " No , no . It was n't your fault . You were n't told the truth , " I said . " If I had been , you can be damn sure it would n't have gone this far , " he replied , his eyes icy blue again . " Your grandmother , or the woman who called herself that , must have been some piece of work . " I could n't help but laugh at his description , but my joviality was short-lived , for when I lifted my gaze toward the stairway I saw Patricia Compton coming down slowly , baby Christie in her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in anxiety , because Patricia walked as if she were under a spell . To me it appeared she could fold up at any moment and topple down the staircase , dropping the baby out of her embrace . " I wanted to do all of this , " Sanford whispered , " but she insisted . " I stepped forward quickly to greet her at the base of the stairway . She stopped two steps from the bottom and stared at me . Christie was wrapped in a pink blanket , her tiny nose and chin barely visible . Patricia continued to gaze at me silently . Her sad eyes and trembling lips kept me from simply reaching out to seize Christie . " She 's just been fed , and she 's dozing , " Patricia finally said . " She always drops right off after a feeding . Sometimes "  --  Patricia smiled  --  " sometimes she falls asleep with the nipple of the bottle still in her lips .

" Give Miss Cutler her child now , Patricia , " Sanford said firmly but softly . " What ? Oh , yes , yes . " She lifted the baby toward me , and I stepped forward quickly to take Christie in my arms . When I looked down into her little face I finally felt the shadow lift from my heart , filling with sunshine and joy . I had forgotten how blond her hair was . It looked like a crown of gold . " Thank you , " I said , turning back to Patricia . " I am truly sorry for the pain you are suffering now . " Patricia 's lips trembled harder . Her chin began to wrinkle , and her shoulders started to shake . " Patricia . You promised , " Sanford reminded her . She took a deep breath and pressed her small fists into her bosom as if to hold her sorrow inside . " I 'm sorry , " she whispered . " We 'd better be going , Dawn , " Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . Thank you for the baby 's things , " I told Sanford . He nodded , but I could see he , too , was holding back a flood of tears . Jimmy and I started out of the house . Just as Frazer closed the door behind us we heard Patricia Compton 's wail . It was a loud , shrill scream , the moan any mother would express if her child were being taken away . The heavy front door was closed rapidly , and it mercifully entrapped the wail within . Even so , Jimmy and I hurried down the walkway , driven along by the horror of Patricia Compton 's agony . Neither of us spoke until Jimmy had started the engine and driven off . I could n't help but gaze back once more at the house and grounds that might have been Christie 's home . Then I closed my eyes and drove the image back into the deepest closets of my memory . When I opened my eyes again I gazed down at my baby , her tiny pink face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
