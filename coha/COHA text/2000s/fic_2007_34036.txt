We always seek out forbidden things and long for whatever is denied us.  - -  Francois Rabelais , Gargantua and Pantagruel , 1532-1564 Outside the tall bow windows of the Paris Opera ballet school , dusk embraced the city in a grayish pink veil , settling around spires of cathedrals and draping across bridges of the Seine . Inside the cavernous rehearsal hall , Victorine Laurent 's fellow students practiced plies under the critical eye of their pudgy dance master , Monsieur Jules . The violinist yawned as he scratched out a listless Chopin nocturne . The girls ' middle-aged mothers nested on folding chairs , gossiping and clutching tattered shawls against the evening chill . In the bright vestibule , Victorine cupped her hands against the glass-paned French doors and scanned the room for Edgar Degas . Was she too late for their appointment ? No , there he was in his sketching corner , but not alone . Another gentleman stood with him off to the side , observing the girls in the flickering gaslight . When Degas caught sight of her , he nudged his companion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls . She tugged the decollete of her crimson taffeta frock just a touch lower , took a deep breath , and threw open the double doors , slicing the room with a shaft of light . As she approached , Victorine 's gaze riveted to the other gentleman . Degas introduced her , and Victorine lowered her face in the charming way she had practiced a thousand times in her cheval glass . Then she glanced up at the stranger , held his gaze a moment longer than was proper . The shine of a silk top hat , the sparkle of a gold watch chain , and the polish of leather boots spoke to her of affluence . " So ! This is the gentleman from Marseille you told me so much about . " She smiled sweetly , extending her hand . There was a moment of confusion before Degas realized the mistaken identity . " No , no , this is n't the banker chap . This is Edouard Manet ! He 's an artist , Victorine . He wants you to model for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then turned to walk away . Edouard Manet grabbed her wrist . " Wait a moment . What 's wrong with artists ? They ca n't afford to buy you a carriage and pair ? " So he understood where her priorities lay . " I 've never heard of you , Monsieur Manet . Have you exhibited in the Salon ? " " He has , " Degas said . " Just not very often . " The yearly Salon competition sponsored by the prestigious Academie francaise held the entire city of Paris enthralled . It was ostensibly open to all artists , but everyone knew that the conservative jury was notable for rejecting work deemed too iconoclastic . " I 'd wager you 've never seen paintings like mine . " Edouard scribbled an address on the back of his calling card . " Come to the studio , judge my work , then decide . " He watched her face closely . " I pay my models well . " A flicker of interest lit her eyes . " I 'll consider it . But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present as chaperone . " " You flatter yourself , mademoiselle , " Edouard laughed . " When I choose a model , it 's for the music inside them . " She was taken aback by the poetry of his remark . " Do I possess music ? " Her tone turned soft . " Perhaps . " Victorine pulled her thin wool mantelet closer around her shoulders as she and Degas sipped cremes in the cool morning air . They chatted under the green canvas awning of her favorite cafe near the cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette , in the quartier where she and many young women of her social class lived . They were called lorettes -- not quite as debased as streetwalkers , not quite as exalted as courtesans . " After boarding school , Manet could have followed his father 's wishes and become a barrister or chosen a position in banking or the stock exchange , " Degas said . " But he has a talent that will propel him higher . " Degas sat back . " He has the hands of an artist coupled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to change the way the world 's perceived . " Degas named obscure artists Victorine had never heard of -- Monet , Renoir , and Cezanne -- who had chosen Edouard Manet as their Apollo . " Of them all , Manet has the cool , analytical intelligence to be a painter of his own time . " Victorine swirled the spoon in her cup , contemplating Manet . " Tell him I 'll come tomorrow afternoon at three . " The next day at the scheduled hour , Victorine knocked at the black lacquered door of Edouard Manet 's flat . As footsteps approached inside , she glanced down and noticed that her hem was splattered with the reddish brown mud of Paris 's ubiquitous construction pits . And it was her best dress , the only one made of silk satin . Her side-laced ankle boots were caked with mud as well . Too late now to regret walking to save six sous on omnibus fare . The door swung open and Edouard bowed with an exaggerated flair . Victorine paused under the shimmering gas jets of the foyer chandelier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed it with her fringed parasol on the marble-top bureau . She knew that even within the modest budget of a lorette she looked as delectable as a candy box in a confectionery shop ; her luxuriant dark hair , swept back into a sophisticated chignon , had taken her hairdresser painstaking time to accomplish . The faux pearl-and-rhinestone earrings pulled the eye to her expertly powdered and rouged face , pink and white as a Fragonard galante , perfect in every feature . Except . Except for a cruel oval scar below her left cheek , which marred the flawless surface . Sensing Edouard appreciatively scanning her from behind , she swayed a bit more seduction into her hips , a cascade of lilac satin ruffles sweeping the dusty floorboards with each step . As she approached the parlor , she glanced at the fine upholstered furnishings , the damask drapes tied back with tasseled silk cords , the gleaming mahogany end tables , and puzzled over the incongruity of these treasures residing in an obscure young artist 's studio in the seedy Batignolles district . In the parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while two other gentlemen rose from the crimson velvet divan . The older , distinguished-looking one was a Corinthian column of a man exuding a powerful presence and intimidating demeanor . The other , a willowy chap with vaguely feminine features , was shorter than Victorine and slight of build . What a comical picture they created standing side by side . Edouard introduced the younger man as Andre , the Marquis de Montpellier . He adjusted his cravat and slicked back a stray lock of fine , blond hair . The soft peach fuzz on his cheeks and the spray of freckles across his nose hinted that he could be no more than her age , seventeen , or eighteen at the most . She commented that her favorite shopping street in Paris was the boulevard de Montpellier , no doubt named for his illustrious ancestors ? He replied that he was just a humble writer , and could take no credit for his family 's storied past . Judging by his threadbare suit of clothes , Victorine surmised that the family had moved out of the ancestral chateau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older gentleman waited patiently for his turn . Edouard introduced him as Monsieur Baudelaire . She instantly recognized the name of Charles Baudelaire , the poet and author , esteemed as one of the greatest thinkers of the age . " Monsieur Baudelaire , this is an honor . I 'm a great admirer of your work . " Not one to be as inveigled as the young marquis by flattery , Baudelaire questioned her as to which , if any , of his " humble scribblings " she had read ? She wanted him to know that she had a good education , was n't some vulgar cocotte from the streets . " I loved an essay you published recently about women . I committed a phrase to memory : ' Woman is a divinity , a star which presides over all the conceptions of the brain of Man . ' " " Quite right , my essay in Le Figaro last week ! " He seemed impressed . He asked how Victorine had come to meet Manet . " I pressed Degas for an introduction after seeing her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't blame Manet for being intrigued by your beauty . " Baudelaire smiled at Victorine . " Not mere beauty , " Edouard said . " Beneath the surface , there 's light and shadow . " The four gentlemen fell silent and scrutinized her . Victorine felt like a display at Le Bon Marche department store . " Such opposites warring in one human being , that 's the entire matter right there , is n't it ? Chiaroscuro , " Edouard said . Victorine asked the meaning of that foreign word . " Light and shadow . It 's Italian , " Edouard explained . " Victorine , you told me your parents were famous Italian musicians . Did n't you say they toured the Continent performing for royalty ? " Degas asked . " You must have me confused with someone else . I was born in Vienna . My father was fencing master at the Habsburg court . " By the looks exchanged between the gentlemen , she could see they did n't believe her . After all , it was common knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backgrounds . The junior ballerinas were amateurs chosen for their beauty , not their dancing skills , to perform in the short ballet entr'acte . They supplemented their meager salaries by becoming the coddled mistresses of rich married bankers , real estate speculators , and industrialists . No sophisticated person believed that a love of Wagner or Verdi brought these nouveaux riches to the Opera every Thursday ; they came solely to admire their mistresses ' long legs in short tutus . Gossip in the dressing room usually centered on ballerinas who had been passed around by wealthy protectors for years , only to resort to common street prostitution . But Victorine had no intention of following that downward spiral . She was seventeen and knew she had only a few good years left . She took Edouard 's arm . " Where are these masterpieces of yours , Monsieur Manet ? If I 'm to sit for a portrait , I 'd better see what I 've gotten myself into . " Edouard led her to the hallway lined with canvases . There were landscapes , cityscapes , and portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she surveyed the paintings without comment , twisting her gloves in her hands as she evaluated the intense colors and the thick impasto slashed on the canvas by palette knife . Edouard followed one step behind . " Well " she turned to him at last --  " thank you . " " Do n't you like my work ? " He seemed crushed . " I do n't want to say they 're good or bad . " She chose her words as thoughtfully as a woman trying on hats in a millinery shop . " I can only say I do n't understand them . This one . " She pointed to a group portrait of outdoor concertgoers in a shady garden setting . " Some faces in the crowd have features , while others are blurred . And this one . " She indicated a portrait of an old peasant . " They say one judges an artist 's talent by how he depicts the hands . Those hands look like lumps of raw dough . I do n't wish to insult your art , but . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mademoiselle . " Baudelaire stepped forward . " Consider for a moment . Why do you feel uncomfortable ? Critics feel uneasy because it 's too radical . But should a modern artist imitate the ancient world , model the human figure after a classical Greek sculpture ? Do we stroll the streets of Paris in togas ? " " No . . . but an artist should paint subjects as he truly sees them . " " That 's precisely what he does ! When one looks , one sees refracted light , not colors . Light is a symbol of our time , and Manet is a master of that light . " " Baudelaire , please . . . , " Edouard protested . Baudelaire held up his hand for silence . " Leonardo taught his students saper vedere -- knowing how to see . Manet is the Leonardo of our times . Someday his talent will be recognized . " She glanced at the pictures lined up across the wall and calculated her options . They did n't know her yet , could little fathom that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthier , more powerful replacement for Dr. LeBrun , the married dentist who currently paid her rent and dressmaker bills . She deliberated that being associated with Manet and his odd painting style might damage her reputation . Yet it was also possible that with a portrait on display at the Salon for all to see , her image would be exposed to a wide audience of potential suitors and she could rise faster up the ladder of success . She had read about a man named P. T. Barnum in America who used this phenomenon --  " advertising "  - -  to profitable effect . " Yes , I will sit for you , Monsieur Manet . " They drank some fine Veuve Clicquot , and Victorine felt Edouard 's gaze luxuriate in the curves of her shoulders and slide down the nape of her neck . She caught his glance , evaluating her skin tone , cream of custard , and tracing her mouth , the aspect of angel 's wings , and lingering over the scar . He reached out to touch it . " How did you --  " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head away . " Tomorrow morning , ten o'clock . We 'll begin work . " He grasped her hand , but she recoiled . " Do n't expect anything more . " Her voice had the sound of a door slamming shut . " You 're not what I want . " " Not what you want ? " " Not what I need . " Her voice softened . " As you wish , " he said . " A strictly professional relationship . " She allowed him to escort her to the hallway as the other men watched , and felt his gaze following her as she walked down the four flights of marble steps . She wanted him to understand from the start that there was to be no love affair , nothing to distract her from her goal : financial security . As Victorine stepped onto the boulevard des Batignolles , dusk was falling and the lamplighters with their long poles illuminated the streetlamps . How difficult would it be to keep Manet at a distance while engaging in the intimate act of posing for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio and the tender way he touched her face , he was accustomed to females succumbing to the Manet charm . But she was accustomed to balding heads , middle-aged paunches , and the financial benefits an aged mouth on hers could provide . Chapter Two ' T is to create , and in creating live .  - -  Lord Byron , Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage , 1812 Victorine knocked for several minutes and began to doubt that anyone was home . As she turned to leave , the door creaked open to reveal Andre de Montpellier cinching closed his silk dressing gown . He smoothed down a cowlick of fine , blond hair and welcomed her in , waving a brown bottle of elixir and mumbling about his delicate constitution and a devilish bout of dyspepsia . " Do you live here ? " Victorine asked , glancing at him as he weaved down the foyer behind her . " My rent 's in arrears and I 'm staying with Manet until payday next week at Le Moniteur . " Victorine considered this new tidbit .
