Forget Paris and London . For the folks furthest out on fashion 's cutting edge , Berlin is the new capital of creative inspiration . In the past few years , designers like Hedi Slimane of Christian Dior and labels like Hugo Boss have looked to the former East Berlin for inspiration , attracted by its edgy art and music scenes and fashion-forward street life . Slimane rented a studio there for three years while producing a glossy photography installation and a book about the city . Last fall Hugo Boss , which is based in Metzingen , in southern Germany , held its annual fashion show and party in an abandoned Berlin post office . The look of Berlin  --  a low-key mix of vintage leather coats , rolled-up scarves and knee-high boots  --  has been a favorite for several seasons . And the city is widely cited as a wellspring of electronic dance music . " Everybody in fashion and music in Europe is going to Berlin now to get ideas , " says Phillip Wolff , communications director at Hugo Boss . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's had a very big impact on what 's going on in the rest of Europe . " <P> Creative types have long been drawn to Berlin because of low rents , ample studio space and the relatively low cost of living . The German capital 's last cultural heyday was in the 1970s , when the likes of David Bowie and Iggy Pop lived in the then divided city . Now musicians , artists and designers from as far afield as Denmark and Japan are giving Berlin a young vibe again  --  nearly half of its 3.4 million residents are under 35 . " Berlin is not a rich city , so the scene is not at all about money or society or status , " says Slimane . " People just do n't have those values . Everyone here is creating , so there is a very different rhythm . It 's a very free territory . " <P> Spurning conventional retail wisdom , designers like Bernard Willhelm and Kostas Murkudis sell their clothes in anonymous shops in the Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg districts ; shoppers track down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Many retailers take out short leases , so their establishments come and go in a matter of months , while the locations of shops like Apartment and clubs like Fun are passed on by word of mouth . Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo was so inspired by Berlin 's transient scene that she opened her own " guerrilla " Comme des Garcons store in East Berlin in February and plans to close it after a year . <P> " These are not touristy places , " says Martin Wuttke , the creative visionary behind nextguruNow , a Berlin consulting firm . " If you want to attract the fashion crowd , you ca n't show off in everybody 's face here . " Berlin 's understated cool looks set to keep the crowd coming back for more .  --  By Kate Betts
