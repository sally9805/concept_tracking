Section : Search and Discovery Ligand-coated droplets of oil can travel through the bloodstream to attach themselves to malignant cells . <p> Cancer kills its victims when the tumor burden in their bodies reaches about 10 13 cells . Before then , when a tumor comprises about 10 10 cells and is the size of a sugar cube , a physician can usually find it in an x ray or MRI scan . At that stage , if treated promptly , a victim may survive . <p> Too often , however , cancer lurks unnoticed until it 's past curing . Lack of resolution is n't what frustrates early detection . Clinical MRI and x-ray machines can resolve features a few hundred micrometers across . Rather , the difficulty lies in identifying a small blob of cells whose combined malignancy is too weak to signal where to look and whose appearance in an MRI or x-ray image is too similar to the surrounding , healthy tissue . <p> But at the molecular level , cancer cells look and behave quite differently from healthy cells . They reproduce faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in far greater numbers . <p> Among a cancer cell 's molecular output are transmembrane proteins called integrins . Integrins take part in angiogenesis , the process by which tumors build networks of blood vessels that tap into the host 's blood supply . Without siphoned nutrients , a tumor ca n't grow beyond a few tens of cells . <p> Like some other proteins , integrins can be disabled when antibodies of just the right shape lock on to them . In 1998 , Dorothy Sipkins and her collaborators at Stanford University and the Scripps Research Institute exploited integrin 's role in angiogenesis and the specificity of its antibodies to create a new method for flagging tumors. ( n1 ) <p> Sipkins 's idea was to coat liposomes ( artificial , cell-like capsules of fluid ) with integrin antibodies and MRI contrast agents . Thanks to the antibodies , the liposomes would attach to the sites of angiogenesis . The contrast agents would act as beacons , boosting and sharpening the MRI signal . <p> At 300  --  350 nm across , the coated liposomes qualified  --  metrically speaking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors into the hind legs of rabbits . After giving the tumors time to form new blood vessels , she injected the liposomes into the rabbits ' bloodstreams . Twenty-four hours later , the angiogenesis sites showed up in MRI scans . <p> Now , a team led by Greg Lanza and Sam Wickline of Washington University in St. Louis ( WUSTL ) has extended the technique. ( n2 ) Like the Stanford  --  Scripps team , the WUSTL researchers coat nanoparticles with integrin antibodies and MRI contrast agents , but instead of liposomes , they use an emulsion of nanoscale droplets , which are easier to make and carry more contrast agents . Testing their nanoparticles on rabbits , they see significant MRI enhancement after just two hours . <p> Lanza and Wickline intend to register the nanoparticles with the US Food and Drug Administration as what the agency calls an investigational new drug . Clinical trials should begin in 2006 . Oil , water , and lipids <p> Making nanoparticles the WUSTL way is a bit like making salad dressing . Instead of olive oil and balsamic vinegar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfluorooctylbromide ( PFOB ) . And instead of a whisk , they use a micro-fluidizer , a device that forces mixtures through a fine sieve to create an emulsion of nanoscale droplets , shown schematically in figure 1 . <p> The immiscibility of PFOB and water also provides a way to coat the droplets . When mixed with PFOB and water , lipids seek the interface between the two liquids . At the interface , the lipids ' hydrophilic heads point into the water , while their hydrophobic tails point into the PFOB . Coating a droplet with functional groups is simply a matter of binding the groups to the lipids ' hydrophilic ends , a task that can be done before mixing and emulsification . <p> For the antibody , Lanza and Wickline use a synthetic peptide . For the MRI contrast agent , they use gadolinium ions . Thanks to their seven unpaired electrons , Gd 3+ ions are extremely paramagnetic and , following an MRI pulse , can help protons in their vicinity regain equilibrium faster than distant protons . This difference in recovery time ( T 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 90 000 Gd 3+ ions that cover a typical WUSTL nanoparticle speed up T 1 relaxation rates by a factor of a million . <p> The WUSTL nanoparticles are about 250 nm in diameter . If the particles were much larger , lungs would trap them . If the particles were smaller , they could n't carry enough contrast agents to enhance images . Twelve rabbits <p> During angiogenesis , proliferating cancer cells break through the walls of the host 's blood vessels and create holes . The blood that feeds the growing tumor leaks through the holes and through the newly forming vessels . <p> Because of this leakiness , any nanoparticles , whether studded with sticky antibodies or not , can make their way out of the bloodstream and pool temporarily around the tumor . To verify that their nanoparticles adhere to the sites of angiogenesis , Lanza and Wickline divided their experimental subjects  --  12 rabbits  --  into three groups of four . <p> The targeted group received integrin-targeted , gadolinium-covered nanoparticles . The control group received nontargeted gadolinium-covered nanoparticles . The competitive blockade group received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaging began . That group then received a dose of targeted , covered nanoparticles . <p> All 12 rabbits were implanted with a tumor , each about 2 x 2 x 2 mm3 in size . The WUSTL researchers then waited for 12 days before injecting the rabbits with the nanoparticles . That 's enough time for a tumor to initiate angiogenesis , but not enough time for it to grow significantly . If physicians could catch such small tumors in humans , the chance of a complete cure would be high . <p> After a dose of anesthetic , each rabbit was placed in a 1.5-tesla MRI chamber and imaged six times : 30 minutes before dosage , immediately after , then 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120 minutes after . To quantify any image enhancement , the team used the predosage image as a baseline . <p> At first , the targeted and control groups showed similar enhancement , which the WUSTL team attributes to the leakiness of the blood vessels around the tumors . But by two hours , as more and more nanoparticles stuck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit an average enhancement of 125% . <p> The competitive blockade group had the lowest enhancement . As Lanza and Wickline anticipated , the first wave of targeted , uncovered particles stuck to the sites of angiogenesis and partially blocked access for the second wave of targeted covered particles . Under the microscope <p> Figure 2 shows a typical MRI image from one of the rabbits in the targeted group . In this example , the patches of enhanced contrast appear on the edges of the tumor . In other examples , patches appear close to , but not on , the tumor , as if the tumor were in the process of establishing a vascular bridge . <p> To confirm that the patches correspond to angiogenesis , the researchers cut out the tumors , then stained , sliced , and examined them under the microscope  --  a process called histology . The histology provided confirmation . <p> Proving that targeted nanoparticles can locate and stick to the sites of angiogenesis is important not only for diagnosing cancer , but also for potential therapies . In 1971 , Harvard University 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n3 ) Now , several angiogenesis inhibitors , among them the drugs endostatin and angiostatin , are in clinical trials . And last year , David Cheresh of Scripps and his collaborators showed that integrin-targeted nanoparticles can deliver therapeutic genes to cancer cells. ( n4 ) <p> Testing any anticancer drug involves assessing its effect on tumors . Targeted nanoparticles could do the job without the need for a biopsy . And they do n't need MRI . Lanza points out that PFOB is twice as dense as water , which makes it an x-ray contrast agent , and has a sound speed one third that of water , which makes it an ultrasound contrast agent , too . Not bad for salad dressing . <p> Figure 1 . Targeted nanoparticles , shown in schematic cross section , contain liquid perfluorooctylbromide encased in a functional lipid skin . <p> Figure 2 .
