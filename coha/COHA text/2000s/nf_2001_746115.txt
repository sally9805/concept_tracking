It is fashionable to beat up on Ed schools these days , to accuse them of a multitude of sins , even to suggest that they should be " blown up . " <p> Let us forbear from extreme statements . Let us recognize that Ed schools are probably here to stay . And let us focus on their most important failings and how these might be rectified or circumvented . <p> I detect five shortcomings more worrisome than the others . <p> First , Ed schools typically do not teach teachers ( or administrators ) the things those people most need to know to be effective in their jobs . For teachers , what is most needed is deep knowledge of the content of the subjects they are responsible for imparting to their pupils , plus practical ways of delivering that knowledge in classroom settings and practical techniques of classroom management . <p> Ed schools do not do a good job of teaching these things to future teachers because the institutions do not value them . As Public Agenda reported in Different Drummers , their professors do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as much as they prize the latest fad or ideological dispute. 1 Their primary accrediting body does not value these things . And in many states , the teacher-certification requirements with which they must comply do not value these things , either . <p> Future principals do not learn what they need to , either , while passing through a typical Ed-school-based administrator-training program . More and more , the principal of a U.S. school needs to function like a corporate CEO , with responsibility for personnel , budget , mission , external relations , and so forth . But typical administrator-prep programs in education still behave as if the principal 's role were some combination of building manager and dean of instruction . Though the job has elements of those roles , the main skills it calls for today are more akin to those imparted by top-notch graduate business schools than by Ed schools . <p> Second , what they do teach often can not be trusted . It rests on a shaky scientific base-the central fallacy of the medical school analogy so beloved of Ed school apologists-and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ideologies than in rigorous research . Moreover , much of what is known with scientific certainty gets ignored or downplayed in Ed school courses . Hence the persistence , for example , of " whole language " methods for future primary teachers of reading , even though several decades of solid research have established a firm consensus that phonics-based approaches work far better for most children . <p> Third , of the nearly 1,400 programs of teacher education in the U.S. today , most have low or nonexistent standards . I refer to standards for admission , standards for completing individual courses and other segments of the program , and standards for exit . As with all such generalizations , one can find happy exceptions , often in private liberal-arts colleges and research universities , but the programs that produce most U.S. teachers are , essentially , open-admission , low-challenge , no-fault , easy-exit programs . This is particularly troubling when one understands that the state has , effectively , ceded to the university the decisions about which candidates are ready to teach . Sure , there may be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criterion for state certification is whether the candidate has completed an " approved program . " Completion of said program thus hinges on faculty judgments . In my own experience , it is not unusual for the faculty-being non-judgmental , student centered and relativistic , like all of today 's fashionable educators-to give automatic A 's to everyone who enrolls in their courses . So much for quality control . <p> Fourth , there is amazingly little evidence that the graduates of such programs are any more effective in K-12 classrooms than those who never went through the " approved " training . This is a stunning thing to contemplate . It is akin to saying that medical school graduates are no better at curing sick people than are random PhDs in comparative literature or sociology . But in education it appears to be true . Research can be mustered on the comparative effectiveness of regular Ed school graduates versus those who are " alternatively certified , " and for the most part the unconventional teachers are at least as effective . So , too , are teachers in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all-and never went near an Ed school . They , however , often turn out to be better educated in the broad sense , more likely to have majored in the subject that they are teaching . <p> Fifth , Ed schools are part of the cartel that restricts entry into public-school teaching in America , seeks to force everyone through essentially the same homogenized preparation program in ever more alike institutions , and defies common sense about how to attract talented people and run effective organizations . This cartel has many elements , including state certification offices , teacher unions , and such ubiquitous outfits as the National Council on Accreditation of Teacher Education ( NCATE ) , the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards ( NBPTS ) , the National Commission on Teaching and America 's Future ( NCTAF ) , the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education ( AACTE ) and the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium ( INTASC ) . The cartel is doing its utmost to close loopholes and tighten entry into teaching , at the very time some reformers-myself included-think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . <p> That quintet of problems , by and large , is growing worse as the cartel grows more powerful-and as its cockeyed paradigm for strengthening teacher quality gains influence at the state and federal levels . I can not overstate the seriousness of this : the dominant formula for teacher reform in America today amounts to ingesting the hair of the dog that bit us . The cartel would have us take all these dysfunctional arrangements and give them even more of a monopoly . <p> Understand , though , that the cartel works primarily through public policy , through laws and regulations , particularly at the state level . It is state law , the regulations promulgated by state departments of education and state boards of education ( and so-called " independent " teacher professional licensing boards ) , and state-managed procedures for approving preparation programs and certifying individuals , that bestow power and authority upon the cartel and thus sanction its paradigm . Washington reinforces all this through its funding programs and its " recognition " of accrediting bodies , but most of the action is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed if government did not invest it with virtual hegemony . And that , in turn , is why I do not believe the " Ed school problem " can be solved by universities alone but must be tackled through public policy and politics . <p> The main point of leverage is teacher certification . As a recent paper by the late David Angus shows beyond dispute , gaining control over entry into teaching has been a longstanding goal of the education profession and since the early days of the twentieth century the profession has worked assiduously to bend state policy to assist it in that campaign. 2 The serious matter of who is fit to teach in America 's public schools has been shouldered by the state and then , in effect , delegated to the profession . Not to individual schools . Not to local communities ( though they may select among state-certified candidates ) . Certainly not to parents . No , all this is now deeply rooted in government policy . If state certification were not a prerequisite for public-school teaching posts and if state certification had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems would be far easier to solve . <p> The premier policy challenge is to be found in the intersection of two sets of rules . One set says that an individual desiring to teach in the state 's public schools must complete an approved program of teacher preparation ( and not much else ) . The other says that the state will do the approving of programs . <p> Then conduct this thought experiment . Imagine a regime in which state approval of preparation programs were based on a pluralistic conception of what makes a good teacher rather than a uniform and prescriptive one . Imagine a regime that gauged a teacher 's fitness by the academic value that she adds to her pupils rather than by transcripts and paper credentials . And imagine one in which essentially any individual may teach so long as a school-which , after all , is accountable for its results-wants to hire her for that purpose . <p> Nowhere in America is all this happening today , though one can catch glimpses of how it would work by looking at the personnel practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Teach for America , and by gazing at states with relatively well developed " alternative certification " programs , such as Texas and New Jersey . <p> What would happen if all these pieces were assembled and tried on a sizable scale , such as an entire state ? We can not be sure , of course , precisely because that has never been done . But it would be a relatively low-risk experiment , considering the lackluster quality of many of today 's entering teachers and the promising signs in some precincts that individual pieces of this alternative arrangement are working well . <p> No , I do not suggest that all fifty states should abruptly impose this new regime on all their schools . I urge , though , that various forms of it be tried-and carefully evaluated-and that state policymakers think twice before submitting to the hyper-regulatory regime being pressed upon them by various organizations whose first name is " national . " <p> The key to this alternative approach is decentralization of personnel decisions to the school level , this freedom to be accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gauged primarily by the academic value that a school adds to its pupils . <p> That is how most high-performance organizations work today : tight about ends , loose as to means . They have thrown out the thick old manuals of procedure and have radically trimmed the middle management that formerly kept everyone running uniformly ( if inefficiently and unproductively ) . Instead , they have conferred both authority and responsibility upon each production unit , which has considerable freedom to make its own decisions so long as it contributes sufficiently to the bottom line . <p> Private and charter schools work that way , too . It is time to bring conventional public schools into the twenty-first century , as well . <p> What would happen to Ed schools ? Under the regime I am suggesting , people would matriculate in them if they felt that doing so would make them more effective or enhance their job prospects . In other words , Ed schools would become more like journalism schools or social-work schools : optional , not compulsory , and responsive to market forces in their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV station today , we find some staff members who went to journalism school and some who did not . And we find journalism schools having to persuade people that , in fact , they deliver knowledge and skills that have value in a real world free from government-enforced cartels . <p> Good Ed schools would thrive . Bad ones would lack students . And would-be and veteran teachers and administrators would seek valuable knowledge and skills from many places , including but not limited to Ed schools . <p> In such a world , a good teacher is no longer judged by paper credentials or peer impressions but by the value she adds to her students . In such a world , a good school is not one full of " certified " teachers but one that causes its pupils to gain at least a year 's worth of academic skills and knowledge during every school year . In such a world , the school picks its own teaching team , deploys and compensates them as it sees fit , rearranges them when it judges that this will produce better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they are effective . <p> A school , in other words , behaves like a normal organization that is concerned about productivity , performance , and customer satisfaction . And our education policies come to treat teachers much as today 's **28;1390;TOOLONG strategy treats schools : accountable for their results but otherwise free . <p> The state does not entirely vanish . It continues to set the standards of knowledge and skill that students and schools are measured against ; it runs the main assessment system ; and it ensures that the accountability system confers suitable rewards and interventions . With respect to teachers and others in direct contact with children , it conducts background checks to make sure they are not criminals or child molesters and do not have tuberculosis . Most likely-though this is controversial-it tests them to make sure that they possess the relevant subject matter knowledge and to make it unnecessary for each school to do this on its own . <p> But that is about it . The state otherwise steps back . The cartel loses its teeth . And the Ed schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the value that they add to those who voluntarily attend them . <p> No , I am not sure it will work better . But I do not think it could work worse . And I know it is worth trying . <p>
