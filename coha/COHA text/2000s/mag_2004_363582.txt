Just because the weather outside is frightful , that 's no excuse for slacking off on your physical activity . With much of the U.S. in a deep freeze , however , this is probably a good time to review the rules for exercising in cold weather . <P> 1 . DRESS IN LAYERS The greatest danger is hypothermia , a condition in which the body 's core temperature drops from 98.6F to below 96F . Sports doctors recommend that you wear an inner layer made of a material , such as polypropylene , that wicks away moisture so that your perspiration does n't chill your body . ( Do n't use cotton , which retains moisture against the skin . ) Choose something like fleece or wool for your middle , insulating layer , and make sure your outer layer protects against the wind . <P> 2 . GET A BUDDY It 's easier to recognize the signs of hypothermia  --  confusion , trouble speaking or walking  --  in someone else than in yourself . <P> 3 . WATCH OUT FOR FROSTBITE The nose , ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be covered . If the temperature drops low enough or the wind is fierce enough , frostbite can develop on the corneas of the eyes as well , says Dr. William Roberts , president-elect of the American College of Sports Medicine . Men whose pants are too flimsy  --  or who insist on wearing just shorts  --  can develop a very painful condition known as testicular nip . Watch out too for earrings , nose rings and any other metal object that conducts cold right to the skin . <P> 4 . DRINK LIQUIDS Just because it 's winter does n't mean you do n't sweat  --  or breathe out a lot of moisture . If you 're outdoors for more than an hour , take water or a sports drink with you . Avoid caffeine which , besides being a diuretic , will tax your already stressed-out cardiovascular systemand alcohol , which opens up the blood vessels in your limbs , causing you to lose heat from your core . <P> 5 . STRETCH Do it both before and after you exercise . This is especially important in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> 6 . KNOW YOUR LIMITS Pay someone else to shovel the sidewalk if you have a heart condition . Cold air can be particularly hard on your lungs if you have asthma , but it can also trigger problems in folks who do n't . Wearing a scarf or mask will reduce the amount of cold air going into your lungs . Call your doctor if you cough a lot and develop shortness of breath after exercising . " Minus 10 is not that bad if you 're dressed for it and are used to it , " says Dr. Roberts . <P> Of course , he 's from Minnesota . Whatever your comfort zone , do n't forget that there is always an alternative : just go indoors to exercise at a mall , at a gym or in your basement . Remember , spring is only nine weeks away .
