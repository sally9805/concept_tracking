<p> BASEL , Switzerland  --  When activists dumped a pile of genetically engineered corn at its headquarters here , Novartis quickly turned the protest into public relations grist . <p> The pharmaceutical and biotech giant trucked in cows from outlying dairy farms to clean up the mess . The sight of the animals grazing amid the city 's trams and office towers was irresistible to the Swiss media , which gobbled up the story as fast as the cows could munch the grain . <p> That 's the full extent of Novartis ' public relations derring-do these days . Europe 's battle-weary biotech firms have hunkered down until the public furor over bio-engineered crops blows over . They have halted public-image advertising , mothballed applications for regulatory approvals and focused on researching genetic advances that wo n't come to market for five to seven years . But as they wait out the storm , many are horrified by signs that Europe 's biotech backlash may be spreading to the USA . <p> " What 's happening in your country ? " asks an incredulous Arthur Einsele , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketer of bio-engineered seed . <p> Until now , Europe 's biotech industry has viewed the USA as an island of sanity in the debate about the safety of genetically modified ( GM ) foods . The U.S. government has OK 'd far more varieties of biotech crops than any other country  --  more than 30 vs. only nine in the 15-nation European Union . U.S. and Canadian farmers last year planted 81 million acres of bio-engineered seed , which accounted for 47% of the U.S. soybean harvest and 37% of the U.S. corn crop . GM ingredients are contained in hundreds of grocery items , from salad dressing and soft drinks to tortilla chips and cooking oil . <p> European biotech firms , meanwhile , have had to cope with threats and vandalism from anti-biotech radicals , along with a regulatory stonewall that has blocked their products from both field and food store . Public outcry over biotech foods has prompted thousands of European supermarkets to remove them . Share prices of industry leaders such as Novartis have been pummeled . <p> " We thought you already had this debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Einsele says . <p> The U.S. biotech industry suddenly faces : <p> * Protests . Opponents costumed as mutant ears of corn took to the streets last month in Seattle , where they and other protesters disrupted the World Trade Organization summit . Other noisy demonstrations took place last fall at U.S. Food and Drug Administration hearings on biotech foods in Washington , D.C. , Chicago and Oakland . <p> Environmental and consumer groups fighting bio-engineered foods have recruited Hollywood celebrities such as Jane Seymour and Roseanne to the cause . <p> * Washington scrutiny . This spring , Congress is likely to consider a bill to require mandatory labeling of foods that contain GM ingredients . Labeling is required in the EU , but the labeling issue has split U.S. biotech firms and others close to them . Many U.S. supermarket chains quietly favor labels ; most farm groups and food manufacturers oppose the idea . <p> Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Monday the federal government wants consumers to have more details about bio-foods but is unlikely to require labels . <p> * Farmers ' uncertainty . U.S. farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , despite heavy lobbying and discounting by Monsanto , DuPont and other seed companies . Most say they still believe in GM seeds but worry about their ability to sell their grain or keep conventional and GM crops separated , as some buyers have asked . <p> European farmers , many of whom want to try GM crops , understand the predicament of their American counterparts . <p> " You have to follow the tide , and the tide is completely against GM crops , " says French farmer Xavier Beulin . " It 's not a rational issue . " <p> * Finicky customers . Japanese trading companies are the biggest foreign buyers of U.S. soybeans , which are used to make tofu . They have quietly shifted suppliers to ensure that they get non-GM beans . <p> Similarly , European food retailers and farm cooperatives are shunning biotech corn and soybeans when they buy in the USA . U.S. officials say EU buyers ' insistence on non-GM corn cost American farmers an estimated $ 200 million in lost sales in 1999 , a figure certain to grow this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wild Oats Markets , the USA 's two largest natural-foods retailers , want manufacturers of their private-label foods to stop using GM ingredients . Observers are watching to see if any mainstream supermarkets follow suit . <p> * Wall Street scorn . Shares of many biotech firms have taken a beating . Shares in St. Louis-based Monsanto traded as high as $ 50 13/16 last March . Wednesday 's close : $ 36 3/16 . <p> Investors in the biotech sector expected a quick payoff from the technology , but have been spooked by anti-biotech activism , regulatory inertia and negative publicity , says Jay Hickman , analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston . <p> Investor pessimism has forced big players to consider spinning off or selling their seed and crop-protection businesses . <p> Last month , Novartis and Anglo-Swedish concern AstraZeneca announced plans to merge and spin off their agriculture operations . In the USA , Monsanto and Pharmacia &; Upjohn took a similar approach last month in announcing their marriage . Their combined agriculture business is quickly being distanced from core pharmaceutical and life sciences operations : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its shares will be issued in a public offering . <p> Behind Europe 's backlashEuropean mistrust of GM foods is largely a reaction to events of the past decade , particularly Britain 's Mad Cow disease and last year 's dioxin chicken and Coca-Cola scares in Belgium . Health officials were slow to react and initially understated the risks to the public . <p> There are other factors . Many of Europe 's anti-biotech " greens " hold public office and are well placed to influence policy . And European supermarket chains have tight control over the supply chain  --  dictating farming methods and food-manufacturing specifications . <p> U.S. officials are furious with European regulators for ducking the GM issue . The EU has resorted to " a variety of ploys and political maneuvers to delay and deny " approval of GM products because it ca n't find scientific grounds to reject them , Commerce Undersecretary David Aaron told European officials last fall . <p> He said a decade of U.S. experience shows biotech foods are as safe as those made with conventional ingredients . <p> There has been " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Aaron said . " There is simply no evidence to the contrary . " <p> That 's a story the U.S. biotech industry is eager to tell . It is mounting an expensive image campaign , reaching out to scientists , food retailers , regulators , Congress and anti-biotech activists . U.S. seed companies are holding town-hall meetings with farmers and financing independent scientific research into crop genetics . <p> In Europe , the approach is different . Novartis , AstraZeneca and others have made a strategic decision to wait for perceptions to change gradually . They are taking small steps  --  opening their research labs to the public , for instance  --  but are exerting little public pressure on regulators to untangle the approval process . They 're banking on products with clear consumer benefits  --  better taste , more nutritional value , disease-fighting capabilities  --  to change public opinion . <p> " We see this as a very , very long game , " says Nigel Poole , external relations chief at Zeneca Agrochemicals , a division of AstraZeneca , until he retired last month .
