Last September , if you lived in Maryland , North Carolina or Virginia and the biggest , baddest storm since 1999 's Hurricane Floyd was bearing down on your homeport , there was only so much you could do to save your boat . In most cases , that meant tying down anything that could be tied down , storing the remainder and hoping for the best . Jimmy Weir of Virginia Beach , Va. , thought he had Hurricane Isabel beat . Instead of merely throwing a few extra lines on his 21-foot Carolina Skiff and 25-foot Sea Fox , he had them hauled and dry-stacked at Jordan Point Marina near Hopewell , Va. , 100 miles inland up the James River , four days before the tempest struck . But on September 18 , he still lost both boats when a nine-foot storm surge lifted them  --  along with about 100 other pleasure craft lining the shore on stands and blocks  --  and dropped them 200 yards from the waterfront in a mass of broken fiberglass and twisted metal . " I could n't believe my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . There were three piles of boats and boat pieces and parts pouring out of the complex and onto the highway . Words do n't do it justice , " Weir said . " I live on the coast in Virginia Beach , so I figured things would be a lot worse there than 100 miles up the river . Boy , was I wrong . " Sandy Joseph , an employee at Jordan Point Marina , shared Weir 's disbelief in the aftermath of Isabel 's fury . " We did n't feel that we were going to get the damage that we did , " she said . " The marina was totally destroyed . The gas pumps , the rigging shack and the yacht club are gone . The ship 's store , which is a two-story building , has been condemned . All the boats ended up stacked like cordwood . " Isabel was a Category 2 hurricane when it hit North Carolina 's Outer Banks early on that Thursday afternoon , shortly before high tide . It brought with it 105-mph winds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea level more than 10 feet above normal . Piers were splintered . Roofs were ripped from homes and tossed around like Frisbees . Trees were toppled onto power lines and buildings . Roads were left underwater , cutting off access to the rest of the world . The barrier islands were given face-lifts , with inlets and beaches moved or completely washed away . By the time Isabel hit the mainland , it had been downgraded to a tropical storm , but that was n't much consolation to the people and things in its path . Gale-force winds and flooding inundated the shoreline as far north as Wilmington , Del. , and as far south as Wilmington , N.C. President Bush declared Federal disaster areas in Virginia , North Carolina , Delaware and Washington , D.C. More than 3.3 million residents were left without power for several days after the storm , and at least 40 deaths have been attributed to Isabel and its aftermath . For Mid-Atlantic boaters , Hurricane Isabel hit especially hard , in spite of the precautions many of them took when the storm was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Va . According to BoatU.S. , total losses to pleasure craft will exceed $150 million , with most of the boats affected located in the upper Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River watersheds . Here , a combination of wind-driven storm surge and high tide was exacerbated by record rainfall runoff , catching many boaters by surprise with unprecedented high water . " The sheer number of vessels in this area resulted in one of the largest economic losses to recreational boaters from any catastrophe , including Hurricane Andrew , " said Carroll Robertson , BoatU.S. vice president of marine insurance . Jim Baugh of Richmond , Va. , producer and host of the TV fishing show " Jim Baugh Outdoors , " was ready for the high water when Isabel turned its eye his way . It was not the first hurricane he had weathered  --  he endured Gloria , Fran and Floyd in ' 85 , ' 96 and ' 99 , respectively  --  but it was " definitely the worst storm that our region has seen in possibly 100 years , " he said . " A big key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Find a secure harbor with a good marina and good docks , and keep the boat well tied with enough line for the expected height of the storm surge . " On September 18 , Baugh and his cameraman , Sean Finnegan , were holed up at the Radisson Hotel in Hampton , Va. , babysitting their 28-foot Pursuit and 36-foot Trojan at Customs House Marina , one of two homeports where they keep the boats . Days prior , they 'd had the Pursuit hauled , dry-stacked and anchored down well out of harm 's way . The Trojan stayed in the water at the fixed dock behind the Radisson . " We had 25 lines tied to the Trojan , most of them new . We budgeted for a 10-foot surge and a 100-mph blow , " he said . " At mid-afternoon , we stood on the lee side of the Radisson and watched the marina go five feet under water . All we could see were the boats . At that point , there was n't much we could do but pray . " Water swamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel , but then stopped . When the flood finally receded to the top of the dock hours later , Baugh and Finnegan went out and readjusted their lines . " The Trojan was fine . There was only minor damage to a few boats in the marina that were tied on the outside dock next to the channel , " he said . " And the Pursuit made it through without a scratch . " Through his most recent brush with potential disaster , Baugh has learned some important lessons regarding hurricane preparedness . " There are many things to consider . For instance , keep all boats full of gas . Make preparations to live without power for several days . Keep plenty of batteries and flashlights on hand , and pre-wash a lot of clothes and towels , " he posted on his Web site , www.jimbaughoutdoors.com . " Should your boat be trailerable , move it someplace safe , which does n't mean next to your house , where it 's subject to high winds and falling trees . And always consider the storm surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars worth of damage caused by Isabel , things could have been worse . Thankfully , advances in storm modeling have allowed NOAA to extend its hurricane forecasts from three to five days , providing critical time to get ready for those in the danger zone . Initial damage investigations by BoatU.S. reported effective storm preparation among boaters . " Those who took advantage of the long lead time by either removing their boat , or adding extra lines , chafe protection and buttoning down tightly , generally faired OK , " said Robertson . " While we 've seen many total losses , much more of the vessel damage is minor , such as scrapes , dinged rubrails or torn canvas . And with any storm , this kind of damage is to be expected . " Still , preparations will only go so far if a hurricane is powerful enough  --  and Mother Nature is unpredictable . Some areas in Isabel 's path were inexplicably spared , while in other places , severe damage to pleasure craft and boat yards did occur . Nautical Boats , a 100-boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 900-foot fixed piers , and about 20 vessels went to the bottom of the Elizabeth River . " There was n't much we could do . We got hit head-on , " said owner Harvey Williams . But a day after the storm , marina patrons began arriving to restore the facility . Williams , it seems , had made a habit of keeping his fees low for " middle-class " owners and was always quick to help out a client whenever and however he could , often for nothing more than a " thank you . " Now it was payback time . Though it required a lot of gritty work , Nautical Boats ' patrons were determined to repair the marina they call home . By press time , they had jacked up about 240 feet at the end of pier B and muscled it back in place . Pier A , where damage was far worse , would be next . " I 'm sitting here looking at a wreck of a 900-foot pier , and my patrons are putting it back together , " Williams said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people right , it comes back . " And as for Jimmy Weir , it turns out he was among the lucky , too . Though his 25-foot Sea Fox was piled among the ruins of 20- to 50-foot boats at Jordan Point Marina , it could be salvaged and fixed with a minimum of out-of-pocket expenses . " Despite initial appearances , most of the damage was cosmetic . I 'm working with my insurance company and the marina right now to get the repairs done , " he said . " Which is great because I 've only made two payments on the boat . " Illustration <p>
