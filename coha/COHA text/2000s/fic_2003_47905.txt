Crime and Punishment <p> VENTUALLY IT CAME TO PASS that no one ever had to die , unless they were so horrible that society had to dispose of them . Other than the occasional horrible person , the world was in an idyllic state , everyone living as long as they wanted to , doing what they wanted to do . <p> This is how things got back to normal . <p> People gained immortality by making copies of themselves , farlies , which were kept in safe places and updated periodically . So if you got run over by a truck or hit by a meteorite , your farlie would sense this and automatically pop out and take over , after prudently making a farlie of itself . Upon that temporary death , you would lose only the weeks or months that had gone by since your last update . <p> That made it difficult to deal with criminals . If someone was so horrible that society had to hang or shoot or electrocute or inject him to death , his farlie would crop up somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , and go off on another rampage . If you put him in jail for the rest of his life , he would eventually die , but then his evil farlie would leap out , full of youthful vigor and nasty intent . <p> Ultimately , if society felt you were too horrible to live , it would take preemptive action : check out your farlie and destroy it first . If it could be found . Really bad people became adept at hiding their farlies . Inevitably , people who were really good at being really bad became master criminals . It was that , or die forever . There were only a few dozen of them , but they moved through the world like neutrinos : effortless , unstoppable , invisible . One of them was a man named Bad Billy Beerbreath . He started the ultimate crime wave . <p> There were Farlie Centers where you would go to update your farlie - one hundred of them , all over the world - and that 's where almost everybody kept their farlies stored . But you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough liquid nitrogen and terabytes of storage and kept them in a cool dry place out of direct sunlight . <p> Most people did n't know this ; in fact , it was forbidden knowledge . Nobody knew how to make Farlie Centers anymore , either . They were all built during the lifetime of Joao Farlie , who had wandered off with the blueprints after deciding not to make a copy of himself , himself . <p> Bad Billy Beerbreath decided to make it his business to trash Farlie Centers . In its way , this was worse than murder , because if a client died before he or she found out about it , and had n't been able to make a new farlie ( which took weeks ) - he or she would die for real , kaput , out of the picture . It was a crime beyond crime . Just thinking about this gave Bad Billy an acute pleasure akin to a hundred orgasms . <p> Because there were a hundred Bad Billy Beerbreaths . <p> In preparation for his crime wave , Bad Billy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stored them in cool dry places out of direct sunlight , all around the world . On 13 May 2999 , all but one of those farlies jump-started itself and went out to destroy the nearest Farlie Center . <p> By noon , GMT , police and militia all over the world had captured or killed or subdued every copy ( but one ) of Bad Billy , but by noon every single Farlie Center in the world had been leveled , save the one in Akron , Ohio . <p> The only people left who had farlies were people who had a reason to keep them in a secret place . Master criminals like Billy . Pals of Billy . They all were waiting at Akron , and held off the authorities for months , by making farlie after farlie of themselves , like broomsticks in a Disney cartoon , sending most of them out to die , or " die , " defending the place , until there were so many of them the walls were bulging . Then they sent out word that they wanted to negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled en masse , destroying the last Farlie Center behind them . <p> They were a powerful force , a hundred thousand hardened criminals united in their contempt for people like you and me , and in their loyalty to Bad Billy Beerbreath . Somewhat giddy , not to say insane , in their triumph after having destroyed every Farlie Center , they went on to destroy every jail and prison and courthouse . That did cut their numbers down considerably , since most of them only had ten or twenty farlies tucked away , but it also reduced drastically the number of police , not to mention the number of people willing to take up policing as a profession , since once somebody killed you twice , you had to stay dead . <p> By New Year 's Eve , A.D. 3000 , the criminals were in charge of the whole world . <p> Again . <p>
