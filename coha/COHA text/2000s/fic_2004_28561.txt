Chapter One Dear Mr. Anders : It is our duty at this time to inform you of the death of Marcus McCoy due to an unfortunate , unforeseen encounter with a grizzly bear while fly-fishing in Alaska on June 8 of this year , and per the stipulations set forth in his last will and testament , to make formal his acknowledgment of one Cooper Anders , age 30 , of 785 Westmark Street , Dependable , Missouri , as being his son and heir to an equal portion of his estate . It is the wish of Joseph McCoy , father to Marcus McCoy , grandfather to Cooper Anders and founder of McCoy Enterprises , that you immediately assume your rightful place in the family home and business with all due haste and utmost discretion to preserve the family 's privacy . Regards , David Weidman , Esq . Weidman , Biddermier , Stark Cooper rocked back on the heels of his black work boots , the air stalled in his lungs . Shock nearly made him plop right down on the concrete county-jail steps . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-morning sky , then thought better of it and dropped his gaze to the space between his feet . Marcus McCoy , you son of a - " Mr. Anders ? " The gorgeous , petite brunette who 'd handed him the letter drew his attention , a touching concern sharp in her bright green eyes . " Are you all right ? You were n't hurt during the , er , altercation last night , were you ? " He waved off her worry and his reaction to it . " No . No one laid a hand on me . " " But I thought you 'd been arrested for involvement in a bar fight . " Cooper snorted . " I mostly just sat on the biggest guy so it 'd be a fair fight . " He raised the letter and his brows . " So this is why you bailed me out of the klink ? You were sent by them ? " She smiled as if they were a good thing , showing white teeth to match the rest of the pretty package . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curves beneath her brown sweater and beige slacks , he snorted again . Seemed it was a snorting kind of morning . " So much for a favorite male fantasy coming true . " A frown marred her smooth forehead . " Excuse me ? " " You know , the one about being sprung from jail to become some babe 's cabana boy ? " She blinked , then her eyes widened and splotches of red spread over her high cheekbones . On any other day he would have tried for a full-body blush . On any other day he would have sworn this day would never come . He looked back down at the inarguably official letter . Adrenaline surged and his heart started to pound . He had n't had a clue how to deal with the news of Marcus 's death when he 'd first heard of it on the news a few days ago . Now he did . " Though an altogether different fantasy of mine is about to come true . " " I can imagine . " Something in her tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her smile implied he 'd simply reassured her . She probably was n't the only person in town who 'd think that suddenly becoming a part of the Mc-Coy family would be a dream come true . But for a very different reason from his . Appearances could be so deceiving . He eyed her glossy brown hair , cut so the ends flipped up just as it reached her slender shoulders , her subtle makeup , her lack of jewelry other than a tiny gold anchor on a necklace and her business-casual outfit . Her appearance , though extremely attractive , screamed corporate drone . He seriously doubted anything deceptive was going on with her . He nodded at the letter . " So you are aware of what this says ? " She cleared her throat . " Yes , actually , I am . " She folded her hands in front of her , all professional-like , but her discomfort sneaked through in the way she held her neck stiff and her gaze darted from his to the letter and back . A strong sense of kinship stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like to be caught after doing something he should n't have . " I admire your honesty . " But since he 'd yet to completely shake the habit of acting how he was expected to in this town , he once again let his interest roam over the conservative sweater and slacks that failed to hide the curves underneath . " Among other things . " She made a soft , strangled sound that brought his attention to her wide eyes . She must not get out much . He kicked up a corner of his mouth and shrugged . " I suppose you ca n't be blamed for taking a peek , since they did n't bother to seal the envelope . And I doubt the vaunted McCoys bail people out of the slammer on a regular basis . That would get anyone 's curiosity up . " Her sculpted dark eyebrows came down and she shook her head . Her nicely formed lips , accented with a subtle brownish lipstick , opened to protest . He raised his hand to stop her . " No big deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him would have just as soon kissed her . She was so his type . Great eyes , hair , shapely , and roughly his age . A woman who 'd know how and still consider it fun . ' Cause fun was all he was ever after , thanks to what his mother had experienced . " But you do n't understand - " " Unfortunately , I understand perfectly . " He stopped her once more , and gestured at her with the letter . " The McCoys send a pretty piece of fluff - a secretary with an eye on moving up , I bet - to be sure I 'd realize just how lucky I am , on the off chance that being told out of the blue that I 'm a member of one of the richest families in the country is n't enough . " He winked and smiled tightly . " No offense , of course . " Obviously offended , anyway , she pulled her chin back and her frown deepened into a scowl . " First of all , please do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her tone confirmed it . ( Continues ... )
