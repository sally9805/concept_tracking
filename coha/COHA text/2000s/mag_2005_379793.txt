Chances are your shirt , your pants and your underwear all came from southern China , the new manufacturing center of the world . Add one more export : your flu virus . With its dense populations of people and animals trading germs back and forth , southern China has been the traditional birthplace of influenza , including the nasty strain of H5N1 bird flu that 's keeping public-health officials awake at night . The viruses that evolve in a chicken in southern China 's Guangdong province could eventually end up in your lungs  --  and that 's what makes a chain-smoking , impetuous Chinese virologist named Dr. Guan Yi so important . <P> Guan , 43 , who was born in mainland China but is chiefly based at the University of Hong Kong , is a human early-warning system in the shifting viral landscape of southern China and now southeast Asia , where bird flu has been endemic since the end of 2003 . Although Beijing is traditionally secretive about disease within its borders , Guan 's network of mainland Chinese contacts and his secondary position at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological samples from more than 100,000 birds in the region over the past five years , more than any other scientist . It 's hard , dirty work  --  every day researchers pick through less than hygienic live poultry markets , persuading traders to allow them to take blood and feces samples from their chickens and waterfowl . From those samples , Guan and his team have managed to sequence the genetic code for more than 250 strains of H5N1  --  giving them a chillingly accurate picture of how widespread bird flu is in the region and how the virus is mutating . " We have to know what 's in animals , so we know what could be in human beings , " says Guan . <P> He knows from experience how important that is . It was Guan who discovered , through field data he gathered , that civet cats were probably spreading the SARS virus to human beings . Guan formulated his hypothesis just as SARS was beginning to return in Guangdong at the start of 2004 . A more patient scientist might have waited and harvested more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with new human cases surfacing , there was n't time . Putting his scientific reputation on the line , he gave his preliminary results to authorities in Guangdong and urged them to cull civets being sold in wild-animal markets . After some hesitation , they did  --  and since then , the only new SARS cases have come from a handful of lab accidents . " My personal effort stopped the second SARS outbreak , " Guan says . " And hopefully my personal effort will contribute to saving the world from this pandemic . " <P> Guan does n't lack for scientific chutzpah , but it takes a little self-confidence to rise from Jiangxi Medical College in the heartland of China , where Guan earned his M.D. at age 21 , to a corner office in Hong Kong and a position as one of the most important influenza experts in the world . As we inch closer to a possible flu pandemic , Guan keeps gathering his data , doing his part to piece together the puzzle that is the avian flu . " I do this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time , human beings have the ability to prevent a pandemic . How many lives will we save ? " And how much time do we have left ?
