In the original film of Mel Brooks ' The Producers , Zero Mostel advises a blithering Gene Wilder , who has just unintentionally observed Mostel 's character trying to seduce an elderly woman : " You mean ' oops , ' do n't you ? Just say ' oops ' and get out ! " Yet sometimes even " oops " is not enough . <P> Kenneth Adelman and Richard Perle said " oops " earlier this month . As personality types , these two longtime Washington hawks could n't be more different . Adelman is relentlessly cheerful and upbeat , while Perle is legendarily gloomy and dark . But both played a role in pushing the U.S. into war in Iraq  --  Adelman in an influential Washington Post Op-Ed promising that the war would be " a cakewalk " and Perle warning of catastrophe if we left Saddam Hussein and his weapons unmolested . Now , interviewed in Vanity Fair , they say it all may have been a mistake . Oops ! <P> Yet in Vanity Fair 's quotes , there is no note of contrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensing with Saddam , establishing peace and democracy in Iraq and then watching those ideals spread throughout the Middle East is still a good idea . It 's just that President George W. Bush bungled the job . Among other things , he failed to recognize the degree of " disloyalty " within his Administration , says Perle  --  who was chairman of Bush 's Defense Policy Board  --  thus proving the accusation even as he makes it . <P> Opponents of the Iraq war ought to be happy for two such prominent converts . So why is their conversion so enraging ? Well , first , howzabout an apology ? It 's maddening that there 's no cost for being wrong , even when it translates into thousands of people dead and billions of dollars down the drain . In our culture of value-free celebrity , in which a famous ax murderer equals a famous actress equals a famous Nobel Peace Prize winner , Adelman and Perle have merely earned another 15 minutes as hot guests on the talk shows . They have reason to be pleased , having deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they should try not to show their pleasure . <P> Second , you do n't get to assume the success of your intentions then plead a shrugging " Who knew ? " when they do n't pan out . I also am in favor of toppling dictators , establishing democracy and watching it spread painlessly throughout every region where there is no experience of it . Not only that : I am in favor of turning sand into ice cream and guaranteeing a cone to every child in the Middle East . But you ca n't turn sand into ice cream . That is not a defect in the execution of the idea . It is a defect in the idea itself . Although Perle and Adelman and others may think they are dissing the Bush Administration when they talk about its incompetence in failing to turn sand into ice cream , they are also displaying the Bush Administration 's key vice , which is assuming that things are how you wish them to be and not how they are . <P> Third , condemning Bush 's conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who do n't want to support the war but ca n't bring themselves to say it was wrong . This would include almost every Democratic candidate in last week 's midterm elections . What would these Monday-morning quarterbacks have done differently ? Sent in more American troops ? Puh-leeze.
