Section : DEMO <p> The Internet made our computers infinitely more handy and versatile . Neil Gershenfeld at the MIT Media Lab says our buildings are next . <p> Neil Gershenfeld thinks every light switch , power outlet , doorknob and thermostat should be on the Internet . That way , says the director of the MIT Media Lab 's new Center for Bits and Atoms , everything from climate control to security could be coordinated through a single Web-based interface . Such a system would simplify both construction and building management by doing away with the separate , incompatible control technologies currently needed to keep a large building comfortable and safe . What 's more , he says , embedding computing power in all a building 's systems and components could offer unprecedented flexibility and efficiency . Reconfiguring an office space , for example , would no longer mean an expensive and time-consuming rewiring job ; switches , light fixtures and other components could be moved around on power tracks and reprogrammed at will . But there 's a catch . " The Internet , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch and outlet , " Gershenfeld says . Standard networking technology is too expensive and complicated for such massive deployment . So Gershenfeld 's team is developing cheap , simple Internet devices able to network themselves with a minimum of human intervention . Technology Review senior editor Rebecca Zacks got a look at the technology in Gershenfeld 's lab , where he demonstrated a whole new way to turn on the lights . SIMPLE SITE . At the heart of Gershenfeld 's system is a fleet of small , cheap computing devices . " This is an Internet site , " says Gershenfeld , picking up one of the devices and pointing to its small green-and-black circuit board . This particular device , he adds , is also a switch ; it boasts two buttons , one white and one black , mounted with the circuit board on a large white base . " All of this stuff plugs into a track , " Gershenfeld says , grasping the base . " It 's like a track for track lighting , but it 's unusual because it has two extra wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The tracks are already commercially available , he says , and could be installed throughout a building . The switch itself is built with off-the-shelf components , including a very simple microprocessor . All told , " this might be a couple dollars ' worth of parts , " he says . PLUGGED IN . Gershenfeld snaps the switch into a track set up on a desktop , positioning it between two similar devices of different size . Gershenfeld gestures to the device on the right-hand end of the track : " This is also an Internet site , but this one is n't a switch-it 's an AC outlet . " In fact , a desktop lamp is plugged into the outlet , though the lamp is currently off . A small green light glows on the switch Gershenfeld has just added to the track , indicating that the device is drawing power from the track . But when he pushes the buttons on top of the switch , trying first the white one and then the black one , " nothing happens because this switch has no life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ndash ; 4 . PROGRAMMING TOOL . Gershenfeld sets out to remedy the situation . " I 'm going to take a sophisticated programming implement , a pair of tweezers , and I 'm going to introduce the switch to the outlet , " he says . " It does n't have to be tweezers . That 's just what we happen to have around the lab . " He touches the tips of the tweezers to tiny metal pads on the front of the switch , then to identical pads on the outlet device . " What happens when I do that , " he explains , " is the switch sends a message to the network that says , Hello , world , Neil just did something to me . ' The outlet sends a message back , saying , Oh , Neil did something to me too . ' " As Gershenfeld wields the tweezers , a nearby oscilloscope monitors data traffic on the track . " And then they say , Well , if he did it to me and then he did it to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So then they exchange over the network the equivalent of their business cards . One says , I 'm an AC outlet , here 's my address on the network , ' and the other one says Oh , I 'm switch , here 's my address on the network . ' " This digital conversation is represented visually by a forest of red spikes flashing on the oscilloscope 's screen . LIGHTS ON . Now that the switch and the outlet have exchanged their data , Gershenfeld says , " if I push the switch , the light turns on and off . " He pushes the white and black buttons and the lamp responds accordingly . " And I can take the switch out and plug it in somewhere else , and it still does the same thing , because the behavior 's associated with the switch , not the location of the switch . " What 's more , he says , each switch can easily be reprogrammed to control a different outlet ( or thermostat , electric door lock , and so forth ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , where traditionally " a lot of work goes into making drawings of wiring of what gets connected where . Then a lot of work goes into following those diagrams , and then , if you get all of that right , a lot of work goes into eventually changing it when the dot com goes bust and you need to rearrange the building . " EVERYTHING ONLINE . The system also opens the possibility of controlling all of a building 's systems via the Internet . " This is the Internet , " Gershenfeld says , plugging a yellow cord into the left-most device on the track . That device , he explains , converts the signal coming through into a lower-bandwidth format that runs on the track . He picks up a personal digital assistant and wirelessly connects to a very simple Web page that says " Off . " With a tap of the stylus , the page switches to " On , " and the lamp turns on . " What 's happening is the PDA is sending a message out through a radio to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the socket , and it tells the socket to turn on and off " - bypassing the physical switch entirely . GET REAL . The Media Lab 's new building , planned to open in 2004 , will give the system its first large-scale test-going way beyond light switches and , with the aid of corporate sponsors , moving toward a commercial version of the technology . Gershenfeld opens a circuit box , revealing a jumble of wires and devices that represents early efforts to marry conventional heating , cooling and ventilation technology with Internet-based sensors , thermostats and switches . " The expectation is that in the run up to the building 's opening all sorts of stuff will break , " pointing the way toward refinements , he says . " The building is a chance to show that the stuff can work on a grand scale , not just as a little toy demo . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 1 . SIMPLE SITE . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 2 .
