<p> PALO ALTO , Calif.  --  The brazen attacks on some of the biggest consumer Web sites have inconvenienced millions of customers , frustrated companies and sparked a hunt for the hackers , but authorities concede that the perpetrators might never be found . <p> The FBI 's computer investigations chief , Ron Dick , said the series of assaults on Web sites could be the work of anyone , even a 15-year-old with access to the right software . Even if the saboteurs are located , security experts warn , copycat attacks are possible in the days ahead because there is nothing to prevent others from launching similar assaults . The stakes could get higher if hackers start demanding money in exchange for agreeing not to cripple a site . <p> " The next step will be threats and extortion , " says Tim Belcher of RIPTech , a security firm that has advised the Justice Department . <p> For now , hackers are hitting sites with " denial of service " attacks , a technique in which vandals flood a Web site with traffic and overload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enabling an explosion of electronic commerce and fueling the expansion of the economy , comes at a cost : vulnerability to attack . <p> Though the attacks did not compromise data , they are taking a toll on consumer confidence and some companies ' bottom lines . <p> Most companies declined to say how much the outages at their Web sites cost them . But a report on electronic commerce released today hints at it . Forrester Research estimates that Amazon.com , which was down for about an hour , would lose $ 4.5 million in sales if its site crashed for 24 hours . Yahoo , which was down about three hours , would lose $ 1.6 million a day . Dell Computer would lose $ 35 million , Intel $ 33 million and Cisco Systems $ 30 million a day . <p> " Clearly , anytime you shut down a business , it will have a huge revenue impact , " says Carl Howe , research director at Forrester . <p> A shutdown also scares away customers ; 58% of first-time customers told Forrester that they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks of these companies also are at risk . In general , stocks of companies with a reported crash or breach of security on their site fall an average of 3.9% the day following the attack , according to a USA TODAY analysis of 16 cases . Though the companies usually bounce back , Internet investors should n't expect such a mild response after this week 's attacks , says Jim Marks of CS First Boston . " This is something different . " <p> The assaults are panicking dot-com companies , which are racing to secure their sites . But security experts say there is n't much that Web companies can do . " Denial of service attacks are the easiest to launch and the hardest to prevent , " Belcher says . <p> Sites are defenseless <p> The attacks come from computers that are broken into by hackers , who plant software and then instruct the computer to send tons of traffic to a particular Web site . Yahoo says it was attacked by 50 computers ; Buy.com was bombarded by computers in three cities . <p> Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once one hits , the only choice a site has is to reroute traffic to a different part of the network until it becomes overwhelmed or shut the site down . <p> If there is a solution , it rests with Internet service providers and other institutions . <p> Industry watchers say ISPs , whose routers take you to the site ( a host of servers ) you 're logging onto , could install filters to weed out mock traffic that is generated by an attacking computer . But ISPs are loath to do this because it can slow the speed of their networks by 20% . <p> On the front end , companies , universities and other institutions with large computer systems could install security measures that prevent hackers from gaining a launch pad for their attacks in the first place , security experts say . " If hackers ca n't gain access to large computers , they ca n't launch denial of service attacks , " John Vranesevich of AntiOnline says . <p> Digital ' footprints ' <p> Such attacks are easy to carry out and make the culprit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type use intermediary sites , and while they may be able to track back . . . there 's very little likelihood of there still being records of the activity , " says Gene Spafford , computer science professor at Purdue University . <p> To find the hackers , law enforcement agents must first find the computers used in the attack and then look for digital " footprints " that could help identify the perpetrator . <p> " It 's like looking for a needle in a haystack , " says Patrick Taylor , vice president of Internet Security Systems in Atlanta . Authorities must work with ISPs , which keep lists of traffic , and try to trace the traffic back to a particular router and computer . If they find the computers , it 's possible to go in and find the source code planted by the hacker . That code might contain clues  --  such as references to a group or signature types of code  - -  that could lead to the perpetrator . <p> Dick of the FBI said at least four field offices are involved in the probe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an attempt to track back to " the person behind the keyboard . " <p> The trail could lead investigators overseas to a hacker or group of hackers using remote connections to launch assaults from " unwitting " third parties , Dick said , based on previous investigations . There were no reports of similar attacks late Wednesday , but he declined to characterize the situation as " under control . " <p> Besides looking for physical evidence , authorities probably are compiling a profile of the hackers . Vranesevich , whose company has a database of 7,200 hackers , says the culprit is probably a group of people in their teens or early 20s that has infiltrated 75 to 100 computers . <p> Former FBI behavioral analyst Clint Van Zandt says the hacker profile might be similar to the graffiti vandals who roamed southern California . <p> " These are people willing to get out on the edge and challenge authority , " Van Zandt said . " Like taggers , hackers leave their mark and dare you to track them down . " <p> Others suggest a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dot-coms . " Somebody may do it to a business competitor , " or it may be a disgruntled customer or employee , says Scott Charney , who served nine years as chief of the Justice Department 's computer crime unit . <p> Sobering reality <p> Whatever the motive for the attacks , they come as a rude awakening to dot-coms and consumers who have begun to use the Net for everyday business and view it as a safe , reliable medium . Security experts warn that companies will suffer more blows as hackers begin trying to poke holes in the Internet and profit from some of the marquee sites . <p> Companies are taking notice . Global Center , which hosts Yahoo 's and others ' Web sites , is installing filtering technology to keep out fake Internet traffic . E-Trade says it will hold a postmortem to learn how " to strengthen our efforts to deal with this , " spokesman Patrick Di Chiro says . " It 's a constant ongoing effort to stay several steps ahead of people who would do this kind of thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question we 're being asked is ' What can we do to minimize the impact ? ' " says Cal Slemp of IBM Global Services . <p> The hacker scare also had another upside : It sent investors scurrying to buy shares of companies that help secure Web sites . Shares of Watchguard Technologies , which makes firewalls that stop hackers from taking control of servers , jumped 46% to $ 49 1/8 . Security gear maker Axent jumped 22% to $ 28 1/4 , and RSA Security soared 20% to 63 47/64 . <p> Contributing : Kevin Johnson , Kevin Maney , Matt Krantz , Edward Iwata and M.J. Zuckerman
