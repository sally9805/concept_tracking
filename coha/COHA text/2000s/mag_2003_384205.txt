He waves his wand , and 2 weeks worth of vacation vaporize into a can of film . So find time to spend with your kids while you can . Study after study has shown that children who feel connected to their families tend to be happier , get better grades , and are less likely to drink , smoke , or do drugs . Here are 12 easy ways for you and yours to get connected . 1 . Declare War <p> Next time the family 's at each other 's throats , put on some old clothes and " step outside "  --  with a bunch of aluminum pie pans and cans of whipped cream . Make heaping cream pies , and smack each other in the kisser with them . ( Easy , now ! ) Diffuse any leftover stress with a good water-balloon dousing. 2 . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop the squirming when you and the kids are forced to stand in a long line . But one of these play-anywhere games will . <p> Kooky Connections : Two people each silently choose a word and then say it aloud simultaneously  --  the quirkier the word pair , the better . A third person connects them in a sentence . For example , if the words are cow and chandelier , the sentence might be " The chandelier fell and turned the cow into burgers ! " <p> Firsts &; Lasts : Choose a category , such as geography , animals , or foods . One person names an item in that category ; the next names another that begins with the last letter of the previous item . For example , apple leads to eggplant , then leads to taco , oatmeal , lemon , and so on . Try coming up with an item for every letter in the alphabet before switching categories . 3 . Make Backyard the Base Camp <p> It delivers the best of both worlds : the great outdoors , safe and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard is a low-stakes introduction to the adventure of spending the night outside ; for teens , it 's a chaperoned sleepover that wo n't trash the house .

In season , catch a jar of ladybugs or fireflies , then set them free . 4 . Break All the Rules <p> Research shows that the family that plays together , stays together .

Take turns drawing cards , and allow either player to move as the card says , depending on who it helps the most or hurts the least . Try to get both players to the Candy Castle before the timer goes off . 5 . Go Scavenger Cycling <p> Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The environment 's teeming with natural jewels  --  flowers , leaves , rocks , sticks , and seashells are all fair game .
