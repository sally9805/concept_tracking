// THERE IS SOMETHING FABLE-LIKE , ALMOST LEGENDARY , ABOUT the story of Tom Rippon 's emergence as a distinctive American ceramic sculptor . Born in Sacramento , California , in 1954 , Rippon lost his beloved mother when he was nine . " My sister and I raised each other , " , he recalls , and from a young age , he learned to rely on his own wits , leaving the family home by the time he turned 16 . Yet Rippon also found himself the beneficiary of extraordinary kindnesses from family members and mentors , who sensed in the boy not only need , but exceptional talent . Clay came early into Rippon 's life , in the person of an aunt , Ruth Rippon , a ceramic sculptor whose distinguished career includes 30 years of teaching ( 1956-87 ) at California State University , Sacramento . Though her work falls within the tradition of classical humanism , certain of her sculptural tableaux project a surreal atmosphere , perhaps a seminal influence on Tom 's mature oeuvre . From age six onward , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruth did all the glazing and firing of her nephew 's work , but soon she taught him the range of skills needed to realize his own ceramic visions . Other childhood influences included a " little Mexican marionette " acquired on a family trip to Tijuana . Rippon loved the fact that the figure , with its articulated joints , moved at his command . Movement and the figure always fascinated him , and his earliest aspiration was to be a film animator . He conjured up his own cartoon characters and created flip-books that brought them leaping to life . Like many boys , he built plastic models , but instead of cars or planes , he chose figures to construct - pop culture icons like Godzilla . By the time he entered high school , Tom was helping his art teacher to fire kilns and even co-teaching night classes in exchange for materials and a key to the school building . At 16 , the prodigy began to exhibit his sculptures- " simple little constructions based on sea anemone forms " - at the Candy Store Gallery in Folsom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent company , showing with the likes of Robert Arneson , Clayton Bailey , Sandra Shannonhouse and David Gilhooly , prominent figures in the Northern California Funk clay scene . The Candy Store also exhibited Funk painters Roy DeForest and Maija and David Zack , together with leading members of the Hairy Who from Chicago . Arneson , the ringleader and acknowledged master of the Funk movement , soon took Rippon under his wing . When Arneson invited him to informally pursue his ceramics education at the University of California , Davis , Rippon jumped at the chance . In the late 1960s and early 70s , Arneson ran the Davis clay program as a " loose , unstructured teaching environment . " 2 Rippon 's arrangement at Davis must have been the loosest , most unstructured of all . Arneson provided him with a " little place to work , a corner in a hallway , " and hired the teenager to take care of his four sons . Never enrolling in the university , Rippon stayed at Davis for fouryears . " Those were different times , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . But I learned so much . " Bob Arneson , " Rippon remembers , " could cut you like a knife with a few words . That 's all it took to get you working and thinking . " Telling Rippon that he had fallen into a creative rut , Arneson soon had his apprentice exploring new forms , including his first human figures , " very small and abstract . " " I was so young I did n't know how to think critically . Bob taught me what art 's all about-conceptually . " And , crucially , the elder ceramist introduced Rippon to the possibilities and pleasures of using art historical references in his work . One day Arneson told him , " Your time is up , " and the young ceramist left Davis behind . He continued to develop his sculptural vocabulary , focusing more and more on playful explorations of the human figure . His work brought him increasing notice , and in 1975 , at the age Of 21 , he had his first solo exhibition , at Helen Drutt Gallery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Midwest-with his friend Richard Notkin , whom he 'd met at UC Davis - Rippon found himself at the Art Institute of Chicago . Invited to accept a teaching post , he revealed that he had never received an undergraduate degree . Despite his lack of credentials , the School of the Art Institute offered him a place in its Master of Fine Arts program , together with a teaching assistantship . Rippon took the offer , and in 1979 he was awarded his M.F.A. " I went to the Art Institute as much for the Chicago experience as for the school itself , " Rippon confesses . At the Candy Store Gallery he 'd been introduced to the hard-edge paintings of the Hairy Who , Chicago Imagists like Karl Wirsum , jim Nutt and Gladys Nilsson . " I loved their work , " he said , " the starkness , the intense colors , the rough subject matter , frightening and sexual . " Many of those qualities entered Rippon 's work , but he would use them to his own ends and " much more subtly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State University , Bozeman , and California State University before spending most of the 1980s teaching at Tennessee Technological Institute , Cookeville , and the University of Nevada , Reno . In 1989 he joined the faculty at the Universityof Montana , Missoula , where he remains , serving as chair of the art department from 1990 to 1996 . By the mid 1980s , Rippon had arrived at the sculptural approach he continues today . Although he had studied under the master of Funk , his work-like that of several other Arneson students , including Notkin and Richard Shaw- partakes more of the " fetish finish " style that emerged in Los Angeles during the early 1960s and of the 70s " super object " movement , with its obsessive craftsmanship , appropriation of Surrealist and Dadaist strategies , and trompe l'oeil effects . From an early age , Rippon has boldly experimented with his materials , never worrying too much about ceramic conventions . Rather than working with wet clay , he finds that he can achieve the effects he desires by manipulating dry clay , treating it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to achieve a satin-smooth surface . His works are assemblages , the various parts joined together with steel rods and pins . His dancing figures , though articulated , only imply movement ; he prefers , as he says , to " control the dance . " Color is central to Rippon 's work , and through experimentation , he has come upon techniques that render his colors particularly vivid . As a , teenager , he applied low-fire lusters to his work without first glazing the porcelain . Without the clear glaze , he did not get the " oil slick " look characteristic of lusters , but instead , happily , achieved what Nancy Bless has called " an unusual silky iridescence that coheres his color range . " 3 He also applies to his surfaces " impure " colorants like acrylics , colored pencils and pigmented epoxies . In choosing his subject matter and his forms , too , Rippon has followed his own path . Unlike the Funk artists , who were drawn to the public realm of savage satire and political statement , Rippon found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material of daily life . Marionettes , cartoons , pop culture : all influence and inform the sculptural explorations of his maturity . And these populist influences render his work , despite its sophisticated allusiveness , approachable , even seductive . And then , after he brings the viewer close-to savor the tasty colors of his lusters , the goofy postures and tendril-like limbs of his goddesses and brides , the offkilter charm of his tableaux- he springs the trap of meaning . What is Domestic Mourning ? And why does it took so cheerful ? Why are the figures of his Unseen Ballet dressed entirely in black , gray and white , the garb of grief ? Why do his teapot lids take on the form of women 's heads , flamboyant and coquettish ? What about the recurrence of game boards and fragments of Italian architecture ? And isthere something to these obsessions with sports figures and musicians and objects of domesticity ? As with the best poems , the questions posed by these segmented constructions of porcelain and steel pins have many answers-none definitive . Provisional , open-ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments by early modernists . Following Arneson 's advice , Rippon found-and continues to make brilliant use of-the art historical images that inflame his imagination : Giorgio De Chirico 's paintings from his Mannequins series , images like The Disquieting Muses , Hector and Andromoche , and The Seer(Rippon 's The Seer , 1987 , isa direct homage ) ; the biomorphic forms that populate paintings by Dali , Miro and Tanguy ; the eroticized dolls of the Surrealist Hans Bellmer ; and the marionettes of the Bauhaus master Oskar Schlemmer ( Rippon 's Unseen Ballet series represents an unabashed tribute to the costumes for Schlemmer 's Triadic Ballet ) . The modernists ' fascination with the mannequin , the marionette , the robot , the doll represented-at the start of the 2oth century-a deeply ambivalent response to the ever-increasing influence of science and technology on the human enterprise . This fascination was alternately utopian and pessimistic . The Russian Constructivist El Lissitzsky designed a geometric " new man , " happily reconstructing , in Peter Conrad 's words , man 's " soft , padded , lazy body , reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamscapes , peopled by mute mannequins , De Chirico admitted to painting " the melancholy of beautiful autumn days , afternoons in Italian cities . " De Chirico 's melancholy , argues Guy Davenport , was a common response to a " new world born in the dynamo and the internal combustion engine , butout ofwhich the early modernists did not know what kind of soul " might emerge.5 Today Rippon 's marionettes reflect less anxiety than their modernist predecessors . And they are scarcely melancholy . Despite the dire history ofthe recently departed century and the challenges of his own life , Rippon stands on the side of the optimists . Perhaps he believes , with Heinrich von Kleist-the German Romantic whose 1810 essay , On the Marionette Theatre , profoundly influenced Schlemmer and Bellmer-that " we shall find grace at its purest in a body that is entirely devoid of consciousness or which possesses it in an infinite degree ; that is , in the marionette or the god . " 6 Tom Rippon 's perpetually dancing figures and animated still lifes , watched over by a benevolent creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joyous but grieving and , ultimately , grace-filled vision of the world .
