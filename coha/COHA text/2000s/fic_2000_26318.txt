Chapter One Predators Her body moved with the frankness that comes from solitary habits . But solitude is only a human presumption . Every quiet step is thunder to beetle life underfoot ; every choice is a world made new for the chosen . All secrets are witnessed . If someone in this forest had been watching her'a man with a gun , for instance , hiding inside a copse of leafy beech trees'he would have noticed how quickly she moved up the path and how direly she scowled at the ground ahead of her feet . He would have judged her an angry woman on the trail of something hateful . He would have been wrong . She was frustrated , it 's true , to be following tracks in the mud she could n't identify . She was used to being sure . But if she 'd troubled to inspect her own mind on this humid , sunlit morning , she would have declared herself happy . She loved the air after a hard rain , and the way a forest of dripping leaves fills itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her body was free to follow its own rules : a long-legged gait too fast for companionship , unself-conscious squats in the path where she needed to touch broken foliage , a braid of hair nearly as thick as her forearm falling over her shoulder to sweep the ground whenever she bent down . Her limbs rejoiced to be outdoors again , out of her tiny cabin whose log walls had grown furry and overbearing during the long spring rains . The frown was pure concentration , nothing more . Two years alone had given her a blind person 's indifference to the look on her own face . All morning the animal trail had led her uphill , ascending the mountain , skirting a rhododendron slick , and now climbing into an old-growth forest whose steepness had spared it from ever being logged . But even here , where a good oak-hickory canopy sheltered the ridge top , last night 's rain had pounded through hard enough to obscure the tracks . She knew the animal 's size from the path it had left through the glossy undergrowth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . It could be what she 'd been looking for these two years and more . This lifetime . But to know for sure she needed details , especially the faint claw mark beyond the toe pad that distinguishes canid from feline . That would be the first thing to vanish in a hard rain , so it was n't going to appear to her now , however hard she looked . Now it would take more than tracks , and on this sweet , damp morning at the beginning of the world , that was fine with her . She could be a patient tracker . Eventually the animal would give itself away with a mound of scat ( which might have dissolved in the rain , too ) or something else , some sign particular to its species . A bear will leave claw marks on trees and even bite the bark sometimes , though this was no bear . It was the size of a German shepherd , but no house pet , either . The dog that had laid this trail , if dog it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out in such a rain . She found a spot where it had circled a chestnut stump , probably for scent marking . She studied the stump : an old giant , raggedly rotting its way backward into the ground since its death by ax or blight . Toadstools dotted the humus at its base , tiny ones , brilliant orange , with delicately ridged caps like open parasols . The downpour would have obliterated such fragile things ; these must have popped up in the few hours since the rain stopped'after the animal was here , then . Inspired by its ammonia . She studied the ground for a long time , unconscious of the elegant length of her nose and chin in profile , unaware of her left hand moving near her face to disperse a cloud of gnats and push stray hair out of her eyes . She squatted , steadied herself by placing her fingertips in the moss at the foot of the stump , and pressed her face to the musky old wood . Inhaled . " Cat , " she said softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a good surprise to find evidence of a territorial bobcat on this ridge . The mix of forests and wetlands in these mountains could be excellent core habitat for cats , but she knew they mostly kept to the limestone river cliffs along the Virginia-Kentucky border . And yet here one was . It explained the cries she 'd heard two nights ago , icy shrieks in the rain , like a woman 's screaming . She 'd been sure it was a bobcat but still lost sleep over it . No human could fail to be moved by such human-sounding anguish . Remembering it now gave her a shiver as she balanced her weight on her toes and pushed herself back upright to her feet . And there he stood , looking straight at her . He was dressed in boots and camouflage and carried a pack larger than hers . His rifle was no joke'a thirty-thirty , it looked like . Surprise must have stormed all over her face before she thought to arrange it for human inspection . It happened , that she ran into hunters up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had stolen her advantage'he 'd seen inside her . " Eddie Bondo , " is what he 'd said , touching his hat brim , though it took her a moment to work this out . " What ? " " That 's my name . " " Good Lord , " she said , able to breathe out finally . " I did n't ask your name . " " You needed to know it , though . " Cocky , she thought . Or cocked , rather . Like a rifle , ready to go off . " What would I need your name for ? You fixing to give me a story I 'll want to tell later ? " she asked quietly . It was a tactic learned from her father , and the way of mountain people in general'to be quiet when most agitated . " That I ca n't say . But I wo n't bite . " He grinned'apologetically , it seemed . He was very much younger than she . His left hand reached up to his shoulder , fingertips just brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I do n't shoot girls . " " Well . Wonderful news . " Bite , he 'd said , with the northerner 's clipped i . An outsider , intruding on this place like kudzu vines . He was not very tall but deeply muscular in the way that shows up through a man 's clothing , in his wrists and neck and posture : a build so accustomed to work that it seems tensed even when at ease . He said , " You sniff stumps , I see . " " I do . " " You got a good reason for that ? " " Yep . " " You going to tell me what it is ? " " Nope . " Another pause . She watched his hands , but what pulled on her was the dark green glint of his eyes . He observed her acutely , seeming to evaluate her hill-inflected vowels for the secrets behind her " yep " and " nope . " His grin turned down on the corners instead of up , asking a curved parenthetical question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more compelling combination of features on any man she 'd ever seen . " You 're not much of a talker , " he said . " Most girls I know , they 'll yap half the day about something they have n't done yet and might not get around to . " " Well , then . I 'm not most girls you know ... "
