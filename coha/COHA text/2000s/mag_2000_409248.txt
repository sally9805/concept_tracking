I should have known better ; it was December in Vermont , after all , and I had no business chopping at the half-frozen ground . Suddenly my prized old onion hoe was useless . And even though it was the simplest of tools-narrow blade , straight neck , long wooden handle-I knew I would have a hard time replacing it at any local store . Who stocks hoes in December in Vermont ? Nobody . So I decided to turn to the Internet . You might think that the Net and the garden are incompatible . After all , for many of us the garden is where time slows to a pace in tune with nature-a place we go to escape fax machines , e-mail and the World Wide Web . Surprisingly , though , gardening sites have taken vigorous root on the Internet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , as the manager of CompuServe 's now defunct Garden Forum , I first started cyber-gardening . These days you can find everything from discounted seeds and plants to tools and garden advice . When shopping for garden supplies , baby boomers usually turn to upscale boutiques like Smith &; Hawken ( www.smithandhawken . COM ) or Gardener 's Supply Co . ( WWW.gardeners.com ) . Both of them are known for high-quality tools and environmentally friendly supplies , so that 's where I started . A search for " hoe " on the Smith &; Hawken site turned up 48 items , but none ended up being something you could use to whack at weeds . Further clicking failed to locate what I was looking for . Much the same thing happened at Gardener 's Supply . Like my local hardware store , these sites had apparently put their hoes in storage . It looked as if I 'd have to weed out some of the more obvious choices to find the best sites . Here 's what I found : The one-stop shopping site www.garden.com With over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online gardening world . No matter what time of year it is , you can find just about anything that 's even vaguely connected with the garden , including , of course , seeds , plants and cut flowers but also oddities like AstroTurf coasters . As one of the few Internet-born garden-goods companies , Garden.com. offers all the bells and whistles that a good postmillennium site should . This is n't necessarily a good thing : It took me quite a while to find the hoes , not because of a slow search engine , but because I was distracted by all the eye-catching interactive features . That said , some of them are useful , fun or both . I found , for example , lots of timely-albeit rudimentary-gardening tips targeted to my region . ( Oops-time to mulch the perennials ! ) I could have also checked out some photos of the site 's pick for garden of the month or chatted with other gardeners , but the feature I could n't resist was the online garden-design software , which enables you to enter your growing conditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results were on the simplistic side , but beginners would find them usefulin any case , the exercise was a lot of fun . Once I finally got down to business , the site 's search engine turned up 17 hoes . Unfortunately , none of them were the simple onion hoe on which my heart was set . The closest thing was the half-moon hoe at $39.95 plus $6.79 shipping-more than I had really intended to pay . As a matter of fact , prices at Garden.com tend to be a bit higher than at other , more single-minded sites . That said , I have ordered from Garden.com in the past and always found the service outstanding and the shipping fast and inexpensive . The price leader for gear www.amleo.com You wo n't find good-looking models , fancy graphics or nifty interactive features , but for the best prices and selection on gardening tools and accessories , it 's hard to beat A.M. Leonard . The search engine works well only if you already know the product code number . But when I clicked directly on the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoe entries , each accompanied by a clear photo and a good description of the item , including its size and weight . I quickly found an onion hoe just like the one I broke , priced at $25.21 . Instead , I could have bought a replacement handle for $18 and attached it myself . But I went for the whole hoe , paid $795 for shipping and had it in hand within a week . Top plant discounter **27;1209;TOOLONG Though Garden.com offers a good selection of small plants , most gardeners I know prefer to shop around for the best price before buying . I 'm no different , and I usually wind up making most of my plant purchases from Bluestone , which offers a large selection of popular perennials , sold in packs of young seedlings , at deep discounts . Bluestone 's website is even better than its excellent print catalogue . You can search by plant name or let the site select plants based on your climate , soil type and color and height preferences . When I entered my zip code and requested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly sunny location , I was rewarded with a list of more than a dozen possibilities . I chose Rudbeckia " Goldsturm , " the Perennial Plant Association 's 1999 plant of the year . The price : $8.50 for three plants , plus $6.70 shipping . The shrub and bush specialist www.whiteflowerfarm.com For larger , more developed plants , as well as rosebushes , shrubs and even some trees , White Flower Farm is your best bet . Prices are on the high side but , given the quality , reasonable . For the most part , the site replicates the company 's extensive catalogue . But it also recommends plant combinations and provides links to general information . The site also excels at keeping up with what 's hot in the garden by offering the latest hybrids and passing along recent pronouncements by trend-spotting experts . The seed superstore www.johnnyseeds.com There are scores of online seed companies , but Johnny 's Selected Seeds is the best all-around site , combining great service and selection , useful information and competitive prices . The site merges the content of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can browse by category-flower , vegetable or herb seeds or gardening accessories-or run a search by variety or brand name . You 'll find a large selection of standards such as tomatoes , cucumbers , carrots and marigolds , as well as more unusual crops like mesclun , that trendy mix of salad greens . ( Johnny 's offers two mesclun mixes , mild or spicy , at a reasonable $3.40 a packet or $9.95 an ounce . ) Johnny 's is also the only site I found that promises to ship all orders within 48 hours year round . And it offers an excellent array of online fact sheets with , for example , detailed instructions on how to plant and harvest mesclun . The specialty seed boutique www.cooksgarden.com Johnny 's goes well beyond standard Big Boy tomatoes , but the best source for specialty seeds is Cook 's Garden . You 'll find a better selection of mesclun mixes , for example ( it offers seven , including tangy , mild , garnish and classic European , for $2.50 a packet or $7.50 an ounce ) as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's is also one of the few companies to offer a good selection of reliable organic seeds .
