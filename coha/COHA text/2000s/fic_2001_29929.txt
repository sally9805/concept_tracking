" IT IS NEVER wise to become emotionally involved with a client , " Vesta Briggs said . " I 'm not involved with Mack Easton . " Cady cradled the phone against her shoulder and tugged off first one high heel and then the other . " Not in the way you mean . I 'm just consulting for him . I thought I made that clear . " There was a short , terse silence on the other end of the line . Cady sighed silently and sank down onto the sofa . The phone had been ringing a moment ago when she had come through the door . She had lunged for it on the off chance that it was Fantasy Man . It had not been Mack Easton . It had been her great-aunt . " There 's something in your voice when you talk about him , " Vesta said . Icicles of disapproval hung on each word . " I get the impression that you are interested in him in a personal way . " " He 's just a voice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she heard it , a thrill of awareness zinged through each nerve ending . Her vivid imagination did the rest , conjuring blatantly erotic fantasies out of thin air . It was a voice that had begun to whisper in her dreams but she saw no reason to mention that to her rigid great-aunt . Vesta Briggs was not a romantic . Cady slipped off one silver earring and set it down on the glass-topped coffee table . Probably not a good idea to tell Vesta that in addition to being a voice on the phone , Easton had also become a frequent e-mail correspondent , she thought . He seemed to enjoy locating arcane bits and piecesof information relating to the art world on-line and forwarding them on to her . Lately , she could have sworn that he had begun to flirt with her via computer . She saved all of his on-line correspondence in a special folder labeled " Fantasy Man . " She had gotten into the habit of checking her computer first thing each morning to see if he had paid her an on-line visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " obsessive " to describe her new routine , but she was aware that some people might view it as a tad compulsive . Of course , if there was anyone who would understand obsession , it was Vesta , she thought . She glanced at the row of family photographs arranged on one wall . Her gaze fell on the woman with dark hair and enigmatic eyes . It had been taken some fifty years ago when her great-aunt was in her thirties , shortly after she had founded Gallery Chatelaine . There was a withdrawn , remote quality about the image . Vesta looked as if she was listening to a conversation that only she could hear , one that had taken place in the distant past . As far as anyone knew , the only thing Vesta had ever cared about was Chatelaine 's . There had been no room in her life for love or marriage or children . For five decades she had single-handedly controlled the fate of the business she had created . With unflinching determination , skill and vision she had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But her lifelong preference for privacy could no longer conceal her growing eccentricities . A lot of people were convinced that Cady took after Vesta . Lately Cady had begun to worry about that possibility herself . It was true that , in spite of Vesta 's austere personality , she had always felt a deep attachment to her . It was n't just because her great-aunt had taught her everything she knew about the art and antiques business . The feeling of unspoken understanding between the two women went deeper . Even as a child Cady had sensed some deep , long-buried pain beneath the layers of protective frost that Vesta wore like an invisible shroud . " Easton is a good client , " Cady said , trying hard to inject reassurance into her words . " What 's more , I 'm really enjoying this end of the business . " " Tracing lost and stolen art and antiques ? " Vesta paused . " I can see why that might appeal to you . You always were more adventurous than Sylvia . " " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatelaine than I ever could , " Cady said quickly . " She thrives on that corporate stuff . " " And you do n't . " Vesta sounded resigned . " No . " Cady settled deeper into the sofa . " I 'm happy with my little art consulting business . I was n't cut out to run a large operation like Chatelaine 's . We both know that . " " You may change your mind someday . " " No. " p This was old territory . It had been well covered after Cady 's divorce three years ago . There was more silence on the line . " Be careful , " Vesta said after a while . " Do n't allow yourself to be seduced by this new client of yours . " " Seduced ? " Cady repeated in a strangled voice , unable to believe what she had heard . Vesta never discussed sex . " I told you , I have n't even met him . " " There is often a great deal of money at stake when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man who requires your expertise to get his hands on that cash can not be trusted . It sounds like your Mr. Easton finds you useful . " " That 's the whole point of my art consulting business . To make myself useful . " " It 's all well and good for a client to find you useful . But do n't let yourself be used . There 's a difference . " " Good grief , Aunt Vesta , it 's not like I 'm having a red-hot affair with the man . " Unfortunately , she added to herself . " Yes , well , that 's enough on the subject of Mack Easton . I did n't call just to discuss him , " Vesta said . " Good . " " I also wanted you to know that I 'm having second thoughts about the wisdom of a merger with Austrey-Post . " Deeply relieved by the change of topic , Cady swung her legs up onto the sofa and leaned back in the corner . " Sylvia told me that you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have n't made a final decision yet but I will soon . " Vesta paused . " I just thought you should know . " " I 'm no longer a member of the board , " Cady reminded her . " I wo n't be voting . " " I 'm aware of that . Nevertheless , I think you should stay informed . " " Sylvia is not a happy camper , " Cady said carefully . " I know . She wants the merger to go through . " " She 's got a vision for the gallery , Aunt Vesta . " " Yes . " " It 's a great vision , one that will make Gallery Chatelaine even more important in the art world than it is already . " " Yes . " There was something in Vesta 's voice that told Cady there was more to the story , but she knew her aunt well enough to know that there was no point pushing for an explanation . Besides , this was Sylvia 's problem . " Did you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . Interesting . " I went to the preview of the Kenner collection , " Cady said . " Oh , yes , that 's right . I remember that you mentioned it . I expect that it was well attended . The sharks of the art world have been circling for years , waiting for Anna Kenner to expire . Her collection of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century decorative arts is one of the finest in the country . " " Well , the good news is that Mrs. Kenner managed to outlive several of the sharks . She was ninety-seven when she died . " " Good for her . I always did like Anna . She bought some of her best pieces from me several years ago . " " Yes , I know . She hired me to consult after I moved here to Santa Barbara . I liked her . " Tonight Anna Kenner 's Santa Barbara mansion had been filled with scavengers dressed in formal attire . They had come to view the lady 's personal possessions in preparation for tomorrow night 's auction . Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Georgian silver , Chinoiserie panels and exquisite furniture she had accumulated in her lifetime . They were anxious to convert her worldly goods into cash as quickly and profitably as possible . The denizens of the art world had been equally eager to help them accomplish that goal . Cady had spent most of the evening standing in an alcove , an untouched flute of champagne in one hand . She had watched the dealers , consultants , museum curators and private collectors prowl through the fine rooms . People had paused here and there to examine carefully arranged groupings of art and antiques and to make inquiries about provenance and value . The auction house representatives , also garbed in somber black and white , had stood discreetly nearby to supply answers and advice . It had all been very civilized and quite elegant with a proper air of hushed solemnity , Cady thought ; but she could not suppress the sense of melancholia that swirled up out of the depths . She ought to know better . The ritual was a familiar one . She had grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was little place for sentiment when it came to the business of auctioning off a valuable collection . But tonight the process of preparing for what was essentially a high-end garage sale had been tinged with sadness . She had a right to brood , she thought . Anna Kenner had been more than a client . She had become a friend . " The good news is that Anna was wined and dined in style during the last few years , " Cady said . " I think she rather enjoyed it . " " I certainly hope so , " Vesta said dryly . " I doubt if there was any expense spared to secure that consignment . " " None . The big auction houses sent people out from New York . The locals also spent a fortune on her . She told me that the courtship began while she was still in her early eighties . Who could know she would live so long ? " Like other wealthy collectors in her position , Anna Kenner had received the royal treatment from dealers , consultants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthdays had been celebrated with elaborate floral arrangements from auction houses . Her evenings had been filled with invitations to lavish gallery openings and museum receptions . As she had once told Cady , her dance card was always full . It was ambulance chasing with class , Cady thought , but it was , nevertheless , ambulance chasing . " Well , it 's getting late , " Vesta said . " I 'm going to take my swim and then go to bed . Good night , Cady . " There was something not quite right here , Cady thought . This was not a typical Vesta phone call . " Aunt Vesta ? " " Yes ? " " Is anything wrong ? " " What makes you think there 's something wrong ? " Vesta asked crisply . Cady winced . " It 's not like you to call without a very specific reason . " " I explained my reasons for calling . I wanted to warn you about getting too cozy with Easton and to let you know that I was reconsidering the merger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger did n't seem to warrant a late-night phone call , Cady thought . But with Vesta you could never be sure of what was going on beneath the surface . She wondered if her aunt was simply lonely . " Aunt Vesta ? " " What is it now ? " " I love you . " There was a short , startled pause on the other end of the line . Cady braced herself . Vesta was not given to sentiment . " I love you too , Cady , " Vesta said . The words sounded stiff and rusty as if she 'd dredged them up from deep underground . Cady was so stunned she nearly fell off the sofa . " We are so much alike , you and I , " Vesta continued . " But I hope things will turn out differently for you . " Cady tried to collect her thoughts . " Differently ? " " I hope you will be happy , " Vesta said with stark simplicity . " Good night , Cady . " The line went dead . Cady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make strange sounds . She hung up the receiver , got to her feet , collected her shoes and went slowly down the hall to her bedroom . There she unzipped the subdued , cowl-necked dress she had worn to the preview . She pulled on a pair of black tights and a leotard and went barefooted down the hall into the living room . She switched on some Mozart and stood quietly for a moment . When she was ready she went slowly through the yoga exercises that she had practiced faithfully since college . It had been suggested by more than one acquaintance that she was a little obsessive about her daily workout . But she was convinced that it was the flowing , stretching movements combined with the deep-breathing techniques that allowed her to control her body 's predisposition toward panic attacks . A predisposition she had inherited from Vesta 's side of the family . She was careful about her routine , but just to be on the safe side , she kept a tiny pill wrapped in tissue inside the small case attached to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little tablet in years , but there was a certain sense of security in knowing that it was available if she ever got overwhelmed by the terrible jitters . She thought about it during that significant pause that occurs between the closing of an elevator 's doors and the first movement of the cab . She visualized it whenever she found herself sitting in an airplane that had been delayed on the ground for an extended period of time . Most of all , she contemplated it whenever someone tried to coax her into going swimming in a lake or the ocean or any other body of water where she could not see beneath the surface . The problem with panic attacks was just one more trait that she shared with Vesta , she thought as she curved into a slow , arching movement that released the tension in her shoulder . She had heard the comments for years . You 're just like your aunt .... You take after your aunt .... You have your aunt 's eye for art and antiques . But she and Vesta were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . To the best of Cady 's knowledge , her eighty-six-year-old aunt had swum almost every day of her adult life . Vesta loved the water . She 'd had a large pool installed on the terrace of her home near Sausalito in Marin County , California . She was especially fond of swimming alone at night in the dark . It occurred to Cady that she was as compulsive about her yoga as Vesta was about her nightly swim . Something else they had in common . Sometimes she wanted to scream in frustration . But there was no denying that the comparisons between herself and her aunt were growing more acute as each year passed . The parallels were getting a little scary . After her infamous nine-day marriage blew up in her face , she 'd heard murmurs to the effect that she had also inherited Vesta 's inability to deal with the male of the species . The words " You 're going to end up just like Aunt Vesta " had taken on new meaning during the past three years . Lately even her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to become concerned . After the divorce they had developed an irritating habit of making polite but increasingly pointed inquiries into Cady 's social life . She unfolded herself from the last exercise and sat cross-legged , gazing out into the night . The strains of a concerto spilled over her and through her , veiling the shadowy spaces that she knew from long experience were better off left unexplored . Genetic inheritances were tough , but nature was n't everything , she reminded herself . Self-determination played a role , too . She was not a Vesta Briggs clone . If she worked hard , she could avoid developing Vesta 's less appealing characteristics . She would not become a self-absorbed loner who surrounded herself with the visible evidence of the past . Damn , she was still brooding , in spite of the Mozart and yoga . Maybe a frozen pizza and a glass of wine would do the trick . What she really needed tonight was a distraction , she thought . Preferably another one of the fascinating , out-of-the-ordinary consulting assignments she had started accepting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past two months , each one more interesting and more intriguing than the last . Mack Easton had tracked her down via the internet . The only thing she knew for certain about him was that he operated a very low-profile on-line business he called Lost and Found . Driven by curiosity , she had tried to research him and his business on-line but the usual search engines had come up empty-handed . You did n't find Mack Easton , apparently . He found you . Easton brokered information related to lost , strayed and stolen art . As far as she could discern , his clients included a wide variety of private collectors , museums and galleries . They all had two things in common : They wanted help tracing and recovering art , antiques or antiquities ; and , for various reasons , they did not want to take their problems to the police . Easton worked by referral only . In his initial phone call , he had explained that he frequently required consulting assistance from experts who had specialized knowledge . That was where Cady came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the realm where exquisite design and functionality intersected . She loved the objects and artifacts of the past that had been crafted with an eye toward both beauty and practicality : Glorious Baroque salt cellars , gleaming seventeenth-century inkwells created by master silversmiths , glowing French tapestries , brilliantly illustrated wall panels and handmade furniturethose were the things that called to her across the centuries . Purists could have their fine art , their paintings and sculpture and the like . She was drawn to art that had been shaped to a useful purpose , art that satisfied the needs of daily life as well as the senses . She closed her eyes and summoned up the mental image she had constructed to go with Easton 's voice . As always , the picture refused to gel . Probably because no man could live up to that fantastic voice , she thought . " It 's all well and good for a client to find you useful . But do n't let yourself be used . " If she had n't known better , Cady thought , she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was impossible . No one used Aunt Vesta . The phone rang , jarring her out of her reverie . She hesitated briefly and then uncoiled to her feet and crossed the crimson carpet . She paused , her hand hovering over the instrument , and listened to the second and third ring . Her parents were in England at the moment , doing research for their next papers in art history . But the fact that they were several thousand miles away did not mean that they were n't calling to ask about her boring love life . She really did not need that conversation tonight . Not after Vesta 's call . The phone rang a fourth time . She could let it go into voice mail . But what if it was Fantasy Man ? The odds were staggeringly not in favor of that possibility , but the slim chance that it was Easton calling with another consulting assignment was sufficient incentive to make her scoop up the phone . " Hello ? " " What do you know about sixteenth-century armor ? " Fantasy Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve ending in her body . Get a grip , woman . He 's probably married . Voices like this one do not stay single for long . Or maybe he 's twenty or thirty years older than you are . So what ? Maturity was a good quality in a man . " Funny you should ask ... , " she said , striving for a businesslike tone . Mentally she crossed her fingers behind her back . Okay , so arms and armor were n't her favorite examples of the decorative arts . Nevertheless , she knew the basics . More importantly , she knew whom to call to bring her up to speed in a hurry . She had connections at some of the best museums and galleries in the country . " I think we should meet to talk about the assignment , " Fantasy Man said . " There are some complications involved . " This was the first time he had ever suggested that they should get together face-to-face . Do n't get too excited , here . It 's just a job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you want to meet ? " " At the clients ' place of business . " She seized a pen . " Where is it ? " " Las Vegas , " Fantasy Man said . " Place called Military World . A small museum that features reproductions of arms and armor from the medieval period to the present . Does a big gift shop business . " " Reproductions ? " she repeated carefully . Her initial enthusiasm evaporated instantly . Reality returned with a dull thud . Military World sounded like a tacky , low-rent souvenir operation . She had professional standards . She did not work for people who collected and sold reproductions . On the other hand , this was Fantasy Man . In spite of Vesta 's warning , she was determined to encourage future assignments with Lost and Found . Sometimes you had to lower your standards a notch . Business was business . " When do you want me in Vegas ? " she asked , pen poised above the pad . " As soon as possible . How about tomorrow morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my schedule , " she said smoothly . " But I seem to recall that I 'm free tomorrow . " And if she was n't free , she would cancel whatever appointments stood in the way of meeting Fantasy Man in person .
