Chapter One Last night at 3:00 a.m . President Kennedy had been killed . Seaman Houston and the other two recruits slept while the first reports traveled around the world . There was one small nightspot on the island , a dilapidated club with big revolving fans in the ceiling and one bar and one pinball game ; the two marines who ran the club had come by to wake them up and tell them what had happened to the President . The two marines sat with the three sailors on the bunks in the Quonset hut for transient enlisted men , watching the air conditioner drip water into a coffee can and drinking beer . The Armed Forces Network from Subic Bay stayed on through the night , broadcasting bulletins about the unfathomable murder . Now it was late in the morning , and Seaman Apprentice William Houston , Jr. , began feeling sober again as he stalked the jungle of Grande Island carrying a borrowed .22-caliber rifle . There were supposed to be some wild boars roaming this island military resort , which was all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how he felt about this country . He just wanted to do some hunting in the jungle . There were supposed to be some wild boars around here . He stepped carefully , thinking about snakes and trying to be quietbecause he wanted to hear any boars before they charged him . He was aware that he was terrifically on edge . From all around came the ten thousand sounds of the jungle , as well as the cries of gulls and the far-off surf , and if he stopped dead and listened a minute , he could hear also the pulse snickering in the heat of his flesh , and the creak of sweat in his ears . If he stayed motionless only another couple of seconds , the bugs found him and whined around his head . He propped the rifle against a stunted banana plant and removed his headband and wrung it out and wiped his face and stood there awhile , waving away the mosquitoes with the cloth and itching his crotch absent-mindedly . Nearby , a seagull seemed to be carrying on an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictory lower-pitched cries that sounded like , Huh ! Huh ! Huh ! And something moving from one tree to another caught Seaman Houston 's eye . He kept his vision on the spot where he 'd seen it among the branches of a rubber tree , putting his hand out for the rifle without altering the direction of his gaze . It moved again . Now he saw that it was some sort of monkey , not much bigger than a Chihuahua dog . Not precisely a wild boar , but it presented itself as something to be looked at , clinging by its left hand and both feet to the tree 's trunk and digging at the thin rind with an air of tiny , exasperated haste . Seaman Houston took the monkey 's meager back under the rifle 's sight . He raised the barrel a few degrees and took the monkey 's head into the sight . Without really thinking about anything at all , he squeezed the trigger . The monkey flattened itself out against the tree , spreading its arms and legs enthusiastically , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scratch its back , it tumbled down to the ground . Seaman Houston was terrified to witness its convulsions there . It hoisted itself , pushing off the ground with one arm , and sat back against the tree trunk with its legs spread out before it , like somebody resting from a difficult job of labor . Seaman Houston took himself a few steps nearer , and , from the distance of only a few yards , he saw that the monkey 's fur was very shiny and held a henna tint in the shadows and a blond tint in the light , as the leaves moved above it . It looked from side to side , its breath coming in great rapid gulps , its belly expanding tremendously with every breath like a balloon . The shot had been low , exiting from the abdomen . Seaman Houston felt his own stomach tear itself in two . " Jesus Christ ! " he shouted at the monkey , as if it might do something about its embarrassing and hateful condition . He thought his head would explode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and the gulls kept screaming and the monkey kept regarding its surroundings carefully , moving its head and black eyes from side to side like someone following the progress of some kind of conversation , some kind of debate , some kind of struggle that the jungle-the morning-the moment-was having with itself . Seaman Houston walked over to the monkey and laid the rifle down beside it and lifted the animal up in his two hands , holding its buttocks in one and cradling its head with the other . With fascination , then with revulsion , he realized that the monkey was crying . Its breath came out in sobs , and tears welled out of its eyes when it blinked . It looked here and there , appearing no more interested in him than in anything else it might be seeing . " Hey , " Houston said , but the monkey did n't seem to hear . As he held the animal in his hands , its heart stopped beating . He gave it a shake , but he knew it was useless . He felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one around to know about it , he let himself cry like a child . He was eighteen years old . When he got back to the club down near the water , Houston saw that a school of violet-tinted jellyfish had washed up on the gray beach , hundreds of them , each about the size of a person 's hand , translucent and shriveling under the sun . The island 's small harbor lay empty . No boats ever came here other than the ferry from the naval base across Subic Bay . Only a few yards off , a couple of bamboo cabins fronted the strip of sand beneath palatial trees dribbling small purple blooms onto their roofs . From inside one of the cabins came the cries of a couple making love , a whore , Seaman Houston assumed , and some sailor . Houston squatted in the shade and listened until he heard them giggling no more , breathing no more , and a lizard in the cabin 's eaves began to call-a brief annunciatory warble and then a series of harsh , staccato chuckles-gek-ko ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , a crew-cut man in his forties with a white towel hitched under his belly and a cigarette clamped between his front teeth , and stood there splayfooted , holding the towel together at his hip with one hand , staring at some close but invisible thing , and swaying . An officer , probably . He took his cigarette between his thumb and finger and drew on it and let out a fog around his face . " Another mission accomplished . " The neighboring cabin 's front door opened and a Filipina , naked , hand over her groin , said , " He do n't like to do it . " The officer shouted , " Hey , Lucky . " A small Asian man came to the door , fully dressed in military fatigues . " You did n't give her a jolly old time ? " The man said , " It could be bad luck . " " Karma , " the officer said . " It could be , " the little fellow said . To Houston the officer said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be off . Now he realized that he 'd forgotten to leave and that the man was talking to him . With his free hand the man tossed his smoke and snaked aside the drape of the towel . To Houston he said-as he loosed almost straight downward a stream that foamed on the earth , destroying his cigarette butt- " You see something worth looking at , you let me know . " Feeling a fool , Houston went into the club . Inside , two young Filipinas in bright flowered dresses were playing pinball and talking so fast , while the large fans whirled above them , that Seaman Houston felt his equilibrium give . Sam , one of the marines , stood behind the bar . " Shut up , shut up , " he said . He lifted his hand , in which he happened to be holding a spatula . " What 'd I say ? " Houston asked . " Excuse . " Sam tilted his head toward the radio , concentrating on its sound like a blind man . " They caught the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that . " " There 's more about him . " " Okay , " Houston said . He drank some ice water and listened to the radio , but he suffered such a headache right now he could n't make out any of the words . After a while the officer came in wearing a gigantic Hawaiian-print shirt , accompanied by the young Asian . " Colonel , they caught him , " Sam told the officer . " His name is Oswald . " The colonel said , " What kind of name is that ? " - apparently as outraged by the killer 's name as by his atrocity . " Fucking sonofabitch , " Sam said . " The sonofabitch , " said the colonel . " I hope they shoot his balls off . I hope they shoot him up the ass . " Wiping at his tears without embarrassment he said , " Is Oswald his first name or his last name ? " Houston told himself that first he 'd seen this officer pissing on the ground , and now he was watching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir , we 're hospitable as hell . But generally Philippine military are n't served here . " " Lucky 's from Vietnam , " the colonel said . " Vietnam . You lost ? " " No , not lost , " the man said . " This guy , " the colonel said , " is already a jet pilot . He 's a South Viet Nam Air Force captain . " Sam asked the young captain , " Well , is it a war over there , or what ? War ? -budda-budda-budda . " He made his two hands into a submachine gun , jerking them in unison . " Yes ? No ? " The captain turned from the American , formed the phrases in his mind , practiced them , turned back , and said , " I do n't know it 's war . A lot people are dead . " " That 'll do , " the colonel agreed . " That counts . " " What you doing here ? " " I 'm here for helicopters training , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for a tricycle , " Sam said . " How old are you ? " " Twenty-two years . " " I 'm getting this little Slope his beer . You like San Miguel ? You mind that I called you a Slope ? It 's a bad habit . " " Call him Lucky , " the colonel said . " The man 's buying , Lucky . What 's your poison ? " The boy frowned and deliberated inside himself mysteriously and said , " I like Lucky Lager . " " And what kind of cigarettes you smoke ? " the colonel asked . " I like the Lucky Strike , " he said , and everybody laughed . Suddenly Sam looked at young Seaman Houston as if just recognizing him and said , " Where 's my rifle ? " For a heartbeat Houston had no idea what he might be talking about . Then he said , " Shit . " " Where is it ? " Sam did n't seem terribly interested-just curious . " Shit , " Seaman Houston said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the jungle . It was just as hot , and just as damp . All the same animals were making the same noises , and the situation was just as terrible , he was far from the places of his memory , and the navy still had him for two more years , and the President , the President of his country , was still dead-but the monkey was gone . Sam 's rifle lay in the brush just as he 'd left it , and the monkey was nowhere . Something had carried it off . He had expected to be made to see it again ; so he was relieved to be walking back to the club without having to look at what he 'd done . Yet he understood , without much alarm or unease , that he would n't be spared this sight forever . (
