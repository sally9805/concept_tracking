ONE <br> baltimore , maryland <br> JULY 20 , 1973 <br> the albums flipped forward into my hand . <br> Paranoid <br> Volume 4 <br> Master of Reality <br> And of course Black Sabbath , the album that started it all for the greatest band in the world : Black Sabbath . <br> I pulled a copy of each one , stuffed them under my arm and looked around the Record Barn . I 'd been coming here since I was a kid . In high school I use to sneak into the kitchen in the middle of the night to make a lunch just so I could pocket my lunch money . By the end of the week I had enough for a few singles . <br> Not much had changed at the Barn in the months since I had split town . Faded posters covered the grimy front windows , keeping the store dim even in the middle of the afternoon . The stench of pot still hid behind a thin wall of incense , and boxes of T-shirts and albums littered the narrow aisles like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosby look-alike , wandered around squeezing more albums into cluttered bins . He stopped in the aisle and stared at me . <br> " Are n't you supposed to be in school ? " he growled . <br> " I graduated two years ago , Bob , " I told him without looking up from the row of records I flipped through . <br> " Oh , " he grunted . " Well , do you need anything ? " <br> He did n't really sound interested in helping me . <br> " Nah . Just waiting for Frenchy . . . uh . . . Pete . " <br> A few minutes later Frenchy stumbled from the back room . His arms waved wildly around his head and shaggy brown hair swirled around his face . He flung a pile of records on the counter and wiped his face with the front of his Flamin ' Groovies T-shirt . <br> " What the hell 's wrong with you , Frenchy ? " <br> " I got caught in a spiderweb in the basement , " he said . He patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't call me that . " <br> We 'd been calling him Frenchy since a night he passed out drunk in the backseat of my car talking gibberish that we decided sounded like French . After I left town he convinced everyone to call him Pete again . It was going to take some getting used to . <br> " So did Alex actually get out today ? " I asked . <br> " Yeah . His mom 's having a party for him tonight . " <br> Frenchy sighed heavily . <br> " You sure he wants to see you ? " <br> " Probably not , " I answered . <br> Bob disappeared into the back room . I followed Frenchy while he walked through the store . Now and then he stopped to file a record into a bin . <br> " Man , I should n't have told you he was getting out , " Frenchy moaned . He moaned a lot . <br> " I just need to talk to him . " <br> " He did n't answer any of your letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know Alex better than he knows himself . " <br> " You drove all the way down from New York City just to talk to him ? " <br> " Something like that . " <br> Bob returned from the back room with a set of BMW keys in his hand and a briefcase with a Grateful Dead sticker on the side . Something about an old hippie with a BMW and a briefcase made me smile . <br> " Be sure to lock up , Pete . " <br> " Okay , Bob . See you tomorrow , " Frenchy said as the front door rattled closed . <br> Music played in the store . Something loud and noisy . I liked it . <br> " Who 's this ? " I asked . <br> " The Stooges . They 're from Detroit . " <br> " I dig it . " <br> " Really ? You actually like something other than Black Sabbath ? " <br> " Just need something to fill the time until their next album . " <br> " Whatever . " Frenchy laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . <br> " Which one ? " <br> When he was n't working at the Record Barn , Frenchy combined his musical talents and marginal high school acting experience into a couple of cover bands that played bars and private events . Want the Rolling Stones to rock your wedding reception ? Frenchy can do a hell of a Mick Jagger . Need Neil Diamond at your office holiday party ? Frenchy 's version of " Sweet Caroline " could get the accounting department on their feet . He could imitate anyone . <br> Frenchy finished restocking the bins then locked the front door . The cash register chimed as he stabbed at buttons until the drawer shot open . Frenchy grabbed the tray of cash and headed toward the back office . I followed him until he stopped , blocking the doorway . <br> " Where do you think you 're going ? " <br> " I do n't know . " I shrugged . " Just following you . " <br> " No way . Wait out here . " <br> " What 's the big deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hang out for that . " <br> " Not a chance , dude . That 's my rule . You , Alex and Keith are n't coming near the cash or the safe or the back room . I do n't even want you guys near the fucking mop closet . Just wait out there . " <br> I sat on the counter , started to read an issue of Rolling Stone , got bored and read Creem instead . A flier on bright yellow paper hung on the side of the counter . <br> THE MISTY MOUNTAIN HOPPERS <br> LED ZEPPELIN FAN CLUB <br> MEETINGS EVERY FRIDAY  --  CALL FOR INFO <br> I tore it down , folded it up then slipped it into my pocket . A switch flipped from the back room and the lights shut off . Frenchy reappeared and stood in the middle of the store going over everything in his head to make sure he had n't forgotten anything . He double-checked the back door then the tiny safe in the office . Then he checked the back door again . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchy said , turning off the rest of the lights in the store . <br> " Is he still working at Mancini 's ? " " Yeah . Installing car stereos . " <br> " And then uninstalling them in the middle of the night ? " <br> " Of course . " <br> Frenchy fished for his keys then stopped at the front door and turned around . <br> " Do n't you already own those ? " he asked , pointing to the stack of Sabbath albums under my arm . <br> " Wore them out . I need new copies . " <br> " You gon na pay for ' em ? " <br> " What do you think ? " <br> Frenchy sighed and opened the door . We walked together across the empty parking lot as the sun set behind the Record Barn and Baltimore looked every bit as small as it did when I 'd left . <br> Continues ...
