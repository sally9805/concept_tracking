" You 're a saint . " Frances Pratt hung up the telephone still hearing Sam Guff 's amused chuckle . She absentmindedly twirled one of her brown curls around her index finger . Sun poured through her office windows onto the plush navy carpet and upholstered armchairs . She debated drawing the blinds but decided instead to enjoy the warmth . Summer was here . Finally . Frances glanced at the cream invitation embossed with black script , the two envelopes , three pieces of tissue paper , and reply card that lay scattered in front of her on the large walnut desk . Mr. and Mrs. William Waller Lawrence The Church of the Holy Spirit , Manchester-by-the-Sea She turned over the larger of the two envelopes and examined the calligraphy : Miss Frances Taylor Pratt and Guest , 1382 Plainview Road , Orient , New York . Even her address seemed formal . Leaning back in her leather chair , she ran her finger over the raised lettering . Manchester . She could envision her aunt and uncle 's sprawling white clapboard house on Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor . The salty air peeled the paint on the dozens of black shutters , and moss grew in the acidic soil between the flagstones of the patio . Although her brief visits to the New England seaside town had become less frequent in recent years , in an odd way it felt like home-a place infused with welcome . The mere sight of the oversize brass door knocker in the shape of a lion 's head gave her a sense of belonging . It was a feeling she missed . Aunt Adelaide , her father 's only sister , had moved to Manchester with her infant daughter , Penelope , when she married for the second time . They 'd moved into Bill Lawrence 's family home and stayed there ever since . " I 've set down my roots , " she used to say with a polite smile whenever anyone asked how she could have left her birthplace . " And trees do n't do well in Manhattan . " Twenty-nine years later , the rambling house , its rooms full of faded chintz mismatched furniture , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " announced as if the weekend promised hordes of distant relatives rather than the small brood of cousins that they were , had begun the year Frances turned nine . They 'd offered the best of activities : camping on the private beach , eating Cheerios out of a waxed-paper-lined box in the early morning while still in her sleeping bag ; scavenger hunts that sent her scrambling across the rocky shore in search of a piece of blue sea glass , a sea star , or a periwinkle shell ; fishing expeditions in the canoe , dropping paper clip lines baited with raw bacon overboard in hopes of snagging a flounder ; late-night games of charades in the paneled library of the Lawrence home with its sweet smell of bitter orange potpourri . Frances could still recall the taste of her aunt 's angel food cake , the sound of the porch door as it slammed shut , the creak of the floorboards in the upstairs hall that always seemed louder at night when she snuck in past her curfew . These were her happiest childhood memories . Theodora Pratt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had become a permanent fixture in Manchester as well . She 'd moved from Ann Arbor , Michigan , after her husband died to the guest cottage at the edge of the property . Frances remembered well the two frenzied days she 'd spent listening to her grandmother bark directions as she 'd helped to unpack her eclectic possessions . Teddy 's collections of first editions and travel logs filled to overflowing the bookshelves in the sunken sitting room , and her Matelasse bedspreads brightened the two mildewed bedrooms . She remembered the sunny afternoon after they 'd hung the last beveled mirror . They 'd sat together in the screened-in porch , admiring the view of the harbor . " I get my independence without any of the troubles of home maintenance , " Teddy had remarked . " And it works for them . They get rent . Not much , but it 'll help with the taxes . " She 'd raised her eyebrows and said nothing further . As Frances now reflected , she realized it was the only reference to money she 'd ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to imagine that nearly five years had passed since that fall weekend . But hardly a Sunday came and went without Frances picking up the telephone to listen to her grandmother 's stories , the words rattling in her two-pack-a-day throat . At eighty-two , Teddy drove to lunch at the Singing Beach Club , played mah-jongg Tuesday afternoons , volunteered at the checkout desk of the local library , and walked her three dogs every day . The sight of her with her silver-handled walking stick and her pack of canines-an Irish terrier , a dachshund , and a one-eyed pit bull she 'd adopted from the North Shore Animal Rescue League after reading about its fighting injuries in a local paper-had to be a source of constant amusement to the residents on her route . And she still gossiped . It had n't taken her long to know everything about everyone in Manchester-by-the-Sea . She often spoke of raising her two children alone because their father had spent much of his career in the Far East and she had refused to go . " I know my conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't follow my husband to some tsetse fly-infested country with primitive sewers , but I was n't about to have my children educated abroad . Generations before me worked bloody hard to get to this country , and I intended to remain . Dick could do what he liked . He always did anyway , " she said , referring to her late husband . Frances remembered the note of pride in Teddy 's voice as she relayed her decision . An independent woman was a relatively rare commodity " in my day and age , " she liked to say . Frances thought now of the last time she 'd seen anyone from the paternal side of her family . She 'd been sitting by her father 's bed at New York University Medical Center when Adelaide entered the room unexpectedly , her hazel eyes and high cheekbones partially obscured by the oversize brim of a navy hat . Frances had been startled by her frailty , her tiny waist cinched by a leather belt and thin ankles covered in sheer black stockings . They 'd embraced quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses . Then she 'd removed her hat , approached her brother , and perched gently on the edge of his bed . Under the fluorescent hospital lights , the crow's-feet surrounding her eyes and the deep lines in her forehead reflected her fifty-three years . Adelaide had taken Richard Pratt 's limp hand in her bony fingers . " My dearest , dearest Richard , I 'm so sorry this happened to you , " she 'd cooed with a particular emphasis on " you . " Frances thought she saw her father 's fingers move in response , a feeble gesture meant to reflect the affection he felt for his younger sister , but she had n't been sure . " Tell me , " Adelaide had continued without looking at Frances . " Tell me everything I need to know about what happened . " Frances had n't known how to respond . An intercerebral hemorrhagic stroke on the left side of his brain , a ruptured blood vessel , extensive bleeding in the brain tissue ... The doctor 's words had echoed in her mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd stared blankly ahead , wishing her aunt would read her thoughts so that she could avoid articulating the diagnosis that condemned her father . " Never mind . What happened is n't important . What will happen now is all that matters . Please forgive me . We must look to the future , " Adelaide had reassured her as she 'd moved toward her and gently wiped tears from Frances 's face with a slightly perfumed linen handkerchief . Frances had n't even realized she 'd been crying , yet she could still remember the faint smell of tuberose , the feel of the cloth on her face . The gesture had seemed maternal , a tenderness that was foreign to Frances . She had n't wanted it to end . Now Hope Alexandra Lawrence , the only child of Bill and Adelaide 's marriage , was getting married . The telephone interrupted Frances 's reverie , and she reached to pick it up . " Fanny , it 's me , " Sam said . " Give me the date of that wedding again . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Typical Sam , Frances thought . Always efficient . The ferry from Orient Point to New London , Connecticut , the simplest way to get to New England from the easternmost tip of Long Island , was packed during the summer months , and a coveted spot on any weekend between Memorial and Labor Days had to be secured well in advance . " I 'll deal with it . It 's enough that you 've agreed to come . Standing around in jacket and tie making small talk on a summer Saturday is not your idea of a great time . " " I 'm honored that you want to take me , " Sam said with his usual humility . " Really I am . I 'm hardly the one you should have on your arm for such an occasion . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " " You should be escorted by some guy who wears Porter 's lotion and suspenders , has two middle names , and is a fourth-generation graduate of Groton . I 'm just a potato farmer . " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my stock market lingo and pretend I have a portfolio . " He lowered his voice and affected a lockjawed manner of speech . " Yukon Golds are my hot new commodity . " " Do n't be absurd , " Frances replied . " This is my cousin . " " That 's what I 'm afraid of . Your family . " Frances thought for a moment . She wished his words were true , that she had been part of the Lawrence household instead of just a visiting relative , so distant that she 'd needed a guest pass at the Manchester Field and Hunt Club in order to use the swimming pool . As an adolescent , she 'd spent many hours fantasizing that there had been a mistake , that she 'd actually been Adelaide 's daughter , or that her aunt would adopt her into the intact family . But fate had dealt her a different hand . " Actually , it 'll just be us . Dad ca n't go , " Frances remarked , thinking of her father 's ever worsening condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already fragile emotional state . " And Blair 's baby is due the twenty-fifth . I doubt she 'll be able to travel , " she said , referring to her younger sister . " What about your mother ? " " No , " Frances responded too quickly . Her parents had been divorced for more than thirty years , but that was n't the real reason her mother would stay away . She appreciated that Sam did n't inquire further . He knew her well enough to know that if she wanted to explain , she would without any prompting from him . They were silent . Even so , Frances felt comfortable . They often spent time together without speaking . They could read , sit in front of the fire with their own thoughts , or work in her garden without a word passing between them , but she never felt isolated or alone . Sam managed to put her at ease with his ability to share in her privacy . " How does vegetarian chili sound for dinner ? " " Is that my only choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky ? I 'll see if I can come up with something else . " " Thanks . See you tonight . " " I love you , " Sam added just before the line went dead . Frances smiled to herself as she caught his words . Her romance with her widower neighbor had evolved after seven years of friendship , weekly Wednesday night bingo games , and many hours of gardening . Two misfits , perhaps , but they had a mutual adoration and a shared affection for her two dogs and a reclusive life . The small-town quietness of Orient on the North Fork of Long Island suited them both . In the grocery store parking lot the previous fall , Sam had first told her he loved her . Why here ? Why now ? " I figured if I could make a shopping plaza feel special , if you could feel swept away even amid bags of toilet paper and laundry detergent and dog biscuits , you 'd trust me to fill the other parts of your life with romance . " Since that first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't disappoint . He never ended a conversation or turned off the light at night without washing her with those words . She had assumed that the magnetism of his smile , his voice , and his touch would pass or that she 'd discover a dark side , as she had with past relationships . But it had n't happened . There were days when Sam seemed so kind that she asked herself whether he was a figment of her imagination , an idealized man whose sensitivity and insight she 'd scripted in her mind . Was n't romance a predatory dance , a mixture of hunting and mating , hurting and courting , until one creature emerged the stronger and the other was destroyed ? It was n't supposed to make you feel confident , was it ? She wanted to relax , to feel safe in his embrace , to trust that nothing would change . But at moments her nerves flared . Was Sam really different ? Frances checked the " will attend " line on the reply card , sealed it in its prestamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation away in her desk drawer . Then she turned her attention to a legal pad covered in handwritten notes . The almost illegible scrawl formed the outline for her lecture to area law enforcement on how to respond to , and handle , domestic abuse cases . As president of the Long Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence , a job she had accepted shortly after leaving the Suffolk County District Attorney 's Office , she regularly gave public awareness and educational seminars , and she could recite her key points by rote : how to take a thorough history from the victim , document physical injuries , obtain temporary restraining orders , and work through the morass of social services to determine what state-funded food , shelter , and other aid could be available . Occasionally , especially when the administrative responsibilities of her new job seemed overwhelming or she was forced to attend another fund-raising luncheon , she missed the adrenaline and excitement of constant court appearances , presentations before the grand jury , all the stages of investigations and prosecutions of criminal cases . But most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and a good portion of her weekends as well , the coalition and its mission were causes she believed in . That made the bureaucratic headaches and long hours worthwhile . She made a note to herself in the margin : " Emphasize emotional abuse/psychological battery . " Police officers , prosecutors , and even judges needed a black eye before they were willing to intervene in personal matters , to punish a husband or a boyfriend for losing his temper , but there was more to domestic violence than bruises or blood . It was her job to explain that . Continues ...
