Chapter One Breathe in . Now out . I was twenty-eight years old with no criminal history and a Juris Doctor . I paid my bills on time , always remembered birthdays , and sometimes even washed my trash before recycling it . At best , I had the logistics of life down pat . At worst , one could argue I was marginally lame . In light of this , you can understand why I was a bit distraught that breathing had become a problem . Then there were the hot flashes . Could I be menopausal ? I hovered over my keyboard . Just one quick Google search on menopause . My hands began to twitch . Who could blame them ? I was committing a cardinal sin . Twitch twitch twitch . Breathe in . Now out . Jumping Jack Flash . Who was I kidding ? I definitely needed hormones , before the facial hair made a cameo . Nobody liked a lady with a ' stache . " Where 's the McMillan file ? You know she 's looking for it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged my shoulders , unwilling to commit two fouls at once-talking and using the Internet . Janet tensed up like a constipated poodle . In spite of her daily invective , I still felt a wee bit bad for Janet . The lady had been railroaded more times than Amtrak 's busy northeast corridor . Twentyyears in this institution had turned what I assumed was originally a good-natured suburbanite ( Janet then ) into angry roadkill ( Janet now ) . After all , it had only been a month for me and already the hair and hot flashes had commenced . Based on the precedent standing before my very eyes , I knew my future was bleak . Great ! My " early menopause " search had elicited 26,715 hits . I definitely had it . Breathe , hot flash , twitch . I could n't believe I had just been pitying angry Janet when I 'd morphed into a full-fledged freak show . I glanced back at Matthew to see if he was still breathing . I was beginning to worry that Matthew was going to simply die one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we would n't even know it until she yelled for him . If he was n't in the torture chamber in under two seconds , only then would we know of his untimely demise . Maybe I 'd Google " sitting up dead . " Surely , that was worse than the Pause . Just as my twitchy tendons were reaching for the keyboard again , Evan the judicial evangelist came sauntering by my desk , pausing so briefly I almost did n't have to look up at him . Almost . " Have you finished Robinson yet ? " This was stated more as an accusation than a question . Accusation verified by his ever so polite pivot and turn . With his impossibly straight back facing me , Evan whispered : " Well , I 'm handing in Welbert and with any luck will get something challenging . " I truly did n't know how Harvard Law School managed to do it , but somehow that place picked the world 's most vapid , chainsaw-to-spinal-cord annoying people to fill its esteemed corridors . Grades , LSAT scores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandmother into committing murder in a minute flat . Alas ! I heard a stir from behind . Could it be Matthew ? I turned and indeed he had managed to sit up and was stretching in my direction . I furrowed my brow . He rolled his eyes . Translation . Me : " What ? " Matthew : " Evan is a total moron . " Communication complete . Over the past few weeks , we had managed to master the universal language of judgment without actually speaking . DING ! " Thirteenth floor , going down ! " It was the judge 's elevator , our only warning of her impending arrival . " SHEEEEERAAAA ! ! ! SHAYYYLLLLA ! ! ! " Not this again . The decibels I 'd grown accustomed to . But my name was SHEILA . Not Sheera . Not Shayla . Not Sheba ( though I secretly liked it when she called me Sheba ) . " GET IN HERE NOW ! ARE YOU DEAF ? ! ! " I wish . I dashed into the torture chamber , skidding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly pissed . Vertical eyebrows . Penciled in . Squinty eyes . Lips curled . Dancing bouffant . She was about to pounce . So was her bright red lipstick , which was curiously everywhere but on her lips . " Yes , Judge . " " I read your memo in W.A. versus Trenton . Do they not teach you English in Pakistan ? " Not the Pakistan thing again . I was Indian . Not that I was one of those Indians who hated Pakistan . It 's just that I was n't Pakistani . Just like I was n't Croatian . " Your Hon-Your hon- " " I surmise not . All I can say is that it does n't take a Supreme Court justice to interpret basic state statutes-and you failed to do even that ! " " I , um , Your Hon- " " NO ! NO ! NO ! " The dreaded hat trick of noes . It was n't a good sign . " I AM A FEDERAL JUDGE ! " Indeed , among other things . " Can you even comprehend what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got even smaller . Bouffant started break-dancing . Little hand reached for big Supreme Court casebook . Slow mo . Hand lifted book . " I just , um , thought- " WHACK ! She 'd nailed me , yet again . This time smack in the face . " NOW , GET OUT ! GET OUT ! " She pounded her small fist on the desk . I stumbled back to my cubicle , a trickle of blood running down my cheek . Could you catch hemophilia ? Bleeding to death sounded sort of nice , cozy even . Parking it in my tattered swivel chair , I stared longingly across the Delaware River at Camden , New Jersey . Just six months ago , I had been a well-liked editor on the Columbia Law Review . I had a killer wardrobe , a darling ( rent-stabilized ) apartment in the West Village and a fabulous group of friends . Now , I was plotting an escape to New Jersey with dried blood on my face . I was a federal court of appeals law clerk . Pushing thirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly the best experience of my life . Just like everyone at Columbia Law had promised . The above serve as illustrative examples of the kind of environment that law schools create . A climate in which the law student-the most paranoid , risk-averse overachiever this universe has to offer-is brainwashed from the very first day of school to believe that if he or she does n't get a judicial clerkship , life will effectively end . Sure , we 'd all heard about the glitz and glamour of a law degree . Three short years , a mere hundred twenty thousand dollars , and voil ! " You can do anything ! " ACLU . State Department . District attorney . President of the United States . There was just one little glitch . You needed a judicial clerkship . A federal one if at all possible . Sheila Raj : " How does one get a job at the U.S. attorney 's office ? " Torts professor : " Well , that 's impossible unless you clerk . " Sheila Raj : " I 'd love to teach here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " You 'll definitely need a court of appeals clerkship , if not one on the Supreme Court . " Courts of appeals are one rung below the Supreme Court . Typically , to even be considered for a Supreme Court clerkship , one has to have first completed a court of appeals clerkship , and as such , said appellate clerkship is the most prestigious gig one can obtain straight out of law school . Lesson : Sheila Raj , along with all of her nervous classmates , would n't be employable without a clerkship . This was a bit of a problem , considering that getting a perfect score on the LSAT seemed easier . Top-ten law school . Straight As . Two law professors attesting to your legal genius . In a place where As were less common than all-night raves , obtaining a clerkship seemed to be an insurmountable task . Luckily for me , taking law school exams turned out to be like learning how to ride a bicycle . After a few falls during my first semester torts final , I got back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As such , the entire Columbia Law School community insisted that I apply to every federal judge in the United States of America and its outlying territories . And why not ? According to every professor and former law clerk , working for a judge was " the best job you 'll ever have . " A sample page from Columbia Law 's clerkship center read : " Judge Sanders is brilliant and a wonderful mentor , " " Writing opinions with Judge Nederholm is the most exciting experience I 've ever had-professional or otherwise , " " You 'll learn more in a year from Judge Franklin than during the rest of your entire life . " Based on what everyone said and wrote , a clerkship was better than drugs , sex , and rock and roll combined . It was incredible that all the 1960s hippies did n't turn to the law rather than to acid and Janis Joplin . I had to have it . Not only for my own personal growth but also to land the job of my dreams . After interning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer after my One L year , I was sold . I was going to fight the good fight . Protect the disenfranchised from the almighty government . Make America what the founders had envisioned . It was clear that I needed a clerkship to land a job there without first having to slave away in the litigation department of a big New York City sweatshop . Yet even a fiery litigator from such a sweatshop would be hard pressed to crack the case of the clerkship . United States Federal Judges v. Sheila Raj , Third-Year Law Student Facts : For weeks , hundreds of thousands of law students packed into Columbia Law 's library , sitting for hours on end , cutting , pasting , printing , stuffing , and sealing hundreds of envelopes with a good old-fashioned ass kiss . New York , Miami , Chicago , Washington DC , Philadelphia , St. Louis , Cincinnati , Dallas . Even the lady at the post office thought Raj was a weirdo ( " Girlfriend , if you do n't get a job for all this " - pointing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth ) . Being pitied by a postal worker did n't exactly inspire confidence . Question presented : Does Raj get a clerkship and live happily ever after , or not and die ? Holding : Nearly two hundred applications in over a dozen cities yielded three whole interviews . The first one-a district court judge in Manhattan . Sure , Judge Cortland was n't on a court of appeals , but he was in New York . A huge plus . When asked the paradigmatic question , " Do you have anything to add ? " Raj responded , " Yes , I 'm a hypochondriac . " Not the right answer . The second go-round involved Chicago and too much nervous talk about the wind . No dice . Three 's the charm ! Sheila Raj landed an offer from the Honorable Helga Friedman , court of appeals judge in Philadelphia , President Gerald Ford appointee , first woman ever to sit on a federal court of appeals and former Penn Law professor . In sum , a Legal Goddess . I accepted on the spot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but spending one short year in Philadelphia was going to make my career . Heck , it 'd probably make my life . The city of brotherly love beckoned ! " Sheels , it 's adorable ! It 's huge ! Check out the gorgeous floors and ohmyGod-you get tons of natural light ! " my sister , Puja , squealed as we entered my new apartment on Twelfth Street between Spruce and Pine , smack in the middle of the " gayborhood . " Like South Beach and Chelsea , the gay mafia had transformed this neighborhood from filthy to fabulous in a matter of two bookstore straight ahead , French bistro to the right . As for my apartment , it felt like a palace compared to my place in New York . " Eight hundred fifty square feet of pure prewar charm ! " That 's what the ad said in the Philadelphia Inquirer and it was true . The most charming part ? Eight hundred fifty bucks a month ! For that , you 'd be lucky to get bedbugs and a bathroom share in Brooklyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you described . For once I do n't think you exaggerated , " Sanjay said , playfully squeezing my shoulder . Sanjay and I had been dating for about two years . He was a radiology resident in Reston , Virginia , my hometown . I 'd known him since I was about three minutes old , as our parents had been best friends since their medical school days in India . Any semblance of incest had been avoided thanks to the fact that Sanjay was four years older than me and had failed to acknowledge my existence until a few years earlier , when we 'd seen each other at Thanksgiving . A girl could n't have asked for a more dependable or decent man . And shy of landing the lead in a Bollywood film , our mothers could n't have been happier . " You know , you guys , I think I may never leave Philly , " I said , taking in my palace . " You can actually live like a normal person rather than a starving bag lady . " " Yeah , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Jesus , you were probably the only graduate student in the city who lived around the corner from Pastis , " Puja replied . Sanjay , seemingly bored , retreated to the bathroom . " Anyway , what I meant was that I think I have the potential to be a huge hit in this town . You know-the big fish , small pond scenario . It does n't hurt that I clearly live in the most fashionable neighborhood and- " BANG ! BANG ! BANG ! " Hey , hello ? " a man whispered ( loudly ) at my prewar door . " My fans have already come to see me ! " I sauntered over , smiling . It 's not that I was expecting Elton John with a fruit basket , but Mister Rogers ? Before me was a gray-haired man with thin eyebrows and a sprayed-on tan . " Uh , um , hey , where is he ? " Mister Rogers peered inside , eyes darting from side to side . Puja waved , warily . " That 's not a man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she talked about incessantly ) , was five foot four , 110 pounds . She was wearing a short skirt and pink flip-flops . It did n't take a detective to figure out that my sister was , in fact , not a man . " Who are you looking for ? " I closed the door a bit so he 'd stop eyeballing my 850-square-foot gem . He was starting to freak me out . " Hey , hey up here ! Up here ! " a timid male voice beckoned from above . I looked up , along the winding staircase of my new building . Standing two floors up was a twenty-something guy in designer jeans and a tight-fitted black T-shirt with the word " bitch " on it . If he had n't been emaciated and wearing a three-seasons-ago shirt , he 'd be really cute-just the kind of fag I 'd have been more than happy to hag . Mister Rogers muttered a " Sorry " before bounding up the stairs . " Hey " - cough-  " hey you " - cough , cough- " welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Thanks . " And with that , we both closed our doors . Things were slightly off in Mister Rogers 's neighborhood . Chapter Two My first day of work ! I put on my Monday best ( beige Theory suit ) and hummed through the beautiful cobblestone streets of Center City , Philadelphia . After skillfully maneuvering myself through what felt more like a village-how quaint ! - than a city , I arrived at the courthouse , a large , nondescript brown building at the corner of Market and 6th Streets , a mere twenty-five-minute walk from home . Even better , it was right across from Independence Hall ! This was the birthplace of America and I was in the thick of it . I could n't believe my good fortune . Inside , I followed the cardboard signs that read , " New Clerks " in uneven black marker . I was careful to smile at all the security guards . There were dozens of them . But of course . This was a really important place where really important business went down . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through three or four different corridors-all brown and poorly lit-to a windowless room where other nervous Nellies loitered about in suits . Before I could open my mouth to introduce myself to a smallish , balding guy with a big mole on his nose , Martha Stewart 's doppelgnger flew through the door , came to a screeching halt , and started grinning like a horny frat guy . " Welcome , clerks ! We are just soooooo happy you 're here . Just a few things before you can get crackin ' ! " For some reason , I 've always felt embarrassed when people drop the gs off the end of conjugated verbs . So , I quickly turned my head to avoid eye contact with Ms. Martha . What I found was more troubling-many clerks had already broken off into little cliques . Why had nobody invited me ? I was wearing a cute outfit and had great hair . What was the matter ? Thankfully , we got ushered out before I could totally freak about the lost popularity contest . Unceremoniously shoved out the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had just turned to talk to a tall skinny girl . " Where did you go to law school ? " he asked her without saying hello . " Northeastern .
