The Wanderer ( rack ) Chapter One The Sea The sea , the sea , the sea . It rolled and rolled and called to me . Come in , it said , come in . And in I went , floating , rolling , splashing , swimming , and the sea called , Come out , come out , and further I went but always it swept me back to shore . And still the sea called , Come out , come out , and in boats I went'in rowboats and dinghies and motorboats , and after I learned to sail , I flew over the water , with only the sounds of the wind and the water and the birds , all of them calling , Sail on , sail on . And what I wanted to do was go on and on , across the sea , alone with the water and the wind and the birds , but some said I was too young and the sea was a dangerous temptress , and at night I dreamed a terrible dream . A wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hovered over me and then down , down it came , but always I awoke before the water covered me , and always I felt as if I were floating when I woke up . Chapter Two Three Sides I am not always such a dreamy girl , listening to the sea calling me . My father calls me Three-sided Sophie : one side is dreamy and romantic ; one is logical and down-to-earth ; and the third side is hardheaded and impulsive . He says I am either in dreamland or earthland or mule-land , and if I ever get the three together , I 'll be all set , though I wonder where I will be then . If I 'm not in dreamland or earthland or mule-land , where will I be ? My father says my logical side is most like him , and the dreamy side most like my mother , which is n't entirely fair , I do n't think . My father likes to think of himself as a logical man , but he is the one who pores over pictures of exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safari ! " and " We should zip through the air in a hot-air balloon ! " And although my mother is a weaver and spins silky cloths and wears flowing dresses , she is the one who gives me sailing textbooks and makes me study water safety and weather prediction and says things like " Yes , Sophie , I taught you to sail , but that does n't mean I like the idea of you being out there alone on the water . I want you to stay home . Here . With me . Safe . " My father says he does n't know who my hardheaded mule side resembles . He says mules do n't run in the family . I am thirteen , and I am going to sail across the ocean . Although I would like to go alone  --  alone ! alone ! flying over the water !  --  I 'm not . My mule-self begged a place aboard a forty-five-foot sailboat with a motley crew : three uncles and two cousins . The uncles  --  Stew , Mo , and Dock  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If the slightest harm comes to my Sophie , I 'll string you all up by your toes . " She is n't worried ( although maybe she should be ) about the influence of my cousin Brian  --  quiet , studious , serious Brian  --  but she frets over the bad habits I might learn from my other cousin , Cody . Cody is loud , impulsive , and charming in a way my mother does not trust . " He 's too charming , " she says , " in a dangerous sort of way . " My mother is n't the only person who is not thrilled for me to take this trip . My uncles Stew and Mo tried their best to talk me out of it . " It 's going to be a bunch of us guys , doing guy things , and it would n't be a very pleasant place for a girl , " and " Would n't you rather stay home , Sophie , where you could have a shower every day ? " and " It 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was determined to go , and my mule-self kicked in , spouting a slew of sailing and weather terms , battering them over the head with all the things I 'd learned in my sailing books , and with some things I 'd made up , for good measure . Uncle Dock  --  the good uncle , I call him , because he 's the one who does n't see any harm in my coming  --  said , " Heck , she knows more about boats than Brian and Cody put together , " and so they caved in . There are two other reasons my mother has not tied me to my bed and refused to let me go . The first is that Uncle Dock gave her an extensive list of the safety provisions aboard the boat , which include a satellite navigator , the Global Positioning System . The second reason , not a very logical one , but one that somehow comforts my mother , is that Bompie is on the other side of the ocean . We will end up in Bompie 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment . Bompie is my grandfather  --  my mother 's father , and also Uncle Dock , Stew , and Mo 's father  --  and he lived with my parents for many years . He is like a third parent and I love him because he is so like me . He is a man of three sides , like me , and he knows what I am thinking without my having to say it . He is a sweet man with a honey tongue and he is a teller of tales . At the age of seventy-two , Bompie decided to go home . I thought he was already in his home , but what he meant by home was the place where he was born , and that place was " the rolling green hills of England . " My father was wrong about mules not running in the family . When Bompie decided to return to England , nothing was going to stop him . He made up his mind and that was that , and off he went . Bye-bye , Bompie.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
