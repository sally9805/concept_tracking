Perhaps none of this would have happened had they not been arguing about golf balls . <br> They called each other , as men will , by their surnames  --  Parrish , Mason , and Duncan . Mason 's last name , technically , was McDougherty , but he 'd moved from Mason , Texas , when he was in eighth grade , so they 'd called him " McDougherty from Mason " until everyone grew tired of that , and the city , not the surname , stuck . It was better than Doughy , after all . <br> The three worked at the coffee shop , Parrish 's coffee shop  --  Fritter John 's . Parrish 's first name was John , they sold fritters , good ones , and everyone agreed that Fritter John 's sounded to some degree <br> like Friar John 's , and he was a character in Robin Hood ( or so they thought ) , and Robin Hood was a book they all could get behind . <br> At the strip mall across the street from the coffee shop there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few tables and a deli , and there was also a Chinese restaurant  --  Mr. Wu 's Imperial Buffet . It was to that buffet one Monday afternoon the three men were headed for a late lunch . They 'd eaten stromboli four days running , and Mondays were Moo Goo Gai Pan Mondays . Mr. Wu made a mean moo goo . <br> On their way out the door , after they flipped the Out to Lunch sign and locked up , Parrish gave the sidewalk in front of his store a quick sweep , then leaned the broom against the table nearest the door so he 'd remember to take it back inside after lunch . Picking up the broom , Mason used it as a baseball bat , swatting at a crumpled paper cup Duncan had dug out of the trash  --  a cup Parrish had just swept up . His pitch missed twice and , ragingly hungry , Duncan forfeited the game in favor of getting to the food . Mason , switching the broom into an imaginary golf club , gave the wadded cup a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parrish fetch it and return it to the trash . <br> That 's how the argument began . Nothing serious ; their arguments rarely were , though each fought for his own  --  or any assumed  --  position with a solemn ferocity . The three had known each other forever , and arguing came as naturally as drinking espresso , both activities performed with convivial and cavalier abandon . <br> Nonetheless , Mason 's poor ( in Parrish 's sage opinion ) golf swing spurred a debate on form and finger placement . This took them across the parking lot . By the time they 'd reached the opposite curb , they 'd begun postulating the effects of a proper golf swing on , say , a racquetball . Naturally , squash balls came up . By the time they 'd reached Mr. Wu 's , the topic changed to the differences between squash and racquetball . And by the time they were filling plates at the buffet , having realized none of them knew the first thing about squash , they reinvigorated the " A Golf Club 's Effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis balls . Here , all agreed , tennis balls would be no good . Finally , seated and eating , their conversation moved to a higher plane  --  they began arguing about the nature of golf balls themselves . More accurately , they argued about the little dents on the surface of golf balls . <br> " Purely cosmetic . " <br> This was Duncan 's position , the one he argued between forkfuls of rice and beefy soy bits , which he scooped into his mouth at an alarming pace . He was nearly finished with his second trip to the buffet while Mason and Parrish were still polishing off round one . In his defense , it was well past three o'clock . They often ate lunch this late in order to serve coffee to customers on their lunch breaks , but Duncan though twenty-six years old , was still one of those tall , lean , unfillable sorts of men whose metabolism ticked and gnawed on par with a growing teenage horse . <br> " You eating that egg roll ? " Duncan reached for Mason 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand by Mason 's fork . <br> " Give me a chance , Dunc . " <br> " Well , hurry up . " <br> " It 's an **25;321;TOOLONG buffet , " Mason reminded him . " You can go get six more egg rolls if you want . " <br> Duncan gave a forlorn glance at the buffet , as if it were a ship far , far out at sea . Mason 's job , or so he took it upon himself , was to spend a large portion of the day reminding Duncan of the obvious . They were all roughly of an age , had gone to high school and college together , but Mason was the shortest of the three . Always had been . Not too short , not bad short , not dwarfishly short , just short er than his two friends . Perhaps this explained his constant need to be on offense , to have a fork at the ready to swat with , to continually pummel the most oblivious of the three with the obvious . Perhaps he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <br> " Cosmetic ? " Mason announced his displeasure loudly and in an upward direction , as if he were trapped down a well and calling for help . By this late in the afternoon , Mr. Wu 's lunch crowd  --  though <br> considerable , being a well-known and well-liked buffet  --  had mostly dissipated , so Mason could be loud . <br> He could argue expansively with only a minimal return of odd stares . " Please ! " <br> Parrish joined in . " Would you like to disagree or shall I ? " <br> " Come on , it 's obvious ! " Mason pleaded . <br> The other two waited . They knew he wanted them to wait , that Mason liked a pause and wanted someone to beg him for his answer . Parrish and Duncan would n't indulge him so far as that  --  they <br> would n't ask or guess  --  but they could appreciate the drama of a good pause . Besides , they were eating , and the food was tasty , and Mr. Wu had already begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several big silver trays back to the kitchen , leaving empty , steaming holes amongst the food choices  --  holes that would no longer be refilled , not this late . They 'd seen the last of the kung pao and chicken chow mein for today 's visit , they knew , and that both saddened and invigorated their eating . <br> With great exaggeration , Mason cleared his throat . " Aerodynamics . " <br> " No way . " Duncan objected so immediately , a flurry of white rice fell from his mouth back into the plate over which he hovered . <br> <br> " Yes , aerodynamics . The dents decrease wind resistance , like the fins on the back of a Camaro . " <br> " They 're not fins . " Parrish gulped his Coke . " It 's called a spoiler . " <br> " I call them fins . " <br> " You call them wrong . " <br> " I like fins better . " <br> " Forget it . " Parrish waved a hand . " Instead , tell me how dents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin , cutting the air more effectively , thereby de creasing resistance . " Mason said it quickly , all in one breath . Sometimes enough words said extremely quickly was an easy win , or at <br> least a serious advance . <br> " No , they do n't , " Parrish objected . <br> " Those fins do n't , " Duncan added through a mouth muffled with food . <br> " The fins do , " Parrish clarified . " The dents do n't . " <br> Duncan shook his head and chomped the end off Parrish 's egg roll . " Those fins do n't . I know they do n't . " <br> " Yes , they do . " Parrish elbowed Mason . " Tell him . " <br> " He 's right . " Mason waved his fork . " The fins decrease all kinds of wind resistance . You put a Camaro with fins next to a Camaro with no fins , and you 'll see which one 's faster . " <br> Duncan finished Parrish 's egg roll . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Duncan swallowed . " Back in high school . Remember Walter Spivins , who had that maroon Camaro ? Well , he was trying to decide if he wanted to go back and get the fins , so we raced his maroon one against Bill Finley 's , out behind the gym after the state game . " <br> <br> " Bill Finley moved to Ohio the year before we went to state . " Parrish looked around his plate , then under it , looking for his egg roll . <br> Duncan disagreed . " No , you 're thinking of Bill  --  what 's his name  --  the guy with the hats . " <br> " That was Finley , " said Parrish , taking Mason 's egg roll , which he assumed was his , somehow either stolen or misplaced . " Finley always had two baseball caps hanging from the mirror of his Camaro , and Spivins 's was fire-engine red , not maroon . " <br> Duncan waved a hand , dismissing the details . " Whichever . The car with the fins lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like those dents on golf balls . " <br> " What kind of cosmetic effect do dents have ? " Parrish challenged . <br> Duncan did n't answer . He just stared at the other two . Then , in a very addled way , said , " What ? " <br> To this , neither Parrish nor Mason responded . They waited . Duncan could be addled , they knew . But Duncan also knew they knew , and he 'd often hide behind an addled what , hoping the others would forget what they 'd asked and move on . Sometimes he 'd what just to give himself time to make up an answer he would then posit as absolute truth . This what was pure stall . <br> Finally , Mason restated , " How are dents cosmetic ? " <br> Duncan stopped chewing  --  for him , a bold and singular move . " What ? " <br> Parrish pursued . " Are those little dents aesthetically pleasing to you ? " <br> " No . " Duncan sounded wounded , hurt . " Butyou know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nine wood , you scuff it all up ? " <br> <br> " So ? " <br> " So , you scuff and dent it up ! If the golf ball were perfectly smooth and white , you 'd see ! Every little scratch ! " <br> " So ? " <br> " So they pre-dent golf balls so you do n't feel bad after you ding them up . Purely cosmetic . Same reason you spackle a wall so it wo n't show scuffs . " <br> Parrish put up a hand to stay Mason 's attack and took this one himself . " So , according to this line of thinking , we should have scuffed and dented Finley 's Camaro just in case he had a wreck or , say , drove down a particularly gravelly road ? " <br> " Actually , " said Mason , " Dunc did dent up Finley 's Camaro pretty bad . " <br> " I did not . " <br> " You tried to haul that volleyball pole and two ice chests on top of it , remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first at Mason , then Parrish , trying hard to bluff . Then he surrendered . " Okay , but if that pole had n't caught that tree " <br> " Nearly tore the fin off . " Mason wiped his mouth with his napkin and pushed his plate to one side . <br> " I thought we were talking about golf ball dents ? " asked Duncan . <br> " Gentlemen " Parrish tapped the side of his glass with a spoon . <br> " You 're both wrong . " He reached a hand across the table , twirled the round condiment rack that stood in its center , and carefully picked out his visual aid . " Look at this saltshaker . " He held it aloft . For a moment , three grown men stared at a saltshaker . <br> " What about it ? " <br> <br> Parrish rotated it with the tips of his fingers , catching the light as if it were a gem . " Look at the sides . Five , six-sided . It 's not smooth ; it 's got sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eight , " Duncan corrected . <br> " What is ? " <br> " Octagon is eight . Octa  --  octa  --  octa . Like October , like octopus . " <br> " Why are we talking about octopuses ? " asked Mason . <br> " Octopi , " said Duncan . <br> " Whatever ! " Parrish shook the shaker dangerously in front of their eyes . " This shaker , we agree , it 's got sides , right ? " <br> They thought about it , but no one could find a way to argue that it did n't . <br> Duncan took the bait . " So ? " <br> " Well " Parrish let the shaker slip into his fist , grasped it as if he 'd just solved the mystery . " Why ? " <br> Like the characters at the end of an Agatha Christie novel , Duncan and Mason blinked stupidly at the events unfolding around them . <br> Sheepishly , Duncan tried , " Uhaerodynamics ? " <br> " No ! " Parrish plonked the shaker down decisively on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meant . No one knew if that was a word . Mason picked up the saltshaker , stared at it . " Are you saying that the dents on golf balls are purposefully provided for added grippability ? " <br> " Exactly . " <br> Continues ...
