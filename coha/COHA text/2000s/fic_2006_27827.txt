Cassidy stood in the bathroom , looking in the mirror , trying to get her hair clip to stay in place . She could 've kicked herself for not letting her sister , Sheeka , braid it the day before . After getting frustrated , Cassidy threw the clip into the bathroom sink and just tied her hair in a ponytail . She tucked the yellow spandex T-shirt into her sky blue jeans , and strained to examine her ass in the mirror to make sure the fabric was n't bunched up , giving her the " ass lumps . " Normally Cassidy would n't dream of leaving the house without being dressed to kill , but comfort was more important than fashion for the drive ahead of her . Cassidy was one of those girls who , no matter what they 're wearing are still banging . She was a tall girl who had long straight hair . She was a nice shade of brown with a china-doll face . She was kind of on the thin side , but Cassidy had enough body to turn heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help but notice her . Cassidy walked back into the room that she and Sheeka shared , and looked around in disgust . There were clothes strewn all over Sheeka 's bed and the computer chair . This was just one more reason that she had to get out of her mother 's house . Cassidy was more neat and organized , while Sheeka was a slob . It took Cassidy nearly ten more minutes to find the car keys . By then she was burnt , because she was already late and had a long drive ahead of her . After finding her keys she took one last look in the mirror and headed toward the front door . When she opened it , a drunken Sheeka was standing there , trying to open the neighbor 's door with her key . She stood wide-legged , trying to keep herbalance on the tiled floor . Her shapely thighs threatened to tear through the fabric of her much-too-tight outfit . Sheeka was Cassidy 's sister , but they had two different fathers . Sheeka was short and dark-skinned like their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty as Cassidy . For this she secretly resented her sister . She felt like people favored Cassidy because she was prettier . " Sheeka , " Cassidy said , scaring the hell out of the girl . " What the hell are you doing ? " " Hey , girl , " Sheeka said with a slur . " What you doing coming outta Mr. Brown 's house ? " Cassidy looked at her sister as if she had bumped her head . " Girl , you are as drunk as a skunk . " " Nah , I ai n't , sis . I 'm just a little tipsy . Will and them niggaz threw a party last night . It was off the hook ! " Sheeka said , getting loud . " Girl , you better keep your voice down , " Cassidy warned . " If Mommy catches your ass out here all fucked up , she 's likely to kill you . " " Please , " Sheeka said , staggering into the house . " That woman wo n't be up for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , Sheeka ? " " Bout . . . two or three , " Sheeka said , trying to focus on her fingers as she counted off . " Sheeka , it 's six-thirty in the damn morning . " " Oops . Guess I was a lil off , huh ? " Sheeka tried to walk to the bedroom but she had some trouble balancing on the stiletto heels that she was wearing . Sheeka fell flat on her face , causing her short black skirt to rise up . Cassidy looked at her little sister , disgusted as her entire ass became visible , due to a lack of panties . " Girl , you 're a mess , " Cassidy scolded . As she reached down to help her sister up , her nose was assaulted by the smell of liquor and sweat . It did n't take a rocket scientist to figure out what Sheeka was doing at Will 's party . She had tried to warn her sister time and again about the kinds of men who stalked those mean streets , but Sheeka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that Cassidy could do because Sheeka was almost eighteen . " I do n't believe this shit , " Cassidy said , helping Sheeka to her feet . " What the hell were you drinking ? " " Was n't nothing . " Sheeka swayed . " Had a lil Henney , popped a few bottles . Nothing heavy . It sure was a bomb-ass party , though . " " I 'll bet , " Cassidy said sarcastically . She helped her sister into the bedroom and laid her down on the bed . She watched the drunken mess as she drifted instantly to sleep . Her little sister was going down the same road that their mother had danced on . She and her sister would definitely need to talk , but it would have to wait until she came back . Felon found himself up with the chickens . He had gotten a good night 's sleep , so he was feeling quite refreshed . After he had bagged up the remaining ounce of coke , he lay out to watch a movie . The movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day . He needed to get up with his partner and handle some pressing business . Felon was a very handsome young man who danced on the borderline of being pretty . His body was athletic and muscular , but beneath baggy clothes he looked slim . He had skin the color of brown M &Ms; and eyes that seemed to twinkle in certain light . Felon was n't what you would call a lady 's man , but he never found himself shorthanded when certain itches needed to be scratched . After taking a quick shower , Felon hopped into his blue Sean Jean sweat suit and his blue New Balance shoes . After checking himself out in the mirror and making sure his smile was on a million , Felon headed for the front door . One his way there , his little brother Sammy passed him in the hallway . Sammy was very dear to Felon . He was still a baby when their father was murdered so he really had no memory of him , but Felon carried the pain with him every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that he had to step up and fill their father 's shoes as the man of the house . He had made a promise to himself to raise Sammy the right way and never subject him to having to go without . In a sense , Felon had traded his own life for his little brother 's . Inwardly he hated the fact that he slung poison , but he really did n't have a whole lot of choices . Or at least that 's what he constantly told himself . Felon had been a bright student in high school and even had the chance to go to college . He often pondered continuing his education , but the need for money overrode that . He could n't waste four more years in school while his family went without . He needed to make some quick cash , and the grind was the quickest way to get it . " Blow up or throw up " was how he looked at it . He did what was necessary to ensure the survival of his family . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chilling , yo , " Sammy said , rubbing the sleep from his eyes . With the same dark skin and sparkling eyes , he looked like a ten-year-old version of Felon . " You getting ready for school ? " " Uh huh . " " You got paper ? " Felon asked , fishing around in his pocket . " Nah uh . " " Here , " Felon said , fishing a ten-dollar bill from his pocket . " A man should never walk around without having some type of money in his pocket . That jewel is for free , kid . " Felon rubbed his little brother 's head and headed out the front door . When Felon got downstairs to the lobby , his two soldiers were waiting for him as instructed . The first soldier was a lanky kid who bopped a little too hard when he walked . He called himself Street Wise or Wise for short . The other soldier was a five-foot Spanish kid called Goosey . They were just two knucklehead cats from around the way that were looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two things would happen with the two . They would pan out and become good soldiers or they would be cannon fodder on a dummy mission . " What 's good , fam ? " Wise asked , leaning in to hug Felon . " Chilling , " Felon said , keeping him at arm 's length . He never got too personal with anyone who was n't within his inner circle . " Check it , there 're two packs in the building , right behind the door to the B stairwell . Y'all do the damn thang and by the time y'all finish them , somebody will be bringing you more . I 'm out . " Felon left without waiting for a response . He was n't funny about dealing with the soldiers in the crew , but he just did n't fuck with the bird niggaz . They were good for whatever they were good for , but that was as far as it went . Felon had gotten his hands dirty in the past , but now that he was getting his weight up a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The less he dealt with people , the less they would have to say about him . You could n't snitch on a nigga that you knew nothing about . That motto had saved him from seeing any real lengthy bids . Felon had been behind the wall , but never for more than a few months to a year or so at a time , and that had always been because of somebody else 's fuckup . Felon felt his cell phone vibrating and wondered who the hell could be ringing him at that hour of the morning . Felon looked at his caller ID , but did n't recognize the number . When he answered the call , his ears were assaulted by the sounds Spice 1 's " A Nigger Got No Heart . " He knew it could only be one crazy-ass broad . " What up , Kiki ? " " My nigga , Felon , " Kiki said on the other end . " What you doing up at this hour ? " " You know I do n't waste a day , ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you still wanted me to see about that thing , right ? " " For sure , ma . You got that ? " " Not yet , " she said looking out the window of her truck at a chromed-out Benz . " Me and Rah bout to handle that right now . Have my money when I hit the hood , nigga . " " I got you , Kiki . Thanks . " Felon hung up his phone and kept walking . Big Kiki was a part-time bouncer and a full-time criminal . She was an enforcer in the Twenty-Gang click . Both women and men feared Kiki on the streets . She was easily six feet tall and built to brawl . Kiki had a rep as being a knockout artist . Felon ducked into the store on the corner of 132nd and Madison Avenue . When he was out early enough , he would go into the store to get a coffee and a Daily News . He liked to spend money with the cats in that store , cause they treated everyone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sandwich , Felon took a minute to go through the paper . On one page he read about a family getting burned out of their home in Queens . On another page he read about a little girl getting hit with a stray bullet . As he thumbed toward the back he saw that the Knicks had lost to the Raptors by twenty . Felon decided against purchasing a newspaper that morning . The world was too damn depressing . Kiki hopped from the Eddie Bauer and looked around cautiously . They were in a quiet area of Brooklyn that consisted mostly of houses . She motioned for her partner Rah to follow . She and Rah looked like Laurel and Hardy trying to be discreet about sneaking up on someone 's car . While Kiki was a big woman , Rah was a petite young girl with big eyes . Kiki reached up under her sweatshirt and removed the " Slim-Jim " she had been concealing . She jacked the rod down into the space between the window and the door until the lock sprang . Kiki quickly slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbling with the proper wires , the car came to life . Kiki gave Rah the nod and she hopped back into Kiki 's truck . Kiki pulled off in the Benz , with Rah following in the truck . When the owner of the car later found out that his car had been jacked , he complained to the police that it was hood shit . But to the two ladies who would reap the rewards of the heist , it was just another day at the office . Spooky crept down 140th Street , making sure he stayed close to the buildings . At that time of morning , there were n't that many people about . Still , for the kind of bullshit Spooky was doing , he could n't run the risk of getting caught . He knew that if Felon or Butter caught wind of what he was doing , his life would n't be worth shit . Spooky continued to move up and down the block , serving the fiends as he went along . He kept two packs of bagged-up crack on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug into to serve each fiend . Both of the packs were identical . The only difference was that one package contained Felon 's work and the other pack contained Spooky 's . That 's why he had to make sure that he was on point . Felon had been kind to Spooky when he was down and out , and Spooky had repaid him by trying to slit his throat . He was selling his own work and packaging it to look like Felon 's . He was still moving work for Felon while he was hustling his wares , but it was still some underhanded shit . When Felon put Spooky on , he had promised to promote him once he had proven his worth . The promotion was taking a little too long for Spooky , so he went on the offensive . Spooky was only fifteen years old and still lived at home , so his bills were minimal , but to him he still needed shit . Spooky was a dude who had Gucci tastes , with a Kmart budget . He needed to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had planned , Sean 's exact words were , " You 're gon na fuck around and get murdered . " Sean would have no part in that scheme . Spooky had n't really given it much thought , though . He felt that Sean was just being a pussy , while he was a nigga with heart . At least that 's what was going on in his ignorant-ass mind . He figured that if he were to ever get caught , he might be able to talk his way out of it . Felon was far from a sucker , but he was a good dude . Spooky figured he 'd give his boss a lame-ass excuse about trying to show that he was on a come-up and needed the extra bread . Felon might beat the hell out of Spooky , but he would probably let him keep his life . Butter was another story altogether . A lot of niggaz in the hood is gangsta , but Butter was downright mean . That boy got some kinda strange thrill out of seeing people hurting . Spooky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Butter 's sister a bitch last summer . When Butter caught the kid , he made him run out onto the I-95 . The kid had made it almost all the way across when an eighteen-wheeler mangled him . It was a good bet that if Butter was set on the case , Spooky would surely meet a very similar fate . He just had to make sure that he stayed one step ahead of Felon and his bulldog .
