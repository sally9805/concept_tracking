The Blood Clot // There is fire in his eyes and light in his face . // The Secret History of the Mongols // Of the thousands of cities conquered by the Mongols , history only mentions one that Genghis Khan deigned to enter . Usually , when victory became assured , he withdrew with his court to a distant and more pleasant camp while his warriors completed their tasks . On a March day in 1220 , the Year of the Dragon , the Mongol conqueror broke with his peculiar tradition by leading his cavalry into the center of the newly conquered city of Bukhara , one of the most important cities belonging to the sultan of Khwarizm in what is now Uzbekistan . Although neither the capital nor the major commercial city , Bukhara occupied an exalted emotional position throughout the Muslim world as Noble Bukhara , the center of religious piety known by the epithet " the ornament and delight to all Islam . " Knowing fully the propaganda value of his actions by conquering and entering the city , Genghis Khan rode triumphantly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vendors ' stalls , to the large cluster of stone and brick buildings at the center of the city . // His entry into Bukhara followed the successful conclusion of possibly the most audacious surprise attack in military history . While one part of his army took the direct route from Mongolia to attack the sultan 's border cities head-on , he had secretly pulled and pushed another division of warriors over a distance longer than any other army had ever covered-two thousand miles of desert , mountains , and steppe-to appear deep behind enemy lines , where least expected . Even trade caravans avoided the Kyzyl Kum , the fabled Red Desert , by detouring hundreds of miles to avoid it ; and that fact , of course , was precisely why Genghis Khan chose to attack from that direction . By befriending the nomads of the area , he was able to lead his army on a hitherto unknown track through the stone and sand desert . // His targeted city of Bukhara stood at the center of a fertile oasis astride one of the tributaries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ruled by Turkic tribesmen in the newly created empire of Khwarizm , one of the many transitory empires of the era . The sultan of Khwarizm had , in a grievously fatal mistake , provoked the enmity of Genghis Khan by looting a Mongol trade caravan and disfiguring the faces of Mongol ambassadors sent to negotiate peaceful commerce . Although nearly sixty years old , when Genghis Khan heard of the attack on his men , he did not hesitate to summon his disciplined and experienced army once again to their mounts and to charge down the road of war . // In contrast to almost every major army in history , the Mongols traveled lightly , without a supply train . By waiting until the coldest months to make the desert crossing , men and horses required less water . Dew also formed during this season , thereby stimulating the growth of some grass that provided grazing for horses and attracted game that the men eagerly hunted for their own sustenance . Instead of transporting slow-moving siege engines and heavy equipment with them , the Mongols carried a faster-moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot from available materials . When the Mongols came to the first trees after crossing the vast desert , they cut them down and made them into ladders , siege engines , and other instruments for their attack . // When the advance guard spotted the first small settlement after leaving the desert , the rapidly moving detachment immediately changed pace , moving now in a slow , lumbering procession , as though they were merchants coming to trade , rather than with the speed of warriors on the attack . The hostile force nonchalantly ambled up to the gates of the town before the residents realized who they were and sounded an alarm . // Upon emerging unexpectedly from the desert , Genghis Khan did not race to attack Bukhara immediately . He knew that no reinforcements could leave the border cities under attack by his army , and he therefore had time to play on the surprise in a tortured manipulation of public fear and hope . The objective of such tactics was simple and always the same : to frighten the enemy into surrendering before an actual battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity , Genghis Khan 's army set many local people to flight toward Bukhara as refugees who not only filled the city but greatly increased the level of terror in it . By striking deeply behind the enemy lines , the Mongols immediately created havoc and panic throughout the kingdom . As the Persian chronicler Ata-Malik Juvaini described his approach , when the people saw the countryside all around them " choked with horsemen and the air black as night with the dust of cavalry , fright and panic overcame then , and fear and dread prevailed . " In preparing the psychological attack on a city , Genghis Khan began with two examples of what awaited the people . He offered generous terms of surrender to the outlying communities , and the ones that accepted the terms and joined the Mongols received great leniency . In the words of the Persian chronicler , " whoever yields and submits to them is safe and free from the terror and disgrace of their severity . " Those that refused received exceptionally harsh treatment , as the Mongols herded the captives before them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The tactic panicked the Turkic defenders of Bukhara . Leaving only about five hundred soldiers behind to man the citadel of Bukhara , the remaining army of twenty thousand soldiers fled in what they thought was still time before the main Mongol army arrived . By abandoning their fortress and dispersing in flight , they sprung Genghis Khan 's trap , and the Mongol warriors , who were already stationed in wait for the fleeing soldiers , cut them down at a nearly leisurely pace . // The civilian population of Bukhara surrendered and opened the city gates , but the small contingent of defiant soldiers remained in their citadel , where they hoped that the massive walls would allow them to hold out indefinitely against any siege . To more carefully assess the overall situation , Genghis Khan made his unprecedented decision to enter the city . One of his first acts on reaching the center of Bukhara , or upon accepting the surrender of any people , was to summon them to bring fodder for his horses . Feeding the Mongol warriors and their horses was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , by receiving the food and fodder , Genghis Khan signaled his acceptance of the people as vassals entitled to Mongol protection as well as subject to his command . // From the time of his central Asian conquests , we have one of the few written descriptions of Genghis Khan , who was about sixty years old . The Persian chronicler Minhaj al-Siraj Juzjani , who was far less kindly disposed toward the Mongols than the chronicler Juvaini , described him as " a man of tall stature , of vigorous build , robust in body , the hair on his face scanty and turned white , with cats ' eyes , possessed of dedicated energy , discernment , genius , and understanding , awe-striking , a butcher , just , resolute , an overthrower of enemies , intrepid , sanguinary , and cruel . " Because of his uncanny ability to destroy cities and conquer armies many times the size of his own , the chronicler also goes on to declare that Genghis Khan was " adept at magic and deception , and some of the devils were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of Bukhara , Genghis Khan rode up to the large mosque and asked if , since it was the largest building in the city , it was the home of the sultan . When informed that it was the house of God , not the sultan , he said nothing . For the Mongols , the one God was the Eternal Blue Sky that stretched from horizon to horizon in all four directions . God presided over the whole earth ; he could not be cooped up in a house of stone like a prisoner or a caged animal , nor , as the city people claimed , could his words be captured and confined inside the covers of a book . In his own experience , Genghis Khan had often felt the presence and heard the voice of God speaking directly to him in the vast open air of the mountains in his homeland , and by following those words , he had become the conqueror of great cities and huge nations . // Genghis Khan dismounted from his horse in order to walk into the great mosque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever entered in his life . Upon entering , he ordered that the scholars and clerics feed his horses , freeing them from further danger and placing them under his protection , as he did with almost all religious personnel who came under his control . Next , he summoned the 280 richest men of the city to the mosque . Despite his limited experience inside city walls , Genghis Khan still had a keen grasp of the working of human emotion and sentiment . Before the assembled men in the mosque , Genghis Khan took a few steps up the pulpit stairs , then turned to face the elite of Bukhara . Through interpreters , he lectured them sternly on the sins and misdeeds of their sultan and themselves . It was not the common people who were to blame for these failures ; rather , " it is the great ones among you who have committed these sins . If you had not committed great sins , God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you . " He then gave each rich man into the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him and collect his treasure . He admonished his rich prisoners not to bother showing them the wealth above the ground ; the Mongols could find that without assistance . He wanted them to guide them only to their hidden or buried treasure . // Having begun the systematic plundering of the city , Genghis Khan turned his attention to attacking the Turkic warriors still defiantly sealed inside the citadel of Bukhara . Although not familiar with the Mongols in particular , the people in the urbanized oases of central Asian cities like Bukhara and Samarkand had seen many barbarian armies come and go through the centuries . Prior tribal armies , no matter how brave or disciplined , never posed a severe threat because urban armies , so long as they had food and water , could hold out indefinitely behind the massive walls of their forts . By most measures , the Mongols should have been no match for the professionally trained career soldiers they encountered at Bukhara . Although the Mongols had excellent bows in general , each man was responsible for making or acquiring his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mongol army was composed of all the males of the tribe , who depended on the ruggedness of their upbringing herding animals for their training ; and while they were hardy , disciplined , and devoted to their tasks , they lacked the professional selection and training of the defenders of Bukhara . The greatest factor in favor of the soldiers holed up behind the massive stone walls of the citadel was that no tribal army had ever mastered the complex technology of siege warfare , but Genghis Khan had something to show them . // The attack was designed as a show of overwhelming strength for which the audience was not the already conquered people of Bukhara , but the still distant army and people of Samarkand , the next city on his march . The Mongol invaders rolled up their newly constructed siege engines-catapults , trebuchets , and mangonels that hurled not only stones and fire , as besieging armies had done for centuries , but also pots of burning liquids , exploding devices , and incendiary materials . They maneuvered immense crossbows mounted on wheels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladders from which they could shoot down at the defenders of the walls . At the same time that they attacked through the air , miners went to work digging into the earth to undermine the walls by sapping . During this awesome display of technological prowess in the air , on the land , and beneath the earth , Genghis Khan heightened the psychological tension by forcing prisoners , in some cases the captured comrades of the men still in the citadel , to rush forward until their bodies filled the moat and made live ramparts over which other prisoners pushed the engines of war . // The Mongols devised and used weapons from the different cultures with whom they had contact , and through this accumulation of knowledge they created a global arsenal that could be adapted to whatever situation they encountered . In their flaming and exploding weapons , the Mongols experimented with early forms of armaments that would later become mortars and cannons . In the description of Juvaini , we sense the confusion of the witnesses in accounting for exactly what happened around them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed from without by hard sticks thrust into the recesses , while from the belly of the furnace sparks shoot into the air . " Genghis Khan 's army combined the traditional fierceness and speed of the steppe warrior with the highest technological sophistication of Chinese civilization . Genghis Khan used his fast-moving and well-trained cavalry against the enemy 's infantry on the ground , while negating the protective power of the fortress walls with the new technology of bombardment using firepower and unprecedented machines of destruction to penetrate the fortress and terrorize its defenders . With fire and death raining down on the men in the citadel , the warriors of the sultan , in Juvaini 's words , quickly " drowned in the sea of annihilation . " // Genghis Khan recognized that warfare was not a sporting contest or a mere match between rivals ; it was a total commitment of one people against another . Victory did not come to the one who played by the rules ; it came to the one who made the rules and imposed them on his enemy . Triumph could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undeniable-or it was nothing . In battle , this meant the unbridled use of terror and surprise . In peace , it meant the steadfast adherence to a few basic but unwavering principles that created loyalty among the common people . Resistance would be met with death , loyalty with security . // His attack on Bukhara ranked as a success , not merely because the people of that city surrendered , but because when word of the Mongol campaign reached the capital of Samarkand , that army surrendered as well . The sultan fled his kingdom , and the Mongol juggernaut pushed onward . Genghis Khan himself took the main part of the army across the mountains of Afghanistan and on to the Indus River , while another detachment circled around the Caspian Sea , through the Caucasus Mountains , and onto the plains of Russia . For precisely seven hundred years , from that day in 1220 until 1920 , when the Soviets moved in , Genghis Khan 's descendants ruled as khans and emirs over the city of Bukhara in one of the longest family dynasties in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
