Mohammed Akber Ali and Shrikanth Sriram , the London duo known as Badmarsh &; Shri , do n't do scenes . They figured that out soon after the release of their first CD , Dancing Drums , in 1998 . The duo was waiting to play at a London night spot packed with would-be hipsters desperate to get a hit of a new music genre  --  dubbed " Asian underground " but often consisting of little more than DJs sampling Indian folk music over drum-'n ' - bass beats  --  that was then the rage in U.K. clubs . " There was a band on before us , " Sriram remembers . " And a couple of Asian guys came on with sitars . They did n't even know how to hold them . They twanged one note , and the crowd goes , ' Yeah , this is Asian underground . ' After two notes , they put down the sitars and out came the rock guitars . " To Sriram , a 32-year-old Bombay native who grew up surrounded by classical Indian music , it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any sense , " he says . " I 'm not a part of this movement . The further we stay away from it the better . " <P> They made the right choice . Since distancing themselves from the manufactured sounds and styles of London 's Asian club scene , the duo hase created its own , highly original kind of music . It 's a sonic masala of traditional tablas , sitars , flutes and strings stirred together with just about every spice in the Western pop pantry , including drum ' n ' bass , garage , funk and reggae . All the elements are on display on Signs ( Outcaste ) , their thrilling second CD . " This music works as well in Norway as it does in London or New York , " Sriram says . " People like to get their heads blown apart . " Says Ali : " We 're not making music in a particular genre for a particular group . " <P> In that sense , Badmarsh &; Shri belongs to a generation of young British-Asian acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ethnic underground to make music that bends  --  and transcends  --  traditional pop categories . South Asian culture suffuses almost every facet of modern British life : Bollywood movies outdraw West End musicals , and curry is the national cuisine . Now , with the novelty of the " Asian underground " fading , Asian musicians are demanding recognition as mainstream British artists with global appeal . Talvin Singh , the critically acclaimed London-based DJ and tabla virtuoso , says British-Asian pop " is the music of today . Whether it 's underground or overground , it 's creating a new spirit and science of making music . " <P> Badmarsh &; Shri are an unlikely team : the Yemeni-Indian Ali , 34 , grew up in East London listening to black dance music before becoming a DJ ; Sriram , who moved to London from India in 1997 , plays bass and has tastes that range from Rush to Herbie Hancock . After meeting in 1998 , they decided to record together  --  Ali spinning and mixing , Sriram laying down bass lines and melodies  --  and within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my human sampler , " Ali says . " Instead of sampling from vinyl , I sampled from him . "
