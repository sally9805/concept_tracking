Chapter One Spring 1741 ; Spring 1961 World was Moving I felt the edge slip sometimes . When I was there . Nothing obvious , just the disquieting feeling that something had come loose , something had shifted and reassembled itself beneath me . There are places like that . Places that fall apart and re-form right under your boots . Places that can remake you . I think now it 's because these places themselves are still undone , still being formed . The Pacific plate began its slow plunge under the American plate , revealing the red meat of the earth . Along the wound , volcanoes rose like cysts , spewing molten rock into cool water , creating the Aleutian chain seventy million years ago . Strewn like stepping-stones , the 1,400-mile island chain arched from the Alaskan Peninsula to the doorstep of Siberia . And then the winds began , so persistent , so fierce , the islands became the Birthplace of the Wind and the Cradle of Storms . The winds erode from above ; the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dying . The battle of fire and water is old and living . Both will keep killing . And keep giving life . This is the edge , the slip . They are , like us , unfinished . People do not possess such places but are possessed by them . I felt it when I was there . I imagine the Aleut people have been feeling it for thousands of years . And I believe some of them still remember the power that lurks in this land . When I first heard their story , I felt as if the wind were lifting a veil , revealing something I already knew . And some part of my brain stepped back from the edge of extinction and smiled . Their story takes a shape our instincts recognize . The whisper under a shout . And in my mind , I 'm standing again on a cliff overlooking that siren ocean , feeling the wind press into my lungs . And I , too , remember . It blows over the beach below on this sunny , cold afternoon long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks and sand . She and thirty others from her village have gathered here at Tumgax 's request . Another vision has come to him . " Something is coming , " Tumgax says , leaning forward to peer into each person 's eyes . " The wind will bring newcomers from beyond the sea , and everything will change . " Tekuxia shudders when the shaman tells of these visions . Her children whimper with nightmares after such talk . But she listens well . And she believes . " Last night I journeyed again to where the spirits talk . " Tumgax turns his face to search past the breakers , past the towering rocks guarding the village cove , toward the open ocean . " These newcomers will bring new ways . The People will take up their ideas , their clothing , their lives . Until no one remembers who we were . " Tekuxia shivers under the cold sun . The villagers know there exist people much different from themselves .

And she has heard the tales of a people to the west , beyond the last island . But these tales have grown so old that they now sound like myths serving only to warn the young men not to venture too far from home . " When they come , " Tumgax continues , " we will welcome them . We will embrace their God and their toion and everything will change . " As the gathering breaks , Tekuxia scoops up her little girl and holds her close , feeling the dark shiny hair under her cheek . Tekuxia does not fear for herself ; she feels certain her generation will pass before the change . But Aya . Aya will see it all . She sets the girl down and kneels in front of her . " Aya , you must remember what I am going to tell you . Say you will . " The girl looks up , surprised by her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These hands , " Tekuxia says , turning the sand-caked palms upward in her own , " in them you hold your fate , and in no one 's hands but your own does your future rest . Do you understand ? " Aya understands only the strange desperation in her mother 's voice , only the first notions of fear . But she nods . " Yes , Mama . " In the years to come , Aya will listen to her mother repeat this strange ceremony , the turning up of her palms and the heavy words . But she will not come to understand them until her mother is long gone and the change has blown down upon her like a williwaw . Hurl yourself forward 220 years and fly inland to another girl learning at her mother 's side . My mother 's legacy of wisdom was no less insistent , no less burdened by a maternal instinct to warn her daughter of what she fears .

" " Yes , Mama . " Two inches . Two inches . The water bed sloshes with the rhythm as I repeat the words in a whisper , scared to forget anything even then . " And , " my mother says , bending forward at the waist to invert her blond curls and burden them with spray , " this Aqua Net is the best shit on the market . " Aqua Net . Aqua Net . She takes my face between her two hands as she passes by me for the door . " Such a pretty girl , " she says , and I squint to see past the barriers of black-clumped lashes . I squint to see into the wreck of my mother 's eyes . She throws her customary parting over her shoulder as she leaves . " Be bad enough so they call you good . " The smell of perfume and hair spray and a protean dampness lingers in the room . Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
