The issues that will be slugged out in federal district court in San Francisco this week sound a little too pop culture to be all that serious . How many music CDs are students buying these days in a record store outside the Syracuse University campus ? How do Chuck D and Courtney Love want to see their music distributed ? What does Metallica think about fans ' making bootleg recordings of its concerts ? <P> But do n't be fooled . This legal face-off between the music industry and Napster may turn out to be one of the great trials of the digital age . Earlier this year the Microsoft antitrust case spelled out the rules for how high-tech companies can and ca n't compete with one another . The Napster case may make an equally bold statement about what intellectual property rights will exist in the new economy . If the ruling goes the industry 's way , as many expect , it could bring an end to the brief era in which all sorts of music were readily available for free download on the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napster . <P> Napster is , of course , the wildly popular file-sharing service whose 20 million users have downloaded some half a billion songs  --  most of them copyrighted , all of them free . To the music-industry plaintiffs in this week 's suit  --  including Warner Records , which , like this magazine , is a unit of Time Warner  --  services like Napster are simply high-tech piracy . The industry is worried that in the future , only a few CDs will be sold ; everyone else will download from the Net . In this suit , the Recording Industry Association of America and 18 record labels are asking Judge Marilyn Hall Patel to hold that Napster has engaged in music piracy . And order it to desist . And assess damages of up to $100,000 per downloaded song . <P> Napster , which was developed by 19-year-old Shawn Fanning in 1999 , lost a key early ruling in the case . It had tried to argue that it was a " mere conduit " for the songs exchanged over it . Just as a phone company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , Napster argued that it should n't be responsible for piracy its users engaged in . But Judge Patel rejected that claim . Napster responded with a bold move of its own . It hired star litigator David Boies  --  fresh from his victory in the Microsoft antitrust case  --  to represent it . <P> Boies , not surprisingly , thinks Napster can and should win the case . He begins on an almost philosophical note : he complains that the entertainment industry has a knee-jerk instinct to try to stand in the way of technological progress . It 's something the music industry has been accused of since 1908 , when it went to the Supreme Court to argue , unsuccessfully , that its copyrights were being violated by player-piano rolls . More recently , in 1984 , the movie studios went to the high court in an unsuccessful attempt to block Sony from selling VCRs . There 's a pattern here , Napster 's defenders say : copyright holders have always resisted new technology and then  --  as with the movie studios and videotapes  --  they end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
