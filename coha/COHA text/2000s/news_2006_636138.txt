<p> Rating four Essential <p> Rating three Good <p> Rating two Fair <p> Rating one Poor <p> ROCK <p> Golden Smog , " Another Fine Day " ( Lost Highway ) Rating two 1/2 <p> The first release from this alt-country supergroup was a novelty back in 1992 , but it was a revealing one , with moonlighting members of the Jayhawks , Wilco and Soul Asylum paying tribute to their music heroes while getting drunk and having some laughs . By the second and third albums , it was harder to forgive the sloppiness and blatant derivation . Recorded in Spain by core members Gary Louris , Dan Murphy , Marc Perlman and Kraig Johnson , " Another Fine Day " breaks no new ground , but it is a tighter , more spirited and better-crafted effort than " Down by the Old Mainstream " ( 1996 ) or " Weird Tales " ( 1998 )  --  probably because these fellas ' primary bands have more or less dropped off the radar , so there 's no need for them to hold out on the best material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't include Chicagoan Jeff Tweedy , whose band Wilco is still very much at the top of its game ; he makes a few stray appearances , co-writing " Listen Joe " with Louris , and coming in to make some unspecified contributions at the tail end of the recording . He is n't really missed , and about half of this disc  --  including the jangly opener " You Make It Easy , " the psychedelic " Beautiful Mind " and " Cure for This , " which features gorgeous vocals from Muni Loco , the wife of Spanish producer Paco Loco  --  easily stand as the best music the group has given us . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> R &B; <p> India.Arie , " Testimony : <p> Vol. 1 , Life &; Relationship " ( Motown ) Rating one 1/2 <p> You ca n't fault India.Arie for a lack of earnestness ; there 's hardly a verse on the acoustic soul singer 's third album , which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart last week , where she is n't baring her soul about the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , she does n't have much to say about the human condition beyond the sort of " improve yourself , save the world " pop-psych platitudes so regularly dispensed by Oprah and other denizens of daytime television . <p> " There 's hope / It does n't cost a thing to smile / You do n't have to pay to laugh / You better thank God for that , " Arie croons midway through the disc in the typically lulling " There 's Hope . " So it goes in tune after tune , including the unremarkable cover of Don Henley 's " Heart of the Matter , " with Arie admitting that , yes , the unnamed cad broke my heart , but Christ forgives , and so can I. Noble sentiments , perhaps , but they just do n't feel real , and you wish that she 'd flash just a little bit of anger and slap the bum upside the head . <p> Despite the plethora of guests , including Keb ' Mo ' , Bonnie Raitt , Bela Fleck 's Victor Wooten and country pickers Rascal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial , bland and generic as the self-help advice . Arie 's octave-spanning , smooth and often very sultry voice remains a distinctive and appealing instrument . If only she 'd put it to better use . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> WORLD <p> Lenine , " Lenine " ( Six Degrees ) Rating four <p> He calls his music " musica planetaria Brasileira "  --  a clever riff on MPB , the acronym for the socially conscious , lyrically dense and rhythmically diverse genre known as Brazilian popular music . The artist known as Lenine has been pegged as Brazil 's equivalent to Prince , but that comparison hardly does him justice . Though he 's just as funky , if not more so , than Master P , Lenine draws on a wider universe of beats , including maracatu , baiao , frevo , forro and samba ( all native to Brazil ) , and reanimates them against a framework of rock , rap and electronica . Thematically , he 's just as diverse , with a salute to Jackson do Pandeiro , a pioneer of Brazilian regional music ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as American cult fave Roger Corman ( whose 1963 film " The Man With the X-Ray Eyes " inspired " O Homem Dos Olhos de Raio X " ) . <p> " Lenine , " the **53;2320;TOOLONG first American release , collects tracks from his three Brazilian discs , but this is not just some slapped-together compilation . Instead , it 's a sampler of a modern master who continues to reinvent Brazilian music with the distinct vibe of the northeast . <p> Championed by global tastemakers such as Caetano Veloso and David Byrne , Lenine has already won the Sharp Prize ( Brazil 's top music award ) , as well as two Latin Grammys . In the United States , he remains largely unknown , unfortunately . But " Lenine , " one of the year 's best discs thus far ( in any category ) , should change that status . <p> Laura Emerick <p> Note : Lenine will make his Chicago debut Aug. 5 at HotHouse , 31 E. Balbo . <p> BLUES <p> Jeremy Spencer , " Precious Little " ( Blind Pig ) Rating four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is treated to this comeback album by another famous British rock dropout , Jeremy Spencer . The Fleetwood Mac guitarist , whose virtuoso slide work was featured on the classic LPs " Then Play On " and " Kiln House , " has seldom been heard from since leaving the group in 1971 . <p> Spencer says God told him to do the Notodden Blues Festival in Norway in August 2005 , although the man upstairs failed to supply his dream lineup of Chicago blues survivors such as Pinetop Perkins and Hubert Sumlin . Nonetheless , the Norwegian musicians who backed Spencer for the gig were plenty good enough to take into a studio in Oslo , where they recorded this disc of seven Spencer originals and five traditional tunes . <p> The reclusive guitarist clearly had been developing this material for years . There 's " Serene Serena , " a takeoff on the traditional " Corrina Corrina " about a girl that Spencer sees as a Florence Nightingale type in Bosnia , and " Maria de Santiago , " the melody for which came to Spencer during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " continues a Spencer tradition of reinventing Fabian material . This is pure , unadulterated , mostly acoustic blues straight from the heart of an artist whose return is so welcome , and so needed . <p> Jeff Johnson <p> JAZZ <p> Von Freeman , " Good Forever " ( Premonition ) Rating four <p> Chicago 's great , beloved Vonski continues his late surge , unexpectedly , with an album of ballads and blues . The 83-year-old saxophonist has always had a place in his heart for the soft stuff , but his idiosyncratic reputation is built on his tougher tenorisms . Here , backed by the New York trio that helped make his 2003 " Great Divide " memorable , he opens his sails on seldom heard old favorites of his . <p> They include " I 'll Never Be Free , " a 1950 hit for Dinah Washington ( as well as the duo of Tennessee Ernie Ford and Kay Starr ) and " Why Try to Change Me Now , " Frank Sinatra 's 1952 finale for Columbia . The slow tempos allow the listener to dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodic swagger . <p> Here and there , veteran pianist Richard Wyands seems out of sync , but along with onetime Miles Davis drummer Jimmy Cobb and bassist John Webber , he provides a graceful setting for Freeman 's pearls of uncommon wisdom . When the sentimental Charles Chaplin warhorse , " Smile , " sounds this good ( a little rhythmic ingenuity works wonders ) , you know things are clicking . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Note : Von Freeman will perform Aug. 3 in Millennium Park . <p> BLUES-ROCK <p> Omar &; the Howlers , <p> " Bamboozled  --  Live in Germany " ( Ruf ) Rating three <p> John Lee Hooker spawned two generations of white-boy Boogieman imitators , from ZZ Top to Omar &; the Howlers , another little ol ' band out of Texas that sticks closer to the Hook 's brand of foot-stomping blues . <p> Guitarist-vocalist Kent " Omar " Dykes and his Austin-based trio pay homage to their hero with " Boogie Man , " one of 15 tracks on this live disc , recorded last fall in Gottingen , Germany . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Monkey Land , " where they harness all their power into nearly seven minutes of roiling , rollicking good-time boogie . They sustain their energy even when they slow it down for the Chicago-style blues numbers " East Side Blues " and " South Congress Blues . " It 's not the original , but it 's a more than passable adaptation . <p> Jeff Johnson Photo : ***** New Photo ***** ; Photo : ( Von Freeman , " Good Forever " ) ; Photo : ( Jeremy Spencer , " Precious Little " ) ; Photo : ( Lenine , " Lenine " ) ; Photo : ( Vol. 1 , Life &; Relationship " ) ; Photo : ( Golden Smog , " Another Fine Day " )
