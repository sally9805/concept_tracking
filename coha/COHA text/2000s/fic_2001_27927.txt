1 . KITSUNE 'S DIARY There were four of us . Grandfather was an old fox , of perhaps eight or nine years . Gray ran along his narrow jaw and in a broad streak from his black nose to between his black-tipped ears ; it frosted his pelt so that he seemed almost outlined in gray light . His joints stiffened on cold wet days , and he liked to doze in the spring sunlight when he could . He was missing a toe on one of his front paws . When I was little and first realized he did n't have the same toes I had , I asked him why , and he told me a tanuki-badger bit it off , but I think he was teasing . He was like that . Mother was simple , even for a fox . My brother and I watched her sometimes catch and lose a mouse a half-dozen times before she remembered to bite it while she still had her paws on it . We were amazed sometimes that she had survived long enough to bear us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mice and chipmunks and other small prey . The grasses around our home were too long and dense for hawks , and the few humans who lived nearby chased off anything larger . Our only competition was a family of cats led by a black-and-white spotted female . They lived in a deserted outbuilding near the people , but they hunted in our range , and ignored us rigidly . The cats chased and lost mice , too . I think this was intentional for them , but who can understand cats ? Even as a woman I have never understood them . My brother and I had been born the winter before , down in the still air of the den . At first there were four kits , Ithink . One died early , before we saw daylight ; she smelled sick and then she was gone . Another died when we were barely old enough to suck the juices from meat our grandfather brought us . That kit was the boldest of us ; one night when he was still much too young he followed our grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my remaining brother was a gawky thing of long legs and oversized ears . His fur had not yet filled into its rusty adult coat , so his brush and neck-ruff were thin and spiky , dun-colored . I suppose I looked the same , but taller at the shoulder , heavier-boned . It was easy for me to pin him , and he usually ended the play by baring his belly to me . He was quiet , my brother . I did not see all this back then . They were my family : why should I think of them ? If anything . I associated them with their smells . Grandfather was bright and dusty , like damp leaves fallen underfoot . Mother was drying mud . Brother was tree bark and woodsmoke . Words , words , words . There were no words then , just sensation : smell , sight , experience , day and night , as flat and complex as a brocade held too close to the eyes for focus , or a rainstorm full in the face . All details , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I try to describe the fabric to you , but words will not make you wet or shelter you from the rain . We lived in a tangle of tunnels and rooms hollowed out of packed dirt . Everything was widetoo wide , said Grandfather , who never did anything to change itand worn smooth , and it smelled of a hundred generations of foxes . Our sleeping chamber was nearly at the bottom , lined with dead leaves and shed hair . We could all sleep together in it , but Grandfather no longer slept well , and he liked to lie nearer the entrance , where he could crawl out and stretch his legs when he needed . The den was pitch-dark . Surrounded by the smells of my family and burrow , I lay inside on spring days : dozed and waited for the crisp scents of dusk . Filtered through the fur of my brother 's haunch , I smelled the air outside , sweet and sharp . Nights we went out . Mother and Grandfather hunted , sometimes together but often alone , one leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ den . Mother never had anything to spare , but Grandfather usually returned dragging a soft-boned kiji-pheasant or a half-eaten hare , which he threw down for us to bicker over . We caught things on our own , as well : fledglings fallen from their nests , mice , voles . We learned to stamp for worms , and to catch birds , and to cache our kills for leaner days . I played with and ate the blue-black beetles that came my way , felt the smooth knotting of my joints operating , wrestled with my brother for the experience of hunting . I was learning to be a fox . Our burrow was dug under a structure that was flat and black over our heads , supported by a forest of tree-thick pillars , each resting on a rock . When I was old enough to be curious about this , I jumped up into the structure . I saw and smelled a cavern supported by pillars and roofed with dead grasses a tree 's height over my head . The floor under my toes was of boxwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack in the floor I heard my brother barking at my grandfatherimpatient little noises . I scratched at the crack . Paws padded below . A nose snuffled upward . " Sister ? " " I 'm walking on you ? " I could n't understand this . " Where are you ? " I did n't know what to say . This floor I stood on was the roof over the burrow , I knewthere was my brother , after allhow could it be else ? A scrambling noise behind me . " It is a building , " Grandfather said , and he stretched and walked across to me . " A house . Humans make them . " Brother clambered up after him . I looked around . There were no walls , just empty screen frames and lattices . Beyond them I saw other buildings , roofed and walled and raised on posts , with covered walkways that led from one to the next . " This is a den , " I said , realizing it . " The big buildings are chambers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnels . Or trails . " Brother sniffed at a pillar 's base and lifted his leg against it . " How did they make this place ? " " And why ? " I demanded . " If it 's a burrow , it 's open to everything . How can it be safe ? " " They were humans , they feared nothing . But it was not like this , back then . It was closed in with walls they could slide away or remove . " " How did they do that ? " Brother asked . " How did they do any of this ? " I sniffed a lintel rubbed shiny by passing feet . Even now I smelled the shadows of people , ghosts in my nose . Grandfather made a face , as if he 'd eaten something bitter . " Magic . " " Humans do n't have magic , " I said scornfully . " Magic is spring turning to summer , day and night . " " There are a lot of sorts of magic , little bug-eater . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , then ? " Brother asked . " They have clever paws , " he said . " They change things with them . " I inspected my own paws , cinnamon-colored with black-edged toes and ragged claws . Not clever , not magical . " But how ? " He bared his teeth : not hostile yet , but tired of the topic . " Give it a rest , Granddaughter . " Brother was marking every pillar , sharp little squirts of urine . I should check his marks , I knew . And Grandfather ? He was temperamental at all times and smelled irritable now , like a high wind filled with dust , still a long way away . I should leave Grandfather alone , I knew . But how could I ? " I just want to know how their paws are clever " I stopped when he took a step toward me . " Well , then , what other magics are there ? " " None that concern you , " he said dampingly . " The people will never be back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past the wall " Brother came to sit next to us , lolling his tongue . " This is like that , is n't it ? Where they livethose are dens , too , are n't they ? " " Mere servants ' quarters , " Grandfather snorted . " Wretched drafty barns . They bring their stock in to sleep under the same roof . " " I do n't understand . Servants ? " I said , but he continued without listening . " This " he looked around us , at the empty neglected buildings and walkways " is where the master and mistress lived . They were sweet-smelling , sweet as flowers out of season . Her hair was black as my feet and fell clear to the ground when she stood . Not a knot or tangle in it . They wore fabrics like spiderwebs . Gossamer . Their lives were a thousand kinds of magic . Poetry , calligraphy , moon-viewing , archery games in the wisteria courtyard " Poetry ? Moon-viewing ? How could I imagine what these things were ? Brother asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it was as if it were spiderweb . " My brother pressed his ears back against his skull . " That does n't make any sense . " " Not to you . It is as though you see me and smell pine , as though eyes and nose fail to agree . Which is real ? Am I your grandfather , or am I a pine ? " My brother whined and backed away . " You 're " I said , and stopped . Thinking like this made me afraid , made me want to run or bite , to break the tension inside . " Just because you do not understand a thing does not mean it 's not real , " Grandfather finally said . " How do you know all this ? " I asked . " They were here , " he said irritably . " I saw them . Noise all the time , bustle . We had to watch ourselves , not to be caught , or they would kill us . " " They do n't sound so dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even the humans on the other side of the wall are not dangerous if you stay out of their way , and they are much more active than this master ' and mistress . ' " He grabbed me by the ruff and forced me down . I yelped . " What do you know , little milk-sucker ? They are the most dangerous of allmore dangerous than bears . " I abased myself until his grip loosened and I squirmed free . " If this was their den , " Brother asked , " where are they now ? " " Gone , " Grandfather said . " There 's nothing left here . Come down . " Brother moved to the edge . " Why would they leave this place ? " " Who knows ? " he said irritably . " I was not much older than you when they left . " A breeze ruffled my fur . I shivered . " What if they return ? Their den is right over ours . " " They will never come back . " Grandfather dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when I was no more than a fox . In the waking world I never looked at the skywhy would I ? There was no prey therebut in this dream I did look . A star hung , dim as marsh gas , in the red-black glow of the sky ; in the east , the moon rose over a mountain , and the moon and the star were the same size . I stood on the mountain I had just watched the moon rise over , and the path was cold under my toes . I stepped forward , but my way was barred by a fox made of moonlight that smelled of nothing . " Make a wish , little sister , " the fox said . I thought . " To eat well and sleep safe . " Heshe ? laughed at me . " Never mind , then . " " Wait ! " I said , but the fox turned to a flower and vanished , and I woke , my family 's smells in my nostrils . I did not know what it meantdid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a meaning . But I also did not forget it . Now I wonder : do all foxes dream like this ? I only know I did . The house ( and our den ) was in a huge space enclosed by tumbledown fences made of bamboo and hinoki-cedar latticework . I was careful when I asked questions about the human constructions around us because Grandfather cuffed me down if I showed too much interest ; but he took me hunting once , and I managed to learn that the space had been gardens . People had torn up the plants and paths and streams of the place and replaced them with new paths and plants , and rerouted the stream . " But why ? " I asked my grandfather . " Because they could do it , " he snapped , and I knew to let it be . The sweet-water brook led from the topmost corner of the enclosure , under the raised floor of one of the deserted buildings , and through three little lakes , one after the other . Mandarin ducks nested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tried to explore or ( more often ) to eat their feckless ducklings . A trail strode across the lakes ' tops , lifted above the water on structures . " What is it ? " I asked Grandfather , when I saw the first one . " Bridge . " I stepped onto it , and felt the same cool smoothness under my toes I 'd felt in the house . Huge murky shapes moved in the weed-clogged water below me . " Fish , " Grandfather told me . " Eat them if you find them on the shore , but you can not go in after themlike hunting a shadow . " The rest of the garden was trees and long-dead grasses pushed aside by new growth . An overgrown path led down from the main house past the lakes and to a collapsed gate at the foot of the garden ; other small paths trailed off one way and another . They all seemed to go nowhere and then suddenly stop ; if it had not been for the large stones the humans laid flat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not trails at all . One dusk it was cold and raining . I woke up before the others and left the den , and sat at the edge of the overhang , looking across the clearing around the house to the rain-heavy grasses beyond . The air smelled cold , like molds and wet dust . I snapped at the puffs of fog my breath made before I got bored . A female rabbit , wood pigeon-gray , hunched over a clump of grass at the edge of our clearing . They never came this close to our den . I think the rain must have washed down our smell , and the rabbit must have been half-grown ( and possibly simple , like Mother ) , not to know that foxes lived here . Even in the rain , the sweet smell of freshly cropped grass drifted down the slight breeze to me . It was n't that I was hungry yet : I had not even thought of food before I dropped to my belly and inched forward . It was the fox-blood . What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell the rabbit 's sweet-musky fur , and see its whiskers quiver as it nibbled . Its head came up . It fixed me with a dark eye . I held still , staring back with the fixing-gaze , the gaze that holds an animal to be killed . Killer : prey . And then a rain droplet gathered in the fold of my eyelid , tickling . So I blinked . And the rabbit was gone . In a single leap it was lengths away from me ; a second , and it was lost in the weeds . Water sprayed up from its path . I chased it through thick mats of grass just in time to see it dive under a tall black stone in a clearing . I dug frantically at the hole it had vanished into . I was soaked to the skin and shivering before I gave up . The rock was riddled with little openings and fissures . Tiny pools had gathered in the pockmarks ; mosquito larvae hung on the pools ' many surfaces . There were no trees for paces all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone . It was full dark by the time I got back to the shelter of the den . My family was awake . Grandfather stood looking out from under the building . Mother sat with a hind leg held rigid to bite at a flea . Brother played with a curved stick , bouncing at one end so that the other popped up and caught him from behind . I told them about the rabbit , the dark stone . " It is hopeless chasing a rabbit near that , " Grandfather said . " Why ? " I licked my paw to warm it . " They have a safe warren there . Deep , buried under that rock , so you ca n't dig after them . Your only hope is to catch them away from it . " " It is a moon-rock . " It was my mother . I sniffed at her : she never said things to us , nothing that made sense , anyway . " It lived on the moon until it fell off and landed here , but it remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rabbit lives on the moon , and it protects them . " " What 's she talking about ? " my brother asked . Grandfather hunched a shoulder irritably , as if to say , " Do not ask me . " " God , " Mother answered . " The rabbit-god lives on the moon and watches them . " My brother snarled and snapped at the ground , nervous at a thing he could not fight , could not even find . A cold wind ruffled my wet fur . Life was a practical thing to us foxes : what could a god be ? I 'd never smelled one . She answered without my speaking . " What do rabbits see when they die ? Their god . Tanuki-badgers have them . Mice . Oxen . Men . Birds , no . Catsno one can tell " I could not help the hairs rising along my spine , my ears flattened against my skull . " Do foxes ? " " There is no such thing as gods . " Grandfather made our mother drop in submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took me all night to get warm . Beyond the fence there was a mountain to one side and behind us , covered with pine trees and ivy-hung cypress . As my brother and I learned to hunt , we followed the deer paths and caught baby rabbits , and once ate part of a dead fawn some other animal had killed . There was a long outcropping of dull red stone and a path of pounded dirt along the ridge that smelled of people , though we never saw any . Past the ruined gate and fence at the bottom of the gardens were rice fields . People were always fussing over them : making little rows of dirt , and pouring manure mixed with water onto the slick earth . One day they redirected the stream where it exited the garden , so that it flowed through the fields , to make them a mesh of small shallow lakes . Gnats and mosquitoes bred and rose in clouds . I watched uguisu-nightingales and enamel-bright dragonflies chase the insects ; this made more sense to me than the incomprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a dragonfly once : it was sharp , hot , prickly on my tongue . On the other side from the mountain , beyond a fence made of pine strips woven together , was a big pounded-dirt area surrounded by clumps of structures smaller and closer to the ground than those on our side of the fence . This was where the other people , the " servants , " lived . I occasionally saw them : more often I smelled them , along with woodsmoke and feces and fowl and big animals , oxen . Human smells . Sometimes at night , greasy-scented yellow light flickered through the lattices of their buildings , inconstant as foxfire , the glow of marsh gas at night . My brother and I crept along the fringe of the open dirt area to hide under a glossy-leafed bush that brushed the house 's wall . There was a constant low-pitched babble inside , a rippling noise like water or birds chattering . " What is that noise ? " my brother breathed . " The humans make it ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , in the room , face-to-face . Why would they need to bark like that ? " he asked . " Maybe they are like dogs and bark for boredom ? " Foolish to ask : he knew no more than I. " Let 's crawl under the floorboards , maybe we can hear more . " My brother hunched his back and lowered his ears . " Grandfather says they 're dangerous . " " We 're fast and clever . " " Grandfather says " I scoffed : " He 's old . Maybe things scare him that we do n't need to be afraid of . " " But he 's so wise " " But he 's not here , and I 'm stronger and bigger than you , and I say we can do it . " My brother shook his head , as if clearing his Face of clinging webs . " No . No . " He turned and ran . I eased into the crawl space , but learned nothing ; and when I came back later , Grandfather smelled the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he was old , but he was still the head of our family . After that I learned to stay upwind of the house . This was our lives . My brother and I got better at hunting . I explored the garden and the woods and fields beyond with the others and alone . I learned many useful smells : rabbit droppings , egg yolk from hatchings , the scent-marks of tanuki-badgers and wolves ( though we never saw any of themthey lived deeper in the forest , and , Grandfather said , only came down when the food was not good there ) . I killed and ate one of the black-and-white cat 's kittens ; a gamy mouthful of fur and half-digested mouse , it did not seem worth the effort , so I avoided them after that . My brother was stung by a wasp when he was up in the deserted house over our heads renewing his marks ; he was sick for a day and a night . I watched the humans when I could get away with it , but with less interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the rabbits that fed near the moon-rock . These were at least edible , relevant to a fox . The houses and verandas , sheds , fences and gardens of the residenceall the things the humans had builtmeant little to my brother and me : they were as unchanging as the standing rocks in the woods . I looked at everything , smelled everything , marked everything . I did not think much , back then . The season warmed , and I grew . I was still a Fox . Nothing changed . 2 . SHIKUJO 'S PILLOW BOOK The News Year 's appointments : My husband did badly in the New Year 's appointments , and when the court was finished with making up its rolls , no position had been found for himnot even the ignominy of a provincial governorship . This was quite surprising , of course : his family is excellent and highly regarded by the retired emperor ( if not the current one ) . One can only imagine that he antagonized some important figure in court . Knowing my husband , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , but from sheer carelessness . I think it even more likely that his current unhappiness has much to do with it . When two men of equal quality are proposed for the same job , why would it be given to the individual who appears more likely to cast aside the miseries of the world and flee to a life of contemplation in a monastery ? And his unhappiness has been obvious enough to his wife and household : my husband has little artifice and I expect it is nearly as obvious to his peers and superiors at court . Or it might be a random matter . It is not unheard-of for a worthy man to be denied a position due to a simple oversight . Far more unusual was my husband 's response . Other men would have stayed in the capital and campaigned for a good position in the autumn appointments or even next year 's ; instead he decided to go to the estate his father left him , off in the mountains of Hida province . He did not insist that I ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the proper thing to do . But on that spring night when he told me of this , I said nothing . Our son asleep on the mats between us , I watched the first cherries blooming , their blossoms glowing cold and pale as snow in the moonlight . " Are you upset ? " he asked me . A good wife is never upset , never unsettled , and I was , in truth , both . And a good husband never corners his wife in this fashion , forcing her to decide between what is correct and what is true . " Of course not , " I said . His unhappiness affects us all . 3 . KITSUNE 'S DIARY It was the time when the humans move the rice plants from the seeding beds to the flooded fields . I heard them down past the ruined gate and fence , sloshing through the belly-deep ( for me ) water and making their barking noises back and forth . The air was cool and heavy with humidity . Everything smelled new , freshwet dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the den ; my grandfather beside me , I lay beside one of the pillars , belly-down to the clammy dirt . A mosquito bit my nose . I snapped at the sharp itch of it . " Listen ! " My grandfather came to his feet , ears pricked forward , toward the fields . " What ? " The humans ' barking was suddenly louder and higher-pitched , but that could be anything . It happened every day . " Horses . Oxen . Carts , " my grandfather said . I had no idea what a horse was . I saw nothing , just the trees and lakes and grasses of the garden stretching to the broken gate . I strained to hear past the white hiss of the mist . An animal , then several , thundered up the dirt path on the other side of the fence . Their hooves hit heavy as oxen , but in the delicate rhythm of trotting deer . Carts rumbled . The sounds settled across from the gate . People barked some more . " What does it mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my grandfather said . " Humans . " " But there are already people here . " " Stay here . " He vanished in the thick grass . Behind me , Brother popped his head from the den 's entrance . " What " " Stay here , " I snarled , in the best imitation I had of my grandfather 's authority , and followed him . I caught up as we threaded between the lakes . He bared his teeth and flattened his ears at me in disapproval . I was afraid , but I flattened my ears back at him and continued . Two huge shaggy hinoki-cedars , their branches bent to the ground , flanked the tumbled gate . We bellied into one of them , and crawled forward to watch . The horse turned out to be pretty much what it sounded like : ox and deer . It smelled like sweat and grass , and was the yellow-orange of persimmons . Other horses trotted up , and the men sitting on their backs barked at the peasants in the muddy rice fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and its rider . The man was dressed in textures I had never seen before . The people who lived in the cookhouse wore simple clothes in flower-colors of indigo and white . They shed them like skins when they liked , and hung them in the sun and wind . But these robespale purple hammered silk that looked like the skin of frost over water , and an oiled cotton cloak colored gray-green , with a knot of dried grass sewn to the center of its backthese were utterly new . " The master of this house . " Grandfather smelled old , defeated . " They have returned . We are lost . " " What ? " He snarled silence . Two oxen pulling a small closed carriage drew up behind the horsemen . Walking men chattered . Carts and carriages rumbled to a stop on the path . The manthe master , Grandfather 'd saidhad turned toward us . His narrow eyes gleamed black , dark as a tsumi-hawk 's . He was looking at the ruined gate . At us . I recognized that look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is where we would die . There would be shouts and then the feel of cold metal , arrows dropping us as surely as they dropped the golden eagle we 'd once found dying in the garden . And then his face turned , and he looked somewhere else . " What " I said again , but this time in wonder . " Come . " My grandfather backed out of the pile . He was more careful , going back to the den . 4 . SHIKUJO 'S PILLOW BOOK One wrote this : One wrote this on first seeing the home she left all those years ago : Is the garden lost or merely hidden by the year 's thick grasses ? And this question only delays the next : which would one prefer ? This should be a simple enough question to answer : I am sure that civilization must always be preferable to barbarity . 5 . THE NOTEBOOK OF KAYA NO YOSHIFUJI The trip from the capital to the country place has taken two reeks . It is slow traveling with my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to that ) we travel only a few miles a day , at a deliberate walking pace , and stop well before dark at a convenient temple or a farmhouse . Some days we do not travel at all , if there is a tabu , or if my wife or one of her more valued attendants feels indisposed . It is easier for me : I ride my pretty Kiku , Chrysanthemum . Her gait is good for a yellow horse ( which are notoriously inconstant ) , smooth and fluid . Her saddle is built up in such a way that only a sack of rice could fall when she walks , so the fact that I am not a good rider does not matter . I know I should have taken a carriage . Someone not a misfit would have ridden in an ox-carriage for the endless hours of this trip : as my wife has to , as my son has to . While a gentleman may know how to ride ( it comes in handy on occasion ) , very few " gentlemen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse 's back , given a long journey without urgency like this one . My son , Tadamaro , who is eight and curious about everything , has pushed aside the bamboo blind that serves as the front of his carriage ; now he leans out on the carriage 's kite's-tail shafts staring at everything around him , careless of the rain that soaks his robes . He has never been to the country , so all of itthe rutted , muddy road ; the half-hidden farmhouses and shrines ; the wildness of the world itselfis new to him . Every so often , his nurse 's hands appear and pull at his robe . I can not hear her , but remembering my own nurse when I was small , I can imagine what she says to him . My wife 's carriage is quiet . She undoubtedly sits on a tiny cushion , in a space packed full of ladies-in-waiting . Like salted fish in a barrel , if one can say such a thing of women so delicate and cultured . Air comes in through the weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small grille set in the front . The sights through the grille are all she sees on this trip : the ears and backs of the oxen , the backs of the drivers ' heads as they walk alongside with their long switches looped in their hands , the dirt path and the endless reeking rice fields . I imagine all trips look pretty much the same to women . Still , women are used to sitting in the dark and thinking their thoughts . I do not know if all this bothers her . I do not know if she even tries to look out the grille . But it would bother me , so I ride Kiku and look around me , and try not to think too much about leaving the capital . What can they do to me , if I am seen riding as if I were a servant or a messenger ? I left the capital in disgrace anyway .

There was no position for me , but that is more an embarrassment than a disgrace . The situation is fairly common in a government with fewer positions than candidates . Most men failing to receive a position in the New Year 's appointments wail and clutch at their artfully disordered robes at the shame of it all , while their friends commiserate and cast doubts on the propriety of the selection process . The failed candidates then redouble their efforts to be appointed next time . And by the next year , the scandal ( if such it can be considered , when it is both common and boring ) is forgotten , replaced by old Lady Plum-blossom 's fling with a guardsman half her age , or the doubts regarding the father of the lovely Lady Cherry 's baby . I could have stayed , but I was miserable anyway . Perhaps I am trying to match my inner misery with my outside circumstances : at any rate , I seem resolved to make things as bad as they can possibly be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this self-imposed exile . We are in the Tani valley , deep in Hida provincewhich is to say , in the heart of nowhere . Under a heavy silver sky , clouds cling to the slopes around us , shredding like thin silk on the jagged tops of the pines . The mountains that lift to the silver sky are brilliant as lacquer , the greens all bright as snake skins , mingling with foaming banks of pink and white spirea and yellow yamabuki and the subtler pink of wild cherries . Smoke ropes upward in the thick tendrils that form in cool humid air . It trails from the local peasants ' houses and the nearby shrines : Inari Shrine ; Amida Shrine . When my wife and I lived here before , I walked the forested paths and visited all these places . It has been a long time , but I still remember the shapes of the mountains , even half-hidden by mists as they are . On one side , the road presses against a rocky outcropping ; rice fields crowd up on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fields are flooded ankle-deep at this time of year , and they smell of manure and young green things . Peasants poke the mud under the water with pointed sticks . Others cluster around the weir that blocks the river ; they seem to be removing some mysterious tangle of branch and vine that has clogged it . These are my fields . Every year rice has come to me from this place . It paid for our house in the capital , for the gifts to the ministers that were to fuel my political career , for my fans and papers and inks and robes , for my wife 's needs , for my horse . When I lived here , I did not even know what grew in these fields . I have not been back to this house in seven ? eight ? yearssince before Tadamaro was born . Shikujo and I moved here when we were and that I would visit her there . But she insisted we live together in a home of our own . Sometimes it surprises me that she did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything unconventional . The rest of the time she has been perfectly regular in her actions . Like her poems , her life has always been elegant but lacking spark . Still , she has a beauty I will never attain , bareheaded in the rain like a peasant . The rocks to our left fall away , are replaced by a fence of split bamboo . Even astride Kiku , I can not see over the small thatched roof that caps the fence , although I can see through the places where the fence has fallen away , into a garden as overgrown as a forest . Where the formal gate to the grounds should stand , there is instead a collapsed jumble of peeled boxwood logs . My major domo , Hito , shouts at the peasants who stand in the fields chattering , watching us with ( one presumes ) curiosity ( but who can tell what peasants think ? ) . A small man with a dun-colored face as crumpled as dirty hemp shuffles forward and bows . His bare feet and the hem of his short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the peasant : " How can you have let this place decay like this ? Look at this gate . What are we to do ?

The peasant 's voice rumbles beneath , anxious and placating . My horse shifts under me , as weary of traveling as I am . My thighs ache , and the joints of my hips , and my back . Everything . " Enough , " I say . I take Kiku through the humbled ( but still standing ) entrance that leads to the stable yard , leaving my servants to scramble after me . The packed-earth yard is clotted with clumps of last year 's leaves rotting into the puddled ground . Disturbed by something I can not see , a pair of jackdaws flies up , squawking , from the ragged thatch of the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be brushed smooth ; all the thatch needs to be retrimmed to a blunt edge . The yard smells musty , stale . There should be fires set in the buildings to drive the moisture from the dark corners and the vermin from the thatch ; but smoke curls from a single building 's open eaves . This must be where the servants charged with maintaining my estate live : it looks ( slightly ) better-kept than the rest . People swirl past me though the entranceshouts and chattering , the clattering of tools and wagons , the slapping of feet through water and mud . A groom catches my mare 's bridle as I slide gracelessly from her back . My back aches as I bend over to remove the leg-coverings that have protected my silks . I walk back the way I came , past my wife 's and my son 's carriages ; past the gold-colored ox we have brought with us for luck ; past the carts loaded with our chests and baskets and boxes ; past the chattering servants and through the stable yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields still watch . Under my eye they resettle their huge straw hats over their eyes and turn back to their fields . Nothing is left of the gate , just this pile of logs grown mossy on their north faces . The logs , the moss , the grasses aroundeverything shines with moisture that reflects the gray sky . The air of this place seems to watch me in a silence that the shouts from the stable yard only accentuate . I can not walk through the gate ; I can only step over it . Holding the folds of my hunting robes close , I step onto the nearest log . A burst of red-brown at my feet tips me back on my heels . By the time I 've caught my balance , the whatever-it-was has gone . Only the rustling of the tall grass settling back into place proves it ever existed . It seems that more than the air watched me . The fence enclosing the formal gardens is almost invisible in places , but whether it is covered with uncontrolled growth or missing altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the house , huddled tinder its dull tile roofs . Many of the walls of the wings are missing ; the covered walkways leading from wing to house look sound , but everywhere there are fallen tiles , moss , weeds springing from floors and roofs . This is my gate , my fence , my home : its disorder is my fault . My wife in her cramped dark carriage , my son 's impatient boredom , the loneliness of this uncivilized place , my inability or unwillingness to embrace the delicate life that would have given me a future in the capital . My fault . If I had known I would have to return , I would have tended things better . ( Continues ... )
