Sir Ivor Roberts , Britain 's Ambassador to Italy , declared last September that the " best recruiting sergeant for al-Qaeda " was none other than the U.S. President , George W. Bush . With the American election entering its final furlongs , he added , " If anyone is ready to celebrate the eventual re-election of Bush , it is al-Qaeda . " The remarks , made at an off-the-record conference , were leaked in the Italian press , and Sir Ivor , facing the displeasure of his Foreign Office masters for committing the sin of candor , disowned the comments . But now , as the soot settles in the London Underground , the words hang again in the air . <P> It is , of course , bad manners to point the finger at anyone but those responsible for the killings in London . They shed the blood ; they must answer for it . But as the trail of bodies that began with the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 continues to lengthen , we need to ask why the attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laden 's " achievements " in standing up to the American colossus on 9/11 have inspired others to follow his lead . Another is that American actions  --  above all , the invasion and occupation of Iraq  --  have galvanized still more Muslims and convinced them of the truth of bin Laden 's vision . <P> The conflict between radical Islam and the West , like all ideological struggles , is about competing stories . The audience is the global community of Muslims . America portrays itself as a benign and tolerant force that , with its Western partners , holds the keys to progress and prosperity . Radical Islamists declare that the universe is governed by a war between believers and World Infidelity , which comes as an intruder into the realm of Islam wearing various masks : secularism , Zionism , capitalism , globalization . World Infidelity , they argue , is determined to occupy Muslim lands , usurp Muslims ' wealth and destroy Islam . <P> Invading Iraq , however noble the U.S. believed its intentions , provided the best possible confirmation of the jihadist claims and spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause as their own . The evidence is available in the elaborate underground railroad that has brought hundreds of European Muslims to the fight in Iraq . And the notion that the West would enhance its security by occupying Iraq has proved utterly illusory . Coalition forces in Iraq face daily attacks from jihadists not because Saddam Hussein had trained a cadre of terrorists  --  we know there was no pre-existing relationship between Baghdad and al-Qaeda  --  but because the U.S. invasion brought the targets into the proximity of the killers . <P> Those who bombed the Madrid commuter lines last year were obsessed with Iraq . They delighted in the videotape that showed Iraqis rejoicing alongside the bodies of seven Spanish intelligence agents who were killed outside Baghdad in November 2003 ; they spoke of the need to punish Spain ( their adoptive country ) for supporting America ; they recruited others to fight in the insurgency . They began work on their plot the day after hearing an audiotaped bin Laden threaten " all the countries that participate in this unjust war in Iraq  --  especially Britain , Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been the first time Spain had been mentioned in an al-Qaeda hit list .
