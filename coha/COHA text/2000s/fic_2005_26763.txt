The Best-Kept Secret Chapter One The Reverend Curtis Black proofed the last line of his news column and e-mailed it to his editor . His deadline was noon tomorrow , and that meant he was cutting it rather close . Not purposely , of course , but primarily because he 'd taken on a large number of commitments over the past month . Last week , he 'd preached at a revival in Dallas five days straight , prepared his sermon for Sunday worship , and handled a ton of other pastoral responsibilities as soon as he returned to Mitchell , a city ninety miles northwest of Chicago . Once upon a time , he would have thrived on traveling long distance , just to escape his home environment or whatever wife he was married to , but to his surprise , he no longer felt that way . Now he wanted nothing more than to spend as much time as possible with his wife and seven-year-old son . Charlotte and Matthew were his life , and he was proud of the fact that he 'd been faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which was quite an accomplishment on his part , since he had n't been true to either of his first two wives . He 'd finally mastered the ability to resist temptation , and his world was better because of it . Still , he had to admit , it was n't always easy , not with two noticeably attractive women at the church constantly trying to come on to him . The forty-year-old was quiet and discreet with her advances , but the younger one was almost blatant . It did n't matter one way or the other , though , because Curtis basically ignored them . He 'd learned the hard way that sleeping with outside women just was n't worth it . He flipped the light switch of his newly renovated study , engaged the security system , and walked out to the well-lit parking lot . After sitting inside his Cadillac SUV , the same one he 'd driven for three years , he turned the ignition and drove away from the church . Life was a lot different , now that they were living in Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was no longer earning five thousand per week , residing in a six-thousandsquare- foot house , or preaching to a three-thousand-plus congregation , but based on Mitchell 's cost of living , he was n't doing badly , especially since he and Charlotte had founded Deliverance Outreach the first month of their relocation . They 'd started out with maybe fifty members during the first six months , increased to just over a hundred the first year , and now they were easily five hundred strong . Curtis had built a well-known ministry that drew people in , but it certainly had n't hurt when another local pastor had retired and some of those members had sought a new church home . It also had n't hurt when he approached the local newspaper about doing a weekly column . Before arriving in Mitchell , he 'd written a church business plan , and when he 'd realized he needed something that would get people stirred up and taking notice of him , he 'd decided to submit a column to the Mitchell Post . The features editor was clearly interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial , she asked Curtis to rethink some of his subject matter . He was n't happy about the request but decided to do whatever he needed to in order to get his work published . In the beginning , he 'd centered his column on polite topics such as the importance of going to church on Sunday , the reason families needed to pray together , what couples should do when their marriages were falling apart . But three months later , his editor left for vacation , and Curtis snatched his golden opportunity . His interim editor was much more liberal and quickly approved a piece that Curtis had written on atheism , its effect on society and how nonbelievers were going straight to hell . And as Curtis suspected , letters to the editor poured in at an unusual rate . Days later , the editor in chief called a meeting with Curtis and offered him more control over his topics , which ranged from teenage sex to gang violence to adultery , the latter being something Curtis knew a lot about . But once a month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was almost finished writing his first book , How to Have Almost Everything You Want . His editor in chief was also talking possible syndication for his column . When Curtis arrived home , Matthew rushed toward him with a piece of paper . " Dad , look what I have , " he said , beaming and hugging his father around his waist . Curtis took the sheet of paper from his son and playfully grabbed him in a headlock . " What 's this ? " " It 's a permission slip for the Milwaukee zoo ! " " Wow . So you 're going to the zoo , huh ? " " Yep . And my teacher said that they need something called chaperones , too . " " Really ? And what exactly is a chaperone ? " " I 'm not sure . But I think you could be one if you wanted , because she told us to ask our parents . " " Is that so ? Well , just so you know , a chaperone is an adult who escorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh . Well , I really want you to go , okay ? " Curtis smiled at his son with all the love any child could stand . " You know I would n't miss it for the world . " " Wait ' til I tell Jonathan and Elijah , " he announced . " We 're gon na have so much fun . " Matthew brushed past his mother and ran back upstairs . Charlotte smiled at her little boy , then strutted into the kitchen and over to Curtis . " Hi , baby , " she said . " Hey , beautiful . " Curtis pulled her into his arms and kissed her . " What was that all about ? " " Field trip . His class is going to the zoo , and I told him I 'd be a chaperone . " " That little booger . He never said one word to me about any trip . " " What can I say ? Maybe he prefers spending time with his father , " Curtis teased , still holding his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
