<p> It 's April 17 , and still you have n't turned in your tax forms . In fact , you have n't finished them . Perhaps  --  sigh  --  you have n't even started them . <p> Clearly a healthy dose of self-flagellation is in order . But what then ? <p> First of all , take heart . You may be a procrastinator , but you 're in good company : 25 to 30 percent of Americans turn in their tax forms on the last possible day . That 's not expected to change this year , even though filers have a two-day reprieve , since April 15 , the usual day for filing taxes , fell on a weekend . <p> If it is impossible to finish your paperwork on time , you need to get an extension using IRS Form 4868 . Like other tax forms , it must be postmarked or sent electronically by midnight tonight . <p> Along with hundreds of other IRS forms , 4868 can be printed out from the agency 's home page at www.irs.gov . Click on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alternatively , the IRS has an automatic fax number for the 150 most common forms and for answers to frequently asked questions . You must use a telephone attached to a fax machine ; follow the recorded instructions to have documents faxed to you . The number , ( 703 ) 368-9694 , is not toll-free . <p> Many last-minute filers owe the IRS money , since people expecting refunds tend to file earlier in the year . If you owe , do n't forget to include a check with your extension form . <p> Alternatively , you can pay via MasterCard , American Express or Discover for a fee by calling ( 888 ) 272-9829 , a commercial service . Visa does not participate in the program , which charges a small fee based on how much your tax bill is . <p> Many libraries , post offices , community centers , copy shops and IRS branch offices carry paper tax forms , although supplies may be running low by today . People without Internet access can log on at the library and print out forms from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms at San Francisco 's Montgomery Street BART and Muni station today from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m . The IRS branch at 55 Market St. in San Jose will be handing out forms curbside from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m . <p> Once your forms are ready to go , you still have to get them postmarked by midnight . Otherwise , you 'll be assessed a monthly penalty of 0.5 percent of your total tax bill until you pay up , even if you 're requesting an extension . <p> Several area post offices will be open late this evening . <p> As you do your tax return , try to get the math right : If you send a payment that is at least 10 percent less than the amount owed , you may be penalized . <p> People who have Internet access ( and even some who do n't ) have the option of filing their tax forms electronically . The IRS site includes a list of commercial software providers , which typically offer interactive instructions along with electronic forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , and then click Online Software Filing Companies for a list of links . <p> The IRS urges taxpayers to " e-file " to cut down on paperwork , lost documents and other problems . The main advantage to filers is that refunds typically take three weeks , compared with 10 weeks for paper filers . <p> About one-third of individual federal tax forms are expected to be e-filed this year , up from a quarter last year . <p> H &R; Block , Jackson Hewitt and Intuit are the most popular software services . Most charge a fee of at least $10 . Your neighborhood accountant may also agree to key in the data from your paper tax form and file it for you electronically , but expect a charge of up to $60 . <p> Low-income individuals can ask their local IRS office to file for them electronically if their forms are less than 12 pages long , said Larry Wright , a spokesman for the IRS in Oakland . <p> If you are e-filing from home , do n't wait until 11:58 p.m. to try to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " electronic return originator , " since the IRS is not set up to receive individual files . Send your e-filing as early as possible to avoid electronic logjams , Wright advised . <p> If you are e-filing for the first time , you will need to send a copy of Form 8453 via snail mail to the IRS ; this is your official signature , which the IRS keeps on file . In the following years , you can simply include a personal identification number that the IRS will assign you in lieu of a hard-copy signature . <p> And what about your employer 's W-2 or other official forms you typically send in the mail with your tax filing ? You do n't need to send them when you file electronically , but you do need to keep them in case you are audited . <p> If you have questions about filling out your forms , several resources are available today . <p> Answers to the most common questions  --  such as the address you should send your tax forms to  --  can be found at www.irs.gov or via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 140 questions can be found at ( 800 ) 829-4477 . You 'll need a touch-tone phone . <p> Live assistance is available via the IRS ' toll-free information line , ( 800 ) 829-1040 . However , it will be extremely difficult to get a live agent today on the phone . <p> IRS agents and volunteer accountants will be staffing local branch offices today from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m . You ca n't make an appointment in advance , though , so if you want help , expect to wait for a while . <p> Bay Area IRS offices are at 450 Golden Gate in San Francisco , 1301 Clay St. in Oakland , 185 Lennon St. in Walnut Creek , 55 S. Market St. in San Jose , 777 Sonoma Ave . in Santa Rosa and 1761 Broadway in Vallejo . <p> In addition to submitting federal tax returns , many Californians will file their state returns today . It 's not necessary to file an extension request if you ca n't file today . The state grants an automatic extension until October 16 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due today , along with form FTB 3519 . <p> The Franchise Tax Board Web site provides downloadable forms and information about e-filing and other topics at www.ftb.ca.gov . Refunds will be mailed to e-filers in seven to 10 working days . <p> EXTENDED HOURS AT BAY AREA POST OFFICES <p> Midnight is the deadline for mailing tax returns . Your tax forms must be postmarked today in order to avoid penalties . <p> In the East Bay only , postal employees will be on hand at BART stations to accept state and federal tax returns from 6 to 8 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. today . <p> The service will be provided at stations in Berkeley , Concord , Fremont , Hayward , Oakland , Civic Center , Pleasanton , Richmond , Union City and Walnut Creek . <p> For those taking their tax returns to a post office , a number of Bay Area post offices plan to stay open longer today , offering window service and later pickup of outside mail collection boxes .
