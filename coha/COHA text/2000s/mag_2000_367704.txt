Nature loves the rhythm of a meandering river , with the summertime droughts and spring floods that nurture wildlife and push a waterway down a new path . Commercial barges , however , demand constancy , in the form of a canal filled with enough water to keep their 9-ft. - deep hulls from running aground . So after the great 1927 flood , the Army Corps of Engineers began shackling the unruly current . The corps built levees along the river 's banks to hold in the water and turned its rapids and ever changing sandbars into a more civilized staircase of 29 locks and dams stretching nearly 700 miles from St. Paul , Minn. , to St. Louis , Mo . Now the upper Mississippi has become a chain of placid pools , each deep enough to allow barges calm passage before a lock lowers them toward New Orleans . <P> But today there is congestion on this part of the river . The locks are too small to handle its 1,200-ft. , 15-barge tows , and so they must be broken in half to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to keep moving all the time , " explains Captain Dennis Drury over the thrum of his boat 's diesel engine as he slowly pushes more than two acres of barges carrying 20,000 tons of corn into a narrow lock at Winfield , Mo . " But you can sit here for a day and a half waiting on your turn to lock . " So the corps wants to build seven new 1,200-ft. chambers  --  double the length of the current locks  --  at a cost of $1.2 billion . And with the 400,000 jobs its Mississippi dams and locks provide , with its $4 billion annual budget , with its history of helping build the Capitol and the Panama Canal , and with the 12,000 miles of channels it now controls across America , the corps , you would think , will get what the corps wants . Politicians have always made sure of that . <P> This time , though , a man named Don Sweeney got in the way . Sweeney , a civilian economist with the corps for 22 years , was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new locks . He found that they would not be needed until 2040 and that any slowdowns would simply force shippers to shift to railroads or trucks . Sweeney 's military bosses were not pleased , he alleges , and they booted him off the panel in 1998 . " They told me to get the answer they wanted , or I 'd be gone , " says Sweeney . Then they used corps-friendly numbers , he says , to show that the added efficiencies of the bigger locks would justify their cost . In February , Sweeney complained to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel , which investigates the charges of whistle-blowers . The agency , after examining the facts , agreed there was a " substantial likelihood " that corps officials illegally wasted funds , and it referred the case to Defense Secretary William Cohen for further investigation . ( The lock study has cost $54 million since 1993 . ) Corps headquarters has characterized Sweeney 's charges as " very troubling " and has pledged to root out any wrongdoing . In addition to the Pentagon , Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's allegations . Despite the probes , the corps hopes to justify the bigger locks by year 's end and seek money from Congress to build them .
