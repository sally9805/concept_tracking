The irony did not escape Luis Moreno . In the blackness before dawn on Feb. 29 , the U.S. official waited with Jean-Bertrand Aristide on the tarmac of the Port-au-Prince airport for the Haitian President 's getaway plane . Moreno recalled that he had escorted Aristide on his triumphant , U.S.-backed return to Haiti 10 years earlier . When Moreno expressed regret at the turn of events , he says , the soon-to-be exiled leader replied , " Sometimes life is like that . " <P> By the time Aristide 's plane touched down in the Central African Republic , however , he was not sounding philosophical . He accused the Americans of carrying out a " geopolitical kidnapping , " claiming he had been forced out by a U.S.-led " coup d'etat . " Members of the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus have called for an investigation , but Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed the allegations as " absurd . " <P> What 's clear is that Aristide 's exit was arranged in a hurry . According to the Americans who assisted him , he realized his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rebels moved on the capital . He called U.S. Ambassador James Foley to ask for help getting out . " You have n't thought where you 're going until now ? " Foley asked with exasperation , according to a senior State Department official . As diplomats scrambled to find him an asylum , Moreno , the second-in-command at the U.S. embassy , set out for Aristide 's home . <P> When Moreno reached the house at around 4 a.m. , Aristide answered the door , a few packed bags at his side . They shook hands . Then Moreno asked if he knew why he was there . " Of course , " Aristide answered . <P> After they arrived at the airport to await a U.S.-chartered plane , Moreno asked Aristide for a letter of resignation as proof of a voluntary transfer of power . As his American-born wife Mildred sat in sullen silence , Aristide pulled the letter from her purse . In a single paragraph written in Creole , Aristide renounced his office : " The Constitution should not drown in the blood of the Haitian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be life and not death . " The Boeing 757 finally arrived , and at 6:15 a.m. on Feb. 29 , Aristide fled the country . " It was , " Moreno recalls , " a dignified exit . " <P> Not as Aristide recalls it . According to one of his advisers , U.S. officials leaned hard on the President in the hours before he left . Moreno told Aristide the U.S. could not stop rebels from killing him , says the adviser . The only escape was to leave under U.S. guard  --  at once . Escorted by armed U.S. soldiers into the plane , the President and his wife were forbidden to use the phone or peek out the window . <P> Aristide says he did not know his destination until he landed . In fact , the pilots did not know until the plane was over the Atlantic , when France secured the African country 's pledge . By then , Aristide 's fate was sealed .  --  By Lisa Takeuchi Cullen .
