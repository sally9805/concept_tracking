The Rev. John Ohmer knew the parents in his congregation wanted help weaning themselves from the habit of overindulging their children . But as a father of three who has to ration Nintendo in his own home , Ohmer , rector of St. James Episcopal Church in Leesburg , Va. , also knew it was n't as simple as just telling families to buy less . So he revved up what he calls an " underground Christian resistance movement " for parents , offering parish workshops that urged them to make an inventory of their lives and holidays and then imagine the ideal version . Their dreams , it turned out , entailed a lot less Visa debt and a lot more intangible stuff . What they needed to do , he advised , was " build a bridge between the two . " <P> That effort has become a bigger parish hit than bingo . St. James parents like James and Colleen Wheaton now set limits on the number and prices of Christmas gifts for their kids , whether from relatives or from Santa . They use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own family decorations  --  together . Ohmer 's workshop , says Colleen , " was the first place we could finally legitimize our frustrations . " <P> Across the country , groups with Ohmer 's spirit are leading a middle-class exodus out of the 90210 lifestyle . For example , more than 100 U.S. cities today host " simplicity circles " affiliated with the Cornell University-created Seeds of Simplicity program based in Los Angeles . Then there is the Center for a New American Dream , a Takoma Park , Md. , group whose motto is " More fun , less stuff ! " Says director Betsy Taylor : " This is n't just about unspoiling kids . It 's about reclaiming our kids from a toxic commercial culture that has spun out of control . " <P> At St. James last month , parishioner Mary Pellicano talked about the excesses of a " Dragontails " birthday party she and her husband George recently gave for their son Kieran , 4 . " All the paraphernalia , the goody bags  --  it was over the top , " Mary recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as happy playing hide-and-seek with a few friends before the cake . I realized I was n't doing this for him  --  I was doing it for me ! It was just another way of trying to keep up with the new SUV next door . " <P> The night before , a simplicity circle in Silver Spring , Md. , brainstormed solutions to the birthday angst . Jennifer Shields , a mother of children ages 3 and 4 , said she explicitly asks on party invitations that guests give only art supplies  --  and she keeps her kids ' gift expectations low by making her home TV-free during the day . Shields got applause  --  but also sparked debate . " We have to raise our kids to confront commercial realities , " said Len Ingber . " We 're not Amish . " <P> There was consensus , however , over the Seeds of Simplicity proposal to resurrect household chores . " My kids have friends who have never had to help empty a dishwasher , " said Erin Fulham . " Once a week now , my 11-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Seeds of Simplicity 's other core recommendations include making only planned trips to the mall  --  so kids view shopping as a more scheduled , less impulsive exercise  --  and consulting kids about any simplification decisions . Otherwise , says Seeds director Carol Holst , " you 'll just have more screaming tantrums in the Toys ' R ' Us cash-register line . "
