Those names floated on the frosty breath of everyone in Wisconsin in the 1980s , swam in the water that turned each winter to ice : Heiden and Blair and Jansen . Chris Witty and Casey FitzRandolph , born just four months and 75 miles apart , were n't like the kids elsewhere who only heard of speed skating 's Olympic giants every four years . No , Witty grew up a mile from Dan Jansen 's home in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis , and FitzRandolph grew up skating on the same Madison rinks on which Eric Heiden sharpened his blades . Witty and FitzRandolph grew up knowing that Milwaukee and skating were synonymous with greatness . // Those names floated back into the 2002 Winter Olympics last week . There , on Sunday evening , was Bonnie Blair , now a member of the U.S. speed skating board of directors , swinging a cowbell in the stands of the Utah Olympic Oval and shouting " Way cool ! " when she realized that Witty had somehow shrugged off mononucleosis and was on her way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-record time of 1:13.83 . There , five days earlier , was Heiden , now the physician for the U.S. speed-skating team , congratulating FitzRandolph after he became the first American since Heiden in 1980 to win the 500-meter gold . There , too , was Jansen , the most self-effacing TV commentator at the Games , prowling an Olympic hallway , and as the 26-year-old Witty made her restrained victory lap and the 27-year-old FitzRandolph marveled over how " so not worthy " he was to win , it was easy to take it in and see the sport as it always had been . // Indeed , though seven Americans , the most ever , won medals in the sport in the game 's first nine days ( with 18 overall medals through Sunday , the U.S. eclipsed its Winter record of 13 ) , U.S. speed skating could 've picked no one better than Witty as its headliner . During her formative years as a skater , her father , Walter , could n't find a steady job for eight years after being laid off at a tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of her mom , Diane , who worked in an insurance company 's claims department until she , too , was laid off . Somehow Chris worked enough paper routes and odd jobs to pay for her skating . She won the only two U.S. speed skating medals  --  a silver and a bronze  --  in Nagano in 1998 , but most of last year Witty had been afflicted by a lethargy she could n't explain and had n't won a race since last March . In the moments before coach Tom Cushman told her last month her ailment had been diagnosed as mononucleosis , Witty was certain he would tell her she was going to die . // Relieved that her exhaustion was treatable but knowing she had only weeks to train , Witty figured she had no hope of surpassing her performance in Nagano . She thought she might grab one bronze medal . Witty , though , gained strength over the last fortnight , and after finishing 14th in the 500 last Thursday , she entered her pairing with Canadian superstar Catriona LeMay Doan in Sunday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken the world record racing against LeMay Doan . If she could stay with the two-time 500-meter gold medalist through the first half of the race , Witty figured , she 'd have a shot at winning . Instead , she blew LeMay Doan and everyone else off the ice . // " I could n't believe it , " Witty said . " It 's the most shocking result of my life . It 's something you dream about as a kid : home country , world-record time , the gold medal . That 's how I dreamed about it when I was nine . " // However , as Witty knows , these Olympics mark what she calls " the end of an era . " She and FitzRandolph are the last of a distinguished line , the generation of long-track skaters who grew up before clapskates revolutionized the sport , the last generation whose parents knew one another and frequented the same frozen ponds and thought of Milwaukee as their Mecca . Former in-line or roller skaters such as Mexican-American Derek Parra , a shocking silver medalist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took the bronze in the women 's 1,000 on Sunday , have made balmy climes like Southern California and Miami as important to speed skating , and both the success of the U.S. team 's altitude training in Utah and the astonishing speed of the Olympic oval  --  on which four world , and countless personal and national , records were shattered last week  --  have made Milwaukee 's hegemony a thing of the past . // " Milwaukee will never be the center of speed skating in the United States again , " says Jeff FitzRandolph , Casey 's dad and a member of U.S. speed skating 's board of directors . " There 's just not the same philosophy toward speed skating in Milwaukee that there is in Salt Lake City now . They 're not willing to put the money into it ; they do n't have the resources . Everything will move out here . " // Says U.S. national coach Bart Schouten , " The national team will have to be here . This is the place to be . " // Despite their success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise bronzes in the 500 and the 1,000 meters , respectively  --  the long-track skaters spent each day of this Olympics knowing that the public 's attention was turning elsewhere . Suddenly , with 19-year-old Apolo Ohno in position to win perhaps four gold medals , short-track speed skating had become what U.S. coach Susan Ellis called " the hottest ticket in town . " The short-track skaters easily sold out the Salt Lake Ice Center , with crowds of 16,500 drawn by the prospect of high speed , tight corners and bodies spinning out of control . If speed skating is a family , long-track is the straight-arrow brother , long respected by the community . Short-track , an Olympic sport for only 10 years , is the unruly brother who comes home tattooed and bloodied , and sleeps until noon . But he woke up in Salt Lake City last week , and he was a star . // Never mind that inside the sport , the race-fixing charges that had erupted at December 's short-track Olympic trials in Salt Lake City still lingered . Both Ohno and teammate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they conspired to fix the 1,000-meter finals to get Ohno 's friend , Shani Davis , on the Olympic squad , but that official finding did nothing to shake the near-universal conviction among those in the skating community who had seen the race that something suspicious had happened . Yet the controversy only seemed to give short-track more of a buzz , and a public that knows little about speed skating and less about short-track came to Salt Lake City ready to be wowed . " People already think these are Apolo 's Olympics , " Casey FitzRandolph said last Saturday . // Ohno came into last Saturday 's 1,000-meter race looking to win the first of those four gold medals , and he breezed around rivals and through qualifying rounds with the certainty of a champion . " He looks fabulous , " Ellis said after the first round . " He 's sitting there with both hands on his back , a little grin on his face , saying , I know where I 'm at . " Saturday night 's final was no different : Ohno yawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of the nine laps around the 111-meter oval , he dictated the pace while zipping around opponents at will . " The best race of my life , " Ohno said after . " I could feel the win . " // Then in the final turn , only 20 meters from the finish line , Ohno and archrival Li Jiajun of China tangled arms . Li , last year 's world champion in the 1,000 , spun out of the race , but just as Ohno seemed to recover his footing , he was sent sprawling into the boards along with Canada 's Mathieu Turcotte by a slip-sliding , bespectacled , 16-year-old Korean named Ahn Hyun-Soo . Forget roller derby : This looked like a four-car pileup at Daytona . Ohno crawled his way across the finish line , followed by Turcotte 's frantically executed baseball slide . It was too late : Amid loud booing Steven Bradbury , a 28-year-old Australian competing in his fourth Olympics , who had been in last place , so far behind that the crash had n't affected him , had swooped past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ice , " Bradbury said , " and I was like , ' Hang on . This ca n't be right . I think I won ! ' " // The crowd could n't believe it either . As he skated a victory lap , Bradbury exchanged curses and vulgar sign language with a fan who screamed that he did n't deserve the gold . Then again , no one knew what he 'd been through . The fact that he 'd been handed instant immortality as Australia 's first Winter Olympic gold medalist was the least remarkable thing about Bradbury . In fact , no one in the sport better embodies the danger , unpredictability and lunacy of short-track . While training in October 2000 , Bradbury flew headfirst into a barrier , breaking his neck . On his forehead , somewhere between his gravity-defying dyed-blond hair and the tiny barbell in his pierced eyebrow , Bradbury can trace the scars of the halo-brace that was screwed into his skull . " It wrecked my 2000-01 season , " he says . // For anyone feeling sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1994 he led the last lap of a 1,500-meter race at a World Cup event in Montreal when someone tried to pass him . Three skaters went down , Bradbury somersaulted in the air and , when he landed , impaled his leg on a skate . He lost four of the six liters of blood in his body and needed 111 stitches . " I was lucky to survive , " Bradbury says . // Bradbury 's survival skills had one final test last Saturday . Knowing he could n't outrace anyone , Bradbury had a simple strategy for the quarterfinals , semis and finals : Stay back and hope that chaos ensues . In his quarterfinal heat two racers crashed and Bradbury advanced ; in his semi Turcotte and Li crashed , and the apparent winner , Japan 's Satoru Terao , was disqualified for impeding ; Bradbury moved on to the final . " Those were my tactics , " Bradbury says , " and they worked like a charm . " When he took the medal stand , Ohno was the first to shake Bradbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut on his inner left thigh that required six stitches , but in a bizarre Olympic twist , he did n't demand a rerace , file a protest or call for a duplicate gold medal . Ohno was gracious , saying he was " really happy " for Bradbury , and he uttered the universal mantra of everyone in the sport : " That is short-track . This is the sport I live for . " // Thus was revealed one of the sport 's hidden virtues : There 's no heartbreak . A quest for four gold medals is nearly impossible because the smallest factor  --  a dull skate blade , a patch of soft ice , the whirling arm of a competitor  --  can send you flying . Even when the slowest man wins , even when a gold medal dream goes up the chimney , the only thing to do is shrug , say , " That 's short-track " and skate on . // The sport 's older brother does n't have that luxury . A long-track skater 's race is against the clock , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His best friend is Canada 's Jeremy Wotherspoon , the former world-record holder in the 500 and 1,000 , and the man who came to Salt Lake City with every expectation of winning at least one gold . In 1999 , dissatisfied with his training , FitzRandolph took the revolutionary step of moving to Canada and working with its top skaters . Led by Wotherspoon , the Canadians welcomed FitzRandolph like a brother , gave his fianc ? e , Jennifer Bocher , a job , shared with him everything they knew . Wotherspoon changed the way FitzRandolph looked at himself , made him understand that excellence was about pushing beyond one 's limits , not beating the next guy . In July , Wotherspoon will stand as a groomsman at FitzRandolph 's wedding . // " It 's so tough , " FitzRandolph says , and his eyes fill with tears . " It takes such a big person to do what he did for me. " // What 's so tough  --  no , heartbreaking  --  is that on the first day of the 500-meter final , Wotherspoon took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell . Wotherspoon did n't finish that race and wound up 13th in the 1,000 , and FitzRandolph is still unsure how to handle that . He tried once , right after Wotherspoon fell . FitzRandolph found his friend in the locker room , hunched over and silent on a bench . // FitzRandolph sat down , put his arm around Wotherspoon 's shoulders , croaked out one word , and then two men , neither of whom had seen the other cry before , wept , side by side and shaking , for a very long time . That 's not just long-track . That 's life .
