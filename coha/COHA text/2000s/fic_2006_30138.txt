Shadow Man By Cody Mcfadyen Random House Cody Mcfadyen I HAVE ONE of the dreams . There are only three ; two are beautiful , one is violent , but all of them leave me shivering and alone . The one I have tonight is about my husband . It goes something like this : I could say he kissed my neck , and leave it like that , simplicity . But that would be a lie , in the most basic way that the word was created to mean . It would be more truthful to say that I yearned for him to kiss my neck , with every molecule of my being , with every last , burning inch of me , and that when he did , his lips were the lips of an angel , sent from heaven to answer my fevered prayers . I was seventeen then , and so was he . It was a time when there was no blandness or darkness . There was only passion , sharp edges , and a light that burned so hard it hurt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie theater and ( Oh God ) he hesitated for just a moment and ( Oh God ) I quivered on a precipice but pretended to be calm , and Oh God Oh God Oh God he kissed my neck , and it was heaven , and I knew right then and there that I would be with him forever . He was my one . Most people , I know , never find their one . They read about it , dream about it , or scoff at the idea . But I found mine , I found him when I was seventeen , and I never let him go , not even the day he lay dying in my arms , not even when death ripped himfrom me as I screamed , not even now . God 's name these days means suffering : Oh God Oh God Oh God-I miss him so . I wake with the ghost of that kiss on my flushed seventeen-year-old skin , and realize that I am not seventeen , and that he has stopped aging at all . Death has preserved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is always seventeen years old , always leaning forward , always brushing my neck in that perfect moment . I reach over to the spot he should be sleeping in , and I am pierced with a pain so sudden and blinding that I pray as I shiver , pray for death and an end to pain . But of course , I go on breathing , and soon , the pain lessens . I miss everything about him being in my life . Not just the good things . I miss his flaws as achingly as I miss the beautiful parts of him . I miss his impatience , his anger . I miss the patronizing look he would give me sometimes when I was mad at him . I miss being annoyed by the fact he 'd always forget to fill the gas tank , leaving it near empty when I was ready to go somewhere . This is the thing , I think often , that never occurs to you when you consider what it would be like to lose someone you love . That you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the totality of the experience . You miss the failures and little evils with as much desperation as you miss being held in the middle of the night . I wish he were here now , and I was kissing him . I wish he were here now , and I was betraying him . Either would be fine , so fine , as long as he was here . People ask sometimes , when they get up the courage , what it 's like to lose someone you love . I tell them it 's hard , and leave it at that . I could tell them that it 's a crucifixion of the heart . I could say that most days after , I screamed without stopping , even as I moved through the city , even with my mouth closed , even though I did n't make a sound . I could tell them I have this dream , every night , and lose him again , every morning . But , hey , why ruin their day ? So I tell them it 's hard . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dreams , and it gets me out of bed , shaking . I stare at the empty room , and then turn to the mirror . I have learned to hate mirrors . Some would say that this is normal . That all of us do this , put ourselves under the microscope of self-reflection and focus on the flaws . Beautiful women create fret and worry lines by looking for those very things . Teenage girls with beautiful eyes and figures to die for weep because their hair is the wrong color , or they think their nose is too big . The price of judging ourselves through others ' eyes , one of the curses of the human race . And I agree . But most people do n't see what I see when I look into the mirror . When I look at myself , what I see is this : I have a jagged scar , approximately one half inch wide , that begins in the middle of my forehead at my hairline . It shoots straight down , then turns at a near perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left eyebrow ; the scar has taken its place . It crosses my temple , where it then makes a lazy loop-de-loop down my cheek . It rips over toward my nose , crosses the bridge of it just barely , and then turns back , slicing in a diagonal across my left nostril and zooming one final time past my jawline , down my neck , ending at my collarbone . It 's quite an effect . If you look at me in right profile only , everything looks normal . You have to stare at me straight on to get the full picture . Everyone looks in a mirror at least once a day , or sees their reflection in the eyes of others . And they know what to expect . They know what they will see , what will be seen . I no longer see what I expect to see . I have the reflection of a stranger , staring out of a mask I ca n't take off . When I stand naked in front of the mirror , as I am now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only be called a necklace of cigar-sized circular scars , going from under one side of my collarbone to the next . More of the same traverse my breasts , go down across my sternum and stomach , ending just above my pubic hair . The scars are cigar-sized because a cigar is what made them . If you can put all of that aside , things look pretty good . I 'm small , four foot ten inches tall . I 'm not skinny , but I am in shape . My husband used to call it a " lush " figure . After my mind , heart , and soul , he used to say , he married me for my " mouth-sized boobs and my heart-shaped ass . " I have long , thick , dark , curly hair that hangs down to just above said ass . He used to love that too . It is hard for me to look past those scars . I 've seen them a hundred times , maybe a thousand . They are still all I see when I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who killed my husband and my daughter . Who was later killed by me . I feel a broad emptiness rush into me thinking about this . It 's huge , dark , and absolutely nerveless . Like sinking into numb Jell-o . No big deal . I 'm used to it . That 's just how my life is now . I sleep for no more than ten minutes , and I know that I wo n't be sleeping again tonight . I remember waking up a few months ago in the middle hours , just like this . That time between 3:30 and 6:00 a.m. , when you feel like the only person on earth if you happen to be up then . I 'd had one of the dreams , as always , and knew I was n't going to be getting back to sleep . I pulled on a T-shirt and some sweatpants , slipped on my battered sneakers , and headed out the door . I ran and ran and ran in the night , ran till my body was slick with sweat , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I ran some more . I was n't pacing myself , and my breath was coming out fast . My lungs felt scarred by the coolness of that early-morning air . I did n't stop , though . I ran faster , legs and elbows pumping , running as fast as I could , reckless . I ended up in front of one of those convenience stores that fill the Valley , over by the curb , gagging and hacking up stomach acid . A couple of other early-morning ghosts looked over at me , then looked away . I stood up , wiped my mouth , and slammed through the front door of the store . " I want a pack of cigarettes , " I said to the proprietor , still gulping in air . He was an older man , in his fifties , who looked Indian to me . " What kind do you want ? " The question startled me . I had n't smoked in years . I looked at the rows behind him , my eyes catching the once-beloved Marlboros . " Marlboros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang it up . Which is when I realized I was in sweats and had no money . Instead of being embarrassed , I was , of course , angry . " I forgot my purse . " I said it with my chin jutted out , defiant . Daring him to not give me the cigarettes or to make me feel ridiculous in any way . He looked at me for a moment . It was , I guess , what writers would call a " pregnant pause . " He relaxed . " You 've been running ? " he asked . " Yeah-running from my dead husband . Better than killing yourself , I guess , ha ha ! " The words came out sounding funny to my ears . A little loud , a little strangled . I suppose I was a little crazy . But instead of getting the flinch or look of discomfort I so wanted from him at that moment , his eyes went soft . Not with pity , but with understanding . He nodded . He reached across the counter , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My wife die in India . One week before we were supposed to come to America . You take the cigarettes , pay me next time . " I stood there for a moment , staring at him . And then I snatched those cigarettes and ran out of there as fast as I could , before the tears started rolling down my cheeks . I clutched that pack of cigarettes and ran home weeping . The place is a little out of my way , but I never go anywhere else now when I want to smoke . I sit up now and smile a little as I find the pack of cigarettes on the nightstand , and think of the guy at the store as I light up . I guess a part of me loves that little man , in the way you can only love a stranger who shows you a kindness so perfect at a time when you need it the most . It 's a deep love , a pang in the heart , and I know that even if I never know his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . I inhale , a nice deep lungful , and regard the cigarette , its perfect cherry tip as it glows in the dark of my bedroom . This , I think , is the insidiousness of the cursed things . Not the nicotine addiction , though that 's surely bad enough . But the way a cigarette just fits in certain places . Morning dawns with a steaming cup of coffee . Or lonely nights in a house filled with ghosts . I know I should give them up again , before they get their claws all the way back into me , but I also know I wo n't . They are all I have right now , a reminder of a kindness , a comfort and a source of strength , all rolled into one . I exhale and watch the smoke billow , caught here and there by little currents of air , floating and then disappearing . Like life , I think . Life is smoke , plain and simple ; we just fool ourselves that it 's otherwise . All it takes is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind only the scent of our passing in the form of memories . I cough suddenly , laughing at all the connections . I 'm smoking , life is smoke , and my name is Smoky . Smoky Barrett . My real name , given to me because my mother thought it " sounded cool . " This makes me cackle in the dark , in my empty house , and I think as I laugh ( as I have before ) just how crazy laughter sounds when you 're laughing alone . This gives me something to think about for the next three or four hours . Being crazy , I mean . Tomorrow is the day , after all . The day when I decide if I go back to work for the FBI or come home , put a gun in my mouth , and blow my brains out .
