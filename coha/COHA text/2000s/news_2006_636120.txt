<p> ASK THE FOOL <p> How can I stop getting all these credit card offers in the mail ? <p>  --  F.C. , Toledo , Ohio <p> As part of the Fair Credit Reporting Act , credit reporting agencies are required to maintain an opt-out list of consumers who do n't want to receive pre-approved ( or pre-screened ) offers . The four largest reporting agencies  --  Equifax , Experian , TransUnion and Innovis  --  manage the list . <p> You can add yourself to it at www.optoutprescreen.com or by calling 1-888-OPT-OUT .

You 'll have to provide your name , address , Social Security number and date of birth , because each credit report is tagged by your Social Security number , not your name . If you move , you should opt out again , to register your new address . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p>  --  G.B. , Greenville , N.C. <p> According to recent estimates , the Medicare trust fund is expected to run out of money by 2018 .

We ca n't <p> provide individual financial advice . <p> FOOL 'S SCHOOL <p> WISDOM FROM OMAHA <p> Here are some paraphrased words of wisdom from superinvestors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger from the recent Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting : <p> On companies trying to produce smooth results : It 's bad when headquarters says that earnings must go up regularly . In business , earnings do n't always go up regularly . You do n't want to set up a system that exerts pressure on employees to do things that they know they should n't do . <p> On the declining dollar : It 's tough for individuals to invest in foreign currencies . Anything you do to develop your own abilities and your business will be more productive than worrying about foreign exchange rates . <p> On the market 's direction : If the market gets cheaper , we 'll be buying as prices drop . I 'm Buffett always looking to buy stocks , just as I buy groceries every week , and I prefer lower prices for both . We spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't know which way it 's headed . We do know that sometimes we 'll get great value for our money . <p> On Social Security : Anything that reduces Social Security payments below their current levels is a mistake . We could raise the payroll tax cap from $90,000 . I Buffett do n't understand why the administration worries about the size of the deficit in 25 years when it does n't seem to care much about the size of the deficit now . If the system is n't changed , the percentage of gross domestic product devoted to Social Security will rise from 4.5 now to 6 . That does n't seem so bad . Social Security is a very successful program with hardly any fraud . All this talk to change it is twaddle . <p> Advice for investors : If you have the choice of owning bonds yielding 4.5 percent or owning stocks for the next 20 years , you should own stocks . But if you think you can earn double-digit annual returns in stocks , you are kidding yourselves . The stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 percent . <p> For more , read Buffett 's letters to shareholders at <p> **25;2127;TOOLONG and Roger Lowenstein 's book , Buffett : The Making of an American Capitalist ( Main Street Books , $19 ) . <p> THE MOTLEY FOOL TAKE <p> MAKE SPACE FOR NEWS CORP . <p> News Corp .
