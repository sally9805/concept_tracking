VOLUNTEER WITH LIBRARY SKILLS EXCHANGE <p> If you love books and reading , consider spending the summer of 2004 helping communities gain access to the information they need to build a better future . School librarians are especially welcomed as participants in this program . <p> The Inform the World Library Skills Exchange is a four-week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retired professionals . ( Non-librarians may apply . ) The program provides structured training and assistance to South African librarians and others with little or no formal librarian training , while offering volunteers the opportunity to use their skills and experience the vibrant culture of rural South African communities . <p> The program is called a " skills exchange " because African and international librarians bring their expertise together to create unique answers to the information needs of rural African communities . Sometimes the solutions are based on international standards , like using a recognized method for classifying books . Other times , they are unique adaptations to local conditions , like delivering books by donkey cart or making paper from elephant dung . Most often , each volunteer and African librarian contributes to creating a library as special as the community it serves . <p> Two exchange groups are planned for 2004 : one group is going to Limpopo province July 12-Aug. 12 , and another to KwaZulu Natal ( KZN ) province July 16-Aug. 17 . <p> Applications from interested volunteers around the world are invited .

School in Jericho , VT , and is reprinted with permission . Ken Remsen is also the guest columnist for this issue 's Administrator 's Perspective column , " Using the Library to Improve Student Literacy . " <p> Get in Line for No Cow Left Behind <p> As a principal facing the task of figuring out all the complexities of the No Child Left Behind legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a strong belief that testing students is the answer to bringing about improvements in student performance . <p> Since testing seems to be a cornerstone to improving performance , I do n't understand why this principle is n't applied to other businesses that are not performing up to expectations . I was thinking about the problem of falling milk prices and wondering why testing cows would n't be effective in bringing up prices since testing students is going to bring up test scores . <p> The federal government should mandate testing all cows every year starting at age 2 . Now , I know that it will take time out of the farmers ' necessary work to do this testing every year and that it may be necessary to spend inordinate amounts of money on the testing equipment , but that should not detract us from what must be done . <p> I 'm sure there are plenty of statistics to show what good milk-producing performance looks like and the characteristics of cows who achieve this level of performance . It should , therefore , be easy to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will begin our testing by finding out which cows now meet the standard , which almost meet the standard , which meet the standard with honors and which show little evidence of achievement . <p> Points will be assigned in each category and it will be necessary to achieve a certain average score . If this score is not achieved , the Department of Agriculture will send in experts to give advice for improvement . If improvements do not occur over a couple of years , the state will take over your farm or even force you to sell . <p> Now , I 'm sure farms have a mix of cows in the barn but it is important to remember that every cow can meet the standard . There should be no exceptions and no excuses . I do n't want to hear about the cows that just came to the barn from the farm down the road that did n't provide the proper nutrition or a proper living environment . <p> All cows need to meet the standard . <p> Another key factor will be the placement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you have been farming for many years but it will be necessary for all farmers to become certified . This will mean some more paperwork and testing on your knowledge of cows , but in the end this will lead to the benefit of all . <p> It will also be necessary to allow barn choice for the cows . If cows are not meeting the standard in certain farms , they will be allowed to go to the barn of their choice . Transportation might become an issue but it is critical that cows be allowed to leave their low-performing barns . This will force low-performing farms to meet the standard or else they will simply go out of business . <p> Some small farms will probably go out of business as a result of this new legislation . Simply put , the cost per cow is too high . As taxpayers , we can not be expected to foot the bill to subsidize farms with dairy compacts . <p> Even though no one really knows what the ideal cost is to keep cows content , the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above this cost will be penalized . Since everyone knows that there are economies of scale , small farms will probably be forced to close and those cows will merge into larger farms . <p> Some farmers may be upset that I proclaim to know what is best for these cows but I certainly consider myself capable of making these recommendations . ! grew up next to a farm and I drink milk . I hope you will consider this advice in the spirit it is given and I hope you will agree that the No Cow Left Behind legislation may not be best for a small state like Vermont . <p>
