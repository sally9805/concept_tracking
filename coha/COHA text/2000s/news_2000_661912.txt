<p> Scientist Kwok Chan switches on a cell phone held against a model of the human head and gently lowers a radiation probe into the honey-colored goopy liquid simulating the blood and brain tissue inside a person 's skull . <p> Chan 's computers in this Federal Communications Commission laboratory then measure how much radiation Americans absorb when they talk on their cell phones . <p> Now , amid the Christmas sales rush , manufacturers are revealing for the first time the radiation levels of nearly every phone sold to consumers so infatuated with the gadgets they use them when they walk , drive , even eat . <p> It is a disclosure that could alert many of the nation 's 97 million cell phone users to an issue they largely have ignored : conflicting evidence about whether the devices , which unlike regular phones work by beaming radiofrequency energy through the air , pose any health threats . <p> But will the radiation disclosures suggest one cell phone brand is safer than another ? Or that people who spend hours pressing them against their ear are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother to read the levels ? <p> " People are going to look at that information and say ' huh ? " ' said Dave Berndt , a financial analyst at Boston 's Yankee Group who specializes in wireless technologies . <p> Federal health officials insist , and published medical studies agree , that so far , there is no real evidence cell phones cause brain tumors or other health hazards - beyond causing car crashes when people gab while driving . <p> At the same time , no government or health organization yet gives cell phones a definitively clean bill of health . <p> In fact : <p> - The Food and Drug Administration just ordered new studies after industry-sponsored test-tube research discovered cell phone signals might cause genetic damage in human blood cells , which in turn might spur cancer growth . <p> - British health officials last week began distributing leaflets warning that children should limit cell-phone use to emergencies , because children 's still-forming skulls and brains could be more vulnerable if the phones ultimately prove risky . The leaflets also disclose each phone model 's radiation level and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small studies raise health questions , including one controversial finding that tumors were more likely near the ear where patients held their cell phone . But it has been attacked as scientifically flawed . <p> The conflicting opinions have prompted at least one wireless company to post store signs recommending that parents consider pagers instead of cell phones for children . Metrocall , a nationwide reseller of wireless service , also recommends using earphones instead of holding cell phones to the head . <p> While taking no position on the science , " We decided if we were going to err , we wanted to err on the side of the angels , " said Mike Scanlon , senior vice president at the Alexandria , Va. - based company . <p> Many phone manufacturers fear that listing the radiation number will prompt consumers to buy only the lowest-emitting phones even though every phone must meet federal radiation safety limits . <p> Consequently , manufacturers will not make it easy to compare levels before buying . The numbers will not appear on the outside of cell phone packages , only inside along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone before buying , consumers must look it up on the Internet . <p> " Unless these numbers are explained and put into the proper context , they will be regarded as gradients of safety , which they are not , " contends Norm Sandler of Motorola , a leading cell phone equipment maker . <p> Amid this confusion , a new cottage industry is marketing products claiming to limit radiation absorption . They range from foam wafers stuck onto the phone 's earpiece to an antenna-attached gadget that looks like a ceramic ladybug . <p> Experts warn against the hype . <p> " For a device which actually claims to reduce radiation , they should look for the data that it in fact does that . But still be aware of the fact that they 're taking a precaution that may not be necessary , " says Dr. David Feigal , chief of the FDA branch overseeing cell phone safety . <p> If precautions are not necessary , why did the FDA just call for more safety studies ? <p> " We 're not encouraging research because we know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure there 's not a problem , " said Feigal , who uses a cell phone himself . <p> Reassuringly , newer digital phones already emit less radiation then older analog models . Still , one expert on radiofrequency energy says choosing lower-emitting phones makes sense for now . <p> " I think people need to make decisions with respect to their own sense of comfort given the uncertainty right now as to whether cell phones are safe or not , " said Dr. Patrick Breysse of Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , who keeps a phone in his car only for emergencies . <p> Radiofrequency waves are non-ionizing radiation , far less worrisome than other types of radiation types such as what suntanners absorb . On an energy-frequency scale , cell phone RF waves fall somewhere between microwave ovens and television signals . <p> But any radiation-emitting device used by millions raises health questions that can take years to settle . <p> " One of the biggest concerns we have ... is that some of the same ( energy ) frequencies in cell phones have been used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FCC lab where Chan studies radiation absorption . <p> Microwaves damage tissue by burning it . Cell phones ' lower-powered RF waves are not thought to cause enough heat to hurt . Frequent callers who feel heat are actually feeling the phone 's battery . The question is whether low-energy RF waves can cause any significant non-thermal biological effects . <p> How much RF energy is absorbed by a caller 's head is a measurement known as the " standard absorption rate " or SAR . The FCC limits the SAR to no higher than a level of 1.6 - the energy , measured in watts per kilogram , that one gram of tissue absorbs from a cell phone . <p> Companies say if they comply with that standard , their phones are safe . But , yielding to increasing public concern , major wireless companies plan to disclose each a phone 's SAR with models now beginning to hit store shelves . <p> Phone packages will bear an ID number enabling consumers to look up radiation absorption levels on the FCC 's Web site before buying . Or after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an explanation of what it means inside the package . <p> The effort is meant to reassure consumers " that these phones must meet strict federal guidelines , " said Jo-Anne R. Basile of the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association , the leading trade group . <p> But to industry 's chagrin , some Web sites - including www.domode.com - have begun ranking certain phones ' radiation levels . " Looking at raw numbers can be misleading , " Basile complains . <p> To determine SARs , cell phones undergo rigorous testing using equipment like Chan 's in the FCC 's concrete-block laboratory in this Washington suburb . <p> A large hollow model of the head holds a solution , made mostly of water and sugar , that mimics the electrical properties of brain and other tissue . Chan dips a large robotic arm carrying a radiation probe into the model while another robotic arm holds a phone at the model 's " ear . " The probe records the spot inside the head where the highest RF absorption occurs . <p> The level can differ according to how people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ear or pulls out . Some models leak RF through the phone 's dial-pad into the person 's cheek . <p> But that 1.6 setting is somewhat arbitrary , says physiologist Ross Adey of Loma Linda University School of Medicine , an expert on RF energy . <p> " There 's not a precipice that means below 1.6 is safe and above you 're going to get a brain tumor , " Adey said . <p> Independent analysts say giving the public more information about radiation levels probably will not dampen booming consumer appetite for wireless phones . <p> But some consumers do worry . A Maryland brain tumor patient recently filed an $800 million lawsuit against cell phone makers . And doctors at the National Cancer Institute say brain tumor patients frequently ask if cell phones were to blame . More radiation hits skin around the ear and cheek than penetrates the skull to the brain , yet there is no panic about skin cancer . <p> " When patients with brain tumors ask , I tell them that every neurosurgeon that I know regularly uses a cell phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's neurosurgery chief . <p> Six of every 100,000 Americans gets a brain tumor each year , whether they used a phone or not . Brain tumor incidence has risen since the 1970s . But starting in 1990 , brain tumor rates inched down again , about 1.4 percent a year , until 1997 , the latest date available . <p> Cell phone use did not begin skyrocketing until around 1996 , so the statistics are not definitive . Critics question whether using a cell phone for many years might eventually increase someone 's risk . <p> To tell , most safety studies have been performed on tissue exposed to RF energy in laboratory dishes , or performed on animals . Most are reassuring ; a few raised questions . The FDA is focusing on test-tube research that discovered RF-exposed human blood cells developed genetic damage , called micronuclei . That type of damage can be one of several steps needed for a cell to turn cancerous , explained FDA scientist Russell Owen . <p> Now the FDA has ordered follow-up studies to see if the finding is a real concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation level , or SAR , about 10 times higher than people typically absorb to cause damage in the initial study . <p> But reliable answers require huge human studies . French scientists are comparing 1,500 brain tumor patients with 1,500 healthy people to see if cell phone use made any difference ; results are due in about three years . <p> A smaller but eagerly awaited NCI study of U.S. brain-tumor patients has been accepted by a major medical journal but will not be published until at least January . NCI is mum until then about whether it will ease Americans ' fears . <p> Until then , the FDA says worried consumers have an easy answer : Just use one of those headset devices that let you talk while keeping the phone held away from your body . <p> On the Net : <p> Food and Drug Administration 's Center for Devices and Radiological Health : http : **33;2988;TOOLONG <p> National Cancer Institute site : http : //www.cancer.gov <p> Federal Communications Commission site on radiation levels : http : //www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid/ <p> Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association : http : //www.wow-com.com
