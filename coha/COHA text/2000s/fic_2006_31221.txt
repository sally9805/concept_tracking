Prologue I was the lone Occidental in a room full of Chinamen , and all of them were talking at once . On either side of me , they were arguing with one another , chanting in unison , or beating the wooden floor with their rope-soled shoes . There was a good deal of wagering going on , with both English pounds and Chinese taels changing hands quickly . Despite the heat of such activity , there was a chill in the room as the smoky breath from all of us condensed overhead in a fog amid the old gray timbers of the quayside warehouse . I pulled my coat closer about me and wished I were at home in my room with my feet on the fender in front of a good fire , where any sane person would be on a dreary February evening , while the chant continued to boom in my ears . " Shi Shi Ji ! Shi Shi Ji ! Shi Shi Ji ! " As luck would have it , they were chanting one of the few Mandarin phrases I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known by among the Chinese . Where he was at the moment I could n't say , but he would be coming along shortly , of that I was certain . A hundred or more Chinamen were massed impatiently around this sunken ring I 'm sure Scotland Yard would be very interested to know about , and there was to be a fight soon . I seriously doubtedwhether anyone besides myself here had ever heard of the Marquis of Queensberry rules . There was movement in the ring , and I leaned forward with a sudden sick feeling in my stomach , but it was only a troupe of Chinese acrobats . A girl of fourteen balanced her twin sister upright , head to head , with but a fold of cloth between them , and a fellow flopped about the ring on his stomach like a seal , but their efforts were jeered at by the audience . I might have been entertained by their performance myself under other circumstances , but I had not come here to be entertained . Shortly , my employer would be coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both our lives . I brushed aside Asians attempting to sell me treats of dried squid and unidentifiable meat on wooden skewers , trying to concentrate on the matter at hand . I looked about the room at the faces of the three men I knew . Old Quong , father of my employer 's late assistant , had his hands on the rail in front of the pit and was watching the acrobats anxiously . Jimmy Woo , an interpreter for the Asiatic Aid Society , was absently chewing on his knuckle through his glove , in danger of gnawing a hole in the silk . Ho , one of Barker 's closest friends , had his hands in the sleeves of his quilted jacket and a sour look upon his face . All of them looked down into the ring as solemnly as if they were watching Barker 's coffin pass by . The acrobats gave up their poor efforts to entertain the crowd and fled . Cyrus Barker stepped out of the shadow into the nimbus shed by torches set into the arena 's structure . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist and ankles in the Chinese manner , and his forearms were encased in leather gauntlets covered with metal studs . Despite the cold , he wore a sleeveless shirt with a mandarin collar , and from fifteen feet away I could see the burns , marks , and tattoos on his brawny arms , souvenirs of his initiations into many secret societies . I remarked to myself how , with his broad nose , black hair , and swarthy skin , he had successfully passed himself off as an Oriental for many years prior to returning to the West . In place of his usual black-lensed spectacles , his eyes were now hidden behind a pair of round , India-rubber goggles I had never seen before . At the sight of him , everyone began chanting his name even louder , and more wagers changed hands ; but Barker ignored them and began warming up , loosening his joints and stretching . My tension eased a little . The Guv seemed confident , and why should n't he ? He was six feet two inches tall , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in the room . Given the short notice before the fight , what sort of fellow could they have found to face a man as formidable as he ? As if in answer to my thoughts , another man stepped into the ring , and I felt my stomach fall away . If the crowd was excited before , it went into a frenzy now . The wagers redoubled now that the combatants could be compared . Ho shot me a cold glance after we had both surveyed the opponent , and his eyes were reduced to mere slits in his face . I knew what he was thinking . It was the same thing I had been thinking myself since we 'd been brought here : this was all my fault , mine alone . Barker was down there about to begin the fight of his life because of my mistakes . If I had n't followed the girl , if I had n't fought the Chinese , if I had n't lost the dog , then perhaps ... Well , perhaps I should start at the beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
