This study examines students ' perceptions of reference letters . Students ( n=444 ) were asked to describe how they perceived reference letters . Four themes were uncovered . First , some students perceived reference letters as useful for employers . Second , some students perceived the letters as important for students seeking employment or admission to law or graduate school . Third , some students identified specific problems they had with the letters ( e.g. , distance education students ) . Finally , some students perceived the letters as entirely useless . Implications are provided . <p> The purpose of a college education for most students is very practical  --  they want to prepare themselves to get a job ( Leppel , 2005 ; Payne and Sumter , 2005 ) . While they may not know what job they want , which career is right for them , or how to go about getting the job , by the end of their four ( or five or six ) years of college , what they want out of their education is gainful employment . Employers base their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work history , success in the educational arena , and potential for success in a specific job . Measuring the potential for success is not an easy task . Job references are just one tool that is used to determine such potential . <p> Most of what has been written about job references has focused on legal issues surrounding references for those providing references about certain individuals ( Hirschfield , 2004 ; Picker , 1992 ; Rovella , 1995 ; Taylor , 1998 ) , strategies employers can use to conduct effective reference checks ( Andrica , 1998 ; Picker , 1992 ) , and what employees can do to improve their likelihood of getting the job they want ( Pechter , 1997 ) . <p> The legally-oriented articles address the risks for liability and strategies to avoid being sued . One recent legal issue centers on the use of email to share reference letters . Questions center on whether such a process violates the Data Protection Act of 1998 ( Taylor , 1998 ) . Another legal issue related to job references entails the ability of states to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 ) . More recently , attention has centered on ways colleges and universities are liable for references provided by instructors , professors , and other university employees ( Hirschfield , 2004 ) . <p> Research on effectively conducting job reference checks has centered on a number of different issues including the appropriate techniques to use , the types of questions to ask , and the relative weight to afford to references . One author considered the way employers should go about interviewing references , rather than relying solely on letters provided by the references ( Andrica , 1998 ) . In particular , among others , Andrica advises that the following questions should be asked of potential employees ' references : <p>  --  What are this person 's strengths ? <p>  --  Can you cite an example illustrating these strengths ? <p>  --  What accomplishments or successes did this individual demonstrate in your organization ? <p>  --  If you were to offer any advice or constructive criticism , what would you tell this person ? ( p. 532 ) <p> The responses to these questions are believed to be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usefulness of job references has centered on strategies employees can use to improve their likelihood of being hired ( Pechter , 1997 ) . According to Pechter , networking will help individuals better prepare themselves for subsequent employment . One employment consultant advises that job seekers improve their chances of employment by : <p>  --  Asking past employers what kind of reference they will provide <p>  --  Confirming references in advance <p>  --  Calling references before a potential employer calls them <p>  --  Not overburdening references by listing them for jobs in which the applicant has no interest <p>  --  Offering to serve as a reference for one 's references ( OfficeSolutions , 2003 ) . <p> While research has examined aspects of job references related to employers ' liability , strategies to use them appropriately , and ways employees can use references effectively , very little research has considered how students perceive job references . Such research is useful because it will help determine if students ' perceptions of job references will help or hinder their abilities to gain employment , which as noted earlier , is the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Dominion University ( n = 444 ) completed a voluntary survey conducted by the members of the Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice Department at Old Dominion University . The majority of the students that completed the survey were criminal justice , sociology or human service majors . Respondents were undergraduate students , ranging in age from seventeen to fifty-seven . The survey consisted of several close-ended questions relating to different social problems . At the end of the survey , students were asked to describe their perceptions of reference letters . Five close-ended questions were included as well as one open-ended question : What are your thoughts about reference letters ? For the purpose of this analysis , we content analyzed their responses to this question . Findings <p> Overall , reference letters were found to be an overall positive element . Responses such as " They are great , " " They are good , " " They are helpful , " and " I feel that reference letters are a useful tool , " and " They are needed " are some of the comments that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference letters . Beyond these general findings , our content analysis revealed four themes characterizing students ' perceptions about reference letters . These themes included ( 1 ) useful for employers , ( 2 ) useful for students , ( 3 ) problematic for some students , and ( 4 ) useless for all . <p> Useful for Employers <p> Perhaps the most common theme was that students tended to view reference letters as tools useful for employers . For example , one student said , " They are a good way for employers to see how others in society view your character . " Making virtually the same comment , another student said , " They are good to use as a character witness of the applicant . " Below are a few other examples of comments illustrating the useful for employers themes : <p>  --  I think they are important part when an employer decides whether to hire you or not . <p>  --  I think they are good , gives you a little more about what the person is like . <p>  --  They just provide employers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>  --  Reference letters give an employer or a college a better idea of the personality and work ethic of the applicant . <p>  --  They are a good way for employers to see how others in society view your character . <p>  --  They are important because they enable the future employer to get to know the person through someone else 's eyes . <p> Some students relied on their own experience as managers or supervisors in developing their assessments about reference letters . Three students with past experience hiring students made the following comments : <p>  --  I think reference letters are a good way for employers to get to know their applicants . It 's the one true way to get to know who they are besides calling the references . I think reference letters are a positive thing . <p>  --  I 've hired people before with both good and bad references and the ones with good references are always the good employees . The ones with bad references are always the ones that quit right away or get fired . I think they are a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea of what type of person you truly are . A 4.00 GPA does n't tell as much as a written statement from someone who has dealt with you on a professional level . <p> Useful for Students <p> A second theme that arose is that many students tended to see reference letters rather introspectively , or as tools that will help them . The areas in which reference letters were cited as being most useful included gaining admission to college and attaining employment . Said one student of reference letters , " They help students get in to better college . " Another student said , " They are important for getting into graduate school . " <p> Indeed , comments such as " They help you get the job " and " I think they are very important when it comes to getting a particular job " were common examples of the usefulness to students theme . <p> A few other students expanded on why they thought the letters helped them get jobs . Here are a few of examples of these more detailed assessments of job references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they must reflect the qualities that I have . I also like to know how people think about me and it may give me a chance to enhance some of my qualities <p>  --  Reference letters are very crucial when it comes to getting a specific job that meets all the criteria and expectations that you personally want and need . <p>  --  They are important because it gives an idea on what you are like and how well and how hard you work from a respected member of society . <p> Problematic for Some Students <p> Another theme that arose is that some students felt that reference letters were problematic in specific contexts or situations . Those situations which were problematic were case in which students ( 1 ) have a high employment potential but no faculty contacts and ( 2 ) are enrolled in distance education programs . <p> With regard to the first group of students who would be good employees but have no faculty references , some students implied that the job references do not adequately address the true nature of the student as a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too highly regarded . A person could be more capable for the job and have no references and some nobody has been could have references and get the job . <p> Another student made a similar comment stating , " Maybe you have no references ; it does n't make you less valuable than another . " Other comments made by students which seemed to indicate that they have the same or similar perceptions of reference letters include the following statements by four different students : <p>  --  They only show positive aspects when sometimes the negative needs to be shown . <p>  --  Adds positive things to resume but not overly important , good to have though . <p>  --  Reference letters do n't always portray or reflect who the person really is . <p>  --  I think reference letters are somewhat skewed because they are usually written by a person who likes the one who the letter is from , and the writer will probably tell the good qualities of a person . <p> With regard to distance education and reference letters , unique to Old Dominion University is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although effective , in terms of reference letters , this program proposes challenges in terms of obtaining reference letters . The following is some of what TELETECHNET students had to say about reference letters : <p>  --  Being in a TELETECHNET class , I feel that a reference letter wo n't do too much good . <p>  --  I am a TTN student so it would be harder for me to request reference letters from someone who does n't know me and has never met me . Plus you may never contact the professor but only their graduate assistant . I wonder what the letter would say . All they have for their opinion of me is my grade . <p> Although some TTN students feel that they may have a hard time acquiring a reference letter from an employer , their overall comments were similar to on campus students in that some found them beneficial , and others found them to be biased and not important . <p> Useless for All Students <p> Additionally , another theme that emerged from the surveys was that many students find reference letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said one student , " They are of little value . " Another student made a similar comment stating , " I question their effectiveness . " Another student said that reference letters are " inaccurate and biased . " Other comments displaying this theme of the uselessness of references letters include the following comments from two different students : <p>  --  They are a waste of time and effort . You only get them from people that you know will give you a good one . You always come across as good . <p>  --  I 'm not sure if they serve a great deal of purpose . No one is going to ask a professor to write a reference letter unless they know it will be positive . <p> In summary , the majority of students responded that they think that reference letters are good , helpful , necessary , and important . Similarly , the majority also expressed that reference letters focus on the positive aspects of the individual . Some viewed this particular aspect as an okay thing , while others found it the factor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student 's responses indicate a type of guarded optimism towards reference letters , those that write them , and those that read them . Discussion <p> The results of our study are interesting and suggest that students have mixed perceptions about the usefulness of reference letters . Some students held reference letters in high regard for either employers or students , others noted problems they had with reference letters , and other described reference letters as useless . Based on our findings , a number of recommendations can be made so that professors can better utilize reference letters for students . <p> First , students should be made aware of the usefulness of job references . Related to the importance of references is the whole process of networking . In many cases , employees are given opportunities to interview for jobs because of who they know , not what they know . Incoming freshmen need to be made aware of the importance of getting to know their professors so that they are able to ask them for references . Learning the trade of networking with their professors will help students network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that students who encounter problems with reference letters can be better represented . Consider students enrolled in distance education programs . Strategies may need to be developed for distance education students so that they aware of how to seek out job references . Likewise , strategies may need to be developed for faculty members so that they recognize the importance of serving distance education students the same way as traditional students . <p> Third , students should be encouraged to seek reference letters even before they graduate . If professors are willing to provide them , students should request a general reference letter for their files , whether they are seeking a job , graduate school , or law school . Such letters fulfill two instrumental purposes for students . First , the letters provide students with the faculty member 's insight into their potential for success . Second , and more importantly , if students wait too long ( even a semester or two ) , the faculty member may very well forget about the specifics of the student 's strengths and have problems writing a solid letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either use that letter later in time when needed or supply the faculty member with a copy years down the road in those cases when an updated letter is needed . <p> Finally , to make the reference letter process more useful for students , professors should empower students to assist in the letter writing process . Some professors have asked students to write their own letters only to have the professor sign the letter . While this may work for advanced graduate students , undergraduates will likely be too timid to provide the letter . Moral and ethical issues also arise with this process . Instead , when we suggest empowering students in the process , what we mean is that students should be prepared to ask for reference letters appropriately and provide enough information so that accurate letters can be developed . <p> In particular , faculty should consider asking students for the following products before doing their reference letters : <p>  --  Student 's updated resume . If the professor knows what the student has done and plans to do , he or she can speak about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student . This is not about the budget crisis . It 's about making it easier to get the letter in the mail , especially if the professor is working from home . Also , the professor can make sure it is being sent to the right place . <p>  --  Unofficial transcript . The professor wants to know what courses students have had , their minor , and their grades . <p>  --  List of classes the student has had with the professor . It is impossible for professors to remember all students . They need to be reminded about specifics . <p>  --  Reminder about the papers the student wrote in the professor 's class . If the professor can say something about the student 's writing ability , it will certainly help . <p>  --  Copy of the student 's senior project if it is available . Professors ca n't make things up about the student 's writing abilities . They need to be reminded with concrete examples . <p>  --  List of accomplishments students are most proud of . Professors need to know what students are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more " personal " and relevant for employers . <p> Students should also be encouraged to only ask faculty members who they know will give them a good reference . There is nothing worse than getting a lukewarm reference . Students are probably better off with no reference than they are with a generic one . They should be told ahead of time by their advisors or instructors that refusals to provide reference letters should be seen as a favor professors are doing students . <p> In the end , it is important that students realize that references can be the " icing on the cake " that gets them their job or into graduate school or law school . It 's not just the letter that is important ; rather , it is the student 's ability to network with professors so that he or she is prepared to network in their future careers . While a good reference may not in and of itself get someone their favored job or admission to graduate school , a bad reference will most assuredly seal their fate . <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
