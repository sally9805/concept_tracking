<p> Many people just love Christmas , and some people are . . . a little obsessed . <p> You know these people : Their houses look like spaceships , what with all those Christmas lights . Scores of Santas twinkle from their windows ; wreaths and garlands drape their staircases . Dozens of Nativity figurines crowd tables and shelves . <p> And they have trees  --  oh , boy , do they have trees . Small and tall , groaning with themed ornaments , in green , white , pink , whatever . Trees for the kids , trees for the grandparents , trees for the dog , trees for the dog that died . They have five trees , 20 trees , even 50 trees  --  jammed into modest ramblers , tiny townhouses , studio apartments . These are people who put trees in every room of their house , even the bathrooms . <p> Who are these people ? Many of them are collectors , especially of Christmas ornaments , which are produced in staggering numbers every year in the USA . Hallmark alone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 200 new ones every year . A person who has hundreds or thousands of ornaments  --  and there are plenty who do  --  needs lots of trees . <p> But more than that , these particular tree-huggers are people who get high on the holidays . " I just love Christmas , ever since high school , " says Joy Laughlin , 48 , of Taylorville , Ill. , who put up 34 trees this year , starting on Veterans Day and finishing just before Thanksgiving . " When I got married , I started out with five , but I 've been adding more since then . " <p> Their spouses despair , their neighbors snicker and grumble , their children think they 're uncool . But they do n't care ; they are too exhilarated by their decorating frenzies , too emotional about every tree and ornament and what each one means . Every year is a chance to reconnect with the past , just by unpacking their trees . ( The trees are all artificial , by the way ; it 's enough having to decorate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tradition made for memories <p> " I am a Christmas tree junkie , " declares Rebecca Eckard , 27 , a graphic designer and mother of two in Hickory , N.C. , who puts up four trees every year . " I love decorating each one in my collection because of its meaning and its history , " especially a vintage 1960s 4-foot aluminum tree that was a gift from a co-worker . This tree is a " constant Christmas mortification " to her husband , she giggles . <p> Barb Hoatson , 55 , a grandmother in Sutherland , Neb. , says she wants a tree " for each special remembrance in my life , " which means putting up a half-dozen , including one in memory of her family 's recently departed Scottish terrier , J.J. " We can laugh in remembrance of how she had to touch each ornament with her nose to check it out . If we try real hard , we 'll probably see her still , " Hoatson says . <p> Susan Ashmore , 43 , of Pisgah Forest , N.C , says her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she puts up 49 trees . This year , because she 's still recovering from lung surgery , she put up " only " 15 . But she plans to rebound in a big way . Next year : 57 trees . <p> " Living in a retirement community when you are n't retired leaves you with entirely too much time on your hands , " jokes Ashmore , who works in electrical sales when she 's not working on her trees . <p> A partial list of her tree themes : mice , Winnie the Pooh , patriotic , Disney , The Wizard of Oz , outer space , folk art , religious , Peanuts , copper , fairies , birds , Eskimos and polar bears , three blown glass trees , four angel trees , three Santa trees , two snowman trees and four animal trees . Her husband is resigned to his fate , but her 15-year-old daughter refuses to have a tree in her bedroom or even in the hallway near her bedroom . <p> " The troubles and stress of everyday life go away when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're like old friends . " <p> Multiple Christmas trees are n't new ; in Germany , where the Christmas tree tradition originated , it 's customary in some regions to put up a tree for each member of the family . In the USA , where the Christmas tree did n't become universal until the early 20th century , the multiple-tree movement took off after the ornament market exploded in the early 1980s . <p> Bob Pranga , aka Dr. Christmas , the holiday decorator to the stars in Los Angeles , agrees that retailers , not tradition , are behind the American trend . " Very few of us grew up with 19 Christmas trees in our own home , " he says wryly . But mostly , he says , it 's all about " human excess " and our inability to " settle for just one . " <p> Take social worker Donna Hicks , 49 , of Palmyra , Neb. : " I 'm one of those people that if one is good , six is better . I have six trees , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christmas cookie jars and teapots , and many , many flamingos  --  even a flamingo Christmas tree . " I 'm just a little crazy about Christmas . " Just a little . <p> How to explain such behavior ? " As people drop their vices , their smoking or drinking and everything bad for you , Christmas has become the new addiction , " Dr. Christmas says . " It can be a very benign but very expensive habit . " <p> And a lot of work . More than a few tree junkies concede that they are exhausted by the unpacking and decorating ; it 's partly why so many leave their trees up long after spring flowers have bloomed . Most have attics and basements jammed with trees , plus 150 to 200 boxes of ornaments and decorations . In Gulfport , Miss. , Susan Watts rents a climate-controlled storage building just to protect the decorations for the four trees she puts up every year . <p> Do n't think tree decorating is just a female thing ; some guys do it , too . Bob Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ill. , puts up six trees now that he has moved into a house big enough to accommodate his thousands of ornaments and 400 sheep figurines ( other people collect Nativity creches ; Burke collects the sheep that go in the creches ) . <p> " We 're crazy ; we 're mad , " Burke half-jokes about his tree-decorating habits . " When I started putting up the lights this time , I thought why ? " <p> Decorations are for admiring <p> Some people do it to please their friends and family , having made multiple trees a new tradition . Others host open houses and parties to show off their decorations . <p> Twin schoolteachers Janice and Joyce Maples , 55 , of Decatur , Ala. , put up a dozen trees every year ; last year , 120 people came to see them . They grew up the daughters of a sharecropper , so Christmas was sparse : a cedar tree from the farm , no lights , sweet gum balls for ornaments , snow made from washing powder and water , and one gift per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and talking about where we got the ornaments as we put them on the tree , " Janice says . " It 's fun to share your happiness with friends . " <p> Some people even conduct tours for total strangers . " They may come as a stranger , but they leave as a friend , and we have met so many people over the years , " says Virginia Routch , 70 . Since 1988 , she and her husband , Wendell , 73 , have conducted nightly free tours from Thanksgiving to mid-January of their modest home in Hastings , Pa. , which they turn into a holiday decorating extravaganza : 17 trees , 10,000 lights , animated Christmas villages outside and multiple train sets in the basement . <p> One year , a young woman with cancer came to see the trees ; six weeks later , after she had died , her mother wrote to say she had had so much fun that day . " It has made a lot of people happy , " Virginia says . " To bring a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
