Montreal , Europe 's pied-a-terre in North America , went through a grim economic patch in the ' 80s and early ' 90s , when it had clearly lost its panache . The threat of Quebec separatism and a prolonged Canadian recession sapped its economic life . So many shops were shut that the city began to look more like struggling Buffalo , N.Y. , than Paris . Today , though , this charming city is experiencing the kind of renaissance that old cities like Dublin and Prague have seen in recent decades . Chic new businesses , such as fashionista Fidel or juice purveyor Moozoo , are popping up seemingly everywhere . The economy is solid ; and , best of all , there is a new sense of optimism that makes Montreal 's streets , restaurants and bars a rejuvenating pleasure . <P> That 's evident in the first-class boutique hotels recently built in the city 's large stock of grand old buildings . The most sumptuous is the Hotel Le St-James ( 514-841-3111 ) , which was fashioned out of a 130-year-old merchant-bank building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique furniture and **25;17155;TOOLONG , marble-encased bathrooms can alight here for $300 to $3,750 a night . A bit pricey , non ? " Our guests do n't ask the price , they ask for the square footage , " sniffs the hotel 's directeur-general Guy Luzy . If price does matter , try the Hotel Gault ( 514-904-1616 ) , a minimalist gem where classic 20th century fixtures and furniture are set against bare white , oak or hot-rolled-steel walls and concrete floors . Tucked away on a quiet Old Montreal street , the Gault 's design aesthetic is so gaunt that a visitor can barely make out the insignia by the front door . Rooms are $170 to $435 . <P> Once ensconced , set out to sample the food in one of North America 's great dining capitals . In the preen-and-be-seen category is downtown 's Cavalli ( 514-843-5100 ) , where sumptuous nouvelle cuisine Italienne is served in a hot-pink and wasabi-colored decor best described as Felliniesque . You can lounge in a fishbowl setting , supping on the likes of macaroni with fontina and cheddar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , this is a French town , and you ca n't go wrong at Toque ! ( 514-499-2084 ) for fresh , local gastronomic creations . The place is 10 years old , but thanks to the ever inventive chef-owner Normand Laprise , Toque ! never bores . It 's perhaps the best of the market-cuisine restaurants in the city . Less elegant but just as inventive is the newish Au Pied de Cochon ( 514-281-1114 ) , where iconoclastic chef Martin Picard throws coronary caution to the wind with his heavy and delectable pork , venison , lamb , poultry and fish dishes in seasonal dress . His foie gras-poutine appetizer ( pate atop a version of the Quebecois snack of fries , cheese curd and gravy ) typifies his highbrow-lowbrow approach .
