Social note from the unreal winter of 1939 , at the precipice of world war : Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy reported in his London diary that when he dined at Lady Astor 's , he noticed that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had a hole in his sock . <P> Joe Kennedy , pirate and paterfamilias , son of a Boston Irish saloonkeeper , delighted in the company of the royals . During lunch at Windsor Castle in April 1939 , Kennedy told his diary , " Somebody at table discovered a ladybug and Princess Elizabeth suggested it was good luck and sent it along to the Prime Minister . So it came along on a gold spoon , one from another , and I handed it to the Queen , and then she tried to tip it out on the Prime Minister 's shoulder , most gently ... " <P> But let American involvement end with dinners and ladybugs . Kennedy hated the idea of the U.S. being drawn into the looming European catastrophe . His patriotism was genuine but isolationist and , in the Kennedy way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from London in something like disgrace , dismissed as an appeaser and defeatist . <P> It was in part a tribal impulse that led Amanda Smith , a 33-year-old Harvard graduate student who is a granddaughter of Joe Kennedy and daughter of Jean Kennedy Smith and Stephen Smith , to embark on the project of sifting through some 600,000 pages of Ambassador Kennedy 's papers in order to produce Hostage to Fortune , The Letters of Joseph P. Kennedy ( Viking ; 764 pages ; $39.95 ) . As Smith describes it , her search through the often crumbling documents ( some uncatalogued at the JFK Library in Boston , some forgotten in a warehouse in Long Island City , N.Y. , and others found in the attic above the room in Hyannis Port , Mass. , where Joe Kennedy died in 1969 ) has a quality of the newsreel reporter 's quest for Charles Foster Kane . <P> Smith has not found the sled with the rosebud on it . Those who thought Kennedy an odious character will not find much ammunition , although the letters are disfigured here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities , as Smith says in a lovely introduction that is both haunted and haunting : He was father , speculator , film producer , bootlegger , chairman ( of the SEC and the Federal Maritime Commission ) , philanderer , philanthropist , kingmaker.
