Chapter One : Libyan Desert October 11 There 's no rhyme or reason as to how the mind of a soldier works in battle . Men holed up in a farmhouse will cook dinner in the middle of a sniper attack , setting the table with a checkered cloth and folded napkins , a platter of sliced fruit and cheese sitting in the center , like they were chefs in some Italian joint back home . You find that you do n't think they 're nuts for longer than that first stunned moment , that one second of rational thought in a place where hell 's a-popping and nothing makes sense . If there 's no guarantee of a tomorrow , you need normalcy to ground you . And it 's then you realize that maybe those cookin ' fools have got a helluva good idea . You sit yourself down with them and stuff your face , while the whole damn war is going on around you . You see a soldier fall into a ditch of mud and dead men , then come crawling out more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle . It sounds insane , but when you have the chance to , you squat behind a tree , bullets flying around you , and there , behind that tree , for just one second , you pull out your own wallet and flip open the pictures . In a bar or at a canteen dance , when some dame finds out you 've been in combat , she asks questions like , " Before a battle , do you think about heaven ? " No . " Do you think about dying ? " No . You 're too damn afraid to . You might jinx yourself . You decide early on that no matter how much the enemy shoots at you , you 'll be damned if you 're going to get hit . Kitty asked one night , " Do n't you ever get scared ? " Everyone gets scared . Fear keeps you alive . But once you see the enemy , you do n't have much time to be afraid . Or to think about it . The truth is , it 's fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lived with that kind of fear every waking minute . Maybe that was the night they fell in love , when they were alone , spilling their guts to each other , thinking life made no sense because they were damn near freezing to death in the middle of the Sahara Desert . Just like now . He was back in North Africa , in the desert again just before dawn , where it was still and quiet . The sand was hard and bare and so cold it was like lying on snow . Through a perimeter of wooden crossed-stakes and entangled wire stood his objectivea bowl of Axis trouble hollowed out of an endless range of sand dunes in the Libyan desert . Dim lights downlit the corners of the buildings and the northeast side of the compound , where a convoy of trucks and tanks were lined up for fueling at first light . From here it looked like a movie set , the type of place Gary Cooper stormed in Beau Geste . But this was 1942 , a different time , a different war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Allied mission Foxfire would begin . Their job : to infiltrate Rommel 's compound . Ten minutes after that , they would blow everything sky-high : the compound , the largest Deutsches Afrika Korps supply dump in the desert , and the Jadgwaffe 's airfield . He checked his watch ... every few minutes . Time moved at glacial speed . Seconds and minutesmeasurements of a lifetime that have little meaning by themselves . He waited . Tense . Edgy . Until 0400 . This was it . He clipped a hole in the wire and moved forward , shimmying down a dune and up over another like some kind of desert viper . " Halt ! " He froze at the edge of the dunes , half afraid to look up because he did n't know if he would be staring into the barrel of a Kar98k or if the voice he 'd heard had carried up from below . Lt. Colonel J.R . Cassidy raised his head slowly to find he was alone in the dunes . But below and from out of nowhere , a troop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through darkness , sudden and glaring . The place lit up like a ball field in October . Rommel 's men had been waiting for them . U.S. Army Air Force Captain Red Walker set the last charge on the supply bunker , grabbed his munitions pack and rifle , then slung each over a shoulder . He moved quietly along the concrete edges of the supply building . At the east corner , he stopped before making a cold run for it . He 'd seen men lay their charges , then act like jackrabbits and get their fool heads shot off . A hundred feet of open space stood between him and the cover from a stack of Nazi oil drums . He had four minutes to get to the airfield before everything blew . Four minutes that could feel like a lifetime , or an instant . A German officer stood in the middle of the yard , between him and those barrels . Red could try to take him out , but that was chancy . The guy was standing in the middle of the compound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head against the building and waited . Overhead was a clear night sky that sucked all the day 's heat from the loose desert sand . The air was cold as ice . Twenty-two degrees had been predicted at the final briefing . Yet here he was sweating . Nothing made much sense anymore . War changed things . Everything . The whole goddamn world felt upside-down , sideways , and jackass-backwards . For years all he 'd wanted was to get out of Acme , Texas . But here he was in the middle of the desert , blowing up the compound of a man he 'd never seen , an enemy from a place as far away from Wilbarger County as a rattlesnake was from the North Pole . He waited a few more minutes , then stared out past the perimeter at the desert beyond and mile after mile of nothing but sand dunes . Hell ... and people said West Texas was an armpit . He checked his watch again , then wiped away the sweat that trickled into his eyes . His mouth was drier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about a big old Texas-sized glass of tea , sweetened with a handful of white sugar and poured over two handfuls of ice ... about bluebonnets growing beside the road and the clean smell of a woman who washed her hair with lemon . He shook his head and shifted , then looked around the corner . The officer had n't moved . Three minutes . Should he run ? He eased back , chewed it over . He 'd wait . Once his charges blew , it would n't matter if he had to fire his rifle . It would n't matter if he fired a two-ton ack-ack . It would be too late . The den of the Fox would be on fire . Cassidy had been on a dozen of these missions . He claimed the difference between living and dying was in the timing . He 'd said it to Red and others over and over . Time it exactly . If you rush , you die . If you wait too long , someone else dies . Instinct screamed inside Red 's head , Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He asked himself how much of that instinct was fueled by panic . Panic could kill you or make you a hero , depending on how the chips fell . But thinking clearly , well , Cassidy said that was what saved your sweet ass . The soldier in him checked his watch again . Thirty seconds more . He began to mentally count it off . Twenty-eight ... Twenty-five ... Twenty-two ... Twenty seconds . " Halt ! " Sweet Jesus .... The order was distant , as if it came from the truck depot . But sound carried in the desert like it did over water . Compound spotlights came on as white and blinding as the Texas sun in July . Enemy soldiers ran out from the shadows . One of them was heading right toward him . Next to the compound , a German bomber , a Junkers 88P , taxied down the narrow desert airstrip past a line of burning Messerschmitts , ME 109s . A smoking Panzer tank blocked the end of the runway . Two more planes blew up , Stukas , now nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply ; it was the only aircraft on the field left in one piece , and it was moving toward the compound . An armored car marked with the Deutsches Afrika Korps palm tree and mounted with a machine gun came speeding in from the road and raced by the plane , the soldiers inside the vehicle motioning to the pilot to follow them . The car careened in front of the bomber , leading the way , so the pilot slowed the plane a notch and moved in directly behind the machine gunner ; they both headed for an Allied half-track stalled a few hundred feet away . The Junkers 's nose guns swiveled , sighting a target . Too high . The pilot shoved forward on the yoke , hit the brakes , and powered the tail ; then he pressed down on the trigger and fired so many deadly rounds there was a gaping hole in the Korps vehicle where the palm tree and swastika had once been . British Royal Air Force Pilot Commander George " Skip " Inskip released the trigger button and reduced power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jar that would have rattled his teeth if they had n't been clenched so damned tight . He looked ahead of him and taxied the plane closer toward the fence , on solid ground between the airfield and the supply dump . There was chaos in the compound . Smoke and fire . Am I the only one left ? That was a balmy thought , and not bloody likely . Along for the ride today were the Long Range Desert Group , those Desert Rats who gave Rommel hell ; the SIG , experts who made successes of suicide missions ; and the Yanks , two of them , commando-trained and specially picked by the OSS . Cassidy was a miracle-working scrounger who had a reputation for doing the impossible , and Walker , an ex-Air Corps pilot , sharpshooter , and demolitions expert , a tall , quiet Texan who hated Skip with everything he had in him . Perhaps Walker had already corked it . On some level , Skip understood Walker 's hatred of him . He just did n't care . Charley would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Charley still believed he was square and aboveboard . Skip looked ahead . The compound was burning , the fuel depot destroyed . And they had a dog 's chance of getting out . A moment later a man burst through an orange wall of fire and smoke . The soldier disappeared under the plane 's wing before Skip could get a look at him . The belly door of the JU suddenly opened . Hot air and smoke blew into the cockpit . Hell .... Skip pulled his revolver , an Enfield No.2MK , and turned , one hand still on the controls . " Do n't shoot , you limey son of a bitch , or you 'll have to explain to Charley that you were the one who killed me . " Red Walker pulled himself up and inside , then rolled into the cockpit and strapped into the copilot 's seat . Skip shoved the gun back into his holster . " Where 's Cassidy ? " " Last time I spotted him he was crawling down into the bunker . But that was before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around them . " Where are you taking this thing ? The airfield is back that way . " " Tanks are blocking the runway . The place is lit up like a parade ground . I 'm heading for the macadam , " Skip said . " The airfield 's useless . " He gave the plane too much power and hit the road too fast . Beast of a machine was heavier than the fighters he was used to . " Stop ! " Walker was half turned in his seat looking out the glass . " I see Cassidy ! He lost his helmet . I can see his blond head ! " " Most of the bloody Afrika Korps have blond heads . " " It was him . " " Did you plant the charges to blow both bunkers ? " Skip kept going . " Yes . " " Did the command bunker blow ? " " Yes . " " Did you see Cassidy get out ? " " No , but I was a little busy with about half a platoon of mad-as-hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Skip checked the time and kept going . " We were supposed to be out of here five minutes ago . Cassidy is n't here . The bunker 's gone . This mission has had it . " It looked like hell was coming up to meet them . Everything was burning . " Look ! " Walker glanced back out the window . " We 've done what damage we can to this place . I 'm taking this plane up now . " Skip reached for the throttle switch . A pistol cocked next to his temple , the cold ring of the barrel pressed into his skin . " No , " Walker said quietly . " You 're going to wait . " " I could kill you for this . " " By golly , you sure could . " " If I report your actions , your army would have you court-martialed . " Walker shrugged . " I could pull this trigger and there would n't be a report or a court-martial . " Skip laughed bitterly . " Just a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you Brits always say ... a bloody mess . " Walker checked his watch . Tension hung between them , second after second after second . He looked out the window , but apparently saw no one , because he checked his watch again . He faced Skip but did n't move the gun . " Three minutes more . If Cassidy is n't here , you can hit the throttle for all she 's worth . " Skip braked , then sat there , arms resting on the yoke , waiting . Walker did n't drop the gun . " I 'll give Cassidy three minutes , but pull the gun away from my head . " " I was pretty darn young when my granddaddy taught me not to walk around the backside of a pissed-off mule , least not ' less I want to get my marbles kicked to hell and back . I 'll just keep this gun right where it is for now . " From the compound , the sound of gunfire echoed back at them , ticking off time in sputtering rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sitting there next to Red Walker , allies in spirit and duty , but enemies at heart , the barrel of a .32 caliber pistol against his head and the trigger held by the one man who truly wanted him dead . He glanced at Walker , who was n't smiling , but then the Yanks and the British did n't share the same sense of humor . Walker kept watching out the window for Cassidy . So Skip sat there , the smell of fuel and the taste of fire seeping slowly inside the cockpit until it was in every breath he took and his lungs felt tight and full . He checked his watch . " Time 's up . " Red swore one of those off-colored Texas colloquialisms , but he kept his word and holstered the pistol . " These bloody gauges are unreadable . " Skip moved the JU forward . He looked at the short strip of road ahead , the only level spot before the road humped up and down the dunes too deeply for a takeoff . He did n't have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Goddammit , Inskip ! " Red was leaning out the window . " Shitfire and hell ! There 's Cassidy ! He 's running just behind us ! " He pulled his head back inside and glared at Skip . " Look for yourself ! " The engine noise was so loud Skip could barely hear him . " Look , Inskip ! It 's Cassidy ! " Red turned back . " Run , Colonel ! Run ! " " If I stop now , we wo n't make it ! " Skip saw Red turn and look at the gauges , then up at the road ahead . Red was a pilot . He could see the short length of level road . Swearing , Red unbuckled , crawled out of his seat , and slid down into the belly of the plane . A second later Skip heard the belly door drop open and a blast of air hit the back of his head . J.R . jumped the fence , picked up an M , and fired . He had seen Walker hanging out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . kept firing until there was nothing to fire at . Inskip had to be behind the controls of that plane . Damn .... He was late . Those two should have left already . J.R . spun around . Smoke and fire were everywhere . He turned eastward , weapon poised and ready . But there were no enemy troops , just the British Desert Rats in an armored car , hanging on to their seats , guns firing as they sped away and disappeared over the dunes as if they had been a mirage . He turned again . No one was coming at him . Hell , he might just make it . He looked back . The bomber was moving down the blacktop road , its Jumo engines roaring to life . J.R . took off after it . Running ... running ... running . He was close , then closer . He pumped his arms and legs . " Run , Colonel ! Run ! " Walker was hanging out the plane door . He gripped the side of the plane and extended his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faster ! Faster ! I can make it ! I can ! Bullets suddenly ate the ground behind him . Pop ! Pop ! Pop ! Pop ! Pop ! The bullets sounded like popcorn . Firecrackers . Cap guns . They never sounded real . They never sounded like they could kill you .
