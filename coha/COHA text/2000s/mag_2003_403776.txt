Corbett 's Glen looks much as it did a century ago , when this simple , quiet meadow shaped the dreams of one of golf 's greatest champions and one of its greatest personalities . Allen 's Creek still ripples along its border , birds still sing and the trees still sway peacefully in the wind . Located just two miles east of Oak Hill Country Club , site of this year 's PGA Championship in Rochester , New York , the glen borders the property on which Walter C. Hagen was born December 21 , 1892 , in a small house his father built . The Hagen family was neither wealthy nor prominent . Hagen 's mother , , they provided an unlikely beginning  --  humble and stable  --  for a boy who would grow up to play golf with royalty , dine with presidents and be known as " Sir Walter . " Good , thrifty German Presbyterians , the Hagens taught their offspring the value of hard work and sacrifice . While Louise raised the family , kept house and maintained a garden , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards of East Rochester . Hagen may have been an icon of the Roaring ' ' 20s , but his childhood was sheltered and innocent ; he did n't drink or smoke , and he wore trousers that were a little too short . It was a modest , ordinary " small town life , " he recalled in his 1956 autobiography , The Walter Hagen Story . " We had a simple , comfortable home , and good plain food but there was n't much left over for extras . " Hagen 's future began to take shape at age 7 , when he applied for a job as a caddie at the recently opened Country Club of Rochester . He wanted to earn pocket money for ice cream , baseball equipment and other extras his family could n't afford . He quickly became a favorite at the club , where he toted the bags of Rochester 's most powerful men , including George Eastman of the Eastman Kodak Company . It was Hagen 's first brush with wealth , and he quickly became entranced . " I was tremendously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida ... and big game hunting in Africa and India , " Hagen remembered . " I admired the ease with which they spoke of huge money deals . " The game also captured Hagen . " Competition was the factor which drew me , " he wrote . " I played to win , whether it was pool , marbles , baseball , shooting or golf . I liked the feel of a golf club in my hand and I was forever swinging a club . " He took lessons from the club 's pro , Andrew Christy , and spent hours pitching balls to newspapers in his yard or hitting longer shots on a homemade layout in Corbett 's Glen . Relying on a few milk cows to graze and trample down grass for his greens , Hagen created four pitch-and-putt holes and challenged his caddie buddies to penny Nassaus . By the time he was 15 , Hagen had " played more golf and practiced more shots than most young golfers of 21 " and considered himself " capable of taking on anybody within five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club 's assistant professional . Hagen 's other youthful interests were fishing , hunting , basketball and especially baseball . He always claimed to have been a star pitcher at the semi-pro level , saying that he had difficulty choosing between golf and baseball . But there is no evidence , beyond his own self-promotion , that Hagen was major-league material . Still , when the teenage Hagen was n't playing golf , he was playing other sports . Sports did n't leave much time for the classroom . Hagen attended Allen 's Creek School , a one-room building located near Corbett 's Glen . As a 12-year-old , " when Mrs. Cullen , the teacher , was n't looking I jumped out the window and never went back to school regularly again . " But not finishing seventh grade seemed good enough for a kid of Hagen 's background ; he still had more education than his father or grandfather had completed . Besides , Hagen planned to make it big in baseball or golf . In case neither worked out , he took classes in auto repair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything I 'd learn to do would involve skill with my hands . I came from that kind of family , " he wrote . Hagen 's family also believed sports were fine youthful pastimes but saw them as illegitimate professions . His father wanted him to work as a skilled tradesman , like himself and previous generations of Hagens . Neither William nor Louise supported their son in golf , a conflict that continued through Hagen 's career . There is no evidence that Hagen 's mother ever saw him compete , and William did not attend a tournament until 1931 , when his famous son was well past his prime . Even after winning his first U.S. Open in 1914 , Hagen recalled , " Only my dad could see no future ahead for me . He considered knocking the little white ball around a pasture a silly way to make a living . Although I always thought the British tough people to convince , my dad was tougher . " Despite his parents " disapproval , Hagen took a final turn toward golf in 1912 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester . Within months , a few of the members encouraged Hagen to enter national tournaments and even paid his travel expenses . In 1913 , Hagen entered his first major competition , the U.S. Open at The Country Club . For the first 63 holes , Hagen played well enough to win . Instead , he finished in a tie for fourth , three shots out of the playoff between British stars Harry Vardon and Ted Ray and surprise champion Francis Ouimet . The following year , Hagen won the U.S. Open at Midlothian , outside Chicago . He went on to win 11 major championships , including another U.S. Open , four British Opens and five PGA Championships ( four straight from 1924 to 1927 ) . Hagen compiled most of his outstanding record after he left Rochester in 1918 to become the first pro at Oakland Hills , outside Detroit . Hagen admitted feeling at first " very homesick for Rochester and the huge trees and the meadows and the little brook that ran through Corbett 's Glen . Detroit was a long jump for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when I did , life in my new home city hit me big ! " It was only then that the legendary " Sir Walter " appeared . Henry Clune , a Rochester journalist who happened to move to Detroit around the same time as Hagen , believed the golfer experienced a metamorphosis after leaving his hometown : " Any hay that had been in Hagen 's hair in Rochester was brushed away ; any aspect of the yokel that may have been in evidence disappeared . Almost at once , he was invested in an aura of glamour and unshatterable aplomb on and off the golf course . " Ultimately , Hagen garnered far more fame and fortune than even he could have dreamed as a boy hacking balls around Corbett 's Glen . In retirement , he reflected on his youth and concluded , " I think I was lucky being born where and when I was .
