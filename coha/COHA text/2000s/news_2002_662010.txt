The bombing was so intense that it rattled windows in Khost , a town about 20 miles away . Civilians living near the bombing zone were fleeing and said that many people had been killed and wounded by bombs . <p> At the Pentagon , spokesman Rear Adm .

" <p> Left in place was a Clinton-era requirement that developers get a permit for any project involving more than a half-acre of wetlands . Until 2000 , developers had to get government approval only if more than three acres of wetlands were affected . <p> The new regulations also eliminate some restrictions on development in flood plains and revoke a prohibition on filling more than 300 linear feet along any stream . <p> Julie Sibbing , a wetlands expert for the National Wildlife Federation , said the new regulations will allow more wetland areas to be paved over .

The United States exported $165 billion in manufactured goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy indicated he would wait until at least until the end of March , when a WTO arbitrator is to report on the exact value of U.S. goods the EU would be entitled to impose the punitive tariffs on . <p> Lamy also said the EU remained open to " meaningful discussions " with the Bush administration to resolve the case , whose origins date back three decades . <p> ' Today ' celebrates 50th anniversary by looking back with clips , guests <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - On its Golden Anniversary broadcast , NBC 's " Today " reprised moments grand and goofy from its past 50 years . <p> And at least one live segment Monday morning will likely become part of any future retrospective : Katie Couric and the baby chimp . <p> A contemporary stand-in for J. Fred Muggs ( the popular " Today " chimpanzee in the 1950s ) , baby Jonah was very huggy with the " Today " host . Trouble is , his own Huggies had failed him , as alert viewers could see from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " laughed Couric , managing to return Jonah 's embrace while holding him a safe distance from her lavender suit . <p> The encounter summed up " Today " : grace under the pressure of delivering the world - even in the form of a sopping-wet monkey - each morning on live TV . <p> Along with the current team of Couric , Matt Lauer , Al Roker and Ann Curry , Monday 's edition of " Today " - roughly its 14,000th - also brought back alumni including Hugh Downs , Barbara Walters , Jim Hartz , Jane Pauley and " Nightly News " anchor Tom Brokaw , who confessed to having once overslept during his " Today " tenure . <p> " No one seemed to notice , " he said . " They started the show without me .

" So we sent a list to every Division I-A president and athletic director . If you 're doing your homework , you would research that list . " <p> Keith was joined at the news conference by representatives of the Minority Opportunities Athletics Association and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders said they were not satisfied with the results of the BCA 's effort to promote black coaches . <p> Willingham , who moved from Stanford to Notre Dame , was the only black coach hired . He was replaced at Stanford by former Florida assistant Buddy Teevens , who is white . <p> In addition , one other black coach - Louisiana-Lafayette 's Jerry Baldwin was fired after going 6-27 in three seasons . <p> That leaves only four black head coaches - Willingham , Michigan State 's Bobby Williams , San Jose State 's Fitz Hill and New Mexico 's Tony Samuel - among major college 's 115 programs . <p>
