Powered by a real estate boom , stocks of homebuilders are up 370% in four years . The good news ? They can go higher . by David Stires // When you think about sexy investments , chances are homebuilding stocks do n't jump to mind . At a time when companies are revolutionizing the way we interact through technology and developing miracle cures for previously unbeatable diseases , firms that construct homes with old-fashioned tools such as hammers and nails seem , well , dull . Unless you like making money . Big builders , as measured by the 14 stocks in Standard &; Poor 's supercomposite homebuilding index , have surged 370% in the past four years . It 's not as though they did well only as a defensive play during the bear market , either . Stocks of all stripes have rallied in the last year-the Dow is up 35% , the Nasdaq some 50% . Yet the builders are leading the way , rising 80% in the same period . The reasons for the surge will sound familiar to anyone who has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lowest levels in four decades , homeownership rose to its highest level ever last year , at 68% . The huge demand for homes has translated into record sales and profits for homebuilders . Can the run go on ? With rates expected to rise , bears say that the torrid pace of new-home sales will slow . Meanwhile , rising prices for land and lumber threaten to eat into profit margins . Some investors are concluding that the good times for homebuilders are ending . No doubt , a slowdown is on the horizon . The National Association of Home Builders projects that new-home sales will fall 3% in 2004 , to 1.05 million units . That 's based largely on the view that the Federal Reserve will raise the federal-funds interest rate later this year . Nevertheless , a slight uptick in rates is n't going to derail the housing boom . Population growth , in part fueled by immigration , will continue to drive demand for new homes . Plus , environmental restrictions , zoning regulations , and " not in my backyard " attitudes all contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to continue fueling much of the strong earnings growth . Twenty years ago , says Ken Heebner , manager of the CGM Realty fund , homebuilding was run by " mom-and-pop shops . " Today publicly traded builders control 20% of the market , up from 10% a decade ago . Heebner , whose fund has a five-year average return of 25% , expects their market share to rise to more than 50% over the next several years . Best of all , the stocks are still cheap . Value investor Ron Muhlenkamp first bought a half-dozen homebuilding stocks four years ago , when they traded for about four times earnings . They now sell for eight times earnings-and he still likes them . " If you brought us fresh money today , we 'd buy them , " he says . One strategy is to hedge against the possibility of rising rates by picking companies that focus on the luxury market ; buying decisions for their customers are less affected by lending rates . The nation 's leading seller of luxury homes is Toll Brothers ( TOL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat of rising rates is " more cocktail party talk " than a concern for his customers . And his confidence is backed up by the numbers . The company targets affluent baby-boomers by selling homes with an average price of more than $500,000 , twice the industry average . Toll Brothers has grown well beyond its Philadelphia roots and expanded into fast-growing markets in California , Arizona , Texas , and Florida by focusing on a clever but simple strategy : It builds near major cities and sells to " move up " buyers and empty-nesters with snazzy model homes that have a range of options . The stock trades for just eight times estimated earnings for fiscal 2005 . Another smart way to invest is to pick a consolidator , such as Lennar ( LEN , $53 ) . With annual sales of more than 30,000 homes in 13 states , it 's one of the biggest builders in the U.S. The company has expanded rapidly , particularly in the past few years . Led by the May 2000 acquisition of U.S. Home , Lennar has snapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's helped drive earnings per share up well over 30% a year during that period . The company also has one of the healthiest balance sheets in the industry . In its most recent fiscal year , Lennar reduced its debt-to-total-capital ratio to 32% , from 42% , and raised its cash on hand to $1.2 billion , from $730 million . These steps free up capital to make more acquisitions , something CEO Stuart Miller says he intends to pursue . Lennar too trades for just eight times earnings despite strong projected profit growth . Finally , there 's industry gorilla D.R. Norton ( DHI , $34 ) . Since its start in 1978 , the company has expanded from its Dallas-Fort Worth base into more than 20 states by making sound acquisitions . Following its recent purchase of Schuler Homes , D.R. Horton is now the largest company in the industry , with more than 37,000 homes sold in the past 12 months . Its increased girth gives it more leverage to negotiate favorable deals with suppliers and subcontractors . The company saved $2,600 per home in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prior period . The stock sells for nine times fiscal 2005 earnings projections . And given its huge $3.6 billion backlog , D.R. Horton has a solid foundation to build on .
