Chapter OneU.S . Marshal Marcus O'Malley tucked the cellular phone tighter against his shoulder as he studied the latest photographs sent by the North Washington district office . Eighteen faxes . The picture quality grainy at best ; the information about each individual sketchy . Each had made threats against judges attending this July conference at the Chicago Jefferson Renaissance Hotel . The pages crinkled as only cheap fax paper could as he thumbed through them , memorizing each one . " Kate , what are you not telling me ? " He was trying to have a telephone conversation with his sister while he worked and it was ... interesting . He would have said aggravating , but he loved Kate too much to get annoyed with her easily . His sister Kate O'Malley could be clear or ambiguous at will . As a hostage negotiator she knew how to choose her words , and she was being deliberately obtuse at the moment . It was 7:05 P.M. Friday night ; Supreme Court Justice Philip Roosevelt would give the keynote speech at 8:00 P.M. before an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to read between the lines . Kate was trying to tell him something without breaking a confidence ; that told him it was family related . And it was important enough she was willing to go to the edge of that confidence to let him know about it ; thattold him it was serious . " She was supposed to tell you last night ... " Marcus flipped back to the ninth fax and frowned . Something about the picture was triggering a glimmer of a memory . Tom Libour : Caucasian , early forties , clean shaven . It was an old memory , and he could feel it flitting just beyond his recall . He did n't forget cases he had worked . Maybe something his partner had worked ? He scrawled a note beside the photo , requesting the incident report be pulled . He passed the stack of faxes back to his deputy . " Who ? " Jennifer , Lisa , or Rachel ? In a family of seven , Kate had just cut the list in half . The seven of them were related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House-the decision to become their own family had made a lot of sense ; two decades later it still did . As the oldest , thirty-eight , he accepted the guardianship of the group ; as the next in line Kate protected it , kept her finger on the family pulse . He did n't mind the responsibility , but it often arrived at inconvenient times . What was going on ? " I 've said too much already ; forget I called . " " Kate- " " Marcus . " Her own frustration came back at him with the bite in her voice . " I did n't ask to be the one she chose to tell . I 'm stuck . I 'll push her to tell you ; it 's the best I can do . " The family was close , but Kate-she was the one he talked with in the middle of the night ; they had shared the dark days . They were the oldest , the closest , and there was no one he trusted more than her . " How serious is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of a folding chair . He would be standing behind the Supreme Court justice during the speech doing his best to look interested while he did his real job-decide who in the crowd might want to shoot the old man . " I 'm pacing the floors at night . " Marcus , reaching to straighten the lapel of his jacket , stopped . Kate had the nerve to walk into situations where a guy held a bomb ; the last thing she did was overreact . Something that had her that worried-his eyes narrowed . " Who , Kate ? " He could n't take the weight off her shoulders if he did n't know . If Kate had given her word , she would never say , but he could n't just leave it . He needed to know . " Can you get free later tonight ? " Time was tight . This was the biggest judicial conference of the year , but he was n't about to say no . Quinn would do him a favor .... " The banquet and its aftermath should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " We 'll join you even if I have to drag her there , " Kate replied grimly . " Deal . And even if it 's just you , come over . " " I 'll be there . Besides , it 's probably the only way I 'll get to see Dave . " Marcus spotted FBI Special Agent Dave Richman on the other side of the room , deep in a discussion with the hotel security chief . This conference had attracted explosive media attention . The Supreme Court was about to go conservative . With the announcement by the president of a nominee to replace retiring Justice Luke Blackwood , the landscape of the law across the nation would forever change . Most of the judges on the president 's short list were in attendance . Dave had drawn the unenviable job of trying to figure out how to control and manage the media access . " He 's here . Do you want to talk to him ? " Dave and Kate were dating . Dave having even gone so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was serious on her side too-Kate did n't let just anybody outside of the family get close to her heart . " No , I know you 're swamped . I just miss him . " She was in love . Everyone in the family knew that . Her face brightened when she saw Dave , and that impassive control she kept around her emotions , so necessary for her job , disappeared . Even her Southern accent intensified . Marcus kidded her about being love struck and she teased him back about hovering . That was okay ; she needed a big brother watching out for her . " Then you definitely need to come over tonight . I 'll tell Dave to expect you . " " Let me surprise him . Besides , knowing my job , I 'll probably get yanked by a page on my way over there . " She sounded irked , and he enjoyed that . " Love can be so rough . " " Just wait ; your turn is coming . " He was n't seeing anyone now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he did n't have time to notice anyone . His hands were full with his job and the O'Malley clan . But knowing Kate , she would probably try to set him up the first chance she got . She loved to meddle in his life , just like he did in hers . And he knew if she did he 'd have to grouse about it just for the principle of it , but he would n't really mind . There was never going to be time to date in his schedule ; it would simply have to be found . " Good-bye , Kate . I 'll see you later . " He closed the cellular phone and his amusement faded . What was wrong ? Jennifer O'Malley had just gotten engaged ; he did n't think it was her . That left Lisa or Rachel . Lisa was always getting into trouble with that curiosity of hers , but if he had to place a bet he would guess it was Rachel . She had been unusually quiet during the Fourth of July family gathering only days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem for the moment . He joined his partner Quinn . " Are we ready ? " " I think so . " Quinn looked like he had n't slept in the last couple days , but then he normally looked that way so it was hard to tell . Quinn had general hotel security : 37 floors , 1,012 rooms , and 50 meeting rooms to cover-it was like trying to plug a leaking dam with cotton balls . Unlike a federal court building where they could screen who entered or left the building , what they carried , this hotel was wide open to the public . " I got the hotel to agree to close delivery access to the kitchens for the evening ; it freed up another three men for ballroom security , " Quinn noted . " And I moved Deputy Ellis to Judge Blake . Ellis has covered the Fourth Circuit in the past , maybe he 'll be able to talk the judge into following basic security guidelines . " " Thanks . Nelson was showing the strain . " " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult of the judges on the president 's short list . " Quinn closed the folder of assignments and tossed it on the cluttered desk . Neatness had disappeared under the churn of numerous problems . " Do you think any of them have a chance of getting the nomination ? " To the U.S. Marshals , who knew the judicial personnel across the country better than the president who appointed them and the congress who confirmed them , a Supreme Court nomination was a race they handicapped with the skill of veteran court watchers . Marcus considered the names for a moment , then shook his head . " No . " The names on the list so far were good judges , but not the great ones . They were the political appeasement candidates , on the list until the scrutiny of the press gave the president something he could use as cover for not nominating them . The real candidates would be in the next set of names that surfaced . Marcus adjusted his jacket around the shoulder holster , checked the microphone at his cuff , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get himself mentally prepared for the long coming evening covering the justice . " I swear Deputy Nicholas Drake ate bad sushi for lunch on purpose . Tell me again how I got elected for this honor rather than you ? " he asked while he scanned the room , reviewing where they were at with a check of the status boards . As usual , they were having a conversation but their attention was on anything but each other . " You 're better looking . " Marcus grunted . " Sure . That 's why I get asked for your phone number . " His partner Quinn Diamond attracted attention without trying . The man looked like he had just stepped off his Montana ranch . There was something untamed about him and women seemed to know it . His face was weathered by the sun and wind , he could see to the horizon , and his gaze made suspects fidget . He called women ma'am and wore cowboy boots whenever he could get away with it . Marcus enjoyed having him as a partner ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protected witnesses , and kept each other alive . Quinn did n't flinch when the pressure hit . " Actually , Marcus-I 'm afraid I kind of blew it the other night , " Quinn admitted . Surprised at the sheepish tone of voice , Marcus glanced over at him . " How ? " " Lisa . " Quinn reached into his jacket pocket and took out a folded cloth . He flipped back the folded velvet to show a sealed petri dish . " She sent me a petrified squid . " It was so like his sister Lisa , Marcus had to laugh . " Sounds like a no to me , " he remarked dryly . Was this what Kate had stumbled into ? A tiff between Quinn and Lisa ? It did n't fit Kate 's reaction , but it was certainly an interesting development . " Where did she get this thing ? " " A forensic pathologist-I imagine that was one of the more tame replies she considered sending you . " " All I did was ask her out . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters . " Marcus took a moment to explain reality . " Two years ago you asked out Jennifer-she 's now engaged . Last year you asked out Kate-she 's now serious with an FBI agent . This year you asked out Lisa . You just told her she 's your third choice . Rachel might forgive you ; Lisa will never let you forget it . " " Can I help it if you 've got an interesting family ? " Even a friend like Quinn was n't going to be allowed to hurt his sister . " Flowers will not do ; you 'd better get creative with the apology . " " I 'm still going to get her to say yes . " " I wish you luck ; you 're going to need it . " Quinn would be good for Lisa . He was one of the few men Marcus thought would understand her and the trouble she got into because of her curiosity . Marcus was beginning to feel a bit like a matchmaker having just subtly pushed Kate and Dave together less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to free some time late tonight to meet with Kate . Swap the time with me and I 'll talk to Lisa for you . " " And tell her what ? " " Only your good points . " " Why do n't I believe you ? " Marcus grinned . " I 've already told her the bad . " The security net gave the five-minute warning to the start of the evening program . Judge Carl Whitmore would speak first , and then it would be his Honor Justice Roosevelt . Marcus would be glad when the evening was over . " Come on , Quinn , we need to talk to Dave about press access to Justice Roosevelt after the keynote speech . " " Please-give me crowd control ; anything but his Honor . I love the man , but he likes nothing better than to rile the media for the fun of it . " " He 's appointed for life ; his life is boring without controversy . " " You mean he 's too old to care if someone decides they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're going to owe me for this one . The last time his Honor held one of these media question and answer sessions , I had to expel a heckler and I ended up all over the evening news . " The Jefferson Hotel served chicken kiev , rice pilaf , and steamed asparagus for the main course at the banquet . Judge Carl Whitmore was too nervous to eat . He politely ate a few bites and moved food around on his plate before finally pushing his plate aside . Soon after the dinner plates were cleared away , the man beside him rose , moved to the podium , and gave a warm welcome to the guests . He began an introduction that Carl knew would take at most two minutes to give . Carl reached for the folder he had forced himself not to open during dinner . The introduction finished . Carl took a deep breath and rose to his feet . He shook hands with the man who had introduced him . Polite applause filled the room . He slipped off his watch and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pages of his speech from the folder and arranged them neatly to the left of center on the podium , and then took a final moment to slip on his reading glasses . Shari had written a note at the top of the first page with a bright pink felt tip pen-Remember to smile-and she had dotted the i in her name with a small heart . That fact , as much as her note , made Carl smile as he lifted his head , faced the bright lights , and smoothly began his prepared remarks to the twelve hundred guests in attendance . Bless her heart . What would he ever do without her ? Carl had been given such loyal friends . He had gone to law school with her father . Shari , her brother Joshua , and her parents William and Beth , had flown out from Virginia to be here for this speech . The hour of his greatest disappointment was also the hour he learned how rich his life really was . The president 's short list of judges had become known Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been early rumors that he was being considered , and those rumors had taken on substance when the FBI quietly began checking his background . Carl had begun to let himself hope . He was a bachelor , his life was the law , and to serve on the Supreme Court was his lifelong dream . His disappointment was intense . But in the audience were four people who understood , who shared his disappointment , and were determined to lift his spirits . He had been blessed in his friends . He had the important things in life . He began the speech he had waited his lifetime to give-a perspective of conservative thought in judicial law . The lights had partially dimmed as the speech began . Shari Hanford was grateful , for it helped hide the fact she had started to twirl her fork , reflecting her nervous energy . Even though she had not written this speech , she had worked on minor refinements and knew it word for word . Fifteen years in politics , the last ten of them as a speechwriter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech without holding her breath . She knew how important his was to Carl . If something she had suggested did n't work ... She gave up trying to hide the obvious and reached for a roll left in the basket on the table and tore it in two . Maybe it would settle her stomach . She regretted eating the chicken kiev ; she should have been smart like Carl and waited to order room service later . She would much rather be the one giving the speech . When she was at the podium , the nerves gave way to the process of connecting with the audience , adjusting the presentation : the inflections , the timing , the emphasis necessary to persuade people to her point of view . Her brother Joshua looked over at her and gave her a sympathetic smile . Normally he would be kidding her about her nerves , but not tonight . Carl began page two of his prepared text . His presentation had been flawless so far . Shari rested her elbow on the table , her chin against the knuckles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him , feeling his passion for the law come through in his words . She did n't understand why he was not on the Supreme Court short list . Someone at the Justice Department had really fumbled the ball in not recommending him . Lord , I still do n't understand why he was passed over . The quiet prayer was a running conversation that had been going on for days . It 's an enormous disappointment . Did n't the hours invested in prayer mean anything ? It 's not like I expect every prayer to be answered , but the big ones- ( Continues ... )
