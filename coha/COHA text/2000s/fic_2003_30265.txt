I Annunciation NOVEMBER 10-NOVEMBER 13 , 1999 The girl 's errand in the forest that day was to gather chanterelle mushrooms in a bucket to sell in town at dusk . According to her own account and the accounts of others in the North Fork Campground who would later be questioned by the diocesan committee , by Father Collins of Saint Joseph 's of North Fork , by the bishop 's representative , and by reporters covering the purported apparitions -- including tabloid journalists who treated the story like a visitation by Martians or the birth of a two-headed infant -- the girl left her camp before eight o'clock and walked alone into the woods . She wore a sweatshirt with its hood drawn tight . She did n't speak to others of her intentions . Setting out with no direction in mind , she crossed a maple bottom and a copse of alders , traversed a creek on a rotten log , then climbed a ridge into deep rain forest and began searching for mushrooms in earnest . As she went the girl ate potato chips and knelt beside rivulets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bay . Other than looking for mushrooms , she listened for the lonely music of birds and -- she confessed this later to Father Collins -- stopped twice to masturbate . It was a still day with no rain or fog and no wind stirring branches in the trees , the kind of stillness that stops time , or seems to , for a hiker . The girl paused often to consider it and to acknowledge her aloneness . She prayed the rosary on her knees -- it was Wednesday , November tenth , so she said the Glorious Mysteries -- before following an elk trail into country she had n't visited or perhaps did n't recall , a flat grown up with Douglas firs , choked by blowdowns and vine maple draped with witches ' - hair . Here she lay in a bed of moss and was seized by a dream that she lay in moss while a shape , a form -- a bird of prey , a luminous man -- bore down on her from above . Rising , she found chanterelles buried in the interstices of liverworts and in the shadows of windfalls . She cut them low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket . For a long time she picked steadily , moving farther into the woods , pleased because it was a rainless day on which she was finding enough mushrooms to justify being there . They drew her on like a spell . At noon she read from her pocket catechism , then prayed -- Give us this day our daily bread -- before crossing herself and eating more potato chips and a package of two chocolate donuts . Resting , she heard the note of a thrush , but muted , faint , and distant . Sunlight now filtered through the trees on an angle through the highest branches and she sought out a broad , strong shaft of it , stippled with boiling dust and litterfall , and lay on her back in its luminous warmth , her face turned toward heaven . Again she slept and again she dreamed , this time of a furtive woman in the trees , lit in darkness as though by a spotlight , who exhorted her to rise from the ground and continue her search for chanterelles . The girl got up and traveled on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two strange dreams disturbed her . Feeling a vague desire again , she put her hand between her legs , aimlessly , still walking . A cold or flu had hold of her , she thought . Her allergies and asthma seemed heightened too . Her period had started . The newspapers reported that her name was Ann Holmes , after her maternal grandmother , who died from sepsis and pneumonia a week before Ann was born . Ann and her mother , fifteen at Ann 's birth , had lived with Ann 's grandfather , a long-haul trucker , a man with complicated gambling debts , in a series of rental homes . The newspapers , though , did not uncover that her mother 's boyfriend , a methamphetamine addict , had raped Ann opportunistically beginning when she was fourteen . Afterward he would lie beside her with an expression of antic , contorted suffering etching his hairless long face . Sometimes he cried or apologized , but more often he threatened to kill her . When Ann was fifteen she took a driver 's education class , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to have an abortion . Eight months later she expelled her second fetus into the toilet at a minimart on the heels of a bout with nausea . On her sixteenth birthday she bought a two-door car , dented or crumpled in more than one panel , for three hundred and fifty dollars earned foraging for truffles and chanterelles . The next morning , she drove away . Ann was diminutive , sparrow-boned , and when she covered her head with her sweatshirt hood it was easy to mistake her for a boy of twelve , fair-skinned and dreamy . She often wheezed asthmatically , sneezed feebly , blew her nose , and coughed against her fist or palm . On most mornings her jeans were wet with the rain or dew transferred from the fronds of ferns and her hands looked pink and raw . She smelled of wood smoke , leaves and rank clothes and had lived for a month in the North Fork Campground in a canvas tent by the river . Others living there told reporters that she 'd rigged up a plastic tarp with twine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by firelight . Most described her as silent and subdued , though not unpleasant or inspiring unease , not threatening in her estrangement . Those who saw her in the woods that fall -- other mushroom gatherers , mostly , but also several elk and deer hunters and once a Stinson Company timber cruiser -- were struck by her inconsequence and by the wariness of her eyes in shadow underneath the drawn hood . A mushroom picker named Carolyn Greer who lived in a van in the North Fork Campground claimed that on an evening in mid-October she had eaten dinner with Ann Holmes , sharing soup , bread and canned peaches and speaking with her of present matters but never of themselves , their histories . Ann had not had much to say . Mostly she stirred her soup pot , listened , and stared at the flames of the fire . She did indicate a concern for her car , whose transmission no longer allowed her to shift gears or to travel anywhere . The car 's battery had petered out , and its windshield and windows appeared permanently clouded with an opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathering fallen cedar needles , both seats loaded with plastic bags , paper sacks , and cardboard boxes stuffed with her belongings . Carolyn did n't tell the bishop 's representative that while the soup was simmering they got high together . Primarily , it was nobody 's business . Furthermore , it implicated her too . Carolyn indulged in pot regularly . It surprised her that Ann , after a few tokes , did not become effusive and talkative , like most stoned people around a campfire . Instead she became even more reserved , more hermetic and taciturn . Her face disappeared inside the hood of her sweatshirt . She spoke when spoken to , terse but polite , and poked incessantly at the wood coals . Her only subject was her dead car . Stranded , Ann had resorted to the county bus , which stopped at a convenience store a half mile from the campground and dropped her in front of the MarketTime in North Fork for eighty-five cents , one way . She paid , the county driver reported , with exact change , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Once he commented on the mushrooms in her bucket , on their number , size , and golden hue , and she gave him some loosely wrapped in newspaper she found at the back of the bus . On the highway , she slept with her head against the window . Frequently she read from a paperback book he eventually discerned was a catechism . When she got off in town she said thank you or good-bye , her hood still drawn around her face . A half dozen times she accepted a ride from a mushroom and brush picker named Steven Mossberger , who wore a dense beard , Coke-bottle glasses , and a wool cap pulled low on his temples . Seeing her carrying her bucket of chanterelles and walking the road one afternoon , Mossberger rolled down the window of his pick-up , explained that he lived in the campground as she did , that he picked mushrooms just like her , then asked if she wanted a lift . Ann refused him without affront . No , thanks , she said . I 'm okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , he pulled over at dusk in a modest rain and she accepted without hesitating . When he leaned across to push ajar the door , she got in smelling of wet clothes and mushrooms , set the bucket of chanterelles on her lap , and said , It 's a little wet out . Where are you from ? Mossberger asked . Down in Oregon . Not far from the coast . What 's your name ? She gave him her first . He told her his full name . He put his hand out to shake hers and she slipped her hand into his . He wanted to believe , afterward , that this moment was freighted with spiritual meaning , that in taking her hand he felt the hand of God , and he described it that way to the diocesan committee and to the bishop 's representative -- a hand that was more than other hands , he said , connecting him with something deeper than his own life -- but in fact , he understood privately , what he felt was probably little more than the small thrill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Fork , Ann sold her mushrooms to Bob Frame , a mechanic who worked on logging equipment and ran his mushroom business on the side . Garrulous and jocular most of the time , he spoke with an instinctive brevity and disdain to the first journalist who entreated him . The girl 's mushrooms , Frame said , were always meticulously field cleaned , and her bucket contained few culls . Only once , on an evening of bitter rain , did she drink the coffee he kept about as a gratuity for his pickers . For a few minutes she sat by the electric heater , sipping from a Styrofoam cup , watching as he layered mushrooms in newspaper and weighed the day 's take on a scale . It seemed to him , working close to her , that she had n't bathed or laundered her clothing in a long time , maybe weeks . He did recall that she kept her pay in a leather pouch worn around her neck , not in the pocket of her jeans . Her shoes , he noted , were well-worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper so that her damp wool sock showed through . Even in his shed she wore her sweatshirt hood and kept her hands in her sweatshirt pockets . Frame did n't tell the journalist that she could give no social security number when he requested one for his records . He 'd paid her cash and noted nothing in his books of recompense made to an Ann Holmes , and because of that small worrisome omission he was angry with himself for having said anything about Ann Holmes at all . He spoke to no more journalists afterward and proclaimed in town that the media circus perpetually surrounding the visionary was a spectacle he could n't participate in and still live with himself . In truth it was the specter of an IRS audit that made him afraid to speak of her , though he did tell his wife , swearing her to secrecy , that once when the girl freed her pouch from her sweatshirt she also inadvertently brought forth a necklace bearing a crucifix , which Bob said glowed a brilliant gold . From Frame 's shed Ann carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . One checker recalled her proclivity for sugar wafers , small cartons of chocolate milk , deli burritos , and Starbursts . No one else remembered very much , except that she always wore her hood and counted her returned change . She asked for the key to the storeroom toilet more often than other customers and used the dish soap in the utility sink to wash her hands afterward . Occasionally she stuffed pennies in the cans for the Injured Loggers ' Fund . In early November , while foraging for chanterelles , two girls from North Fork came across Ann Holmes in the woods east of town . They were middle-school girls , seventh graders , who had employed the ruse of mushrooming all fall to smoke pot in the woods after school . Besides their mushroom buckets and pocketknives , they brought along a bag of marijuana , a small pipe , and matches . Deeply concerned about getting caught , careful girls who giggled for long stretches after smoking even a little pot , they were mindful of the need for chewing gum , eyedrops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paranoid , and startled by noises in the forest . The singing of a bird could worry them . A plane overhead , a truck on a distant road , froze them in their tracks , wide-eyed . They 'd been stoned that afternoon for a half hour and were finding mushrooms here and there , giggling together in their usual manner , when they saw Ann Holmes perched on a log , watching them with her hands in her pockets and her sweatshirt hood drawn around her cheeks so that her face lay in shadow . At first they thought she was a boy of their own age , an unfamiliar boy not from their town , and even when they came close enough to see that her bucket was brimming with chanterelles , neither was certain that she was n't a boy , though they inspected her face closely . Both were conscious of being stoned and wondered if it was observable somehow , if their behavior gave them away . They exerted themselves to act normal . Whoa , said one . You scored . I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you ever noticed that bucket rhymes with fuck it ? Crystal . Excuse me . God , Crystal . I 'm sure . It rhymes . God , Crystal . I 'm sure . They giggled now in a truncated manner , trying to stop themselves . They both put hands over their mouths in an effort to hold in laughter . Ann loosened her sweatshirt drawstring , pushed the hood away from her face , and ran her fingers through her hair . Her hair was short , the color of old straw , matted to her head , unkempt . The others could see now that Ann was a girl , which was not as good as a strange boy in the woods to talk about at school . Are you like from where ? one asked . I 'm from the campground . You were like born there ? They laughed again , covering their mouths . One of them nearly fell over . You guys are baked , Ann said . We 're not baked we 're totally hammered . I 'm like fried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sat cross-legged on the forest floor . The one named Crystal pulled out a deck of cards . The other produced the bag of marijuana . Let 's get baked , she suggested . Maybe a little , Ann replied . They smoked dope , played Crazy Eights , ate a rope of red licorice , some Dots and a box of Red Hots . Ann asked if they believed in Jesus . Uh oh , said one . Are you a Jesus freak ? From the Hardcover edition .
