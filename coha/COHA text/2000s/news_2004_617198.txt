<p> Santa Monica , Calif.  --  <p> Now that the airlines have been stumbling over each other with their $99 one-way fares to Los Angeles , the previously unthinkable prospect of a family vacation on the Left Coast is a reality . <p> You can pack up your children in their blue sunblock and their inflatable duck life preservers , hop in a plane and emerge five hours later a little the worse for wear but ready to explore a whole new world . <p> You will , of course , take the kids to Disneyland , Knott 's Berry Farm or Universal Studios . Those are the necessary evils of traveling with children and I 'm not here to tell you about any of that . ( I did my time in Disneyland . ) I 'm here to tell you the place you 'll want to stay , which is Santa Monica . <p> Beach . Pier . Rides . Bike paths . Museums . Pedestrian-friendly streets . Easy access to sights . Inexpensive hotels with pools and kitchenettes . This 8-square-mile city makes Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have just one caveat . Beware of the evil meter maid . <p> She caught us , as soon as we emerged from a harrowing freeway journey and pulled in front of our hotel . I hopped out of the car and left it running with my family inside while I talked to the desk clerk . I returned about 30 seconds later to find my wife and the meter maid locked in girl-girl combat . My wife was berating the meter maid and trying to pull the pad from her hands . The meter maid was stoically not saying a word . In the end it did n't matter that we were n't parked . We still got a $38 parking ticket . <p> Despite that welcome , everything about our stay in Santa Monica went swimmingly . Here 's what we did : <p> * Rented a suite at the Cal Mar Hotel : This former apartment house seems like it sprang fully formed from David Lynch 's imagination . The suites open into a large atrium pool filled with warm saltwater and surrounded by looming and vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckled and warped , but immaculately clean thanks to a omnipresent squadron of blue-uniformed maids . <p> The suites themselves have a private bedroom with its own TV , a full kitchen , a dining room and fold-out couch in the living room that the maids make and unmake each day . They also do dishes , find appropriate vases for flowers and tuck dolls and teddy bears into kids ' beds . There are plenty of shady tables by the pool , and the various families here make fast friends over morning coffee and bagels . <p> It 's also a block from the Third Street Promenade . <p> * Walked the promenade : It consists of three car-free blocks of familiar chain stores and overpriced restaurants . But the reason to go is because the daily busker scene is perfectly wild . Every day is a feast of free entertainment . We saw tango dancers , a man who got a woman from the audience to spin three basketballs on her appendages as he made rude jokes about her , and a guy who played ' 60s spy-movie music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pier : The 100-year-old Santa Monica Pier is more than a place to get soft ice cream cones , buy pukka-shell necklaces and play skee ball , though it is at first glance just that . Once you 're done with the honky-tonk pleasures and , perhaps , have taken a spin on the solar-powered Ferris wheel and the bumper cars , you can explore what 's under the pier . The Santa Monica Pier Aquarium and UCLA Ocean Discovery Center offer hands-on presentations of marine life and touch tanks that allow you to handle endangered sea specimens . <p> * Went biking : Right across from the aquarium are places to rent bikes and in-line skates . You can even get one of those little covered kid-carriers to hitch on the back of your bike . The two-mile waterfront path to Venice Beach takes you through a fast-changing landscape of pedestrian walkways , empty beaches , makeshift movie sets and the infamous Muscle Beach , where men flex their assets on open-air gym equipment . <p> We stopped to look at the religious icons , candles , vinyl records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also all had our tarot cards and palms read by a middle-aged man who had a gray goatee and a twinkle in his eye that entranced the kids . He gave them kid-friendly readings and told me that I 'd have a screenplay optioned . ( Better get writing . . . ) <p> * Woke up early for the farmers market : The Santa Monica markets are considered the best in the area and , by extension , the country . The downtown market ( which , sadly , was the place where that aging motorist lost control of his car a few months ago ) happens twice weekly , at 9 a.m. -2 p.m . Wednesdays and 8:30 a.m. -2 p.m . Saturdays , on Arizona Street between Second and Third streets , and covers several blocks . ( Two other markets are at the Santa Monica Airport on Saturdays and Main Street and Heritage Square on Sundays . ) <p> Gorgeous artichokes still on their foot-long stems , strawberries that taste like strawberries , Gouda cheeses in a panoply of flavors , heirloom varieties of arugula and fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadlocked man with a mellifluous voice enchants you into buying lavender . And Jerry tells you to always buy Jerry 's berries . Or was it Harry 's berries ? <p> * Stuffed our faces : Santa Monica is home to many of the most famous restaurants in greater L.A. : Michael 's , one of the temples of California cuisine of the early 1980s ; Chinois on Main , a strategic outpost in Wolfgang Puck 's empire ; Melisse , the hottest new highbrow French in the city , and many others . <p> With kids in tow , the biggest name we ventured was Border Grill  --  the fun Mexican spot run by Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger ( the " Two Hot Tamales " of TV fame ) . A green corn tamale with sour cream and an adobo pork chop served with apple tamarind sauce and chile dulce were both easygoing and fun to eat but also cannily seasoned . <p> * Drove to Hollywood by surface streets : Imagine that . You 're in a part of L.A. where you can eschew the freeways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , West Hollywood and Hollywood for our **27;6675;TOOLONG tour . <p> We took Sunset Boulevard on the way back , going by way of Pacific Palisades and Malibu . It was dusk as we were in the car , and from the high , windy road we had a great view of the sun disappearing into the Pacific . Aha ! Sunset Boulevard ( duh ) . <p> * Went to the Getty Center : This spectacular museum and research center set high in the hills is an easy shot from Santa Monica . My kids appreciated the tram ride up from the parking lot and the children 's center , where there were several activities involving computers , costumes and art supplies . <p> What the kids seemed to like best was the trickling stream of water that started high on the plaza and fell down through various falls , stages and embankments until it circled through the maze-like garden . They still talk about it  --  almost as much as Disneyland . <p> After the trip was over , I sent in a check for the parking ticket but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash it . I figured someone in charge of the People 's Republic of Santa Monica would listen to reason . They sent a very civilized letter back . <p> And cashed the check .
