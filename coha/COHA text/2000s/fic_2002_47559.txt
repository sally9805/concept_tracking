IN LLOYD 'S TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR , he became clumsy . He 'd just made Level III Manager , and they 'd bought their first house , a Queen Anne in a safe neighborhood with good schools . First , he shattered the smoke detector while swatting a gypsy moth with the broom . Then , stripping wallpaper with a putty knife , he pushed too hard and gouged the plaster , revealing the dark , tender underskin . It surprised his wife , because she had always been the one to chip glasses , nick her underarm with a Lady Bic , back over the mailbox . Now , as the spackle hardened in the dining room , he frowned as he over-snipped the conical shrub by the rose trellis . Later he fell off the roof . <p> Because his family had a history of brain tumors , Molly took him to a specialist , a Dr. Moss , who never stopped talking-how little we know of the brain , its mysteries , machinations , its dark convolutions . " For instance , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly clenched Lloyd 's fingers . <p> " Outta nowhere , " Dr. Moss said , " he starts getting hairy . In his ears , on his back , even his palms . Understand , this was a guy who 'd had trouble growing a mustache . But now he has a five o'clock shadow by noon . " <p> " What was it ? " Lloyd asked . " A tumor ? " <p> " Of course it was . It 's always a tumor . " <p> " What about Lloyd ? " Molly asked . <p> " You ? " Moss angled his computer screen toward them . " You got nothing . " <p> That night , in quiet celebration , a wardrobe box for a table , Lloyd spilled his champagne on Molly 's late grandmother 's just-unrolled Turkish carpet . <p> " Maybe it 's this , " Molly said . " Maybe , subconsciously- " <p> " You 're going to tell me I do n't really want the house , so I 'm being passive-aggressive . " <p> " I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In years to come he broke windows , mirrors , ships in bottles , their daughter 's kitten 's spine , an antique crystal chandelier , a church pew , the binding of a first-edition Alice in Wonderland , the lid of a piano . He broke a blunderbuss at a silent auction . He broke tennis racquets , fishing rods , luggage , a globe , his collarbone , an MRI machine . <p> Certainly there were moments where he was n't clumsy , but these were not the moments he remembered . What he remembered was the skein of accidents , the stubs , the stumbles , the small explosions , the near misses , all of them exhilarating . <p> If , in the Far East on business , he tried to conjure Molly , her round face surfaced with a look of perpetual alarm , her voice a shrill yelp of warning . She never adjusted to his mishaps , as she called them , questioning his finger , for instance , which had slipped and forwarded the wrong e-mail to the wrong people , costing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , he 'd broken thirteen briefcases , twenty-one pairs of eyeglasses , fifty-nine umbrellas , and occasionally the heart of Molly , who never learned to embrace the uncertainty . <p> Lloyd did , and grew to see his clumsiness as a kind of gift . To take a thing and use it showed failure of imagination . He took a thing and read its fault lines , knew five ways it would break for him . When his great-grandchildren visited , they came gravely to his wheelchair , and when they left there were two toys in their hands where there had been one . He had blessed them . By now Dr. Moss had died , and Molly had died , and two of their children and even one of their grandsons . But Lloyd , Lloyd was n't tired . How could he let his trembling hands fall empty to his sides ? How could he leave the world before it was broken ? <p> Author Affiliation                    @
