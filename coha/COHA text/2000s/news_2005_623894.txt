<p> Perhaps the same old bars seem tired , or a restaurant too much of a commitment  --  a fresher option for getting together with friends to toast the holidays or recover from shopping is stopping into a wine bar . <p> More than a half-dozen wine bars have opened around the Bay Area during the past year , and a handful more are scheduled to open in the next few months , ranging from Ottimista Enoteca-Cafe in San Francisco to 154 Wine Bar in Petaluma . <p> Wine bars offer a way to unwind in a more low-key , relaxing atmosphere than a typical bar . Plus , many of them offer nibbles , bites or small plates to go with that glass . At the very least , you 'll be able to snack on cheese and nuts , dried fruits and pickles , and a small selection of charcuterie or pates , some homemade . <p> Some wine bars , such as Cork in Sausalito , go one step further with finger sandwiches , delicate crostini and crisp-edged panini . It 's similar to high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine bars , such as Satur in Santa Rosa , and Cav and Nectar , both in San Francisco , serve the kind of small plates that can wind up as a full meal . They 're also generally noisier . <p> Here 's a sampling of what some of the new wine bars have to offer . . <p> Hotel Biron . Quiet and intimate , this Civic Center gem is tucked into the dingy alley behind San Francisco 's Zuni Cafe and marked simply with a " B " above the door . It could easily be a Parisian speakeasy , with its dim glow on copper tables , bistro chairs and a leather sofa . The venue also serves as space for emerging artists , so the decor changes with fresh paintings or photographs . <p> The wine list is divided by country rather than varietal and offers interesting selections by the glass , such as Arca Nova Vinho Verde ( $7 ) , a very green Portuguese wine and an alternative to Champagne . Oenophiles can geek out on d'Arenberg Grenache ( $11 ) from Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very helpful and have good knowledge of the wine . <p> Order one of the tasting plates at the counter , such as select cheeses ( $5 each ) and Fatted Calf charcuterie ( $5 ) . For sweets , there are fruits , nuts and quince paste ( $2 each ) to round out the list . . <p> Bacchus Wine Bar . This Marina venue is equally intimate , but a window looks out on San Francisco 's street scene . It 's more like a swank hotel bar , without the hotel , and there are just 20 seats . Despite its small size , Bacchus features a long wine list that also includes sake and sake cocktails . <p> There are wines by the glass , but the bottle list , which includes a little-seen Lebanese winery , is more interesting , so it 's a good place to persuade a friend or two to split a bottle . A frequently changing cheese plate ( $15 ) can tide diners over as they wait for a table at one of the many busy restaurants on Steiner Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shopping around San Francisco 's Ferry Plaza Marketplace and the crowd gets to be too much , pop into this wine store that doubles as a wine bar . <p> The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the wines , whether you buy them there to take home , or would like to select one to drink at the bar . The selection is immense and revolving , so if you 'd rather leave it in their hands , just choose one of the daily glasses , and order a cheese plate ( $15 ) , pates ( $11 ) , salumi ( $7 ) or nuts ( $5 ) . <p> The food comes out on tiered trays , and the staff does n't rush customers to leave . If you do choose a wine from the store , the staff will open it with a $6 corkage fee . <p> The Wine Merchant also offers chocolates by Ferry Plaza neighbor Michael Recchiuti . . <p> Cork . You can get a more substantial bite at this 5-month-old wine bar in Sausalito . It 's slightly off the main drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , or outdoor eating on the back patio . There , halved wine barrels act as tables for the wooden park-like benches , a pleasant place to nibble on English pea crostini ( $5 ) with a glass of Prosecco Fantinel ( $7 ) . <p> The nibbles  --  crostini , panini , salads and small bites  --  do n't come with wine recommendations , but the servers are happy to play around . <p> The Albarino Lagar de Cervera ( $9 ) , a Spanish white chosen by our server , paired beautifully with a fresh Brussels sprout salad ( $8 )  --  a hard match with its lemon dressing . Other dishes , like dainty tea sandwiches with cucumber and mascarpone ( $5 ) and lush prosciutto-wrapped figs ( $10 ) , seemed like they would work with a wide variety of wines . . <p> Nectar Wine Lounge . Opened last year , Nectar is part restaurant , part wine bar , and is frequently packed on weekends . <p> A long bar separates the lounge area in the front with just a few tables in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates are small  --  come with wine pairing selections . <p> Some , like the quail ( $14 ) with barley and sausage stuffing paired with a 2001 Castello di Bossi Chianti Classico ( $11 ) , worked . Others , like the ahi tartare ( $12 ) with hummus , tomato and jalapeno gastrique , did n't , with too many competing flavors for the 2003 Karl Lagler Gruner Veltliner ( $13 ) . <p> The full table service becomes haggard when busy . It 's much better as a pre-dinner or light-bite place , but it 's really the wine list that shines . <p> Flights are fun  --  an all-Spanish Iberian flight ( $12 ) , full-bodied Bad-Assed Red flight ( $15 ) or a Bubbles flight ( $13 )  --  offer interesting tastes of wines with a good comparative basis . The bubbles flight included a 2000 Gruet Blanc de Blanc from New Mexico that was quite acidic on its own , but worked well to cut through the crisp fried mussels ( $8 ) with spicy sriracha remoulade . <p> But even if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available by the glass , or taste ( $3-$7.50 )  --  something that is not seen on many other wine bar menus . . <p> Cav . This more casual wine bar , newly opened on Market Street in San Francisco , also offers small plates , although here they 're a bit lustier  --  and larger . <p> There are no wine-pairing suggestions , but servers can offer interesting choices , including a Croatian Malvazija ( $8 ) that was crisp and clean tasting and worked nicely with the gorgeous fritto misto made up of expertly fried , paper-thin Meyer lemon slices and cardoons ( $6 ) , and the zippy hamachi crudo ( $14 ) . <p> A Ross Estate Old Vine Grenache ( $8.50 ) worked with the game hen with preserved lemon , fennel and mint ( $9 small/$18 large ) . <p> A plate of cookies was a nice end to this meal , although the modern decor and slightly stiff chairs are n't conducive to sitting too long . Still , Cav , like any of these new wine bars , can do the trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These wine bars also offer food , whether it is nibbles or small plates . <p> Bacchus Wine Bar : 1954 Hyde St. ( at Union ) , San Francisco ; ( 415 ) 928-2633. 5:30-2 a.m. nightly .
