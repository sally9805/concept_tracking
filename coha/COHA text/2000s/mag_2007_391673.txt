To the regulars around Guilford Street in Baltimore , where many of the city 's less fortunate congregate , the woman who started hanging around recently seemed out of place .

" You could tell she was different , " Indeed , noticing the unfamiliar face , a woman who works in the area approached the stranger and found out her name : Katie . An Internet search of missing persons took her to the Web site of Rob Corcoran , whose wife Katie , 35 , who suffers from severe mental illness , had checked out of a psychiatric hospital on Sept. 5 and gone missing .

' ' " With that simple reply , the family 's nine-week ordeal of worry over her fate ended in relief . From the antiques-filled farmhouse in Lincoln , R.I. , that he shared with Katie , a stay-at-home mom , and their two children , Rob , 37 , had mounted a massive search effort for his wife , who he says was diagnosed with a postpartum " delusional disorder . " Teams of volunteers searched soup kitchens and shelters throughout the northeast . " It 's just awful to have a child you bring into the world and not know if they are safe or alive , " says her mother Nancy Newell . " That 's devastating .

In the following weeks there were several sightings of her , including Newport and New York City . It is unclear how she got to Baltimore or how she was getting by , but she appeared to be physically okay and was asking about her kids . As for the good Samaritan in Baltimore , who insisted on remaining anonymous , she and a friend refused the $50,000 reward Rob Corcoran 's company had raised , preferring that the money go to Katie 's treatment .
