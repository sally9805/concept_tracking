Geologic evidence for liquid water on ancient Earth and Mars seems to contradict standard solar models , which suggests that the young Sun was much less luminous than today . <p> Imagine a young Sun  --  some four billion years in the past  --  that is much fainter and cooler than today 's mature Sun . So much less luminous is this young Sun that Earth and Mars are frigid . It remains far too cold on either planet for liquid water to exist . Both planets are locked in a so-called icehouse state for nearly the first half of their history . <p> Such is the picture suggested by standard models of stellar evolution : as a star ages on the main sequence , its luminosity increases . This increase results from changes in the chemical composition of the star 's core due to thermonuclear reactions that turn hydrogen into helium and liberate energy . In fact , the standard model predicts that the Sun 's luminosity has increased by some thirty per cent over the last 4.5 billion years . <p> As a result of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been some 25 C lower than today . Such a low temperature should have kept large parts of Earth frozen until about one to two billion years ago . The case for Mars is even more extreme due to its greater distance from the Sun . Yet there is compelling geologic evidence suggesting that liquid water was abundant on both planets three to four billion years ago . <p> Earth 's oldest rocks , which are found in northern Canada and in the southwestern part of Greenland , date back nearly four billion years to the early Archean eon . Within these ancient rock samples are rounded " pebbles " that appear to be sedimentary  --  laid down in a liquid-water environment . Rocks as old as 3.2 billion years exhibit mud cracks , ripple marks , and microfossil algae . All of these pieces of evidence indicate that early Earth must have had an abundant supply of liquid water in the form of lakes or oceans . <p> Mars also exhibits abundant evidence for liquid water in its ancient past . It has networks of dry channels and valleys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flow of liquid water . Sediments deposited within the canyons suggest the presence of standing lakes in the past . And some features appear to have resulted from the former action of large glaciers that have since disappeared . <p> This apparent contradiction  --  between the icehouse that one would expect based upon stellar evolution models and the geologic evidence for copious amounts of liquid water  --  has become known as the " faint young sun paradox . " It was first pointed out more than three decades ago by Carl Sagan and George Mullen . Does the paradox indicate a problem with our stellar evolution models ? Or is there another way around this conundrum ? The " Greenhouse Gas " Solution <p> For almost thirty years , the conventional solution to the paradox has been to assume a large greenhouse-gas effect . In this scenario , so-called greenhouse gases in the atmospheres of Earth and Mars are transparent to visible and near-infrared sunlight . The sunlight is absorbed by the planet 's surface , and the surface re-radiates energy in the mid-infrared . The key , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trapped mid-infrared radiation from the surface results in a rising atmospheric temperature . <p> At some point , an energy balance must be reached : when the temperature of the planetary surface is such that the energy carried out by mid-infrared photons equals that carried in by the visible and near infrared solar photons , the surface temperature will stop rising . Of course , the greater the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , the higher this equilibrium temperature . That is why there is such interest and concern in studying and controlling the human production of greenhouse gases ! <p> Applying this general mechanism to young planets , one comes to the hypothesis that the greenhouse effect on each young planet was sufficient to counter the lower energy flux from the young Sun , allowing liquid water to exist in large quantities . But the existence of what kinds of greenhouse gases was even possible on the young planets ? Carbon dioxide , a major culprit of global warming today , was one of the first suspects in this mystery . <p> Atmospheric carbon dioxide has been decreasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of microorganisms that trap carbon dioxide in soils . In order to counteract the lower luminosity of the faint young Sun , carbon dioxide levels in the Archean must have been about one thousand times greater than those of the present day . Weathered soils  --  or paleosols as the geologists call them  --  that are preserved through burial and hardening ( i.e. , without much alteration ) can be used to determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere at the time the weathering occurred . Studies by various research groups indicate that , while the carbon dioxide concentration was indeed much higher during the Archean eon , it falls well below the amount required to counter the faint Sun 's effect on Earth . As for Mars , which would require an even more massive carbon dioxide greenhouse effect due to its greater distance , carbonates have yet to be found in sufficient quantities . <p> Early on there were suspicions that the Archean carbon dioxide concentration was insufficient to counter the faint Sun . In a 1972 article in Nature , Carl Sagan and George Mullen proposed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million  --  acted as a greenhouse gas , warming the surfaces of both planets to temperatures well above freezing . However , it was determined soon after the article appeared that atmospheric ammonia would very quickly and irreversibly be destroyed by incoming solar ultraviolet photons . Other scientists suggested methane , but it turns out that it , too , would be rapidly destroyed by solar radiation . ( In 1997 , Christopher Chyba , of the SETI Institute and Stanford University , and , posthumously , Carl Sagan proposed that high-altitude organic solids produced by the photochemical destruction of methane might have acted as a shield against the destruction of lower altitude ammonia by solar ultraviolet radiation , but many of the input parameters in their model are unknown . ) The Bright Young Sun Solution <p> Early in the 1990s it was posited that perhaps the young Sun was bright instead of faint . If the young Sun were slightly more massive than the present Sun , it would have been hotter and brighter than predicted by the standard solar model . Of course , this requires that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But is such a thing reasonable ? <p> Mass loss does , indeed , occur throughout the main sequence lifetime of a star . The Sun currently experiences mass loss via the solar wind at a rate of 3 x 10- 14 solar masses per year . If this rate has been steady over the last four and a half billion years , the Sun 's mass would have been one ten thousandth of a solar mass greater when the star was an infant . But this additional mass , and the concomitant higher luminosity , is still much too low to account for the warm climates on young Earth , let alone young Mars . <p> Yet there is evidence that the Sun 's mass-loss rate was higher in the past . Measurements of noble gases in samples of surface material returned from the Moon suggest that the solar wind was roughly an order of magnitude larger over the past three billion years . And irradiated meteorite grains are telltales that solar-flare activity was about a thousand times greater during the first billion or so years of the Sun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar wind would likely have been a thousand times greater as well . If that is the case , the Sun may have lost about three per cent of its mass over its history  --  and that three per cent higher initial mass would have resulted in a significantly higher luminosity for the young Sun . <p> Another long-standing problem is also solved if the Sun has lost a significant fraction of its mass over the past 4.5 billion years . The Sun and similar stars exhibit abnormally low photospheric abundances of the element lithium . Study of an alternative to the standard solar model indicates that a mass loss of five to ten per cent over the course of the Sun 's main-sequence lifetime may explain this lithium depletion . In addition , this model also sets an upper limit of 1.1 solar masses for the young Sun . <p> Observations of young , Sun-like stars should ultimately help astronomers understand and constrain mass loss in the young Sun . Some progress has already been made . Eric Gaidos ( University of Hawai'i at Minoa ) , Manuel Gdel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake ( Caltech ) used the Very Large Array to make radio observations of mass loss in three nearby young , Sun-like stars . They found a mass-loss rate for these stars can be no larger than about 1000 times the Sun 's current mass-loss rate . The group used these results to constrain mass loss in stars like the Sun : at most , our Sun may have lost six per cent of its initial mass over the last 4.5 billion years . <p> More recently , Brian Wood ( University of Colorado ) and colleagues made x-ray observations of mass loss in nine G- and K-type main-sequences stars . Their studies suggest that stars like the Sun experience higher mass-loss rates in the first few billion years of life , but , again , the mass loss experienced by the Sun is on the order of a few per cent . They estimate that the Sun may have lost somewhere between one and five per cent of its initial mass . Further constraints may come from higher precision helioseismology because early mass loss on the order of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interior structure . And those imprints may be manifest in simulations of solar evolution as a function of time . <p> I. Juliana Sackmann ( Caltech ) and Arnold Boothroyd ( University of Toronto ) used high precision solar-evolution models that included early-main-sequence mass loss . The scientists ' goal was to estimate what initial solar mass could solve the paradox on both Earth and Mars . They tested initial masses ranging from 1.01 to 1.07 solar masses and considered several mass-loss scenarios for each mass . They found that if the solar mass were 1.07 times the current mass , the solar flux would have been five per cent greater than the current value  --  instead of the thirty per cent lower value as predicted by the standard models ! This higher flux is a combined effect of the greater solar luminosity and the fact that the planets would have been closer to the more massive young Sun . <p> A more massive , bright young Sun is appealing because it solves the paradox for both Earth and Mars without the need to invoke a massive carbon-dioxide greenhouse effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , current observations suggest that the mass loss experienced by the Sun may be less than the seven per cent or so required to explain liquid water on both Earth and Mars . On the other hand , the sample of mass-losing stars observed to date is small , and most are over a billion years old . Observations of mass-loss rates of more very young stars are of paramount importance . The Cosmic-Ray Solution <p> Although far less certain than the link between solar activity and Earth 's climate , cosmic rays may influence climate on Earth . The general idea is that the high-energy cosmic rays penetrating Earth 's atmosphere lead to higher ionization rates , which makes cloud formation easier . It is speculated that increased cloud cover leads to cooler surface temperatures , and extended periods of heavy cloud cover may have lead to ice-age epochs on Earth . <p> The cosmic-ray flux experienced by Earth is recorded in iron meteorites discovered scattered about the planet . This record indicates that Earth has experienced four large-scale cycles of cosmic-ray flux over the past half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astrophysical Journal , Douglas Gies , of Georgia State University , and high-school student John Helsel presented calculations that suggest these cycles are correlated with our Sun 's journey around the center of the Galaxy : spiral-arm crossings are associated with higher cosmic-ray exposures . These spiral-arm passages appear to coincide with extended periods of very cool climate on Earth  --  so-called icehouse periods . <p> Nir Shaviv , of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , has suggested that modulation of the cosmic-ray flux by the young Surfs solar wind may have played a role in warming both young Earth and Mars . This stronger solar wind resulted from a faster rotation rate , which gave rise to a stronger solar magnetic dynamo . This , in turn , meant more solar activity and a stronger solar wind . ( Nearly a decade ago , Manuel Gdel and colleagues reported that solar-type , zero-age main-sequence stars rotate over ten times faster than the Sun . ) <p> A stronger solar wind would have effectively lowered the Galactic cosmic-ray flux reaching the inner Solar System . Both Earth and Mars would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less cloud formation . The result was higher temperatures on both planets . Shaviv 's calculations indicate that cosmic rays may have provided two-thirds of the required temperature increase on the young Earth . The remaining increase , he argues , could have been provided by a modest carbon-dioxide greenhouse . <p> The cosmic-ray solution has its own set of uncertainties . First and foremost , the link between climate and cosmic-ray flux is still highly debated . We have only recently begun to understand the correlations between our motion through the Galaxy and its effects on cosmic-ray flux . In addition , we still need a well-developed model of the physical mechanisms involved in both atmospheric ionization by cosmic rays and the subsequent formation of clouds via ionized particles . Finally , just how much does this all depend on atmospheric composition and the amount and reflectivity of land mass on Earth ? Why all the fuss ? <p> Astronomers are working toward a solution to the faint young sun paradox . And while we have some promising leads , we 're still far from a resolution . Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena contributed to warmer than expected climates on both Earth and Mars . <p> But why be so concerned about something that seems , well , insignificant when compared with other cosmic mysteries ? On a fundamental level , the faint young sun paradox is important because it indicates a real gap in our knowledge of stellar evolution . It seems that the evolution of our Sun and stars like it during the first billion years or so on the main sequence is not fully understood . <p> Besides being an interesting problem in its own right , the faint young sun paradox and its resolution has some important implications for astrobiology . The radiative output of the young Sun almost certainly had a major impact on the evolution of planetary atmospheres and planetary climates . This has major implications for the origin of life on Earth , elsewhere in the Solar System , and on planets orbiting other stars . <p> Even though some living things that exist on Earth today can get by without oxygen , all require water . Future searches for terrestrial planets that might harbor life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's habitable zone  --  the region around the star in which liquid water might exist on the surface of the planet . <p> Our searches for life in the Universe are somewhat vexed until we better understand the history of liquid water on Earth . And to do that , we must first understand what might have made our young planet warmer than we would have ever imagined .
