It 's nothing personal , really . The South Park guys are actually sending up situation comedy , Mr. President . So when the George W. Bush character says to a prisoner he 's about to execute , " Hey scum , ready to die by lethal injection ? Maybe you 'd prefer the gas chamber , " and then farts in his face , you have to understand that they 're actually deconstructing a sitcom trope . If anything , Mr. President , Trey Parker and Matt Stone think this is going to be a big boost to your image . " We wanted to take George Bush , who is somewhat vilified , and make him likeable , " explains Stone . " To us , that 's way more subversive than making him look like an a . " <P> If one of Bush 's big campaign promises was to restore dignity to the Oval Office , he 'd better focus on that tax cut . On April 4 at 10:30 p.m . E.T. , Comedy Central will air the first episode of That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the current Administration that finally ends the discussion about how far the media can go in their treatment of a politician 's personal life . In the first few episodes , Bush stages a fake execution for his old frat buddies but mistakenly takes them to the real one ; the Chief Executive steals cable but mixes up the wires and launches a bomb at the Third World ; and an attempted assassination makes the President rethink gun control . <P> But Parker and Stone do n't seem to have any disdain for the President . Neither voted , and they sold the idea of a sitcom about the presidency to Comedy Central ( half-owned by AOL Time Warner , parent company of TIME ) the summer before the election ; the recount pushed the show back from its planned March debut and also reduced the number of episodes from 10 to eight . In fact , before November , the only plot they had sketched out had President Gore trying to convince people that he was the real President while being usurped by a life-size robot . And before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered making a sitcom about the Baldwin brothers . " Sitcoms take a person , like Raymond , and make everybody love him , " says Parker . " So we thought , ' How f up would it be to take a real person and make everybody love him ? ' " Love , in the world of Parker and Stone , does n't involve a lot of coddling . <P> Before they started preparing for the show , which involved watching old sitcoms , taking a trip to the White House and getting a tour of the Everybody Loves Raymond set , neither had watched a sitcom in 10 years . " The ones I hate the most are the ones where the laughs come from people being mean to each other , " says Stone . So in the Bush show they went about spoofing the genre , down to the wacky neighbor , ditsy secretary and , of course , the stupid , bumbling husband . <P> The budget  --  the largest Comedy Central has ever attempted , although it wo n't say precisely how big it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is very expensive for Comedy Central . There 's almost no way they can make money on it , " says Parker . " I 'm thinking we get to do eight of these , and that 's it . But they 'll always be on DVD. "
