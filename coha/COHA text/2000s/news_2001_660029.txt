<p> Cops , lawyers , judges , " perps , " and guards - the law is everywhere in prime time - both on network and cable television . Shows run the gamut from the bad-guy protagonists on the loose in " The Sopranos " ( HBO ) to hard-working cops and prosecutors jailing them on " Law &; Order " ( NBC ) to " Oz , " the horrifying HBO series that looks at life behind bars . The law has pervaded TV history ( as it has the movies ) because " the law is the ultimate American metaphor , " says Robert Thompson , director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University in New York . " This country was always about arguing , negotiating , and often in court - from the compromises of the Constitution on down , " Mr. Thompson says . " It makes perfect sense . that our most dominant stories would be about the law . " For many , the law stands for order in the midst of chaos , civilization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of selfish privilege . Though there are many miscarriages of justice , and unjust laws have been enacted , at the core of American values is the belief in the possibility of justice for everyone . But sometimes the law fails : The system can be abused , good people can be destroyed , and bad people can get away with murder or mayhem . Some TV heroes are trying to prove their innocence before the law - take <p> CBS 's " The Fugitive , " for example . " Before the 1980s , cop and lawyer shows were optimistic , " says media guru Thompson . " They were essentially morality tales . Either through the apprehension or trial of suspects or the vindication of the innocent , you 'd play out a story of good and evil . In ' Perry Mason , ' ' The Defenders , ' ' CHiPs , ' the order was holding , chaos was under control . " But after the ' 80s , things changed . " Hill Street Blues " revolutionized TV dramas , and police dramas in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV cops were corrupt or alcoholics or just tired . That trend continues today with excellent shows like " NYPD Blue " ( ABC ) and " Third Watch " ( NBC ) , which show the very human failings and strengths of the men and women who serve and protect . Unhappy love affairs , a sick child , or the death of a spouse can affect how they do their jobs ( all recent motifs on " NYPD Blue " ) . Confronting constant danger affects their treatment of suspects . And viewers do n't really blame them for losing it a little when a criminal , guilty of a heinous crime , acts up . On the other hand , what shift in American thought has made police brutality , however understandable , all right ? Is the sympathy felt toward those who face danger and who struggle with obdurate iniquity really an excuse for viewers to sympathize with the bending or breaking of the law ( or a face ) ? Howard Varinsky , a trial consultant who has worked on famous cases such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocence barely exists anymore in real courtrooms . The fact that so few defendants in TV courtroom dramas today are innocent further erodes the principle of the presumption of innocence among viewers . One reason viewers are seduced into a complicity with lawmakers breaking the law themselves is that these shows are meant to reassure them : TV policemen represent that " thin blue line " that enforces the law and stands between citizens and a tide of evil crime , says Thompson and other experts . " NYPD Blue " and " Law &; Order " usually get their bad guys . " Walker , Texas Ranger " ( USA Network ) always does , and so do the crime-scene investigators of CBS 's riveting new series " CSI . " " With ' West Wing ' and ' The District , ' we see a return to a kind of optimism about the law , " Thompson says . The bright young White House attorneys on " West Wing " ( NBC ) may play hardball politics , but they are also patriots who want what 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . " The District " ( CBS ) asserts that street crime can be cleaned up - legally , quickly , and without resort to brutality . Both of these excellent dramas are beautifully acted , compassionate , intelligently written , and profoundly involving . " The attitude toward this kind of presentation has changed radically , " Thompson says . " We 're at the point where we say , ' Mark Furman is a reality . Monica Lewinsky is a reality . Where do we go from here ? ' " Both " West Wing " and " The District " are now avant-garde , he says . " The District " is perhaps the most engaging , refreshing , and reassuring of all the police shows on TV , Thompson says . It is based on the real-life experiences of longtime peace officer Jack Maple , who describes the system by which he has helped police forces clean up their various cities . " It comes down to four essential principles , " says Mr. Maple about his method . " One is to have accurate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , you have to take the crime every day and map it so everyone in the organization knows exactly where the problems are . " The second is , after you have things mapped you have to have rapid deployment . Get the officers where the crime is happening , when it 's happening . The third thing is effective tactics and strategies . The last , most important thing you have to have is relentless follow-up . Did the officers follow the first three principles , how did they do it , and did the crime rate go down ? " Every week on " The District , " viewers see new ways in which the chief ( Craig T. Nelson ) enforces these principles , shakes up his department , and reduces crime on the street . Even when he 's unsympathetic , his methods appear to work and even when the stress of the job ruins his personal life , he is the kind of hero viewers want on that front line . While the police on TV are the first line of defense against the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . While good cops and lawyers predominate , sleazy lawyers ( most defense attorneys on " Law &; Order " will do anything necessary to save their guilty clients ) and a few cops on the take can be found on the tube . In director Sidney Lumet 's fascinating new series on A &E,; " 100 Centre Street " ( see interview on page 17 ) , sometimes the lawyers bend or break the law themselves , and the judges do n't always make righteous judgements . In fact , Lumet 's point seems to be that even when guided by the best intentions , the law is only human , never blind , and sometimes it makes dreadful mistakes . Some of these shows court controversy , but the best of them strive for realism and seek advice from real police , lawyers , and judges to get the ambience and the moral right . And many emphasize the struggle and strain the law exacts from its defenders . Are these shows truly reflective of the way law enforcement works ? Mostly , say experts , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See www.findlaw.com for reviews of TV shows by lawyers . ) Filmmakers point out that in the little time they have to tell a story , sometimes they need to take shortcuts . TV law-and-order shows " are all quite dramatized , " says trial consultant Mr. Varinsky . " But they do give people a rudimentary idea of how the law works . " The Practice " ABC and " Law &; Order " particularly stress some of the real issues that arise . " But lawyers are much more professional and cool in their relations with each other in court , he says . And there are misconceptions - juries , for example , do n't regularly give away more money than is warranted in lawsuits . In fact , says Anthony Pesare , dean in the school of Justice Studies at Roger Williams University in Bristol , R.I. , " In all the trials I 've sat through , while there is no perfect prosecution , I 've found that given the law they need to apply , juries generally make the right decisions . " Former New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " honest . The executive producer knows how cops think because he used to be one . But he also flies in detectives from New York to ABC studios in Los Angeles to consult on scripts and talk about the cases they 've worked . The show never ignores issues like race and gender : It explores them and it puts them in perspective . " Everyone has a certain amount of prejudice , " Mr. Clark says . " We took it and put it in the action . But it 's taken to another level when it affects the job you do .. " He adds that policing is basic common sense . Sometimes cops need to adjudicate and pass sentence right on the street . If two brothers get into a fistfight , maybe the best thing to do is separate them and send them home instead of carting them off to jail . We see that kind of common sense often on " NYPD Blue . " The coming ABC comedy " The Job " stars the ever sardonic Denis Leary ( it will replace " Spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of a boozy , philandering , obsessive detective , as hilarious as it can get , still strives for verisimilitude , says executive producer Peter Tolan . Based on the sensibility and real-life experiences of New York cop Mike Charles , who emphasizes the craziness of the criminal mind and the job itself , it rides the razor 's edge of extreme behavior . Shows like " Law &; Order , " " Judging Amy " ( CBS ) , " The Practice , " and " Family Law " ( CBS ) reinforce the idea that juries and judges are fair and perceptive . " Most judges are fair , " trial lawyer Varinsky says . " Though most are cynical , they strive to be fair - no one wants to be overturned . " " Third Watch " is unusual among law shows - its plots turn on the overlapping responsibilities of police , firefighters , and paramedics . " We want to know how it feels to be in their jobs , " says co-executive producer and creator Ed Bernero of his NBC show . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mr. Bernero , who was , like many other producers in this genre of shows , also once a cop . And he points out that law enforcement has incredible turnover , that some of these professionals do indeed turn to alcohol or drugs or infidelity . But cops , firefighters , and paramedics process the chills of their jobs differently - they are not cliches , they are all human beings . In any case , it 's not the lawbreakers who fascinate viewers so much about these shows - their motives are simple - greed or revenge or bloodlust . It 's the law at work audiences want to watch . " We fastidiously try to serve procedure , " says " Law &; Order 's " Barry Shindel . " Sometimes because of time or dramatic constraints , we ca n't . The show is episodic , the stories begin and end in each episode . " Mr. Shindel is a lawyer himself , and he takes his stories from real life .
