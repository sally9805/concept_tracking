The district attorney 's office opposed televising the trial ; the defense favored it . <p> Sara Jane Olson , formerly known as Kathleen Soliah , is charged with placing pipe bombs under two police cars in retaliation for a 1974 police shootout in which six SLA members died .

Olson lawyer Shawn Chapman was a member of Simpson 's defense team . <p> During a hearing , Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler denied a defense bid to delay Olson 's trial , saying he will begin hearing pretrial motions on April 30 . <p> Olson , who attended the hearing , was living as a Minnesota housewife and mother until her arrest in June 1999 after her picture appeared on " America 's Most Wanted .

Beneath a black-draped photograph of Lawton and his wife , fellow APTN producer Elida Ramadani , speaker after speaker called on NATO to identify the person who fired the mortar . <p> " A long time has passed and nothing has been done to clarify the circumstances of how our colleague died , " said Daut Dauti , secretary of the Association of the Journalists of Kosovo . <p> Lawton was covering the deployment of NATO-led peacekeepers along Kosovo 's border with Macedonia on March 29 when he broke off from other journalists to move closer to the village of Krivenik , where NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Kosovo when a mortar shell landed near his car , and shrapnel struck him in his head and side . He was pronounced dead at the U.S. Army hospital at Camp Bondsteel . <p> The attack occurred while Macedonian government forces were conducting an offensive to quash ethnic Albanian insurgents . NATO has promised an investigation , but no conclusions have yet been offered . <p> Both the rebels and Macedonian military have denied responsibility for the 13 mortar rounds that landed in the village . Another man , a teacher , also died in the barrage . <p> " I call on all journalists not to let this issue rest , " Dauti said , calling for pressure on peacekeepers , the U.N . mission in Kosovo and the Macedonian government to identify the perpetrator to " face justice as soon as possible . " <p> Lawton , a 30-year-old British national , and Ramadani were based in Kosovo and were expecting their first child in a few months . <p> Colleagues remembered Lawton for his energy and his happy expectation for his unborn daughter . <p> " Kerem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stress-ridden office . He knew how to handle a situation and to put the whole office into motion , " said Fisnik Abrashi , a colleague in Pristina . " An incredible amount of bad luck cut short his life ... the life with his unborn daughter and his wife in the house they just built . " <p> Martin Benedict , an APTN producer , described Lawton simply , noting that he was just a wonderful guy to be around . <p> " Every day that he came in for the beginning of the shift , it was like someone switched on the light , " Benedict noted with trembling voice . " And now , he 's gone . " <p> &gt;+++++ Ousted Russian independent TV workers aim to continue broadcasts <p> MOSCOW ( AP ) - Journalists and other workers who left NTV after the takeover of Russia 's only non-state nationwide television channel by a Kremlin-connected company said they would n't be silenced by the move and plan to continue independent-minded work on smaller channels . <p> The natural gas giant Gazprom took control of NTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financier named by Gazprom to run NTV in a controversial shareholders ' meeting two weeks ago , took over the offices of the ousted general director , Yevgeny Kiselyov . <p> About 40 NTV employees were forced to resign , and hundreds of others apparently chose to follow . Dissident NTV journalists transmitted news broadcasts on TNT , a channel that is owned by NTV 's former parent company and has a much smaller reach than NTV . The station also broadcast Kiselyov 's signature Sunday night political news show , Itogi . <p> Kiselyov said he had accepted an offer to become acting general director of TV6 , an independent channel that is larger than TNT . It was unclear how many NTV employees would or could go to TV6 , and Kiselyov said he would join only if the station 's original team stayed in place alongside their new colleagues . <p> " I think there is a possibility to make one , new super-team on the renewed TV6 from the two excellent teams , " he said April 15 . <p> He cautioned that his move would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial independence for the station . On Itogi , he called for juridical protection of the journalists from the owners , and a guarantee for the company 's leadership , which would " truly make me and my colleagues who take this leadership upon themselves real managers of this television channel , also protected from the owners . " <p> TV6 belongs to Boris Berezovsky , a one-time Kremlin insider who is on the outs with its current occupants . Berezovsky formerly owned 49 percent of a state-controlled , nationwide channel , ORT , but divested the shares , claiming he was under Kremlin pressure . <p> He also had a bitter rivalry with NTV founder Vladimir Gusinsky , but the two appear to have begun supporting one another . Both are in exile . Gusinsky is in Spain , where he is fighting Russian efforts to extradite him on fraud charges . Berezovsky is in New York . <p> NTV was founded by Kiselyov and a few other journalists in 1993 in the heady early years of former President Boris Yeltsin 's rule . It was financed by Gusinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune in banking . <p> The network recruited young , energetic journalists who quickly made NTV noted for probing reporting , in contrast to ORT and RTR state television . NTV reported extensively and critically on the Kremlin and on the war in Chechnya . <p> But NTV also built up huge debts , most of them to Gazprom , which acquired 46 percent of NTV 's stock . <p> Gazprom , which is 38.4-percent owned by the state and whose board chairman is a top Kremlin official and ally of President Vladimir Putin , says it took over to protect the value of its NTV stake . Gazprom has been at war for months with Gusinsky , who heads NTV 's parent company Media-Most . <p> For many Russian intellectuals and liberal lawmakers , NTV represented one of the major achievements of the post-Soviet decade and the takeover was seen as a deep loss . <p> An NTV advisory council , led by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , called on Putin to " keep his word and put an end to the lawlessness , ordering the general prosecutor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journalists ' legal , professional activities . " <p> A Moscow court is to hold hearings in May on the validity of Jordan 's appointment . Jordan said he would step down if his appointment is deemed illegal . NTV has already lost one court case in the matter . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> Kuwaiti court fines popular Arab news channel for comments <p> KUWAIT ( AP ) - A civil court ordered the Arab world 's most popular satellite TV station to pay more than $ 16,000 in damages for allegedly broadcasting remarks without proof that Kuwaitis killed Iraqis and Palestinians with acid after the Gulf War . <p> A group of 22 Kuwaitis had sued Qatar 's Al-Jazeera all-news TV channel after talk show host Sami Haddad said on the air that , according to some reports , " hundreds of Iraqis , Palestinians and some Kuwaitis ... were dissolved in acid . " <p> Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sided with Baghdad during the 1991 war , which liberated Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation . <p> Salah al-Hashem , the group 's lawyer , said that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new lawsuit . <p> " It is not right that any station insults a people without providing proof , " al-Hashem said . " We consider this a Nazi-like accusation that was not leveled at us even by the Iraqi government . " <p> The $ 16,237 fine levied April 14 is preliminary , meaning that the plaintiffs can now claim more damages . <p> Officials at the Al-Jazeera headquarters in Doha , Qatar , declined to comment . <p> In August , Haddad said on his show , " More Than One Opinion , " that the alleged killings took place before the Kuwaiti government returned to the country . <p> Al-Jazeera , launched in 1996 , quickly became the most popular news station in the Arab world , where most media outlets are state-owned . The station has irked many Arab governments with its critical reports and presentations of controversial issues . <p> Al-Jazeera is widely watched in Kuwait , but many Kuwaitis feel it is biased toward the Iraqi leadership . Two years ago , Kuwait banned the station from reporting from the emirate after an Iraqi caller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaber Al Ahmed Al Sabah . The ban was lifted after one month and the station has since opened an office here . <p> &gt;+++++ Sunday Mirror editor quits after article causes collapse of trial <p> LONDON ( AP ) - The editor of the Sunday Mirror newspaper resigned April 12 , following publication of an interview that led to the collapse of a criminal prosecution against two soccer players . <p> The editor , Colin Myler , had made " a serious error of judgment , " said Mark Haysom , managing director of national newspapers for Mirror Group Newspapers . <p> Lee Bowyer and Jonathan Woodgate of Leeds United were on trial for allegedly being involved in an assault on a student . The case collapsed because the judge said an interview with the victim 's father , published in the Sunday Mirror , could prejudice the jury . <p> A new trial has been ordered for Bowyer , Woodgate and two other defendants , and the newspaper could be charged with contempt of court . <p> Haysom said Myler had followed the newspaper 's procedures and consulted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> &gt;+++++ Ukraine denies popular independent radio its frequency <p> KIEV , Ukraine ( AP ) - In a move criticized as an attack on media freedom , Ukraine 's national broadcasting council has awarded a popular independent radio station 's frequency to another station . <p> Mykyta Poturaev , deputy head of the National Television and Radio Broadcasting Council , said it denied Radio Kontinent permission to continue broadcasting on the 100.9 FM frequency in Kiev because the station is in debt . <p> Apart from its music programs , Radio Kontinent is known for relaying broadcasts of foreign broadcasters including the British Broadcasting Corp . and Voice of America . Opposition journalist Heorhiy Gongadze , whose killing last year has sparked a political crisis in Ukraine , worked with the station . <p> Radio Kontinent director Serhiy Sholokh called the decision politically motivated and said he would appeal it in court . <p> In a statement issued to Ukrainian news organizations , the BBC World Service said the council 's decision was a blow to all independent media in Ukraine . <p> Officials found that Radio Kontinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it obtained at a state bank in 1996 , Poturaev said , according to the Interfax news agency . <p> He said 10 other companies without debts were competing for the frequency , which was awarded to Onykc , a station based in the city of Kharkiv . <p> Some independent and opposition-minded media in Ukraine have complained of harassment by the authorities . The government denies the claims , saying they are meant to cover up the media 's professional and business mistakes . <p> Yet the charges have gained momentum since the disappearance last fall of Gongadze , whose beheaded body was later found in woods outside Kiev . Opposition leaders have accused President Leonid Kuchma and his top aides of involvement - charges they deny . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> ARTS <p> Fiction - Awarded to " The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &; Clay " by Michael Chabon ( Random House ) . <p> Also nominated as finalists : " Blonde " by Joyce Carol Oates ( The Ecco Press/HarperCollins ) ; and " The Quick and the Dead " by Joy Williams ( Alfred A.
