There 's something impossibly optimistic about New Year 's resolutions . Every year , despite a long record of less-than-stellar behavior , we vow with all sincerity to do better and adopt habits that will make us healthier . The good news : New Year 's resolutions pay off more often than lottery tickets . The bad news : the early weeks of January are littered with lapsed plans and unfulfilled promises . To increase the chances of success , we asked some experts for their advice on how to make this year 's resolutions pay off . Here 's what we learned : <P> LOSE WEIGHT We all know that the basic formula is to eat less and exercise more , but being hungry often makes us lose our resolve . Susan Roberts , a nutrition researcher at Tufts University , recommends eating plenty of fiber  --  found in beans , whole-wheat pasta ( there are new varieties that taste better , honest ! ) and , of course , vegetables . Super-high-fiber cereals also help . The aim is to plug up your stomach so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger pangs . " Fiber is n't the only way to lose weight , " Roberts says . " But for people who struggle with dieting because they are hungry , it really seems to help . " <P> STOP SMOKING There are more ex-smokers today than current smokers , says Dr. Steven Schroeder of the University of California , San Francisco . Most folks quit cold turkey , usually after more than one attempt , but you 'll improve your chances with medication  --  like a nicotine patch or gum  --  and some counseling . If you call a stop-smoking hotline like 1-800-QUITNOW , you 'll be given an individualized program that 's based on your smoking history and needs . " Quit lines are smoking cessation 's best-kept secret , " says Schroeder . " They work , patients like them , and they are very convenient . " <P> GET MORE EXERCISE Start small , with simple changes , says James Hill of the Health Sciences Center at the University of Colorado . Buy a pedometer and keep a log of how much you move now . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once you have achieved your first goal , it 's time to set another . <P> REDUCE STRESS The best way to manage stress is through physical activity or yoga , says Dr. Mehmet Oz , a heart surgeon at New York  --  Presbyterian Hospital . " Yoga basically tricks you into meditating , " he says . " I would recommend learning the sun salutation and starting a five-to-seven-minute practice early in the morning . It gets you limber , gets your heart beating and gets you breathing . " <P> Hmm . Five to seven minutes in the morning . Who does n't have time for that ?
