YOUNG FRONTIERSMAN // May 1741 - February 1753 At the end of May 1741 , a young American officer stood sweltering on the sun-baked deck of a warship off the coast of Jamaica . Transports full of red-coated soldiers surrounded him , clogging the horizon with wooden hulls , masts , and sails that announced the presence of a British expeditionary army . As a captain in the provincial infantry , he occupied only a small corner of that army , and counted for little ; but as an American he felt proud to participate in Great Britain ? s glorious military tradition . Or at least he had at first . Now all reason for pride had gone . The army was dying . It had won no laurels , just a watery shroud . Most of the men had perished in the last four months , and disease stalked every survivor . As the American captain watched , daily burials at sea became feasts for frenzied sharks . He had no reason to think that he would not end the same way . Officers enjoyed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , Captain Lawrence Washington found refuge in thoughts of home . He came from Fredericksburg , Virginia , over a thousand miles away . He had not been there in over a year . Letters took weeks to travel each way , and often never arrived at all . Still , writing to his loved ones could make them seem closer , so retreating from the sun to his cabin or a shady place on deck , he turned from the horrors surrounding him , took up a pen , and wrote a letter to his father . // Lawrence Washington wrote as a recent eyewitness to the most important battle of the War of Jenkins ? Ear , and as a participant in its miserable aftermath . Named after the alleged mutilation of English sailor Robert Jenkins , the conflict had started in the summer of 1739 as a minor colonial fray between Great Britain and Spain . The bloodletting centered in the Caribbean , where the British sought to strangle Spain ? s communications with the gold and silver mines of South America by snatching some of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British expected to make short work of the decrepit Spanish empire by capturing the important port of Cartagena off the northeast coast of South America . After this , with the Spanish reeling , they expected to move on to seize the even more important settlement of Havana on the island of Cuba . As plans for its Caribbean offensive jelled in 1739 , the British government announced its intention to form an American regiment to serve as part of an amphibious army of six marine regiments and other regular units . Virginia , whose governor was appointed to command the regiment , provided the largest number of volunteers when recruitment began in the spring of 1740 . The common Virginians made unimpressive soldiers  --  a British observer called them " Blacksmiths , Tailors , Barbers , Shoemakers , and all the Banditry the colonies afford "  --  but their officers were privileged , cultured , and generally intelligent young men , anxious to earn good reputations in battle . Sons of the Old Dominion had besieged colonial officials with requests for commissions , and Lawrence Washington was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available from his colony . Thanks to his family ? s influence and his own considerable personal charm , he received the highest-ranking spot . // The newly appointed Captain Washington followed the American Regiment to Jamaica near the end of 1740 . At first , his soldiers showed little promise . Like the British redcoats , the American enlisted men came from the scum of society ; and the Virginians stood out even in such rough company . Among them were vagrants , loafers , cutpurses , and former convicts . Soldiering did not come naturally to them , as Lawrence and his fellow officers swiftly discovered . They looked bad , too . Only about one in every six of the scrawny , ill-fed men possessed a uniform . British Brigadier General Thomas Wentworth reviewed the Americans on Jamaica in January 1741 and shook his head at the spectacle they presented . Yet there was some innate quality in the common soldiers that he liked . Under proper leadership and discipline , he decided , they might eventually prove useful . For American officers , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na ? ve and stupid , and certain that they would falter in combat , he attempted to replace them with British regulars . But by then the scruffy American enlisted soldiers had bonded with their young officers , and they bluntly refused to serve under anyone else . Irritated , Wentworth relented , but he privately resolved to keep all of the Americans on shipboard during the approaching campaign . It was inconceivable to him that the redcoats might need their provincial allies ? support . Wentworth commanded the land element of the expeditionary force of 8,000 British regulars and 3,000 Americans that left Jamaica in February 1741 . The fleet carrying his troops sailed under Admiral Edward Vernon , a fifty-five-year-old , ill-tempered naval commander known in the fleet as " Grog " because of his grogram cloak . Sailors also applied this nickname to the watered-down rum that he forced upon them . But the ribbing was good- natured . Vernon ? s capture of Porto Bello on the Panamanian isthmus in November 1739 had made him a popular hero . Capturing Cartagena would add to his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fleet dropped anchor off Cartagena in early March 1741 , and the redcoats quickly debarked , eager to fight . Yet their enthusiasm availed little in the ensuing six weeks as the expedition foundered and disintegrated . The British easily invested the port , but instead of storming its fortifications , Vernon and Wentworth quarreled over the plan of attack . // Finally , after weeks of dithering that left the troops gravely weakened by dysentery and malaria , the British launched a large-scale assault on April 9th . Their officers bungled the advance , and the well-entrenched Spanish refused to budge . Nearly 700 redcoats fell slain without penetrating the enemy entrenchments . The siege then stalled while the British returned to the ships where their American allies had spent the last month languishing in stifling heat . Though spared the horrors of battle , the colonials had not been able to avoid the equally appalling threats of heatstroke , fever , and disease . British surgeons and their assistants  --  among them a young writer named Tobias Smollett  --  struggled to care for the sick and wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed . Officers gave up on their duties and avoided their haggard men . The living casually dumped the bodies of dead comrades overboard , strewing the waters of Cartagena with bloated corpses . The trail of bodies led all the way to Jamaica , where the fleet arrived several weeks after abandoning its siege . But that island offered little relief , and the fever epidemic continued unabated . The army ? s effective strength rapidly fell to fewer than 2,000 British and just over 1,000 Americans . Captain Lawrence Washington , by some miracle still alive and apparently healthy despite the carnage surrounding him , had the Cartagena fiasco fresh in his mind as he wrote to his father from on board the British warship in May 1741 . The crisis continued as he wrote , and the expeditionary force still wasted away . Total disintegration was near . Yet he knew the keen anticipation with which his news-starved family would read his letter . His father would seek war news as well as hints on the state of trade and commerce in the Caribbean . His mother would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear about the fates of other friends and relations . And nine-year-old George , Lawrence ? s half brother , would look for descriptions of the roar of the cannon or the sight of infantry boldly charging the Spanish fortifications . None of them would want to hear about a disaster . Lawrence wrote his letter with a mixture of sulkiness and reticence , providing only the briefest summary of the terrible expedition . He did not , or could not , bear to confess that the American Regiment had succumbed to disease without firing a shot . Instead he hid the truth with gentle boasting , including some lines possibly intended for George . " Our Regiment has not recd that treatment we expected , " Lawrence wrote , " but I am resolved to persivere in the undertaking . War is horrid in fact , but much more so in imagination ; We there learn ? d to live on ordinary diet , to watch much , &amp; disregard the noise , or shot of Cannon . " These words must have impressed themselves on the boy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen thirteen years later . // Lawrence returned to Fredericksburg in January 1743 after Admiral Vernon discarded his government ? s grandiose plans for the conquest of the Carib-bean and sent the exhausted troops home . No parades greeted the Americans , who had failed to garner any kind of military glory . Most of the young officers who had left Virginia so confidently in 1740 had not fallen nobly in battle but died in squalid ships ? holds before being dined upon by sea creatures . Veterans discovered that society had grown used to getting on without them , and the best jobs , honors , and appointments had already been taken by the stay-at-homes . The thought that he had squandered some of the most important years of his life must have lain heavily on Lawrence ? s mind . Yet a child ? s love can heal many wounds , as Lawrence learned from his admiring young half brother George . The two came from a large family . Their father , Augustine , born in 1694 , was a soft-spoken but energetic and physically powerful man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood across the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg , and he now owned 10,000 acres and fifty slaves . His first wife , Jane Butler , died in 1729 after bearing three children : Lawrence ( born around 1717 ) , Augustine Jr. , and Jane . Augustine Sr. ? s second wife , the orphan Mary Ball , who had been born around 1708 , gave birth to five more children . George , born February 22 , 1732 , according to the new calendar adopted in 1752 , was the first . He was followed by Betty , Samuel , John Augustine , and Charles . // Among all of his siblings , George developed the strongest bond with Lawrence . And who could blame him for that ? People liked Lawrence . Physically plain , he earned friends with kindness , affability , and good manners . Several years of schooling in England before the war had taught him grace- ful deportment and elegant handwriting . He lacked practicality and business sense , but to a child this may have made him all the more appealing . Lawrence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to answer childish questions that others dismissed as foolish or irrelevant , and George ? s questions  --  which doubtless included how an officer drilled his men , what it felt like to stand on the deck of a warship with all guns ablaze , how it looked when landing boats full of British soldiers set out for shore , and how it sounded when the rattle of musketry and cannon announced their attack  --  always found a friendly ear . The siblings ? relationship grew as the Washington family settled down to everyday life in the first months of 1743 . Lawrence came and went as he angled to become adjutant general of the Virginia Militia . George ? s younger brothers and sister grew under the care of Mary Washington , servants , slaves , and tutors . George had a tutor  --  according to one tradition a convict servant  --  and he learned quickly . As a reward for his studies , or maybe just to get him out of Lawrence ? s hair , Augustine decided in the spring of 1743 to send the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Northern Neck of the Potomac River . George enjoyed the visit , but it did not last long . // In early April , his father , to all appearances healthy and vigorous , rode out in a storm and fell ill . Within a short time , his condition was grave . A messenger called George home , but when he reached Ferry Farm he learned that Augustine had passed away , on April 12th . Augustine ? s sudden death at age forty-nine left George and the rest of the family shorn of a vital source of strength and stability . Adults and children alike would have to assume more responsibilities . Augustine ? s will gave Ferry Farm to George , but if his family told him about the inheritance he may have felt more fear than satisfaction at gaining such a valuable tract . At eleven years old he was far too young to manage it , and without careful stewardship the estate could easily fall into ruin  --  or out of his hands altogether  --  before he reached his majority . Fortunately , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . With remarkable energy , Mary Washington managed Ferry Farm while raising George and his younger siblings . Lawrence , who had inherited a plan-tation on Little Hunting Creek , meanwhile took time out from his own responsibilities to supervise George ? s education and upbringing . Over time Lawrence rapidly took on the role of substitute father , guiding the development of George ? s interests and personality as he became a young man . // The teenage George Washington was neither the budding Hercules of his hagiographers nor the vain , ambitious nonentity concocted by some debunking historians . He was neither an intellectual nor a yokel , but a typical , somewhat precocious boy eager to learn about the world and distinguish himself in it . Inherently somewhat reserved , he nevertheless made several close friends , boys his own age for the most part . In their early teens , they probably shared tales of war and adventure ; later on they traded boasts on their affairs of the heart . " I might perhaps form some pleasures in the conversations of an agreeable young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about seventeen , " as there ? s one now Lives in the same house with me but as thats only nourishment to my former Affair for by often seeing her brings the other into my remembrance . " Washington stood about six feet tall by the time he was a young adult , a height that made him tower over most of his contemporaries . A fine posture , acquired under Lawrence ? s careful tutelage , complemented his height . At twenty-eight a friend called him " as straight as an Indian . " Large of bone but well-proportioned , he possessed a fine mop of dark brown hair over a face with regular and firm but pleasant features . His only physical defects were a slight case of amblyopia , or " wandering eye , " and increasingly bad teeth . Most imposing was the athletic physique he maintained throughout his youth and early manhood . //
