Loud Blouse It was n't so long after my father killed himself that Sheila Gray came to town and told me quite a story . Wait . Let me try that again . And this time , I need you to pay attention to Sheila and the story she told me about my mother . That 's what I wanted you to hear . The part about my father was just for chronology , but it felt like more than that , did n't it ? It made more noise than that . My father 's death turns out to be like a very loud blouse , like a shrill leopard print or an acid Pucci pattern-nearly impossible to coordinate . It overtakes just about anything I put next to it . It would have been simple enough , I suppose , to say that Sheila came to town after my father died . I could have left it at that , and his death might have floated by like a little silk blouse in that version-like an ecru blouse at that , just as unremarkable as can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and center then . But somehow I ca n't say that . Time and again , I 'm drawn away from the little silk blouse , toward the screaming colors of a Versace print : My father killed himself . It feels almost like I have to tell you . Once I 've said this much though , I do n't want to say another word . I want to retreat . Just this much , and not a word more . I want to use his suicide like a stun gun-to shoot you into submission with it , have you defer to me because of it-but I know it does n't work like that . This story does n't make you docile . As soon as I say my father killed himself , the question " how ? " comes roaring back at me , as if the information I gave were disinformation , as if my confession just begged the real question : " So how did he do it ? " And that 's just the beginning . But after I 've climbed so far out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want is to crawl back to safety , toward the solid trunk of a hundred-year-old maple . I 'd like to take a break then-tell you next that he was six feet tall , or that he had lovely gray eyes and smooth , smooth skin . But I know how this works . His faint smell of citrus is of no interest to you . No , you want to know how he did it . My father put a bullet through his head . There , I 've told you . But now you might think he placed the gun at his temple , sideways , and fired . That 's not how it was . You see , when you ask for the " how ? " of it-the " where ? " - you take me right back to the crack of the gunshot , when I 'm nowhere to be found and everywhere at once . Like a man with an airtight alibi whose fingerprints cover every square inch of the murder weapon . When the steel gray bullet with its shiny copper tip is loaded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand lifts the gun heavily upward . When the jaw goes slack . You ca n't ask for more than this : He shot himself through his open mouth and straight out the back of his head . Happy now ? When Sheila Gray started talking , I most definitely did n't ask any questions . Not a one . No , I receded . Let her tell me what she would . I 'd met her only once before , after all . Think 1974 . She flew into town from New Mexico back then-some place she insisted on calling a colony-with long , center-parted hair and a gauzy red gypsy skirt that she wore three days running . She smelled of sandalwood and guessed all our astrological signs correctly . With one look , she saw straight to the heart of me , and still she gave me the highest grade : Libra , just like her . So proud to be seen through , for a change . Are you sure there 's no mistake ? " No , no , " she said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telltale sign of who I might really be-not from her anyway . No , she saw it all , and she liked me just the same . The pride and the gratefulness swirling together like tasty ribbons of Bundt cake batter-all my hidden worthiness baking into something delicious at last . Then she left . Good-bye , Sheila . Only to return twenty years later-this past April-almost six months to the day after we buried my father like a tulip bulb in the fall , never to bloom again in any spring . Within three hours and fifteen minutes of Sheila 's arrival , my mother calls me at home in New York . " Darling , " she whispers into the receiver , but loud , the way she whispers . Shiny little needles prickle my cheeks and the nape of my neck . We 're sharing secrets again ! " I would love to know what the hell she 's doing here , " she says , still whispering . It 's going to be all downhill from here , I know that . But it 's so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother ! She must be off alone in her dressing room , sitting on that spindly wooden chair without arms : A short , plump woman on a chair as delicate as she is sturdy , pinning it down . She 'll have pulled the bedroom door closed behind her and the dressing room door too , but you can still hear her whispering anywhere in the house . " It 's turned nasty already ? " I ask . " What do you know about it , " she says . It 's supposed to be a question , I think , but it does n't sound like one . Her voice stays flat at the end . The picture of her eyes rolling on the other end of the phone is as clear to me as the little puff of frustration I hear through the receiver . She 's worked up now and ready to accelerate . Given Sheila the slip , like the cleverest driver in the fastest car chase ever . I can either climb into the passenger seat or get the hell out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-woman show for that woman , " she says , not even trying to whisper anymore . " She 's come three thousand miles to visit you , " I say . Sheila and my mother have spoken on the phone nearly every Sunday afternoon since time began . She 's my mother 's oldest friend . " But enough about me , " she interrupts . Really ? " What do you think of my Birkenstocks ? " she asks . Oh , I see . She was only joking , just mocking Sheila and her hippie sandals . " I 'd relax if I were you , " I say , mastering the loss . " She 's only been there for a couple of hours . " " Yeah , " she says . " A couple of hours too long . " She 's playing tough now . I 've seen it a million times . Once , we were parked at a service station , and she was arguing with a mechanic about brake shoes . He said she needed new ones . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly the last time she was in . Soon they were raising their voices and repeating themselves . They were escalation incarnate . Then he called her a bitch . I heard him . He said , " Lady , you 're a first-class bitch . " She was n't fazed though , did n't even blink . " That 's Mister Bitch to you , " she said . But I was with her when she drove away too , trembling from the danger so narrowly averted and the heavy price she paid standing up for herself . It was n't as if there was anyone else to stand up for her-or for me either , for that matter . No , she was forced to become the man of the family . Taking care of everything as my father slipped quietly away . It was n't her choice at all . But I 'm in New York now , safe in my own apartment . I try not to care whether she relaxes or not , whether she drives Sheila off or does n't . " I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drinking me out of house and home . " She 's on a rant now . Does n't mean a word of it . " Just roaring through the liquor cabinet . " I 've heard it all before : She offers people drinks , then holds it against them if they accept . " Why her kidneys have n't packed it in by now is the **26;1380;TOOLONG question around here . " " I know , I know , " I say , mock solicitous , a singsong signal that I could n't care less . I got it from her . Defending Sheila is pointless now . Everything about her is horrible to my mother at this moment . Every defense would only constitute further proof of her horribleness . You see , it 's always black and white with her , and very black right now . But Sheila will be back in her good graces in fifteen minutes . That 's the trick : Never counting on her to stick with either one-neither black nor white-because sooner or later , every black reverses to white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has an opportunity to disagree with you . There 's just no predicting which end is up at any given moment . Even if I took up her position right now , mimicked it as flawlessly as an expert drag queen , even if I carried on arguing for her in just the way she would argue herself , it would backfire on me . " Listen , " she says , " I 'd better hang up before she gets into the cough syrup . " I adjust the white pillow behind my neck . Reach for the telephone and dial : 555-PUMP . My phone bills have grown enormous , but I do n't care . " Welcome to the Pump Line ! " a male voice announces , prerecorded and extremely upbeat . " New York 's only phone line for men who are serious about their bodies ! Hang up now if you 're not serious about yours ! " Then he pauses , giving me a chance to assess my seriousness , I suppose . Do n't worry . I 'm dead serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be your guide ! " Like Virgil , I thought once , and now again too , like an echo . " Calls cost fifteen cents a minute , " he says . " Twenty-five for the first . " His whole rap is like a persistent echo . " You must be at least eighteen years old to use the Pump Line , " he says . " When you hang up , you will definitely be pumped ! " Somehow this call has wormed its way into my daily routine over the past several months , as inevitable now in any evening as brushing my teeth , or gazing at my face in the bathroom mirror when I do , checking out my sex appeal through toothpaste foam : The dark , wavy hair and slate gray eyes , the long sharp nose that 's just like my father 's . " Let 's do it ! " Scott says . " Press ' one ' to speak to other guys , one on one ! Press ' two ' to ... " I always press " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flesh-and-blood men . The other options mostly involve prerecorded messages from hustlers or invitations from hard-to-fit men with fetishistic specialties-tie me up , tie me down , take an orange , cut it into slices-that sort of thing , painfully elaborate rituals that just seem like too much work , especially at bedtime . There are group calls too-press " three " -a free-for-all sort of party line , but I can never distinguish between the voices there . I press " one . " " Hang on , " Scott says . " I 'm making your connection right now . " Then he gives away the golden key : " And remember , when you 're finished talking to one guy , just press the pound key , and you 'll be automatically connected to someone new . " The men appear and disappear too with the push of a button . With the push of a button we create and destroy . I try not to think too much about the ones left behind-the victims of the pressed pound key . It 's an individualized world here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interior hot spots and land mines . The architecture designed for sexual efficiency-like pneumatic supermarket doors swinging open and shut with the pressure of an index finger on a dialing pad-hair triggers for the just-off detail , the not-quite-right tone of voice . Everyone knows what it 's all about here : Where were you when I created my sexy universe ? It 's hard to begrudge a man his pound key . There 's a short interlude of electronic music , then Scott again : " Here 's the next guy . " The next guy ? I 've got a connection . But there was no first guy . Never mind that now . " Hello ? " a voice says . A real voice too , not prerecorded at all . I 'm on fire in a flash ! Like Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall ! " Hello , " I say . My heart is pumping faster than a hummingbird's-a thousand beats a minute . No response from my gentleman caller though . My whole body is vibrating with excitement-thrumming on top of the snow white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed as if I 'd been in the sun all day . I reach over and turn off the bedside light . I 'm hot . Even that single bulb is generating too much heat for my racing metabolism . " Hello ? " I say again . But I feel my heart in my mouth . Feel my prospects dimming . He should have said something by now . " I 'm here , " he says . That was a close one ! I feel a pain in my right hand . Look down at it . I 'm clutching the receiver , squeezing it like a drowning man grabs onto the side of a lifeboat , bobbling along in the middle of the ocean . " What 's up ? " he asks . I loosen my grip . " Not much , " I say . Careful to hide the thrill inside me . " Just hanging around . " But my heart is racing still ! " You ? " I 'm careful of my voice too , its pitch and tightness . Nervous that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get together , " he says . I like the sound of him-not like a friend , but not lurid either . " Me , too , " I say , trying for deeper , trying for looser . " Where are you ? " he asks . His voice is exactly what you 'd want in a boyfriend . " In the Village , " I say . " How about ... " Beep . " You ? " I ask , but it 's too late . He 's already moved on to the next guy . He pressed the pound key , which beeps loudly-painfully so , in fact-when you have the receiver at your ear , when you 're still talking . I liked that one too , I think . There are mysteries here , and you might as well get used to them . Maybe he 's far away from the Village . Or maybe he did n't like the sound of my voice . Maybe his lover just walked into the room . I 'll never know . Cut and switch , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend too much time worrying about the last guy . I really wish they could improve that beep technology though-make it just a little softer for the recipient , hopeful still , receiver pressed against his ear . " Here 's the next guy , " Scott says . You see . It 's all about moving on . " Hello , " I say . What 's one false start ? " Hey , man . " " How are you ? " I ask . Revved up all over again . &lt; Continues ...
