1 <p> Monterrey , Mexico , is not to be confused with Monterey , California . This Monterrey is a border town whose main industry and source of employment is a massive tile factory . Monterrey is where Dr. Manuel Mendosa has his small surgical clinic . His father had also been a surgeon , attached to the American army in Vietnam . He always maintained that his finest work had been done during the war , as he was able to finesse his reconstructive surgical abilities on the burned and disfigured soldiers . His only son , Manuel , followed in his footsteps and became a qualified plastic surgeon . He had , under his father 's watchful eye , opened a practice in Mexico City . After his father 's death , Manuel had become addicted to drugs and sunk into debt . Accused of malpractice , he had gone into hiding . Manuel had then been coerced into operating on a known felon , altering the man 's features to enable him to escape imprisonment . <p> Now , known in the underworld for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . He was paid highly for his skill and silence , but he was nevertheless trapped and in constant fear for his life , should he ever refuse a request . <p> When Manuel received a call from a Mr. Smith , he knew this was yet another " operation " requiring his skill as a surgeon . He knew too that his life would depend upon his silence . <p> Mr. Smith was not American but English , and his arrival at the clinic , although expected , was met with trepidation . The patient was so tall he had to stoop to enter the small reception room . He was well dressed in a cream-colored suit and a white T-shirt . He carried a thin leather briefcase . <p> If Manuel felt trepidation ; so did his new client . Miles from anywhere in the border town , he had arranged the meeting on word of mouth , hearing that Manuel was a genius . He had not expected to confront one of the most handsome men he had ever seen . Manuel was slender with beautiful artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every feature of his face chiseled , teeth white and gleaming . His pale blue cotton shirt with its priest collar , almost like a surgeon 's short gown , was obviously handmade . The color made his wide , clear eyes even bluer , like azure . <p> He was sitting expectantly as Mr. Smith entered . <p> " Good morning , " the Englishman said . <p> " You needed to see me ? " Manuel said quietly , in fluent English . <p> " Yes . That is correct . " <p> " You were recommended ? " <p> " Yes . By ... " <p> The Englishman said two names that sent chills down Manuel 's stiff spine . He knew who they were  --  men he could not refuse . <p> " I will pay you in dollars . " <p> Manuel nodded and watched as the big man sat uncomfortably on one of the hard chairs in the reception area . He had no receptionist and no nurses . Only one person assisted him in his operations  --  an elderly Mexican , Enrico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need to take some particulars and discuss exactly what is required . " <p> " Obviously . " <p> Manuel liked his deep resonant voice , the way he appeared respectful . And yet there was a domineering confidence about him . <p> " Firstly , may I ask your age ? " <p> " Sixty . " <p> Manuel leaned forward and picked up a clipboard from the coffee table . <p> " Do you suffer from high blood pressure ? " <p> " Slightly . " <p> " Have you had any recent operations ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Do you have any heart problems ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Do you have any allergies ? " <p> " No . " <p> " No allergic reactions to antibiotics ? " <p> " None . " <p> Manuel used a slim silver pen to write on his clipboard . <p> " Have you any blood disorders ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Do you have transport ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Somewhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Manuel replaced the board onto the coffee table . <p> " Now I need to discuss the exact surgical requirements and modifications you would like me to achieve . " <p> Mr. Smith had started to sweat in the overheated reception ; it was eighty degrees outside and there was no air-conditioning in the room . Compared to Manuel , he felt overweight and clumsy . <p> " I need to look younger . " <p> Manuel nodded , watching as Mr. Smith removed from his pocket a large envelope . He took out a thin folded piece of paper . <p> " Let me start with the liposuction . I want you to remove the excess fat from my stomach , armpits , and chest area , and I want my buttocks lifted , so they are tighter and stronger . I 'll leave it up to you whether implants are required . " <p> Manuel nodded . That part of the procedure was simple . <p> " I will also want my hands looked at , get rid of the age spots , get my fingerprints lasered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his clipboard again . He turned over the top page and started jotting down notes . <p> " How tall are you ? " he asked . <p> " Six feet three and a half . " <p> " Your weight ? " <p> " Nineteen and a half stone . " <p> Manuel tapped the silver pen against his perfect teeth as he calculated what the weight was in kilos . Mr. Smith watched him , struck again by his handsomeness . He wondered if he was homosexual . Manuel wore no wedding ring , no jewelry of any kind , not even a wristwatch , and he seemed to remain cool , not perspiring at all in the oppressive heat . <p> " You want me to continue ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Right . I want a new face . Nose , cheek implants , maybe even a little chin enhancement , and I want the mole on my right cheek removed . " <p> Manuel looked up and stared hard as Mr. Smith concentrated on the notepaper . He could see there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his age . His gray hair , worn in a ponytail , was thinning , he had a hooked nose . His face had slight jowls and was heavily lined , as if he had spent many years in the sun . His lips were thin and his teeth stained yellowish from smoking . His eyes were dark brown and lined at the corners with hooded lids . Yet he was still what one would describe as handsome  --  or had been at one time . <p> " May I see that ? " Manuel asked , with his hand outstretched . <p> Mr. Smith passed over the single sheet of paper . Manuel studied it for a considerable time . There were a number of drawings and indications of what plastic surgery was wanted . <p> " This is very extensive and invasive surgery , Mr. Smith . " <p> " I 'm aware of that . " <p> " When do you want to begin ? " <p> " After this meeting . " <p> Manuel continued making his own notes . It was just after ten o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in one session . " <p> " That will be impossible . The liposuction alone will take considerable time and it will be painful , requiring a few days to settle before the bandages can be removed . You will also need to wear elastic surgical bandages to maintain the tightness of the skin . " <p> " Yes , I know . " <p> " So may I suggest we start with the less invasive surgery and then judge how soon you would be fit enough to begin everything else ? " <p> " No . I want everything done as soon as possible . I 've brought with me the required amount of Fentanyl in preference to any other anesthetic . Are you familiar with this type of  --  " <p> Manuel interrupted him . " I 'm aware of the use of Fentanyl for emergency surgery and that it is now quite commonly used in many hospitals as a fast means of pain blockage . I know how quickly , unlike most anesthetics , it leaves the system . But it 's a very potent opiate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as an intravenous anesthetic , but I 've never employed it . " <p> " I will determine how much I need . " <p> " That is a great risk , Mr. Smith , and one I am not prepared to take . You will require a general anesthetic , but it is up to you if you wish to use the Fentanyl as a means of pain relief . " <p> Manuel put his silver pen back into the breast pocket of his shirt . He hoped his request for a general anesthetic would make his client change his mind . It did n't . <p> " Very well . If that 's what you advise . " <p> " Have you eaten anything today ? " <p> " No , not since midnight . " <p> Manuel leaned over to a pocket built into the side of the chair . " I will need to call my assistant , " he said . <p> Mr. Smith noticed for the first time that Manuel was sitting in a wheelchair and it freaked him . <p> " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dialed . " One of my own designs  --  very light and battery-controlled . " <p> " You 're a cripple ? " <p> Manuel gave a strange half smile . " Does it worry you ? I do not operate with my feet , but if it concerns you ... " <p> " What 's the matter with you ? " <p> Manuel had dialed a number on his mobile phone , but he did n't connect the call . <p> " I was addicted to crack cocaine . My spine was injured in a fall . " <p> " Are you still an addict ? " <p> " I will be for the rest of my life , but I am no longer a user . I 've been clean for four years . " He held the phone up . " Have you changed your mind ? " <p> Mr. Smith hesitated and then gave a curt shake of his head . <p> " Make the call , " he said . <p> Manuel wished he had walked out , but his client was obviously satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In contrast to the reception room , the adjoining operating theater was cold . Mr. Smith felt every hair on his body tingle . He was instructed to use a small shower room to scrub his body clean with the disinfectant provided . <p> Then Manuel introduced Enrico , who led Mr. Smith to the table . He had already prepared a row of needles and the vials of Fentanyl . He checked the client 's heart rate and blood pressure , which he noted was high  --  180 over 120 . He prepared a vein catheter for Mr. Smith 's right hand and found a vein easily , attaching it for the anesthetic to be given . An aspirator machine stood ready for the liposuction ; large packs of gauze and two big bottles of Xylocaine and adrenaline , plus dark bottles of iodine were at hand . Different rubber tubes were ready to connect to the cannula tubes , to attach to the liposuction machine . Next , Enrico opened Mr. Smith 's gown and , using a paintbrush , painted three quadrants , center of his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an oxygen mask ready and a resuscitation machine in full working order . He attached a small clip onto Mr. Smith 's index finger , which led to a machine to enable them to read the heartbeat . All of this was completed in total silence . <p> Enrico then went to assist Manuel to scrub up in a large sink . Manuel let him scrub both his hands with alcohol gel and wheel him to the trolley so he could open the paper-wrapped gloves . <p> " Do you wish to inject yourself ? " Manuel asked his client . It took a while for Mr. Smith to measure the exact amount before clenching his left fist and then watching as Enrico adeptly found a strong vein and injected him . It was very fast ; Mr. Smith just had time to lie back before he felt the warmth spreading throughout his body . <p> " You can get started , " he said , his voice slurred . <p> He eventually became used to the hideous sound of the suction pump working . The incisions for the cannula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his foot to keep the pump working as the fat drained into two big vats . It took three and a half hours . At one point Manuel was concerned : Mr. Smith 's pulse rate was at ninety-eight . He used the oxygen mask and waited for the pulse to return to normal . <p> Manuel worked quickly , inserting the tubes and pumping out the fatty tissue . For him , it was a tedious , long-drawn-out procedure . He sat making drawings for the facial work he was asked to complete . Twice during the liposuction Enrico gestured for Manuel to double-check their patient ; he also needed his help to turn the big man over to take the fat from his buttocks . Manuel , for all his incapacity , was very strong in the upper part of his body , and together they had been able to move him . <p> One of the most strenuous parts of the suction process was drawing on the tight elastic bandages to make sure the body parts , where the fat had been removed , were held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandages , then an elastic corset eased over the belly and chest . In truth , the wrapping this time was perhaps too tight , but Mr. Smith was a very big man and Manuel reckoned he was so macho , he would be able to deal with the constrictions and the painful bruising he was going to feel . They had removed an astonishing two and half liters of body fat . The next process was to tighten his buttocks . A banana-shaped incision was to be made across each cheek . Manuel calculated that he would spend at least an hour and a half on each , due to the number of internal stitches required layer by layer . The first general anesthetic was administered . <p> Whatever pain he felt , three hours later Mr. Smith sat up asking for water . He drank thirstily before resting back and closing his eyes . His entire body felt as if it had been run over by a ten-ton truck . The pain was making his head throb ; it was excruciating and he could find no comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you need before you work on my face ? " he asked hoarsely . <p> Manuel leaned close to him , checking his pulse . <p> " I really can not begin any more surgery . I suggest you rest for two days . Then we will be able to remove these bandages so you will be more comfortable . " <p> " I do n't have that amount of time . I want it done today . " <p> " I have to refuse . Your blood pressure was very high and you will need to have a second general anesthetic . It will be impossible to operate using only Fentanyl . " <p> " You get another ten thousand dollars if you continue . " <p> " It is too much of a risk . The work will take at the very least three hours . I have to virtually lift your entire face off and  --  " <p> " Just do it . " <p> " I advise you to rest at least for tonight and return tomorrow . " <p> " Do it ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure he did not overdose on the Fentanyl . He trusted no one but himself to measure it . The pain dulled by the Fentanyl , he closed his eyes . <p> Enrico was silent , as usual , as he cleaned up and removed the bloody gauze pads . He was surprised when Manuel asked if he could remain all night at the surgery . He gave a small nod of his head and continued clearing up . <p> When Manuel returned to the table , Mr. Smith was already lying motionless , his eyes closed . <p> " He is mad , " Enrico whispered . <p> " For Jesus ' sake , do n't let him die on us . And make me some strong black coffee . " Manuel raised his electric wheelchair to its maximum height . He would now be able to work from above the sleeping man 's head and move easily around to the left and right of the table . <p> Using a black marker pen to draw the lines on Mr. Smith 's face where he wished to cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brow . He marked the upper and lower lids and made a line around both ears for an auricular incision . He then marked the lips to augment with silicone and put dotted marks between the eyes for Botox . <p> As he worked , he drank two small cups of thick black coffee , with heaped spoonfuls of sugar . His patient remained oblivious , eyes closed and sleeping . <p> Enrico prepared the prosthetic implants for the cheeks and chin , and when Manuel was ready , he administered the second general anesthetic . It was , by now , almost six o'clock and cooler outside , but as always Manuel maintained a very low temperature in the operating room . They both went through the same procedure of scrubbing up , and now that the anesthetic had kicked in , work began . <p> The first incision was to the eyebrows . Manuel removed a slice , like a small section of orange , drawing the skin upward , and stretching out the lines in the forehead . This took a lot of pulling and stretching before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind the ear , continuing down to the chin . He drew up the scraggy skin of the neck , again removing a slice like another section of orange , so he could restitch and pull tightly back toward the lobes of the ears . He also implanted a small section of what looked and almost felt like a sponge . He inserted a piece into the lower chin , then used a thin flattening spatula to ease up two more sections to rest over each of the cheekbones , working with the finest suture scissors . He removed the mole from Mr. Smith 's right cheek and gave two neat stitches , before he began work on his nose . <p> Twice , Manuel became concerned as his patient 's pulse shot up ; his heart rate was worrying too and it was a while before he felt he could continue . Enrico gave Mr. Smith more oxygen until they were both satisfied that his pulse rate was not life-threatening . <p> The bridge of the nose had a scar ; his nose must have been broken at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting around the nostrils . He was tired ; it had been concentrated work and Enrico kept wiping his brow with an iced cloth . <p> " Only eyelids to go now , " he murmured . <p> The two men worked well together , Manuel checking his drawings and the ink markings he had made to Mr. Smith 's face . He did n't want to take too much from the eyelids , and as he was doing both top and bottom , it was imperative he took only his exact measurements . He could n't remove the age lines from around the eyes completely , nor the two lines from the nostrils down to the lips , known as puppet lines . These he injected with Botox and collagen , and then at last it was down to the bandages . <p> Mr. Smith did not regain consciousness until his head was tightly bandaged . He resembled something out of an old-fashioned horror movie . Only his puffy , bloodshot eyes and his swollen lips could be seen . He could not dress himself , as his hands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingertips . Enrico had to ease him into an old wheelchair to take him out into the reception . <p> Mr. Smith was hardly holding it together due to the waves of pain that swept over his entire body . There seemed not an inch of him that did n't scream out . He said hardly a word as Enrico wheeled him out into the early evening sun ; he had been in surgery for over ten hours . A white , four-door Mercedes with tinted windows was parked outside . The driver had been waiting all day ; his face was sweaty and his cheap black suit wrinkled and creased . His dark greasy hair was combed back and hung in a wave at his collar . <p> Enrico and the driver helped Mr. Smith into the backseat . He let out soft moans of pain , but he did n't speak , just lay on his side , his legs curled up . <p> Manuel watched the Mercedes drawing away . He had learned over the years never to ask questions or get into even the briefest conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could check on the liposuction treatment and a further five days to examine and remove stitches . It would therefore be seven days before he was paid . <p> " Mr. Smith " was hurried through the lobby of the Santa Cruz Hotel in the wheelchair . He was occupying the so-called penthouse suite . He found it difficult to even sit on the bed and he had n't the strength to take off his clothes . He finally managed to ease himself down , thankful for the soft pillows . <p> The driver left the hotel with instructions to collect him in seven days . <p> Mr. Smith remained lying on the bed for twenty-four hours , before he managed to undress . Beside the bed were an array of bottles of water , vitamins and antibiotics , and a large amount of arnica tablets . He consumed them in handfuls , as they helped the bruising , but ate nothing else , just drank bottle after bottle of the water and only moved to go to the bathroom . He was in constant pain and found it difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him feel as if his body was on fire . Not only did the elastic bandages around his body feel too tight , but the dressings on his scalp and face were so uncomfortable that he found it difficult to breathe . His head throbbed . The discomfort did n't ease for forty-eight hours and he had , once again , injected himself with Fentanyl . <p> Manuel and Enrico entered the hotel suite to find Mr. Smith lying on the bed with a towel wrapped loosely around him . Manuel watched as Enrico removed the wrappings from his body . The bandages were very bloody , as there had been some leakage . The torso was black from the bruises and yet the small incisions made for the tubes were healing well . Manuel placed small strips of Elastoplast over the incisions and then waited as Enrico cleaned up the bloody bandages and gauze . He unwrapped the bandages from around Mr. Smith 's head , checked his stitches were healing , and instructed Enrico to rebandage . <p> " You are healing very well , Mr. Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabid animal chewing on it ! " <p> Neither Manuel nor Enrico showed they were amused ; they left as quickly as possible . <p> On the fourth day , Mr. Smith got up and walked around the suite . It was painful but he forced himself to move . He still did not eat but sent down for more water , lemons , and honey , and continued to use his Fentanyl stash to give him relief and help him sleep . <p> By day seven he was feeling stronger . Fully dressed , he walked down through the hotel reception to meet his driver . <p> Manuel was waiting at the surgery . He could see that his patient was making a remarkable recovery and could walk unaided from the car . They went straight into the operating room ; Enrico had already prepared a tray with disinfectant swabs and needle-sharp scissors . There were still extensive black bruises almost covering the patient 's entire torso . However , the small incisions were healing well , and Enrico cleaned them and replaced the small round plasters . Manuel then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong lamp , and he personally unwound the head bandages . The fine , delicate stitches were snipped one by one and Mr. Smith could hear a faint sound as each was placed into a stainless-steel bowl . Once the last area of plaster across the nose had been removed , Manuel leaned close to inspect his work . <p> " Good , very good . " <p> Mr. Smith examined himself in a mirror . His face was puffy and the scars were still red , but none were infected , and within hours the narrow bridge of his nose would broaden . His thinning hair was dirty and the ponytail was caked in blood . He had not had a total browlift because of his receding hair ; hair plugs would have made the skin too stretched and raw . <p> " How soon can I get plugs done for a hairline ? " he asked Manuel . <p> " In a couple of weeks , I would suggest . " <p> " What about the teeth ? I can begin a series of dental implants , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Manuel was astonished that his patient gave no reaction to his finished work . It was , even by his standards , a superb transformation . The man hardly resembled himself , yet he seemed intent only on leaving as quickly as possible . Manuel was paid twenty-five thousand dollars in used notes , packed into a large brown envelope . Smiling , Mr. Smith passed over a second envelope containing the extra ten thousand dollars . <p> Manuel placed the money into the pocket of his wheelchair without counting it . Then Mr. Smith surprised him . He was about to click shut the briefcase when he hesitated and removed a small square box which he passed over to Manuel . <p> " A little extra gift , " he said . " Enjoy ... " <p> He strolled out , albeit stiffly because the liposuction still made it uncomfortable to walk . His suit hung as if too large and he placed a cream cotton cap on his head to cover his scalp and donned a pair of dark sunglasses . <p> Back in his hotel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection in the dressing-table mirror . It was an amazing transformation : his chin and neck were taut and the cheek implants made his face look chiseled . His lips were still puffy but his nose was looking much better . Before , he had had an aquiline , almost hooked nose ; now it was small but perfectly straight . <p> After a much-needed shower , he looked again at his reflection . Gone was the beginning of a paunch and he had regained a muscular slenderness . In fact , he had dropped at least fifteen years ; by the time he had his hair transplants and new teeth , he reckoned he would look no more than late forties or early fifties . <p> Enrico had returned home to his family . As ever , Manuel had been very generous , but he was concerned . The box had contained four vials of Fentanyl , and when he had tried to take it , Manuel had snapped at him to leave it in the fridge . Fentanyl was unobtainable in Mexico and he feared that the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mr. Smith flew to Los Angeles and from there on to Brazil for the rest of his makeover . Although he was still feeling some twinges of pain , the worst of it was over . He did as Manuel instructed and waited another six weeks before he had a full transplant of hair , not gray , but dark brown , combed back from his forehead and cut into a shorter style . Now it was just below his collar , exactly as Manuel had worn his . <p> Lastly , he had a three-week session with a dental surgeon who implanted six back teeth and gave him what they termed in Hollywood " the smile " makeover . By this time he had begun to work out , not too strenuously , but he wanted to retain his slenderness . <p> The entire " operation " had taken almost three months and he was finally ready to return to England . Money was running out and he was about to make one of the biggest deals of his life . His luxurious life had been disrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money markets , leaving him on the verge of bankruptcy . Never one to dwell on misfortune , however , he was certain that he could  --  and would  --  once again return to the lifestyle he had grown accustomed to . With his new image , he was confident that he could remain undetected until his deals had been organized . <p> Leaving Brazil , he flew to Spain to arrange finances for a boat he had ordered to be brought into Puerto Banus . Money by now was a major problem ; he had to get financed and fast , and it had to be cash . But he remained assured that he would be able to accomplish his deal . <p> However , dealing with drug cartels from Colombia , he could not afford to make any mistakes . <p> One mistake would obviously have been his connection to Manuel , but as a man who had been around drugs and addicts for many years , he was sure that temptation would rid him of any risk from that quarter . He was correct . Enrico , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the clinic . He knew by the accumulation of black flies in the overheated reception room that what he had feared had happened . <p> Due to the low temperature in the operating theater , Manuel 's body was not too decomposed . The still-handsome man sat in his chair , his dead eyes staring , as if at the open box of Fentanyl resting on his lap . He had used only one vial but that had been more than enough to stop his heart . <p> Mr. Smith made arrangements to return to England . He doubted that he would have problems entering the UK and he was looking forward to " going home " once more . He was also confident that , using one or other of his many passports , he would not be recognized , even by his own mother . <p> Copyright 2008 by Lynda La Plante <br> Continues ...
