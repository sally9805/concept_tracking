<p> Etta Jones is in the Yacht Club , singing " I Could Have Danced All Night . " Carrie Smith is cooking up a storm in the Grand Lounge with " Goin ' to Kansas City . " Lou Donaldson is blowing " Bye Bye Blackbird " on his sax in the Theater and talking about the blues : " If you never had ' em , you ca n't play ' em . " The crowd loves it . " You 've got that right , baby . " <p> We 're at sea for the 17th annual Floating Jazz Festival , which is a tribute to trumpeter Clark Terry , and this joint is jumping . The ship is swinging and swaying , and the ocean is n't even rough . We 're on our way from Miami across the South Atlantic to Southampton , England , and will have only two ports of call on this 10-day cruise  --  Tenerife , Canary Islands , and Funchal , Madeira . The ports , at least for me , are incidental . The rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry and pianists Oscar Peterson and Monty Alexander are the hook for me in deciding to do this cruise as my vacation . Besides , the QE2 , the only scheduled transatlantic liner and flagship of the Cunard Line , is my favorite ship . I 'm curious if it 's been " Carnivalized " since Carnival Cruise Lines bought it about two years ago . It has n't . <p> I 'm also curious what the South Atlantic is like in November  --  very calm compared with the North Atlantic this time of year , until we leave Madeira and enter the Bay of Biscay headed for England . <p> I 'm excited about some of the other headliners as well , but by the end of the cruise I 've become a fan of musicians I 'd never heard of . <p> Other groups that are part of the festival are the Shirley Horn Trio , the Jimmy Heath Quartet , the Nicholas Payton Sextet , Carol Sloane and her Trio , Vanessa Rubin and her Quartet , the Henry Johnson Quartet , Junior Mance and the Floating Jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , as well as Clark 's Kids , future star musicians nurtured by Terry , 79 , who still has incredible chops . <p> There 's music day and night in five rooms . A trio or a quartet plays almost every afternoon in the Grand Lounge and another in the Theater . At night in the Theater , two groups play back to back . The Yacht Club features a third group , while another is in the Crystal Bar , followed by Jones or Drew . Impromptu jam sessions are known to continue here until 5 a.m . Clark 's Kids play most nights in the Golden Lion Pub , and passenger jam sessions are scheduled three nights . <p> And I thought I was going to veg out and get lots of rest . Silly me . <p> In addition to the live music , an in-cabin TV channel features videos of jazz performances , film clips and old jazz-related movies , starting at 8 a.m. and continuing until midnight . <p> Also , four meet-the-stars question-and-answer sessions are held , as well as three autograph/CD sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poster to have the musicians sign , not to mention how many CDs I buy . Of course , there 's a Floating Jazz Festival T-shirt I ca n't live without . <p> One afternoon , I do n't even let Peterson go to the bathroom in peace . Since he has n't been at any of the autograph sessions , I snag him as he 's coming out of a restroom near my cabin . " Mr. Peterson , " I ask , " if I run and get my poster , would you please sign it ? " Of course , he obliges . <p> Terry , like many of the musicians , shows he has humor and genius offstage as well . At one of the question-and-answer sessions , a passenger asks the panel of musicians whether there 's anyone they would like to have played with . <p> " Brigitte Bardot , " Terry quips . <p> Another passenger asks whether Peterson , who suffered a stroke several years ago and has difficulty walking , will ever be 100 percent again . <p> " I 'm now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 100 percent , " he says . " Through the love and understanding of my wife and little girl and dear friends , I was able to face the piano again . " <p> Says Terry , who is the godfather of Peterson 's daughter , Celine : " O.P. now plays almost as normal as the rest of us . " <p> Malcolm Shaw and his wife , Beth Brubaker , jazz buffs from Denver , are among the 1,567 passengers on this cruise . <p> " All this music is taking the place of ( usual shipboard activities such as ) napkin-folding and origami . It 's a real pleasant experience I totally did n't expect , " Shaw says . " Here you 've been able to talk to the folks , even go to rehearsals . It 's a bit like a master-class workshop . " <p> " You feel privileged to hear them , " Brubaker adds . <p> They think that " the jazz thing is marvelous " but do n't share my love for the QE2 . Brubaker says that , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallways of their cabin deck and that the cabin staff is noisy . <p> " And we do n't necessarily have hyacinth-bouquet expectations , " Shaw says . <p> Mike Eldridge , another Denverite , is working on the QE2 as a cocktail-hour pianist in the Crystal Bar . He 's in heaven with all the jazz . <p> " I 'm shaking in my boots when Oscar came in one night before Junior Mance was playing in this room , " he says . " All the piano players who try to emulate Oscar do n't even come close . " <p> Many passengers are on the ship specifically because of the jazz , but others did n't have a clue , including a group of about 100 Brits who are sailing 28 days round trip from Southampton . They 're unhappy about not having the traditional shipboard Broadway-style shows , especially because an earlier leg of the cruise had been all big bands . We hear through the grapevine that the captain plans a special cocktail party for them to try to soothe feelings and that his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play for it . <p> Harold and Dottie Fearon of Tempe , Ariz. , also had n't been aware of the jazz beforehand but are enjoying it . <p> " We simply do n't know jazz , but it 's fun , " she says . <p> This is their fourth trip on the QE2 , and they think the ship is getting a little shabby . <p> " It 's not quite up to the QE2 standards , " she says , hopeful that a monthlong refurbishing planned immediately after our sailing will get the vessel shipshape before they sail on it again in April . ( Though more recent news for the QE2 was bad , as it failed a sanitation inspection last month . ) <p> Hank O'Neal and Shelley Shier , husband-wife producers of the festival based in New York with their company , Hoss Inc. , came up with their first Floating Jazz Festival in 1983 on the Norway , where it 's been staged every year until now . Two more floating jazz festivals will be on the QE2 this year , in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to restructure the festival and significantly change the scope of it , " Shier says . " Also , they changed the decor , and everything is like a sports bar . You ca n't present good jazz in a locker room . It 's embarrassing to have people you respect in that kind of setting . " <p> In addition to booking all the musicians , O'Neal and Shier must deal with the varying egos of about 70 musicians and their wives or significant others . They also have to make sure all the sound equipment and instruments get onto the ship . And on the day we dock in Tenerife , they 're dealing with piano movers who must switch the keyboards between the Theater and the Grand Lounge in preparation for Peterson 's only concert that night . <p> " It 's not the right piano for Oscar , " she says . " He has in his contract what kind of piano . He gets to do that . You know , he does n't need the job . . . . This is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " <p> All the musicians are paid . <p> " It 's more than a paid vacation , " she says . " It 's a gig  --  and it 's a good gig . . . . There is n't anybody who has said ' no ' to us . Sonny Rollins turned us down because he wo n't go near water . It 's an opportunity for them to be on board with their friends in relaxed circumstances . " <p> What 's their worst nightmare in producing the festival ? <p> " That someone does n't show , " Shier says . <p> She says the only cancellations in all these 17 years have been because of death . A travel agent was upset once because Buddy Rich was n't onboard as advertised . <p> " ' You promised us Buddy Rich , ' the agent kept insisting . I told her : ' But Buddy Rich is no longer on this earth . He died . ' " <p> O'Neal and Shier ask passengers to complete a comment sheet at the end of the cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing they would change about the festival . <p> " This is a passenger-driven event , " O'Neal says . " We want to assemble as broad a thing as possible . It 's as easy to do a good event as a bad one . " <p> I give the cruise a glowing report card . My only disappointment is that Peterson and Alexander do n't play enough . But I have no real complaint  --  other than that I 've become a jazz junkie . <p> By the end of the cruise , I 'm addicted to Etta Jones . Maybe she could have danced all night , but I 'm wishing she could have sung all night .
