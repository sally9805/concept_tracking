<p> When it 's too late to count how many shopping days remain till Christmas , Hanukkah or Kwanzaa , a quick trip to your conveniently located bookstore can save your sanity . It can also keep your reputation from slipping into the Grinch category . <p> We 've reported on some great books for the cook in the last few weeks ( go to SFGate. com and enter " cookbooks " ) . Here are a few more delicious additions that were published this fall . <p> " The New American Cooking " by Joan Nathan ( Alfred A. Knopf , 447 pages , $35 ) is a multiethnic departure for the veteran author best known for " Jewish Cooking in America . " The meals she explores in her latest volume focus on the foods that have migrated to our shores in the suitcases , backpacks and , most of all , the culinary memories of new Americans . They hail from countries as close as Mexico or as far as Croatia , Lebanon or India and have insinuated themselves into the potato-and-meat culture considered quintessential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the United States gathering recipes in likely places  --  big-city restaurants  --  and unlikely ones  --  a home brewer and teacher of herbal cooking in the Ozarks . <p> Examples : She credits San Francisco celebrity chef Bradley Ogden with making mashed potatoes chic ( the recipe : garlicky unpeeled mashed potatoes ) and Arkansas cook Marion Spear with Japanese-inspired dishes ( the recipe : an omelet with chopped greens , cilantro and shiitakes ) . <p> Berkeley 's Edible Schoolyard , founded by Alice Waters , gets a nod from Nathan with a recipe for an autumn harvest soup , served during the British royals ' recent visit to the project . It 's one of many dishes paying homage to organic and sustainable foods . <p> The book is organized along traditional lines , from breakfast/brunch to soups , salads , fish , poultry and meat and desserts , rather than ethnic origin , so jumps from country to country and continent to continent can be dizzying . The book gives America-the-melting-pot a whole new meaning . <p> " Emeril 's Delmonico " by Emeril Lagasse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110-year history of this legendary New Orleans restaurant that was named after New York Delmonico 's ( founded in 1827 ) , but evolved into a temple to Creole cuisine . <p> Lagasse , who had already made a name for himself in the Big Easy with Emeril 's and Nola restaurants , took over Delmonico 's in 1997 and reopened it post-Katrina on Dec. 8 ( dinner only ) . <p> For the book , the chef , who has a national following with his TV show , has slightly modified some recipes to make them doable for the home cook . <p> They still tilt toward indulgence : Eggs Pontchartrain piles poached eggs , fried oysters and crisp bacon on English muffins and covers the whole with tasso hollandaise ; baby lamb chops crusted in Parmesan and rosemary are anointed with a rich red wine syrup ; a Stilton potato gratin is sumptuous with cheese and heavy cream ; and for a relativelysimple finale , there is bourbon vanilla creme brulee . <p> The recipes are clear and easy to follow , but no nutritional analysis is provided  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Giuliano Hazan ( Scribner , 434 pages , $35 ) is the latest creation of the Hazan family . Giuliano is the son of legendary Italian cooking teacher and author Marcella Hazan and wine honcho and teacher Victor Hazan . In this his third book , Giuliano Hazan starts with unfussy advice on utensils and techniques and proceeds to the kind of gutsy but rarely complicated recipes that are the hallmark of true and traditional Italian home cooking . <p> Fettucine with artichokes has just seven ingredients , veal scaloppine with Marsala , six . And what he calls Very Simple Potato Salad is just that  --  red potatoes , coarse sea salt , extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar . It 's a salad stripped to the basics , though the author emphasizes that the ingredients have to be of superb quality : the best olive oil you can afford , fine vinegar and premium salt , such as fleur de sel . <p> It 's a book that 's tempting in its simplicity . <p> " La Bonne Cuisine " by Madame E. Saint-Ange , translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $40 ) might well be promoted as the gift for the serious cookbook lover who has everything . <p> First published in France in 1927 , this book was and still is the go-to manual of the French home kitchen . Though far more sophisticated in its reach , it 's to French cooks what " Joy of Cooking " has been to generations of Americans . <p> Want to know how to produce molded aspic ? Turn to Mme. Saint-Ange . Not sure how to skin a rabbit ? Madame will guide your knife . Hankering for an old-fashioned Mont-Blanc ? Madame will help you make this " family dessert par excellence . " <p> This book , in its nearly 80 years of prominence , has never been translated into English before . Aratow , a cofounder with Alice Waters and starting chef at Berkeley 's Chez Panisse , has done a yeoman 's job putting this into elegant English and adding American measurements to the original metrics . He did not attempt to give Fahrenheit degrees in place of Madame 's elaborate explanations of what constitutes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , timed , so you know that madeleines will take one hour , while duck a la Villageoise , suitable for a duck that 's past the first flush of youth , will take 2 1/2 hours . <p> " Mastering the Art of French Cooking  --  the 40th Anniversary Edition " by Julia Child , Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck ( Alfred A. Knopf , 717 pages , $40 ) is a faithful reproduction of the book that changed the way America cooks and eats . <p> With a lengthy foreword written by Child ( who died in 2004 ) that explains both her own and the book 's culinary development , this is a faithful replica of the 1961 original , right down to the fleur de lys cover . About the only deviations are additions made in the 1983 reissue , which incorporated utensils and products not available when the book was written : the food processor , nonstick cookware and reformulated flours and cooking chocolate . <p> Otherwise , you can still practically hear Child 's throaty yet high-pitched , " Bon appetit ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glezer ( Artisan , 236 pages , large-format soft cover , $22.95 ) is a handsomely illustrated , less costly version of " Artisan Baking Across America , " which was published in 2000 . <p> Glezer , a professional baker and teacher who has won both James Beard and International Association of Culinary Professionals awards , modified recipes gleaned from artisanal bakers across America for this book , which identifies recipes by their degree of difficulty . <p> The recipes , written in the style usually employed for professional books , leave nothing to guess work . However , even the simpler recipes demand dedication  --  great for devoted bread lovers and bakers , but not for the bread machine crowd . <p> " The Complete Idiot 's Guide to Feeding Your Baby &; Toddler " by Elizabeth M. Ward ( Alpha , 313 pages paperback , $16.95 ) is chock-full of health and safety advice by this seasoned nutrition consultant/writer . She offers advice on such diverse subjects as microwave safety and eating out with your toddler . <p> The recipes  --  some no more than improvements on store-bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in many instances lend themselves to meals for the whole family .
