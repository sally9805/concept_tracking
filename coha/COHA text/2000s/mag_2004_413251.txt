China Embraces Sustainability-One City at a Time // When China announced last November that it would impose strict new fuel-economy standards for small cars and minivans , it was only one sign that the worlds most populated country is headed down a more sustainable path-while the U.S. moves in the other direction . " Chinas economic development is happening so fast that it 's suffering in 40 years what the U.S. suffered over 150 years , " says Rick Schulberg , director of the China-US . Center for Sustainable Development . Chinese cities choke under thick clouds of smog . But when it comes to the government 's newly aggressive pursuit of sustainable policies ( and enthusiastic notice in the official press ) , Schulberg says China beats the U.S. hands down . One of the best places to view sustainability , the Chinese way , is in Suzhou , a rapidly expanding city of 2.2 million people located just 40 miles from Shanghai . In the first place , the city provides a textbook case of China 's rapid and lucrative expansion . Last year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion ; this year it 's $27 billion . In 2003 alone , Suzhou has attracted an estimated $5.3 billion in foreign investment . Photograph China 's Suzhou is trying to transform itself into a sustainsble city , but many substantial challenges remain-including the loss of agricultural land . // In the 21st century , Suzhou is one huge construction zone . As residents grumble about the disruptions to their daily lives , government officials are investing billions of dollars in massive public works projects : building ring highways , widening roads and alleyways , laying more than 50 miles of sewage and rainwater pipes , landscaping the city 's myriad canals , renovating and building housing complexes and breaking ground on the first of four planned light rail and subway lines . To the west and east of the city , where two industrial parks are growing by nine miles a year , centuries-old villages are being bulldozed to make room for 20-story apartment buildings , foreign-owned mega-corporations , landscaped parks and western-style subdivisions . " Development , " reads a Suzhou billboard , " is an Immutable Truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go before environmental protection measures , technology and public awareness catch up with the city 's booming economy , especially when it comes to the commandeering of agricultural lands by the special development zones . But as one of 10 nationally designated " model environmental cities , " Suzhou also points to a second wave of Chinese urbanization-one that is n't inextricably linked to social and ecological devastation . Indeed , sustainability has become something of a mantra in Suzhou . Many of its green initiatives-such as relocating polluting industries outside of the city ( away from waterways ) , and a pilot project requiring local taxis to run on natural gas-move beyond comparable strategies in the United States . " One of our goals is to build an eco-city , " says Suzhou Mayor Yang Weize , pulling out his business card , printed on recycled paper . " With rapid growth in industrialization and population comes great responsibility to pursue environmentally friendly development . We should not use the land that belongs to the next generations . " With a 2,500-year history , Suzhou is one of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line a network of canals . The city is internationally renowned for its classical gardens and silk and embroidery industries-a combination of history , culture and greenery that officials say makes Suzhou the perfect place to model a livable community . " We are a tourism city , so we want to keep the city beautiful , " says Wang Cheng Wu , vice director of the Environmental Protection Bureau . Government officials say Suzhou 's top priorities are to develop a public transportation and alternative energy infrastructure and to continue ongoing clean-up of the city 's polluted air and waterways . Today , only 25 percent of the city 's residential wastewater is treated before being dumped in the canals . That figure will triple by 2005 , when the city adds capacity and builds new sewage treatment plants . As for air pollution-progress in industrial clean-up is now up against the automobile . Five years ago , there were 30,000 cars in Suzhou . Today , there are 150,000 , with an additional 150 being sold every day . " Because the government encouraged private enterprise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Jiang Renjie , vice mayor of transportation . Beginning to reverse policies encouraging residents to buy automobiles-known here as " city babies " - Suzhou is now hyping its comprehensive light rail project . " We understand that rail is a public facility and at first it will lose money , " Jiang says of the $13 billion project . The increase in land prices along the rail lines , he said , will eventually pay for the project . Evidence of Suzhou 's livability includes the seven-story height limit on buildings in the city 's center , the " water is the peoples resource " signs in hotels and restaurants , and the solar water heaters vendors hawk outside the Peoples Department Store . Recyclers pay or barter with residents to pick up their newspapers , bottles and styrofoam . The government is phasing out gasoline-powered motorcycles by the year 2007 , and there are plans for a network of battery exchange and disposal centers to serve the burgeoning electric bicycle/moped market . If there is one fundamental contradiction associated with China 's sustainable development , it 's the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzhou , the city 's National New and Hi-Tech Development Zone ( SND ) and the Suzhou Industrial Park ( SIP ) are forcing relocation of hundreds of farmers and paving over hundreds of square miles of green space . Over the next few years , the SND will grow from 20 to 99 square miles , overtaking four villages . Because China did n't create a Ministry of Land and Resources until 1998 , says Schulberg , the country 's land use and preservation policies are behind the curve compared to air and water pollution clean-up . In Suzhou , officials admit that the idea of an urban growth boundary , to preserve agricultural lands , has yet to penetrate the civic consciousness . Still , SND and SIP have won numerous national and international environmental awards . And inside the SND is an " environmental business incubator , " made up of 50 small R &D; firms . According to Yang , the next step for Suzhou is to develop a recycling infrastructure . China took a step in that direction this year , when it enacted a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a " circular " ( recycling ) economy . And what does Yang think of Bush administration environmental policies ? " China , " he says diplomatically , " should not make the same mistakes as the United States . " <p>
