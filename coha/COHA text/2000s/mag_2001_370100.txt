Sometime in the next 10 weeks , surgeons will remove the heart from a dying cardiac patient and replace it with the device seen at right  --  the first fully implantable , entirely self-contained mechanical heart . The $75,000 pump is a technological tour de force . Fashioned of titanium and plastic , it is powered by a wallet-size battery pack that transmits energy to a coil under the skin . Patients should be able to walk , shower , even return to work  --  as long as they recharge every four hours . AbioMed hopes to install more if the experimental design works reliably and delivers good quality of life . But the company has a long way to go to meet the demand of the 100,000 Americans who die each year waiting for a heart , any heart . <P>  --  By Dick Thompson
