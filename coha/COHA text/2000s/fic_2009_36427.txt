I got away with murder once , but it does n't look like that 's going to happen again . Damn . This time I did n't do it . Well , not all of it , anyway . <p> The incoming call showed up as an alert on my computer screen at almost midnight Friday night . I balled up the paper wrapper from the cold burrito I 'd called dinner and reached for the mouse . There were more than a hundred of us on the night shift , each sequestered in separate cubicles and hunched over our screens like penitents in a confessional . The room was supercooled to keep us awake . I laughed at the irony that , although it was September , it was probably still ninety degrees outside in the Arizona desert . <p> According to the information on the screen , the client 's name was Markson and he was driving a 2007 Cadillac Seville . The HandsOn service he 'd signed up for included automatic notification to the call center if his air bag had been triggered . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emergency in the vehicle ? " <p> A muffled response . Coughing . He was probably still patting back the doughy folds of air bag that had assaulted him , reeling from the sting of the high-powered blast of the nylon bag on his cheeks and chest . His face would be dusted with white powder from the explosion . His nose might be broken . <p> " I 'm all right . " More coughing . " Just got rear-ended . " <p> " Is anyone in your car injured ? Do you want me to call an ambulance ? " It must have been quite a hit ; rear-enders rarely set off the air bag . <p> There was something like a groan . Then the metal-on-metal snick of a car door shutting . <p> " No , I 'm okay . I 'll check with the other guy . " <p> Another car door opened and shut , the sound closer this time . <p> " Did n't you see . . . " Markson 's voice trailed off in the distance . <p> The map on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weird . The call center was responsible for a thousand-mile section from Southern California to East Texas . Funny to get a call from just down the road . <p> The blinking cursor showed Darren Markson 's car near Agua Caliente Wash on the east side of town . The " hot water " in the name of the arroyo was pure wishful thinking ; it would only see water during the monsoon runoffs . Probably not even a paved road out there , if the map markings were right . More desert than city , really . The creosote would be taller than the Cadillac 's windows . <p> The sound of scuffling came through my earpiece . I pushed the plastic ear bud tight to my head in concentration . Panting . A soft thud . <p> " I told you . . . " A deeper voice , it carried the hot , dusty smell of Mexico in the slurred bridge between the words . Almost " toll Jew . " <p> Something slammed against nearby metal , then the sound of breaking glass . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . English as a first language . Beer as a second . <p> Deep , fight-for-air panting . Heavy thuds of elbows or boots against the Cadillac 's solid metal door . A long exhaled breath . Then silence . A kicked pebble ricocheted off metal as someone moved away . <p> " Mr. Markson ? Mr. Markson ! Are you all right ? " <p> The silence was louder than the voices had been . <p> Whatever was going on , it required the cops . I called the 911 operator in Tucson . In most cases , I 'd make the connection and then let the client and 911 operator talk directly to each other , but Markson seemed to have his hands full right now . <p> " This is HandsOn Emergency dispatcher Jessie Dancing . One of our clients is having some trouble . He 's been rear-ended out near Agua Caliente Wash , just north of Soldier Trail . " <p> " Give me the details on the car . " <p> " It 's a white Cadillac Seville , Arizona plates , David-Edward-Nora Zero Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now I 've lost contact with Mr. Markson . " <p> " We 'll send a patrol car . " <p> I gave her my number and hung up , then flipped back to the open communications channel with Markson 's car . If it was a fight , who 'd started it ? Markson or the guy who 'd crashed into him ? And I thought I 'd heard three voices . <p> There was movement now  --  the susurration of fabric on fabric . And something that sounded like the glove box opening then clicking shut again . <p> " Mr. Markson ? Are you okay ? " <p> A grunted acknowledgment , then silence . The connection had gone dead . <p> I zapped an audio copy of the Markson conversation over to Mad Cow . Madeleine Cowell was her real name , but I treasured the friendship that allowed me to use the shortened honorific . She was on the concierge team tonight  --  the HandsOn operators that made hotel and restaurant reservations for clients  --  not the emergency dispatch group . Take a listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to her cubicle and ask her myself , but this way I did n't have to leave my computer screen unattended . <p> Mad Cow 's return e-mail popped into view . Is this going to be one of the Dumb Questions ? Mad Cow and I had adapted comedian Bill Engvall 's " Here 's Your Sign " skits to life at HandsOn . You know the ones . " Tire go flat ? " " No . The other three just swelled right up on me . " The current pick for the dumbest incoming call was the guy who phoned last week and asked if I could tell him if his car was running . <p> Not this time . I thought this guy was in trouble , but I 'm not sure . <p> I thought it sounded like a couple of guys at a kegger , she answered . <p> Maybe she was right . Maybe I 'd imagined the threat in those voices . <p> I tried to put the sounds in the most positive light . Say Mark-son wandered into this patch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow got tapped by another car that was trying to help push him out . The " I told you " and sounds of a scuffle could just be a couple of guys trying to dislodge a car from deep sand . <p> But I could n't get around the third voice . The one that had said " you lying sack of " something . That made it more serious than a couple of guys straining their calf muscles and debating whose insurance was going to cover the damage . <p> Now that Markson 's first call had been disconnected I could n't initiate another call to his car  --  well , not legally . Our customers frowned on the notion that we might listen in whenever we wanted to . <p> His personal cell phone information was listed on the screen , too . I listened through five rings and an even-tempered voicemail greeting , then left my number for him to call back . <p> I turned the volume all the way up and replayed his incoming call . There was a breath of desert air and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard the first time around . Markson must have had the windows open . And I heard the same words as before , although Markson 's voice sounded more nasal than I 'd first thought . Maybe the airbag really had broken his nose . <p> There were at least three voices  --  one born in a big city in the East , one nurtured on the stony mesas of Mexico , and one coming straight from a bar . And there was definitely a fight . <p> I 'd never had a call drop like this before . The satellite communications system we used was much more powerful than a regular cell phone , so it was n't likely that he 'd gone out of range or lost the connection . More likely , somebody inside the car had pushed the button to disconnect . <p> Fuck the privacy laws . I shut off the automatic recording system and pinged the car . It was still in the same spot . <p> I opened the phone channel to allow me to hear what was going on . Voices muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Spanish than English . I could n't tell how many voices or what they were saying . The sound of something dragged across brittle vegetation , and a rasping sound that I could n't place . Heavy , smacking thumps of wood against something softer . A grunt of air with the effort . A scream and a groan in response . <p> I did n't say anything , unwilling  --  even though I was almost a hundred miles away  --  to let them know that I was a witness to the scene . A coward , hiding on the other end of a satellite phone . <p> The heavy thuds continued but the moaned responses stopped . <p> I called the cops back , but did n't tell them about listening in again on Markson 's car . What good would that do anyway ? It was against the law , it was n't recorded , and I did n't have anything but a scary premonition to tell them about . <p> " Have your officers found the car yet ? " <p> " They 're on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Call me when you find him . Okay ? " <p> It was almost two a.m. before I got a call back . <p> " This is Officer Painter . " <p> Thank God it was n't anybody I knew on the Tucson PD . I 'd changed my name to Dancing  --  it was my middle name and my mother 's maiden name  --  but there had been plenty of headlines back then that included it . Hopefully this guy would n't make the connection . " Did you find the Cadillac ? " <p> " Yeah , just where you said it would be . " He sounded young . <p> " How 's Mr. Markson ? " <p> " There 's no one here . " <p> Maybe Markson got a ride from the other driver or went to get a tow truck . But he would n't have needed to ; I could have done that for him . HandsOn clients knew that . It 's why they paid as much as my monthly food bill for the service . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making me feel decades older than my thirty-two years . <p> " There 's blood everywhere .
