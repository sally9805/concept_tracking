<p> POSEIDON Rating 2 out of 4 <p> ( 2006 ; Warner Bros. ; 99 minutes ) <p> Perfunctory remake of the waterlogged 1972 original , with the same formula and hyped-up but not especially more effective special effects . With Josh Lucas , Emmy Rossum , Kurt Russell ( from left above ) , Richard Dreyfuss and others sloshing up the down staircase . If you 've never seen the original , this is an acceptable but not essential substitute . Director Wolfgang Petersen ( " Das Boot , " " The Perfect Storm " ) has made great movies involving ships , but this one is on autopilot . Rated PG-13 . ( Roger Ebert ) DVD special features : three featurettes ; the History Channel documentary " Rogue Waves . " <p> JUST MY LUCK Rating 2 out of 4 <p> ( 2006 ; Fox ; 108 minutes ) <p> Lindsay Lohan ( inset ) stars as a rising young Manhattan career girl whose good luck is amazing . Then she kisses a young stranger ( Chris Pine ) at a Masked Ball , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bad luck , and then for the rest of the movie they swap luck , and spit , in a comedy involving a real boy band named McFly and a high-powered record mogol ( Faizon Love ) . Safe , competent and bland . Lohan delivers exactly what you 'd expect , but it 's time for her to move on from this level of her career . Rated PG-13 . ( Ebert ) DVD special features : deleted and extended scenes ; behind-the-scenes look at the band McFly ; making-of featurette . <p> SAVING SHILOH Rating 3 out of 4 1/2 <p> ( 2006 ; Warner Bros. ; 90 minutes ) <p> The third and final " Shiloh " film , and fully as worthy as the others ; it deals with real problems and teaches real values , yet is exciting and entertaining . Jason Dolley stars as the growing boy Marty , Scott Wilson is the troubled neighbor , Gerald McRaney and Ann Dowd are the parents , and the movie balances comedy , adventure , and some wise insights into life . Highly recommended for family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role this time . Rated PG . ( Ebert ) DVD special features : interview with Shiloh ; " Open Your Heart " music video ; interviews with the cast and filmmakers . <p> SILENT HILL Rating 1 out of 4 1/2 <p> ( 2006 ; Sony ; 125 minutes ) <p> Disturbed by her daughter 's sleep-walking , Radha Mitchell takes her in the middle of the night to the ghost town of Silent Hill , which obsesses the girl . The town was destroyed by the fumes of still-smoldering mine fires , but it is occupied by zombie-like creatures who involve us in an absolutely impenetrable plot while roasting witches over fires and engaging in arcane and occult rituals that would make Aleister Crowley seem like a Rotarian . Based on a video game I have not played ; probably not comprehensible unless you have , and maybe not then , but the visuals are terrific . Director Christophe Gans uses graphics and special effects and grainy , scratchy film stock and surrealistic images and makes " Silent Hill " look more like an experimental art film than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features : six production diaries <p> SKETCHES OF FRANK GEHRY Rating 3 out of 4 <p> ( 2006 ; Sony ; 82 minutes ) <p> The director Sydney Pollack , an old friend of Frank Gehry , makes an informal doc about the architect and his work . We visit famous Gehry buildings , like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain , and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles , watch him at work with scissors and tape in his studio , and listen to many of his clients and a few of his critics . Engaging and refreshingly informal . Rated PG-13 .

Such was the case with his most recent film ( which he also directed ) , " The Lost City . " A nearly two-decades-long process resulted in a film that tells a very personal side of the Cuban revolution . <p> The film has just been released on DVD by Magnolia Pictures . Garcia talked to the Sun-Times about the film project so close to his heart . <p> Q. Why was this project so important to you ? <p> A. I 'm a product of this story . Emotionally , there was that element to it . The film represents a lot of stories and sentiment that have never been expressed about the Cuban revolution . And in today 's world , it 's so difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing of a very elegant and classy distributor Magnolia Pictures . <p> Q. Why take time out to talk about the DVD ? <p> A. The film basically had an arthouse-platform release . It 's hard to reach a mass audience without a major theatrical release and a $20 million advertising budget . Laughs So the auxiliary market becomes more and more important as an avenue for people to discover films . The DVD world becomes more affordable for families who might not be able to go to a cost-prohibitive movie at a local theater . Plus , we did a high-definition transfer on the DVD , so if all the tubes in the TV are working , it will look great . <p> Q. Tell me about the journey you took to get the film to the big screen . <p> A. It took me 16 years to get the movie made , from the day I got the script in 1990 to the 16-year journey to getting the financing for it . It 's an all-independent film . I poured money into it . The executive producers poured money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 35 days with only six weeks of prep . Laughs Of course , I had 16 years of prep on my own . It was all very arduous but very stimulating . <p> Q. What did you want this film to say to your own children , aside from all the stories you 've probably shared with them over the years ? <p> A. They 've been with me on this journey for 16 years . One thing my kids have witnessed through all of this is the idea that in life you have to be persistent about things  --  make sacrifices to get things done . If you have a dream , you have to fight for it , believe in it with your whole heart . <p> Q. How do you think this film made a difference in the way people understand Cuba 's history ? <p> A. I think it made a huge difference . Whenever a story is told and the masses can hear it , you garner attention and controversy , and you get people talking . It 's important that the real story be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been redesigned by the propaganda machinery of the Cuban government to the point that most Americans do n't know the real story of what went down in Cuba 40 years ago . When you watch the film , where are all the poor people ? The world believes it was the poor people who rose up . In reality , the revolution was motivated by the middle and upper classes who felt betrayed by Batista , and that is why the film tells that story . In truth , after Castro came into power , the peasants started a failed counter-revolution . The peasants backed Batista because he came from the peasant class . The film also has an unromanticized version of the Che Guevara character and what he was doing in Cuba at the time . This film does n't make up history ; it 's all based on historical fact . <p>  --  Miriam Di Nunzio Color Photo : Lindsay Lohan ; Color Photo : Poseidon ; Color Photo : Kristen Bell is " Veronica Mars " ; Color Photo : The Lost City
