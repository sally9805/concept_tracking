The Martha Stewart jokes did n't seem as funny on Friday . You know , the ones about how black-and-white stripes are in this year and how a little lemon and seltzer can remove those pesky ink stains after you 've been fingerprinted . As much as we revel in the failings of the famous , many folks figured she would never face prison . Such jests have the ring of tragedy now that she has been found guilty of obstructing justice and other crimes that all but guarantee she will end up behind bars . <P> Stewart was caught in a simple lie , the evidence so compelling and her attorney 's 20-minute defense testimony so curt  --  Martha 's too smart to do this  --  that after five weeks of testimony , a jury of eight women and four men needed less than three days to deliberate . And much of that time was spent weighing the case against her co-defendant and former Merrill Lynch stockbroker , Peter Bacanovic . He was found guilty as well on four of five counts and almost certainly will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the government was not singling out Martha Stewart for prosecution to make an example of her in an era of spectacular corporate corruption . Take him at his word . But Stewart was no ordinary Jane who traded on inside information to make a quick buck . Her tabloid celebrity , her status as a walking , talking brand name , and her role as CEO of a publicly held corporation turned what would otherwise have been a simple case into a treacherous web of legal and corporate issues . And at almost every turn , she and her advisers made the wrong move , getting her deeper and deeper in trouble . <P> In the world of criminal defense , where the first three rules are shut up , shut up , shut up , she talked to federal investigators twice . In the world of corporate public relations , where appearance is everything , she disappeared for too long . At trial , the jury seemed to resent her celebrity cheering section  --  sorry , Rosie  --  and the fact that her attorney , Robert Morvillo , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy , but the jury had spent all that time in court with her and had never been properly introduced . That 's not very Martha . <P> At the heart of the case was a stock tip that , the government alleged , allowed Stewart , once worth $1 billion , to net a measly $45,000 . Prosecutors never filed criminal insider-trading charges , though , and Stewart handed her tormentors a comparatively easy obstruction case when , as the jury decided last week , she lied to cover up why she had sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems on the eve of an adverse ruling for its cancer drug Erbitux . Stewart could probably have come clean immediately and received a slap on the wrist from the Securities and Exchange Commission ( sec ) . But by sticking to a bogus story , she turned a civil case into a criminal one . " When we first indicted this case , we said it was about lies , all about lies , " says Kelley . " And as you saw in the evidence , that 's what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec about very important matters . "
