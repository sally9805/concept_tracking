Nowhere , Wyoming <p> The frozen lake and the black vacuum sky and the dead man pleading for the return of his remaining days . <p> " There must be some kind of mistake . " <p> No . <p> " You 've got the wrong guy . " <p> No . <p> " You 're gon na pay for this . " <p> Viejo compaero , I 've paid in advance . <p> And before he can come up with any more material I unroll a line of duct tape , cut it , and place it over his mouth . <p> I step away from the car , check back up the trail . <p> Moonlight on the green Park Service hut . Snow on the dogwoods . No new tire tracks . <p> Apart from me and my confederates , no one 's been here in days , probably weeks . I close the BMW 's trunk and take off my ski mask . He kicks at the side panels with his soles but the muffied protests cease after a couple of minutes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring out an orange . <p> I stare at it obsessively for a moment , but the color and the smell are making my head spin . I return it to the coat . <p> " An orange , " I say to myself with a smile . <p> I breathe the crisp December air , shiver . <p> I open the driver's-side door . <p> The seat . The key . The heat . <p> I rummage in the bag and find Paco 's Mexican cigarettes . <p> I partially close the door and look at the BMW 's rocket ship display . Which of these is the clock ? Ah , there it is next to the GPS : 6:02 a.m . At least a one-hour wait . We wo n't go onto the ice until sunup  --  no point in taking unnecessary risks in the dark . <p> I light the cigarette , inhale the loose , sweet tobacco , and let it coat my lungs . <p> The smoke warms my insides to such an extent that when I exhale I feel empty , scared . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke . <p> Keep it there . <p> Another sad exhalation . Two more iterations but the cumulative effect is the opposite of what I 'm expecting , making me jittery , on edge . <p> I turn on the interior light and examine the pack . A comical English explorer in shorts and pith helmet . Faros . Had them before  --  when I was a teenager Mexican cigarettes were the only affordable luxury you could get . Uncle Arturo managed to find Marlboros , but my father said that Faros and Rivas were just as good . I must be so nervous that I 'm way beyond their power to relax me . <p> At the bottom of the Faros packet , there is , however , something that looks like a fat joint . I take it out and sniff it . Grade-A narc from Canada  --  Paco must have stolen it somehow . Maybe the night of the party . <p> It would be very tempting to light it up , but I should probably save that for after . One of those and I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Check the clock : 6:06 and still as dark as ever . <p> A breeze cuts through the door and I pull it fully closed . In brittle Eurotrash an annoyed disembodied voice tells me to fasten my seatbelt . I try to ignore it but it grows increasingly demented . " Fasten seatbelt , fasten seatbelt , fasten seatbelt . " <p> I fool the computer by clicking and quickly unclicking the belt . <p> " Seatbelt secured , " the computer sighs with relief . <p> Clock says 6:08 . <p> I put the cigarettes in the backpack and kill the headlights . <p> Quick scan through the radio stations . Country . Religious . Country . News . Country . Religious . I nix the radio and max the heat . <p> Nothing to do now but wait . <p> I wait . <p> A gust rustling the tree branches along the ridge . <p> A starlit vapor trail . <p> Kicking from inside the trunk . <p> The radio again , a Nebraska station playing polka . A ten-thousand-watt Jesus station out of Laramie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finish it , wipe my fingerprints from the butt , and throw it out the window . <p> 6:15 . <p> I leave the window open and turn everything off . <p> And sit there . <p> Sit . <p> As the day meditates . <p> Time passes and finally a hint of morning in the black distance and above me a blue , distilled silence as night switches off its stars . <p> Here goes . <p> From the passenger 's seat I unwrap the ROAD CLOSED  --  SUBSIDENCE DANGER sign I stole yesterday in Fairview . <p> Wo n't be enough to fool a ranger from the Park Service but it should keep away any early-morning hunters or ice fishermen . <p> I grab the Smith &amp; Wesson 9mm , get out of the car , and walk back up the trail until I find the aluminum swing gate . In the distance I can see the lights of vehicles on the highway . Big rigs , Greyhound buses , nothing that 's coming down here . I duct tape the sign to the top bar of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't look so fantastic but it 'll have to do . <p> I drag the gate through the snow , close it , and lock it with the padlock I 've specifically brought for this purpose . You 're going to need to be pretty determined to come down this road now . <p> I take a few steps to the side and admire my handiwork . <p> Maybe a good idea to get rid of all the footprints . <p> I grab a tree branch and brush over the area on my side of the gate . <p> That 's better . <p> Not likely that man or beast is going to come by at this time of the morning , but my business is going to take a while and this should help deter the curious . <p> I wipe away all the tire tracks and footprints until I reach the bend in the road , then I toss the branch and return to the BMW . <p> I get back inside and warm my hands over the vents . 6:36 . Better get a move on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun , the handcuffs key , the gloves , and the ski mask inside . <p> I get out of the car and close the door . <p> Dawn is a smear on the eastern horizon and light is beginning to illuminate the low clouds in alternating bands of orange and gold . <p> Ok . <p> I shoulder the backpack and walk out onto the lake , bend down and examine the ice . <p> About twenty , thirty millimeters thick . Good enough , I imagine . <p> I trudge back to the car , open the backpack , and put on the gloves and ski mask . <p> A click of the button and the trunk pops open . <p> His eyes are wild , his naked body Pollocked with mud , oil , and paint flecks . His legs covered in yellow bruises . He 's been trying to kick open the emergency release lever with his knees . <p> He 's having trouble breathing . I see that the duct tape is partially covering his nostrils . The sort of clumsy mistake that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . <p> " Bastard , " he says , and spits at me . <p> Save your strength , if I were you , compaero . <p> I lift his legs out and then grab him by the arm and heft him from the trunk onto the embankment . I shove him facedown into the snow , take the knife , and cut through the duct tape at his ankles . I step away from him and remove the Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P from my jacket pocket . <p> He gets to his feet , but he ca n't do anything with his hands still cuffed behind his back . <p> I waggle the gun at him to make sure that he sees it . <p> " Now what ? " he says . <p> I point at the lake . <p> " I 'm freezing . I want my clothes . I 'm freezing to death . " <p> I bring the 9mm up to his navel and press it against his bruised stomach . <p> The gun and the ski mask are iconic images of terror . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of pressure . <p> " All right , " he says . <p> I turn him and push him gently in the direction of the lake . <p> He mutters something , shakes his head , and walks through the frozen snow to the lakeshore . <p> His body is pale , almost blue white . And he 's a big man . Six foot four , two hundred and fifty pounds , none of it fat . He was a college football player back in the day and he 's kept himself in shape . Five miles on the treadmill each morning and rugby training every Wednesday with the Gentlemen of Aspen . <p> More grumbling , and he stops when his soles touch the ice . He hesitates . The snow was full of air and not too frigid but the ice is dry , . at , and sticky . It 's cold enough to burn . <p> " What do you want me to do ? " <p> I 'm about to speak for the first time but the words die on my lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . <p> " On this ? " <p> I nod and extend the gun . <p> " Ah shit , " he says but begins walking . <p> It 's full light now . <p> The sun advancing over the plains . The moon a fading scar . <p> Beautiful . <p> The lake . The trees . <p> Frost crystals . <p> Voleries of geese . <p> Fish in trance . <p> " Aow ! " he says . <p> Vapor lock . His soles are stuck and he shudders to a halt . Momentum is the key . I give him a shove.His back tenses at my touch and he does n't move . <p> I tap him with the gun . <p> We begin again . <p> But the sensation of his powerful shoulder muscle through the glove has made me nervous . <p> I 'm going to have to be very careful when I give him the hammer . <p> In his freshman year at college he had a charge of assault and battery dismissed ( so Ricky thinks ) through the influence of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jaw , but that never came to anything because it was on the football field . <p> He 's strong . He could snap me in half . Would too , given half a chance . <p> " How much farther ? What is this ? " he asks and stops again . <p> I push him . <p> Although he moves , there 's a little jaunt in his step that makes me think he 's up to something . <p> Got to be careful in spades . <p> " What 's with the silent treatment , buddy ? Do you even understand English ? Are you mute ? " <p> He turns to look at me . <p> " Huh ? Get me ? What are they paying you ? I 'll give you ten times what they 're paying you . What 's your price ? Name it . Just name it . I 've got the money . A lot of money . Everyone has their price . Tell me what it is . " <p> Can you run back time ? Can you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What have you done with my clothes ? I want my clothes . I want my goddamn clothes ! " he shouts , furious , stubborn . <p> Naked in , amigo , and perhaps if things do n't go well , naked out . <p> Even so , when the gun waggles he keeps walking . <p> " What is this ? I want my clothes ! " <p> The echo back over the lake opens the floodgates . <p> " This is insane ! This is crazy ! " he yells . " You ca n't shoot me , you can't.You ca n't shoot me . You ca n't . I have n't done anything . You got the wrong man.This is a goddamn misunderstanding . " <p> I 'm not going to shoot you . That would be far too easy . That would not give us sufficient comfort in the long years ahead . <p> " Listen to me , listen to me . I know you 're not mute and I know you can hear me . Say something . Speak . You think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to speak . I 'm ordering you to speak . Speak to me ! " <p> You want part of it ? How about this : enshrined within the Colonial Spanish penal code is the Latin maxim talem qualem , which means you take your victim as you find him . American cops call it the eggshell skull rule . Slap someone with a delicate cranium , break it , and they 'll still charge you with murder . Talem qualem . Take your victim as you find him . In other words , be careful who you kill . Be careful who you kill , friend . <p> " Madness . This is madness . You 've obviously made some kind of mistake . I 'm not loaded . You want to go to Watson , he 's worth a billion . I 'll show you . I 'll show you . He 's got a van Gogh , a Matisse . Him , not me . Dammit , talk to me ! Who do you think I am ? What is this ? Who do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . <p> It 's who I am that 's the mystery . What am I doing here ? That one I still have n't figured out . <p> He stamps his heel into the ice , . exes his shoulder , turns again . <p> " This is crazy . You do n't . . . Have you any idea what you 've got yourself into ? Do you know who you 're dealing with ? Ok , I 'm no goddamn Cruise but let me tell you something , I 'll be missed . They 'll come looking for me . Are you listening ? Take that thing off your head . I do n't know what they told you . I do n't know what you think you 're doing but you 're making a big mistake , pal . Big mistake . Biggest mistake of your whole life . That 's it , is n't it ? You do n't know who I am , this is just a job to you , is n't it ? Is n't it ? Well , let me hit you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-changing error . " <p> His confidence is starting to return . It did n't take long . His default position is the black rider , the boss , the center of the Ptolemaic universe . I prefer that . <p> " This has gone on too far . Way too far for a practical joke . Right now you 're doing permanent damage to the soles of my feet . I 'll see you in court for this . " <p> He still does n't get it . He still does n't see why we 're here . <p> " Listen to me , pal , you have no idea what you 're mixed up in . You do n't . Name a sum of money . Go on , just name it . A hundred thousand dollars ? Two hundred thousand dollars ? How about a cool half mil ? Half a mil . Easy money . Easy money . Come on , buddy . You and me . We 'll pull one over on ' em.We 'll show them . Come on , whaddya say ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man , you can see the angles , we 'll play ' em together . " <p> Oh , compaero , is everything about you fake ? A performance ? Where did you learn to talk like that ? The movies ? TV ? Is n't there anything real under that sheath of skin ? <p> I slide the breech back on the M&amp;P and it makes a satisfying clunk . <p> He continues shuffling , but only for a few paces . <p> " Come on , man , " he says , and turns , and he 's so fast I do n't even see the drop kick coming . <p> He jumps with both feet and crashes into my stomach . <p> The wind is knocked out of me and the gun goes flying . Both of us go down onto the ice with a crash . He falls on me , his thighs crunching against my ribs . <p> Water and a big fissure forming under my back . <p> He pivots on top of me , and although his hands are still cuffed he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ski mask at my chin , his breath reeking of booze and fear . <p> I make a fist and thump him so hard the first blow probably breaks his nose . The next gets him in his left eye , and the sideways kick to the crotch is the clincher . He doubles up in agony and I push the writhing mass of naked flesh away from me . <p> I get to my feet , retrieve the gun , suck O2 . <p> I look nervously at the crack under my feet . I stand there for a few beats but it does n't widen . <p> " Jesus , " he says . <p> Jesus is right . That was really something . <p> We both could easily have gone right through the surface . The hammer in my backpack would have taken me down to the lake bottom and if the shock had n't sent me into cardiac arrest , the current would probably have taken me away from the crack and up under unbroken ice . And if I had n't been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd gotten through somehow , I 'd have been too exhausted to get out of the water . I 'd have frozen to death in about half an hour . Mary , Mother of God , that would have been too perfect . It almost would have been worth it , just for that . What a wonderful , circular , karmic joke on me . <p> Yes . <p> I underestimated you , friend . And if I was a better person I 'd let you go . <p> More deep breaths , hard , until I feel that I 'm balanced again , poised between flight and flight . <p> Behind me the startled ravens stop squawking and resume their perches . <p> He is gasping for air , blood bubbling in his mouth . <p> After all the excitement we 'll both need another minute . He returns my gaze and , observing the gun , backs away crabwise , trying to make it to the shore . Painful to watch : hands resisting the desiccated ice , heels dragging . <p> Squeak , squeak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squeak . <p> I walk to him . <p> " No , " he says . <p> His ass sticks to the ice . He rips it free and the crab walk recommences . It 's so pathetic I 'm starting to feel bad . I point the gun at his stomach . <p> " No , " he repeats in a whisper . <p> Nooo . His breath a ghost that vanishes like all ghosts . Desperation in those red , coke crash eyes . I go behind him and lug him to his feet . Ice-burned skin . Human skin . <p> Sickening , but not much farther now . <p> " Listen to me , buddy , I can make you rich . I can get you money . A lot of money . Millions . Do you understand ? Millions of dollars . Goddammit ! Why do n't you understand , what 's the matter with you ? Millions of dollars ? Do you speak English ? Do you understand the goddamn English language ? " <p> I do . It was my major . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a mistake . A life-altering  --  I have men , they 'll find me , and when they do I would n't like to be in your shoes . " <p> Better my shoes than no shoes . <p> " You just do n't know who you 're dealing with . You have no idea . " <p> What next ? You 're connected ? You 're high up in the mob ? Your movements are tracked by drones piloted by the CIA ? <p> Just a few more steps : one , two , three , four . <p> There , we 're about thirty meters out now , which is far enough . <p> I give him the universal " stop " sign and signal him to lie down . <p> He shakes his head . I place the barrel of the gun against his heart . <p> Still he does n't obey . <p> I walk behind him and kick him in the left calf . His knees buckle and I push his head down , shoving his face against the ice . His body goes limp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket , remove the handcuff key , unlock one wrist , and quickly get out of his way . I grab the gun again and wait . For a moment he does n't believe that I 've unlocked him , but then when he sees that he 's completely free he gets to his feet and begins rubbing the circulation back into his wrists . <p> Keeping the gun on him I place the backpack in front of me and unzip the central pocket . I take out the sledgehammer and slide it to him over the ice . <p> He looks with astonishment at the vicious maple-handled , steel-headed five-kilo sledgehammer . <p> " What 's this for ? " he asks . <p> I point at the ice . <p> His face shows incomprehension , but then he gets it . " You want me to make a hole in the ice ? " <p> I nod . <p> He picks up the hammer . <p> As I knew it would , my heart starts to race . This is by far the riskiest part of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm dead . <p> Maybe we 'll get that sweet karmic ending after all . <p> He 's got a fantastic weapon , he 's strong , he 's angry , he 's free . <p> He holds all the cards but one . <p> Information . <p> He does n't know that the gun is empty . <p> He stares at my masked face for a moment , smiles unnervingly , and tightens his grip on the maple . <p> He looks like Pitt at the party , like Thor at Ragnarok  --  the hammer , the ice , the bloody face , the blond locks . <p> I raise the Smith &amp; Wesson and hold it in both hands . I sight him with the utterly useless gun . <p> " And what if I do n't ? " he says . <p> I nod as if to say , Try it . <p> " This is totally insane , " he mutters . He shakes his head in disgust . " What kind of a man are you ? " <p> No kind of a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown eyes . <p> " Hell with it then , " he says and violently smashes the hammer into the ice . The first hit cracks the surface . The second makes a hole the size of a football . The third makes a large pancake-size fissure that I can easily lift out . <p> I put my hand up to stop him . Then with the . at of my palm I signal him to drop the sledge . <p> It would be easier to start speaking now , to actually tell him stuff , but I 'm reluctant to reveal that much of myself until he 's completely where I want him to be . <p> " You want me to lose the hammer ? " <p> I nod . <p> " How about I lose it in your head ? " <p> He looks at me and then the gun and he lets the sledgehammer fall out of his hands . Keeping the 9mm on point I walk behind him and push him back to the ground . The car ride and the cold and this last piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice like an old friend . <p> I put the snout of the gun on his neck and let him feel it there for a moment ; then I take his hands and place them on his lower back ; before he can try anything I quickly recuff him . <p> And that 's that . It 's over . No escape . If he gives me the wrong answers he 's dead . <p> I lay the gun on the ground , walk to the hole , pick up the ice debris , and throw it out . I widen the hole a little with the sledgehammer and then toss it away as far as I can . <p> Before he has the time to think I drag him backward by the cuffs into the ice hole . Takes all my strength , which is n't much . When his legs touch the water , he begins to buck wildly but I 've got enough momentum now to finish the job . <p> I shove the rest of him into the freezing lake . <p> Almost immediately his body begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine it 's like being electrocuted . <p> For a moment his legs stop kicking and he sinks beneath the water , but then  --  thankfully  --  he fights his way back to the surface . <p> Treading water , looking at me . His legs are powerful and he 's so strong I suppose he could keep this up for half an hour or even forty-five minutes if I assisted him a little from time to time . <p> I sit next to him on the ice and open the backpack . <p> I take out the Ziploc bag I found in his nightstand . Inside there 's six rolls of hundreds , a key of scag , and enough crank to animate half the corpses in Colorado . I suppose it 's some kind of emergency treasure . About a hundred thousand in currency and convertibles . <p> I catch his eye and make sure that he sees what I 'm doing . I place the heavy bag in the water in front of him and we watch it sink to the bottom of the lake . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . <p> In fact I can illuminate this even better for you now that you 're cuffed and in the goddamn hole . I take off the ski mask . <p> Recognition dawns immediately , recognition and amazement . <p> Good . And now for the most important part of all . This is the bit I 've been dreaming about . For this I want your full attention . <p> I lean forward , crawl toward him , and turn his face so that he 's looking at me . When his eyes meet mine , I raise the gun , tip it vertical to show him the empty chamber , and then I click the magazine release and show him the empty clip . <p> Do you get it now , compaero ? <p> Who did this to you ? A girl . A wetback armed only with an unloaded pistol . At any time you could have run away and , my friend , when you had that hammer you could have ended this whole thing . But you did n't . She bluffed you out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the gun , says nothing . <p> I 'm a little let down . <p> Where 's the . reworks ? The fury ? <p> Nothing . Well , you ca n't have everything . <p> He saw and he knows . <p> His legs continue to kick furiously but his feet , in the cold currents of the hypolimnion , are beginning to tire already . <p> I nod , slide back from the hole , stand , retrieve the hammer , and put it , the <p> gun , and the ski mask into the backpack . <p> " Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! " he begins to yell . <p> I scan the shore . Nobody . <p> " Help me ! " he screams , his eyes darting madly . Expecting what ? Duck hunter ? Ice fisherman ? <p> No . No one comes here in the winter , and just to be on the safe side I 've put up a sign , I 've locked the gate , I 've wiped the footprints . <p> " Help me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang for a moment and then freeze onto the ice . <p> His lips are turning blue . His skin , red . <p> He 's whispering . I can barely hear . I lean in . " Bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch , bitch , " he says . <p> Words are finite . The set of all the words that will ever be spoken is small and the subset of each human 's allotment is tiny . These could be your last . Is this really what you want to leave the Earth proclaiming ? <p> " Bitch . Bitch . Bitch . Bitch . " <p> Apparently so . Well , you 're going to have to give me more than that if you want to get out of this alive . <p> After a minute the mantra changes but not by much : " Bitch , bitch , bitch , get you , bitch , you 'll see , wo n't be fun for you , get you , teach you , yeah , bitch . " <p> But then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got no goddamn shame . " <p> That 's more like it . Where did that line come from ? Shame  --  how old-fashioned . Hector says that shame was one of the casualties of the twentieth century . Hector comes out with a lot of stuff like that . Hector says that Cuba is a woman 's mouth , her lips squeezed together in a grimace , bruised and twisted at one end from all the beatings she 's taken over the years . You 'd dig Hec , maybe we could get him a job in Hollywood . A character actor . A cigarchomping Miami cop . Do they still make cop movies ? <p> " No shame , get you , bitch . . . " <p> But you 're wrong . I have no morals , no husband , no children , but shame I have by the bucketload . <p> He starts to scream again . <p> " Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! " <p> The duct tape is still in the backpack . I could cover his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! " <p> In a minute he wears himself out . <p> His teeth chattering . His eyes closing . <p> I pull out the pack of Faros and put two in my mouth . I flip the Zippo and light both . I offer him one of the cigarettes . He nods and I put it between his lips . It 'll help him . In a couple of seconds the dissolved nicotine molecules will be . ring neurotransmitters that 'll release small quantities of dopamine into his brain . As the cold starts to get to him , blood will retreat from his extremities and his brain will become overoxygenated , perhaps releasing more dopamine and endorphins . The feeling will not be unpleasant . <p> I put my hand beneath his armpit and lift him a little . <p> He draws on the cigarette and nods a thank-you . <p> " I just g-gave up . M-man , this is ironic , it r-really is , " he says . <p> Oh , compaero , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not permitted to speak of irony , certainly not Americans like you . <p> He grins . <p> He probably thinks I 'm starting to crack , that I 'll change my mind about this business . <p> I wo n't but I am so caught up in that grisly smile and the fading blue of his eyes that I do n't see the black Cadillac Escalade idle its way to the locked gate behind us . I do n't see the doors open , I do n't see the men with guns get out . <p> I do n't see anything . <p> I 'm in this moment with this man . <p> Are you ready ? <p> Are you ready to speak the truth ? <p> Or do you want to wait until the black angel joins us on the ice ? <p> " D-d-do n't d-do this . D-do n't d-d-do this . " His voice drops half an octave , keeps the imperative , but loses the tone . " Do n't , p-please . " <p> Much more effective . <p> A call to prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants of the Muslim kingdom of Granada . We appreciate that kind of thing . <p> A call to prayer . Yes . <p> The dogwood minarets . <p> The ice lake sajadah . <p> The raven muezzins . <p> " How d-did it c-come to this ?
