Chapter One : Memory " We left Vulcan on the Fifth of Tasmeen . Since then , it has been a day of remembrance on all the great ships that survive . " Before embracing exile , Karatek had been a physicist at the Vulcan Space Institute in a ShiKahr he would never see again . Now that Vulcan was receding fast , both in fact and in memory , the Fifth of Tasmeen had become a day of meditation and reflection . Thus , it was Karatek 's duty to ask : Was it the fleet that needed the Fifth of Tasmeen , or Karatek himself ? He glanced out into the long night . Here were few stars . No planets ; therefore no new home . Beside the viewscreen were hangings woven in traditional designs . His consort had hung them in his meditation chamber to soften the severity of the bulkheads . They fluttered constantly as air circulated through the ship like blood through a heart . The air was cold . It smelled of chemicals , not the wild sweetness of the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold into blazing heat and dazzling light , shimmering off the crimson sand . Karatek focused on the gleaming crystals and bloodmetal circuits of his coronet . Of all the tasks he performed as one ofShavokh 's leaders , Karatek thought the duty of remembrance was probably the most valuable . Certainly it was the one for which he was best suited . The thought , as it always did , brought some reassurance . He had reluctantly inherited the task of command , and it still came hard to him . Most of the people he would have preferred to follow were long dead . He adjusted the coronet . His hair was brittle from the air , even more arid than that of Vulcan . It had begun to gray earlier than it would have done on the homeworld , assuming he had managed to survive the battles that had been the Mother World 's daily lot . From years of making this record , he knew that the great green gems that were the coronet 's memory , created in an art banned by the adepts both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beat of the blood in his temples . Wrapped around the glowing crystals were fine-drawn unbreakable metal wires . Clad with bloodmetal , the wires formed intricate lattices that simultaneously ornamented the memory device and linked into his cerebral cortex through filaments almost too delicate to be felt . The tiny wounds those wires inflicted every time he set the coronet on his head stung for a moment longer as they healed . They would reopen when he removed the crown . But the pain did not matter . As Surak said , there was no pain . Certainly , there was not pain enough to interrupt the thoughts , memories , sensations , and even the emotions  --  for even after years of study of Surak 's disciplines , Karatek 's emotional control remained imperfect  --  that the memory device would capture and record for all the years of exile and afterward , when they finally found a new homeworld . If that day ever came in the long night of their exile . It was Karatek 's habit to combine meditation and memory . But the task that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tasmeen when he recalled events from the past year and sealed them in the coronet 's memory . " I could make the calculation , if I chose , of today 's date on the Mother World . At our current speed , while 3.9 years have passed on board this ship and its consorts , 25.86 years have passed on Vulcan . Obviously , today is not the Fifth of Tasmeen back on Vulcan . Although some who follow Surak deem hope to be illogical , I can not agree : Surak might have been ruthless , but he was never cruel . Therefore , I believe it is not illogical to hope that the homeworld has survived and that finally  --  after all the bloodshed  --  it may live long and prosper , as Lady Mitrani wished us . She may still be alive . I hope she is well . " On all the ships that have survived thus far , other memories occupy us today . It is with grief that I must record the loss of seven ships . " Karatek took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage before he made himself pour the memories of that loss into the coronet 's glowing green gems . He recalled faces that , from now on , he would see only in memory , and knew the crown would preserve them for all times . Tears blurred his vision before the veils flicked across his eyes , preventing precious moisture from evaporating in the dry air of this chamber where art from home fluttered in a ceaseless artificial breeze . Those ships that died had acted in error . They had paid for their error with their lives . And Karatek had failed to dissuade them . Their blood was on his hands . In the last council among all the ships that traveled like a caravan across the Forge through this greater desert of stars , Karatek had heard a propulsion model advocated by an unlikely , possibly unholy , alliance of technocrat party functionaries with two of the adepts from Gol . Much to the council 's not-well-concealed astonishment , they had even been joined by some of the te-Vikram who had found themselves trapped on board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be , it just had to be , the last civil war on Vulcan . The new propulsion model , admittedly , had at first been intriguing . It fused technology with the arts of the mind in a way that Gol adepts had once condemned as blasphemy . Those same scruples , Karatek recalled , had caused the priestess at the shrine atop Mount Seleya to hand over to Surak the crown of memory that Karatek now held . But , ultimately , the new system was bad politics and worse science , Karatek had decided . He had refused to consider it for Shavokh . And he had argued against its implementation on any of the ships with all the authority of his training as a physicist and his experience as a propulsion engineer . What had become of the logic of the adepts who advocated its use ? For them to abandon their former scruples  --  Karatek shuddered . Seven ships went against the council 's vote and installed the new propulsion system . How triumphantly they must have raced ahead , Karatek imagined . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fleet , we shall tell Karatek how wrong he was ! And then , we shall bring the ships home . Those ships had raced off like boys who dashed ahead of their friends on a dare , looking back to laugh or jeer , only to find that their mad dash forward had taken them to the le-matya 's den or to the edge of a precipice with no time to stop , no rock or root to grab to save themselves . They had left themselves no margin for error and therefore no escape . Karatek shook his head : how illogical it was of him to seek to deny his memory and the evidence of his own ship 's sensors . But , in strict honesty , let the coronet record his denial too . Something hot trickled down his temple : he had jarred loose one of the filaments that bound him to the coronet . In the most ancient rites , blood had been used as a sacrifice to appease the katras of travelers lost in the desert , spirits blowing on the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board this ship , traveled with Surak . Though your journey now is greater , that is still no reason to lose control , he chided himself . The coronet would capture his self-recrimination as well as his mourning . His memories would be preserved , but what of the thoughts and emotions , even the katras of the people on board those lost ships ? For the initial acceleration trial , the Gol adepts had been linked to brother and sister adepts on other ships . Some of those adepts had burned themselves out . Some had died as hearts and blood vessels burst from the strain . Others survived , if one wished to call it life . Of the survivors , some howled , while others sat or lay soiled , mindless , and silent , a burden on family and healers who would tend them gently until their lives ' ends , for there was no desert into which they could walk , had they been able to move . And it was thought blasphemy to assist them out into the Long Night . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made their engines explode . There had always been that possibility . The minute structural weaknesses he had distrusted would , at least , have given the people within a quick , merciful , and sane death before the black hole that had opened before them sucked them into a night devoid even of stars . Perhaps if Karatek had argued more forcefully , if he had explained more clearly to Commissioner T'Partha how risky that drive was , the ships now lost to the exiles ' fleet would still be traveling alongside Shavokh across this trackless forge of stars . The catastrophe had caused some of the scientists who followed Surak to theorize that a chance  --  perhaps 1.3 percent , perhaps even less  --  existed that at least one of the ships might have survived a transit through the madness of space , light , and gravity into which they had plunged . Perhaps , if an exit were possible , such a ship might emerge in some other place , near some other star that might possess even one Minshara-class world and , in this second exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that theory were dubious : cold comfort , if logic could be considered comfort . What was , was . Karatek 's eyes scalded . This much of his own disgrace he could spare future generations , he told himself . He pulled the coronet off . A brief warmth , almost as hot as the tears he fought to suppress , spread at his temples as the filaments withdrew . His biocontrol healed the tiny wounds almost instantly . The pain of memory lingered . The coronet glowed in his hands , the flicker in the crystals almost as subtle as the whisper of micrometeorites and dust as they brushed against the ship 's hull . Useful finds of tritanium and duranium had enabled the surviving engineers to strengthen the ships ' hulls in case they had to last well beyond initial estimates of one hundred years . For all the emphasis on safety , the obsessive care the exiles took to strengthen their ships in case the journey lasted past even the most pessimistic estimates , they had made no advance that was n't accompanied by accidents . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out half of one ship 's population and exposed the remainder to radiation that would , no doubt , shorten their lives , make their deaths more painful , and reap a deadly harvest among any children they dared to have . Among the survivors had been a cadre of the fiercely independent te-Vikram , whose priest-kings had plunged Vulcan into at least three wars and constant border skirmishes in the past hundred years . A raid on the shuttles that carried the exiles to their ships had resulted in te-Vikram coming on board . They had never wanted to be there . The surviving te-Vikram had seized the opportunity of catastrophic crew loss to stage a mutiny , wrest control of the ship from its surviving crew , and turn back . Karatek had watched that ship explode as its engineers , loyal to the fleet , staged a desperate , final rebellion . He himself had trained at least two of them . In physics , not in logic . Karatek remembered the explosion as well as the pain of recalling it . The gems that were his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their depth shimmering , and he realized that his tears had fallen on them . Where is your control ? Karatek tightened his hand on the artifact . Even though crystals and metal pressed into his skin , the coronet felt agreeably warm in his hands . At the last council , a vote had been taken to decrease some elements of life support . Vulcan 's air had been thin ; it was no sacrifice to reduce oxygen content . And a slightly lower gravity actually made them feel stronger than they were and gave them greater ease in manipulating heavy engine components or hull plating . But Karatek had never quite accustomed himself to the cold . They could drape the bulkheads with weavings created here on the looms built for the workshops psychologists had deemed necessary to help ease the bleakness of the ship 's environment . They could fill compartments with art : a geode found on a mining expedition ; a ceramic representation , made by his adopted son Solor , of the shavokh for which this ship was named . They could wear warmer tunics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still cold . An incentive , of course , to find a new homeworld and find it soon . Illogical to have mixed feelings about that idea . Illogical to admit to feelings at all . " If I forget thee , O Vulcan ... " Karatek murmured . He squeezed his eyes shut , trying to form a mantra of control before resuming the coronet and the torment of memory . Sunlight on the sands outside ShiKahr , where the flanged gate had stood for millennia , where he had watched for pilgrims and caravans ever since he was a boy . Where he had seen Surak and two of his disciples emerge from the desert , take his life into their hands , and weave it , like a thread of bloodmetal , into the tapestry of their hopes and dreams for their people . A soft chime sounded . Karatek 's lips softened in what would have been , in the days before he met Surak , a smile as his consort T'Vysse slipped into his study . On this Fifth of Tasmeen , she wore the dulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But she was always beautiful to him . Karatek rose as T'Vysse entered the room . She pressed one hand to the small of her back . She was pregnant now with what would be the fourth child of her body . With the door open , he could hear shouting in the corridor outside their quarters . " Your pardon , my husband , " she said , with the impeccable manners that had been hers since childhood : the formal training of a well-born Vulcan . Their eldest daughter , dead these many years , had had similar manners , as did Sarissa , their adopted child , who combined them with the control she too had learned from Surak . By now , their grandson  --  stranded back on Vulcan with his parents in the last dreadful moments of violence before the final shuttles lifted off the Mother World  --  might well have children of his own . Children I shall never see . Descendants of my House . There was some satisfaction in knowing that his House , if nothing else , would continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts through their bond , T'Vysse stepped close to him . Karatek held out joined fingers to touch her free hand , then used their handclasp to ease her into his chair . This child-to-be , however , this child of their exile , would have everything that Karatek could provide despite the healers ' concerns about the health of a child born in the long , radiation-filled transit between star and star . Healers , like physicists , adepts , and warriors , had been wrong before . They could be wrong again . With T'Vysse present , her fingers brushing his , the tiny chamber held all the warmth of home . " Thee has word ? " he asked her , gazing into her eyes . " The shuttle awaits . Its pilot begs pardon if thy meditations were interrupted , but he asks that thee come swiftly . To avoid further controversy . " Karatek raised a brow at his wife 's choice of words . T'Vysse was a mistress of understatement . The decision taken at the last council to limit travel between ships and postpone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been unpopular . But " limit " and " postpone " were words that the exiles , like the Vulcans left so far behind them , had grown to distrust . As a result , any time a shuttle took off from any one of the ships , Karatek heard protests and charges of favoritism . If Shavokh was cold , the shuttles would be colder . Karatek had helped modify their design , diverting most of their energy to propulsion lest they fall behind the fleet and , lacking the power to catch up , be marooned alone in the night  --  another reason that councils were infrequent now . But there was another reason still , one that was barely whispered . After te-Vikram rebels had commandeered one ship , the council had calculated a 47.1 percent chance that too-easy transfers could allow factions to concentrate themselves in individual ships and gain power again . Would a te-Vikram ship willingly keep company with one crewed by Surak 's disciples or Seleyan adepts ? " I will come now , " Karatek said . He would finish the recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting . And if he did not , T'Vysse had informed him that she would take up the burden of memory . The crown had been given to him . Well enough , then : the task was his . But if he laid it down , she was a historian and logically the one to take it over  --  even if Karatek hated to see her further burdened . Logically , however , if T'Vysse inherited the burden of memory , he would not be alive to see anything at all . Draping a heavy ceremonial cloak woven in shades of muted crimsons over the dulled green of his mourning clothes , Karatek entered the larger cabin where his family spent much of their time . Solor and Sarissa waited for him there . So did Commissioner T'Partha , wrapped in an even heavier cloak of her favorite bronze , along with two members of ship 's security . Karatek remembered them well : Streon , a slim , intense man who played the flute when he was off duty , and tall , foursquare T'Via . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karatek 's old friend Commander Ivek . If no one had assassinated Ivek , he was probably many times a great-great-grandfather by now . If he were dead , well , Karatek only hoped that someone had managed to convey his katra to the Halls of Ancient Thought . Ivek had had the integrity of a man who had studied no philosophy but his duty . " An honor guard ? " Karatek asked , raising his eyebrows at T'Partha . " Commissioner , I hardly think ... " She had never been a woman for superfluous formality . Karatek knew that if he played the role of leader aboard Shavokh , he did so only with her cooperation . " There is a crowd forming , " T'Partha confirmed his fears . " You can hear it in the corridor . And it would be unwise to allow any provocation . " " From security or from the crowd ? " asked Solor . T'Vysse and Sarissa fixed him with identical glares . " My brother 's manners may be atrocious , " Sarissa announced , " but his question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the shuttle . All of us . " T'Vysse raised her eyebrows at Karatek as if picking up one of the antique swords that some people brought on board , either smuggled or as part of their weight allowance . Karatek knew better than to argue with her . More : she was right . Even the most battle-hardened te-Vikram would not offer violence to women who were visibly pregnant , like T'Vysse , or old enough to take a mate , like Sarissa , who remained unbonded after her betrothed since childhood had been slain in the desert defending her . T'Partha drew herself up , always her habit before she arrived at what she considered the sense of the meeting . No one sensed how opinions flowed into a consensus better than she or channeled the information to the scientific , technical , and security staff more diplomatically . She had greater skill with the arts of the mind than anyone else he knew who was not an indweller on Seleya or at Gol . He would rely on her at the coming council . But right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as security , to get to the shuttle that would take him there . Before leaving , his guards put on their helms . The heavy cheekpieces made them look curiously faceless , symbolizing the fact that the law was no respecter of persons . That some on Vulcan disagreed with this maxim had been one cause of the exile . The rule of law : many had already died back on the homeworld to defend it . Now , each year , more in exile died to preserve it . Streon and T'Via formed up ahead and behind Karatek and T'Partha . T'Vysse and their children joined what Karatek began to think of as a procession . Lovar , their middle son  --  the eldest now remaining to him  --  was standing watch . He had inherited Karatek 's gift for science and his mother 's dislike of the politics in which Karatek regretted involving her . ( " Am I an indweller , to be thus secluded ? " she had demanded of him . " We all dwell within these ships ; seclusion is not only illogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small party . As always , Karatek felt a moment 's surprise that a security guard had chosen to take an S-name in honor of Surak , now long dead . But he supposed that keeping order was , in itself , a logical activity . " Ready , " Streon announced through the com link built into his helm and opened the door . Noise erupted in the thin air as they walked down the corridor . The bleakness of its metal walls had been concealed , partly , by a mosaic of the land around Seleya , worked in cubes of glass that gleamed in the steady overhead lights . " Let us pass , let us pass , " Streon 's and T'Via 's voices were insistent monotones as they guided Karatek , T'Partha at his side , past people who pressed against the mosaics . Someone had chipped away some of the tesserae that had gone to form the image of the Gate of ShiKahr . Karatek saw Streon pause and quite obviously make a mental note for future investigation : casual disregard for public property was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing . Survival lay in detail . He knew better than to turn to see how T'Vysse fared . For one thing , she had already rebuked him with " I am only pregnant , not helpless " three times just in the last day . For another , he knew well that their children had taken her arms and were guiding her . Besides , he knew T'Via had medical training . As they edged through the gesturing , shouting crowd  --  no Surak followers there , to be sure  --  T'Partha kept up a far-from-casual flow of conversation . Duty rosters . The agenda of the conference they were to attend . It was meant to reassure , and it more or less succeeded . The guards whisked them into the welcome silence of the nearest ship 's lift . " No doubt the crowd will be worse at the shuttlebay , " Karatek observed . Behind him , T'Vysse sighed . Do you regret the decision to leave home , my wife ? Karatek forbore to ask . He remembered their small , walled villa in ShiKahr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every splash of the fountain in the pebbled courtyard , every line of the Forge beyond its walls came to mind , long gone , yet instantly familiar and loved beyond all logic . We have here all we need : the hope of Vulcan 's safety and of a better life at journey 's end . And our integrity , he told himself . You protest overmuch . Streon and T'Via tilted their heads , listening to the communications links inset in their helms . Their shoulders stiffened . " I agree . We face quite the sendoff , " T'Partha remarked . Streon awarded her a nod , tribute to the logic of her conclusion , if not her irony  --  although Surak too had been a master of the ironic reply . Karatek had taken more than one blow from it . " Brace yourself , " Solor told his sister . With a composure that had more to do with familiarity than with any control he had learned from Surak , he disregarded her hiss of rebuke . Even though Solor had legally been an adult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The results would have frustrated her profoundly if her control  --  and her courtesy  --  had not become so strong . " How is it out there ? " Karatek asked Streon . " Crowded , " he replied . In a Vulcan ship ! In a ship intended only to wage peace and find a new home ! Karatek felt his eyes heat . He had already disgraced himself once today ; he would not do so again . And when he returned from the council , he promised himself he would spend more time in meditation and less time recording events of what had already become a most painful Fifth of Tasmeen indeed . The lift door hissed open . The cries of the crowd pushed at him like heavy gravity . Government on board Shavokh was more personal and therefore noisier than on Vulcan . Karatek and T'Partha had expected to be met by people protesting various policies , people pleading for a chance to rejoin families , for lab space , for permission to demonstrate a new technique to the council . They had even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Karatek 's quarters . What they did not expect was what they saw blocking their access to the shuttle , which had withdrawn its long boarding ramp : a party of male te-Vikram , all but snarling at the security that , thus far , held them in check . They wore the gemmed regalia that Karetek knew they brought out only for the most solemn occasions . At their hips , they wore the triangular ceremonial blades of te-Vikram warrior-priests . They each held a long bundle , wrapped in green , glittering fabric that they unwrapped to produce a lirpa , one end bladed , the other a blunt , deadly war-hammer . When they presented arms , three additional te-Vikram stepped forward . Two carried systras . As they jangled the metal frames , the hundreds of bells strung on the instruments produced a painfully shrill chime that carried the message : Pay attention . Here is danger . And there stood danger itself , unarmed , but potentially explosive . The systra bearers flanked a man whose too-taut posture and blazing eyes were explained by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in here ? " T'Partha asked T'Via . The guard murmured into the com built into her helm . " Subterfuge , " she replied . " They claimed to have reserved a cargo hold for a religious rite . Under the circumstances "  --  she gestured at the sashed man , clearly in the grips of the Blood Fires  --  " that would only have been logical . A bonding ceremony would gain them access as well as the right to bring religious articles into the area . Once inside , they rushed the shuttlebay . " " If there was to be a bonding , " Solor asked , " where is this man 's mate ? " It was a logical enough question . He edged his way out of the lift , moving toward his father . " Observe the cloak on the deck , " said Solor . " The color of pure water , running over silvery stone . A poor enough attempt at seclusion of the bondmate before the ceremony . Deceit is not quite honorable in the strictest tradition , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get back ! " Streon 's voice , raised to a most illogical pitch , echoed in the shuttlebay . After all , Pon farr was only an aspect of Vulcan biology , not a plague . As disciples of Surak , whose disciplines prescribed regular meditation , Solor and Streon were actually less likely to suffer from the deadliest aspects of the Fires . That relative immunity to the Fires had also created some resentment on both sides : Surak 's disciples considered the te-Vikram weak-willed , a judgment that the te-Vikram , understandably enough , resented , considering they deemed the people of the cities soft . And the question of mates had never been resolved to anyone 's satisfaction . T'Via 's presence might be provocation , although she was a bonded woman . But the sight of Sarissa , unbonded and not even pledged , represented oil , ready to be poured upon a fire . T'Partha directed a warning glance at Karatek . Seeing that no priestess or matriarch of the te-Vikram kin was present to conduct the rites  --  and no intended bride present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he raised his voice , " what the problem is ? Aside , of course , from the obvious , " he added , with a glance toward the man in the grips of the Fires . A cloaked te-Vikram pushed his way forward but was brought up short against Streon , who halted him . The cloaked man 's hood fell back as he attempted to push past three more guards , who came up fast . Restrained , he stood there and simply glared . He was a man in late middle life , and though it had been many years since he , like the others of his clan , had walked the desert , his hair was still sun-reddened , his skin weathered . " N'Keth ! " Solor said . " Do you countenance this intrusion on my father 's duties ? " The situation had just improved minutely , Karatek decided . N'Keth and Solor had a long history , since the time during Solor 's rite of passage into legal adulthood when N'Keth had tried to kidnap the boy and take him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their subsequent reunion on board the shuttle taking them all to the Shavokh , had made for a grudging , ironic respect over the years of the journey . And it had n't hurt that Solor had interceded just when Rovalat , Solor 's teacher for the kahs-wan ordeal , had been trying to pound N'Keth 's head into a paste against a bulkhead . " N'Veyan requires that shuttle , " the te-Vikram elder told Solor . " His intended mate awaits him . " Karatek glanced quickly back at T'Partha . " The rule restricting travel was created to protect resources , not to cause madness and loss of life , " he murmured . They could afford one shuttle trip if it would save N'Veyan 's life and perhaps that of his intended mate . Many women could withstand the Fires without a mate , but there were always some who died . T'Partha inclined her head . Her eyes were remote . " The law is the law . It is no respecter of persons . " " It is only a rule ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of the one ... " Drawing a deep breath , T'Partha cast aside her cloak . She had aged during the journey , Karatek saw . There was a chance she might be considered a matriarch , venerable enough to mediate the ceremony of bonding , even one that still lacked a bride . N'Veyan looked toward T'Partha like a pilgrim , lost in the desert , sighting water . He lurched forward as if he were going to attack , or fall . At the last moment , he steadied himself sufficiently to kneel at her feet . T'Partha reached out with joined fingers to touch his temple . Her hand scarcely shook at all . Karatek revised upward his opinion of her yet again . " My eyes are flame , " N'Veyan whispered . " My blood is flame . " T'Partha 's eyes filled with a cool pity . Perhaps this day of memory would not be marked by the loss of yet another life . " The law was not intended to cause loss of life . " T'Partha nodded as she spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this man 's intended mate ? " she asked him . Wrong question , Karatek realized as Solor stepped forward . N'Keth 's face went remote , and N'Veyan gathered himself as if to spring at T'Partha . " You 've just violated their customs , " he hissed at T'Partha . " Te-Vikram seclude their mates before the ceremony and never mention women 's names before strangers . Ask who her family is , instead . " Louder , he cried , " Wait ! If you tell me who her family is , I will bring her back to you . " " Unattended ? " asked N'Keth . " Or would you send attendant males to guard her ? " He turned his back on T'Partha . " I am the father of a family , " Karatek said . " What use have I for another man 's mate ? " N'Veyan looked wildly around . Night and day , Karatek thought . The madness of blood fever makes him think I 've challenged , and he is looking for a way of invoking Kal-if-fee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she intoned . " Where is the bride ? " demanded N'Keth . The systra shook wildly . " The law is that if a bonding is forestalled , another bride must be provided . " N'Keth looked over at Sarissa . " You are my former captor 's sister . You are unbonded , though not of the order of unbonded . Need N'Veyan call challenge on your father and brother to win you ? Or shall I add your bloodline to my family peacefully ? " T'Vysse stepped in front of her daughter . Solor leapt between his old adversary and his elder sister . " When I was a child , I defeated you , " he began . " Which is why I rejoice at the opportunity to form a family relationship with you through N'Veyan , " N'Keth replied . He glanced appreciatively at Sarissa . " She is fit to be the mother of heroes . " Sarissa looked down , in brief , obligatory modesty  --  and to hide the fact that her eyes were flame  --  the fire of pure rage , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Then , she turned on her heel and walked back into the lift , escorted by T'Vysse . " Come on , " said Solor . " What are you going to do ? Fight me again ? Or will you have N'Veyan do it ? He is younger than I , true , but he is weakened by the blood fever . Even in the Plak-tow , he is no match for me , or for Security here . " Karatek stepped forward , waving aside the attempts of Streon and three other members of his team to push him and T'Partha toward the lift . They were all one people : scientists , adepts , te-Vikram , even politicians . And if they were all one people , if they were all going to survive , he needed to attempt to resolve this problem . " What do you think you are doing to our sacred customs ? We have offered you a solution that will preserve life , and you spurn it . I submit that it is not logical to die and forget all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " N'Keth said . " So they are , but this is about furthering life , carrying it to a next generation . So this , logically , is not one of those ' some things . ' " He strode forward . " Let me go and bring N'Veyan 's betrothed back . Let us leave challenges behind as one more remnant of the Mother World that we left on her sands . Please . " " Let him challenge , Karatek , " came a voice that still carried remnants of its former strength . It was old Rovalat , who had lost so many of his kahs-wan class the year the te-Vikram raided . " T'Kehr Karatek suggests we work together , and I concur . You do not ? Well enough . Space yourself . Walk out those gates into the desert of stars as you would return to the Womb of Fire at your life 's end . We can use the additional food and water . And we will make sure your names are forgotten . " N'Keth stepped forward , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " I have refused N'Veyan 's challenge . My sister , who is not of the order of unbonded , has left this place . So , N'Veyan 's only hope lies in finding his true mate . Give these elders her family 's name , and they will bring her back . Refuse , and lose another member of your kin . Reject as you may the teachings of Surak , even you must logically conclude that you have lost enough kinsmen already . " N'Keth looked over at N'Veyan , who was trembling visibly . One of his attendants set down his systra with a final discordant chime of bells to kneel beside him and help him stay on his feet . " Come , " urged Karatek . " Let us help you !
