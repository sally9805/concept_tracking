Fed up with e-brokers and chat rooms ? More and more people are turning to financial planners . Luckily , new Web-enabled software is making them smarter and more efficient . <p> At the peak of the dot-com Web stock craze , in September of last year , Robert Berkery , a 41-year-old sales director , got swept away . He signed up with Schwab , logged on to AOL and with his keyboard and mouse , made bets on Lucent , Intel and the IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund . <p> This was great fun . Each day he sat at his computer clicking his way through screens and commentary . The fun turned to panic and finally to remorse . With his savings cut in half , Berkery has sworn off e-trading . Humbled , he realizes " taking co ntrol " of his own finances was n't such a hot idea . He started looking for professional advice . <p> It 's a familiar story . Hundreds of thousands of e-traders are shell-shocked . Gone is their glimmering vision of retiring at 45 or owning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euphoria has given way to despair . The Employee Benef it Research Institute reports that only 63% of Americans believe they will have enough funds for retirement , down from 72% in 2000 . <p> Now in a more sober mood , millions of Americans have come to understand that they need more serious advice than what they get from the chatterheads on CNBC or CNNfn . Suddenly , setting up an estate plan or a systematic college savings program is a t op priority for them . But where to go for advice ? <p> If you are satisfied with a fairly simplistic approach , you can log on to financial Web sites , like MSN MoneyCentral , Quicken or Motley Fool . There 's no hand-holding or allowance for extraordinary circumstances , but any of these can help you organi ze your finances . <p> If you want more , you have a choice of nearly 20,000 independent financial advisers in the U.S. Americans have entrusted a staggering $2 trillion in assets to this trade . Unfortunately , it does not require much training to hang out a financial-plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a good software package , you can count on getting fairly competent advice . It 's a good idea , though , to find out whether he or she has at least passed the Certified Financial Planner 's CFP exam ( see box ) . <p> Good planners are supposed to look at your total financial picture , estate and tax planning , life insurance , retirement and college-savings accounts . This is pretty complex stuff and varies radically from individual to individual . That 's why most g ood planners rely on software  --  just as the best accountants do . <p> The newest software , accessible to them via the Web , takes into account a wide array of variables , from interest-rate assumptions to the tax impact of changing your state residency . <p> It incorporates real-time information from your various accounts . With this information , it applies intricate modeling programs to figure an optimal allocation of assets according to your priorities and risk tolerance . The software can then run &qu; ot ; Monte Carlo " simulations and tell you the likelihood of meeting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the risk out of dealing with an adviser . <p> Harold Evensky , 59 , of Coral Gables , Fla. - based Evensky , Brown &; Katz , has been a financial planner for three decades . He recently refitted his conference room with a wide-screen NEC monitor . Using his wireless keyboard and mouse , Evensky leads his clients through dozens of what-if scenarios , colorfully illustrated with interactive charts . <p> " In the past , " says Evensky , " we 'd find out what money the client had , their income , retirement goals , and then put it in the dumper and come up with 20 pages of tables and pictures . God forbid we made a mistake , it would take us 15 minutes to go downstairs and rerun the whole thing and print it out . And there was no interactivity with the client . " <p> The programs currently used by planners are capable of drilling into the minute details of your financial profile . How much of your money is in a standard IRA versus a Roth IRA versus a 401(k) ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund holdings experiencing too much drift , from growth to value ? The software will alert your adviser in seconds . <p> Listen to Betsy Billard , 41 , an independent adviser affiliated with American Express Financial Advisors . " I had a client in her 50s come in who had worked for Time Warner for over 20 years . After the merger with AOL , this woman was offered a r etirement package . Should she take it ? Would she be able to retire comfortably on the package plus her other resources ? She had done a great job saving in her 401(k) . " <p> Billard says her computer spit out the answer in minutes . Yes , the woman was in good shape financially . " I could show her literally year by year what her expenses looked like , and where she would be when she left , projected out until she was 9 0 . I assured her she would be fine if she took the package . " <p> Billard and 11,000 other Amex reps use a financial planning platform provided by a Chicago-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms . <p> Envestnet is a Turnkey Asset Management Program ( TAMP ) . It is capable of handling everything an independent financial adviser needs : client profiling , asset allocation , portfolio accounting , trading , performance reporting and billing . <p> This system will even create a personalized Web site for the planner . It also handles client portfolio rebalancing , quarterly statements and year-end tax reporting . <p> A key aspect of Envestnet is that it identifies for the user appropriate private money managers for client funds . Unlike mutual funds , these money managers will specifically tailor the client 's portfolio to his tax and investment needs . For example , it might assign 30% of a client 's assets to Ariel Capital Management for small-cap value stocks , 30% to Lazard Asset Management for international stocks and 40% to Holt-Smith &; Yates for large-cap growth . Envestnet selects the managers based on the ir risk-adjusted returns and investment style adherence . <p> For a client evaluation , Envestnet charges the planner from 30 to 50 basis points of the assets being evaluated  --  with a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their charges , which typically cost clients about 1.25% of assets . ( A basis point is 1/100th of 1% ; thus 50 basis points works out to $5 for every $1,000 under management . ) <p> Envestnet is only one of 57 firms vying for position in the TAMP market , says Tiburon Strategic Advisors . The business of supplying these services to independent planners is so promising that Fidelity , Morningstar and Charles Schwab are moving rapi dly into the business . <p> EnvestnetPMC was founded in 1999 by Judson Bergman , a 44-year-old former managing director of Nuveen Mutual Funds . He realized that independent planners needed sophisticated planning tools and better access to private money managers . <p> Envestnet 's " open architecture , " Web-based platform is a collection of the best applications in various disciplines . In client management it uses CRM-leader Siebel Systems . In financial planning it has partnered with Financeware.com . For real-time aggregation of clients ' various external accounts and portfolio tracking , Envestnet has developed its own software called Python . <p> Thanks to its merger with Denver-based Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  each with a different style to meet a particular need . " Our platform is configurable and brandable for anyone from a one- person shop to a firm with thousands of advisers , " says Envestnet Chief Executive Bergman . <p> Planner Evensky uses Envestnet for picking money managers . But he picks a different Web-based program called MoneyGuidePro for financial planning . <p> " I use MoneyGuidePro " he says , " because I can manipulate things on the fly with the client . My clients or their attorney , for example , can change things from their computers and see what happens when they take on more risk . " Say s Evensky . " Or if the clients are out of town we can still meet with them via the Web . " <p> Some of this software is extremely sophisticated . A client might want to retire on living expenses of $100,000 a year , with a second goal of purchasing a vacation home for $500,000 . The planner would input these goals and run the program to find th at the client had a 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70% chance with the second . Then the planner would run through what-if scenarios to increase the probability of getting that vacation home from 70% up to 100% . That might require shi fting more assets into growth stocks from bonds , working an extra year , or spending less in retirement . <p> Virginia-based ASP Financeware has designed tools that figure the trade-offs for different risk levels . One user is Orange County , Calif. planner Thomas C. Scott . " Financeware , " Scott says , " shows how the zigs and zags in the market could affect your return . " <p> For example , what happens to your retirement plans if the stock market is down 30% the year you turn 65 ? A client wishing to hedge against that possibility might want to configure her assets differently . <p> Or , says Scott , " I have some clients with 70% in fixed income . I might plug in the numbers and show them that based on market history going back to 1929 , the chances of achieving their goal is only 60% with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and show that by increasing the proportion of equity to 50% , their chances of succeeding increase to 90% . " <p> Of course software by itself wo n't protect an investor against an incompetent or dishonest adviser . Nor will it protect you from your own folly . " The sophisticated Web tools are great , " says Joel Bruckenstien , a Miramar , Fla. adviser . &qu; ot ; But the most important thing we do is keep our clients from making silly mistakes with their money . It 's about behavior modification and that 's a human thing , not a technology thing . " <p> That 's what a lot of people forgot when they blew their hard-earned assets doing momentum trading with hot technology stocks . Tamp Stampede <p> As investors seek fee-based advice from independent advisors , these Turnkey Asset Management Programs are sucking in assets . Technology is an important part of their pitch .
