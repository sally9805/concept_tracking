The water gleamed silver and black like a stream of mercury winding through the night . The almost full moon and the traffic lights on Kelly Drive spilled some light our way , and Susan had clipped a red blinking flash onto the back of her spandex top . Even so , as we shoved off the boathouse dock , we were clearly alone on the inky river , only a thin layer of carbon fiber separating us from the chilly waters of the Schuylkill River . For June , the night was unnaturally muggy . The weather had been abnormal lately , the air swelling , sticky and humid , with temperatures in the high eighties too early and for too many days . After sunset , the air had begun to cool , but it hung heavily , as if exhausted from the day . Maybe I was projecting ; I was drained , having spent a long , stifling day at the Institute , finishing paperwork and saying good-bye to patients , some of whom would n't be there anymore when I returned from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art projects and unfinished therapy programs , and I wanted simply to collapse at home , sorting myself out , chilling under a ceiling fan . By contrast , Susan had taken the day off , staying in her air-conditioned Center City home , supervising contractors who were putting in skylights and redoing the deck.She 'd been desperate to get out of the house and singularly unmoved by my claims of fatigue . " The water 's completely calm , " she 'd promised . " The row will be easy and quiet . The river will be empty -- no coaching launches to speed by and wake us . In fact , there wo n't be any other boats out at all . " She sounded pleased , as if being the only boat on the river in the dark was a plus . Frankly , I was uncomfortable rowing at night . The water was too black , too silent . Rowing on it seemed risky . I 'd tried to put up an argument . " Susan , we 're still novices . " " Exactly . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll be easier water than during the day . Trust me . " I 'd sighed , still resisting . " What am I supposed to do with Molly ? " Molly was my six-year-old daughter . So far , she 'd usually been at school when we rowed . Or , on weekends , she and Susan 's daughters Rollerbladed or rode bikes along the river on Kelly Drive . But at night , what was Molly supposed to do ? Nick was working late again , and with Angela off on her honeymoon , I had nobody to baby-sit . But Susan had been undeterred . She 'd offered to bring two of her daughters , Emily and Julie . " They 'll all stay at the boathouse , " she 'd said . " They 'll watch TV in the lounge for an hour . " " What about Tony ? " Tony Boschetti was the boathouse manager , and we 'd heard that he was n't happy about members leaving their children alone there . " Screw Tony . They 'll stay in the lounge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Molly and Emily were best friends ; Julie was older , almost eleven . They 'd be fine . After all , we 'd only be gone for an hour . And so , despite my reservations , I 'd agreed to go . We 'd left the girls in the lounge with sodas and bags of popcorn , then gone down to the deserted dock , gotten into the Andelai and shoved off . Susan was energized . In just a few months , she 'd become an avid , if not particularly skilled , sculler , bringing to rowing the same relentless fervor that she applied to the rest of her life . Susan did nothing halfway ; if she wanted to swim , she threw herself wholeheartedly , headfirst , into the pool . Somehow , she successfully managed her marriage , her three daughters , her active criminal defense law practice , her volunteer work at a homeless shelter , her second term as PTA president , her position with the Neighborhood Town Watch , and her never-ending process of redecorating her home and preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sculling was merely the newest of Susan 's many passions , and I knew from past experience that it was best not to interfere ; for a time , she would be utterly consumed . It was all Nick 's fault . Nick was the man I 'd been seeing , and he 'd been rowing since high school . The first thing he did when he moved to Philadelphia the year before was to buy a new sculling shell and join a boathouse . And as soon as the winter ice had thawed , he 'd begun rowing . Nick rowed when he was stressed or fatigued , when he needed to think or relax , when he needed to work off frustration or uncertainty . He rowed at all hours , often before dawn , and in all weather . When Susan had complained that her thighs were getting flabby , Nick suggested that she take up rowing . Before I knew it , Susan had signed us both up for a Learn-to-Row class . I 'd never have taken the class on my own , but Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than going to lunch , less expensive than shopping . Besides , she 'd argued , fortyish-year-old women like us needed to take action to resist rolling midriffs and the tolls of time . In the end , though , I took the class not because of anything Susan said , but because I was curious . What was this sport that lured Nick out of bed before the sun was up ? For years , I 'd been intrigued by the long , sleek shells on the river , the elegant sway of the rowers , the synchrony of their oars . I 'd wondered what it would feel like to be one of them , gliding on the water with silent strength and grace . But I 'd been an innocent . I 'd had no idea how all-consuming this new hobby could become . Or how it would change our lives . By the time our six weeks of Learn-to-Row classes had ended , Susan had become addicted . She 'd urged me to join Humberton Barge , one of the oldest rowing clubs on Boathouse Row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete in the Schuylkill Navy Regatta , the first race of the summer . Susan may have been the instigator , but , in my way , I 'd become hooked , too . We 'd even hired a coach , the controversial but esteemed Preston Everett , to work with us twice a week . A former Olympic champion , Coach Everett had the reputation of being both the most cantankerous and the most capable coach on the river . It had been Coach Everett who 'd assigned us our boat , a double named Andelai . And it had been Coach Everett who 'd assigned us our positions . As " bow , " Susan was to steer the boat and give commands ; as " stroke , " I was , basically , to keep quiet and obey her . This arrangement suited Susan perfectly . She enjoyed talking without interruption on any subject that breezed through her mind . As we rowed , she often commented on the natural environment , the lush foliage along the banks , the egrets and loons , the turtles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rant about her husband , Tim , and any of her three children . She talked about the clients she was defending , the rabid ferocity of prosecutors , the shoulders of the contractors working on her house , the price of slipcovers for her sunroom sofa , a new chili recipe that was rich with chocolate , the outcome of her impending mammogram , how much weight she 'd gained or lost , the burgeoning sizes of her teenage daughter 's bras . She saw her role as bow as a license to speak uninterrupted for as long as she wanted about anything . Mostly , I tuned her out . But buried in her monologue were occasional directions about rowing the boat , so I had to tune in at least marginally . We shoved off the dock , gliding gently away from the glowing lights of Boathouse Row . The water was smooth and sleepy , a dark mirror for the lights , and the boat slid along smoothly , undisturbed , leaving a rippling triangular trail . Rowing at night , I thought , might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romantic , in a way . Maybe Nick would row with me some evening . I pictured it , the two of us alone on the river under the dreamy moon . " Half-slide in two , " Susan called . " And stop splashing . " Splashing ? I was n't splashing , or I had n't thought I was . But I did n't say anything . Coach Everett had been very clear about in-boat behavior . The bow , and only the bow , was to speak . The bow was in command . Everybody else was to keep silent , backs straight and eyes focused forward . They were not even to turn their heads . " Watch your oars , " Susan ordered . Watch them ? What was wrong with them ? And how could I watch them if I was n't supposed to turn my head ? " Why ? " I called as I rowed , aware that , by speaking , I was breaking a cardinal rule . " What 's wrong ? " " You 're still splashing . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout ; the river was quiet but Susan was behind me , and I was faced away from her . And , along this stretch of the river , sounds of traffic on Kelly Drive and the nearby expressway muffled our voices . " Sometimes , " she shouted back . " And watch your slide . " My slide ? The slide is the part of the stroke when the legs bend as the rower 's seat moves up from bow to stern . But what about the slide was I supposed to " watch " ? Was it too fast ? Too slow ? Too early or late ? Why could n't she be specific ? Was she being deliberately obtuse ? Never mind , I told myself . Let it go . " And relax your shoulders . " Oh , boy . We had n't rowed five hundred yards yet . Was Susan going to comment on my every move for six more miles ? " Watch the splashing , " she shouted , " and give me pressure on port . More port . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about what else I wanted to give her . After we passed under the Girard Avenue Bridge , though , Susan changed her approach . " We have to relax , " she said . We ? " Our shoulders are tense . " She 'd begun referring to us as a single being . I took a deep breath , trying to focus , to inhale the warmth and calm of the night . The clear sky . The glassy water . Anything but the cloying commands of the bow . " We need to sit up tall , " she said . I closed my eyes , centering myself . Coach Everett had told us to row with our eyes closed so we could sense the boat moving in the water . I closed mine to escape the squawking in the bow . No good . Susan kept it up . She began to narrate each stroke , start to finish , in an annoying singsong cadence . " Hands away fast . Swing with our bodies . Now , slow slide . Roll our oars early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Susan , " I called , still rowing , " can we just row ? " " What ? " " Please . Just steer the boat and call the drills . Can you not talk so much ? " " I 'm the bow . I 'm supposed to tell you what to do . " " But you 're talking nonstop . I ca n't focus on rowing . All I can think about is you , talking . " " Excuse me ? " She was appalled at my insubordination . Stunned . " I ca n't believe this . Let it run . " That means stop rowing . Our oars slapped the water as we floated to a stop . I twisted around to face her . " What 's your problem , Zoe ? " Susan demanded . " You do n't like me being bow ? I did n't ask to be -- Coach Everett made me bow . " " I have no problem with you being bow --  " " Obviously , you do . You ca n't stand not being in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your control thing , is n't it ? " Oh dear , she was making it personal . She knew me too well , knew what my issues were . " Susan , no . It 's not about me . I do n't need to be in control --  " " Really ? Not about control ? Then what ? Your trust thing ? You do n't trust me to be bow . Is that it ? You do n't think you can rely on me ? " I closed my eyes and took a deep breath . " Susan . This is not about trust or control . It 's not about me . I really do n't mind you being bow . I just mind you being the bow from hell . " Oops . That was harsh . I felt her recoil , wounded and defensive . " How am I the bow from hell ? " " You criticize my every move --  " " No way -- I do not --  " " Oh , please , Susan . " " I 'm just doing my job . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to move the boat ? Focus on your own rowing instead of mine . " " My rowing ? What 's wrong with my rowing ? " The conversation was n't going well , but I could n't stop myself . " We 're both beginners , Susan . Neither of us is perfect . " " I did n't say I was --  " " But you blame me for every little wobble . " " That 's absurd . I do not . " Alone in the middle of the river , we scrapped like an old married couple . Susan was my best friend , and I knew the fight was n't worth it , but I was tired and cranky . We kept it up , jabbing , bickering , getting nowhere and behaving badly . " How about we both just shut up and row , " I finally said . I sat in the ready position , waiting for a command . " Fine , " she answered . " You want to row ? We 'll row . " Susan glowered at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Is it okay with you if I ask you to please sit ready ? " Uh-oh . Her tone was both sarcastic and ominous . I did n't know how , but she was going to make me pay for complaining . Sure enough , she began calling drills , steadily increasing our power and stroke rate , trying to exhaust me and prove who was in charge . I did n't challenge her again , did n't make a peep . I was going to prove I could perform at least as well as she could . So , when she called , " Take it up , " I cursed silently but took it up , pushing harder with my legs and swinging my body . Oddly , the harder I pushed , the more I enjoyed myself . My strokes became smoother as we gained momentum . The boat gurgled , leaving a bubbly , moonlit trail . Our oars clicked into place with each stroke , and we began to soar upriver , swinging together , pushing , feeling the burn of our muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we sped under Columbia Bridge and reached the tip of the overgrown pile of rocks called Peters Island . Halfway up the island , I was about to die . Susan had proved her point . She 'd won . I had to stop . I tried to say that I needed to stop , but I did n't have enough wind to talk . Susan yelled , " Take it up . Full power for forty . " I 'd had no idea that Susan was that sadistic . But my pride or my temper kicked in , and I did n't give up . From some remote sector of my being , I pulled out more energy and rowed faster , pushed harder than I 'd imagined possible , using my body weight as leverage against my oars . The boat took off . It skimmed the water , speeding ahead . We passed the woods of Peters Island in a whoosh . " Keep it up , " Susan huffed . I kept the rate up , legs and thighs aching , blood surging , lungs bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , the glide . I had the impression that we 'd left the water , that we 'd begun to fly . Apparently , Susan was similarly absorbed ; she did n't call a warning . Maybe she had n't looked ahead . Or maybe , in the darkness , she simply had n't seen anything that low to the surface . But , when we made impact , our boat lurched so violently that I flew off my seat . I stopped rowing midstroke , but my oars crashed into Susan 's . The boat shuddered , and we dipped dangerously to port . " Shit , " Susan shrieked . " Hold still ; do n't move . " I squatted , trying to balance , not able to get back onto my seat . We were tipping at an impossible angle . Slowly , I turned my head to look over my shoulder . Susan 's starboard oar stood erect in the water , definitely out of reach . She 'd lost hold of it ; its blade was entangled with mine , and both were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't see what we 'd hit , could n't turn far enough around . " Zoe -- stop . Do n't move . " " I 'm not moving . " " Do n't turn around . Set the boat . " " I ca n't set the boat -- my oar 's stuck with yours . " " Oh , shit -- hold still . " Cursing , Susan flailed at her starboard oar , trying to grab it , inadvertently knocking my oar deeper into the water , rocking the boat , tipping us even farther . " Susan -- stop -- we 're flipping --  " Susan stopped . In fact , she held completely still . " Dear God , " she breathed . " A floater . " " What ? " " We hit a floater . " Slowly , careful not to shift my weight , I turned to look . At first , all I saw was bloated cloth , lumpy yards of it , adrift on the water . Then , near the surface beside our oars , I made out a dim opalescent oval bobbing with the movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale oval took on definition . It had features . Eyes , a nose . Lips . Hair that disappeared into the dark water and reemerged , washing against its skin . " Oh , damn . " I do n't know who kept repeating that , Susan or I. Or maybe both of us . For a timeless second we sat , not moving , tilted at an unmanageable angle , staring at the body , balanced precariously at a forty-five-degree angle , our oars tangled up with a dead woman 's dress , our minds racing to figure out how to right the boat . Soon , though , we grasped the grim reality : It was too late . Any movement we made would disturb our delicate balance and flip the boat . In fact , even if we made no movement at all , we could n't maintain our balance much longer . We 'd tilted too far . There was nothing we could do . We could reach for our oars or not ; either way , we were going over . For endless seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , gently , teasingly , it rolled over , spilling us into the chilly black water of the Schuylkill . Continues ...
