All columnists are allowed to have pet peeves , so here 's one of mine . I ca n't abide the assumption that just because a country sits on top of natural resources , it is potentially rich . It is now conventional wisdom that the Arab economies are " failures " because they have wasted their oil wealth . After the recent death of Jonas Savimbi , the Angolan guerrilla leader , we were told that his nation should be one of the richest in Africa  --  all those diamonds and precious metals under the jungle , you see . <P> Gim me a break . Resources are a curse as much as a blessing , for two reasons . Over time technological change reduces the relative price of commodities , and the presence of abundant resources skews incentives . Extracting wealth from the ground can look so easy that other sectors of the economy are starved of investment . Apart from Australia and Norway , it is hard to think of resource-rich nations that have used their natural endowments to build balanced economies . By contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japan , Switzerland  --  got that way without any significant stock of natural resources . <P> But they all had something else : human capital . Over the past 20 years , economists have come to believe that a central determinant of a nation 's economic growth is the skill base and entrepreneurial moxie of those who live there . Human capital is a function of education , which is why successful Asian tigers ( like Singapore ) and fast-growing developing countries ( like Mozambique ) put so much stress on the quality of their schools . German schools and universities used to be the envy of the world , especially in math and science . But the country has been shocked by a couple of recent reports from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . The average performance of German high school students in math and science is now below that seen in most OECD countries , with a worryingly large gap between the strongest and weakest German students . Moreover , only about 1 in 6 of those who graduate from a German secondary school ever completes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Americans . Germany 's free public universities are a joke , full of perpetual students who have little contact with professors . As my colleague Charles Wallace , TIME 's Berlin bureau chief , has reported , serious German students are flocking to private , fee-charging institutions , many of which use English as their medium of instruction . <P> How does the U.S. rank in the international human-capital standings ? That 's a tricky question . Over time the American economy has shown more dynamism and sustained growth than just about any other . But if you look only at the performance of the average American high school student on international tests , you would think we were a nation of dim-witted dullards . What explains the paradox ? <P> To some extent , the answer must be the quality of American universities , which are highly efficient , intensely competitive and wonderfully endowed and which increasingly recruit the best students in the world . But university professors are n't magicians ; however skilled they may be , if their inputs from high schools are garbage , their outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
