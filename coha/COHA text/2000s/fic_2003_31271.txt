Killing people is so easy that the iron laws of supply and demand make it hard to earn a decent living doing it . As a result , murder for hire is almost always a sideline , and the people who engage in it are by and large stupid losers , quickly caught , and quicker still to rat out the idiots who hired them . The very few real professionals in the business are careful never to meet their clients . Instead , they deal through people like Mr. Ballantine . Mr. Ballantine is sitting in the driver 's seat of his Mercedes sedan at the corner of Gansevoort and Washington Streets at 7 P.M. on a Sunday evening , about the loneliest place you can be on the island of Manhattan . This is the old meatpacking district , deserted at this hour , except for the occasional street person . It 's early summer , the sky is the dull color of galvanized metal and seems to reflect the heat of the day down upon the City . Although the river is close by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash on the street do not stir . Mr. Ballantine has the air-conditioning on high . He is listening to a Frank Sinatra CD . Frank is singing " Fly Me to the Moon . " A white car goes by , brakes at the end of the street , and does a clumsy U-turn . Its driver parks behind the Mercedes and gets out and , as he has been instructed to do , enters the rear seat . Mr. Ballantine does not turn around . His dark eyes meet the watery blue ones of the other in the rearview mirror . " Ballantine ? " " That 's right . Did you bring the money ? " " I can get it . I wanted to discuss the details . " Ballantine allows himself a small sigh and glances at the dashboard clock . He had hoped that this would go smoothly , as he has an appointment downtown , but obviously he was wrong . He studies what he can see of the man in the mirror . A pale disk of face , late forties , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat longer than the current fashion in New York , a dark suit jacket with a gold pin of some fraternal order in the lapel , a thick tie with a heavy , mixed pattern . An out-of-towner , a hick . A little cornpone in the voice , too . A Southerner ? That would be unusual . Southerners usually did it themselves . " No , we do n't discuss the details , " Mr. Ballantine says . " You give me twenty-five now and it gets done and you give me twenty-five again . That 's it , end of discussion . " " I do n't know . That 's a lot of money , you know . Just to hand over to someone you never seen before . " Not Southern ; a hillbilly of some kind . Mr. Ballantine is tempted to cut it off right there , tell the hick to get lost , but he has already invested some time and money . He has paid the bartender who picked up the job , and the guy the bartender told , who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that off as overhead , but still ... " Look , " says Mr. Ballantine , " you never did this before , am I right ? " " Yeah , but ... " " I 've done it a lot , which tells you something . That I know what I 'm doing . Because , you know , this is illegal . " A short bark of a laugh from the rear seat . " Right , and I 'm still here , on the outside . Also , think about it for a minute : I 'm dealing all the time with people who want to get rid of other people , they 're not going to sit down for getting ripped off . I would n't be in business if I did that . This is the way it has to be . No questions . I do n't know you , you do n't know me . You do n't know who I 'm going to get to do the job . He does n't know you . Me , I 'm just a voice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post office box as far as he 's concerned . Everyone is sealed off from everyone else , you understand ? Seal-off is the main thing . That and the professional job , experienced personnel , guaranteed operation , and so forth . Now , I 'm not saying there 's not cheaper ways to go . " " For example ? " said the man in the backseat , his tone avid . Mr. Ballantine checked his mirror . The man 's eyes were wide with interest . " For example , you could find some guys in a bar around where you come from , a couple of tough guys , what d'y'call them , good old boys . And you could give them a couple of grand and they 'd go do it for you . Assuming they do it at all and not get drunk and fuck it up , it 'd take maybe three , four days before they told someone , or the cops traced something they dropped at the scene back to them , and a couple of hours after that , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up quicker than shit . On the other hand , you saved all that money . " " I 'm not that stupid , Mr. Ballantine , " said the man coldly , after a brief silence . " We do n't know that yet . If you 're not stupid , either you 're going to forget about the job , kiss and make up with this fella , or you 're going to give me twenty-five large in assorted unconsecutive currency . Those are the two nonstupid options . Up to you , Jim . I could care less either way . " " I 'll have to think about it , " said the man , easing across the seat . " Other people are involved in this . " That would be another mistake , thought Mr. Ballantine , but said nothing as the man walked back to his rental . When the car had disappeared , Mr. Ballantine got out into the heat and snapped off the magnetized fake New York plates and tossed them in the trunk , revealing the authentic Jersey plates underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of a sun-dazed nap and she sat up in the beach chair , checking first of all to see if Lizzie was there , and of course she was , building her sand castle where the sand got damp . There were two boys , about ten years old , both dark-haired and lean , one in a red Speedo suit and one in baggy cutoffs . They were splashing in the shallows of the Sound , playing with something big and black , a truck-tire inner tube ? In the distance was an adult , obscure now in the glare and salt haze . A woman . Rose allowed herself a moment of annoyance . Crab Point was a private beach , although who it actually belonged to just now was a lawyer 's guess . But it had been in her family for generations . She had come here as a child , to the big white house on the beach , and she had brought the boys here when they were babies , and now , after a long hiatus , she had brought Lizzie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a public park , with her two noisy kids and her Dog . The thing was the size of a calf , black , dripping sea spray and slaver , and it was rushing directly at her and Lizzie . Her belly jumped with fear . She started to get to her feet to get between the monster and her little girl , who was kneeling next to her sand castle , her back to the onrushing dog , oblivious . There came a piercing double whistle and the dog , now not more than three yards from Rose , spun instantly around like a mechanical toy , throwing a gout of sand as it skidded , and immediately began to race back toward the other woman . Who waved and called , " Sorreeee ! " Rose experienced a rush of anger , at the woman and that animal , but also at herself , for her appalling cowardice . She had never been frightened of dogs before . " Can I go in , Mom ? " asked Lizzie . " It 's boiling . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , honey , I 'll come with you . " Rose was afraid of the water , too , afraid of letting the girl go in by herself , although Lizzie had been a good swimmer since the age of five . When had she become a coward ? As soon as she asked the question , she knew . From the water , floating on her back , she watched the other woman spread her blanket and set up her backrest , and , with somewhat more interest , her undressing . She wore a small , blue-striped bikini , although she was rather mature for a bikini  --  late thirties , early forties , Rose judged . A terrific , lithe body though , obviously one of those disgusting women who could eat anything and went wiry rather than slack with age . Another reason to dislike her . Rose rolled over and began to swim back and forth on the gentle swell . Maybe she could work off a few pounds before Red got here . The next day , the woman was there again , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not repeat its threatening dash . It played with the boys or sat like a basalt sphinx by the woman 's side . She waved , and Rose returned a barely polite one . The next three days were the same . They arrived around four and stayed for a couple of hours . The woman rubbed herself with baby oil , but did not apply sunblock , nor was she apparently worried about her children burning up , unlike Rose herself , who was constantly laving her own skin and that of her daughter with Plus 20 . The boys were identical twins . Through her covert observations , Rose learned that the one with the red Speedo was called Zik , and the one in the baggies was Zak . They were oddly different : Zik spent his time making elaborate sand sculptures ; Zak spent his chasing shorebirds , and throwing sticks for the dog , and building crude sand castles , which he demolished with thrown clods as soon as built . Eventually he would squash part of his brother 's work and there would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept to herself , but she could not help her curiosity . On a trip into Holden , she 'd asked Donna Offut at the grocery , who knew everything , and learned that the family was from the City and had bought the old Wingfield farm . The woman raised big dogs and trained them for guard work . There was a husband , too , who worked in New York and came out on the weekends . The woman was named Ciampi . Apparently she 'd made a pile in the market and spent a chunk of it buying and fixing up the derelict place . In all , thought Rose , not the sort of person she particularly wanted to know . The South Shore was , of course , loaded with that type , but up until now the less attractive , less accessible far North Shore had been relatively unscathed by nouveaux hordes . But maybe that was going , too ; another little gritty bit of sadness . On the fifth day , the Ciampi woman arrived without the dog and with only Zik in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the usual baby oil routine . Rose was again astounded . Had the woman never heard of cancer ? And letting that boy run around in this blazing sun was close to child abuse . Had she appeared stark naked , Rose could not have been more shocked . On the contrary , she might even have approved , as long as a reasonable sunscreen had been applied . Rose adjusted her position under the shadow of her beach umbrella to leave no skin subject to the toxic rays . Taking up her Harper 's , she read four pages about the horrendous state of agricultural inspection before dozing off . When she opened her eyes , she found Lizzie and the boy were building a sand castle of prodigious size , not the usual lumpy kid construction , but something far more sophisticated , with sheer , smooth walls pierced by arched gates , buttresses , and high , round towers . The boy was dabbing wet sand onto the structure and talking , weaving a story about the tiny lead figures they were arranging on the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisoned queens , dark riders , heroic elves . Lizzie was chattering along with this , as if she had known the boy for years . Rose listened , fascinated and amazed . It had never happened in her experience that a ten-year-old boy had volunteered to play with a girl of the same age . Then Lizzie became aware of her mother 's stare and grew self-conscious enough to break the enchantment . She stood and walked over to Rose 's blanket , the boy following . " We want a drink , " said Lizzie , reaching into the insulated bag . " Drink , please . And offer one to your friend , Elizabeth , " said Rose , smiling at the boy , and getting her first close look at him . He was at the very peak of his boyish beauty , and the peak in his case was remarkably high . Dark curls , bisque skin , large black eyes with thick , unforgivable lashes , a cupid-bow mouth , and the germ of what would become a straight Roman nose . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Lizzie . " Coke , please , " said the boy , and Rose said , " I thought your name was Zik ? " " Oh , that 's my baby name . My brother is Isaac or Zak and so I had to be Zik . Parental humor , ho ho . My brother is the only one who still calls me Zik . " He lowered his voice and looked grave . " He 's profoundly retarded . " Rose 's brow twisted in sympathy . " Oh , how awful . I 'm sorry . " " Yes , well , we try to cope and all . That 's why he 's not here today . He had to go to Creedmore for his ... you know , his treatments . " Lizzie said , " Their dog killed all their rabbits , Mom . " " Yes , " said the boy . " It was a huge mess . He ravaged them . There were bunny parts all over . That 's why he 's not here either . My mother flogged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She might shoot him , or sell him to , you know , a dogfight man . " He took a long sip from his Coke as they stared . " Boy , I was really thirsty . My Mom never brings anything but beer , but , you know , a couple of beers on a hot day and I get a headache and Zak is uncontrollable and has to be whipped . " " Whipped ? " said Rose with a gulp . " Oh , sure . My mom 's quite the flogger . Look ! " He half-twisted to show his upper back . Two thin parallel scars ran from his shoulder almost to his spine , pale against the tan . " I overturned a pitcher of martinis and she got out the dog whip on me . She 's totally out of control when she gets plastered . I think she feeds us beer to destroy our brain cells . She 's really quite sadistic . She used to give my sister sherry in her baby bottle . " " Did it work ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister speaks forty-eight languages perfectly , but otherwise she 's a complete idiot . She sometimes puts her shoes on the wrong foot . " Rose sighed and said tartly , " You know , it 's one thing to make up stories and another thing to tell fibs . I 'm sure your family would be very unhappy if they heard you talking about them that way . " Giancarlo 's response was a smile of such devastating charm that light seemed to leap from his face , and Rose 's irritation melted away and she laughed , reflecting in the moment that laughs had been few and far between recently . Lizzie broke into giggles , too . In a moment they were all three roaring like a sitcom laugh track . " What 's the joke ? " Rose looked up and saw that Giancarlo 's mother was standing at the edge of their beach blanket , holding a long-neck Schlitz . " I was being amusing , Mom , " said Giancarlo . " I bet , " said Marlene . She nodded to Rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less responsible for this creature . " Rose introduced herself and her daughter , who asked , " Did your dog really eat up all the rabbits ? " Marlene gave her son a sharp look . " A rabbit got out and Gog chased it . Gog is not built for chasing rabbits . The rabbit is safe . What other lies did he concoct ? " " He said you flogged him with a dog whip and gave him a scar , " said Lizzie . " That 's more of a prediction , " said Marlene . " In point of fact , he got those scratches falling on a bale of razor wire he was told more than once not to go near . " " And I assume his brother is n't retarded either , " said Rose . " What ! " " He is , " insisted the boy . " She 's in total denial about it . " Marlene went after him with an openhanded roundhouse aimed at the red Speedo , which he easily dodged . He danced away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves it , Mom . " The children went back to their sand castle , chortling . " Pull up a beach , " said Rose , and Marlene sat . Rose noticed with a distinct shock that the woman was missing several joints of the small fingers of her left hand . Otherwise , she was remarkably beautiful , in a Mediterranean way . " He must be quite a handful , " Rose said , " with that imagination . Is his brother the same ? " " Completely different in every respect . You can barely get a word out of him . Gianni , as you see , is an artist . " Giancarlo was carving a delicate arch in a thin curtain of sand . " I do n't see how he gets it to stick together , " said Rose . " It 's marvelous . " " Oh , yes . Sometimes a little too marvelous for daily use . Zak never picks up a crayon . His thing is war , guns , blowing things up , taking things apart , heavy machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're having a backhoe in to rip out and replace a water pipe to the kennels . Watching a backhoe is his idea of paradise . " " He should meet my husband . They 'd have a lot to talk about . " " Your husband runs a backhoe ? " " A dragline . Or did . He 's with the union now . " " Really ? I 'm not sure I know what a dragline is . " " It 's an excavation machine . The bucket can take a hundred and fifty yards at a bite , three hundred tons or so . The powerhouse is the size of a small office building . They use them in open-pit mining . " " Presumably not on Long Island , though . " Rose laughed . " Oh , no . Robbens County , West Virginia . That 's where we 're from . Or that 's where Ralph is from . I 'm from next door . The big white house . " " There 's a story there . " " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear it . Let me get the beer . " So Marlene dragged her cooler over and they sat under the umbrella and slowly drank and rubbed the icy bottles against neck and forehead , watching the slow , remarkable extension of Giancarlo 's sand palace , and talking . Rose talked , rather , and Marlene listened . She seemed good at it , professional even , and Rose was not surprised to learn that she had been a prosecuting attorney in New York and later a private detective . Marlene , for her part , after offering the minimum personal data , was content to let the other woman ramble on . Rose Heeney was the sort of woman she had never been much interested in , a type she privately called the Cheerleader . She had been exposed to a number at Smith . They had golden hair and blue eyes and were fair and round of limb . They wore kilts and circle pins and had bright , straight teeth . They strolled in laughing gaggles , dated fraternity boys , and married early  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alumnae news . And Rose Wickham Heeney was what they became , it seemed . Or not quite . Heeney had not been in the master plan of the Wickhams . They had not envisioned an Irish roughneck dragline operator for their golden girl . They focused , naturally enough , on the kids . Besides Lizzie , there were two sons , Emmett , twenty , and Daniel , eighteen . The former had gone to Wheeling for a couple of years , then dropped out to work in the pit . Dan was at MIT . Marlene detected regret in her tone , and a pride in the younger that could never be fully expressed lest it hurt the older boy . " Do you really have a daughter , " Rose asked , " or did he make that up , too ? " " No , Lucy 's real enough . She 's in Boston , too , as a matter of fact , at BC , a freshman . " " Oh , good , " Rose said , smiling . " And I assume she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on right . " " I do n't know about the shoes , but she does speak something like that many . " " You 're kidding me ! " " No , actually not . She 's some kind of language prodigy . Scientists come in from all over the world to study her , and good luck to them . I have not been blessed with normal children . Although , Zak seems normal enough , except for being Gianni 's twin . I think he makes a practice of it . So how did you and ... ? " " Ralph , but everyone calls him Red . " Marlene glanced at the blaze of copper on Lizzie 's head . " I should have guessed . How did you and Red hook up ? " " Oh , you know , my social conscience . After I got out of Vassar I messed around in New York for a year , working for a magazine , which folded , and I guess I was supposed to get a job at another magazine and wait around to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? That or be a modern woman and go to professional school like you . But I did n't want to go to professional school , and I was n't exactly sure I wanted to be a modern woman . The guys I was dating ... I mean , they were all right , but you know ... " " Bland . " " Bland , or totally focused on the greasy pole , or ... I dated a sculptor with a loft in SoHo for a while , but honestly , all those people ... I could n't take them seriously , the black clothes and that attitude and the constant backbiting about everyone 's work . And so I applied to VISTA . " " After the sculptor broke your heart . " Rose laughed longer than necessary and drank some beer . " Yeah , you got me pegged . The Foreign Legion of the white girls . They sent me to Haw Hollow , West Virginia , to help run a craft cooperative . It mainly involved bookkeeping and writing grant applications and arranging child care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can imagine it was quite a shock . You do n't think people live like that in America anymore . I mean white people . " " Poor . " " Is not the word . The whole county is kept alive by miners ' pensions . They wo n't take any help from the government , you know . Extremely proud , living in these little hamlets up in the hills  --  hollers is what they call them . The water 's all rotten from the acid drainage . Half the county looks like moonscape from the strip and pit mines . They 're supposed to rehab the land , but a lot of them do n't  --  the coal companies . And they wo n't just leave and go to the cities for work . They want to stay by their home places . " Rose sighed . " And so there I was , a little middle-class girl doing her social obligation , and one night I drove down to McCullensburg  --  that 's the local metropolis , population twelve thousand , a Mickey D , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the various do-good types , and after all the social workers had droned on for a while , this guy steps up to the mike , and he gives this incredible , incredible speech , all about the hard lives of the people , and how bad they 'd been treated by the mine companies and the government , and how they deserved dignity . He said the mountain people were the best people in America , how they were the only ones still living the original vision of America . I mean , it was a stem-winder , and you could see he really believed it . " " It sounds like a Pete Seeger concert . " " Oh , right , I was the same way  --  nobody 's more cynical than an idealist trying to deal with twenty kids and a busted toilet . I guess you had to be there . We gave him a standing ovation . We were in the Methodist church hall and they had coffee afterward and I went up to him and told him how much I liked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap , and I said , no , he inspired me , and he gave me this look , I ca n't explain it , but no one had ever looked at me that way before . Penetrating , like he could peer into the bottom of my gas tank and see it was more or less empty . And he pointed to all the various social-work and church-lady and government types in the room and said , you think I inspired these people ? Yeah , to applaud for a minute or two . And then they 're going to go back to doing what they 've always been doing , taking a middle-class paycheck for helping the poor and downtrodden . They 're not going to change . They 're not going to put their bodies on the line for something . " Rose paused and took a gulping swallow of beer . Marlene saw that she was flushed , but whether from the beer or the sun or the rush of memory , it was impossible to tell . " He was n't just posing either , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefties , who you just knew were going to cut off their hair in a few years and go to work for some company , or keep it long and get tenure . He was the real deal . And it was Robbens County , too . " She looked at Marlene and saw the incomprehension she expected . " No , you never heard of it . Neither had I before I got there . They used to call it Red Robbens . The unions against the owners , like it was all through the coal country back around the turn of the century , but in Robbens it was different , and worse . The labor stuff was just overlaid on top of a kind of low-level tribal war that 'd been going on there for a hundred years . Some families sided with the owners , some were union , so the violence was particularly bad . For a while there were whole hollers up there with no males over twelve in them . All the men were dead or in prison . They sent in the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killing . The soldiers were afraid to go up into the hills , and there were n't any decent roads to get them up there , either . The area did n't really settle down until the war and the government made sure that the coal kept flowing and made the companies settle with the union . Then they started pit mining and the whole thing collapsed . " Rose stopped and laughed nervously . " Oh , God , I 'm being a bore , are n't I ? You do n't want to hear about the industrial history of Robbens County , West Virginia . " Marlene laughed , too . " Since you asked ... but I take it there was an attraction . I mean that night . " " Oh , God , yes . I wanted to throw my body into the cause . " " So to speak . " Rose chuckled . " Right , that , too . It 's such a clich , I know  --  well-brought-up girl from Long Island meets working stiff . But the work  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about really helping suffering people find their dignity . Anyway , that 's the story . After my VISTA hitch was over I moved into his place . A trailer . My parents went nuts , of course , but they had to stand for it , given the times , and the fact that in three months I was pregnant with Emmett . At least he 's white , as my father charmingly said , more than once . " Rose fell silent and looked out past the kids , to the Sound . " So , is it almost heaven ? " Marlene asked lightly . " West Virginia ? Formerly . The parts that are n't scarred , they 're really lovely  --  blue hills rising out of the mist , the woods full of flowers in the spring . But the damage is awful  --  whole mountains reduced to slag . Majestic is less than responsible in reclamation , and they have , let 's say , a good deal of influence with the legislature . " In response to Marlene 's inquiring look Rose added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only employer , so as you can imagine , there 's not much environmental consciousness , except for the Robbens Environmental Coalition . Which is me , and a bunch of high school students and the Presbyterian minister . And "  --  here Rose waved her hands and rolled her eyes  --  " and , McCullensburg is a little sparse culturally . On the other hand , there 's not much money . Union officials are not the best paid , if they 're honest , and Red 's as honest as they come . I got a little inheritance when I turned thirty , and we bought a crumbling farmhouse and fixed it up . Talk about stories ... if you ever want to be truly bored , I 'll tell you about the bats , and the hornets in the well house . " " It sounds like a good , if unexpected , life . " " Oh , sure , it was ... is , I mean . " She 's going to tell me now , Marlene thought , with a certain sinking of the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's on drugs , something . Marlene 's husband said that Marlene could take a stroll down Grand Street and before she 'd gone two blocks , forty-three women in trouble would have leaped from doors and windows into her path . She knew the signs , anyway , a pinched look , the eyes drifting , the speech a little too positive . This one was on a tight rein , kept it in mostly , would probably come to regret this impromptu , overly casual intimacy with a stranger . But at that moment , the kids came running up with demands to be fed , and consulting Marlene 's watch , the women realized what irresponsible sluts they had been , for it was past six , and Lizzie , although slathered with enough sunscreen to render harmless a smallish nuclear device , had developed a burn around the edges of her suit . So they packed up , pulled on shorts and tops , and walked through the dunes to the sandy blacktop road . A red , late-model Dodge pickup was parked on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road , " Rose said , pointing . " Get in , " said Marlene . " We 'll drop you off . " Rose objected that it was n't necessary , but Giancarlo had already let the tailgate fall and was helping Lizzie up into the truck bed . " Let 's go for pizza , Mom , " he said . " Another time , " said Marlene . " That means yes , " he said to Lizzie , and started to chant , " Pizza pizza pizza , " jumping up and down and making the truck rock on its springs . " I ca n't imagine what 's got into him , " said Marlene to Rose with feigned innocence . " He 's usually so well-behaved . " To her son she said , " What about Zak ? He 's probably starving , too . And we 're all too covered in sand to sit in a restaurant . I want to take a shower and I 'm sure Mrs. Heeney does , too . " Marlene was demonstrating motherly reasonableness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Giancarlo pulled a stunt like this , she would have leaped into the truck bed and tossed him out on his butt , which Giancarlo , being his mother 's son , knew very well , and which was the reason he felt free to be as brazen as a pot now . " We can pick him up , " the boy protested . " And we can go to the Harbor Bar and sit at the outside tables . Puleeeze , Mom ? " " Oh , the dear old Harbor Bar ! " said Rose . " Oh , let 's ! As long as you promise to pour me home and not get dangerous drunk yourself and protect my daughter 's virtue and mine and leave 15 percent and floss after meals . Puleeeze ? " So they got into the truck and Marlene drove down the peculiarly named Second Avenue , which is what the beach road is called in that part of the North Fork , and turned at the sign that read Wingfield Farm in incised letters touched with flaking gold . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Holstein had been replaced by a laminated photo of a black mastiff , and where it had said Registered Holsteins , it now said : AKC Registered Neapolitan Mastiffs Guard Dogs Trained in the Kohler Method They drove past it down a rutted , grass-grown path , through a thick stand of low pines , and into a large yard , shaded by a huge , dark persimmon tree and a row of ragged lilacs . At the head of the yard was a large clapboard house with a brick-colored tin roof and a screened porch . Its white paint was peeling and gray with age . A rambling rose with new flowers grew untidily up one side of the house and onto the roof . Just visible behind the house was the top of a barn , from which came the sound of mad barking . Rose cried , " Oh , it looks just the same ! We used to come here for fresh butter and eggs . I have n't been here in years . " Marlene got out and went to the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the manner of his kind by shoving his wet nose into her crotch and drooling on her foot . She let him slip by her and shouted into the house for her son . Silence . She went through the house into the kitchen , once again reminding herself that she absolutely had to get rid of that flowered linoleum and the pink paint job , and went out the back to the barn . The dogs in their kennels set up a racket , and she calmed them and greeted them by name  --  Malo , Jeb , Gringo , all young dogs in training , and Magog , the brood bitch . Magog was lying on her side , looking dazed as five newborns tugged at her teats . " How are you baby ? " Marlene asked tenderly , and allowed the animal to lick her hand . " I know just how you feel . " Behind the barn , she saw that the yellow backhoe was still there , although deserted , together with the flatbed truck it had come on . She inspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn and saw , with dismay , that the project had been stopped by an enormous boulder squatting in its depths like a petrified rhino . She shouted out for Zak and made a perfunctory check of the other buildings  --  a long , swaybacked , decayed chicken coop and a dusty greenhouse  --  and was not surprised to find them empty of all but the lower forms of life . Back at the truck , she saw that Gog was on his hind legs at the passenger-side window , trying to get at Rose , who had rolled up the window ; her face was nearly obscured by the dog slime on the glass . Marlene called him off and dropped the truck 's tailgate . The dog leaped in , amid shrieks from Lizzie and giggles from the boy . " That dog ! " said Rose . She looked a little pale . " He 's perfectly harmless , " said Marlene .

He 's undoubtedly with Billy Ireland , my trainer , probably at a hardware store looking at flanges or valves and having the time of his life . " Holden was little more than a half mile from the farm , a wide place on Second comprising a gas station , a grocery and general store , a miniature marina with a boat-livery/bait-'n ' - tackle appendage , three motels , one with a coffee shop attached , four houses ( summering as bed-and-breakfasts ) , and the Harbor Bar . Stuck on the narrowest point of the North Fork , Holden offered access to both the Sound and Southold Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tiny beach town that had long vanished on the South Shore or farther west ; people in Holden still pronounced Montauk with the accent on the second syllable . The Harbor Bar was a low , green-roofed white building with beer signs in the windows , backed right up to the water , with a weathered deck built out on pilings trimming it on one side and at the rear . White tin tables with beer-company umbrellas flying from them were set out on the latter , each accompanied by an odd assortment of chairs . " ' For men must work , and women must weep , ' " Rose intoned as they followed the trotting children down the deck , " ' and there 's little to earn and many to keep , though the harbor bar be moaning . ' My dad used to say that whenever we came here . He claimed it referred to the drunks at the bar . God ! Maybe they 're all still there , still moaning . " The children ran to a table and the women followed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-reddened tourists on their way back from Shelter Island or Orient Point . One table , however ( its top nearly covered with empty beer bottles ) , was filled with locals  --  two dark , tanned thirtyish men , one burly and tattooed and balding , the other ponytailed , both in cutoff jeans , muddy work boots , and wife-beater shirts , plus an older man , slim , well-knit , blue-eyed , florid , with a fine dust of graying gold on his head , and next to him , a very dirty little boy with a white hard-hat flopping on his head . The blond man caught sight of their group and nodded , smiling , at Marlene , a deep nod , nearly a bow , but nothing mocking about it . The boy saw her , too , and Marlene was not surprised to see appear on his face an expression far from that which ought to blossom on the face of a lad observing his beloved mom , but something much more like dismay . Marlene ignored him and sat down . The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper games thoughtfully provided on the place mats . " The prodigal son is getting his bag on after a hard day 's work , " Marlene remarked , and , following Rose 's look over at the other tables , added , " The Damico brothers , Gary and Phil , general contractors , and Billy Ireland . I think I 'll just leave the four of them alone . They look too crude for the likes of us . " " They would be the Shelley Society in McCullensburg , " said Rose . Marlene picked up a little card stuck to the chrome stand that held packets of sweetener . " Gosh , anchovies and artichokes is the special pizza and they 're doing crabcakes , by which I can tell it 's Friday . " She waved to flag down a waitress . " I 'm sorry to say we ca n't get shit-faced . I have to pick up my husband at eight oh seven . " " I bet he 's not crude , " said Rose . " Oh , he has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to me . " " Your trainer is staring at you . Not necessarily an employee-employer look , if I may say so . " " Yes , well , that 's partly why I keep him around , " said Marlene . " And he 's terrific with the dogs . "
