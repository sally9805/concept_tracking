<p> Officials from the country 's leading basketball governing bodies have discussed in detail the creation of a national academy for elite high school players that could drastically alter the landscape of amateur basketball . <p> The talks represent the first time most of the nation 's most powerful basketball entities  --  the NBA , the NCAA , USA Basketball and shoe companies  --  have together talked about a concept to reform the sport at a grass-roots level . <p> The intent of the academy would be to create a structured system in which talented high school players would get a sound academic and basketball education . During the NBA Finals in June , Commissioner David Stern said dialogue had begun regarding whether the NBA should support such an academy . And last month , NCAA President Myles Brand said that perhaps it was time for all of the nation 's basketball entities to work together to help improve the " pre-college environment . " <p> However , the most specific details of such a plan have been proposed in recent dialogues initiated by Sonny Vaccaro , Reebok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an academy to NCAA representatives in a conference call earlier this week and discussed details of the proposal at length in a telephone interview . Vaccaro said he has discussed his proposal with Stern ; Jerry Colangelo , managing director of USA Basketball ; NBA deputy commissioner Adam Silver ; and Kevin Lennon , NCAA vice president for membership services . <p> " We can broker a peace here , " said Vaccaro , who over the past 30 years has become one of the most influential and controversial figures in basketball through his work at various shoe companies . " I 've watched all the name-calling all these years . We 're the only sport that occupies a teenager 's life that fights with each other and calls each other names . I was the designated piata . Of all the things I have done , this will be the best thing I have ever done in my life . If I get them all on the same page , I will be the happiest man walking . The one entity we have to protect is the kid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific plan is being considered , the idea of an academy has gained momentum in a year in which the United States finished a disappointing third in the world championship in Japan and revelations about questionable academic practices at several high schools caught the attention of both NCAA and NBA officials . <p> " There is definitely something in the air , " R.C. Buford , general manager of the San Antonio Spurs , said of the momentum gathering behind the idea . " Our overall development structure for basketball needs to be addressed and provided with a systematic structure . We have seen the success of systematic structures in other areas " of the world . <p> NCAA spokesman Erik Christianson confirmed that a conference call initiated by Vaccaro took place and that Lennon was among those who participated . <p> " The academic preparation and success of our student-athletes is in the forefront of our minds as we consider these issues , " Christianson said . <p> In Vaccaro 's plan , a high-class training facility would house several dozen players who would sleep , eat and train there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more high schools , which would be located in the relative vicinity of the training academy . The high schools where the teenagers would complete course work would be " highly recognized academically , " Vaccaro said , and not " diploma mills " such as those that came under scrutiny following a series of articles in The Washington Post and New York Times . <p> Under Vaccaro 's plan , the academy would consist of teenagers from ninth through 12th grade , with the intention that players would spend a few years at the academy . Vaccaro has not specifically identified a site for the academy , only the need for good area schools and top-notch training facilities . The Los Angeles area is one possibility . <p> No postgraduates would participate in the program , which means those who graduate would still have a year to play in college or overseas before they would be eligible to enter the NBA draft . A selection committee each year would invite players , who then would complete applications . A player could only lose his scholarship because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet athletic expectations . <p> " If it could happen , it would be a very positive thing , " Kansas Coach Bill Self said of Vaccaro 's idea . " From the NCAA standpoint , they talk all the time about student-athlete welfare . Would this be good for a potential student-athlete ? Based on the way you explained it to me , how could it not be if in fact academics are a key component . " <p> The academy would field two teams that would play a national schedule throughout the traditional basketball season , with many of the games on television . Funding for the tuition and the academy 's expenses during the school year would come from individuals and corporate sponsors , said Vaccaro , who expects high-profile , younger NBA players to contribute as well . <p> " It 's an interesting concept , " Villanova Coach Jay Wright said . " Sonny has always been at the forefront of that type of thinking . What makes USA basketball different is that we are concerned with kids ' academics . We do n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as just basketball players . That 's not enough for anybody . This idea addresses both issues . " <p> During the summers , Vaccaro 's plan is for the academy 's players to take part in a two-month-long camp in Colorado Springs under the auspices of USA Basketball , where international basketball rules would be in place at least most of the time . <p> Under that plan , many elite players would not participate in the shoe company-sponsored camps and tournaments that have long dominated the summer scene . Vaccaro hopes for the Colorado Springs event to be one in which college coaches would be permitted to scout players . <p> " I think that would be something that would be positive , " Self said . " No matter what is done , there are still hundreds of potential scholarship players out there that need to be seen . But it does n't seem like to me that Nike camps or ABCD camps would be quite as important if you do n't have the best players there . " <p> Self added that such a structured system would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches . Over the past decade , the influence summer league coaches has had over players has increased to such an extent that the role of the high school coach has been marginalized . Renardo Sidney , a highly regarded sophomore who lives in California , has gained national acclaim only from playing summer league basketball . Sidney said he does not feel he needs high school basketball to make the NBA . <p> " What needs to be done is that young players are put in a system where there is more high-level coaches working with these kids , more mentors at a young age , " said Chris Wallace , general manager of the Boston Celtics . " Those type of individuals have influence with those kids on a day-to-day basis , not just the guy down the street that 's got his eyes on attracting the player to an agent or a traveling coach . " <p> One summer league coach acknowledged the creation of an academy could hurt Amateur Athletic Union basketball , but said that he would have no hesitation recommending that a player attend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A lot of moms and dads may not want their son to go away , but some moms and dads may want to send their son because it 's a sure shot at a big payday later , " said the coach , who requested anonymity because he did not wish to affect any of his current relationships . " There would be a lot of people who would want to get their hands in on the academy . There would be an Adidas Academy and a Nike Academy . " <p> Vaccaro addressed that concern in part by saying he would step away from his employment with Reebok by the time the academy would open , possibly as soon as September 2008 . <p> " I 'm not looking for a job , " he said . " I want to end it this way . I would walk away . This is the end . " <p> He also said shoe companies " all want to be a part of it , so you rotate it . Maybe this year they wear Nike , the next they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't put it under one umbrella . " <p> The academy , in some respects , would be similar to the Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton , Fla. , which has molded such champions as Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras and the Williams sisters , Venus and Serena . <p> " It seems like the seeds for this type of project are being germinated right now , " said Wallace , who has not been privy to discussions about the academy . " I would not be at all surprised that in the next two to four years what is now being talked about becomes reality . I 've long felt that there needed to be some mechanism in place where the truly gifted players are identified and then nurtured . I 'm sure this is done in music , done in the sciences , done in other sports . So why not basketball ? "
