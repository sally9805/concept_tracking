From : charley@whiffle.com To : cassie@natterjack.com Subject : cracked jugs-daft buggers-&amp; tank traps <p> Hi Cass ! <p> Hows things in darkest Africa ? Wierd &amp; wonderful-I bet-but not so w&amp;w as what weve got here at Willingden Farm . Go on-guess ! OK-give up ? <p> Houseguests ! <p> &amp; I do nt mean awful Uncle Ernie on one of his famous surprise visits . These are strangers ! <p> What happened-at last after our awful wet summer Augusts turned hot-not African hot but pretty steamy by Yorkshire standards . Dad &amp; George were working up in Mill Meadow . Mum asked if Id take them a jug of lemon barley-said it would please dad if I showed willing . Weve been in armed truce since I made it clear my plans had nt changed-ie do a postgrad thesis instead of getting a paid job-or better still-a wellpaid husband-&amp; settling down ! But no reason not to show willing - plus it gave me an excuse to drive the quad-so off I went . <p> Forgot the mugs-but dad did nt say anything-just drank straight out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was pleased . In fact we were having a pleasant chat when suddenly old Fang let out a growl . Lost half his teeth &amp; cant keep up with the sheep anymore-but still manages a grand growl . Dad looked round to see what had woken him-&amp; his face went into Headbanger configuration . <p> - whats yon daft bugger playing at ? - he demanded . <p> Youll recall that in dads demography anyone living outside Willingden parish is a daft bugger till proved innocent . In this case I half-agreed with him . <p> The DB in question was driving his car fast up the lane alongside Mill Meadow . How he got through the gate I do nt know . The HB had to take his chain &amp; lock off after the Ramblers took him to court last year-but he s fixed a catch like one of them old metal puzzles we used to play with as kids . Maybe the DB just got lucky-he thought ! <p> He was driving one of these new hybrid 4 x 4s-you know-conscience without inconvenience ! - &amp; when he saw how good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees ! - remember ? ) - he mustve thought-great ! - now for a bit of safe off-roading . <p> What he did nt reckon on was what George calls dads tank trap - the drainage ditch where the lane bends beyond the top gate &amp; steepens up to the mill ruin . <p> New tourist map came out last year-with water mill marked-no mention of ruin . Result-a lot of DBs decided this meant Heritage Centre-guided tours &amp; cream teas ! After losing out to the Ramblers-dad was forced to accept " bearded wierdies " trekking across his empire-but the sight of cars crawling up his lane drove him crazy . So one day he got to work with the digger-&amp; when hed finished-the drainage ditch extended across the lane-a muddy hollow a hippo could wallow in-the tank trap ! <p> Most drivers flee at the sight of it-but this DB obviously thought his hybrid could ford rivers &amp; climb Alps-&amp; just kept going . <p> Bad decision . <p> For 30 secs the wheels sent out glutinous brown jets-like a cow with colic-then the car slipped slowly sideways-finishing at 45 degrees-driver side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-said the HB with some satisfaction . <p> Moment later the passenger door was flung back . First thing out was a floppy brimmed sunhat-sort posh lady gardeners wear in the old Miss Marple movies . Beneath it was a woman who started to drag herself out-followed by a scream from below-suggesting shed stood on some bit of the driver not meant to be stood on . <p> She looked round in search of help-&amp; there we were-me-dad-George-&amp; Fang-staring back at her from 50 yds . <p> - help ! - she called-please-can you help me ? - <p> George &amp; me looked at the HB-G because he knows his place-me because I was curious what hed do . <p> If it had been a man I doubt hed have moved-not without serious negotiation . But this was a woman doing what women ought to do-calling for male assistance . <p> - reckon wed best take a look-he said-we meaning him &amp; George-of course . <p> He drained the lemon barley-thrust the jug into my hands like I was a docile milkmaid-&amp; set off toward the accident-G close behind-even old Fang got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sods Law-hit a stone &amp; cracked. -O shit ! -I said . It was that old earthenware one thats been around forever . I knew the HB would reckon bringing out the lemon barley in anything else would be like serving communion wine from a jam jar . O well-from now on hell have to make do with a plastic bottle ! <p> I set off after them . This was the first mildly interesting thing to happen since I came home-&amp; I wasnt going to miss it . <p> Woman was thin &amp; wispy-bonnet askew-big straw shoulder bag round her neck like a horses feed sack . She looked so worried I thought the driver must be seriously injured-but now I know its just a couple of notches up from her normal expression of unfocused anxiety . Another thing I noticed-words sprayed on the car door-pro job-elegant cursive script- Sandytown-Home of the Healthy Holiday . <p> She was saying-please can you get my husband out ? I think he s hurt himself- <p> - no- Im fine-came a mans voice-really-just a sprain-nothing in the world to worry about dear- aargh ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wifes waist level . Gingery hair-soft brown eyes in a narrow mobile face-not bad looking even with a bloodied nose-mid to late 30s . He was trying a social smile-till presumably he put more weight on his ankle than it could take . <p> George jumped up on the side of the vehicle-hooked his hands under the womans armpits-&amp; swung her clear of the muddy sump into dads arms . At 18-G makes Arnie Schwarzenegger look like a hobbit ! On our skiing trip last December ( yeah that one-when I hooked up with lousy Liam ) -I could have rented G out to my mates by the hour . In fact-if you count free rounds of glnhwein as rental-thats exactly what I did ! <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
