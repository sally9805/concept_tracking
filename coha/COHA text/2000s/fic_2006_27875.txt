The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette A Novel By Erickson , Carolly St. Martin 's Griffin Erickson , Carolly June 17 , 1769 My name is Archduchess Maria Antonia , called Antoinette , and I am thirteen years and seven months old , and this is the record of my life . Writing in this journal is my punishment . Father Kunibert , my confessor , has told me to write down all my sins in this journal so that I may reflect on them and pray for forgiveness . " Write ! " he said , pushing the book toward me , his thick white eyebrows going up , making him look ferocious . " Write what you have done ! Confess ! " " But I have done nothing wrong , " I tell him . " Write it down . Then we will see . Put there everything you did , starting with last Friday . And leave nothing out ! " Very well , I will put down in this book all that I did on the day I went to see Josepha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Kunibert what I have written and make my confession . Tomorrow I will begin . June 18 , 1769 It is very hard and sad to write what happened , because I am so very sorry that my sister was in such pain . I tried to tell Father Kunibert this , but he just opened the journal and handed me the box of sharpened quills . He is a hard man , as Carlotta says . He does not listen toexplanations . On Friday morning , then , this is what I did . I borrowed a plain black cloak and hood from my maid Sophie , and put a silver crucifix around my neck such as the Sisters of Mercy wear . I prepared a basket with fresh loaves and a ripe cheese and some strawberries from the palace garden . Without telling Sophie or anyone else where I was going , I went at night to the old abandoned stables where I was sure my sister Josepha was being kept . Josepha had been missing for a week , ever since she became hot with fever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , so I had to find out by asking the servants . Servants know everything that happens in the palace , even what goes on between the master and mistress in the privacy of their bedroom . I found out from Eric , the stable boy who grooms my riding horse Lysander that there was a sick girl in the basement of the old riding school . He had seen the Sisters of Mercy going there at night , and once he saw our court physician Dr. Van Swieten go in and come out again very quickly , holding a handkerchief over his mouth and looking very pale . I was sure my sister Josepha was there , lying in the dark probably , sick and lonely , waiting to die . I had to go to her . I had to tell her that she was not forgotten or abandoned . So I wrapped the black cloak around me and went out . The candle I carried guttered in the wind as I crossed the courtyard and made my way along the arcaded walkway and out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding school , no one ever went there and no horses were kept tethered in its stalls . I tried to keep my thoughts on Josepha , but my fear rose as I entered the dark building with its high domed ceiling . Dim shapes loomed up amid the darkness . When I shone my light on them they turned out to be cupboards for harnesses and empty bins that had once held hay . All was silent , except for the creaking of the old timbers in the roof and the distant calling of the palace sentinels as they made their rounds . I found steps leading down into more darkness . I started to go down , praying that my candle would not go out , and trying not to think of the stories Sophie liked to tell about the palace ghost , the Gray Lady who walked weeping through the corridors at night and sometimes flew in at the windows . " Do n't be foolish , Antonia , " my mother would say when I asked her about the Gray Lady , " there are no ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not live on as disembodied spirits . Only peasants believe such nonsense . " I respected my mother 's wisdom , but I was n't sure about the ghosts . Sophie had seen the Gray Lady several times , she said , and many others had seen her too . To keep my mind off ghosts I called out to Josepha as I descended the stairs . I thought I heard a weak cry . I called out again , and this time I was sure I heard an answer . But the voice I heard was not my sister 's . Josepha had a strong , laughing voice . The voice I heard now was pinched and thin , and terribly anxious . " Do n't come any nearer , whoever you are , " it said . " I have the pox . If you come near me you will die . " " I hear you , I 'm almost there , " I called out , ignoring the warning . I found her in a small , cell-like room where a lantern hanging from a nail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but gag , the stench in the room was so overwhelming . A powerful , cloying odor , not the odor of decay or dirt but a sickly , ghastly stench of rot . From where she lay in her narrow bed Josepha lifted one weak arm as if to ward me off . " Please , dearest Antonia , turn back . Go back . " I was crying . What the weak lantern-light showed me was monstrous . Josepha 's skin was purple , and full of blisters . Her face was swollen and red , her cheeks puffed out grotesquely , and there was blood dripping from her nose . Her eyes were bloodshot . " I love you , " I said through my tears . " I am praying for you . " I put down the basket , wondering whether rats would come and eat the food I had brought . But then I thought , the smell in this room is so terrible not even rats would come near . " I am so thirsty , " came the voice from the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had brought and set it beside Josepha 's bed . With difficulty she raised herself , reached for the bottle and drank . I could tell she was having trouble swallowing . " Oh , Antonia , " she said when she had put the bottle down , " I have such terrible dreams ! Fire coming down , and burning us all up . Mother on fire , screaming . Father , laughing while he watches us all burn . " " It is only the sickness that makes you dream such things . We are all safe , there is no fire . " But there is , I thought . There is the fire of the cowpox , that makes Josepha burn with fever and turns her brain to madness . " You must have medicine , you must get well . " " The sisters give me brandy and valerian , but it does n't help . I know they have given up on me . " " I have not . I will come back , I promise . " " No . Stay away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fainter . She was going to sleep . " Dear Antonia . . . " My tears were falling fast , but I knew I could n't stay . I could n't risk being missed . No one knew where I had gone , I had n't even told Carlotta , with whom I share my bedroom . So I left Josepha , and went back up the dark stairs and out through the old riding school and back along the torchlit arcade to the palace . The next day I was in the room when Dr. Van Swieten came to see my mother the empress . My brother Joseph , who is twenty-six and who has just buried his second wife , was also there . Ever since our father died , our mother has looked to Joseph for help in governing her many lands . One day after she dies Joseph will rule them all , so he needs to learn . Already he has the firmness that my mother says all rulers need . But I have heard her say to Count Khevenhller that Joseph does not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need if he is to rule well . " What of Josepha ? " my mother asked the doctor as he bowed and murmured " Your imperial highness . " " It is the black pox . " I saw my mother blanch , and Joseph turn his face away . The black pox was the severest kind of cowpox . No one ever survived it . When there was black pox in Vienna we children were always taken away at once into the country , so that we would not become ill . Servants with black pox were turned out of the palace and sent as far away as possible . None ever returned . And now my sister Josepha was dying of it too . " It is perfectly horrifying , " the doctor was saying . " I have seen it often before . There is no point in trying to preserve life once the pox takes hold . The archduchess can not be saved . She can only make others ill . " " Is she receiving every care ? " I heard my mother ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and the dairymaids . " It was well known that dairymaids were spared from being struck down with the cowpox . For some reason , they could care for sick people without fear of becoming sick themselves . " No one must know who she is , " Joseph boomed out . " No one from the court must be allowed near her . We can not have another outbreak of Pox Fear , like last summer . " Whenever the cowpox appeared , people panicked . The entire town caught the Pox Fear . There were frenzied efforts to escape the sickness . Terrified householders , trying to flee , were trampled or crushed to death . No one wanted the Pox Fear to invade the palace , where hundreds of servants and officials lived in close quarters and served the empress and our family . " That is understood , " Dr. Van Swieten said . " The archduchess is being kept where no one will find her . " I almost spoke up then , but managed to hold my tongue . Standing beside my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware that she was trembling . " I ca n't lose any more of my children , " she was saying . " First my dear Karl , and then Johanna , only eleven when she died , poor girl , and now my lovely Josepha , so young , and about to be married --  " " You have ten of us left , maman . " Joseph 's voice was cutting . He knew that although he was the eldest son , and our mother 's heir , she had preferred Karl , and loved him more . " Surely ten children is a sufficient number . " I am fond of my brother Joseph , but he does not understand what it is to love someone . When our father died four years ago he did not weep , but snorted with contempt . " He was a lazy do-nothing , surrounded by idle hangers-on , " I heard him say . He refused even to lay a wreath on father 's grave , though he did offer his arm to mother at the funeral . Joseph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not grieve for either of his wives when they died , or for the poor little dead baby his first wife gave him . Joseph is hard for me to understand . " How much longer will she live ? " Joseph asked Dr. Van Swieten . " A few days perhaps . " " When she dies , have the body taken away quickly . Let there be no announcement . She will not be missed . One excess daughter more or less --  " " Joseph ! That will do . " My mother spoke firmly , but I could hear the panic in her voice . But my brother , in his bitterness , went on . " And I want the body burned . Along with all her clothes and effects . " " Enough ! What you propose is unchristian . I will never allow it . You forget yourself . " " Such foolishness ! " I heard Joseph mutter . " To believe that some day all the bodies of the dead will sit up in their graves , and come back to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will abide by the teachings of the church , " my mother said quietly . " We are not heathens , or sectarians . Besides , Josepha is still alive . And while she lives , there is hope . I will retire now to my chapel to pray for her . And I recommend that you do the same . " To the doctor she said , " I want to be informed if there is any change in her condition . " At this I could keep still no longer . " Oh maman , there is such a terrible change in her . You would not believe it ! " Tears ran down my face as I spoke . My mother looked down at me , her eyes grave . Joseph glared at me in fury . Dr. Van Swieten gasped . " Explain yourself , Antonia , " said mother calmly . " I have seen her . She is all puffed up , and black and purple , and she smells horrible . And they keep her in a dark rathole under the old riding school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into my mother 's eyes . " She 's dying , maman . She 's dying . " Instead of enfolding me in her black silk skirts , as I expected her to do , my mother took several steps back from me , so that I could no longer smell her familiar smell , a combination of ink and rosewater . " Your imperial highnesses must withdraw , " Dr. Van Swieten said to my mother and Joseph , who were both putting more distance between themselves and me . " I will take charge of her . She will be watched for signs of the black pox . " He motioned to one of the tall footmen standing at the back of the large room , waiting for orders . " Send for my assistant , at once . And the dairymaids . " I was taken to the old guards ' quarters and kept there , watched by two village women , one old , one young , until they were certain I was not going to become sick like my sister . All my clothes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was putting them on a note fell out . It was from my sister Carlotta . " Dearest Antoinette , " she wrote , " how brave you were , to visit poor Josepha . Everyone knows what you did . We all have to pretend to disapprove but we admire you . I hope you do n't get sick . Joseph is angry . I love you . " July 3 , 1769 I have decided not to show this book to Father Kunibert . It will be my record , my private journal , of my life . Mine alone . So much has happened to me in the past several weeks . I have been kept away from poor Josepha , who died on the third day after I visited her . I try not to think of her in her suffering , but I know I will never forget how she looked , there in her cot , when I found her . Father Kunibert says I must reflect on my disobedience , and pray to be forgiven . He says I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful , only full of sorrow . I was not allowed to attend the brief funeral mass for Josepha , because I was still being watched by the dairymaids , who inspected my hands and arms and face every morning and evening for pox blisters and murmured to one another and shook their heads over me . I have thought about death , and how Josepha only had seventeen years on earth , so brief a season ! Why do some die and some live ? I can write no more about this , I am too full of sorrow . July 15 , 1769 Finally Dr. Van Swieten has let me return to the apartments I share with Carlotta . I do not have the cowpox . July 28 , 1769 This morning Sophie got me up early and dressed me with extra care . I asked her why but she would n't tell me . I knew it had to be something important when I saw her bring out my pale blue silk ball gown with the silver lam trim and the pink satin rosettes on the bodice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a silver-gray wig put over it . The wig was becoming , and made me look very old I thought , especially when Sophie threaded pearls through it . I have always been told that I look like my father , who was very handsome . Like him I have a wide forehead and large eyes set far apart . My eyes are light blue like my mother 's and she likes me to dress in blue to bring out their color . I could tell , as Sophie dressed me , that she was satisfied with the effect . She smiled to herself and hummed as she worked . Sophie has been my maid ever since I was seven years old and she was fifteen , and she knows me better than anyone , better even than my mother and Carlotta . When I was ready I was taken into the grand salon where my mother was . There were several men with her , and they all stared hard at me as I entered the room and walked to my mother 's side . " Antonia , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Choiseul . " Both men bowed to me and I inclined my head in acknowledgment , feeling the unaccustomed weight of the wig as I did so . My dancing master Monsieur Noverre came forward and signaled for the court musicians to play . He led me in the polonaise and then the allemande as the gentlemen watched closely . My harp was brought forward and I played several simple tunes -- I am not a very accomplished harpist -- and I sang an aria by Herr Gluck who had taught me to play the clavichord when I was younger . Trays of coffee and pastries were brought in and I sat with my mother and the prince and the duke talking of one thing and another . I felt rather foolish in my ball gown but we passed a pleasant half-hour chatting , and I did my best to answer the questions put to me , questions about everything from my religious education to my knowledge of geography and history to my ideas about marriage . " Naturally you hope to marry one day , " Prince Kaunitz said amiably . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One who loves her husband dearly , as my mother loved my father . " " And presents him with sons , " the Duc de Choiseul added . " Yes , of course . And daughters too , if the lord wills it . " " To be sure . Daughters too . " " Do you believe , archduchess , that a wife must obey her husband in all things ? " I thought for a moment . " I hope that when I marry , my husband and I will decide together what is best , and act as one . " The two men looked at one another , and I thought I saw a faint look of amusement in their faces . " Thank you , Archduchess Antonia , for your frankness and your courtesy . " My mother and the men rose and walked the length of the enormous room , deep in conversation . " Physically , she is perfect , " the duke said . " Her education has been inadequate , but she can be taught . There is great charm --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , " I heard my mother add . They took their time , walking and talking , Prince Kaunitz gesticulating , the duke more measured , more calculated in his movements and his tone . " This is the alliance we have long hoped for , " I heard my mother say . " The union of Hapsburg and Bourbon will secure our fortune , long after I am gone . " " Austria is not our enemy , " the duke said . " Britain is . We must fortify ourselves against Britain . " " And we must fortify ourselves against Prussia , " Prince Kaunitz countered . " The interests of both Austria and France will be served by this marriage . And the sooner it is made , the better . " ... Continues ... by Erickson , Carolly
