<p> The quarters clink in the jar , and cookies fly off the table at Huff Elementary School in Redwood City , Calif . Laura Mabbott 's fifth-graders are having a bake sale to protect a coral reef thousands of miles away . " If reefs 3,000 miles away die out , " says student Nina Maksimova , " we are wounded . " <p> The John Gray Recyclers are busy , too . These high school students live in the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean . They 've collected small mountains of trash from island beaches , organized recycling programs , written songs about the ocean , and raised money to save the endangered Cayman blue iguana . " I feel my generation is the conserving generation , " says high-schooler Cathrine Welds in an e-mail . <p> An ocean away on the Pacific island of Guam , students are just as committed . The Marine Mania Club at George Washington High School is organizing its own beach cleanup . The " Maniacs " also monitor sea-turtle nests , plant trees to keep soil from washing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fishermen . The lost nets can entangle and kill turtles , fish , and dolphins . <p> " Being in Marine Mania is a way for me to give back to the environment , " says Felix Santiago via e-mail . " When we work together " adds fellow student Joseph Barrett , " it no longer seems like work . " <p> Earth Day is also Ocean Day <p> Ms. Mabbott 's fifth-graders , the John Gray Recyclers , and the Marine Maniacs are just a few of the kids worldwide who will celebrate this Earth Day ( April 22 ) as " Dive In To Earth Day . " <p> Earth Day was first celebrated in 1970 to remind people to care for the environment . " But most Earth Day events take place on land , " says Brian Huse , director of the Coral Reef Alliance ( CORAL ) in San Francisco . Dive In To Earth Day began in 2000 " to ensure that the 70 percent of the earth that is covered by water is not forgotten . " <p> Since 2000 , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 89 countries . Students , dive clubs , aquariums , and conservation groups organize fish surveys , underwater cleanups , art contests , and more . The day reminds people how much we depend on oceans and how much they need protection . <p> You probably know that plants produce oxygen for us to breathe . But you may not know that most of that oxygen is generated not by land plants , but by immense numbers of phytoplankton ( tiny marine plants ) floating in the ocean . Oceans slow global warming by absorbing greenhouse gases humans pump into the atmosphere . And oceans provide food for billions of people . <p> Humans can harm even huge oceans without noticing or understanding the damage they 're doing . " People just think of the ocean as a free food outlet or a trash can , " says fifth-grader Andy Haughey . <p> Global warming kills reef-building corals , which are sensitive to small changes in temperature . Fertilizer , pesticides , untreated sewage , and garbage can kill sealife . Overfishing has eliminated 90 percent of all large fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't see what 's going on under the sea , " says fifth-grader Amanda Sibrian . " It can take years until people come to say , ' Why ca n't we catch any more big fish ? ' " <p> Some kids get involved in marine conservation because they 've seen problems first-hand . Cayman Islander Cathrine Welds says her eyes were opened when she saw a Cayman reef smashed by a yacht anchor . " It was a sad and shocking scene when I snorkeled out there and saw the damage , " she says via e-mail . <p> A Cayman beach cleanup helped classmate Melissa Smith see the need for action : " We filled 13 huge garbage bags , " she says , " and we had just the week before conducted a cleanup ! " <p> No island is an island <p> The California students study different islands around the world and learn how our environment connects us . " Everyone has heard the phrase , ' no man is an island , ' " Mabbott says . " The kids learn that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years ago , Mabbott asked her fifth-graders to raise $ 5 each to contribute to Seacology , an environmental group based in Berkeley , Calif. , that works with islanders around the world . But her students wanted to do more - much more . Last year they raised $ 3,650 . Besides having bake sales at recess , they washed cars , sold T-shirts , and asked for donations instead of presents at birthdays . This year they 've raised more than $ 3,000 . The money will pay for a village kindergarten in Fiji . In exchange , villagers will make part of their fishing grounds a marine reserve . <p> The students have made a difference . Duane Silverstein , Seacology 's executive director , says Mabbott 's class " set the example . " Other schools heard about Mabbott 's fifth-graders and were inspired to help , too . Word even reached the John Gray Recyclers in the Cayman Islands . <p> The Recyclers have their own reefs to protect . But the Cayman students wanted to help Fijians , too . " We are helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that the world around us is like one huge chain , " writes teenager Jeremy Forbes , president of the Recyclers . " We are all linked together . " <p> When the Recyclers won a $ 1,550 Commonwealth Youth Award , they gave the money to Seacology . Another Fijian village will get a kindergarten in exchange for creating a marine reserve . Five of the Recyclers plan to travel to Fiji for the opening of the kindergarten along with their teacher , Christine Whitehead . <p> Sometimes protecting the ocean requires speaking out , even when others disagree . The Marine Maniacs protested a " Birdman Rally " at a newly established marine reserve in Guam . Competitors ( mostly Japanese tourists ) built large hang-gliderlike kites and ran off a large ramp into the water . " The reef flat is a prime snorkeling location and could have been damaged by the ramp and the crash landing of kites and people , " notes teacher Linda Tatreau . The Maniacs also thought it was unfair that fishermen were excluded , but not foreign tourists . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guam . Shark-fin soup is popular in many Asian countries . When shark finners catch a shark , they slice off its fins and throw the shark back in the water to die . The Maniacs began a petition and performed skits on shark finning at local schools . Students wrote letters to restaurants serving shark-fin soup asking them to stop . Students got many nasty replies from restaurants , but that did n't stop them . <p> The Birdman Rally was held despite the protest . But shark finning was recently banned in all United States waters , including the waters around Guam . ( Guam is a US territory . ) <p> Events planned worldwide <p> Laura Mabbott 's class , the John Gray Recyclers and the Marine Maniacs will all celebrate Dive In To Earth Day 2004 . Mabbott 's class will " dive in " by telling fellow students about marine conservation and by giving Seacology the money they 've raised for Fiji . The Recyclers plan to give media interviews on marine dumping and littering . They also plan to visit local schools . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is truly a joy for me , " writes student Cheyenne Rankin . And in Guam , the Maniacs will monitor sea-turtle nests and stencil warnings on storm drains . The stencils will remind people not to dump harmful chemicals into waterways that flow into the sea . <p> The students in California , the Cayman Islands , and Guam will have plenty of company . Dive In To Earth events now account for a quarter of all Earth Day activities . Notes Recycler Melissa Brown , " My hope and desire is to see people come to appreciate and take care of what we have been so greatly blessed with , a clean and beautiful environment in which to live .
