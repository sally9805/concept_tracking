Storm-tossed sand offers a record of ancient cyclones <p> The transformation was stunning : One moment a nondescript tropical storm , the next , a hurricane of an intensity no American alive had ever experienced . The storm did not grow through some gradual accretion of power ; it exploded forth like something escaping from a cage . The Weather Bureau of 1900 had a code word for winds of 150 miles an hour-extreme-but no one in the bureau seriously expected to use it . Erik Larson , Isaac 's Storm ( 1999 , Crown ) <p> <p> On September 9 , 1900 , the impossible destroyed Galveston , Texas . A fierce hurricane roared over the thriving coastal city that day , flooding its island with water and claiming more than 6,000 lives , about 1 in every 5 residents . The storm arrived with almost no warning . The U.S. Weather Bureau had ignored forecasts of Cuban meteorologists , noting that a severe hurricane had never before hit the town . <p> Judged simply on its strength , the hurricane that leveled Galveston a century ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a category 4 storm-one with sustained winds of 131 to 155 miles per hour . Few of those monsters ever arise in the Atlantic Ocean 's hurricane breeding grounds , let alone smash into the U.S. mainland . In the past 150 years , fewer than a dozen have struck the U.S. coast along the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic . <p> The most catastrophic hurricanes , known as category 5 , are even more uncommon . Just two have run into the United States in the past century . In 1935 , on Labor Day , one flattened the Florida Keys . In 1969 , Hurricane Camille roared through Mississippi . <p> The infrequency of severe hurricanes is welcome news , of course . Yet it also poses a problem . Reliable data on hurricane landfalls in the United States is available only for the past 150 years . And given the small number of category 4 and 5 storms during that relatively short time span , scientists do n't have enough statistical power to estimate confidently how frequently catastrophic hurricanes strike the U.S. coastline . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look further back in time . As part of a fledgling discipline called paleotempestology , they 've begun to search for signs of hurricanes that predate recorded history . <p> At the forefront of this effort is Kam-biu Liu of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge . By unearthing sand layers deposited by massive hurricanes in coastal lakes and marshes , his research group has identified storms that have struck the U.S. coast over the past 5,000 years . In February , Liu described his results at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington , D.C. <p> " It 's the first time we 've been able to peer back before the historical record to see how hurricanes vary in time , " says Kerry A. Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who would like to use such data to test whether the anticipated global warming will increase the number of severe hurricanes . <p> Scientists are n't alone in taking an interest in paleotempestology . Most of the field 's funding comes from the Risk Prediction Initiative , an effort bankrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict the odds of a severe hurricane landfall in a specific region . Considering that category 4 and 5 hurricanes can cause billions of dollars in damage , the future of these insurance companies may rest on the accuracy of their estimates . <p> Paleotempestology " is a nice scientific challenge , but it 's also got a very practical outcome , " notes Thompson Webb III of Brown University in Providence , R.I. , who has conducted work similar to Liu 's . <p> When the category 4 hurricane ripped through Galveston in 1900 , wind and rain alone produced significant damage and some loss of life . But as in many such tempests , the real killer was the flooding by the storm surge . Hurricane winds blowing over shallows near a coastline can raise up a dome of salt water 50 to 100 miles across . This storm surge can send up to 25 feet of water into the region where a hurricane makes landfall . <p> If a lake or marsh sits not far from the coast , the storm surge may also leave an enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beach can be thrown inland with the water , eventually settling to the bottom of the lakes or marshes in a discernible sediment layer that records the storm 's impact . <p> In 1990 , Liu and his graduate student Miriam L. Fearn began to look for such sand layers at Lake Shelby , just off the Alabama coast ( SN : 9/18/93 , p. 191 ) . They drilled into the lake bottom , removing cores of sediment ranging from 1 to 10 meters deep . <p> A category 3 hurricane called Frederic had run through that region in 1979 . In cores taken on the edge of the lake nearest the coast , the two investigators found a surface stratum of sand , which they attributed to Frederic . Cores taken in the middle of the lake did n't contain this recent layer , indicating that the hurricane was n't fierce enough to send sand that far into the lake . Those cores did , however , hold 11 other sand layers , 0.1 to 1 centimeter thick , which Liu and Fearn concluded could only have resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricanes . <p> " There are no other high-energy events that would cause sand to be transported out into the middle of a lake , " contends Liu . <p> Through dating methods such as radiocarbon analysis of organic matter within the cores , the scientists were able to determine that nine of the lake 's sand layers originated between 2,200 and 3,300 years ago . The two more recent millennia each had one sand layer . <p> Over the past decade , Liu and his colleagues have drilled similar cores in 16 lakes and marshes along the Gulf Coast from Texas to Florida . For four of the sites-Pearl River Marsh in Louisiana , Pascagoula Marsh in Mississippi , Lake Shelby in Alabama , and Western Lake in Florida-the investigators obtained sediment cores going back about 5,000 years . <p> The historical record of the past 150 years clearly indicates that total hurricane activity along the U.S. coast varies decade by decade . When Liu 's team lined up their cores from the four sites , they realized that catastrophic storm activity rises and falls over longer periods , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . Our data suggest that there are much longer cycles superimposed on the decadal cycles , " says Liu . " We 've had a quiet period , an active period , and for the past 1,000 years , we 're back to a relatively quiet period . " <p> Indeed , the data indicate that catastrophic hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast much more frequently 1,000 to 3,500 years ago than they do now . During that hyperactive period , such storms hit the area from four to five times more often than they have in the past 1,000 years . <p> Combining the data on the past 3,500 years from several of their sites , the investigators conclude that a category 4 or 5 hurricane batters the Gulf Coast every 300 or so years . In other words , there 's about a 0.3 percent chance each year that the region will see a storm like the one that razed Galveston in 1900-or something even stronger . <p> This is the first time that scientists can provide insurance companies with an estimate of severe hurricane frequency that has any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was some initial skepticism that the sand layers observed in Liu 's coastal lake cores were truly from storm surges caused by ancient hurricanes . As his team has studied additional sites , other scientists have grown more comfortable with the strategy . <p> " I feel pretty confident that they 're seeing a storm record . There 's no other way to explain how you get a big sand layer , " says David L. Malmquist of the Bermuda Biological Station for Research in St. George 's , who heads the Risk Prediction Initiative . <p> It also helps that another research team has tried Liu 's strategy and is having similar success . During the past few years , Webb and Jeff Donnelly , also at Brown University , have led an effort to draw cores from coastal salt marshes in Rhode Island , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Connecticut . While their cores push only 600 to 1,000 years into the past , the scientists have matched many of their sand layers to hurricanes documented in the historical record . <p> " It was key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb . <p> Paleotempestology may help insurance companies better set their rates , but scientists also desire the field 's data to learn how climate influences hurricane activity . For example , what climatic changes could have caused the millennial shifts in hurricane activity along the Gulf Coast revealed by the cores ? <p> Liu hypothesizes that the shifting position of the Bermuda high explains the change in landfall frequency along the Gulf . A region of high atmospheric pressure in which air circulates clockwise , the Bermuda high has a strong influence on the climate of North America . <p> Scientists , for example , have attributed changing precipitation patterns in the United States over the past 10,000 years to shifts in the Bermuda high 's position . The central and the eastern parts of the country seesaw back and forth in receiving the greater amount of rain . <p> Liu suggests that his ancient hurricanes also follow an alternating pattern based on the Bermuda high . " If the high-pressure system is situated close to the continent and the Caribbean , then hurricanes tend to get steered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high sits far from North America , hurricanes instead usually head for the Atlantic coastline . <p> He 's now compiling coring data from sites in Virginia and Massachusetts to determine if ancient hurricane activity rises along the Atlantic Coast when it declines in the Gulf . <p> " The data so far show potential for supporting the hypothesis , but we need to do much more work , " says Liu . <p> Beyond looking for sand layers caused by storm surges , scientists are investigating novel ways to document ancient hurricanes . Liu , for example , has traveled across the Pacific Ocean-where hurricanes are usually called typhoons or cyclones-in an attempt to extend the historical record . <p> " In China , there are very good records kept at the county level . County gazettes record every significant cultural and natural event in the area , " he notes . <p> In a pilot project using the records of a province near Hong Kong , Liu has compiled a 1,000-year record of typhoon landfalls . It reveals variations in hurricane frequency on the scale of centuries as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science Foundation to fund a project that will explore the gazettes from provinces all along the China coast . <p> " This will be the longest tropical cyclone record in the world , " says Liu , who further hopes to take cores from coastal lakes in China to corroborate the hurricanes recorded in the gazettes . <p> There are also options other than sand layers and paper records . Scientists are considering coral , tree rings , pollen , caves , and even clam shells as indicators of cyclones . <p> A research team led by Bjorn Malmgren at the University of Goteborg in Sweden has begun to study the humic-acid content of coral from sites in the Caribbean . Humic acids in soil run off into the ocean during the heavy rainfalls of severe hurricanes , and corals incorporate the acids into their skeletons . Malmgren says that by measuring how the humic-acid content of corals varies with time , his group can develop a record of ancient tropical cyclones . <p> The fierce winds of major hurricanes can also shear off the crowns of tall trees , reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows up as thin tree rings . <p> Similarly , the destruction caused by catastrophic hurricanes can change the vegetation within a region for years , altering the kinds and quantities of pollen trapped in sediments of lakes , ponds , and marshes . Other phenomena that affect the pollen record , such as fires or human deforestation , complicate its use in identifying prehistoric hurricanes , however . <p> One of the more unusual , and unexplained , features of a hurricane is that its rain is isotopically lighter than normal , with a lower concentration of oxygen 18 than typical rainwater has . James R. Lawrence of the University of Houston made this discovery in 1989 while studying groundwater after a Texas hurricane . He and other scientists propose that hurricane rainfall seeping into caves may be incorporated as detectable layers within deposits such as stalagmites or stalactites . Lawrence has also suggested studying clams to see if the carbonate in their shells holds an isotopic record of hurricane rain . <p> Despite these efforts , the search for signs of ancient hurricanes remains in its infancy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Emanuel . " There 's just a handful of people doing this . " <p> That 's in large part , he adds , because federal agencies have n't embraced the interdisciplinary field , leaving the Risk Prediction Initiative as almost the only source of funding . <p> Yet to understand how a changing climate influences the number and intensity of hurricanes , scientists must turn to paleotempestology , argues Emanuel . He notes that predictions made by climate models on this issue do n't inspire confidence . One model suggests that global warming will increase hurricane frequency , while another foretells the exact opposite . <p> " I do n't think there 's any other way we 're going to get a handle on the relationship between hurricanes and climate except by looking back in time , " concludes Emanuel . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Galveston , Texas , after the 1900 hurricane that killed 20 percent of the city 's inhabitants <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A strip of sand separates Florida 's Lake Shelby from the Gulf of Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a colleague draw a core from the lake . <p> DIAGRAM : Sediment cores taken from coastal lakes and marshes contain sand layers deposited by catastrophic ancient hurricanes .
