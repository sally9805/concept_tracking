Section : Issues and Events <p> Name a member of the National Academy of Engineering who is a physicist and a lawyer , but not an engineer . Try Richard Meserve , whose illustrious and varied career attests to the success of marrying different disciplines . <p> It 's fashionable these days to combine a physics degree with , say , businesss or education . Such pairing of disciplines is considered a selling point for attracting students into physics and later , when they graduate , for landing them jobs . But that was n't always the case . In the mid-1970s , when Richard Meserve capped off his physics PhD with a law degree , the combination was unusual and was perceived by some to be a defection from physics . In the ensuing years , a career that has included clerking for a Supreme Court justice , serving as legal counsel to President Jimmy Carter 's science adviser , heading the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) , and  --  as of this past April leading the Carnegie Institution of Washington has borne out Meserve 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and science . " <p> Meserve 's doctoral research in applied physics at Stanford University involved calculating electronic properties of large molecules . As his PhD neared completion , he says , " I confronted the depths of the job depression for physicists . I had a family to support , and I knew many very good people who were hovering around universities and going through postdocs and further postdocs as they waited for positions to open up . That caused me to wonder , Does this make any sense ? " As an undergraduate in math and physics at Tufts University , Meserve had considered studying law  --  the profession of both his father and his older brother . " I retraced my steps and went on to law school at Harvard with the idea right from the beginning that I would try to use my scientific background in the practice of law , " he says . <p> His physics background was helpful right away , Meserve says . " A lot of the training of lawyers is focused on understanding the abstract principles that underlie the resolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of models and their consequences is completely natural to a scientist , particularly a physicist . " Meserve earned his law degree in 1975 and then returned to editing his PhD thesis , which earned him the title of doctor in 1976 . Science in litigation <p> After law school , Meserve clerked first for a judge in the highest court of Massachusetts , and then for Justice Harry Blackmun in the US Supreme Court . " I think I was intriguing to him because he had been a math major as an undergraduate . " says Meserve . One case that used Meserve 's analytical skills involved discrimination against Hispanics in the selection of grand juries in southern Texas . " I did a simple calculation of the probability that so few Hispanics would be on the juries . It turned out to be less than one chance in 10 20 that this was a random draw . " As a result of the Supreme Court opinion , says Meserve , " there are now a lot of lawyers who practice in the discrimination area who have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for four years starting in 1977 , was as legal counsel to Frank Press , President Carter 's science adviser . In that role , he was involved in a wide range of policy issues , from evaluating science budgets to kick-starting technology innovation to worrying about energy resources . " There was a lot of concern at that time about supply interruptions from the Middle East , so our office was very active in dealing with energy issues , " he says . And after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident , Meserve says he " ran the staff-level White House group that was responding to the disaster . " <p> After his stint in the White House , Meserve stayed in Washington , DC , and joined the law firm of Covington &; Burling , where , he says , " I was viewed as being the lawyer  --  scientist . " His first client was the American Physical Society . One series of international cases for which Meserve represented APS and the American Institute of Physics ( which publishes PHYSICS TODAY ) was a drawn-out dispute with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two articles in PHYSICS TODAY and one in the APS Bulletin that compared journal subscription prices and showed G &B's; to be among the costliest per thousand characters . The suits were decided in favor of APS and AIP ( see PHYSICS TODAY , June 2001 , page 10 ) . <p> The work he did for the physics organizations was " mostly routine , " says Meserve . But other clients made more use of his analytical skills . One memorable case involved an oil field in Iran . In 1979 , when the Shah was deposed and Ayatollah Khomeini came in , says Meserve , Iran " basically kicked out all of the American companies . My part in the case was figuring out how much oil my client would have recovered if it had n't been excluded from Iran . " Meserve presented and cross-examined witnesses on petroleum engineering issues in a special claims tribunal in the Hague . <p> Two Supreme Court cases that Meserve was involved in concerned the presentation of scientific and technical evidence . In the early 1990s , he represented the National Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which involved claims that a drug intended to appease morning sickness in pregnant women caused birth defects . The question was , he says , " What standards should govern the admission of scientific testimony that the drug could cause birth defects ? " Later , he represented the National Academy of Engineering in Kumho Tire Co v. Carmichael , which involved an alleged design defect in car tires . " The cases ultimately provide a safeguard to insulate juries from shoddy science , " says Meserve . " Now judges will typically have ' Daubert hearings ' to decide whether scientific evidence is sufficiently reliable and relevant to be heard . " <p> Joining the law firm was part of a long-range strategy , says Meserve . " I hoped that an interesting job in science policy might come along in the future  --  and that 's easier if you are already in Washington . " In 1999 , after 17 years at Covington &; Burling , one did come along . Nuclear resurgence <p> " The call came out of the blue , " says Meserve of the offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency that regulates civilian uses of nuclear materials . " It fit my strategy of trying to use law and science together . And it was an interesting job in any event . " Over the years , Meserve had chaired a host of committees for the National Academy of Sciences  --  dealing with , among other matters , control of weapons-grade nuclear material in Russia , the Chernobyl accident , and fuel efficiency of cars . He credits those studies with making him visible to the White House and , ultimately , landing him the top job at the NRC . <p> Nuclear energy , Meserve predicts , will play an increasing role in powering the US , which currently gets 20% of its electrical energy from 103 nuclear power plants . " There has been a resurgence in interest in nuclear power that I did not anticipate  --  I do n't think anyone anticipated , " says Meserve . Safety , waste , and proliferation are the concerns related to nuclear power , he adds . " I believe that all of those problems are solvable . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During his tenure , the NRC extended the operating lifetimes of some power plants from 40 to 60 years and certified designs for new reactors . " The next generation of reactors will have inherent safety features that do n't exist in the currently operating fleet of plants , " he says . <p> As NRC chair , Meserve took heat for the agency 's handling of the Davis-Besse nuclear plant near Toledo , Ohio . In late 2001 , the NRC granted the reactor operator a six-week extension before shutdown for an inspection required for all reactors of its type . When the inspection was carried out , an area of corrosion the size of a pineapple was found on the reactor 's pressure vessel head . Critics pointed accusing fingers at Meserve and the NRC for granting the extension and for the agency 's internal handling of the incident . For his part , Meserve says " it was a very serious incident . But it was not an accident  --  nothing happened . " Given the information available at the time , he adds , granting the postponement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the NRC commissioners known , they would never have let this plant continue . " The Davis-Besse reactor has not started up again because of ongoing repairs . <p> The biggest issue facing the NRC is Nevada 's Yucca Mountain , says Meserve . When the Department of Energy submits the anticipated application to bury spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste there , it will be up to the NRC to give the final go-ahead . But that decision will fall to Meserve 's successors . He left the agency in March , about a year before the end of his term , to become president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington . " It was an opportunity I could n't pass up , " he says . Cautious at Carnegie <p> The organization Meserve now heads is a patchwork of departments in six science areas . " It 's a very smoothly functioning organization , thanks to my predecessor , Maxine Singer , " says Meserve . " We are mid-flight on a whole series of initiatives she started . " Those include instruments for Carnegie 's telescopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developmental biologists on the Johns Hopkins University campus , and the establishment of a department of global ecology housed at Stanford University . The Carnegie Institution has a yearly operating budget of about $45 million , largely from its century-old endowment . Meserve 's first goal is to raise $75 million by the end of 2006 . " I want to be cautious about new priorities . First , we need to fulfill the commitments that have already been launched , " he says . <p> " I ca n't say that in any of my jobs I 've used PhD-level physics knowledge , " says Meserve . " But being comfortable with the things that physics teaches you , and knowing the science community , and being able to interact with scientists has been invaluable . " Looking back on his decision to combine physics and law , Meserve adds , " I had the sense that science was at the core of a lot of important public issues and that if there were n't some lawyers who had scientific training , it was a detriment to the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regulatory Commission , visiting the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant in Maryland in late 1999 . <p> By Toni Feder <p>
