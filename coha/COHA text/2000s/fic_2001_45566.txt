" TIME IS FLUID HERE , " SAID the demon . <p> He knew it was a demon the moment he saw it . He knew it , just as he knew the place was Hell . There was nothing else that either of them could have been . <p> The room was long , and the demon waited by a smoking brazier at the far end . A multitude of objects hung on the rock-gray walls , of the kind that it would not have been wise or reassuring to inspect too closely . The ceiling was low , the floor oddly insubstantial . <p> " Come close , " said the demon , and he did . <p> The demon was rake-thin , and naked . It was deeply scarred , and it appeared to have been , flayed at some time in the distant past . It had no ears , no sex . Its lips were thin and ascetic , and its eyes were a demon 's eyes : they had seen too much and gone too far , and under their gaze he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens now ? " he asked . <p> " Now , " said the demon , in a voice that carried with it no sorrow , no relish , only a dreadful flat resignation , " you will be tortured . " <p> " For how long ? " <p> But the demon shook its head and made no reply . It walked slowly along the wall , eyeing first one of the devices that hung there , then another . At the far end of the wall , by the closed door , was a cat-o ' - nine  --  tails made of frayed wire . The demon took it down with one three-fingered hand and walked back , carrying it reverently . It placed the wire tines onto the brazier , and stared at them as they began to heat up . <p> " That 's inhuman . " <p> " Yes . " <p> The tips of the cat 's tails were glowing a dead orange . <p> As the demon raised his arm to deliver the first blow , it said , " In time you will remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a liar . " <p> " No , " said the demon . " The next part , " it explained , in the moment before it brought down the cat , " is worse . " <p> Then the tines of the cat landed on the man 's back with a crack and a hiss , tearing through the expensive clothes , burning and rending and shredding as they struck and , not for the last time in that place , he screamed . <p> There were two hundred and eleven implements on the walls of that room , and in time he was to experience each of them . <p> When , finally , the Lazarene 's Daughter , which he had grown to know intimately , had been cleaned and replaced on the wall in the two-hundred  --  and-eleventh position , then , through wrecked lips , he gasped , " Now what ? " <p> " Now , " said the demon , " the true pain begins . " <p> It did . <p> Everything he had ever done that had been better left undone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or told to others . Every little hurt , and all the great hurts . Each one was pulled out of him , detail by detail , inch by inch . The demon stripped away the cover of forgetfulness , stripped everything down to truth , and it hurt more than anything . <p> " Tell me what you thought as she walked out the door , " said the demon . <p> " I thought my heart was broken . " <p> " No , " said the demon , without hate , " you did n't . " It stared at him with expressionless eyes , and he was forced to look away . <p> " I thought , now she 'll never know I 've been sleeping with her sister . " <p> The demon took apart his life , moment by moment , instant to awful instant . It lasted a hundred years , perhaps , or a thousand - they had all the time there ever was , in that gray room - and toward the end he realized that the demon had been right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ended . <p> And once it had ended , it began again . There was a self-knowledge there he had not had the first time , which somehow made everything worse . <p> Now , as he spoke , he hated himself . There were no lies , no evasions , no room for anything except the pain and the anger . <p> He spoke . He no longer wept . And when he finished , a thousand years later , he prayed that now the demon would go to the wall , and bring down the skinning knife , or the choke-pear , or the screws . <p> " Again , " said the demon . <p> He began to scream . He screamed for a long time . <p> " Again , " said the demon , when he was done , as if nothing had been said . <p> It was like peeling an onion . This time through his life he learned about consequences . He learned the results of things he had done ; things he had been blind to as he did them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had done to people he had never known , or met , or encountered . It was the hardest lesson yet . <p> " Again , " said the demon , a thousand years later . <p> He crouched on the floor , beside the brazier , rocking gently , his eyes closed , and he told the story of his life , re-experiencing it as he told it , from birth to death , changing nothing , leaving nothing out , facing everything . He opened his heart . <p> When he was done , he sat there , eyes closed , waiting for the voice to say , " Again , " but nothing was said . He opened his eyes . <p> Slowly , he stood up . He was alone . <p> At the far end of the room there was a door , and , as he watched , it opened . <p> A man stepped through the door . There was terror in the man's.face , and arrogance , and pride . The man , who wore expensive clothes , took several hesitant steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the man , he understood . <p> " Time is fluid here , " he told the new arrival . <p> Author Affiliation
