Chapter One : The Chocolate Crew New Orleans , Louisiana . The view of a handheld video camera widened . The date on the small view screen read THURS JAN 11-01 . The color was vivid and clear with the sun still up at 3:36 P.M. The picture enlarged to capture the full front view of the light-blue-painted two-story house . The paint job was bright and striking , with white trim that outlined the windows , the roof , and the one-car garage . There were three new wooden steps that were still unpainted , which led to a light-blue-and-white front porch . Four plastic white chairs sat out on the porch for lounging . And a white screen door shielded the heavy , light blue front door , which led into the house . " This is our home , sweet home , or at least for the meantime . " The camera zoomed in on the pleasant brown face of a college girl . Her hair was done in tight shoulder-length braids . She spoke right into the lens of the camera with poise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , that 's the outside . Now we 'll walk inside to meet my girls . They 're also my housemates . " The girl smiled wide for the camera with bright white teeth and smooth skin . " We call ourselves ' the chocolate crew ' because we 're all chocolate brown . But it 's not like we planned it that way , like we had color favoritism or anything . That 's just how it happened . " But anyway , let 's walk inside ... " The lens zoomed in as the camera moved forward and followed her through the front door . The view widened again inside the living room . The room had a plain white paint job , with no artwork or family portraits on the walls . It was a rented student house with a marble fireplace and shiny hardwood floors that were covered by large Oriental rugs . Two girls sat on the sofa to the left , with a third girl sitting inside the dining room that was straight ahead . " Okay , let me introduce myself first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host in braids spoke into the camera . She was excited and straightforward with her introduction . " My name is Bridget Chancellor , and I 'm from Ann Arbor , Michigan . I came here to Dillard University to enroll in the nursing program while experiencing the city of New Orleans . " " It 's N'awlins , girl . Not New Or-leans . You do n't know that by now ? You 've been here over a year already . Get that proper shit out ya ' voice . " The camera angled left to the two girls who sat on the sofa . The first one , who was closest to the camera , was plump , with short pressed hair that was curled at the edges . She hid her face to laugh when the bright light of the camera focused on her . The second girl , who had interrupted Bridget , wore a black bandanna around her head , with twisted hair that poked out in twenty different directions . She had all of the mouth in the world , and she hid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Yula Frederick and Ayanna Timber . " The camera zoomed in on Ayanna Timber , with the twisted hair and loud mouth . She responded accordingly , with her hands swaying , head bobbing , and mouth running to her own beat . " Yeah , I 'm the A-to-the-Y-A-double-N-A , and if you wants to play , then do n't swing my way , ' cause I 'll send you to a grave like a thug from the boulevard for trying to act hard . So do n't pull my card unless you 're ready to go , blow for blow , flow for flow , and now you know . " So who you wan na step to with your weak-ass crew , it ai n't the A-to-the-T from the chocolate girl crew , you 'll get your ass spiced up like a Leslie stew . " Laughter filled the room , including a grin from the fourth housemate , who sat alone in the dining room , before Bridget took control of the camera again . " Anyway , Ayanna 's from Houston  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot what she 's supposed to be studying because she changed her major three times already , " Bridget continued . Ayanna said , " It 's sociology . " " Whatever , " Bridget said . " You need to keep your mind on your work instead of your rapping . " " Shit , B , you need to keep your mind off your little Creole boyfriend who be over here every other night . " The camera angled left and right to keep up with their rapid conversation . When the view stopped on Bridget , she looked embarrassed . Ayanna was giving unscripted information . Bridget said , " Well , at least I still get my work done . And he does n't call himself a Creole . " She faced the camera to explain things further . " Um , Ayanna did n't mean B like in , you know , a B or anything like that . She just meant it , like , B for Bridget . " Laughter filled the room again . Ayanna said , " Girl , stop trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropologist or something with the way you always try to explain shit . Some things ai n't meant to be explained . " " And some words are not meant to be used all the time , " Bridget responded . " Well , anyway , " she said , moving on , " Yula Frederick is from Mobile , Alabama , and she 's a nursing major like I am . That 's how we met in our first semester , freshman year . " " Why do n't you shut up a minute and let Yula introduce herself ? " Ayanna snapped . Bridget sighed and did n't say another word . What use was it ? Ayanna was unruly . She was a disruptive force , where Bridget was raised on civility . The camera zoomed in and focused on Yula 's wide frame while she sat on the sofa . She watched it apprehensively . Then she dropped her reservations . She said , " Well , you know , we 're the chocolate girl crew or whatever , but it 's not just because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They laughed again . The camera zoomed out and focused on the fourth housemate , sitting alone at the dining room table . She was doing homework . She looked up from her book and shook her head , above the playfulness . The camera angled back to Yula . She said , " I ca n't speak for everyone else , but I know I gets mines . " Yula had no shame , and she liked to shock people , like at that moment . Bridget stopped the tone of the conversation . " No one asked you that , Yula . You do n't have to share that . I mean , keep some decency . " Ayanna said , " Girl , she can say she gets her man if she wants to . What 's wrong with that ? I know I get mine . " " Yeah , you hang out with enough of them , " Bridget responded . Ayanna frowned and said , " Bridget , do n't try to act like you do n't be gettin ' yours . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " Yula agreed with Ayanna . " I know . She 's trying to be all Goody Two-shoes up in here . " Finally , the fourth housemate spoke up from the dining room table . " Y'all all in here tellin ' y'all business . You do n't even know what she 's gon na do with this stuff . " " That 's what I 'm trying to say , " Bridget added . " It 's a documentary on the life of college students , right ? " Yula asked . Bridget said , " Yeah , but still ... " " A documentary for who ? " the fourth housemate questioned . The camera zoomed in on her dark brown face of symmetry . Her eyes , nose , lips , and chin were all defined in smooth arcs and were lined up perfectly . Her long , straight black hair was pulled back in a ponytail and held in place with a red scrunchie . Bridget said , " That 's Leslie Beaudet . She 's from New Orleans , and she tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leslie , say something for the camera . " The camera did n't budge from her while she sat calmly at the table . It zoomed in closer to her . Leslie 's face filled up the screen . The stillness of her eyes was just as perfect as everything else about her . They peered straight ahead with serious intent . Leslie asked them , " What do you want me to say ? " " Say anything , " Ayanna told her . " Tell us something extra about N'aw-lins . Talk about that voodoo shit down here . Speak in French , L. Do anything , girl . Anything ! " Everyone laughed but Leslie . There was no playfulness left in her . She was mature beyond her years , and the calm focus of her eyes on the camera told you everything ... and nothing . She turned from the camera and declined to speak , with a simple shake of her head and a hum , " Mmmpt mmm . " And that was it . " Come on , Leslie , just tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations in school and stuff , " Bridget complained in the background . The camera refused to move from Leslie . It loved her stillness , the shine of her long black hair , and the value of her sparse movements . Nothing was wasted with her . And not another word was spoken from her mouth . * Bridget apologized to her camera-holding friend when they walked outside together . " I 'm sorry about that , Kaiyah . I mean , Leslie knew what we were doing . She even agreed to be here for it . " The sunlight had faded by the time they had all told their individual stories . All except for Leslie , who continued to listen while doing her homework . Kaiyah asked , " Is she usually tight on conversation like that ? " She was a tall , medium-brown girl wearing a green-and-white sweatshirt from Tulane University . Bridget nodded . " I 'm afraid so . But sometimes she talks . I mean , we could n't have become friends without it , right ? " She forced herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She just needs to be comfortable in front of the camera , that 's all . " Kaiyah returned her nod . " Well , as long as she keeps it real with herself . You do n't want her to act outside of herself . Documentaries are supposed to capture people just how they are in everyday situations . So she did good by just being herself . " Bridget asked , " Well , do you think they 'll still decide to use us in the documentary ? " Kaiyah could n't promise her anything . Even the question bothered her . She liked the chocolate crew . They would have added the needed flavor to the documentary of college students that she and a handful of Tulane classmates were working on . However , Kaiyah also understood the racial politics of America . Blacks were often not included in popular American culture , and she did n't want to set Bridget and her housemates up for a letdown . Kaiyah took the safe road . She said , " Well , we 'll have to wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the same house , that would make it easier for us to stay in contact and film all of you . " " That 's what I 'm saying . We would be perfect for it , like MTV 's The Real World , right ? " Bridget joked . Kaiyah smiled , but she still made no promises . " I 'll see what happens and call you . " Bridget sighed . It was out of her hands . She would have to be patient and await the outcome . She refused to hide her disappointment from her friends when she reentered the house . " Oh well , now we have to just wait and see , " she told them in dejection . Bridget looked forward to her college life being documented . She wanted to stand out and be special . Yula looked at Ayanna , and Ayanna looked over at Leslie . Leslie looked up from her work again but did n't comment . No one wanted to blame her , but they all thought about it . They all wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it would have been best if Leslie had not been home and they had left her out . However , Bridget remained optimistic . Leslie would come around . Besides , they could n't come down on the New Orleans homegirl too hard if they still wanted to eat well . Leslie was the best cook in the house . She was the best cook that any of them had ever known , including their mothers and extended family members . Leslie could outright " throw down " with exotic meals . Cajun food . Creole food . Soul food . Haitian . You name it ! Ayanna broke the stale silence in the room and asked , " Well ... what 's for dinner tonight ... Leslie ? " The room was filled with laughter again . Even Leslie chuckled at it from the table . She said , " Do n't worry about it , I 'll hook it up like I always do . " " Yeah , and I do n't even need the names , " Ayanna joked . " I ca n't pronounce most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just hook that shit up , L. I still love you . " Leslie had a joke herself . " Seven dollars a plate , " she told them . Ayanna stopped and looked at Bridget . " You still giving her a discount on the rent for her cooking ? " Bridget looked embarrassed again . She looked at Leslie and shook her head in disgust . Yula said , " Wait a minute , I can cook too . What kind of discount do I get ? " Leslie said , " You can cook tonight then . " Ayanna frowned . " Oh no she ca n't . I 'm too hungry tonight for that experimentation shit . I 'll fuckin ' go to Popeyes ' for all of that . " Yula said , " Do n't even try it , Ayanna . My cooking is not that bad . " Leslie flashed an eye of reprimand at Bridget before she responded to Ayanna . " Popeye 's cook some of the same stuff that I cook anyway . Maybe you should eat there every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie was pissed about her big mouth . She said , " Leslie , do n't even get like that . I 'm not sweatin ' that rent thing . You deserve a break on the rent . I mean , you get most of the groceries . " " Well , why you bring it up then if you not sweatin ' it ? " Leslie asked her . Ayanna felt trapped and guilty . She looked for a way out . She said , " Well , Bridget told me about it . Maybe she got problems with it . " Bridget raised up her hands and closed her eyes . Ayanna 's mouth was unbelievable ! Bridget said , " Ayanna , you are just too damned petty ! " " Whatever , as long as I eat tonight . I pay my damn rent . Or my mother pays it , ' cause I ai n't got no money like that . " She looked at Bridget and said , " But your father does . I do n't know why you sweat any of us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us . " Bridget snapped , " Ayanna , you knew how hard college was going to be on you financially before you ever met me . So do n't even play that . That 's just plain foul . And you know it . " Ayanna chuckled and said , " You ca n't blame a girl for trying . " Yula continued to feel left out of the argument . " I can cook and buy groceries too , " she protested . " I need a damn break on the rent . " Leslie took a deep breath and let it all slide . She got back to her schoolwork. * Hot spices sprinkled into the simmering pot that Leslie stirred with a long wooden spoon that night . She stood in front of the stove inside the kitchen , wearing a full apron . She no longer needed to measure her ingredients . Her cooking had become a precise rhythm . Time and practice had made it perfect . As she cooked , she looked expectantly every few minutes or so at the white telephone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the phone before it would ring sometimes . Her ears could zone in on it before it made a sound . It would be another call from her family . They were always calling her . By age nineteen , in her sophomore year of college , she was used to it . Her family needed her . So she had learned to expect their calls while in the middle of anything . As she watched the phone , anticipating its ring , she noticed the abused telephone cord that had been stretched out of shape , dangling almost to the floor , twisted and deranged , and twirling without reason . Yet they still managed to use it . Leslie watched that phone cord bouncing up against the wall and wondered . What would her life be like if she had more control over it ? Or perhaps ... if she had control over others , so that she might unravel herself and break free from their grip . She wanted to fall to the ground and unshackle her feet from the past , so that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was younger . She wanted to be exempt of responsibility . But as she was , they still managed to use her  --  her loyal stability , her levelheaded dignity , and her high regard for duty  --  against herself , while they ignored her , the telephone cord stretched out of shape , dangling almost to the floor , twisted and deranged , and twirling without reason . Maybe she should have left and traveled far enough away from home to avoid the entanglement . If such a thing were even possible for a woman . Freedom from family and friends was sacrilege . A woman was the root of things , and Leslie felt every one of her roots . They were holding her down instead of allowing her a chance to grow and extend her branches toward heaven ... and toward the sunshine . But instead of receiving a phone call from her family , Bridget snuck into the kitchen to apologize to Leslie for her indiscretions . She placed her right hand on Leslie 's shoulder . " I 'm sorry about that , Lez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's all right . " Only it was n't . It was never all right . Leslie had always gotten the short end of the stick , and she had found a way to make do with it . But that did n't make it all right . Why did Bridget feel a need to express their private agreement to Ayanna in the first place ? " If you want me to pay the full rent , just tell me , " Leslie commented . She remained focused on her pot and the spoon that stirred it . Bridget apologized a second time in a lower tone . " Leslie , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean it like that . I do n't need you to pay the full rent . I mean ... I understand your situation . " Leslie asked her curiously , " What situation ? " She was unmoved by the apology and tired of its ritual . She did n't want anyone 's pity . She wanted respect for all that she had done and would continue to do . Bridget felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I ... I mean ... " " You mean what ? That I do n't have as much money as you do ? " Leslie asked her . Bridget did not understand her situation . It was about more than just money . It was about having peace of mind . Bridget had peace of mind . And her father 's income as a physician allowed her to be able to do things that Leslie could only dream about . " Well , I 'm starting over at zero , Leslie . It 's not like it 's my money , " Bridget reasoned . " I mean , I 'm using it right now to help all of us . And my father knows that . But I ca n't let it be like a free ride on me . We still have to work for it . Everybody has to work for it . That 's what we go to school for . " " And I 'm not working for it ? " Leslie asked her , spoon in hand in her apron at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times do I have to say that I 'm sorry ? " " Until you remember not to do that shit again , " Leslie told her . " Because you ca n't just buy my acceptance of an apology , you have to work for it . " Leslie turned away from her and went back to her cooking . Bridget only looked and shook her head . She still did n't know how to figure Leslie out , but she never stopped trying . She wanted to be there for Leslie as a true friend whenever she would need it . Leslie felt the stare on her back and added , " Dinner 'll be ready in ten minutes . " Bridget responded with a nod . " Okay . And thanks for everything . I really appreciate all that you do , Leslie . And I mean that . " Leslie met her friend 's eyes with hers and nodded back to her for a truce . However , when Bridget had left the kitchen , Leslie smiled to herself and thought about her words , " starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what " zero " means , Leslie thought to herself . Let me start at zero from her house . When they all sat down at the dining room table to eat , Leslie felt good about the absence of her usual phone calls . She did n't let on to it , though . She held that small semblance of peace to herself and kept busy to lessen her anxiety about it . How long would it last ? " L , why do n't you sit down and stop moving around so much ? " Ayanna complained . She noticed Leslie 's diligence around the table . She joked and said , " Let Y do some of that shit . She could use the exercise . " Bridget grimaced and shook her head from behind her plate at the table . Yula said , " Do n't pay her no mind , y'all . I do n't even think about that girl . Because if she really bothered me , I would just toss her tomboy ass on the floor and just sit on her . " Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the same time , she thought to herself , Why is she even here with us ? Ayanna responded to Bridget 's statement and thoughts on her . " I mean , I love y'all and everything , I 'm just keepin ' it real . And I 'm that nigga to say what needs to be said , " she responded with candor . Yula looked around the room and raised up her hands . " Well , there you go . That 's why I do n't pay her no mind . She 's that nigga , and niggas will say anything out their mouth . " Bridget said , " But I thought that we were here in college to learn how not to be niggas , and bitches , and hoes , and all that other negative shit . " Ayanna 's eyes popped open at the table from behind her own devoured plate of food . She said , " Did you hear that shit , L ? B just said ' niggas , ' ' bitches , ' ' hoes , ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh my God ! I must be having a bad influence on this girl . " She continued joking and said , " Bridget , do n't be like me . Okay ? Be better than me . Be yourself . Okay ? Because I do n't want your father to disown you . That would fuck it up for all of us . I like this house . I really do . " The room filled with laughter again . Ayanna added , " To be honest about it , though , B , you never was a nigga , you just a brown American . But you came to N'awlins to be around niggas , so do n't even front . That 's why you like me . I know you like me . ' Cause I 'm raw like that with no seasoning . But see , Y and L know what being a nigga is all about . They know what I 'm talking about . We know . " Leslie said , " Do n't put me in that . " Yula agreed with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badge of honor or something , and it ai n't . I came to college to get away from that nigga shit just like Bridget said . " " Well , how come y'all all did n't go to a white school then , since y'all want to get away from ' nigga shit ' so much ? " Ayanna asked them . When the response did n't come quickly enough , Ayanna concluded , " That 's what I thought . Everybody 's in here frontin ' but me . I 'm the only one keepin ' it real . " Yula smiled and said , " I wanted to feel comfortable around other educated black people , but not niggas . " Leslie answered , " Those white schools cost too much anyway , unless you 're on a full scholarship . " Leslie was on a partial academic scholarship at Dillard , with off-campus employment and student loans . Ayanna and Yula were attending school on straight tuition , student loans , and work-study programs . And Bridget ... was another story . " So what 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ayanna told her . She knew that it was n't a money thing with a doctor 's daughter . Bridget answered , " Like Yula said , to be around other educated black people . " " You could have gone to Xavier for that . You could have been down like Brandy over there at Xavier with your little Creole friend , Eugene . Why you choose Dillard ? " Ayanna pressed her . Bridget snapped , " Does it matter ? Would you be better off if you never met me ? " Ayanna thought about it and came out grinning . " Nah , girl , you my dog . I 'm glad you came here , " she responded with a chuckle . Bridget said , " And I 'm not your dog , Ayanna , I 'm your girl . That sounds a lot better to me . Stop talking like these rapper guys so much . And stop sweating Eugene , too , " she added . " You act like you 're jealous . " Ayanna denied it . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie smiled at it . Ayanna was lying . She was jealous of Eugene . Secretly , Leslie figured that Ayanna wanted her own light-skinned , wavy-haired friend . Ayanna wanted more than what she felt she deserved , and she envied Bridget for going for it . Leslie even wondered if her Houston friend would fall for her older brother , Pierre . He did n't have the light skin but he had the dark wavy hair . A head full of it . Yula looked at Bridget and frowned at her choice of words . She joked , " You 're her girl , Bridget ? " Ayanna caught on to it and started laughing . " Oh , I do n't get down like that . I got ta have the wood after the tongue . The real wood . " Leslie laughed and shook her head . Ayanna was a trifling fool ! But she was harmless , as long as you never took her too seriously . However , the self-assured remarks from Bridget kept Leslie on her guard , joke or no joke . Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her wealth . Leslie envied that security . She had toiled every single day of her life to earn any and every thing that she had , and it was never secure . Yula coveted Bridget 's slim , trim waistline , although she would never admit it . Yula had learned to live with what size she was given . So they all envied Bridget . Bridget could afford to be confident and optimistic . She was rich beyond income . She was rich in mind , body , and in spirit , the most important wealth . " Anyway , " Bridget told them , " I 'm glad that we 're all here with nowhere to go tonight , because I always wanted to play this thing with you guys . " She stood and rushed over to the coat closet . She pulled out a white bag from the bottom and hurried back to the dining room table , tugging out a brand-new Ouija board . Yula took one look at it and said , " I know that ai n't what I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , it 's a wee-gee board , " she confirmed . Ayanna grinned and said , " Every time I see that word , I think , How come it 's not pronounced ou-jah board , or just spelled differently ? " Leslie smiled and said , " O-u-i is pronounced we in French and it means ' yes . ' And ja or gee , spelled j-e-u , means , like , a game . So it basically means a yes game , or an answer board . " She began to clear their plates from the table and added , " It 's like witchcraft , where you call out the spirits for answers . " " Is it anything like voodoo ? " Ayanna asked . Yula looked back and forth at them with large eyes . Leslie continued to smile while shaking her head . " I do n't know why you keep asking me about voodoo . I do n't know much about that . You probably know more than I do , as much as you like to talk about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all , " Ayanna explained . " And with you being from New Orleans and knowing French and Creole and everything , I just figured that you would know . " Leslie shook her head . " Well , I do n't . " She had often asked her father about voodoo as a child , out of her own curiosity . And her father would never talk about it . But she had never asked her mother . Bridget asked them all , " So is everyone willing to play it ? " It was slightly after eight o'clock . Leslie nodded her head and grabbed the last of the food to put away . " I 'm willing , " she said , moving swiftly to the kitchen . Ayanna said , " Yeah , count me in , girl . " But Yula was uninterested , and that was an understatement . She said , " Aw , hell naw ! I 'm not playing that shit . Hell no ! " she hollered . Bridget opened up the box over the dining room table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . " Yula shut her eyes and refused to even look at the game . Ayanna said , " Oh shit ! You got a glow-in-the-dark one ? " Bridget said , " I figured it would be more fun to play it in the dark . " Yula started to get up and walk off , with her eyes still closed . In the kitchen , Leslie shoved the leftover food into the refrigerator and tossed the dirty plates into soapy water in the sink to wash later . She began to pray that the phone did n't ring . She even thought of ignoring it if it did . She had some serious questions to ask the spirit world . She had never come face-to-face with an actual Ouija board before . She had only heard and read about it , along with palm readings , numerology , tarot cards , and everything else that was deemed mystical , including the often talked about voodoo . Ayanna tried to keep Yula from leaving the room as Bridget read the instructions . " Come on , Yula , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That shit ai n't real , " Ayanna insisted while yanking Yula 's arm . Leslie sat and helped Bridget with the instructions while picking up the message indicator , a raised , triangular-shaped pointer with an open eye at the center . The Ouija board sat out under the dining room light to effect a strong glow while in the dark . It was labeled with the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet in a downward arc , with the ten basic counting numbers from one to nine and then zero below . Above the alphabet , and in opposite corners of the board , were the answers YES and NO . And at the very bottom was the written message GOOD-BYE . " So , this is supposed to point to something as we hold on to it ? " Leslie asked Bridget , referring to the message indicator . Bridget answered , " Yeah . But it looks more complicated than I thought . How are we supposed to actually spell stuff with it ? That seems like it 'll take a lot of time . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I guess we start with simple words first , " Leslie suggested . She smiled and said , " Maybe we 'll ask it what kind of grades Ayanna will get this semester . " Ayanna yelled , " I heard that , " while still struggling with Yula . " Come on , y'all , help me to get Yula back to the table . She 's acting all paranoid and shit . " Yula said , " Girl , I 'm not messin ' with that witchcraft stuff . I know I did n't come to college for that . So y'all can just leave me the hell out of it ! " Leslie told Ayanna , " Let her go , then . We 'll just ask it whether or not she 'll be able to sleep tonight without having nightmares . " Everyone laughed but Yula . Yula froze in her stance , immobilized . Then , with a desperate heave , she freed herself from Ayanna 's grip and flung her to the floor . The panic of fear had strengthened her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie . It 's not . I do n't play with that kind of stuff . Y'all just need to leave that damn thing alone . I 'm serious , y'all . Put that thing away . " Bridget smiled at her overzealous friend and paid her no mind . She was eager for a new experience , and Yula was acting childish about it . Yula reminded Bridget of far too many Southern stereotypes and slave films , where black actors and actresses responded to everything that moved . Their eyes would widen comically while they ran about in circles , hands raised to the sky , wearing ragged servants ' dresses and farmers ' overalls . And those embarrassing images of America 's past perceptions of the " Negro " made Bridget more determined to ignore Yula 's misguided fears . But how could she explain it to her friend without offending her ? As Bridget thought it over , Leslie glared at Yula from the table and asked her , " Why ? What is this Ouija board gon na do to us that people ca n't ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer . " I do n't know , I just do n't want to fool with that thing , " Yula answered . Ayanna looked back to Leslie . Leslie seemed excited while in a game of willpower . " Well , go to bed , then , " she told Yula . " You wan na be afraid of things just because you 've never experienced them before ? Go to bed . " They waited again for Yula 's response . " There 's gon na be a lot of things that you 've never experienced before , Yula , " Leslie told her . " You need to get over that shit . Just face it head-on . Be a woman about it . This here ai n't nothing but a game . And we 're all friends in here . " Leslie pointed with her right finger toward the front door . " But that shit out there , " she continued , " is real . So what are you gon na run from out there ? Or who are you gon na run from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . " That 's different , Leslie . " " How so ? " " I mean ... like you said , that 's real life . But I do n't have to play with no game if I do n't want to . " " Well , just say that , then , instead of acting all scary , " Ayanna jumped in on her . They all waited there for Yula . Would she step up and face her fears , or would she back down and crawl away to safety ? Yula took another look at Leslie and decided to defy her . She was n't going to bed like some kid afraid of a damn game board . She was bigger than that . And she would prove it to them . Yula flicked her head in defiance and said , " I 'll play the damn game , then , " and strutted back over to the dining room table to join them . Leslie grinned , slyly .

Yula composed herself , taking several deep breaths .
