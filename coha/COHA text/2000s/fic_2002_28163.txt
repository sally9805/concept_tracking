Garfield Potter sat low behind the wheel of an idling Caprice , his thumb stroking the rubber grip of the Colt revolver loosely fitted between his legs . On the bench beside him , leaning against the passenger window , sat Carlton Little . Little filled an empty White Owl wrapper with marijuana and tamped the herb with his thumb . Potter and Little were waiting on Charles White , who was in the backyard of his grandmother 's place , getting his dog out of a cage . " It do n't look like much , does it ? " said Potter , looking down at his own lap . Little grinned lazily . " That 's what the girls must say when you pull that thing out . " " Like Brianna , you mean ? Your girl ? She ai n't had no chance to look at it , ' cause I was waxin ' her from behind . She felt it , though . Made her forget all about you , too . I mean , when I was done hittin ' it she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't remember hers either , drunk as she had to be to fuck a sad motherfucker like you . " Little laughed some as he struck a match and held it to the end of the cigar . " I 'm talkin ' about this gun , fool . " Potter held up the Colt so Little , firing up the blunt , could see it . " Yeah , okay . Where 'd you get it at , man ? " " Traded it to this boy for half an OZ . Was one of those project guns , had n't even been fired but once or twice . Short barrel , only two inches long , you 'd think it could n't do shit . But this here is a three fifty-seven . They call it a carry revolver , ' cause you can carry this shit without no one knowin ' you strapped . I do n't need no long barrel , anyway . I like to work close in . " " I 'll stick with my nine . You do n't even know if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't be askin ' me for mines . " Potter was tall , light skinned , flat of stomach and chest , with thin , ropy forearms and biceps . He kept his hair shaved close to the scalp , with a small slash mark by way of a part . His irises were dark brown and filled his eyes ; his nose was a white boy 's nose , thin and aquiline . He was quick to smile . It was a smile that could be engaging when he wanted it to be , but more often than not it inspired fear . Little was not so tall . He was bulked in the shoulders and arms , but twiggish in the legs . A set of weights had given him the show muscles upstairs , but his legs , which he never worked on , betrayed the skinny , malnourished boy he used to be . He wore his hair braided in cornrows and kept a careless , weedy thatch of hair on his chin . Both wore carpenter jeans and button-down , short-sleeve plaid Nautica shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest in the window of the Foot Locker up at City Place ; he had a pair of blue-and-black Air Maxes on now . On Little 's feet were wheat-colored Timberland work boots , loosely laced and untied . Little held a long draw in his lungs and looked ahead , exhaling a cloud of smoke that crashed at the windshield . " Here comes Coon . Lookit how he 's all chest out and shit . Proud about that dog . " Charles White was walking his pit bull , Trooper , past a dying oak tree , its leaves nearly stripped bare . A tire hung on a chain from one of the branches . When he was a puppy , Trooper had swung on the tire for hours , holding it fast , strengthening his jaws . " That ai n't no game dog , " said Potter . " Coon ai n't no dog man , neither . " White had Trooper , brown with a white mask and golden-pink eyes , on a short leash attached to a heavy-ringed , wide leather collar . Trooper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average size and dressed similarly to his friends , moved toward the car , opened the back door , and let the dog in before getting inside himself . " S'up , fellas , " said White . " Coon , " said Little , looking over the bench at his friend . Others thought White 's street name had something to do with his color , dark as he was . But Little knew where the name had come from . He 'd been knowing Coon since they were both kids in the Section Eights , back in the early nineties , when White used to wear a coonskin hat , trying to look like that fool rapper from Digital Underground , that group that was popular then . There was the other thing , too : White had a nose on him , big and long like some cartoon animal . And he walked kind of pitched forward , with his bony fingers spread kind of like claws , the way a critter in the woods would do . " Gim me some of that hydro , Dirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his fondness for discussing women 's privates . Men 's , too . Also , he loved to eat all that greasy fast food . Little passed the blunt back to White . White hit it deep . " Your champion ready ? " said Potter . " What ? " said White . It was hard to hear in the car . Potter had the music , the new DMX joint on PGC , turned up loud . " I said , is that dumb animal gon na win us some money today ? " said Potter , raising his voice . White did n't answer right away . He held the smoke down in his lungs and let it out slow . " He gon na win us mad money , D , " said White . He reached over and massaged the dense muscles bunched around Trooper 's jaw . Trooper 's mouth opened in pleasure and his eyes shifted over to his master 's . " Right , boy ? " " Sure he 's strong enough ? " " Shoot , he was strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " " I ai n't ask you can he do circus tricks . Can he hold his shit in a fight ? " " He will . " " Well , he ai n't showed me nothin ' yet . " " What about that snatch we did with that boy 's dog over on Crittenden ? " Potter looked in the rearview at White . " That dog at Crittenden was n't nothin ' but a cur . Trooper a cur , too . " " The hell he is . You 're gon na see today . " " We better see . ' Cause I ai n't wastin ' my time or my green paper on no pussyass animal . " Potter slid the Colt under the waistband of his jeans . " I said , you 're gon na see . " " C'm on , D , " said Little . " Let 's get a roll on , man . " Garfield Potter 's street name was Death . He did n't care for it much since this girl he wanted to fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that girl 's drawers down , either . So he felt the name was bad luck , worse still to go and change it . His friends now called him D. Potter turned the key in the ignition . It made an awful grinding sound . Little clapped his hands together and doubled over with laughter . " Ho , shit ! " said Little , clapping his hands one more time . " Car 's already started , man , you do n't need to be startin ' it again ! Maybe if you turned that music down some you 'd know . " " Noisy as this whip is , too , " said White . " Fuck you , Coon , " said Potter , " talkin ' mad shit about this car , when you 're cruisin ' around town in that piece-of-shit Toyota , lookin ' like a Spanish Cadillac and shit . " " All this money we got , " said Little , " and we 're drivin ' around in a hooptie . " " We 'll be gettin ' rid of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ai n't all that funny as y'all are makin ' it out to be . " " Yeah , you right . It just hit me funny , is all . " Little took the blunt that White handed to him over the front seat and stared at it stupidly . " I ai n't lyin ' , boy , this chronic right here just laid my ass out . " The dogfights were held in a large garage backing to an alley behind a house on Ogelthorpe , in Manor Park in Northwest . The fights went down once a week for several hours during the day , when most of the neighbors were off at work . Those neighbors who were at home were afraid of the young men who came to the fights , and did not complain to the police . Potter parked the Chevy in the alley . He and the others got out of the car , White heeling Trooper to his side . They went down the alley , nodding but not smiling at some young men they knew to be members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their animals , getting high , and drinking from the lips of bottles peeking through the tops of brown paper bags . Little and Wright followed Potter into the garage . Ten to twenty young men were scattered about the perimeter of the garage . A group was shooting craps in the corner . Others were passing around joints . Someone had put on Dr. Dre 2001 , with Snoop , Eminem , and all them , and it was coming loud from a box . In the middle of the garage was a fighting area of industrial carpet , penned off from the rest of the interior by a low chain-link fence , gated in two corners . Inside one corner of the pen , a man held a link leash taut on a black pit bull spotted brown over its belly and chest . The dog 's name was Diesel . Its ears were gnarled and its neck showed raised scars like pink worms . Potter studied a man , old for this group , maybe thirty or so , who stood alone in a corner , putting fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few , " said Potter to Little . " ' Bout ready to show the dogs , " said Little . " Got a mind to put money on that black dog . But go ahead and bet Trooper , hear ? " " Three hunrid ? " " Three 's good . " Potter made his way over to the cigarette smoker , short and dumpy , a raggedy-ass dude on the way down , and stood before him . " I know you . " The smoker looked up with lazy eyes , trying to hold on to his shit . " Yeah ? " " You run with Lorenze Wilder , right ? " " I seen him around . Do n't mean we run together or nothin ' like that . " But now the smoker recognized Potter and he lost his will to keep his pride . His eyes dropped to the concrete floor . " Outside , " said Potter . The older man followed Potter into the daylight , not too fast but without protest . Potter led him around the garage 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . " What 's your name ? " " Edward Diggs . " " Call you Digger Dog , right ? " " Some do . " " Lorenze called you that when we sold him that hydro a few weeks back . You were standing right next to him . Remember me now ? " Diggs said nothing , and Potter moved forward so that he was looking down on Diggs and just a few inches from his face . Diggs 's back touched the garage wall . " So where your boy Lorenze at ? " " I do n't know . He stays in his mother 's old house " " Over off North Dakota . I know where that is , and he ai n't been there awhile . Leastways , I ai n't caught him in . He got a woman he cribs with on the side ? " Diggs avoided Potter 's stare . " Not that I know . " " What about other kin ? " Diggs took a long final drag off his cigarette and dropped it to the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , out in the alley , but there was no one there . Everyone had gone inside the garage . Potter spread one tail on his shirt and draped it back behind the butt of the Colt , so that Diggs could see . Diggs shifted his eyes again and lowered his voice . He had to give this boy something , just so he 'd go away . " Lorenze got a sister . She be livin ' down in Park Morton with her little boy . " " Maybe I 'll drop by . What 's her name ? " " I would n't . . . What I 'm sayin ' is , you want my advice " Potter open-handed Diggs across the face . He used his left hand to bunch Diggs 's shirt at the collar , then yanked Diggs forward and slapped him again . Diggs said nothing , his body limp . Potter held him fast . " What 's the sister 's name ? " Diggs 's eyes had teared up . He hated himself for that . All he meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fuck with Lorenze 's sister or her kid . But it was too late for all that now . " I do n't know her name , " said Diggs . " And anyway , Lorenze , he do n't never go by the way or nothin ' . He do n't talk to his sister much , way I understand it . Sometimes he watches her kid play football ; boy 's on this tackle team . But that 's as close as he gets to her . " " Where the kid play at ? " " Lorenze said the kid practices in the evenings at some high school . " " Which school ? " " He live in Park Morton , so it must be Roosevelt . It ai n't but a few blocks up the street there " " I ai n't asked you for directions , did I ? I live up on Warder Street my own self , so you do n't need to be drawin ' me a map . " " It ai n't too far from there , is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smiled and released his grip on Diggs . " I did n't hurt you none , did I ? ' Cause , look , I did n't mean nothin ' , hear ? " Diggs straightened his collar . " I 'm all right . " " Let me get one of those cigarettes from you , black . " Diggs reached into his breast pocket and retrieved his pack of Kools . A cigarette slid out into his palm . He handed the cigarette to Potter . Potter snapped the cigarette in half and bounced the halves off Diggs 's chest . Potter 's laugh was like a bark . He turned and walked away . Diggs straightened his shirt and stepped quickly down the alley . He looked over his shoulder and saw that Potter had turned the corner . Diggs reached into his pocket and shook another cigarette out from a hole he had torn in the bottom of the pack . Diggs 's boy Lorenze was staying with this girl he knew over in Northeast . Lorenze had kind of laughed it off , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . But he was proud he had n't given Lorenze up . Most folks he knew did n't credit him for being so strong . Diggs struck a match . He noticed that his hand was shaking some as he fired up his cigarette . Back in the garage , Potter sidled up next to Little . The owner of the garage , also the house bookie , stood nearby , holding the cash and taking late bets . In one corner of the pen , Charles White finished sponging Trooper down with warm , soapy water . Diesel 's owner , in the opposite corner , did the same . Many dogs were treated with chemicals that could disorient the opponent . The rule in this arena was that both dogs had to be washed prior to a fight . White scratched the top of Trooper 's head , bent in , and uttered random words into his ear with a soothing tone . The referee , an obese young man , stepped into the ring after a nod from the owner of the garage . " Both corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pit . " White moved behind his dog into the space of the open gate , still holding Trooper back . " Face your dogs , " said the referee . They did this , and quickly the referee said , " Let go ! " The dogs shot into the center of the pit . Both of them got up on their hind legs , attacking the head of the other with their jaws . They snapped at each other 's ears and sought purchase in the area of the neck . In the fury of their battle , the dogs did not make a sound . The garage echoed with the shouts and laughter of the spectators crowding the ring . For a moment the dogs seemed to reach a stalemate . Suddenly their motions accelerated . Their bodies meshed in a blur of brown and black , and the bright pink of exposed gums . Droplets of blood arced up in the center of the ring . Diesel got a neck-hold and Trooper was taken down . Trooper , adrenalized , his eyes bright and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ears had been partially torn away , and blood had leaked onto the dog 's white mask . Diesel went in , back to the neck . And now Trooper was down again , in the jaws of Diesel , squirming beneath the black dog . " Stop it ! " shouted White . Potter nudged Little , who nodded by way of reply . " That 's it , " said the referee , waving his arms . White went into the ring and grabbed Trooper 's hind legs , pulling back . Diesel 's owner did the same . Diesel relaxed his jaws , releasing Trooper to his man . The spectators moved away from the pen , laughing , giving one another skin , already trying out stories on one another that exaggerated the details of the fight . " You were right , " said Little . " That dog was a cur . " " What I tell you ? " said Potter . " Dog 's personality only as strong as the man who owns it . " White arrived with Trooper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up some , " said White , not looking into his friends ' eyes . " We 'll do it now , " said Potter . " Let 's go . " A couple of blocks away , near Fort Slocum Park , Potter pulled the Chevy into an alley where there seemed to be no activity . He cut the engine and looked over the backseat at White ; Trooper sat panting , his hip resting against his owner 's . " Dog needs to pee , " said Potter . " He went , " said White . " Let 's just take him to the vet place . " " He already bleedin ' all over the backseat . He pees back there , too , I ai n't gon na be too happy . Gim me the leash , man , I 'll walk him . " " I 'll walk him , " said White . His lip quivered when he spoke . " Let D walk him if he wants to , Coon , " said Little . " Dog needs to pee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leash . " Potter got out of the car and went around to White 's side . He opened the door and took hold of the leash . The dog looked over at White and then jumped his lap and was out of the car . Potter walked Trooper down the alley until they were behind a high wooden privacy fence . Potter looked around briefly , saw no one in the neighboring yards or in the windows of the houses , and commanded the dog to sit . When Trooper sat , Potter pulled the .357 Colt from his waistband , pointed it close to the dog 's right eye , and squeezed the trigger . Trooper 's muzzle and most of his face exploded out into the alley in a haze of bone and blood . The dog toppled over onto its side and its legs straightened in a shudder . Potter stepped back and shot the dog in the ribcage one more time . Trooper 's carcass lifted an inch or two off the ground and came to rest . Potter went back to the car and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half of the White Owl blunt he had not yet smoked . " Gun works , " said Potter . Little nodded . " Loud , too . " Potter put the trans in gear , draped his arm over the bench seat , and turned his head to look out the rear window as he reversed the car out of the alley . White was staring out the window , his face dirty from tears he had tried to wipe away . " Go on and get it out you , " said Potter . " Someone you know see you cryin ' over some dumb animal , they gon na mistake you for a bitch . And I ai n't ridin ' with none of that . " Potter&gt; , Little , and White bought a kilo of marijuana from their dealer in Columbia Heights , dimed out half of it back at their place , and delivered the dimes to their runners so they could get started on the evening rush . Then the three of them drove north up Georgia Avenue and over to Roosevelt High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parked the Chevy beside a black Cadillac Brougham . There were several other cars in the lot . Potter looked in the rearview at White , staring ahead . " We straight , Coon ? " " Just a dumb animal , like you said . Do n't mean nothin ' to me . " Potter did n't like the tone in White 's voice . But White was just showing a little pride . That was good , but he 'd never act on his anger for real . Like his weak-ass dog , he was n't game . " I 'll check it out , " said Potter to Little . He walked across the parking lot and stood at the fence that bordered the stadium down below . After a while he came back to the car . " You see him ? " said Little as Potter got back behind the wheel . " Nah , " said Potter . " Just some kids playin ' football . Some old-time motherfuckers , coaches and shit . " " We can come back . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see him , too . " " Wilder do n't owe you but a hundred dollars , D. " " Thinks he can ignore his debt . Tryin ' to take me for bad ; you know I ca n't just let that go . " " Ai n't like you need the money today or nothin ' like that . " " It ai n't the money , " said Potter . " And I can wait . "
