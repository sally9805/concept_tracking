<p> It 's not clear who will be first , but one thing is certain . Three women in the Sakhi family are due to give birth in the next month , and Nasima Kuchi , a midwife , wants to make sure they know what to do - and what not to do . <p> The birthing bed should be covered with a clean towel and plastic , she explains to a rapt audience of women in the family 's front room , usually reserved for male visitors . <p> To Westerners , the need for sanitary conditions at a birth may be obvious . But not necessarily in Afghanistan . In one old tradition , women would spread a layer of earth in the place where the woman was to give birth as a way to protect the house . <p> Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Afghanistan has the second-highest maternal mortality rate in the world . Only Sierra Leone 's is higher . <p> Of every 100,000 women who go into labor in Afghanistan , about 1,900 die , according to Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations Children 's Fund . In the US and Japan , by comparison , the number is 8 in every 100,000 women . Afghanistan 's infant mortality rate , at 165 per 1,000 live births , is also among the world 's highest . <p> But Mrs. Kuchi is trying to change those grim statistics . She and others are part of a new breed of midwives who go house to house , teaching Afghan women about sanitation , childbirth , and infant care . A Swedish charity pays for the cost of the midwives ' training and services . <p> Still , Kuchi and her handful of colleagues know they have their work cut out for them . Although midwives have been around for many years , few have had much training . The vast majority of Afghan women give birth at home , helped along by other family members following customs passed down from generation to generation . Much of their information entails more myth than methodology . <p> Replacing old ways with new <p> Thus Kuchi spends a great deal of time explaining the basics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the baby is born , do n't put lipstick on its navel , where the umbilical cord has just been cut . <p> " Some people put lipstick on the navel because they think that it will help the baby 's lips turn red , " says Kuchi , a fair-skinned woman with a patrician air and elegantly applied makeup . <p> " Do n't put anything on the navel , " she advises the women . Another important point : If the mother must give birth by Caesarean section , do not follow the conventional wisdom , which holds that she should not be fed for three days afterward . <p> Although it may sound like common sense , much of Kuchi 's information is a revelation to these women . <p> Many still follow the popular practice that a woman should not eat when she is getting close to her due date - and subsequently gets weaker when she needs her strength . <p> Others believe that a newborn baby should be kept from the mother for at least a day , and should not be fed anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its life . <p> Nearly half of Afghan women of childbearing age who die each year do so as a result of complications in pregnancy or childbirth . A motherless newborn has only a 1 in 4 four chance of survival . Only 7 percent of women who die during or after labor gave birth with the help of a skilled attendant , according to a joint study last year by UNICEF and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta . <p> Most of the deaths , the study found , were preventable . <p> The numbers add up to this : Motherhood , society 's most important job for more than half of the population of Afghanistan , is also its most perilous . <p> Two years after the fall of the Taliban , which ordered women to stay home - and made it almost impossible for Kuchi to get out to do her work - improving training for midwives is considered by international health advocates to be part of Afghanistan 's reconstruction plan . <p> Heathcare often inaccessible <p> But many problems remain . Poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to healthcare , including the services of midwives . The result of more than two decades of war and a fundamentalist regime mean many families still forbid women to see a male care provider - making the role of midwives like Kuchi all the more crucial . <p> This morning , on a typical day in the life of an Afghan midwife , Kuchi is visiting Kabul 's poorest neighborhoods . With her is a list of houses where pregnant women live . When she comes into the Sakhi home , they behave as if a great dignitary has arrived , and then a crowd gathers around to watch her go to work . <p> Kuchi , who has six children of her own , asks the three women who are due next month to approach her . Each is a wife of one of the family 's eight sons ; a new wife usually moves in with her husband 's family . Kuchi moves her hands over each rounded belly , listening with a rudimentary stethoscope for a baby 's heartbeat . <p> Then Kuchi and her midwife partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver a baby . <p> Assembled on the carpet are all the women of the extended family , as well as girls from the age of 10 , some of whom can expect to be mothers in the next four to five years . <p> Most of the women will bear their children here , in this cement room where a chilly draft wafts through windows that sit askew . <p> Hajira is on her sixth birth , although she 's already lost two infants along the way . A baby-faced woman in a dark-blue scarf , she looks too young to have been through so much . But at 20 , she 's already been married for six years , and had one pregnancy a year . <p> " We did n't know what to do , really , " says Hajira . " Now we know more , because the midwives come to visit and they keep coming back . <p> " She 's always reminding us what to do , " the young woman says of Kuchi , " because it 's good to hear it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the midwives hand out sealed bags , free kits from the United Nations that come with the bare essentials - a clean sheet and plastic , plus a string and a razor for cutting the umbilical cord . <p> Using a doll - which looks more like a gingerbread man with a tube coming from its stomach - Kuchi demonstrates how to treat the newborn . She carefully shows the women how to make two knots in the umbilical cord , a distance apart , and then cut in between . <p> While the procedure looks simple enough , thousands of Afghan infants die each year of tetanus acquired from cutting the cord . <p> If pregnant women do n't have one of these ready-made kits , Kuchi says , they need to make one . Boil the string . Wash the cloth and plastic and hang them out to dry . No one who has n't just washed her hands should be allowed to touch it . In a pop quiz , Kuchi asks a few women to reenact what they just learned . <p> " If the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , " Kuchi tells them . When in doubt , she says , send for her . <p> Many families , however , will not - or wo n't have the option . Some are afraid of having to pay costs they assume are associated with employing a midwife . Kuchi and Musleh , however , do not take any fees . Their visits are paid for by Terre des Hommes , a Swedish aid organization . <p> " Most of our patients want to have the child at home , " says Kuchi . " This way , they can rest there and they do n't have to travel and pay for the transportation . " <p> In more remote , rural areas of Afghanistan , where the mortality rate is the highest , there are very few trained midwives , and the lack of transportation makes getting help almost impossible ; some villages are accessible only by donkey . <p> Moreover , many families are unable to recognize an emergency when it occurs . Training by the midwives gives them a better sense of when to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of Kuchi 's visit , the women have more questions . One wants to know why she ca n't conceive - and many others want to know how they can stop . <p> Birth control , says one of the wives , Mektup , a mother of seven , is a controversial issue : " In Islam , they say it is a sin to take birth control pills , but what should I do ? I already have seven children . I pray to God that all my children live , but I do n't want any more . All of our husbands are poor , and we can not afford to have more children . " <p> Kuchi does n't answer . She bids farewell and heads off to another Kabul home at the end of a rocky , dirt road . Here , a woman named Nuriya gave birth to Suriya , now 6 weeks old , and Kuchi is visiting them for the first time since the delivery . <p> Wrapped up and sitting in Nuriya 's lap , Suriya has eyes that jump out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upper and lower lids are rimmed with black kohl , which the family believes will protect her from harm . <p> " We put the ' black stone ' on her eyes so she looks beautiful - so her eyes will be healthy and her eyesight will be good , " says Nuriya , a young mother of three whose husband is unemployed . " We put black on her eyes now so she 'll be able to see at night when she gets older . " <p> Nuriya 's mother , Nafes Gul , nods approvingly . <p> Now that she knows Suriya is doing well , Kuchi gives Nuriya tips on what to feed the baby . This is , after all , a country with no equivalent of books like " What to Expect in the First Year , " and no Baby Gerber jars on the shelves . <p> After six months , she says , you can feed the baby spinach , but do n't add oil or salt . Protein is n't a bad idea , either . <p> " Before , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egg to a baby because then the child would be stupid . " <p> The proud grandmother , Nafes Gul , is glad for the help . She had six boys and two daughters , but also lost four other children in childbirth . When she had her babies , there were no professional midwives ; other women in the family simply pitched in to help . She already has 16 grandchildren , she says . <p> " No , let 's count them , " says Nuriya , ticking off her siblings ' children . " Eighteen . " <p> " Yes , 18 , " Nafes Gul confirms with a laugh . And then she thanks Kuchi with a blessing : " May you live long . " <p> Kuchi 's final stop of the day is at a far poorer home , an adobe-style hut of packed mud . Inside , a young woman is pregnant for the first time - and nervous . <p> " How old are you ? " Kuchi asks . <p> " Hmm . Maybe 20 ? " comes the answer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatima . " <p> Kuchi takes out one of the information cards she uses to keep track of her patients . She leaves a copy behind , trying to encourage women to chart their own progress , insisting they keep it with them like an identity card . <p> Fatima is from the Hazara ethnic group , and her face is an exotic mix of East and West - Asian features with fair skin and freckles . Next to Kuchi 's urban clothing , Fatima 's tribal garb is bright and colorful . But her mood is not - she is n't feeling well , and is worried she will have a difficult pregnancy . <p> Her mother-in-law , who sits next to her spinning wool , considers her daughter-in-law to be getting a late start . <p> Kuchi gives Fatima advice on what to eat - less meat and more vegetables , of which there are few in the Afghan diet . Then she tells her to get more rest and do less heavy work , glancing at Fatima 's husband sitting in the corner . <p> As she leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails jutting out of the mud wall . Outside in the sunlight , Kuchi says she 's glad she no longer has to dress in the all-encompassing women 's wear that made Afghanistan famous . <p> " Without it , I feel young again , " she says with a smile . " And every time I wore it , I had a headache - it sits so tight around your head . " <p> The fact that most of her patients still wear burqas reminds her of how much Afghanistan has changed since she was young . <p> In the early 1970s , during Afghanistan 's modernizing heyday , women were wearing short skirts . In those days , she wanted to be a flight attendant on Afghanistan 's national airline - or a policewoman . Her father insisted she learn to be a midwife instead . <p> " I resented him then , but now I love it , " she says , closing up her kit for the day . Plumes of powdery dust from the alleyway kick up under her heels and swirl around the midwives ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her colleague will visit more houses . They will go to several more the next day , and the day after that . <p> But even with their many rounds , they know they will reach just a small percentage of Kabul 's expectant mothers . <p> Still , this is a big improvement over what life used to be . Under the Taliban , nearly all aid workers came under the suspicion of Afghanistan 's leaders , which made it more difficult to address the crisis in maternal fatality rates . <p> Now , in a freer postwar era , the United Nations and independent aid groups have been able to invest more in training programs for midwives . But their efforts are like a few scattered raindrops on badly parched soil . Many rural provinces still have no medical/health facilities at all - and are not being served by the new programs . <p> The largest training course is at Kabul 's Malalai Women 's Hospital , which offers five weeks of classes for midwives . <p> Many of the students there are women who had already been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " If someone becomes known as a midwife , everyone in the village trusts her and looks up to her , " says Ziba Kamal , chief of obstetrics at the hospital , during a break in her course for midwives , some of whom have traveled several hours to come to the course . <p> " Usually she has watched a few others , one or two , and then she becomes a midwife . " <p> It 's difficult to know how much of an impact the additional trained midwives are having in reversing the grim statistics surrounding birth in Afghanistan . <p> But Dr. Kamal and midwives such as Kuchi and Musleh are doing all they can to turn things around . <p> As Kuchi knows from experience , mothers who have had the help of a midwife are tremendously grateful - and relieved . <p> The presence of a calm , knowledgeable midwife does more than alleviate fear . It can be the difference between celebration and grief . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
