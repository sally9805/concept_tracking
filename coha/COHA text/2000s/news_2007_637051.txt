<p> Are you a poet and do n't . . . show it ? ( And your parents hope you 'll outgrow it ? ) If so , today is your lucky day . We 'll give you some tips for writing a kind of poem called a limerick , and then you can show off your rhyme and talent . <p> That might make everyone green with envy on St. Patrick 's Day , which is Saturday . The Irish are known for poems and stories , but everyone has that spirit of fun . I 'm not Irish , but I got into the mood by writing this : <p> There once was a stylish colleen <p> Who always wore socks that were green . <p> When she put on her shoes , <p> She said , " I 've got the blues , <p> ' Cause my pretty green socks ca n't be seen ! " <p> I call it an Irish poem because it includes the Irish word " colleen , " which means girl . And it 's a limerick  --  which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've seen limericks ( and maybe even written them in class ) . They 're little poems that are funny , or sometimes just silly . <p> They are written a special way . The first two lines and the fifth line are the same length and rhyme . The third and fourth lines are shorter and have a different rhyme . <p> Nobody knows why limericks are named for Limerick . But who cares ? Limericks can be about any place . Let me make up one about a city in Georgia : <p> There was an old man from Calhoun <p> Who wanted to drive to the moon . <p> But he could n't get far <p> Without gas in his car , <p> So he stayed home and played a sad tune . <p> Most limericks start with something like " There was somebody from somewhere . . . . " But they do n't have to . Let me see if I can write one that does n't . How about this ? <p> A boy who went shopping for cheese <p> Came home with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make honey <p> So we can make money , " <p> But his parents said , " Take them back , please ! " <p> The most famous person who ever wrote limericks was an English poet and artist named Edward Lear , who lived in the 1800s . He wrote what he called " nonsense , " including limericks , along with his own illustrations . He was the person who made it popular to start a limerick with a person and a place . Here 's one he wrote : <p> There was an Old Person of Cromer <p> Who stood on one leg to read Homer . <p> When he found he grew stiff , <p> He jumped over the cliff , <p> Which concluded that Person of Cromer . <p> And here 's another from Lear , just to show you more of his pattern : <p> There was an old person of Bray <p> Who sang through the whole of the day <p> To his ducks and his pigs , <p> Whom he fed upon figs , <p> That valuable person of Bray . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't so funny , and they really ARE nonsense . Maybe you also noticed that the way he ends them is kind of flat . It might seem a little boring . He does n't try to make a joke out of the last line . He just repeats something from the first line . <p> Today , we want to be more entertained ! Most limericks end with a joke in the last line , and sometimes ( we hope ) it 's funny . <p> Here 's a limerick I still remember from when I was a kid . It made me laugh then , and it still does . I do n't know who wrote it : <p> There was on old man of Peru <p> Who dreamed he was kissing his shoe . <p> He awoke in the night <p> In a terrible fright <p> And found it was perfectly true . <p> If you 're writing a limerick , do n't be afraid to get goofy . It 's a goofy form . Let me see if I can think goofily : <p> There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his tooth . <p> He sewed rugs with his horn <p> And raised prize-winning corn . <p> It 's funny , but it 's not the truth ! <p> Because limericks are done for fun , some writers make the last line very long , or very short  --  or even get rid of it ! <p> Let 's try it . I 'll use the name of a politician who 's in the news today . He 's a senator from Illinois named Barack Obama . My limerick does n't have anything to do with politics  --  but I had fun rhyming his name . <p> I could use a rhyme for " Obama , " <p> But all I can think of is " mama . " <p> But I know other tricks  --  <p> When there 's no word that clicks , <p> I just ended the line with a , <p> ( Hint : Read the last line out loud . ) <p> Now it 's your turn ! <p> Try writing a limerick . Then read it out loud to your class . See if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town or school  --  or even a friend  --  at the end of the first line . Use one of these to get started : <p> A leprechaun I met from <p> or <p> There was a cool kid named <p> or <p> I woke up in the town of <p> or <p> A school with wild rules is <p> or <p> St. Patrick 's Day in <p> ANOTHER IRISH TRADITION <p> If you 're in the mood to hear more about Ireland , you might try a fun book called " King Puck , " by Michael Garland . It 's a great Irish story to read out loud to a holiday crowd . And no , it 's not about St. Patrick 's Day ! Instead , it 's about Ireland 's oldest and most unusual fair : the King Puck Festival . <p> That festival , when a goat is crowned " king " of Ireland for a day in August , is pretty strange . But this book makes it even more funny , with help from a farmer and his unusual goat . And let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings . They help tell the story of Irish luck and dreams . <p> HAVE MORE TIME FOR SILLY RHYMES ? <p> Then you might enjoy these children 's books : <p> * " Lots of Limericks " by Myra Cohn Livingston .
