The unlikely story of J.R.R. Tolkien , a tweedy Oxford professor whose beloved LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy has made him lord of the pop-culture realm * By JEFF GORDINIER // IT 'S AN OVERCAST SUNDAY MORNING in the suburbs of Oxford , England , and here in Wolvercote Cemetery , a crowd has gathered around a headstone with four names on it . Two of the names are recognizably human : John Ronald Reuel Tolkien and Edith Mary Tolkien , husband and wife , both of whom entered our world in the 19th century and departed in the 20th . Carved underneath those names are two more-names that mean something to you only if you 're fluent in the complicated lore of Middle-earth . These are Beren and Luthien , respectively . Beren is the name of a man from the age of Morgoth , and Luthien is the name of an elf . * Over the years , so many people have come to pay homage to J.R.R. Tolkien , the author of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit , that the earth sags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the puzzle of detritus that you tend to find around famous headstones : a green jar , six yellow roses , a tiny metal fairy , a scorpion amulet . But today 's congregation is a lot different from , say , the deathwish cowboys who balance empty bottles of Wild Turkey at the foot of Hank Williams ' resting place in Alabama . This feels like a solemn diplomatic rite-the anniversary of the Rescue at Dunkirk , maybe . About 100 people are standing in a loose semicircle , and they 've bowed their heads . Two wreaths-abloom with roses , carnations , and daisies-are placed on the ground , one on each side of the grave . * This is Enyalie , a ceremony that serves as the climax of Oxonmoot , an annual three-day festival that 's been held by the Tolkien Society since around 1974 . Much of the weekend tends to be rowdier and kookier than this-and rightly so , since Oxonmoot coincides with the fabled Sept. 22 birthday blowout of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins-but it comes to a head with a yearly rite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wolvercote has the sacred tenor of a pilgrimage . " At Enyalie , there is a sense of stillness and reverence . I remember Tolkien and his wife . I think of the tradition , " says Anders Stenstrom , a Swedish participant who 's going by the Middle-earth name of Beregond . " Although Tolkien is someone I have never met , I 've seen a part of him .

The man is everywhere . " When you inhale air , it 's made up of oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen , and other elements , " says Phish drummer Jon Fishman , who , naturally , played in a high school band called Frodo . " Tolkien is part of the molecules you breathe in your artistic surroundings , whether or not you 've actually ever read Tolkien . " Globally , Tolkien has sold some 100 million books , yes , and he ignited the whole fantasy genre in publishing , sure , and he enjoyed ( or endured ) a fantastic surge in popularity at the crest of the lysergic ' ' 60s , but .. well , it 's bigger than that . On a grander scale , Tolkien tapped the collective geek lust for data . Cult following ? You could argue that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate " fans " ; it colonized the planet with people who could tell you the Quenya word for spring , or the number of miles from Bree to the foothills of Ered Mithrin . The world he created-secret tongues , weird species , lost hamlets , invisible mountains of arcana-would become the cultural locus for everything from Star Wars and Star TRek to Led Zeppelin stomps , Dungeons &; Dragons , and Myst . Yet , like air , Tolkien is invisible . Most people have no idea what he looked like . Which is not entirely his fault . Despite rumors to the contrary , he was never some Salinger-style hermit ; during Tolkien 's 34-year stretch as a professor at Oxford University , students could often see him heading into St. Aloysius Church for mass , or sharing an ale and an Icelandic saga with colleagues like C.S. Lewis , the author of The Chronicles of Narnia , at a pub called the Eagle and Child , still in operation on St. Giles Street . If he was able to dodge the blackest side of celebrity  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so frumpy , that he just preferred sticking to the pleasures of his daily routine instead of climbing aboard some jet bound for Manhattan or Hollywood . In fact , he never even visited America ; on the night in 1966 when writer Truman Capote was bedazzling Gotham with his glitz-drunk Black &; White Ball , Tolkien was most likely tucked away in his study , alone , maybe fine-tuning the geography of the Imlad Morgul . As a result , the man is everywhere and nowhere-with one hairy hobbit 's foot in our world and the other a quantum leap away . As Enyalie winds down , Denis Bridoux , a Frenchman in boots and a black leather , jacket , steps forward to sing . He launches into Galadriel 's farewell song from Chapter VIII of The Lord of the Rings . In spite of Oxford 's rumbling traffic and a squirrel heckling from the branch of a tree , Bridoux sounds like a Benedictine monk filling an abbey with chant . He is n't singing in Latin , though . He 's singing in Elvish-a language that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exist : Ai ! laurie lantar lassi surinen yeni unotime ve ramar aldaron ! Yeni ve linte yuldar avanier mi oromardi lisse-miruvoreva Andune ' pella , Vardo tellumar nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni omaryo airetari-lirinen ... WHO WERE THESE PEOPLE ? They tracked you down , they sent you presents , they asked silly questions . Here Professor Tolkien had spent 12 years on The Lord of the Rings , mapping out every mountain and glen of Middle-earth as if he were raising a cathedral in the clouds , and now a throng was passing through his private sanctuary for a gawk . Tourists , TV crews , drug freaks , scholars with their wild-goose theories and pontifications . Somebody was asked to write an introduction to the Swedish edition of Rings , and the man filled it with a bunch of " presumptuous impertinence " and " outrageous nonsense " about Tolkien 's teaching career , his family life , even his childhood . How did he come up with this stuff ? " Why should I be made an object of fiction while still alive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him at his writing desk-just relax , Professor , please look natural . That sort of thing . Tolkien shot back : " Your ideas of the natural and mine are different , since I never in any circumstances do work while being photographed , or talked to , or accompanied by anybody in the room . A photograph of me pretending to be at work would be entirely bogus . " Besides , what was there to embellish ? He was a quiet man . Polite . Fond of routine . A Catholic , he went to mass steadily and dutifully . Born to Arthur and Mabel Tolkien on Jan. 3 , 1892 , in South Africa . ( Mabel was fond of " Ronald , " while Arthur favored " John " and " Reuel " - Arthur 's own middle name-so the parents stuck all three names together . ) Father , a banker , had died there of a severe hemorrhage from rheumatic fever in 1896 .

( True , she was older , and Anglican , and Father Francis Morgan-Ronald 's guardian-had forbidden them to see each other for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but , well , he did n't tend to talk about that , either .... ) Lending credence to the John Houseman-style stereotype of a fusty professor , he smoked a pipe and wore tweed blazers and rode around Oxford on a bicycle . After World War II , he did n't even own a car . He kept a diary , but if there was anything salacious in it , you were n't likely to find out , because much of the journal was full of graceful runic symbols that only Tolkien could decipher . Seen from the surface , his life was so humdrum and conservative that this sentence would pop up halfway through Humphrey Carpenter 's 1977 Tolkien biography : " And after this , you might say , nothing else really happened . " The year in question was 1925 . Tolkien was 33 . There was a story to tell , of course , but it had to do with words-something the outside world had little interest in . There were two torrid romances in Tolkien 's life : Edith and words . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imaginary languages , " Tolkien wrote in 1951 . " I have been at it since I could write . " Words were what escorted him into academe . He became a philologist , specializing in the history of language and literature . Words were what chaperoned him into the shires of his imagination . He was bewitched by old myths and sagas-Norse , Teutonic , Icelandic , Finnish-and in the late hours of the night , while his wife and children slept , he dabbled with a few of his own . " When he worked on a language , he did n't just create a language , " says Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey , a professor at Saint Louis University in Missouri . " He had to create a history for it . " What ensued was a sort of private Genesis : Languages led to names , names to places , and places to a vast , Byzantine cosmology-maps and calendars , war stories and family trees , ancient alphabets and forgotten species . " He realized that you ca n't have languages if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world that their words describe , " says University of Maryland professor Verlyn Flieger , another Tolkien scholar . " And so he began to flesh out the world . " It was during a summer around 1930 that Tolkien 's hermetic galaxy made its first real spurt toward the public arena . He was sitting in his study , flipping through a stack of student exams , when he came to a blank page . Impulsively he jotted down the following sentence : " In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit . " Tolkien wrote The Hobbit for his own children , originally . But the adventures of a hirsute  --  toed tunnel-dweller named Bilbo Baggins found a publisher anyway , thanks in part to a 10-year-old boy . Sir Stanley Unwin , chairman of the venerable British publishing house George Allen &; Unwin , had a habit of passing manuscripts along to his son , Rayner , who 'd file a critique . " He got paid a shilling for each report he wrote , " says Clay Harper , an editor who oversees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houghton Mifflin . " Sir Stanley 's view was that if his kid liked it , then probably many kids would like it , so he would publish it . " The kid liked The Hobbit very much . It came out in 1937 . It sold well .

" Tolkien was a famous procrastinator and perfectionist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By now his vision of Middle-earth had swelled to huge proportions . He became fixed on microcosmic details-weather and foliage and how to pronounce words like Nargothrond and Grishnakh . Once , he wrote a chapter with a full moon in it , then rewrote the whole thing because he determined that the Middle-earth calendar would n't allow for a full moon at that point in the story . By the time he was done , his editors were on the verge of giving up , and Tolkien himself was n't sure what to make of the leviathan known as The Lord of the Rings . " My work has escaped from my control , " he wrote to Allen &; Unwin in 1950 , " and I have produced a monster : an immensely long , complex , rather bitter , and rather terrifying romance , quite unfit for children ( if fit for anybody ) .... " Indeed , the hulking Rings saga-eventually split up into three parts , much to the author 's annoyance-looked at first like a sort of art-house anomaly . ( As quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The New York Times : " Nobody seems to have a moderate opinion ; either , like myself , people find it a masterpiece of the genre , or they can not abide it . " ) From 1954 to 1965 , U.S. sales were okay , but miles away from the Heroic Plateau of Blockbuster . " Before the paperback came out , it probably sold in this country maybe , maybe 15,000 copies , " Harper says . " Not many . The Hobbit had been pretty successful , but The Lord of the Rings as a hardcover was always a pretty big beast to tackle . " It would take a battle to rip the beast out of its cage . By 1965 there was still no paperback version of the trilogy , so Ace Books , an American company with a hungry eye on the growing sci-fi and fantasy market , decided to put one out-without telling Tolkien , without notifying his publisher , and without paying the author any royalties . It was a gambit : Ace , the home of hipster scribes like Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now in the public domain because Houghton Mifflin had imported too many copies from Britain , thereby forfeiting their copyright . So , just as psychedelia started to cast an incense-and-peppermints spell on American kids , Ace was flooding bookstores with thousands of 75-cent pirate installments of Lord of the Rings . Tolkien fought back . Though his publishers and Ace would eventually reach an out-of-court settlement , the real triumph came from a noisy barrage of counter-publicity . Tolkien teamed up with Ballantine Books to stuff the racks with his own authorized paperback ; meanwhile , in ads and letters , he rallied readers to steer clear of the corrupt Ace version and pick up Ballantine 's instead . Paradoxically , the scandal worked wonders for Tolkien 's bank account . ( A recent item on Forbes.com ranked him richer than Frank Sinatra and Jerry Garcia among dead celebrities . ) The Ace-Ballantine skirmish had turned Rings into a phenomenon . " Once the genie was out of the bottle , there was no putting it back , " Harper says . " The brouhaha over the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public that had n't stumbled upon it already , and it made for 100 percent name recognition among booksellers . " Pretty soon Rings was selling hundreds of thousands of copies a month-becoming , overnight , the magic carpet of choice for a shaggy army of synaptic explorers . Tolkien watched the hubbub from his study in Oxford , bemused , unaware that the shell of his cocoon was about to be punctured . " My campaign in U.S.A. has gone well , " he wrote in a letter to his son Michael on the day before Halloween in 1965 . " I am getting such an advt. from the rumpus that I expect my " authorized " paper-back will in fact sell more copies than it would , if there had been no trouble or competition . " PEOPLE PASSED IT ALONG LIKE A love note . Somebody-an older brother or an English teacher or the bassist in your band-would press a ratty , broken-spined book into your hands , and you 'd get sucked in . Probably it was the Ballantine paperback , with all those weird animals on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord of the Rings . ( " Where is this place ? " Tolkien wrote to Rayner Unwin in 1965 , after seeing the Ballantine cover . " Why a lion and emus ? And what is the thing in the foreground with pink bulbs ?

" I remember how complete the world seemed to be , " he says . " That 's got to be the part that affected me . " Years later , Miller and his brother Robyn would create Myst and Riven , computer games that laid out the same kind of limitless landscapes . Jon Anderson , the teapot-pitched singer from the prog-rock titans Yes , found The Hobbit in a London bookstore and wound up soaking in the Tolkien canon when he climbed on a tour bus .

" There 's a lot of things going on in the beautiful mountainside that we , as humans , do n't relate to , " he says . " Tolkien was like a door opener for me . " Actually , doors were being smacked off their hinges . By the late ' ' 60s , wizards , dragons , elves , and ores had burrowed into every crag and gully of the pop consciousness . A slogan showed up on lapel pins : Frodo Lives . Led Zeppelin lyrics overflowed with nods to Gollum and Mordor and the Misty Mountains . In what qualified as a megamerger between two nascent cults , Star Trek 's Leonard Nimoy cut a catchy , borderline-deranged ditty called " Ballad of Bilbo Baggins . " " He thought it was the corniest thing he 'd ever heard , but I talked him into recording it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got the idea that hey , you know , Tolkien was sort of an underground hit .... " So ubiquitous was Middle-earth mania that in 1969 , The Harvard Lampoon saw fit to put out a parody book : Bored of the Rings . Fans called from thousands of miles away , neglectful of time zones , thirsty for answers . They woke up the professor so many times that he had to take precautionary steps . ( " Thank you very much for your suggestions about my telephone number , which I will consider , " Tolkien wrote to his publishing house in 1966 . " Removing the number from the directory seems better than the method adopted by Major W.H. Lewis in protecting his brother , which was to lift the receiver and say , " Oxford Sewage Disposal Unit " and go on repeating it until they went away . " ) To the professor , age 75 by the Summer of Love , a hobbit made more sense than a hippie . " I remember his secretary telling me that she used to keep things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shippey says . " She told me once about a hippie who sent a long letter about how , in a kind of drug-induced stupor , he had climbed to the top of a mountain , built a fire , and burned his wedding ring . She said , " Well , I was n't going to tell Tolkien that . ' ' " Faced with such dire misinterpretations , Tolkien was all too happy to correct people-often with a long letter . Alas , too late ; his private enterprise was destined to become whatever the masses wanted to make of it . Theories abound-that his work got swept up in the mind-expansion vogue , that his fantasias provided an escape from Vietnam body counts . People point out , with a wink , the profusion of pipe-weed toking and mushroom eating within the Middle-earth milieu . " Totally drugs , " Anderson says . " Totally marijuana . " If to be great is to be misunderstood , then Tolkien was a colossus , trailing a flurry of warped conjecture behind him . Had the freak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an old-fashioned view of romantic love at the core of Tolkien 's work . Anybody who 's read Rings-or Tolkien 's other teeming compendium of myth , The Silmarillion-knows the tale of Beren , a mortal man , and Luthien , an elf princess who gave up her immortality in order to stay with the man she loved . In Rings it 's a story told in passing , around a campfire . Th Tolkien it was full of private significance . The story of Beren and Luthien is the place where his two passions come together-words and his wife . Edith died two years before her husband did , and in his grief the author wrote a letter to his son Christopher . " I have at last got busy about Mummy 's grave , " he said . He had plans for the inscription : EDITH MARY TOLKIEN 1889-1971 LUTHIEN Tolkien urged his children not to feel " that the use of this name is a sentimental fancy . " Giving Edith the name of an elven princess " says for me more than a multitude of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Lu thien . " Not that he 'd ever explain that in an autobiography . Such a task , he wrote Christopher , " is against my nature , which expresses itself about things deepest felt in tales and myths .
