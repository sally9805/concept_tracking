Chapter One I was seven years old . What do you know when you 're seven years old ? All my life , or so I thought , we 'd been in the city of Alexandria , in the Street of the Carpenters , with the other Galileans , and sooner or later we were going home . Late afternoon . We were playing , my gang against his , and when he ran at me again , bully that he was , bigger than me , and catching me off balance , I felt the power go out of me as I shouted : " You 'll never get where you 're going . " He fell down white in the sandy earth , and they all crowded around him . The sun was hot and my chest was heaving as I looked at him . He was so limp . In the snap of two fingers everyone drew back . It seemed the whole street went quiet except for the carpenters ' hammers . I 'd never heard such a quiet . " He 's dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it up . " He 's dead , he 's dead , he 's dead . " I knew it was true . He was a bundle of arms and legs in the beaten dust . And I was empty . The power had taken everything with it , all gone . His mother came out of the house , and her scream went up the walls into a howl . From everywhere the women came running . My mother lifted me off my feet . She carried me down the street and through the courtyard and into the dark of our house . All my cousins crowded in with us , and James , my big brother , pulled the curtain shut . He turned his back on the light . He said : " Jesus did it . He killed him . " He was afraid . " Do n't you say such a thing ! " said my mother . She clutched me so close to her , I could scarcely breathe . Big Joseph woke up . Now Big Joseph was my father , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him Father . I 'd been taught to call him Joseph . I did n't know why . He 'd been asleep on the mat . We 'd worked all day on a job in Philo 's house , and he and the rest of the men had lain down in the heat of the afternoon to sleep . He climbed to his feet . " What 's that shouting outside ? " he asked . " What 's happened ? " He looked to James . James was his eldest son . James was the son of a wife who had died before Joseph married my mother . James said it again . " Jesus killed Eleazer . Jesus cursed him and he fell down dead . " Joseph stared at me , his face still blank from sleep . There was more and more shouting in the street . He rose to his feet , and ran his hands back through his thick curly hair . My little cousins were slipping through the door one by one and crowding around us . My mother was trembling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He would n't do such a thing . " " I saw it , " said James . " I saw it when he made the sparrows out of clay on the Sabbath . The teacher told him he should n't do such things on the Sabbath . Jesus looked at the birds and they turned into real birds . They flew away . You saw it too . He killed Eleazer , Mother , I saw it . " My cousins made a ring of white faces in the shadows : Little Joses , Judas , and Little Symeon and Salome , watching anxiously , afraid of being sent out . Salome was my age , and my dearest and closest . Salome was like my sister . Then in came my mother 's brother Cleopas , always the talker , who was the father of these cousins , except for Big Silas who came in now , a boy older than James . He went into the corner , and then came his brother , Justus , and both wanted to see what was going on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cleopas , " Jonathan bar Zakkai , and his brothers , they 're saying Jesus killed their boy . They 're envious that we got that job at Philo 's house , they 're envious that we got the other job before that , they 're envious that we 're getting more and more jobs , they 're so sure they do things better than we do- . " " Is the boy dead ? " Joseph said . " Or is the boy alive ? " Salome shot forward and whispered in my ear . " Just make him come alive , Jesus , the way you made the birds come alive ! " Little Symeon was giggling . He was too little to know what was going on . Little Judas knew , but he was quiet . " Stop , " said James , the little boss of the children . " Salome , be quiet . " I could hear them shouting in the street . I heard other noises . Stones were hitting the walls of the house . My mother started to cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleopas and he rushed back out through the door . Joseph went after him . I wriggled out of my mother 's grasp and darted out before she could catch me , and past my uncle and Joseph and right into the crowd as they were all waving and hollering and shaking their fists . I went so fast , they did n't even see me . I was like a fish in the river . I moved in and out through people who were shouting over my head until I got to Eleazer 's house . The women all had their backs to the door , and they did n't see me as I went around the edge of the room . I went right into the dark room , where they 'd laid him on the mat . His mother was there leaning on her sister and sobbing . There was only one lamp , very weak . Eleazer was pale with his arms at his sides , same soiled tunic , and the soles of his feet very black . He was dead . His mouth was open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek physician came in-he was really a Jew-and he knelt down , and he looked at Eleazer and he shook his head . Then he saw me and said : " Out . " His mother turned and she saw it was me and she screamed . I bent over him : " Wake up , Eleazer , " I said . " Wake up now . " I reached out and laid my hand on his forehead . The power went out . My eyes closed . I was dizzy . But I heard him draw in his breath . His mother screamed over and over and it hurt my ears . Her sister screamed . All the women were screaming . I fell back on the floor . I was weak . The Greek physician was staring down at me . I was sick . The room was dim . Other people had rushed in . Eleazer came up , and he was up all knees and fists before anyone could get to him , and he set on me and punched me and hit me , and knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again : " Son of David , Son of David ! " he shouted , mocking me , " Son of David , Son of David ! " kicking me in the face , and in the ribs , until his father grabbed him around the waist and picked him up in the air . I ached all over , could n't breathe . " Son of David ! " Eleazer kept shouting . Someone lifted me and carried me out of the house and into the crowd in the street . I was still gasping . I hurt all over . It seemed the whole street was screaming , worse than before , and someone said the Teacher was coming , and my uncle Cleopas was yelling in Greek at Jonathan , Eleazer 's father , and Jonathan was yelling back , and Eleazer was shouting , " Son of David , Son of David ! " I was in Joseph 's arms . He was trying to move , but the crowd would n't let him . Cleopas was pushing at Eleazer 's father . Eleazer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men took hold of his arms . I heard Eleazer shouting far away . There was the Teacher declaring : " That child 's not dead , you hush up , Eleazer , who said he was dead ? Eleazer , stop shouting ! Whoever could think this child is dead ? " " Brought him back to life , that 's what he did , " said one of theirs . We were in our courtyard , the entire crowd had pushed in with us , my uncle and Eleazer 's people still screaming at each other , and the Teacher demanding order . Now my uncles , Alphaeus and Simon , had come . These were Joseph 's brothers . And they 'd just woken up . They put up their hands against the crowd . Their mouths were hard and their eyes were big . My aunts , Salome and Esther and Mary , were there , with all the cousins running and jumping as if this were a festival , except for Silas and Justus and James who stood with the men . Then I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had taken me into the front room . It was dark . Aunt Esther and Aunt Salome came in with her . I could hear stones hitting the house again . The Teacher raised his voice in Greek . " There 's blood on your face ! " my mother whispered . " Your eye , there 's blood . Your face is cut ! " She was crying . " Oh , look what 's happened to you , " she said . She spoke in Aramaic , our tongue which we did n't speak very much . " I 'm not hurt , " I said . I meant to say it did n't matter . Again my cousins pressed close , Salome smiling as if to say she knew I could bring him back to life , and I took her hand and squeezed it . But there was James with his hard look . The Teacher came into the room backwards with his hands up . Someone ripped the curtain away and the light was very bright . Joseph and his brothers came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move to make room . " You 're talking about Joseph and Cleopas and Alphaeus , what do you mean drive them out ! " said the Teacher to the whole crowd . " They 've been with us for seven years ! " The angry family of Eleazer came almost into the room . The father himself did come into the room . " Yes , seven years and why do n't they go back to Galilee , all of them ! " Eleazer 's father shouted . " Seven years is too long ! That boy is possessed of a demon and I tell you my son was dead ! " " Are you complaining that he 's alive now ! What 's the matter with you ! " demanded my uncle Cleopas . ( Continues ... )
