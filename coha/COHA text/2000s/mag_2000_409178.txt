AS A DEDICATED GALAXY HUNTER , I 've long been intrigued by the possibilities of viewing galaxies that lie hidden behind the veil of the Milky Way . Before astronomers realized that so-called spiral nebulae were in fact galaxies , the very placement of these misty patches of light was a source of mystery . In the 19th century William and John Herschel first noticed that they tended to avoid the broad band of the Milky Way . Later , in the 20th century , Edwin Hubble simply called this seemingly peculiar region the " Zone of Avoidance . " Today , this zone is no longer a mystery . The dust and gas that cloud the plane of our galaxy effectively absorb and block the distant light from these island universes . In the direction of the constellation Sagittarius , this extinction can exceed 20 magnitudes , and even in the relatively diffuse winter Milky Way a drop of 5 to 10 magnitudes is not unusual . Yet some galaxies do manage to shine through hundreds or even thousands of light-years of Milky Way dust and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few showpieces in the obscure northern constellation Camelopardalis.The galaxy is included in Patrick Moore 's Caldwell Catalog ( C5 ) as among the sky 's most impressive non-Messier objects . Photograph This Palomar Observatory Sky Survey image shows a 1 deg swath of sky rich with Milky Way forground stars and a couple denizens of the deep sky : the galaxies Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 . The clumping of faint stars overlying Maffei 1 is the cluster Cz 11 . Sh 2  --  195 is likely too faint to be observed visually . // Perhaps the closest and best-studied cluster of galaxies lurking behind . the Milky Way is the IC 342/Maffei group . Composed of at least 16 members , this loose collection of galaxies lies an estimated 10 to 13 million light-years away and stretches across the constellations Camelopardalis , Cassiopeia , and Perseus . Like our own Local Group , this collection consists of two large spirals , along with several smaller ones and a host of dwarf galaxies . However , it also includes something the Local Group lacks - a giant elliptical ( Maffei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of object . The cluster can be subdivided into two smaller subgroups , one surrounding the bright spiral IC 342 and the other centered on Maffei 1 . The IC 342 Subgroup For the observer , the IC 342 subgroup is the most logical place to start . The extinction levels range from slight to moderate ; consequently , several galaxies are relatively easy finds , even in small instruments . The first is IC 342 , a large galaxy inclined 250 to our line of sight . It is a spiral similar in size and luminosity to our own but suffering about 2 magnitudes of extinction . Spanning more than 20 ' and shining at a deceptively bright magnitude 8.3 , this object can be rather tricky to observe . In their Observing Handbook and Catalogue of Deep-Sky Objects ( Cambridge University Press , 1989 ) , Christian Luginbuhl and Brian Skiff describe its appearance in a 60-millimeter refractor as a " faint blob north of a loose clustering of stars . " However , it can prove troublesome in much larger scopes . My first experience with IC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnham 's Celestial Handbook . Undaunted by Burnham 's description of an object " difficult for small telescopes " I used an 8-inch f/7 reflector and was able to locate a tiny 12th-magnitude core surrounded by a weak glow . In larger scopes this core is a complex mass of light and dark knots less than 30 " across . Only with the Atlanta Astronomy Club 's ( AAC ) 24-inch Dobsonian have I had much success in tracing out the long , wispy arcs of its spiral arms . For a tougher challenge , try observing IC 342 's satellite galaxy UGCA 86 . Weakly visible as a diffuse glow about 1 ' across in the AAC 's 20-inch reflector , it provides good practice for some of the galaxy group 's most highly obscured members . Not all galaxies in this cluster are difficult objects that challenge even experienced observers . The unusual irregular galaxy NGC 1569 has a high surface brightness and is easily visible with small telescopes . Larger scopes reveal intriguing details . In my old 13.1-inch Dobsonian , I could see a bright 2.5 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifts . This object takes high magnification well , so do n't be afraid to use it . // IC 342 Galaxy Group Photograph These eyepiece impressions were recorded by the author while using the 20-inch reflector telescope of the Atlanta Astronomy Club . North is up . // Markedly different in character is NGC 1560 , an irregular galaxy located 70 due north of NGC 1569 . Discovered in 1885 , it is a nearly edge-on system remarkably similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud . Unlike IC 342 , it suffers from only mild extinction of about a half magnitude . Telescopically , it appears as a large , elongated , diffuse disk oriented nearly north-south against a rich star field . Observers using apertures larger than 15 inches may see a weakly condensed core and some surface mottling . Giants in the Mists All the galaxies associated with the Maffei 1 subgroup are highly obscured by galactic dust , making them difficult targets well suited to the observer who enjoys a challenge . Many of the member galaxies have been discovered within the past 30 years - some as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nebulae lying within the Milky Way . Maffei 1 is a case in point . This system was originally classified as an emission nebula in 1953 by Stewart Sharpless ( later designated Sh 2-191 ) before it was recognized as a galaxy in 1968 by the Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei . Its true nature was effectively clouded by severe extinction of more than 5 magnitudes and the foreground open cluster Czernik ( Cz ) 11 , positioned in front of it . On Palomar Observatory Sky Survey ( POSS ) images , only the inner 3 ' of the giant elliptical are visible , while deep images by Ron Buta and Marshall McCall reveal a far more extensive object . Although it shines at 11.1 magnitude , the galaxy has an extremely low surface brightness . In spite of this , the core has been observed by amateurs using instruments as small as 12.5 inches . With the AACs 20-inch at 229X , I spotted a broad misty glow of about 3 ' by 2 ' on the eastern side of Cz 11 . Less than 45 ' to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , it was previously classified as a bright nebula ( Sh 2-197 ) before its true nature was discovered . Deep images show a spectacular spiral measuring more than 17 ' across , but most observers will be lucky just to spot the small core region . With the 20-inch , all I could see was a small , diffuse glow measuring a mere V across . Even more challenging is Dwingeloo 1 lying about 20 east-southeast of Maffei 2 . Discovered in 1994 , this M33-size barred spiral is at least as obscured as the Maffei pair ( see page 23 ) . At magnitude 13.1 it is one tough customer . Using 260X , all I could pick out was a very weak , oval bar appearing about 2 ' by 1 ' ' . I am not sure that the nearby dwarf galaxy , Dwingeloo 2 , has been observed by anyone . However , since most of the light from these galaxies is in the red to infrared end of the spectrum , they should make excellent targets for CCD cameras , which typically have excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sky would be if this collection of galaxies did n't suffer from so much galactic extinction . Maffei 1 and 2 and IC 342 would be naked-eye objects , while Dwingeloo I would shine at about 8th magnitude . These three would have caught Charles Messier 's eye and would have been enshrined in his famous 18thcentury catalog . Amateurs would regard the Maffei pair as one of the most spectacular showpieces in the sky - two beautiful 6th-magnitude galaxies in a 1 deg field of view ! If only the Milky Way were n't in the way . Author Affiliation RICHARD JAKIEL is a tireless galaxy hunter and regular contributor to Deep-Sky Notebook .
