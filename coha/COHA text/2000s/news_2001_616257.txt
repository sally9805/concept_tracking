<p> It 's an off year for the National Black Arts Festival , Atlanta 's biennial blowout celebrating African-influenced dance , literature , music and theater . <p> But do n't tell Talahia Jackson . She 's really looking forward to enslaving a few children this week . Binding their hands . Booking them on a slave ship . <p> The 16-year-old student at Booker T. Washington High School is part of the evolving NBAF , a youth leader trained to direct younger kids through a series of historical games , including enslavement re-enactments , at the Children 's Education Village during the NBAF 's " Summer Celebration , " this Thursday through Saturday at the Atlanta University Center . <p> " We learn stuff we did n't know about our ancestors , " Jackson says . " That we were not slaves . We were people in slavery . " <p> It 's an off year for the National Black Arts Festival . No need to mention that to Laura Greer . <p> As the NBAF 's chief programmer , Greer has been working to restage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through at last summer 's festival . At that point , she knew the event could stand on its own  --  even in a festival off year  --  filling a void for educational family entertainment . <p> " We really wanted to pay more attention to the family audience that the festival naturally attracts , " Greer says . " Our hope is that it will grow to become its own festival , a festival for young people that young people create and manage . " <p> It 's an off year for the National Black Arts Festival . And there 's a whole lot going on . Atlanta 's only major multidisciplinary arts festival  --  created by the Fulton County Arts Council in 1988  --  is reinventing itself institutionally , strategically and programmatically . <p> When it 's all over , this may be the last off year it has for a long time . <p> After eliminating its deficit during a scaled-back festival in 2000 ( budget : $1.8 million ) , the NBAF is morphing from hibernating biennial festival to full-time arts-and-humanities institution . <p> Beginning next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of once every other summer . Next year 's budget will be close to $2 million , well below the high of $2.8 million in 1996 , when the festival accompanied the Cultural Olympiad . Still , that 's nearly miraculous when you consider the shaky 1998 event , which ended with a $705,000 deficit and left many wondering whether the festival would be snuffed out for good along with the old millennium . <p> In the interim , the NBAF is launching a series of mini-festivals and independent shows to increase its visibility and influence throughout the year . The first is this week 's Summer Celebration , featuring the Children 's Education Village and other family events . ( See schedule , Page L6 ) . <p> In the fall , the NBAF plans to sponsor a preview of a new documentary called " This Far by Faith , " a chronicle of the African-American religious experience . ( Details have not been finalized . ) It 's produced by Blackside Productions of Boston , makers of the Emmy Award-winning civil rights documentary " Eyes on the Prize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fund-raiser its first-ever holiday marketplace at the City Hall East Exhibition Center , displaying the crafts and creations of artists who typically take part in the summer event . <p> " Two things I know about Atlanta , " says festival Executive Producer Stephanie Hughley , who helped organize the first three festivals before returning in 1999 . " People will always shop , and they will go to a party . So I decided to have a shopping party every December . " <p> Also in December , the NBAF will announce its lineup for the 2002 festival . Do n't be surprised to see jazz trumpeter-composer Wynton Marsalis and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater among the headliners . Or a video installation by New York artist Demetria Royals at the entrance to the festival 's Studioplex headquarters on Auburn Avenue . <p> Hughley is also considering changing the NBAF 's name . Slightly . The National Black Arts Foundation is one possibility that would emphasize the organization 's seismic structural changes and the fact that it 's becoming much more than a festival . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying the same . <p> Stephanie Hughley is all over the map . At a music festival in France . Meeting with AOL Time Warner in New York . Seeing Nigel Redden , the director of Manhattan 's Lincoln Center Festival and Charleston 's Spoleto Festival USA . Meeting with DaimlerChrysler . Meeting with Woodruff Arts Center President Shelton Stanfill . Meeting with poet Maya Angelou . Working with the Ford Foundation . Getting grants from Coca-Cola ( $200,000 ) . From the Nathan Cummings Foundation ( $100,000 ) . Calling the Smithsonian Institution . And new Alliance Theatre chief Susan V. Booth . ( " Did n't you love what they did with ' Spinning Into Butter ' ? " ) Talking with institutions in the Caribbean , South America and Africa . <p> At lunch at a Japanese restaurant in Midtown , Hughley eschews the raw menu ; all her selections are cooked . But she 's got the lingo of the nonprofit world down cold . She 's talking partnerships and consumer bases . Program modules . The mission . The process . The synergy . The product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have to discuss is the deficit . There is none . Instead , she 's explaining her crash course in marketing and the development of her first business plan . ( " Whoa , was it complicated ! " ) <p> Out of the business plan came the decision to produce an annual festival . The biennial had become confusing and limiting to audiences and sponsors alike . <p> " You can not build an identity on ' Is it this year ? ' " Hughley says . " You would say to people , ' You know about the black arts festival ? ' And they would say , ' Yeah  --  is it this year ? Was it last year ? ' <p> " All the major festivals in this country are annual festivals . It keeps the momentum going . " <p> The bottom line : An annual event makes the NBAF more attractive to corporate sponsors . Corporations crave reaching the diverse , educated audience the festival brings in  --  like the 15,000 members of Delta Sigma Theta sorority who are planning to gather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's not about getting a handout anymore because you 're a good arts organization and you make people feel good , " Hughley says . " That 's not enough in today 's world . It 's about business . We want to broaden our audience , and so do our sponsors . " <p> In making the transition , Hughley got advice from Redden , who annually juggles much bigger festivals in Manhattan and Charleston . Reached in New York , he endorsed the NBAF 's move to yearly status . <p> " I thought it would energize the festival enormously and build audiences and build donor support , " Redden says . " I 'm convinced most of us operate on daily , weekly and annual cycles . Few of us think in terms of a biennial cycle ; it 's not one of those cycles that occurs in our lives . For Spoleto , being there every May on Memorial Day , that 's enormously important to attracting and holding an audience . " <p> Going annual is n't a new idea for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax was brainstorming the festival . ( The Fulton County Arts Council remains a significant contributor , at $365,000 last year . County Commissioner Nancy Boxill is the festival 's new board chairwoman . ) <p> But in the early days , Lomax says , the festival 's founders , including Hughley , were n't certain that they could draw enough people or raise enough money for major programming on an annual basis . <p> As it turned out , crowds were no problem . Organizers say the festival routinely draws more than 1 million visitors . <p> " From the very first festival , we realized we had a much larger audience than we had anticipated , " says Lomax , now president of Dillard University in New Orleans and still an NBAF board member . <p> With a steady procession of events ahead , the NBAF staff has grown to nine full-time employees , and Hughley expects to hire two more before the year 's end . The hands are needed : Greer is scheduling events for 2003 and 2004 , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very daunting because this organization existed for 14 years without a real foundation or infrastructure , " says Judith Service Montier , who was hired earlier this year as director of marketing and development . " It 's like teaching a teenager how to walk . We 're creating the system as we go . " <p> Part of Montier 's job is to build a wider festival audience in all ways , so that some singularly creative bills  --  such as the pairing of Angelou with rhythm-and-blues duo Ashford &; Simpson at the 2000 event  --  do n't go unnoticed . <p> Diversity may be her bigger issue . Montier has just begun conducting focus groups that include " white people who had never been to the festival . " " <p> Despite solid overall attendance , most festival events still draw what Lomax calls " an overwhelmingly black audience . " <p> He feels that the revitalization of Studioplex and Auburn Avenue , along with anchoring the festival 's juried artists ' show and vendor marketplaces at the AU Center , are important steps in attracting more diverse crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlanta Civic Center , the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts and the Renaissance Atlanta Hotel  --  sometimes attract mixed crowds . But there 's only so much that the festival can be expected to achieve , Lomax says . <p> " I do n't think you can ask the festival to do something the world itself ca n't do , and the community ca n't do . On the other hand , I think the venues in the black community are venues that a more diverse audience will be comfortable with . Over time those audiences hopefully will integrate . " <p> Hughley feels that the challenge of bringing people together ideally fits the festival 's mission . <p> " The festival has always been a place where you can bring communities together to talk about issues that are tough to talk about outside the arts , " she says . " We 're in a great position right now to facilitate a lot of those conversations . " <p> But first things first . She has a Summer Celebration to produce this week . A film premiere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiz bowl for elementary schools in February . Then there 's a Web site update ( www.nbaf.org ) , through which she hopes soon to be selling festival merchandise . <p> " The real dollars are in marketing , " Hughley says with the relish of a salesman on a hot streak . " I do n't know who we 're going to be in 10 years . God , we may be a major business . " <p> But that 's a topic for later . After all , it 's an off year for the National Black Arts Festival .
