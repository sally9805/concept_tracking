Picking up on the meteorological theme , at left : mutual-fund investors can be a fair-weather bunch too , withdrawing and reinvesting money along with the market 's ups and downs . Problem is , they often act at the wrong time and make less than they would have if they had done nothing at all . While the S &P; 500 returned an annualized 12.2% from 1984 through 2002 , the average stock-fund investor saw a meager 2.6% yearly gain  --  which did n't even outpace inflation ( ringing in at 3.1% ) , according to a recent study by Boston research firm Dalbar Inc . The reason : the average investor held fund shares for just 30 months , often mistiming the market . Bond-fund investors held shares for 34 months on average , for an annualized return of 4.2% , which beat inflation but lagged government and company bond indexes .  --  B.K.
