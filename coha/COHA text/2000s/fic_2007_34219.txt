Chapter One IT 'S WAY TOO EARLY in the morning for dead people . That 's what I 'd be thinking , were I actually thinking clearly right now . I 'm not . The second I turn the corner on my way to work and see the crowd , the commotion , the dingy gray body bags being wheeled out of that oh-so-chichi hotel , I reach for my camera . I ca n't help it . It 's instinct on my part . Click , click , click . Do n't think about what 's happened here . Just shoot , Kristin . My head whips left and right , the lens of my Leica R9 leading the way . I focus first on the faces around me - the gawkers , the lookie-loos . That 's what Annie Leibovitz would do . A businessman in wide pinstripes , a bike messenger , a mother with her stroller , they all stand and stare at the terrible murder scene . Like it or not , this is the highlight of their day . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as something inside me is saying , " Look away , walk away . " Even as something says , " You know where you are . This hotel . You know , Kristin . " I 'm weaving my way toward the entrance to the hotel . Closer and closer , I 'm being pulled - as if by an undertow that I ca n't resist . And I keep shooting pictures as though I 'm on assignment for the New YorkTimes or Newsweek . Click , click , click . Parked at jagged angles , police cars and ambulances fill the street . I look up from their sirens , tracing the twirling beams of blue-and-red light as they dance against the surrounding brownstones . I spy more gawkers in the windows of nearby apartments . A woman wearing curlers takes a bite of a bagel . Click . Something catches my eye . It 's a reflection , the sun bouncing off the rail of the last gurney being wheeled out of the hotel . That makes four . What happened in there ? Murder ? Mass murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gurneys - each holding a body bag . It 's horrifying . Just awful . My wrist twists , and I go wide-angle to shoot them as a group - like a family . My wrist twists back , and I go tight , shooting them one by one . Who were they ? What happened to these poor people ? How did they die ? Do n't think , Kristin , just shoot . Two muscular paramedics walk out of the hotel and approach a couple of cops . Detectives , like on Law &; Order . They all talk , they all shake their heads , and they all have that hardened New York look to them , as if they 've seen it all before . One of the detectives - older , rail thin - looks my way . I think he sees me . Click , click , click . Having burned through a roll of film , I furiously load another . There 's really nothing more to shoot , and yet I keep firing away . I 'm late for work , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave . Wait ! My head snaps back to the gurneys as something catches my eye . At first , I ca n't believe it . Maybe it 's the wind , or just my mind playing tricks early in the morning . Then it happens again , and I gasp . The last body bag ... it moved ! Did I just see what I think I saw ? I 'm terrified and want to run away . Instead , I edge even closer . Instinct ? Undertow ? I 'm staring at that zipped-up body bag , and all I know is that there 's been a horrible mistake by the police or the EMS . The zipper ! It 's creeping backward . That body bag is opening from the inside ! My eyes bulge , and my knees buckle . Literally . I stagger through the crowd , staring through my lens in shock and disbelief . I see a finger emerge , then an entire hand . Oh , God , and there 's blood ! " Help ! " I scream , lowering my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd turns , the cops and paramedics too . They glance at me and scoff in disbelief or reproach , shaking their heads as if I just escaped from Bellevue . They think I 'm nuts ! I stab the air , pointing at the body bag as the hand pushes through the plastic , desperately reaching out for help . I think it 's a woman 's hand . Do something , Kris ! You have to save her ! I raise my camera again , and - Chapter Two I JOLT UP SO FAST I nearly break my neck . I 'm drenched with sweat , crying hysterically , and have no idea where I am . Everything is blurry , so I try to rub my eyes into focus , but it 's hard because my hands are trembling out of control . Actually , my whole body is trembling . I plead with myself , C'm on , Kris . Finally , shapes begin to appear before me , followed by outlines ... and , like a Polaroid , it all becomes clear . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collapsing back into my pillow , I let out the world 's hugest sigh of relief . Never have I been so happy to be alone in my own bed . But it was so real . The body bags ... a woman 's hand coming out of one of them . I turn to my alarm clock - a little before six a.m . Good , I can still get a few more minutes of sleep . But the moment I close my eyes , they pop right open again . I hear something , a pounding , and it 's not just my stressed-out heart . Someone 's at the door . Throwing on the same blue terry cloth robe I 've had since my Boston College days , I trudge across my tiny apartment , which is decorated with the very finest furnishings from the Crate &; Barrel factory-reject sale . So what if my couch has only three legs and belongs in a Farrelly brothers movie ? The pounding gets louder . More urgent and annoying . All right already , hold your horses ! Approaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . That 's what peepholes are for , especially in Manhattan . Quietly , I lean forward and squint to look with a tired eye . Shit . Her . I open the door . Glaring at me through a pair of drugstore bifocals is my nosy old neighbor from down the hall , Mrs. Rosencrantz . She 's clearly ticked off about something , and that makes two of us . " Do you realize what time it is ? " I grumble . " Do you realize what time it is ? " she shoots back . " Once and for all , you 've got to stop this psychotic screaming every morning . " I look at Mrs. Rosencrantz - all four feet ten of her - as if she 's the one who 's psychotic . I may have been crying , but I certainly was n't screaming . " You know , if you really want to hassle someone about noise , Mrs. Rosencrantz , you should find out who 's playing that music at six a.m . " She gives me a sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't hear that ? It 's coming from ... " I step into the hallway , turning my head left and right . Wait - where exactly is it coming from ? Mrs. Rosencrantz shakes her head and huffs . " I do n't hear any music , Ms. Burns . And if you 're trying to be a little smartass with me , I 'm telling you right now I do n't appreciate it . " " Mrs. Rosencrantz , I 'm not trying to - " She cuts me off . " Do n't think I ca n't get you evicted , because I can . " I frown at the old bat , who happens to look even more unpleasant and haggard than usual , if that 's possible . You want smart-ass , lady ? I 'll give you smart-ass ! " Mrs. Rosencrantz , I 'm going back to bed now ... and if you do n't mind my saying so , you could use a little more beauty sleep yourself . " With that , I promptly close the door on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a beeline for my bed , when I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror by the coat closet . Whoa ! I 'm sporting some serious raccoon eyes and a pretty spectacular case of bedhead . Omigod , I look almost as bad as Mrs. Rosencrantz ! Supposedly , I have this killer wink that everybody loves . I wink at myself in the mirror . It does n't help . I wink at myself again . Nope , nothing . I laugh out loud , and for a moment , I forget about the horrible dream and my neighbor from hell . But only for a moment . Because I still ca n't figure out the music and where it 's coming from . Walking around my apartment like Elmer Fudd hunting rabbits , I press my ear against the walls . Feeling totally ridiculous , I drop to my knees and try listening through the floorboards . Only after grabbing a chair to climb closer to the ceiling do I realize what 's going on . The music is n't coming from anywhere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT GOOD ! I stand perfectly still in my living room and try to listen ... between my ears . The music is faint , but it 's definitely there . How bizarre is this ? How scary ? What a weird , weird morning this has been , and I 've barely been out of bed five minutes . I close my eyes . It 's a song , and it sounds familiar . I 've definitely heard it before . For the life of me , though , I ca n't put my finger on it . Just keep quiet and keep listening , I tell myself . But in the next second , I can do neither , as the silence in my apartment is upended by the phone ringing . It 's okay , though . It 's always okay when he calls . " Hello ? " " Good morning , sweetheart , " Michael whispers , " this is your phone sex wake-up call . " I 've heard him say the line a hundred times and still I giggle . " Good morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How did you sleep , Kris ? " " Do n't ask . " " Why ? What 's wrong ? " " I had this horrible , horrible dream , and to top it off , my crackpot neighbor just pounded on my door and flipped out on me . " " Let me guess , " he says . " It 's that nasty old lady from down the hall . The one out of Rosemary 's Baby . " " Bingo . The woman 's got one foot in the grave and the other in her mouth . I swear , the things she says , she 's going to drive me crazy . " Maybe she has already . " Even more of a reason to move , Kris . " " I knew you were going to say that . " " The offer still stands . It 's only what you deserve . " " I told you , Michael , I do n't want you getting me a new place . I need to do it myself . I will . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be a star . Are n't I ? " " Of course you are . But you 're so stubborn sometimes . " " That 's what you love about me . " " You 're right , " he says . " The fact that you 're smart , talented , and gorgeous has nothing to do with it . " God , how I love him . He 's such a sweetheart ! Mind you , it does n't hurt that he 's also handsome , athletic , and a managing partner at Baer Stevens Asset Management . Michael could buy me ten new apartments without batting an eyelash . " So , are you already at the office ? " I ask . " Of course . Either you eat the Baer Stevens , or the Baer Stevens - " I chuckle . The sun 's barely up . " I do n't know how you do it . " " Clean living , that 's how . " " Ha . " " Speaking of doing it , though ... " " Very funny , lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy me dinner first . " " Damn , I wish I could , except I 've got to wine and dine some important clients in town for the night . Business before pleasure , as they say . What about after dinner ? You could be my dessert . Yum . " " We 'll just see about yum . " Of course , Michael knows that 's as good as a yes with me . All I really want to do is my photography and be with him , my almost perfect man . " Now tell me , " I say . His voice drops to a whisper again . " I love you , Kristin . I adore you . I ca n't live without you . " " And I love you , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . I do , Michael . " He sighs . " Such music to my ears . You really do love me , do n't you ? " I do n't respond . I ca n't . The word has me momentarily frozen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I no longer hear the song in my head . What a relief ! I 'm not losing my mind after all . " Kristin , you there ? " he asks . For a split second , I consider telling him about the music . I do n't , though . It 's a little too flaky . " Yeah , I 'm here , " I say . " You okay ? " " I 'm fine - sorry , I was just checking the time . Do n't want to be late for work . " " You 're right , " he says . " I 'll let you go . Lord knows you do n't want to piss off that boss of yours . " (
