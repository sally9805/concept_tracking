A Gathering Chicago One sunny Sunday in Chicago , several former classmates , who were good friends in school , gathered for lunch , having attended their high school reunion the night before . They wanted to hear more about what was happening in each other 's lives . After a good deal of kidding , and a good meal , they settled into an interesting conversation . Angela , who had been one of the most popular people in the class , said , " Life sure turned out differently than I thought it would when we were in school . A lot has changed . " " It certainly has , " Nathan echoed . They knew he had gone into his family 's business , which had operated pretty much the same and had been a part of the local community for as long as they could remember . So , they were surprised when he seemed concerned . He asked , " But , have you noticed how we do n't want to change when things change ? " Carlos said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . " " Carlos , you were Captain of the football team , " Jessica said . " I never thought I 'd hear you say anything about being afraid ! " They all laughed as they realized that although they had gone off in different directionsfrom working at home to managing companiesthey were experiencing similar feelings . Everyone was trying to cope with the unexpected changes that were happening to them in recent years . And most admitted that they did not know a good way to handle them . Then Michael said , " I used to be afraid of change . When a big change came along in our business , we did n't know what to do . So we did n't adjust and we almost lost it . " That is , " he continued , " until I heard a funny little story that changed everything . " " How so ? " Nathan asked . " Well , the story changed the way I looked at changefrom losing something to gaining somethingand it showed me how to do it . After that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first I was annoyed with the obvious simplicity of the story because it sounded like something we might have been told in school . " Then I realized I was really annoyed with myself for not seeing the obvious and doing what works when things change . " When I realized the four characters in the story represented the various parts of myself , I decided who I wanted to act like and I changed . " Later , I passed the story on to some people in our company and they passed it on to others , and soon our business did much better , because most of us adapted to change better . And like me , many people said it helped them in their personal lives . " However there were a few people who said they got nothing out of it . They either knew the lessons and were already living them , or , more commonly , they thought they already knew everything and did n't want to learn . They could n't see why so many others were benefiting from it . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting , said the story was a waste of his time , other people kidded him saying they knew which character he was in the storymeaning the one who learned nothing new and did not change . " " What 's the story ? " Angela asked . " It 's called Who Moved My Cheese ? " The group laughed . " I think I like it already , " Carlos said . " Would you tell us the story ? Maybe we can get something from it . " " Sure , " Michael replied . " I 'd be happy toit does n't take long . " And so he began : The Story of Who Moved My Cheese ? Once , long ago in a land far away , there lived four little characters who ran through a maze looking for cheese to nourish them and make them happy . Two were mice named " Sniff " and " Scurry " and two were littlepeoplebeings who were as small as mice but who looked and acted a lot like people today . Their names were " Hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , it would be easy not to notice what the four of them were doing . But if you looked closely enough , you could discover the most amazing things ! Every day the mice and the littlepeople spent time in the maze looking for their own special cheese . The mice , Sniff and Scurry , possessing only simple rodent brains , but good instincts , searched for the hard nibbling cheese they liked , as mice often do . The two littlepeople , Hem and Haw , used their brains , filled with many beliefs and emotions , to search for a very different kind of Cheesewith a capital Cwhich they believed would make them feel happy and successful . As different as the mice and littlepeople were , they shared something in common : Every morning , they each put on their jogging suits and running shoes , left their little homes , and raced out into the maze looking for their favorite cheese . The maze was a labyrinth of corridors and chambers , some containing delicious cheese . But there were also dark corners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone to get lost . However , for those who found their way , the maze held secrets that let them enjoy a better life . The mice , Sniff and Scurry , used the simple trial-and-error method of finding cheese . They ran down one corridor , and if it proved empty , they turned and ran down another . They remembered the corridors that held no cheese and quickly went into new areas . Sniff would smell out the general direction of the cheese , using his great nose , and Scurry would race ahead . They got lost , as you might expect , went off in the wrong direction and often bumped into walls . But after a while they found their way . Like the mice , the two littlepeople , Hem and Haw , also used their ability to think and learn from their past experiences . However , they relied on their complex brains to develop more sophisticated methods of finding Cheese . Sometimes they did well , but at other times their powerful human beliefs and emotions took over and clouded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maze more complicated and challenging . Nonetheless , Sniff , Scurry , Hem and Haw all discovered , in their own way , what they were looking for . They each found their own kind of cheese one day at the end of one of the corridors in Cheese Station C. Every morning after that , the mice and the littlepeople dressed in their running gear and headed over to Cheese Station C. It was n't long before they each established their own routine . Sniff and Scurry continued to wake early every day and race through the maze , always following the same route . When they arrived at their destination , the mice took off their running shoes , tied them together and hung them around their necksso they could get to them quickly whenever they needed them again . Then they enjoyed the cheese . In the beginning Hem and Haw also raced toward Cheese Station C every morning to enjoy the tasty new morsels that awaited them . But after a while , a different routine set in for the littlepeople . Hem and Haw awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and walked to Cheese Station C. After all , they knew where the Cheese was now and how to get there . They had no idea where the Cheese came from , or who put it there . They just assumed it would be there . As soon as Hem and Haw arrived at Cheese Station C each morning , they settled in and made themselves at home . They hung up their jogging suits , put away their running shoes and put on their slippers . They were becoming very comfortable now that they had found the Cheese . " This is great , " Hem said . " There 's enough Cheese here to last us forever . " The littlepeople felt happy and successful , and thought they were now secure . It was n't long before Hem and Haw regarded the Cheese they found at Cheese Station C as their cheese . It was such a large store of Cheese that they eventually moved their homes to be closer to it , and built a social life around it . To make themselves feel more at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even drew pictures of Cheese around them which made them smile . One read : Having Cheese Makes You Happy . Sometimes Hem and Haw would take their friends by to see their pile of Cheese at Cheese Station C , and point to it with pride , saying , " Pretty nice Cheese , huh ? " Sometimes they shared it with their friends and sometimes they did n't . " We deserve this Cheese , " Hem said . " We certainly had to work long and hard enough to find it . " He picked up a nice fresh piece and ate it . Afterwards , Hem fell asleep , as he often did . Every night the littlepeople would waddle home , full of Cheese , and every morning they would confidently return for more . This went on for quite some time . After a while Hem 's and Haw 's confidence grew into the arrogance of success . Soon they became so comfortable they did n't even notice what was happening . As time went on , Sniff and Scurry continued their routine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scurried around Cheese Station C , inspecting the area to see if there had been any changes from the day before . Then they would sit down to nibble on the cheese . One morning they arrived at Cheese Station C and discovered there was no cheese . They were n't surprised . Since Sniff and Scurry had noticed the supply of cheese had been getting smaller every day , they were prepared for the inevitable and knew instinctively what to do . They looked at each other , removed the running shoes they had tied together and hung conveniently around their necks , put them on their feet and laced them up . The mice did not overanalyze things . To the mice , the problem and the answer were both simple . The situation at Cheese Station C had changed . So , Sniff and Scurry decided to change . They both looked out into the maze . Then Sniff lifted his nose , sniffed , and nodded to Scurry , who took off running through the maze , while Sniff followed as fast as he could . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same day , Hem and Haw arrived at Cheese Station C. They had not been paying attention to the small changes that had been taking place each day , so they took it for granted their Cheese would be there . They were unprepared for what they found . " What ! No Cheese ? " Hem yelled . He continued yelling , " No Cheese ? No Cheese ? " as though if he shouted loud enough someone would put it back . " Who moved my Cheese ? " he hollered . Finally , he put his hands on his hips , his face turned red , and he screamed at the top of his voice , " It 's not fair ! " Haw just shook his head in disbelief . He , too , had counted on finding Cheese at Cheese Station C. He stood there for a long time , frozen with shock . He was just not ready for this . Hem was yelling something , but Haw did n't want to hear it . He did n't want to deal with what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The littlepeople 's behavior was not very attractive or productive but it was understandable . Finding Cheese was n't easy , and it meant a great deal more to the littlepeople than just having enough of it to eat every day . Finding Cheese was the littlepeople 's way of getting what they thought they needed to be happy . They had their own ideas of what Cheese meant to them , depending on their taste . For some , finding Cheese was having material things . For others it was enjoying good health , or developing a spiritual sense of well-being . For Haw , Cheese just meant feeling safe , having a loving family someday , and living in a cozy cottage on Cheddar Lane . To Hem , Cheese was becoming A Big Cheese in charge of others and owning a big house atop Camembert Hill . Because Cheese was important to them , the two littlepeople spent a long time trying to decide what to do . All they could think of was to keep looking around Cheeseless Station C to see if the Cheese was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hem and Haw continued to hem and haw . They ranted and raved at the injustice of it all . Haw started to get depressed . What would happen if the Cheese was n't there tomorrow ? He had made future plans based on this Cheese . The littlepeople could n't believe it . How could this have happened ? No one had warned them . It was n't right . It was not the way things were supposed to be . Hem and Haw went home that night hungry and discouraged . But before they left , Haw wrote on the wall : The More Important Your Cheese Is To You The More You Want To Hold On To It .
