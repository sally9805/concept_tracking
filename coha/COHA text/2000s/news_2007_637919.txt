<p> These days , only the most fortunate among us can count on a traditional pension to ensure a comfortable retirement . Which is why most people who want to be able to afford to retire need to pack as much money as they can into their 401(k) accounts . <p> Problem is , few of us feel we have the time , energy or expertise to manage our 401(k)s well . Even if we invest properly , for example , we often neglect to fine-tune our accounts to reflect new life circumstances or a portfolio that 's fallen out of balance . <p> " Too many workers set up their 401(k) plan and then just forget about it , " says Glenn Kautt , a financial planner in Fairfax , Va . <p> Such errors can imperil our prospects for a secure retirement . Here are five of the most common mistakes we make with our 401(k) accounts : <p> 1 Rejecting free money <p> Many workers contribute too little to their 401(k) plan to take advantage of their employer 's match  --  typically 50 cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the most glaring mistake that people make , " says Lydia Sheckels , a financial planner at Philadelphia-based Wescott Financial Advisory Group . " They will drive 100 miles to save $5 on an item , but they do n't take advantage of money that is right under their nose . " <p> Some do invest enough to receive a portion of the company match  --  but not enough to enjoy the maximum match . Investing just a little more money , Kautt notes , would earn them an instant , no-risk return . <p> One positive sign is that some employers are boosting their 401(k) match . Mercer Human Resource Consulting found that 36% of plans offered a 100% match in 2006 , up from 26% of plans in 2002 . <p> Another is that more young people are taking advantage of 401(k) plans , thanks to employers that are increasingly adopting automatic enrollment for new workers . Still , one-third of employees of companies with 401(k) plans fail to participate at all , according to a 2006 study by Hewitt Associates . <p> 2 Loading up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of Enron employees of their retirement money , should have dramatically taught the rest of us the perils of investing too heavily in our company 's stock . A well-diversified portfolio is your smartest bet . Yet company stock has continued to make up the single-largest holding for employees in 401(k) plans that offer it , according to Hewitt 's report . <p> At least the percentage of employees who held half or more of their portfolio in company stock declined , to 20% , from 27% in 2004 , Hewitt found . Some experts suggest that workers avoid company stock altogether . But employers often make it difficult , by making their matching contribution only in company stock ( though employees can later shift that money into other investment options ) . <p> Whatever the case , most experts say that company stock  --  no matter how highflying your company 's prospects seem  --  should n't make up more than 10% of your 401(k) account . <p> " If the company goes under or does poorly , you not only may be losing a huge portion of your retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your job , " says Jack VanDerhei of the Employee Benefit Research Institute ( EBRI ) and a professor at Temple University . Given the many options to diversify a 401(k) account , there 's no reason to bet heavily on one stock . <p> 3 Chasing performance <p> Too often , 401(k) investors grab too recklessly at the mutual funds in their plans with the hottest recent performances . " That is one of the most common mistakes , " says Russel Kinnel , director of mutual fund research at Morningstar . <p> Many of us , Kinnel says , simply look at fund returns for the past year , go to our 401(k) options , uncheck the box next to the fund that fared the worst and shift money to the fund that did the best . But a sizzling recent performance is hardly a guarantee that a fund will continue to outperform others . It 's generally not a wise investment strategy . <p> " You see a lot of failed efforts to time the market , " Sheckels says . " This happens more often in 401(k) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes ( when they sell fund shares inside the account ) , so it 's easy to hit the switch . " Selling fund shares outside a retirement account will usually trigger capital gains taxes . <p> A wiser strategy is to make sure you have a sound investment plan based on your age and risk tolerance , with a diversified portfolio of several funds with solid long-term performance records . <p> 4 Investing too conservatively <p> Another investment error is the opposite of being reckless : being too cautious . That 's especially a concern when young or midcareer workers , who have many years before they will retire , invest too little of their 401(k) portfolio in stock funds . <p> In fact , 18.5% of workers in their 20s had no stock investments in their 401(k) portfolios , according to a 2006 study by EBRI . And 13.3% of workers in their 30s owned no stocks . <p> " When you 're in your 20s and 30s , and you have decades left for your investment horizon , you should be able to weather any annual volatility at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to invest significantly in stock funds at that point , he says , you might not end up with enough money for a comfortable retirement . <p> Even workers who are close to retirement age are sometimes too quick to switch out of stock funds . Given that their retirements might last 30 years , they should consider carefully before investing too heavily in cash or bond funds . <p> If you have a long-term horizon , you should maintain a well-balanced portfolio that includes an assortment of investments , Sheckels suggests . <p> 5 Failing to fine-tune <p> Too few workers reassess their retirement plan at least once a year . It 's more common for workers to direct their savings into a few funds and then seldom , or never , look at them again . It 's not something you need to do too often , but you should at least do the annual checkup . <p> Your goal is to make sure that your entire retirement portfolio , including stocks , bonds and cash , still reflect an appropriate investment allocation . If one mutual fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be time to rebalance your investments . <p> Many employees feel they do n't have the time or the knowledge to invest properly . " But this is n't rocket science , " Kautt says . " You can read the descriptions that are on the websites . They 're written in English , and they make sense , and you can figure out what to do . " <p> If you still need help , many employers now offer investment advice . <p> " When 401(k)s were created , the employers were wary of providing advice because they did n't want to be on the hook if there was a bear market , " Kinnel says . <p> But last year , Congress enacted a pension law that 's made it easier to automatically enroll workers and eased rules that had limited investment advice . Now , mutual fund companies and other third parties are freer to provide investment recommendations . <p> If your 401(k) plan does n't offer good investment advice , it does n't mean you have to go it alone . Considering the importance of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment adviser . In the long run , it could be worth it . <p> How the different generations invest <p> Baby boomers <p> They are more likely to participate in their 401(k) plan and to contribute at greater levels than younger employees are . <p> Still , more than one-quarter of boomers ( which a study by Hewitt Associates defined as those ages 42 to 59 ) fail to invest in a 401(k) plan if their employer offers one . More than two-thirds of them cite day-to-day expenses as one reason they do n't contribute . And nearly half say that saving for emergencies gets in the way of retirement saving . <p> Generation X <p> More than one-third of Generation Xers ( defined as ages 26 to 41 ) are n't saving in their 401(k) plan if one is available . Even among those who do save , the contributions are lower than for baby boomers . But Gen Xers are more likely than younger workers to admit that they are n't saving enough . <p> They are also more likely than any other generation to say that saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with retirement savings . Saving for a home purchase is another reason . <p> Generation Y <p> Only 31% of Generation Y employees ( ages 18 to 25 ) participate in a 401(k) plan if it 's provided . On average , they contribute just 5.6% of their pay , which is generally less than the amount needed to receive a typical full company match of 50 cents on the dollar , up to 6% of pay . <p> Generation Y workers most commonly say day-to-day needs and lifestyle purchases create obstacles to retirement saving . And more than others , they say they put off saving because they believe they have more important goals . <p> Source : " Three Generations Prepare for Retirement , " February 2006 , Hewitt Associates
