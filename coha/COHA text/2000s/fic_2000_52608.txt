In August , the summer after her ninth-grade year , the girl  --  pudgy , moonfaced , with dull brown hair and new breasts  --  met the man who became her first husband . Before that , she 'd been seeing a tall boy she danced with at junior high graduation , starting with a concentric-circle wheel-dance the chaperons employed to pull the boys and girls from their sniggering packs and make them sway clumsily with one another , parodies of the men and women you see cracking wise on the color TV . After the dance , screened from view by a dumpster , the tall boy kissed the girl . She 'd kissed boys before , here and there , no one special . It was the tall boy 's first kiss . He was afraid he 'd be caught and made fun of . He would grow up and write for TV ; she was already grown . <p> The tall boy was from the west side of their town , the oldest son of unpious Presbyterians who owned a clothing store and a brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist , with black people as neighbors . In the center was a courthouse and actual train tracks . She thought she loved the tall boy ( she never said so ) . She wrote songs about him on her grandmother 's guitar , songs she did n't let anyone hear . She 'd never been in his house , met his parents , or been shown off to his friends . When she came to watch his swimming meets , he did n't talk to her . The day before the tall boy left town for a family vacation , a three-week trip to Disneyland and other attractions in and around Anaheim , California , he called her from a rotary phone in his basement and said it was over . <p> " I wo n't let you , " she said . " You ca n't break up with me unless I let you , and I wo n't . " <p> The tall boy stammered that this was n't how it worked . " Look , if I start going out with someone else ... , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the girl . " I 'll forgive you . " She had her blue shirttail balled up in the white knuckles of her fist . A song she liked was on the radio , one about a stubborn woman who pushed through betrayal and loss to find true love . " No matter what you say or what you do , " she said , " we 're still going together , you and me . " <p> The tall boy said no they were not and hung up . He and his family left for California in their Pontiac Silhouette minivan . The girl went to the BP station , bought a folding roadmap of America , and found Anaheim , California . She herself had been no farther west than Fort Wayne , Indiana , which was an hour away . She 'd been as far east as Cleveland ( once , she and her mom took a Greyhound there to see Art , her mom 's dad ; they ate at a Ruby Tuesday 's in a mall ; her mom and Art argued , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl never even saw downtown Cleveland , unless a glimpse of the distant gray spires of the Society Building and Terminal Tower counts ) . She 'd been as far south as Gatlinburg , Tennessee , and Great Smoky Mountain National Park ( once ) . She 'd been as far north as the party store just over the Michigan line where they sold warm canned beer to anybody . She took a ruler and an ink pen and connected those four points on the map . Then she drew some angled lines , shading in the quadrilateral . She refolded the map and hid it under her mattress . By her math it was 2,448 miles to Anaheim . <p> Two days later at Sunday church , she played and sang " Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam " on her grandmother 's guitar . After the service , in the fellowship hall , a man came up and said she 'd moved him . He was a friend of a cousin of her mom 's . He drove a white Ford truck with boards in back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men women sang about on country-music radio . He lived in an even smaller town , thirteen miles east . He worked in a Chinese-food factory there and had his own apartment , up over someone 's garage . Their first date was a movie with Bruce Willis in it . Afterward , the man took her to a diner with a big revolving coffee cup on the sign , bought her pie , and showed her off to his friends . He said he was going to grow a mustache like the one Bruce Willis had in that movie . His hair already did look a lot like Bruce Willis 's toupee , only it was n't a toupee and needed a cut . He smelled like Aqua Velva aftershave . He wore brown Dingo boots . <p> One night when the girl 's mom came home from the dinner shift at Pizza Hut , the girl lay on the couch , with her top and bra pulled up , her shorts and her underpants tangled at her ankles . The man had his T-shirt off , his oily jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mom cleared her throat . If they agreed to speak with Minister Steve , she said , she would not punish the girl . In the minister 's mayonnaise-smelling office , the man was moved by the Holy Spirit , or so he said , and proposed to the girl . She thought this was ridiculous , but could n't say so in front of Minister Steve , who kept looking on , nosy and pleased with himself . She said yes . It gave her a thrill to do a bad thing that Minister Steve , her mom , and all her mom 's people would think was good . She could have relations all she wanted , and nobody could say anything . The next week , before that mustache filled in enough to show in the pictures , they were married . Her ring was a band of pure silver . <p> The wedding was small and in the little white Baptist church , the only one in the county . Her much older half-sister , Janelle , took the photos , using a succession of disposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of his people lived in southern Indiana and could n't afford the trip . No one knew how to get hold of the girl 's father . Her mom , citing tradition , refused to give her away . That role was played by the organist 's surprised husband , who did n't even have long pants on . Shorts , dark socks . The girl was n't stupid . She understood how this looked . But she held her head high and walked down the aisle with her eyes on the mural of the crucified Jesus . Please , she thought . Please . <p> The reception was held under the deluxe aluminum awning of the cousin 's doublewide , in the town 's nicest trailer court , which happened to be owned by the tall boy 's grandfather . ( If you enjoy meanwhiles , picture the tall boy riding It 's a Small World , fighting with his little brother , Todd , and not thinking about the girl . ) The man had told the girl they 'd have their honeymoon in the new Ramada Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he said it was booked . They 'd be staying across the road at the Seashell Motel , which was thousands of miles from any sea . The only time she 'd ever been in a motel was that trip to Gatlinburg and the Great Smoky Mountains , when she , Janelle , her mom , and Janelle 's daddy ( Mr. Dixon , who was back in the picture there for a while ) all piled into one room with a king-size bed in a newly remodeled Knight 's Inn in Pigeon Forge , Tennessee . <p> The man parked his truck by their door . He carried in the luggage : hers , an old mint-green piece of hard-sided Samsonite ; his , two plastic bags from Kroger 's , one with clothes , the other full of sixteen-ounce cans of Bud Light beer . She stood at the threshold , dressed in new beige slacks and a matching knit blouse . She fingered her ring . " Oh , Mr. Man ? " she said . " You forget something ? " <p> The man already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt unbuttoned , and was sprawled on the threadbare chenille bedspread , sipping beer and watching the Detroit Tigers play baseball . He moaned and mentioned a bad back that she had n't known about , painkillers he had n't told her he was on . But as he begged off , he called her baby . She smiled , let herself in , and locked the door behind her . <p> The place had been built in a time when Formica was dark and plentiful . There was no telephone . The curtains had Southern belles and mansions on them . The air-conditioning was a dripping window unit . Over the bed hung a big-framed piece of cardboard with painted seashells glued to it in the shape of Indian chief head . The room was clean . The girl dragged her suitcase into the bathroom and put the hook in the eye to lock the door . She faced the mirror . She stared into her own eyes as she took off her clothes , applied perfumes and powders and ointments , and decided to leave in the side pouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get and that the girl had been humiliated to be fitted for . She was married . God would provide . <p> She began to cry , though not so loud as to be heard over the sound of the TV and A/C . The girl rarely cried . She 'd cried the day after her daddy came into her room one night smelling of whiskey and stood silent and still at the foot of her bed for a long time . She felt a menace she could not name or anticipate , though all that happened was that he finished his drink and left the empty glass on her dresser and got into that Camaro he was so proud of and left town to take a job with a company that did door-to-door baby photos , or so his letter said . The girl was only six then . When she read that letter , that 's when she cried . Long sobs that hurt her ribcage . He did n't say where the company was located , and neither the girl nor her mom had heard from him since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry anymore . Even last year when her grandmother died  --  the woman who cooked for her , watched her after school , and taught her how to play guitar  --  the girl did n't cry . Even now , in the bathroom at the Seashell Motel , where many women before her had looked into that small mirror and cried , she did n't cry for too awful long . She fixed her makeup , slipped into the pink nightgown her half-sister had lent her , unhooked the door , and saw the man asleep on the bed . <p> " Baby ? " she said . " Hey , baby . " She turned off the TV set , which woke him up . <p> " Hey , " he said . " I was watching that . " Then he caught sight of her and said , " Whoa . " <p> The curtains were open . She did n't have the nerve to close them , because of what that meant , but she did n't want to leave them open , because someone walking by might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked as babies . The man pinned her to the bedspread , did n't even pull down the covers , and the bristles of his thin mustache scratched her lips . Down there he was hard , jabbing , grunting from his failure . The girl had thought she knew what to do , but she could n't move and could n't find any words . She closed her eyes . She asked Jesus to make this turn out okay , to help her husband thrust himself inside her , fill her with his seed , so she might know the joys of married love . <p> Abruptly , the man , her husband , threw himself on his back and said an ugly word . He 'd gone soft . He cupped his hand around the back of her head , lifted it up , and pressed it down his chest and his stomach to where he wanted it . She opened her mouth and received him . He kept his hand planted on the back of her head , fingers twined in her dull hair , and she performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . After , he went to sleep . Darkness fell . With the taste of him still in her mouth , she curled up against him , shivering , still atop the bedspread . She kept meaning to get up and close the curtains , but she did n't want to wake him . She did not sleep . At dawn , he awoke , went to the bathroom , came back to bed without brushing his teeth , climbed on her , and they just could n't . This simple human act , and they could n't manage to fit themselves together . The girl blamed herself and satisfied her husband again the only way she could think of . Again he fell asleep . Later that morning , he woke up , got dressed , said he 'd be right back , and left . She got under the covers . Still she was shivering . He came back with a big jar of Vaseline . He stripped , pulled back the sheets , took a fist-size dollop of Vaseline , and slathered it over her and inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poked at her it worked . She could hardly feel him , for all the Vaseline . Only the weight of this grimacing , wiry man on top of her . This stranger , her husband . She looked up at the water stains on the ceiling , looking for Jesus ' face or any sort of sign . Then her husband yelled as if he 'd been shot and for some reason pulled himself out of her and wrapped his hand around his own penis , pumping it madly while his seed dribbled out , gray pearls that fell onto the adorable paunch of her stomach . <p> Outside , there was applause and male and female laughter . Someone had seen ! Her husband stood up , shouted more ugly words , and yanked closed the curtains . Car doors slammed . <p> " I love you , " the girl whispered . She blinked back tears . For a long time the man was quiet . Finally he said , " Back atcha , baby doll . " He got her a wet washcloth so she could clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color TV to a game show , and sat there shouting out wrong answers . <p> They barely touched or talked . They did n't even eat until late that afternoon , when they showered and got dressed and walked over to the Ramada Inn . <p> " I 'm so sorry . " He reached his hand across the table . " I 'm not as ... , " he said . " I mean , I know you wanted me to teach you , but ... " He looked across the restaurant , as if the sneezeguard at the salad bar were the most interesting thing ever . <p> The girl squeezed her husband 's hand . " It 's okay , " she said . " Everything will be all right . " <p> He did not look at her . <p> " But can I tell you something ? " Finally , he looked at her . In a whisper , she scrunched her nose and said she did n't like it , that Vaseline . She could n't wash it completely off . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's do it naturally . " She tried to smile . " We 'll learn , together , how to be man and wife , the way God intended . " <p> All the man could do was nod . <p> When the waitress came he said they 'd both have the all-you-care-to-eat chicken . Afterward , he was shocked at the size of the bill . He was the one who 'd ordered four four-dollar Heineken beers . The girl just had water . " Here 's the first secret I 'm telling you , man to wife , " he said , getting up to pay . " They were n't booked up here . It just cost too much . " He shrugged . " Hope you understand . " <p> " I do , " she said , for the second time in two days . She did n't mean it . <p> They spent another night and day at the Seashell Motel . The more she got to know him , the more he seemed like a stranger . Nothing got better . He lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud Light beer . Her jaw muscles burned with pain . Right before they checked out , he climbed onto her and tried again , and again it did n't work , and he raised his fist and looked like he was going to punch her . He did n't punch her . He stopped himself . He slapped himself on the top of his head , again and again and again . <p> All she said was , " We 're through . " She knew from watching talk shows that if he raised the fist once , he 'd raise it again , and eventually when he lowered it , it would not be his own head he was hitting . She did not cry . <p> The man , her husband , begged for mercy . Broke into tears and swore it would never happen again . After more of this than she 'd have thought he had in him , she relented . They were charged extra for late checkout , which was all the man could talk about on their drive to his apartment , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things  --  clothes , AM-FM radio , and the guitar  --  and left them sitting on the wooden steps to the apartment . Fortunately it had not rained . Under her breath the girl praised God for small mercies . <p> This time the girl did not stand waiting at the threshold . She went inside first . She took out the guitar , and rubbed its warm , battered wood , and sat on a beer-smelling couch , and stared out the window at the main house , where the landlords , she hoped , had nice lives . The phone rang . The man answered . Sure , he said , give him five minutes . He kissed her goodbye with his scratchy mouth closed and left to go meet the boys . She watched his truck disappear around the corner . She tried to write a song , but the words would n't happen . Even when she tried singing old songs her grandmother had taught her , the girl kept forgetting the lyrics . She kept thinking of the fist the man , her husband , raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even hymns . <p> By the time she and the man had failed at love so often they gave up trying and the man had raised his fist once more ( though still not hit her ) and the girl had canceled her appointment at the doctor 's to see what might be wrong with her and instead packed her things , left her wedding ring on top of the TV , and got a ride to her mom 's house from her older half-sister , Janelle , and her mom called Minister Steve to see if it was possible to get an annulment but he said sorry , once does count-by then , the girl had missed the first two months of the tenth grade . <p> She reenrolled under her new name , was given a locker surrounded by seniors , and found herself in classes with " general " in the title . The tall boy had a locker among the other sophomores and was taking college-prep everything . Once in a while they 'd make eye contact in the hall . He never said anything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing him was like opening a dresser drawer and finding a dear , forgotten toy  --  broken , useless , still there . <p> She worked hard to catch up . One teacher told her to find a study partner , but her old girlfriends treated her like bad marriage was a virus they could catch from her . Another teacher told her to bear down ; high school was a new world , more complicated than junior high . A time when you learn that everything you knew is wrong . She heard this and shook her head . She could teach these teachers some things . <p> At night she sat in her mom 's house with the kitchen and TV  --  room TVs both on , gnawing ink pens and staring at the route Magellan took around the world or at story problems starring people with names like Jacinto , LaShawnda , and Emiko . She could n't keep her mind on it . She kept waiting for the man , her husband , to beg her to come home . To say they needed to talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never stopped by . Sometime that fall , according to the girl 's mom 's cousin , he was a no-show at the Chinese-food factory , his things were gone from his apartment over the garage , and that was all anyone knew . Southern Indiana , the girl guessed , where his people were . She took out that BP roadmap . How many trips to , say , the package store right over the Michigan line does it take to equal a trip to let 's just say Evansville , Indiana ? She never got story problems like this , ones that seemed worth the trouble . Her attention strayed to the TV . Her favorites were the reality shows : rescues , mysteries , heroes , funny videos . She disliked comedies , all those fake , pretty people in fake , faraway cities like New York , Los Angeles , Seattle , and even Cleveland . Her mom made them watch doctor shows , lawyer shows , and , worst of all , those shows where everyone is in high school forever . Luckily her mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , walking home from school , a warm day for early winter , the girl ran into the tall boy coming out of the library . Who knew why , but he said hello , she said hello back , he asked if it 'd be okay to walk her home , and she said sure , why not ? They talked about the school basketball team and the tall boy 's fastest swimming times and what music he hated on the radio ( nearly all of it ) . When they got to her house she asked if the tall boy would like to know what had happened to her . He said he thought he sort of knew . Her new name gave it away . <p> " Well , I 'm getting it annulled , " she said , which was still a possibility . Her mom was arguing that man 's law is not God 's law and that once did n't have to count , that the girl should go to court and forget about that once . " It 's different from divorced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> At that word , marriage , the tall boy flinched . <p> But he followed her into her house . They drank Kroger's-brand cola and talked about small things . When he thought he needed to get home for dinner , he stopped at the door and turned around . She was right behind him . They kissed . She watched him run home . When she saw him actually jump up in the air and kick up his heels , she laughed . <p> They started seeing each other again , more on the sly than ever . They 'd meet at her house , under the crumbling bleachers at Park Stadium , and in groves of pine trees on the edge of town . Sometimes he wrote papers for her or did her math , careful to do C work  --  though , really , who 'd have suspected ? No one from the tall boy 's life seemed to know the girl existed . Plus , by now , the schoolwork the girl did on her own had improved . But the secret kissing and groping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not it . The boy was n't even pushing for it . They ground their clothed bodies together . The tall boy slipped his clammy hands under the girl 's ill-fitting bras . At most , he put his finger inside her and , with rank ineptitude , tried to pleasure her ; she would let him know , sometimes , that this was sinful . She reached inside his jeans and grabbed him through his underwear and made him come . ( He was fourteen ; a strong breeze could do the same . ) Then the tall boy would clean himself up , and the girl would talk about Jesus , sin , adultery , hell , fornication , and country music songs sung by thin , pretty women . After that , he 'd walk home . She imagined him , halfway to that nice brick house where she still had never been , hearing a siren and breaking into a run , thinking she 'd called the cops , that the bright future his parents were forcing on him was going to blow up . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As school wound down , the girl got a job at a church camp in the Irish Hills of Michigan , farther north than she 'd ever been . That 's nice , said the tall boy . He 'd be busy , too , what with working in his parents ' store and especially the summer swim team . Hovering unstated between them was the fact she was still married . So again they broke it off . This had n't been a part of their daily lives , after all , just a strange , sweet thing , shiny with guilt , along the edges of what it was to be sophomores in a small town in Ohio . <p> At camp the girl 's job was to serve meals in the dining cabin and to clean up . In exchange , she attended camp for free : Bible study , canoeing , making string-art pictures of Jesus , shooting arrows at hay bales , and sneaking out of the cabin at midnight to smoke cigarettes and drink fortified wine on the beach of a mossy pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told the counselors not to call her Mrs. , since her marriage was getting annulled . Word got out , but the idea that a girl in one of those bleak cabins had been married  --  married !  --  was hard to believe . When kids asked her , she laughed and said nothing . At the nightly bonfires , she played her old guitar along with the two music majors from a Bible college in West Virginia who 'd been hired to lead the singing . She was as good as either of them . She wanted to sing her own songs ( it 's easy to change a song about " loving him " to one about " loving Him " ) , but she never got the nerve . She sang her songs alone in the woods behind the dining cabin , in the half hour of free time after she finished the lunch dishes . The last week of camp , she and one of the music majors , a redheaded man with a beard , wrote a song about the camp that mixed names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters . When they finished , he leaned toward her and kissed her . She kissed him back , then caught herself , pulled away , and reminded him she was married . He asked for forgiveness . She said he had to ask God for that . When it came time to perform the song in public , the girl played guitar and did not sing . <p> When she got home , she saw in the paper that the swim team had finished third in their championship meet . The tall boy had won two events . She called him . " Congratulations , " she said . <p> " For what ? " <p> " Your swimming . " <p> " Oh , " he said . " That . " <p> His voice was so dead she had to think fast , to save face . " My annulment went through , " she lied . " Can you come over ? " <p> " What does that mean , " he asked . <p> She could tell he was thrilled and afraid . " It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means . " <p> There was a long pause . " I 'm not sure I think anything . " <p> He was so dumb ! " Just come over , okay ? " <p> " I will , " he said , " if I can . My parents need me this week at the store . " <p> He did not come by . The girl was n't sure if she was surprised or relieved . <p> She 'd already lied and told the boy she was annulled . Was it worse to go before the law of man and  --  advised by her own mom that once did n't count  --  say the marriage had n't been consummated ? <p> One afternoon , a week before Labor Day , before their junior year was to start , the tall boy showed up at the girl 's house , riding a fifteen-speed racing bicycle . That was just like him , not to get a mountain bike like everyone else . Except the girl herself , who did n't know how to ride a bicycle . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Riding around and stuff . " <p> " I 'm sort of busy , " she said . She 'd been watching a comedy show about a rich man with a butler and three orphans , marveling that anyone , anywhere , had ever found this funny . <p> The tall boy asked about her summer . She said it was fine . She asked about his . It was fine . <p> " So , " he said . He was still standing astride his bike . <p> " Want some water ? " she said . <p> He tugged the skin of his throat . " Yeah , " he said . " I 'm parched . " <p> Parched ? That was what it was about this boy . Not just the racing bicycle . No one she knew said parched . When he was with her , she let herself think he was a boy who could take her out of their town to a place where people have nice lawns , personal computers , and fragile bicycles , and men do n't leave , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The tall boy chugged two glasses of water . They sat on the couch in the TV room and watched a show about crazy people stuck on an island . " A three-hour tour , " the boy said . " Why would they have all that luggage for a three-hour tour ? Why would they have any luggage ? " <p> " Beats me , " said the girl . " I 've never even been on a boat . " <p> Canoes at the camp , yes . But that was n't what he was talking about , canoes . <p> They got back to their old ways . This time when she touched him , it was n't through his underwear . As he left , he said that his parents and his little brother , Todd , were going away that weekend . " If you want to , like , stop over , that 'd be okay . " <p> Saturday morning , the girl got dressed in a yellow bikini that some of the other girls at the camp had said she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a swim at the public pool , which was on the west side . She pulled tight cutoffs over her bikini bottom and took a towel . It was n't such a long walk . She went barefoot . It was the end of summer . <p> The tall boy was in his driveway shooting baskets . He saw her , put the ball away , closed the garage , showed her into the house , locked the door , took the girl in his arms , and kissed her . She asked what he thought he was doing . " Really , I have no idea , " he said . " That 's the gospel truth . " <p> Was that blasphemous ? Or reverent ? " I have no idea , either , " she said . <p> The house was just a house , but it was so up-to-date and nice , as if , in preparation for her visit , it had been painted , carpeted , remodeled , and spring-cleaned . " Have you read all these books ? " she said . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At her house , the lone small bookcase was strewn with Avon decanters and commemorative shot glasses . <p> " Some , " he said . " They 're my parents ' books . " <p> Before they knew it , they were in each other 's arms and their clothes were coming off as if peeled by a divine hand . In times past the tall boy had glimpsed of the girl 's nipples and had often had her pants unzipped but not pulled down . The girl had seen the tall boy in a tiny Speedo and had her hand on his penis . This was the first time they 'd been naked together . It was the girl 's second naked and aroused man , the boy 's first naked and aroused girl , yet they hardly looked anywhere except into each other 's eyes . He pulled her gently down onto the rich gray carpeting , so thickly padded it felt nicer than a bed . " What do you think you 're doing ? " she whispered . <p> And the tall boy grimly said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew where this was leading . They rolled around and touched each other . They moved their hands in hapless , fumbling arcs over the curves of their unformed bodies . They kept looking at each other , and it reassured the girl to see fear in the tall boy 's eyes . Suddenly , moved by some unseen spirit , the boy rolled the girl onto her back and began to jab himself at her . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I may have a problem . " <p> He was trembling . She told him she 'd had problems before , with the man , problems they 'd taken days and been unable to solve . The tall boy stopped moving but remained on top of her . Their naked skin pressed lightly together . <p> " Maybe it 's wrong , " she said , " for us to do this . " <p> " You mean you never ? " he said . <p> " Once , " she said . " Only the once . " <p> He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still were n't looking upon their nakedness , just into each other 's eyes , and that , probably , was what made the girl reach down and take hold of the boy , inexpertly jabbing herself with his penis . Suddenly he was in . She said , " Oh ! " He also said , " Oh ! " They looked into each other like the terrified children they were , but now it was too late . She thought to twitch her hips . His eyes were open so wide . Her hips started doing a little more than twitching . The boy was on top , but he was frozen . She slowed down a little , and the boy pulled out and came all over that cute , round stomach . <p> He rolled over . He had his smooth back to her . The girl looked up at the smooth ceiling . Everything in his world was smooth . He got up and got her a warm washcloth and gently cleaned her . " I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I 'm really , really sorry . " <p> This time she did n't say it was okay . They got dressed . She wished she 'd worn a T-shirt over her bikini top . She found the bath towel she 'd brought from home and draped it around her neck . <p> " I 'm sorry , " the boy whispered . <p> She realized that because she had n't said it was okay he was starting to wonder if he was going to get in trouble . Saying it was okay would make him feel better . She felt womanly not to say it . She got up to leave . The tall boy followed , begging her to tell him what was wrong . She told herself she was n't going to say anything . <p> " Please , " the boy said . " I do n't know why , what I 'm feeling but ... " He asked her to sit down , on a bench in the mudroom . She looked out the window , counted to ten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall boy kneeled . " I do n't know who to tell , " he said . " I do n't know who to talk to . " He told a story about his best friend , Jason Hartsock , a boy from the swim team and the college-prep classes , whose mother , the tall boy said , was dying of cancer . <p> The girl hardly knew Jason Hartsock . She did not know that his mother was dying of anything . It was a cheap plea for sympathy . She wanted to go home . <p> But the boy went on and on about the homemade bread Mrs. Hartsock used to make and give to her friends , and about how great it made the Hartsocks ' house smell , and how his mother and Mrs. Hartsock talked endlessly on the phone or , together , over endless cups of coffee , and how Jason 's big brother , Bret , had said that if his mother died he did n't see how he could believe in God anymore . <p> For some reason , the girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head on her lap . She stroked his hair , and he kept talking about how Jason Hartsock had started going to parties and drinking twenty-plus bottles of Little Kings Cream Ale . When anyone said anything to Jason Hartsock about his mother , he 'd change the subject and talk about sports , even golf . <p> The boy started to cry . The girl kept stroking his hair . Who ever saw a boy so big cry so long ? <p> When he finished , he washed his face , and they stood in the mudroom and gave each other a hug . They kissed goodbye . He said goodbye . She said okay . <p> The girl stopped at the pool , paid her admission , and set up her towel on the cement sundeck . She took off her shorts . She lay there all afternoon in that yellow bikini . No one talked to her . She was happy about that . She tried to write a song in her head , a song about men . She ought to at least get a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write anything without her guitar . <p> And so she got up and , ignoring the lifeguard 's shrill whistle , climbed the steps to the high dive . She had never once done this before . For one thing , the high dive was closed except to the diving team . For another she could barely swim . But she was good at floating , more so since she 'd become a woman . The swimming instructor at camp had said this was natural . <p> When the girl got to the top , the lifeguard was screaming at her . She walked straight to the end of the board and jumped awkwardly off , closing her eyes and plugging her nose . She crashed into the water . It felt cold and harsh against her sunburned body . <p> Underwater , she opened her eyes . <p> Underwater , she asked God to show her the way . <p> Can you hear me , God , from underwater ? <p> She felt her feet touch the smooth painted bottom of the diving well . A sharp pounding feeling pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw her sign . Surely God would at least send the angry lifeguard into the pool to save her ? Her lungs began to burn . She felt a kind of gulping spasm in her throat . Her body betrayed her : she began to float toward the bright light of the surface . <p> Minister Steve was full of it . Courts disapprove of a person under the age of consent avoiding a consummated marriage , but the general rule is to grant an annulment as a matter of right . Allowable grounds include mental incompetency , intoxication , impotence , venereal disease , non-consummation , bigamy , incest , fraud , duress , lack of mutual consent , or that the underage spouse feels he or she made a mistake . Once the girl walked into the legal-aid office , things fell smoothly in place . <p> The girl was married once more before she finished high school . She had the baby , went to summer school , and graduated with her class . She is still married . She lives in the small town . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third Sunday of every month , she sings her own songs . <p> She never saw her father again ( he sells new house trailers at a sales lot in a certain suburb of Las Vegas , Nevada , that will remain nameless ) or her first husband , either ( he died a while ago , off the coast of the Florida panhandle , while trying to save a buddy who 'd gotten a little drunk , hooked a tarpon , and fallen overboard ) . The day the tall boy wept in his parents ' mudroom was the last time he and the girl ever spoke . ( He is currently writing a pilot for a TV show set in a candy factory in a small town in Ohio ; he has not set foot in his hometown since his parents retired to live near his brother , Todd , who is the youngest mayor in the history of one particular suburb of Phoenix , Arizona . ) Mrs. Hartsock died a slow , hideous death . Jason Hartsock and the tall boy went to different colleges and lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's funeral , said an ugly word , and stormed out . He no longer believes in God . <p> <p> By Mark Winegardner <p>
