The most important economic policymaking council in Washington these days may well be the private and informal one that has convened twice lately around the conference table in House Speaker Dennis Hastert 's suite in the Capitol . The faces at the table include four other congressional leaders of both parties , White House economic adviser Larry Lindsey , Bill Clinton 's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . When they first met , eight days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , Greenspan cautioned the group not to rush to revive the economy until they had time to measure the full effect of the tragedy . But last Wednesday , participants told TIME , the Fed chief brought a different message to the table . " We 've learned a lot in two weeks , " he said . With consumer spending sinking in nearly every sector but auto sales and movie tickets , he added , it was time for Congress to act  --  even though that would mean putting the government in the red for the first time in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been waiting for . Already the outlines of the economic stimulus package are clear . The White House and leaders of both parties have agreed with Greenspan 's assessment that new spending and tax cuts should total about 1% of the country 's annual income , that it should make its effects felt quickly and that it should not threaten to balloon the deficit so much down the road that it immediately raises long-term interest rates . But once you get past the parameters and into the particulars , the two parties in Congress do n't seem to be in accord on anything . <P> Maybe it 's a sign that Washington , like the rest of the country , is beginning to get back to normal . While the two parties acted more like one in the first weeks after the terrorist bombing  --  speedily authorizing Bush to use force , passing $40 billion in emergency disaster relief , approving a $15 billion bailout for airlines  --  last week they were back to their old bickering . Senate majority leader Tom Daschle branded the Republicans " obstructionist " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy blamed each other for holding up antiterrorism legislation . And House Ways and Means chairman Bill Thomas abruptly postponed a vote in his committee on giving the President new authority to negotiate trade agreements , when it became clear it had inflamed the Democrats . Even some who had normally favored open trade accused the Republicans of opportunism  --  using a national crisis to push through a priority . <P> Partisan differences are not necessarily a bad thing . " Bipartisanship is abnormal , " House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt says . " We all come here representing different people with different viewpoints , and a big part of our job is to express those viewpoints on the floor of the House . " <P> Nowhere are those differences more deeply felt than on the question of how to put the economy on its feet . The divisions boil down to classic party philosophy : Republicans want most of the roughly $75 billion to be spent on tax cuts for businesses and individuals . Democrats say the benefits should go largely to those hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower- and middle-income Americans and direct aid to the unemployed .
