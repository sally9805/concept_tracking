Dragon 's Fire By Anne McCaffrey Todd McCaffrey Random House Anne McCaffrey Todd McCaffrey CHAPTER I Sent from hold , sent from craft , Whether old , whether daft . Shunned for good into the wild -- Father , mother , baby child . Harper Hall , Second Interval , After Landing ( AL ) 490.3 He 's still waving , is n't he ? " Master Zist called back for the third time . He sat at the front of the wagon as it slowly drew away from the Harper Hall . The last of the winter snow covered the fields on either side of the track . Every now and then the wagon skidded as the workbeast lost his footing on the hard-packed icy snow and struggled to regain it . " Yes , he is , " Cayla agreed , looking back out of the brightly painted wagon at the small figure slowly diminishing in the distance . " We could n't bring him , " Zist said regretfully . " He 'd be too obvious . " At least , Zist thought to himself , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd first told him their plans . Pellar had thrown a silent tantrum , had sprawled on the ground in the Harper Hall 's courtyard , feet and fists hitting the ground in his outrage . He stopped only when Carissa had started howling in sympathy with him . " She 's crying for me , is n't she ? " he scrawled quickly on the slate that was never far from his hands . " Yes , I suppose she is , " Cayla answered . Pellarswiftly rubbed his slate clean and scrawled a new comment on it , thrusting it under Zist 's eyes . " Are you taking her ? " " We have to , she 's still nursing . " " We want to know that you 're safe , here , " Cayla added . " Are n't I part of your family ? " Pellar scrawled in response , tears streaming down his face . " Of course you are ! " Zist declared vociferously . " And we need you , as a member of our family , to stay here out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , Pellar , " Cayla said firmly . " You 've been part of our family since we first found you , ten Turns ago , " Zist told him . " Then why ca n't I come ? " Pellar scrawled on his slate , his mouth working soundlessly in emphasis . " Because we do n't know who abandoned you , " Zist told him , catching Pellar 's chin in his hand and forcing the youngster to meet his eyes . " It could be some who were Shunned . If you come with us and they see you , they 'll know that we 're not Shunned . " " You could get in trouble then ? " Pellar wrote . Zist nodded . Pellar chewed his lip miserably , shoulders shaking so hard with his unvoiced sobs that he could barely wipe his slate to write a new message . " I 'll stay . No trouble for you . " Cayla read the note , thrust baby Carissa into Zist 's arms , and grabbed Pellar into a firm and fierce hug . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing the top of his head . " I 'll be here when you get back , " Pellar wrote . " I promise you 'll be the first to hear us return , " Zist swore , freeing a hand to clap the boy on the back . " He 's stopped waving , " Cayla reported . " Oh , dear ! His shoulders are all slumped and he looks so sad . " Zist blew out a misty breath and pulled on the reins controlling the workbeast , fighting with himself not to turn the wagon back . " Murenny promised he 'd keep an eye on him , " Cayla said , noting how the wagon had slowed . " And this was your idea . " " Indeed , " Zist agreed , his shoulders slumping in turn . " I think it 's absolutely necessary that we learn all we can about the Shunned --  " " I do n't disagree with you , " Cayla interjected , lifting baby Carissa in her arms and rocking her instinctively . " Thread will come again soon enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeating his reasons needlessly . " If there are enough Shunned , what 's to stop them from overwhelming a hold or craft hall ? " Cayla did n't have to say a word to make her opinion of that clear ; she 'd said enough before . " Well , even if they do n't , what will they do when Thread comes again ? " Zist asked reflectively . " It 's not right to condemn them all to a death no one on Pern should ever experience . " " I know , love , I know , " Cayla said soothingly , recognizing that her mate was working himself into another passionate discourse . She knew from past discussions how vivid the image of Thread , falling mindlessly from the sky , devouring all life , searing all flesh , was engrained in Zist 's mind from his reading . " We 've discussed this , Murenny 's discussed this , and that 's why we 're here in this wagon , dressed like the Shunned --  " " Do you think we should put an ' S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , pointing to the purple-blue mark on his forehead . " No , " Cayla said in a tone that brooked no argument . " And you 'd best be right about how to get that mark off . " " It 's not proper bluebush ink , " Zist reminded her . The sap of the bluebush , used for marking the Shunned , was indelible and permanently stained skin . " Some pinesap , lots of hot water and soap , and it 'll come off . " " So you 've said , " Cayla remarked , sounding no more convinced . In front , Zist noticed that the workbeast was slowing and flicked the reins to encourage it back to a faster walk . " Well , I 'm glad you 're with me , " Zist told Cayla , after satisfying himself that they were moving fast enough . " I 'm glad that we left Pellar behind , " Cayla said . " Ten Turns is too young to see the sights we expect . " " Indeed , " Zist agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Cayla continued , half to answer Zist 's unspoken thought , half to answer her own fears . " There 'll be children among the Shunned , " Zist remarked . " That 's part of what makes it so wrong . " " Yes , " Cayla agreed . She flicked a wisp of her honey-blond hair back behind her ear and continued rocking little Carissa . Then she looked back again . " He 's gone now . " " We 'll be back in less than half a Turn , " Zist said after a moment of thoughtful silence . " He 'll be all right . " " I hope he 'll forgive us , " Cayla said . Zist took the coast road south , toward Hold Gar , Southern Boll Hold , and warmer weather . He and Cayla had guessed that the warmer climes would attract the Shunned , who would find the harsh winters of the north harder to survive . The road was still snow-covered and never more than a pair of ruts running down along the coastline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped herself up tightly and nuzzled little Carissa close to her side to keep them both warm . In front , perched on the rattling bench seat , Zist had a thick wher-hide blanket spread over his knees and layers of warm thick-knit Tillek sweaters , the same as those used by the Tillek sailors because they kept out the worst of the wet and cold even at sea . Even so , Zist was chilled to the bone every evening when they halted . They were both relieved when they finally came upon the outskirts of Hold Gar . Their reception by the holders was sharp and unpleasant . " Go away ! " shrieked the first old woman whose cothold they had stopped at , hoping to barter for food . " Would you have me Shunned , too ? " She hurried them on their way by throwing stones and setting her dogs on them . " Go back north and freeze ! We 're hardworking folk down here , " she yelled after them . " You wo n't find any handouts . " Zist shared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bawling Carissa . As they neared the next hold , Cayla glanced quickly at the " S " on Zist 's forehead . " Maybe I should go by myself , " she suggested . " Bring the baby , " Zist agreed . " I 'll tend the beast . " Carissa returned later , smiling and carrying a sack full of goods . " They cost more than they should , " she said when she handed the bag to Zist . " The lady fed us , though , and had fresh milk for Carissa . " Two days later they came upon a wagon by the side of the road . It had been burned down to the wheels . Zist halted . He went to the wreck , crawled around and through it , and came back thirty minutes later , his face grim . " They were caught while they were sleeping , " he told Cayla . " How do you know it was n't an accident with a lantern ? " Cayla asked . While holders used glows , the Shunned had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often meant candles or lanterns . " I 'd rather not say , " he replied grimly . " I suppose we should keep a watch at nights , " Cayla said . " Maybe we should turn back , " Zist said . " This is beginning to seem more dangerous than I 'd feared . " " Perhaps this is what happened to Moran . " " Perhaps , " Zist agreed , his face going pale . With a sour look , he gestured to the burned wreck . " There has to be a better way to deal with the Shunned . " " We do n't know what happened here . We know that some were Shunned for murder . After being Shunned , what would stop them from murdering again ? " Cayla responded . " Perhaps we 're only seeing justice done . " " No , " Zist said , shaking his head firmly . " That was a wagon much like ours . " Cayla realized from what he 'd left unsaid that the occupants of the wagon were much like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should move on before we attract attention , " she said firmly . " I 'd like you to keep watch from the back of the wagon , " Zist said by way of agreement . " Of course . "
