Sheila Finch 's new story is a bit more British than our usual fare , but it 's certainly to good effect . If any readers come to the end of the story and do n't recognize the passenger ... well , without giving anything away , let 's just say he was more at home in land vehicles than at sea . <p> " There must be a beginning of any great matter .... " A LIGHT BREEZE CAME OUT of the north , ruffling the dark water of the Channel . The flotilla of small fishing ketches , pleasure boats , and private yachts struggled across under cover of night . The water was black with a slick sheen of motor oil glinting dimly in starlight , its smell a familiar mix of diesel , salt , and rotting kelp . The owner of the sloop My Gal Mary clung to the gunwale , his stomach roiling . Nerves , he told himself , not seasickness . He 'd never been seasick in his life . " Skipper ? " Digger held out a steaming thermos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you good ! " He disliked being called " Skipper . " It seemed pretentious , a name only a Londoner like Digger would use . The man had been playing darts with the locals in the pub in Margate when the major came ; he 'd been the first to volunteer . The My Gal Mary sailed better with two crewing , and he could n't use his wife for this trip , so he 'd reluctantly taken Digger on . Surprisingly , the man seemed to know something about sailing - unusual for a Londoner - at least enough to handle the tiller . Judging from Digger 's sun-darkened face and hands , he must spend a lot of time outdoors , again not typical . He cupped both hands around the mug , grateful for its warmth on a chilly night . June already , but it might as well have been November , with a low overcast . Good weather for a rescue operation , but now he wished he 'd taken his wife 's advice and worn the heavy pullover under his waterproof anorak . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fine lass , but she 'd have been sick with worry if she 'd known . There was a very good chance he might not come back ; the major who 'd called the meeting at the pub had warned them about that . At least he was n't being asked to kill men , just bring them home . The next boat over was the Moss Rose , a private yacht twice the length of his sloop , and beyond that he could make out the Brighton Belle , more used to puttering up and down the coast with a load of holiday makers down from London than braving the open waters of the nasty-tempered Channel . The old motorized lifeboat from Margate overtook him and left him behind . Hundreds of small boats like these , he thought . Most of them had already picked up their cargo and were heading back to Dover before daybreak ; the My Gal Mary was one of the last to make the crossing . With luck , there ought to be some navy boats in the pack to cover them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dark day for England . He felt the Mary settle and glanced up at the mainsail in time to see it start to luff . The breeze dropped . Ever since he was a little lad , he 'd been sensitive to the wind 's vagaries , knowing long before the telltales did that it was going to shift . The boom went loose . He took up the mainsheet and trimmed the sail , but there was n't enough wind left to fill it . The Mary 's motor was small and balky , a luxury to make docking a sailboat in tight quarters easier ; it would have to work hard tonight . The little petrol tank had been full when they left the harbor at Margate , but if the wind did n't cooperate , he 'd have a tough time getting to the French coast and back without running out of fuel . He lowered the sail and furled it neatly . The motor spluttered messily to life on the second try . He heard the drone of a frustrated Messerschmidt overhead , above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . He gave the Londoner a thumbs-up . Then a tear opened in the cloud cover , and in the sudden gap he saw the fighter bank and turn , diving down to strafe the vulnerable sailboat , heard the heavy drone of its engine , the rat-tat of its guns There was something the matter with his head now , a pounding in his temples like a drum . He had the oddest sensation of floating away from his body in the rising wind " Take it easy , Skipper . " Digger caught his arm and eased him down to the deck . He looked up into a dark face that was eager , hungry . " It 's your time , " Digger said . It was the last thing he knew before the wind carried him away . " The wind commands me away . " THE END WAS SUDDENLY upon him . Death came to sit in his cabin . Wind blustering out of the northeast moaned in the rigging . The sea rose and fell , rose and fell , the Defiance at anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the ruins of Nombre de Dios . The times and the seas were not as he remembered them , as once , a young man , he had encountered them , neither as kind nor as steady . His last expedition , and a failure . He was far from England and would never round Plymouth Hoe again . " So it has come to this , " Drake said . Death inclined his bare head courteously , dark curls tightly clustered . The lantern over Drake 's cot flickered . The air in the cabin was thick and hot , giving little comfort to his labored breath . The hourglass lacked a few turns till dawn . " We are old shipmates , then ? " " We have sailed together since Nombre de Dios , " Death agreed . " And at Nombre de Dios shall it end ? " His brow was hot and wet with the fever that had come upon him . The bloody flux , they called it . He heard them whispering when they thought he slept , Jonas and Thomas Webb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he commanded , breath rasping in his throat , fingers clutching at the bulkhead for purchase as he tried to rise . " William , I say ! Fetch me my armor . I will die as I have lived , a soldier for her majesty . " Death stretched out a dark hand , easing him back on the cot . " Peace . The page hears you not . " He stared at the figure wrapped in a sailor 's foul-weather cloak , watchmate on many a wind-torn night , the perilous ocean rolling beneath the ship , steadfast companion encompassing the world . " Water , " he said , weakness returning . Death took the cup and leaned forward , giving drink ; his free hand stroked the damp hair on the dying man 's hot brow , his touch gentle as a woman 's . After a while , Drake said , " Pirate , the Spaniard called me , and spoke truth . I have killed many men . Though they were papists and idolaters , I fear God may yet hold me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look . " He looked , and was instantly carried away to the past . Shortly before dawn on the twenty-eighth of july , the Pasco riding at anchor in the bay on a windless night , the Moon broke free of the clouds . Nombre de Dios lay revealed , dark shadow against dark Caribbean coast , the treasure house of the world that would be his before night fell again . he had given up the slaving runs with his kinsman John Hawkins , for he had seen greater profit in raiding along the mouth of the Chagres River where the treasure came down from Panama to be loaded for the voyage home to Spain . He could not afford further delay . he had learned that the town was heavily fortified against an expected attack from the cimarrones , runaway Negro slaves who had established their own villages outside Spanish control . His men were so few against so many . Now was the time to move , while surprise remained his weapon . On the beach , he divided the force , one group to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in from the flank with his brother John . They were armed with pike and bow , spear and arquebus . Flame sprang from the tallow-soaked rags on the firepikes , giving more smoke than light . Two trumpeters raised their trumpets , preparing to give voice , and before them all went the boy with the drum making a joyful noise . Drake smiled . God grant the good folk of Nombre de Dios not learn how few their noisy attackers were ! Already he could hear bells pealing out warning of invasion . Shouts echoed as the town awoke to its peril . His heart raced with the promise of papist treasure to be taken . he never felt more alive than at moments like this at the start of battle , unless it was a fight at sea . " For England ! " he cried to the men . And for their own pockets too , if the fabled treasure house yielded all that was told of it . Gold and silver and jewels waiting to be carried back to Spain 's king . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the little church 's bell tower . The alcalde , a balding , middle-aged man in disheveled dress as though he had risen hastily from his bed , stood with the town 's militia , a mixed group of Spanish settlers and Negro slaves . A volley of shot greeted Drake 's party and one trumpeter went down instantly . seeing his companion fall , the boy with the drum hesitated . This was the lad 's first voyage ; he was hardly a year older than Drake 's own youngest brother , Joseph , and had never seen battle . Drake seized his shoulder , pushing him back behind the armed men . Yelling from both sides - shot flying over his head - he heard a scream as one found its target . A Spaniard down . His men charged forward , pikes ready to taste blood . He felt a sudden , fierce pain take him in the right thigh and for a moment sound blurred and the world misted over . he slumped to one knee , breath gone from his lungs . Then he regained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pain , unwilling to have his men see him weakened . " Captain ? " The drummer lad said . " Captain , look ! " At the other side of the market square , his brother 's men appeared , howling like the dogs of war . The Spaniards threw down their weapons and ran away . But Drake knew it would not be long before they realized how few were the men who had routed them . No time to waste . The Spaniards had abandoned the slaves who fought with them , and the Africans now stood about hesitantly , uncertain of their fate . One of these Africans , taller than the rest , drew Drake 's attention . Ignoring the throb of his leg wound , Drake limped over to the slave . There were those , his kinsman Hawkins among them , who believed God had not made the African fully human , and it was therefore no sin to sell them into servitude . " You , good sir . " he used a mixture of English and gestures , Spanish being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you a name ? " The slave did not lower his eyes . " Diego . " " Then , Diego , you shall lead us to the house of the alcalde . " The slave turned without a word and led them to a house not far from the marketplace . It was deserted . The men crowded inside . Silver graced the tables and sideboards , candlesticks and serving trays and chased dishes from which the alcalde 's family supped . The room was thick with the smell of burning candles . Drake felt dizzy . The men began to pile up the silver , ready to carry it off . Not enough ! he thought , squinting against the stab of reflected light . Here were trinkets , yet he sought treasure . Too little here to risk the return of the Spaniards . " Cease ! " he commanded . The effort to form words made him tremble ; he clenched his hands to hide their betrayal . " Be not distracted by small reward . Think what riches are stored in the king 's warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astonished . " Aye , " one grumbled , " yet they say - " Drake cut him off . " I have brought you to the mouth of the treasure house of the world . Henceforth , you shall have none to blame but yourselves if you fail to take it . " All who served Drake knew of his hot temper and avoided its sting . They filed out of the house in silence , but he felt their hidden resentment . Outside , a wave of nausea came over him from the wound he had taken . he could not feel his leg , did not know how he would put one leg in front of the other . he was not afraid of dying in the service of England , but please God - not now when the great voyage of his life had just begun . The day that had broken fair a few hours ago turned stormy , and a heavy rain pelted them , soaking the powder in their weapons . Every moment that passed allowed the Spaniards to overcome their terror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forced himself to go forward . He felt a hand steadying his elbow and looked up into the impassive face of the black slave . A memory came to him at that . he had been with his kinsman in Rio de la Hacha , a few years ago , where another Negro slave defected from his masters and guided them to hidden Spanish treasure . The English and the Negro slaves , he understood , had a common enemy . But when the English sailed away with their gold , Hawkins abandoned the man , and Drake could only suppose the Spaniards put him to death . " There is berth on the Pasco , and work to put a hand to , " he said . Diego stared at him for a moment , then inclined his head silently . " You are wounded , Captain ! " the drummer lad exclaimed , pointing at the sand where Drake 's footsteps were marked with blood . The rain had ceased , but it seemed to him a heavy fog rolled in , clouding his vision and sealing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . The wind , he thought , the wind that commanded a ship away . The last thing he saw before he fell was the face of the African slave . " Thou wouldst have taken me so soon , Master Death ? " he said , lapsing into the speech of his childhood . he held one hand over his eyes , for the flickering light pained him . The Defiance rolled gently in the Caribbean swell . Death reached for the lantern and turned down the flame . " It was time . " " By what grace did I live ? " " Some bargain with me at the hour of their death and some offer gifts . " " I spared a slave , " Drake said . " A small enough deed . " Afterward , his brother had abandoned the plan to storm the treasure house of Nombre de Dios . Instead , they had carried him back to the Pasco , valuing his life higher than all the gold that might have lain behind the strong doors . Beneath the stout timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a babe at his mother 's breast . How well he knew these waters ! Yet all had changed , and not for the better , and in truth he knew it no longer . What had been once a delicious and pleasant arbor was now a waste and desert wilderness . A spasm wracked his body and blood came to speckle his lips . he gasped for air to fill his tortured lungs . After a moment , he found breath to say , " You spared my life , kind Master Death , and I would know if my soul were worth the saving . " " Think you it was not ? " Death asked . He turned his head away . " I am no papist , yet I feel the weight of lives I have taken and would discharge it - if t'were possible - before I am carried to my Maker . " The mirror reappeared in Death 's hand . THEY HAD BEEN MARCHING for seven days through a thick and tangled jungle so green it seemed more artifice than nature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with the heavy scent of vivid blossoms , their colors more brazen than any that grew in his garden in Devon . Mud sucked at his boots , and his pack grew heavier , though not as heavy as those the cimarrones bore . In the half-year since he had taken the wound at Nombre de Dios , he had forged an alliance with these outlaws , for their zeal to strike papists was equaled only by his own . The Spanish fleet had arrived . Treasure now flowed across the isthmus of Panama to be loaded for Spain , and his enemy must surely expect him to attack . Yet this time he had decided to interrupt the flow of wealth not by sea but on land . This venture must succeed ; fate had not been kind to him so far , and his men grew restless . Nor had he escaped unscathed ; though he had survived , his brother John had not . Tiny creatures he could not name slid past his feet , and popinjays shrieked overhead , brightly plumed as the rainbow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Plymouth ; on his return , he would tell her of these wonders and she would smile , only half-believing . Nor gold nor Spaniards defeated amused her , yet the tale of a bird like a rainbow could widen her eyes . His own eye was caught by a flash of crimson and emerald underfoot , and he stopped before his boot could crush it . He put the feather in his pack for Mary , who would treasure it above rubies . They kept to the undergrowth to avoid giving notice of their approach . He knew his men would sooner brave the fiercest storm at sea than this damp , unhealthy land , and the lad with the drum made heavy walking of it . The cimanones , thirty dark men burning with hate for their former masters , seemed untouched by heat or rain . He had come to admire their strength carrying heavy loads and cutting trail . Their courage to risk all in this enterprise was not unlike that of his own Devon men . How then , he wondered , could a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation ? Surely the soul of an African weighed as heavily in the palm of God 's hand as that of any Englishman . He thought about this as he walked . he did not hesitate to steal gold and burn ship or town . he gloried in destroying idolatrous statues , tapestried altars , window glass bearing glowing symbols of the devil 's handiwork . Yet he thought it sin to kill without cause , freeing his captives after he had taken their wealth if they did not defy him . The cimarrones desired revenge as he desired riches . His plan was to ambush the mule trains that carried the treasure across the isthmus to the port of Nombre de Dios . If God willed , he would gain great wealth for England but spill little blood . Shortly before the band reached the isthmus , Diego took him aside and brought him to a high hill where he saw an enormous old tree . Popinjays fluttered in its branches . The rain had stopped and the Sun now poured golden light down from a sky so intensely blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiped sweat off his brow . The African pointed to steps cut into the trunk leading to a platform of planks lashed together high overhead . Curious , he went up , scattering the noisy birds . From the platform , he found himself looking east over the familiar Caribbean , dotted with palm-fringed islands and galleons plying their way to and from the ports of the Spanish Main . But on the western side of the isthmus he saw a vast , empty expanse of blue water , an ocean no Englishman had ever looked upon . A wind he did not know teased the tops of the waves into whitecaps. he sensed its salt breath beckoning him to hoist sail and run before it into the most secret places of the world . The enormity of this strange unknown pulled at his heart , thrilling him . What treasure lay beyond those waves ? A treasure not of mere gold and silver but of new things never seen or thought before . " Riches there , " Diego said . " Gold - spice - slaves . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pulled his gaze away from the ocean and met the African 's eyes . Something passed between them , but he knew not what it was , only that what must be would be . " There are no gods but the Lord Christ . " Afterward , Drake set up camp a day 's journey from Panama and planned an ambush . Three mule trains were to pass along the trail by the Chagres River that evening on their way to the harbor . he commanded one half of his band , under John Oxenham , to lie hidden in the long grass at one point along the mule path and urged them to silence ; he with the other would wait a little farther ahead . When the convoy was safely past the first band , Oxenham 's men would close in behind , and with the others rising up in its path , he would catch them like rabbits in his trap , relieve them of their precious burden and let them go . A breeze too light to fill the highest topgallant brought the tinkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voices calling out in Spanish . He judged they were almost at the point where they would pass Oxenham 's group . Then he heard the sound of a horse 's hooves . he peered through the brush in the moonlight and made out a single rider , coming down the path from the opposite direction . " Let him pass , " he whispered to his men . The rider passed Drake without breaking stride , and though the horse pricked its ears , catching the scent of hidden men , the rider seemed unaware of the peril . all would be well A shout ! He heard the Spaniard urging his horse to the gallop toward the oncoming mule train not yet inside the trap . Then a babble of confused voices , English and Spanish , and he knew all was lost . The rider had given warning . The mule train turned away from the ambush . Anger surged through him . How had this come to pass ? Who was to blame ? Oxenham came up the path with two sailors holding a third between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cimanones muttered amongst themselves . His own fury roared like a fire within his breast till he could hardly think . all preparation wasted ! So much time lost ! " Hastening to spill enemy blood , he lost all for us , " a soft voice said at his ear . " What to do ? " He turned to Diego . The African 's eyes seemed to open on the deeps of a vast and dangerous destiny . he sensed a challenge that both excited and repelled . Then it passed . A sudden gust brought sea smell to him , green and fecund , cleansing his anger . " Captain , " Oxenham said . " By your command , the lash ? Or give the word and I shall cut this knave 's throat ! " Tears ran down the bloated cheeks of the man who had given warning . A drunkard , Drake saw , not a traitor . He walked away . " Aye , " he said , remembering . " They would have taken a scapegoat and killed him for the ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defiance trembled under him as though startled in her turn by the past , and the lantern sputtered and went out . " You stayed the hand of those who would kill the offender , " Death said . " It was a merciful decision . " Drake fell to coughing again ; Death wiped the spittle from his lip . " Thought you I were bloody-minded , old friend ? " Drake asked when breath returned . " What does it profit a man to spill the blood of fools and drunkards ? " " Or papists ? " Death asked . Drake sighed . " We are English , well disposed even to our enemies if there be no cause to the contrary . " The sickness raged in his bowels again , and he desired his end . Then he put up a hand . " Nay , kind Master Death . I do fear my Maker , for I have much blood on my hands and no time left to wipe it clean . " " Power is mine in this world , to carry away when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion , " Death said . Drake turned his head away , listening to the wind 's voice in the rigging . A good breeze rising - but he would never sail before it again . " Then my soul shall be weighed in the balance , and the fires of hell attend my coming . Away then ! I will not keep the good demons waiting . " Death lifted his hands and the mirror flashed in the dim cabin with a light of its own . " There is more , " Death said . The natives came down the hillside out of the gray fog that had shrouded this cold Pacific coast since the Golden Hind dropped anchor . Overhead red hawks floated , their cries piercing Drake 's heart with melancholy . he had sailed north along land unknown even to the Spaniards till the astrolabe told forty-eight degrees latitude . he had been searching for a passage back to the Atlantic , but instead of opening east , the land headed west , and the weather was so cold meat froze as it was taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed south again , and near thirty-eight degrees he found a small bay to shelter in . He had been at sea two years on this voyage , and sometimes he feared he would never see the green hills of Devon again . But he was careful not to let the men catch his doubt . He gazed at the oncoming natives . They were a formidable company adorned in animal hides and shells , wearing tall hats of woven reeds . The men 's faces were painted in fierce designs , and they were armed with spears and bows , but at the rear he saw women and children . He judged they were not a war party , for nowhere had he found warriors who brought their families to battle . he waited to see what would happen , watching the wet mist curl through tall pines , hearing the hawks " voices and the boom and hiss of the sea at his back , smelling its salt tang . He needed time to scrape the Hind 's hull and caulk it , and time to gather provision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vessel was loaded with gold and silver , but he needed the fresh water , fruit , and venison this land might provide ; he hoped he would not have to shed blood for them . he had taken in hand an enterprise that he knew not in the world how to go through with , yet he knew neither regret nor fear . All that he did was for England 's sake . he asked only that God allow him to serve his country till his last day . The natives halted , and one took it upon himself to deliver a long speech , not one word of which Drake understood . But he was skilled at reading the intention that men hid behind their words , and in this the natives were no different than English gentlemen or Spanish knaves . It was his way to return courtesy when courtesy was offered , bloodshed when treachery threatened . After a while he knew they intended no harm . For a moment , Englishmen and natives stared at each other , then he who seemed to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should sit , and all sat . Two of the natives advanced toward Drake and decorated his neck with chains of woven grasses intertwined with shells . They put a tall hat on his head as if it were a crown , and a carved branch into his hand for a scepter . They bowed , and he nodded his good will back to them . Now his sailors laughed , nervously at first , then with growing pleasure . " They make you king - give you all , " Diego said softly in his ear . Drake shook his head , troubled by the African 's words . Were this Spanish land , he would capture it and subdue the enemy who inhabited it with a joyful heart and light conscience . Yet these natives greeted him in peace , and in peace he must return the greeting . He lifted his hand and the drummer beat a soft tattoo as the young boys in his company , cabin boys and pages of the gentlemen aboard , came forward with gifts in their turn . Hats with ribbons they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal for the tribe 's leader . he gave orders that the men should treat these natives with courtesy , and not abuse them in the fashion of Spaniards . Yet to the Hind 's pastor he allowed the occasion to speak a little of the Lord , for though the natives " ears might not understand the holy words yet their hearts would surely let Him in . Thus the day passed with feasting and music from the ship 's musicians , and much merriment between the two companies . At nightfall , the natives withdrew in peace . Afterward , Drake walked on the narrow beach with Diego , foul-weather cloaks wrapped tightly about both men 's shoulders against the damp air . In truth he preferred this misty climate , for the cold was more suited to English blood than the disease-laden air of the Caribbean . And did it not have low white cliffs separating sea from land , very much like those he remembered from England 's coast ? A small wind lifted out of the west , calling him back to sea . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " A man might build a stout fortress here , Captain , " Diego said . He glanced at the tall African . Diego had been with him seven years , yet this night he thought how little he knew the man . " This man might take the land . Live as a king . " " Nay , " Drake said , laughing . " Tempt me not in jest , my friend . " " They that oppose shall be easily overthrown . " A hard light lit Diego 's eyes , and Drake felt the feather touch of unease . The African enjoyed the thought of killing . Had he not recognized that when first they met ? " I am no conquistador , " Drake said . " I find this land freely given to England 's queen . Its name shall be Nova Albion . " " You could have been a king , " Death said . In Defiance 's dark cabin , Death 's right hand now held a golden balance , the bowls carved in the likeness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It had been a full life and , though he would not live to see three score years , well spent . Some called him pirate , yet the queen had knighted him in London for his service . " Prithee , good Master Death , how does my life weigh in the balance ? " " Judgment is not given to me . I do but show what is . " Death 's left hand tipped the golden bowls and they wavered , up , down , up , down . Then one turned dark and sank low . Blood and fire flickered in it , the clang of weapon against weapon , the sound of wounded men 's screams in darkness . Hatred and vengeance and the lust for treasure swarmed like petty devils in the bowl , and Drake sickened to look upon them . " These speak against you , Captain . " He stared at the dark face , reading Death 's hunger . he spoke uneasily . " I can not undo these things I have done . Nor would I , if t'were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have seen best , a gentleman and a Christian , and a servant of my queen . " It seemed to him then that he heard the faint sound of music somewhere on the Defiance . he had always loved music , pipe and drum and lute , and never set sail without musicians aboard . But it was only the wind soughing through the ship 's lines . Death 's left hand touched the golden bowls again , and this time a bright one came to rest below its mate . Light spilled over its rim , banishing shadow from the cabin . Now Drake heard joyful voices : cimanones singing in their villages ; the natives of his own Nova Albion , never seen again but in his dreams . God 's children all . he saw the faces of all the mariners he had let live , soldiers whose lives he had spared after battle , slaves he had freed , his first wife Mary whom he had truly loved , all together as though it were but one day passing . The stars that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This too you have wrought , " Death said . " Touch thy finger to this side , good Master Death . Mayhap it will weigh heavier and carry me up to heaven ! " Death 's voice seemed to come from a long way off , and his speech was the gentler speech of Drake 's childhood . " Stuck thou art , twixt heaven and hell . " " Purgatory ? Nay , Master Death . " Drake closed his eyes . " Give me no papist teaching at the end . " " I have one boon to grant . Thy sleep shall be long till England needs thee . On that dark day you shall answer her call and rise again to defend her . " Already he could feel himself separating from his pain-wracked body , streaming away from the world he had loved so well . " Sleep , you say ? As Arthur sleeps in his lake till he needs must come again ? " Death inclined his head and Drake saw what he had not seen before , that the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black curls . And he saw too the lust for killing in Death 's eyes , an appetite for harvesting men 's lives . " We chased the Spaniard 's armada out of the Narrow Sea , " Drake said . " He will not soon come again . " " Perchance not soon , mayhap not from Spain . " " On guard for England , " he said , wondering at it . Then he laughed . " No purgatory , this ! " Now his vision shifted , and he saw as though he were high up , looking through sea mist , that men had entered his cabin , Jonas , and Thomas Webb , others too . he watched from afar as they lifted his body into the lead coffin they had prepared . he saw tears on their cheeks , and the faces of his men cast down in grief . They spoke , but the wind seized their words . A strong wind , he thought , a wind commanding him away . A young lad beat the drum slowly as they carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue water of the Caribbean . " Hear me now , England , " Drake said . " In that day of thy need , I shall return . For nothing pleases me better than to see the enemy flying with a southerly wind to the northward ! " The coffin sank away from sight . " ... until it be thoroughly finished . " The SEA ROLLED UNDER HIM and a fine spray came over the bow . Drake 's eyes flew open . he was half lying on the deck of a small boat , half leaning against a man 's leg . The dark breath of the water brought him fully awake and he sat up . " No water on this round globe but the Narrow Sea smells so putrid ! " " Got that right , Skipper , " a familiar voice agreed . " The Channel it is . " He looked up at Diego . The man 's face was dark , yet not as black as he remembered it . " And you , it seems , like the good popinjays of Panama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he put a hand on the gunwale and pulled himself up . Then he stared down at the jacket he was wearing with its unfamiliar fastenings . " Is this the fashion of London ? " " You 've slept a long time , " Diego said . He thought about that , finding no memory from that sleep ; no dreams had come to haunt it , mayhap because he had not been truly dead . Then he became aware of the thin trickle of blood from his left temple . " It seems I have taken a wound . " " The man that owned the clothes and this boat 's dead . " " And it profits me naught to ask why my return must cost a man his life ? " " No . " Drake searched his mind but found no name for the man he had become . Then the strangeness of it caught him , and his breath stopped in his throat . he remembered a hammock on the Defiance , the lad with the drum , the coffin lowered into the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , alive , in another man 's body . The notion chilled . He turned quickly , banishing the uneasy thoughts , to peer out over the water , narrowing his eyes against fog and darkness . Here and there he made out shiny patches , as if shards of a black mirror drifted out to sea . Somewhere out there , he sensed the presence of a multitude of ships but could not see any of them . he listened for the telltale creak of wooden hulls and masts , the sough of breeze in rigging , the damp flap of sailcloth . All that came to his ears was a strange low rumbling that he could not identify . There was an echoing throb in the deck under his boots and an odd smell . There was no sail hoist up the sloop 's one mast , yet he sensed the forward motion . " So small a boat against the Spaniard ! Shall I command from this ? " Diego sat in the stern , one hand on the tiller . " We sail with everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " England in defeat ? I take no pleasure in those words . " " I 've been busy , " Diego admitted . Drake gazed at Diego 's face , the dark eyes lit for just a moment with an inhuman lust . " Perchance I shall have occasion to cheat you of some booty , old pirate . " After a while , the sky lightened with approaching dawn , and in the milky haze he saw a strange sight . Hundreds of boats - many of them hardly bigger than the one he found himself on . Most carried no sails or masts to hoist a sail . The vibration he felt underfoot was odd , yet familiar too . he thought of the leat he 'd built to bring water to Plymouth , and the mills he 'd owned on its bank , the great wooden wheels lumbering under the rush of water and shaking the floor . A wheel that moved a ship , could that be ? " Yes , " Diego said , as if privy to Drake 's thought . " As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your ancestor 's long bow . " " What am I to do here ? " " You 'll see , Skipper . Do n't you worry ! " Diego kept the boat on course with an ease that brought to Drake 's mind their days on the Golden Hind , his favorite vessel . The African had taken advantage of calm seas encircling the Spice Islands to study the art of the helmsman . Indeed , he realized now , Diego had the helm on the night when the Hind drove with a terrible shock onto a reef , threatening to drown all who sailed on her . It had been no easy task to prevent Death from claiming the greater part of his crew . he had not guessed in those days who sailed with him harboring such an appetite . Shortly before dawn , the low coast of France loomed , unwelcoming as ever he remembered it , now overhung with a thick pall of black smoke . In the gray light he saw the stone walls and jetties of a harbor where dozens of ships crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted the entrance ; the flotilla must thread its way between them . Men 's urgent shouts filled the air . he saw hundreds of men - thousands - waiting on the moles and the narrow beach beside the harbor , jostling , clambering aboard the waiting vessels . Lord Christ ! he thought . What devil 's work be here ! " Now we wait our turn , " Diego said . His heart filled with despair at the enormity of the task he had come back to perform . " Methinks I see a contest loom between us , Master Death , for you would take and I would save . " " No contest , " Diego said easily . " We 've come to rescue one man . " " " But one ? he needs must be a prince ! " Noise overhead drew his attention . he saw the strangest sight - two small craft like steel birds swooping and diving , filling the air with thunder . Nothing he knew from his life could explain them , yet he understood at once these birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively something so terrible sprang from the mind of Death himself . " T was all a game then ? " he said with sudden insight . " You spared my life and sailed with me not because I freed a slave . Nay . To see how you might tempt me to feed your appetite for souls ! " " I always win in the end , " Diego said . " Aye , that you do ! " Drake said sourly . " But the game is to see how long a man may put off that end , is it not ? You play with men 's souls as a cat with a mouse . " Diego shrugged . They waited their turn , maneuvering in circles . The water had turned rough in the narrow entrance , roiled by the passage of so many vessels , and the little boat rocked in the turbulence . A smoky , oily smell came from the cloudy water . But at last Diego steered cleanly between overloaded boats heading out again , threading between docks already crammed with ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing ready in the bow , mooring line coiled in his grasp . The dock they approached was deserted except for one last group of three men , hurrying to take their place in the rescue . Diego pointed . " There 's our man . " The man was average height , a little stocky of build , with a suggestion of muscles under a drab jacket , and a flat black cap worn at an angle on his head . His movements spoke of an easy sense of authority , the confidence of a man born to lead . he could have been a Devon Sea Dog , Drake thought , liking him for it . The throbbing underfoot stopped , and Drake tossed the mooring line . The man in the black cap caught it without fumbling . The boat bumped softly against the seaweed-slick stone . Another of Death 's angry bird-craft came swooping in . Drake heard the unmistakable sound of shot whistling past his ears , saw the fountains of dust as the shot hit dirt . The craft pulled up at the last minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the gray dawn . Death , it seemed , had brought many hellish marvels to the world since he had been gone . It pained him not at all to have lacked them in his time . He looked back at the little group , recognizing the haunted eyes of those who had seen too many battles , and that he understood . One had an arm in a makeshift sling , another leaned on a crutch , his foot a bloody stump . The man he had come to rescue seemed uninjured . " How many can you take ? " the man shouted over the noise of the retreating steel bird . Before Drake could answer , Diego spoke . " Sorry , guv . We 've come for just one . " " Then take the two injured , " the man shot back . " Between " em they 'll make your one ! " Drake frowned . The vessel was small but would suffice for five . " Mayhap - " " One , " Diego repeated . " Sir , " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . There 'll be another boat- " " Doubt it , guv , " Diego said . " We 're the end of the queue . " " More reason to load us and get away then ! " Diego suddenly leaned over the gap between the boat and the gray stone - impossibly far ! Drake thought - and seized the man 's arm , dragging him over the gunwale . And at the same time , Death 's steel bird dove out of the sky toward them again and the hail of shot rained down . The three of them fell in a heap in the cockpit . Her bow line unsecured , the little sailboat drifted away from the dock on the pull of the ebb tide . Diego recovered quickly and seized the tiller ; the rumbling that drove the boat forward started again , and Diego turned her in the narrow channel , heading back to open water . Drake dragged himself up on hands and knees to stare at the spot on the dock where this man had stood a moment before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger growled . " Take it easy , guv , " Diego said . " Before this war ends , there 'll be millions more like them . " " And shall your hunger be sated then ? " Drake asked with heat . " Nay . You must needs forgive my outburst . It nothing serves a man to be angered by a spirit ! " The man they had rescued stared at each of them in turn . he had dark , intense eyes that seemed to take the measure of a man . But he said nothing . " Ahoy the My Gal Mary ! " a voice called . Drake stared across water churning at the mouth of the harbor to a long , dark-painted ship , low in the water , a hull only , no sails . A sailor in a white cap stood on its deck , holding a metal cone to his lips . " Ahoy ! " Drake replied , cupping his hands to his mouth " Routes Z and X are out of commission , " the sailor said through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X. " " What 'll it be instead , mate ? " Diego called back . " Take route Y. " " Right-o ! Route Y 's it , then . " " You 're the tail end , " the sailor said . " Good luck ! " Drake shook his head . " What is this talk of letters ? " " It 's why you came , Skipper , " Diego said cheerfully . " The way home - and this old tub 's about to run out of petrol . " The rumbling beneath Drake 's feet sputtered and faded out . The My Gal Mary slowed , rocking in the choppy water . " You said it yourself once , Skipper . No one better than you at sailing . " The man they had rescued seemed to have recovered his composure . " Route Y 's more than twice as long as the best crossing . Eighty-seven miles , Dunkirk to Dover , instead of Route Z 's thirty-nine . If they 're sending us that way , the Hun must 've been busy last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drake said . " In my day we called him the Don . " " Different enemy , " Diego said . he leaned down to a locker under the cockpit seat and took out a rolled chart . " A bit more detailed than in your day , Skipper , but you ought a be able to make it out . " The Sun perched on the shoulder of the harbor buildings as Drake unrolled the chart and spread it on the little cabin 's roof . he stared at the mix of familiar and unfamiliar terms ; compass rose and fathoms , these he knew . The route Diego 's finger indicated traveled far to the north , where the already agitated waters of the Narrow Sea opened to the North Sea itself . There , he would have to turn west where the channel widened and the currents coming together fought for dominance . This small boat would be tossed and imperiled , not meant for such a watery battle . It would take much skill . Near the line showing the coast at Margate he saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego said when Drake 's finger paused on the symbol . " Top of the Goodwin Sands , remember them ? Another one there at the bottom . You could 've used a lightship out by the Spice Islands , eh , Skipper ? " He stared at Diego 's smiling face . How came he ever to think this malevolent spirit a friend ? " And after that , another treacherous stretch down to Dover , " Diego added . " In darkness , " Drake said thoughtfully . " The Sun will set before we reach Dover . So be it . I have sailed with less . " " I do n't know who you are , " the man they had rescued said levelly . " And I have a feeling I do n't want to know . But if you can get me back to England , I 'll be in your debt . " Drake looked up at the sky , still hazy but the fog almost gone . The freshening wind stung his cheek , carrying the scent of kelp and fish . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it had on that day of his glory aboard the Revenge , smashing the Don 's armada . His heart flooded with elation , - he was alive , and at sea . To how many men was given the boon to live again , even for only a day ? he had no doubt that Death would devour him once more when his task was completed . No matter the craft was small , the enemy not the one he had expected . England needed him . God willing , he would answer her need . " Stand ready to hoist sail , " he said . " And I shall command the helm ! " In the hours that followed , he knew a joy he had not known since he was a lad idling away the long summer days in Plymouth harbor in his first small cockleboat . The Mary was sweet-tempered as his own young wife had been , turning lightly with the wind and running hard and true over the gray water . On the horizon , he saw other ships , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he chuckled . If the Spaniard should see him now ! But he had always known it was not the size of the ship that counted , or the size of the fleet , but the size of a man 's heart . Guns spoke from the French coast as they passed , and he marveled at the heavy power of their voices . If he had but one like that , he thought , how much sooner the Don 's fortifications on the Spanish Main would have fallen to him ! he was not within the guns " reach for long . Some hours later , he saw the buoy that marked the northern tip of the route Diego had shown him . Here he turned the Mary and prepared to sail west ; waves slapped the bow as the little boat came about , and spray flew against his face . he was too far off the coast of the Low Countries for landmarks but needed no compass to tell him direction . he knew it by the light in the hazy sky and the wind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these waters and his skill in sailing must come into play to keep the boat heading west against strong currents that would push him now north , now south . The wind veered and the boat heeled over . At Drake 's nod , Diego eased the mainsheet , spilling wind out of the sail , and she righted . Softly , softly ! he told himself , old skills coming back ; too much heel and she would lose her speed . His main concern was the weather , for squalls raked the Narrow Sea without warning in summer . he squinted up at the sky but saw no threatening thunderheads , only an occasional Death 's bird droning its way across . Now he faced open sea , no companion ships to follow , no landmarks visible , only his hard-fought knowledge of this ill-tempered expanse of water . Diego sat in silence . The man - if he could in truth be named one - had lapsed into stillness till he seemed a stone carving of himself on some country church door , the hawk 's profile turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guest , making his way back from the bow where he had stood as the hours passed since they left the Flemish coast behind . " You are surefooted as any Devon Sea Dog , " Drake commented . The man 's lips curled up . " Spent a little time on the water as a boy . " There was an air of watchful ease about him that Drake found commendable . A good man to have beside one in the fight . What mighty struggle lay ahead of this stranger that Death had caused his rescue ? " I trust not this sky nor this water , " Drake said . " The Narrow Sea is surely the most perfidious on this round globe . " " I 'd keep that accolade for the Irish Channel , " the man said . " Eviltempered stretch ! " " You know Ireland ? " " Born there . Ulster . " " I served at her majesty 's pleasure in Ulster in my youth - a very long time ago ! " The man gazed steadily at him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small boat 's skipper . Then he shook his head but kept his own counsel . The Sun had passed its meridian when , behind them , Drake saw one lone ship , headed , as they were , for the English coast . he was glad for confirmation of his course , though he had not doubted it . " Mine ahead ! " Diego called suddenly . Diego pointed to a round black ball studded with knobs bobbing in the water . Drake pulled the tiller over hard so the little boat shuddered and the mainsail flapped , losing the wind and slowing . " What is it ? " " An invitation to die , " the stranger said dryly . " There 'll be more before we see Dover . " Drake fought the strong current that ran here , and they slipped cautiously past the death trap . From then on , his gaze swept the water ahead as well as the sky above for dangers he could not understand but trusted were there . Something pulsed through him as if his blood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served - though he had never been a man to drink to excess . Danger was a fine wine to bring a man to a fighting mood . he reveled in it . Another of Death 's traps revealed itself in the agitated waters . He steered the Mary cautiously past ; his breath catching in his chest as he did so as if he were alive and had anything to lose . The man he had rescued , he reminded himself , had a life to lose - and England 's future with him . Whatever that might be . A sudden low rumbling explosion reached his ears . he whirled to see the ship he had noticed earlier upended and sinking fast in the churning water . " Hard to avoid the buggers when they float so low in the water , " Diego said . " But you 're one man as can do it , Skipper . " " We 'll have our revenge . " The stranger 's face was tight with anger . Diego grinned . " Oh , yes indeed , guv ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding coming to him . Another of Death 's birds swooped over their heads , and remembering the damage wrought by the one in the French harbor , he feared time 's hourglass had run out . " Spitfire ! " the man he had rescued shouted against the noise . " One of ours ! " " Dead I may be , " Drake muttered through clenched teeth . " Yet this borrowed heart beats like a drum ! " The wind gained force and filled the Mary 's sails . It was a very long crossing for such a little boat , yet she flew over the waves as only the best of his ships had ever done . The wind was ever his friend . " Too bad we ca n't take the shortest crossing , " the stranger said . " Dover would 've been in sight already . " Drake looked at him . " Think you I can not find my way ? " The man looked steadily back . " Can you ? " In answer , Drake took up the chart Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the pieces to sail a while on the air then dropped them in the sea . Diego laughed . The stranger did n't flinch . " Now what ? " No one in the world understood better the art of sailing . For this he had been born , and for this he had come back again . And had he not chased the Spaniard 's armada through these very waters ? Surely , their secret paths were etched on his soul , every twist or cunning turn by which the current made fools of unwary sailors . The run of current was all he needed to know to find his way across a watery wilderness . At last in the gathering dusk of evening , he sighted a light blinking at the northern edge of the Goodwin Sands just off the coast at Margate , where he remembered many an unwary sailor-Spaniard and Englishman both - had gone aground . " The North Goodwin Lightship , " the stranger said . " Good sailing , Skipper ! " Drake nodded but did not reply . How many brave souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands ? Yet Death always took them in the end . He turned the Mary a. last time to head south between the dangerous sands and the coast as full dark crept over the water . Then something - a breath of wind from a new direction - a spatter of rain light as a feather 's touch - gave warning . " Reef the mainsail ! " Diego went to the mast and hurriedly followed Drake 's order . The sudden squall hit with a wet slap to his face and the Mary heeled over recklessly . It was all he could do to hold on to the tiller . The wind confused the seas till they ran in all directions at once , and he could not save the bow from slamming into the crest of a wave . The man he had rescued clung to the gunwale , still holding the mainsheet in one hand . Diego clutched hold of the mast against being washed overboard , though why Death must needs take measures to avoid death he did not know . Drake corrected the angle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regaining her course as the wave passed harmlessly beneath . He opened all his sea sense to the wind 's direction . If he could not stay hard on the wind , the hungry sea would sweep them right onto the sandbar . The Mary was heeling hard , waves rushing in over her low side , threatening to capsize her . All three braced themselves on the high side of the cockpit . A heavy rain pelted down , drenching them . Exhilaration flooded through his veins . " Hold fast ! " he told his crew . " We shall make port yet . " Every seventh wave was the one to knock a boat down , but he would not let waves defeat him this close to safe harbor . In the midst of his struggle with weather , he glanced at the stranger . The man had the jib sheet firmly in hand , his mouth set in a tight line . " Doubt you yet that the Narrow Sea is the more treacherous ? " Drake shouted . The man shook his head , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered them heavier than before , and Drake fought to keep control , the knuckles of his borrowed hands white with strain . Yet he found this body knew to keep its balance on a tossing deck , and he silently thanked the mariner whose name he did not know , commending his soul to the Lord . Then as swiftly as it had come upon them , the squall departed . The Mary settled and resumed her gentle progress and Drake felt the hard drumming in his heart soften and fade . He stretched his neck , releasing tension , and caught the look of cunning that passed across Diego 's dark face . Diego showed no sign of strain or tiredness . Drake nodded toward the mast , and Diego went forward to release the reef and raise the sail to its full height . Soon , the lightship at the southern edge of the Goodwin Sands blinked out of the darkness . The danger was past . He adjusted course to sail east-southeast , under the familiar white cliffs of the Kentish coast , luminous in starlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the man said , flexing stiff fingers . " And the chance to fight again . " " Right , guv , " Diego said cheerfully . " Go get the buggers ! " Drake watched the looming walls of the port of Dover , far larger and busier than he remembered it . His mind raced . The task he had come back to do was completed - though he had no idea what indeed it was that he had done . He did not understand the conflict England was engaged in , or the enemy , or why this man 's life was important . But war , it seemed , had not changed much since his day . Good men still lost their lives , and trickery still prevailed too often . Death sailed forever with those who risked all for their country 's sake , and he cared naught for right or wrong , only for the harvest of souls . Toward midnight , the boat bumped against the dock ; the harbor was almost dark , what lanterns there were seemed shaded to cut even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better lit ! " he said . " Do n't want to guide the Hun to bomb the place , Skipper , " Diego said . Diego jumped out and prepared to secure the dock line . Drake watched , empty at the last . Death , the gentleman , had kept his word , bringing him back when England needed him . Yet now the day was over and his own voyage , becalmed on the Defiance in Caribbean waters , must be completed . Soon his soul must unfurl its sails to the wind . God willing , this day had righted the balance of the scales that weighed his life . " So good a day , " he said . Diego 's eyes were fixed on the man they had rescued . Drake weighed the intensity of that gaze and knew a sudden kinship with Death 's next soldier . He saw as though on the stage of a London playhouse , the alarms and retreats of the battles this man would face , and the carnage Death would reap in his wake . " Good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drake sighed . " There must be a beginning of any great matter - " " But it 's the continuing to the end until it 's thoroughly finished that yields the true glory , " the stranger finished for him . He stared at the man who somehow knew words he had spoken in another place and so long ago . " I 'm in your debt , sir . " The stranger stood on the quay , his hand held out to Drake . Drake took the hand . " I fear the bargain may not prove worth the price . " " I know who you are , " the man said quietly . " I 've heard the legends . I just never thought .... " " That you might become one ? " " Ready to go , guv ? " Diego said . " I 'll just tag along - Digger 's the name . You look like you could use a batman . " " God go with you , whoever you are , " Drake said . " You will need His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis . Bernard Montgomery . " Montgomery 's hand slipped through Drake 's grasp like water . Drake turned to the man he had known on so many perilous voyages . " I always keep my word , " Death said . The wind rose , commanding him away .
