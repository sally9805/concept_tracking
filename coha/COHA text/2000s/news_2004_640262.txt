<p> MEMPHIS , Tenn. - The Mississippi River may be awash in more myth , but this city perched on its eastern bank swirls with powerful currents of its own , including some of the central events - and players - in America 's musical history . <p> July 5 marks the 50th anniversary of Elvis Presley recording ' That 's All Right ( Mama ) ' at Sun Studios . Music tourists take note : Starting in May , Memphis will host an array of events celebrating Presley 's first commercial record and the seismic cultural shift that followed . <p> But for all his influence , Presley is just one of a staggering lineup of musicians bred or nurtured here . <p> And why not ? Memphis is the crossroads of American vernacular music : blues , country , soul , gospel , jazz , R &B,; rockabilly and the all-encompassing hybrid known as rock ' n ' roll . <p> Cotton might once have ruled in Memphis - the lobby of the legendary Peabody Hotel is considered the northernmost point of the Mississippi Delta - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a century . <p> Along with its famous swivel-hipped son , Memphis has served as home or launching pad to W.C. Handy , B.B. King , Jerry Lee Lewis , Howlin ' Wolf , Johnny Cash , Al Green , Otis Redding , Booker T. and the MGs , Rufus and Carla Thomas , Carl Perkins , Roy Orbison and Ike Turner . <p> Quite a roster , but it barely scratches the surface . <p> ' There 's just something in the air in Memphis , ' says Tad Pierson , who offers music-oriented tours in his 1955 Cadillac sedan . ' Everywhere you turn , you hear music and see musical history . It 's an amazing city . ' <p> For one thing , it 's probably the only city in America where 90 percent of the population knows how to clap on the two-beat . The music sprang from a confluence of rural and urban lifestyles , mingled ethnicities and cultures , all underpinned by waterborne commerce . The Mississippi was an artery that allowed itinerant musicians to come and go , absorbing and dispensing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee 's largest city . It also is a musical Lourdes . Although the most high-profile shrine is Presley 's Graceland , pilgrims also can visit Sun Studios , Soulsville U.S.A. ( the Stax Records museum ) , Beale Street and the Memphis Rock ' n ' Soul Museum . <p> The latter is a stunning - and deeply moving - musical primer whose centerpiece is a permanent collection of memorabilia and interpretive exhibits from the Smithsonian Institution . It 's a great place to start a tour of musical Memphis . <p> Housed just south of Beale Street in the Gibson guitar factory ( which offers tours ) , the Rock ' n ' Soul museum puts the region 's music in its cultural context . While you can goggle at the eye-candy - Johnny Cash 's black frock coat and the piano Ike Turner used to pound out ' Rocket 88 , ' considered the first rock ' n ' roll song - you will see re-creations of sharecroppers ' homes , learn about the Delta economy and get a sense of the complex racial relationships that proved so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The music did n't spring out of thin air ; it had a milieu , and the museum captures this in interactive exhibits rendered with style , savvy and real scholarship . <p> ' Visitors here tend to know their history and really like to go in-depth , ' says museum staffer Paul Blanchard . ' We tell people to take their time . We had two women in from Cape Town , South Africa , the other day . One woman danced her way through . ' <p> Flip a coin to decide your next stop . <p> A logical one - and obligatory to boot - is Sun Studios . Housed in a plain brick building a moderate walk from downtown Memphis , the recording studio offers daily tours on the half-hour . <p> Sun was founded by Sam Phillips , a Memphis visionary who in the early 1950s dreamed of translating his beloved blues into music that could cross the color line - even if the musicians playing it could not . The man who recorded Howlin ' Wolf and Ike Turner would find that music in Presley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' My Happiness ' as a gift for his mom . <p> A year later history was made , as Presley - backed by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black - recorded Arthur ' Big Boy ' Crudup 's ' That 's All Right . ' <p> The American cultural landscape was all shook up , and the kid from nearby Lauderdale Courts , a housing project now being converted into condos , was on his way . <p> Sun remains a working studio . U2 has recorded here - you can , too , for $ 75 an hour - and the original microphone Elvis and company used stands in the middle of the floor . Yes , you can sing into it . No , you ca n't kiss or lick it , though the guides swear that people try . An ' X ' marks where Elvis stood . <p> From Sun , head to Graceland . The Sun-Graceland axis is a poignant reminder of joyous beginnings and sad ends . <p> To reach the estate , head down Elvis Presley Boulevard , a rather depressing thoroughfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 for $ 100,000 . It 's where he died 20 years later , undone by excesses both dietary and pharmaceutical . The mansion is oddly modest in scale . <p> The tour is a Memphis must , authoritatively mounted albeit rigorously controlled . Park across the street and take a shuttle through the distinctive gates ( Jerry Lee Lewis once showed up there drunk , armed and demanding to see Elvis , who declined ) . <p> Hit the button on your audio guide and make your way through a time capsule of stunning memorabilia , cool footage from Elvis home movies and some truly garish interior decorating . Of special note is a canopied bed that looks as if it was stitched from the hides of a dozen albino llamas . <p> You can visit the rec room where Elvis shot pool , the kitchen where his cook whipped up fried-banana sandwiches and the wild Jungle Room , one of the house 's numerous dens . You can see part of his gun collection , various uniforms from his Army years , karate outfits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Muddy . Across the street is a collection of his vehicles and the ' Lisa Marie , ' the King 's private jet . <p> Graceland is both a reminder of Presley 's genius and testament to the fact that his life , at least apart from the music , was one of arrested adolescence . Yet Elvis lives . <p> Soul shrine <p> From Graceland , head to another Memphis shrine : Stax Records . <p> During the 1960s , Stax was home to an extraordinary group of musicians and songwriters : Redding , the Thomases , Wilson Pickett , Isaac Hayes , David Porter , the Mar-Keys , and Booker T. and the MGs , the Stax house band that cranked hits in its own right . <p> Stax , housed in an old movie theater on McLemore Avenue , was remarkable for its integration . Black and white musicians worked alongside each other for equal pay and glory . Redding 's signature ' Dock of the Bay ' is a case in point . The song was composed by Redding and Steve Cropper , a lanky white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Today the studio functions as a museum , operating as Soulsville U.S.A. <p> But Memphis music is n't a cluster of blue notes trapped in amber . Rap and hip-hop thrive alongside the city 's more traditional sounds . <p> ' We 've got a huge hip-hop scene here , partly because of our central location but mainly because of our ability to nurture and inspire talent , ' said Rey Flemings , president of the Memphis and Shelby County Music Commission . ' Our big thing is making sure the rest of the world hears us . ' <p> Three weeks ago , Flemings moderated a panel discussion at Beale Street 's New Daisy Theatre , where folks like Chris Rayas talked to hip-hop artists about marketing their music . <p> ' We 're talking about how to use digital technology and the Internet to get the music out there , ' said Rayas , a Memphis transplant whose business is creating online sites for streaming video and music . ' The recording industry has changed , and this is the future . ' <p> Still , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . There are n't really 500 music-related historical markers here - it just seems that way . <p> One marks radio station WDIA 's old home on Union Avenue , just up from the Peabody Hotel . Fifty years ago it was one of the most important black-owned radio stations in the country . Singer Rufus Thomas deejayed there - the first black deejay to play Elvis . When a kid named Riley King stepped off the bus from Indianola , Miss. , he walked into WDIA and landed a job spinning records . A few years later he had reinvented himself as B.B. King , blues titan . <p> Although WDIA 's marquee remains , the station has moved ; these days it 's owned by Clear Channel , the radio conglomerate . <p> King himself remains a Memphis presence . His B.B. King Blues Club on Beale Street showcases local and national acts , and the big man himself plays the room on occasion - always with his famed Gibson 335 , the guitar he calls ' Lucille . ' <p> Not the old Beale Street <p> Beale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night - but it bears little resemblance to the place where W.C. Handy wrote the first transcriptions of the song form that became known as the blues . <p> During the 1920s , Beale was the capital of black Memphis and the region dubbed the Mid-South . Although the street has morphed into a tourist mecca , remnants of its wide-open history remain . The ancient neon sign for the King 's Palace Cafe survives ; today the place functions as a blues club - one of a dozen or so on Beale . <p> ' Memphis really is a lifestyle , ' says J.D. Westmoreland , a local musician . ' It 's a great town to make music in . ' <p> Among the dozens of bands calling Memphis home are The Dempseys , a rockabilly trio that relocated here six years ago from Tacoma , Wash . <p> ' Memphis is just great , ' said Brad Birkedahl , the group 's guitarist and vocalist . ' There 's so much music here and such a rich history . ' <p> An evening in early April found The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a packed house . The moves were vintage , too : Joe Fick rode his upright bass like a crazed sailor hanging from a ship 's prow , while Birkedahl flung notes - and drops of sweat - at warp speed . <p> Toward midnight , as he pulled on a cigarette before his last set , Birkedahl mingled with fans from as far away as England and pondered his adopted city 's legacy . ' Memphis really is music central , ' he said . ' We might have the most musically knowledgeable population anywhere , and the musicians are real tight with each other . ' <p> Not all the music is secular . Memphis is in the Bible Belt 's heart , so black and white gospel abounds in area churches . Soul giant Al Green is an ordained minister these days , and many Sundays find him in the pulpit of Full Gospel Tabernacle on Hale Road . He preaches , sings and leads a magnificent choir . <p> But musicians are n't the only performers crowds flock to see . <p> No Memphis visit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always will see the downtown landmark 's most famous guests shaking a tail feather . <p> These would be the famed Peabody ducks . Back in the 1930s , one of the hotel 's owners decided after a night of bourbon that it would be great fun to replace the wooden decoys in the lobby fountain with live mallards . <p> Meant as a one-time joke , the Peabody staff arrived the next morning to find hotel guests enthralled and charmed by the ducks . <p> A tradition was born . Every morning and afternoon , a ' duck master ' in red blazer escorts the ducks to and from the fountain in a grand tongue-in-cheek ceremony . <p> On a recent afternoon , as the Peabody bar filled with evening imbibers , marching music began piping . The birds exited the pond , swaying up the carpet as flashbulbs popped and fans applauded . <p> In Memphis , even the ducks have rhythm . <p> William Porter is The Post 's deputy arts and entertainment editor .  --  <p> If you go <p> Memphis is about a two-hour flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dining and entertainment options . <p> SLEEPS <p> Downtown Memphis offers the easiest access to the city 's sights , but you also can opt to stay near Graceland . <p> The Peabody Hotel <p> 800-732-2639. 149 Union Ave .
