So much for gangsters or communists infiltrating Hollywood . The real invisible menace turns out to be scientists . <p> " Just a sign of the modern times  --  the science has to be there , " says director Roland Emmerich , whose end-of-the-world film , 2012 , opens in November . " We are all looking for great themes out there , and science has those . " <p> Audiences agree . <p> Knowing , Nicolas Cage 's apocalyptic science thriller , surprised critics by topping the box office with $24.8 million in ticket sales over the weekend . Angels &amp; Demons star Tom Hanks last month toured Europe 's CERN atom-smashing facility , which also stars in the antimatter mystery movie premiering May 15 . <p> And a spate of other science-themed flicks arrives this year as well . James Cameron 's alien world of Avatar opens in December , and Sony 's animated inventor comedy , Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs , opens in September . <p> " It turns out a lot of people in Hollywood think science is cool , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Los Angeles-based outreach office of the venerable National Academy of Sciences . <p> The exchange , which formally opened in November , pairs up films and shows in development with scientists . Its goal is to get the science on the screen straight , the latest example of science 's mind-meld ( to use some Star Trek lingo ) with the popular imagination . <p> " Writers and directors have discovered there is a higher tolerance , maybe even an interest or a demand , for better science , " says Angels &amp; Demons director Ron Howard , who worked with CERN scientists on the film 's depiction of the lab . " Audiences are getting smarter by the minute . " <p> On the small screen , shows such as CBS The Big Bang Theory and CSI : Crime Scene Investigation are undoing the legacy of Star Trek 's pointy-eared Mr. Spock by making scientists look almost cool , says media scholar David Kirby of the United Kingdom 's University of Manchester . " We are in a golden age of science on television , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , try to get science right , says Kirby , a former academic biologist . " Science gives these shows certainty in uncertain times . Even if science , in reality , is all about uncertainty . " <p> It came from outer space <p> Says sociologist Wesley Shrum of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge , " Science in entertainment is n't anything new . " A Trip to the Moon , the 14-minute silent movie regarded as the first science-fiction film , was a hit after its 1902 release . The Lost World in 1925 featured dinosaurs trying to eat scientists and stomping city dwellers , almost seven decades before Jurassic Park . <p> " Movies change to reflect the society around them , and the way science appears certainly reflects that , " says astronomer and blogger Phil Plait . In the past century , scientists went from somewhat remote heroes in films , such as 1943 's Madame Curie , to more sinister figures in the Cold War , such as the title character in 1964 's Dr. Strangelove , to more human characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contact . Of course , mad scientists have always been popular , from 1931 's Frankenstein to today 's Fox show Fringe , blessed with its own nutty professor who works in a basement lab . <p> Fringe aside , " the scientists you see today are not Mr. Spock . They 're human , and that 's a real change , " Plait says , pointing to TV shows such as The Big Bang Theory . " Even if they are depicted as uber-geeks , they are still interesting people you 'd probably like . " <p> Jurassic Park in 1993 " made the biggest turn " in Hollywood 's interest in science , Emmerich says . The dinosaur-cloning science was part of the film 's appeal , a discovery that raised the credibility requirements for entertainment , he says . Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001 : A Space Odyssey had bumped up science 's profile , he says , but reasonable science has been a bottom-line requirement only in the past two decades . <p> " We really noticed it doing Apollo 13 , " released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its first years , and Howard and others were struck by its readiness to use medical jargon , much of it meaningless to the audience , to add authenticity to the story . That helped persuade Apollo 13 's writers to keep the NASA lingo in the film , which " helped make it more authentic , " Howard says . <p> A focus on ' credible science <p> " Every major film and TV show today has a science consultant , " says Kirby , author of the forthcoming Labcoats in Hollywood ( MIT Press ) , who has studied the steady increase in the number of science advisers from the dawn of film to today . <p> The big change today is the involvement of science advisers from the beginning of a show 's production , Kirby says . " In the past , producers would cold-call universities for advice on how to fix an already-written script , " he says . " Now you have scientists help maintain a logical consistency to the science , even if it 's unreal , throughout . " <p> Says Caltech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films get the equations right , and I think audiences pick up on credible science . " <p> His favorite science movie is last year 's comic-book adaptation Iron Man , " because it has a long sequence of experiments and ideas not working out or blowing up in the hero 's face , " Carroll says . " That 's the kind of science I 'm familiar with , trial and error , things never quite working out as easy as you hope . " <p> Shows rarely have time to get to the real meat of the scientific process : testing ideas with experiments , Plait says . And scientists too often , in his view , com- plain about little mistakes , missing the broader benefits that a positive depiction of science brings to the profession . <p> " OK , we see telescopes stuffed into crowded rooms , but that 's a trivial thing , " he says . " Entertainment is supposed to entertain , but good science can make stories better , throw up roadblocks , make plots more interesting and involving . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minnesota physicist James Kakalios , who not only helped cook up a quasi-science explanation for the Dr. Manhattan superhero ( a quantum-physics-altering blue man in shorts played by Billy Crudup ) , but also discussed the psychology of researchers with filmmakers . <p> The success of March of the Penguins in 2006 has revitalized the nature documentary field as well , a mainstay of science entertainment , says Jean-Francois Camilleri of Disneynature in Paris , which premieres nationwide the nature documentary Earth on April 22 , Earth Day . " A lot of the advances in film allow us to shoot films we never could imagine before , " Camilleri says , pointing to lightweight cameras and faster computer editing . <p> Some of those same advances enable special effects that almost demand help from scientists to explain , Emmerich says . " Audiences are jaded and cynical these days . If they see something that is not credible , they will shut it off . " <p> So how good is the science in today 's films and shows ? <p> " Occasionally , you will get a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kirby says . One problem is that sitting at a lab bench piping cells into glassware is n't all that entertaining , he adds . " For the most part , audiences want the answers quickly . " <p> ' It ca n't all be science <p> " There still has to be that fantastic element . It ca n't be all science , " says Emmerich , whose 2004 film , The Day After Tomorrow , featured an instant Ice Age that climate scientists say stretched past the tipping point of reality . " We had a real scientific worry , and we just packed it into a few days instead of decades or centuries , " he says . <p> More broadly , how science appears in entertainment can change how people see scientific problems , says Plait . The 1998 film Deep Impact featured some shaky science in its plot to divert a massive asteroid from Earth with nuclear bombs , he notes , but is widely credited by astronomers with raising public awareness of the threat from " Near Earth " asteroids and helping secure funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representations of science can significantly impact public understanding , " for better and for worse , Kirby says . He views 2000 's Mission to Mars as " harmful , " perpetuating a bogus idea in the public mind because the film depicted as real the geological feature known as the Face on Mars , which actually is an optical illusion . <p> " Who knows ? The trend toward science in entertainment may fizzle , " Kirby says . " But I would argue that it is here to stay . The heavy focus on science in films and TV has been cyclical , but always there . People only think it is new . " <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
