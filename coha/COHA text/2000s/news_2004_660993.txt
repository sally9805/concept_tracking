<p> Emil Pitkin took a lot of flak for his decision to switch from a coed school to one for boys . " You 're going where ? " his friends asked in disbelief . <p> " Boys ' schools are an unnatural environment for a young man , " adults told him . " The world is full of girls , so you might as well get used to them now . " <p> But Emil , who lives in Sharon , Mass. , and is originally from St. Petersburg , had made up his mind . The scholarly eighth grader was headed to one of the most respected boys ' schools in North America , The Roxbury Latin School , in Boston 's West Roxbury , and nothing could stop him . <p> Now a junior , the remarkably self-assured Emil has no regrets . " Sometimes I think I might have had more fun with girls around , " he says . " But then I remind myself that I 'm in school to learn , first and foremost . " <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , for boys anyway , this has n't always been the case . Whereas the gender gap favored boys not too long ago , girls now outshine boys in just about every academic arena . <p> Girls are earning better grades , scoring higher on their SATs , and taking home a majority of America 's bachelor 's degrees . <p> In their efforts to keep up , many boys are floundering . In recent years , the National Assessment of Educational Progress has flagged boys ' increasing disengagement from academics . And recent statistics show boys are more likely to repeat a grade , to require special ed , or to be diagnosed with either attention-deficit disorder or hyperactivity . <p> Some say this is the result of schools that cater to a feminine ideal - sitting still in tidy rows , for instance , listening quietly to a teacher 's lecture , and taking immaculate notes . Many girls can ace these tasks , experts say , but boys will often struggle with them because their learning styles are different . <p> Boys learn best when they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers in a lighthearted , joking manner . " There 's simply a tempo and a sequence to the way boys learn that is not better or worse but different , " says Rick Hawley , head of the University School , the largest private boys ' school in America . <p> It used to be that people thought single-sex schools were " good for girls and not for boys . " Now that perception is changing . As the classroom , curriculum , and culture can be tailored to male needs , schools that are exclusively for boys are now being looked at more closely as a viable alternative and as a possible remedy for boys ' much-publicized academic woes . <p> " I have never been more certain that boys ' schools are the way to go given what boys are dealing with now , " Mr. Hawley says . <p> Research shows that boys make academic gains when educated in the company of their own sex . A recent study in Australia , for example , looked at six years of test scores for 270,000 students and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 to 22 percentiles higher than peers in coeducational settings . And researchers at Cambridge University in England found that " using single-sex groups was a significant factor in establishing a school culture that would raise educational achievement . " <p> In America , girls ' schools have been studied more closely in past decades , so research on single-sex schools for boys is scant and mostly anecdotal . <p> On the campuses of Roxbury Latin and another prestigious independent school for boys , the Belmont Hill School in Belmont , Mass. , students , teachers , and administrators recently shared their views on why a school for boys makes sense in today 's world . <p> Less distraction , a comfort level that allows one to ask " stupid questions " in class without embarrassment , and an ability to joke around with teachers in ways one might not with girls present are advantages all parties touched on . But perhaps the advantage cited most often is a culture that allows boys to forget societal pressures to be macho . At boys ' schools , advocates say , students learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This environment frees up boys from typecasting and stereotyping of what it means to be male , " says Rick Melvoin , head of Belmont Hill School . This allows them , he explains , to focus their energies more on academics and relationships with teachers , and to develop themselves in ways they might not in a coed setting . <p> For instance , Mr. Melvoin says , a boy at Belmont Hill is n't considered any less masculine if he prefers singing in the glee club or performing in the school play over athletics . <p> Greg O'Connell , a Belmont Hill senior , would agree . " I am doing acting now , " he says . " I might think twice about that if I were in a coed school . " <p> As his friend Dan Neczypor puts it : " This place encourages risk . " <p> That 's not to say that there is n't some name-calling that goes on at boys ' schools if a student acts in a way that 's considered girlish . " If we hear one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl , we 'll stop him in his tracks , " says Debbie Callahan , dean of the faculty at Belmont Hill School . " By junior year , they know better . " <p> At Roxbury Latin , art teacher Brian Buckley feels he 's giving boys a gift by helping them to realize they can create a pleasing work on canvas , in clay , or with pen and ink . " At the coed school where I used to teach , girls took the lead in art , " he says . " But here , boys are not intimidated . Many top athletes excel in art at Roxbury Latin . " <p> Roxbury Latin science teacher Kate Chappell works hard at helping boys to express themselves . " I disagree with the idea that boys are innately stoic , " she says . " From the moment students arrive , all of us here try to help them feel so comfortable , safe , and loved that they open up . Within two months , we 've gotten to them . " <p> It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can address boys ' emotional needs , says Michael Obel-Omia , English teacher and admissions director at Roxbury Latin . " Boys are hurting these days , " he says . " As a teacher , you have to convey to boys that you love them . Then they will perform well . Boys do n't learn subjects , they learn teachers . " <p> One of the most important qualities a teacher can bring to a boys ' school is patience , says Kerry Brennan , headmaster of Collegiate School in New York , who will soon take the reins at Roxbury Latin . <p> " In a boys ' school , " he says , " boys are given time to grow up at their own pace , whereas in a coed setting , girls ' earlier and more advanced clocks define everything . " <p> Of course , not everyone is a fan of boys ' schools . Some feel the environment is unnatural and that it will foster boys who are socially awkward with girls . Belmont Hill 's Dean Callahan admits she is " a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes with girls in college . <p> But most boys interviewed shrugged off the notion that the adjustment will be tough . Others laugh and say that the biggest myth of a boys ' school is that it 's a kind of " monastery . " Both Roxbury Latin and Belmont Hill students see girls from nearby independent girls ' schools at dances and other jointly held events . And they usually produce plays together , which some say - with a wink - gives them that extra incentive to try out for a show . <p> Dr. Michael Thompson , a child and family therapist , author , and staff psychologist at Belmont Hill , is thrilled that boys ' schools are being rediscovered . <p> " I am not ready to say they are the panacea and that we should return to entirely single-sex schools , " he says . " But in a boys ' school , learning is a male thing , and there 's a danger in coed schools that learning will be only a girl thing . Boys ' schools are hard-working places , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ribbing , and nobody is impressed by a macho attitude . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
