PRESSED SNUGLY AGAINST COLORADO 'S BORDER WITH NEW MEXICO is the bittersweet land of the Southern Utes . Like the entire universe and every creature in it , this is a work in progress . And a very fine work it is . Splashing , snow-melt rivers follow serpentine paths through broad valleys where willows weep not and lime-green cottonwoods are crowned with shimmering rainbows . Hardy pion and juniper dot the crests of wind-sculpted mesas . Between these long sandstone benches are dark , silent canyons where spirits who tarry in this world keep company with other shadows . Presiding above all are the cloud-shrouded peaks , blue-green with spruce and fir . During the frigid Moon of Dead Leaves Falling , the mountain 's round shoulders are sprinkled with flakes of aspen gold . But this is a fleeting time ; soon their heads will be capped in purest white that does not vanish until June is well past middle age . The early Spaniards named these heights after that beloved disciple who inquired of Jesu Cristo : " Lord , who is it among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard still whispers in the winds . From age to age , the mountains remain ... and the betrayal is repeated . THE RED-TAILED hawk circles high over the creation . Far below , at the yawning mouth of Caon del Espiritu , the bird 's clear eye spies a tiny silver speck . It is the body of an antique house trailer . The dwelling has stout steel ribs , aluminum skin that can be sliced with a pocket knife , small windows where an old woman 's wrinkled face can sometimes be glimpsed . This is where the Ute elder spends the twilight of her life . By the path of the hawk , her home is an almost equal distance from Arboles , Bayfield , and Ignacio-which is to say about ninety-five furlongs . This is a very considerable distance for one who must depend upon others for transportation . Though she is far from civilization , Daisy Perika dwells close to the heart of God . Considering her many sins , this might seem unlikely-and indeed is beyond all human understanding . If she is neither sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman 's years have pressed hard , molding her into a leathery bag of brittle bones and bitter memories . Loss and pain have made her greedy and fearful . The elder 's tongue is sharp , sometimes vulgar . Despite her many well-meant promises to the kindly pastor of St. Ignatius Catholic Church , the shaman has not given up her clandestine conversations with the dwarf-spirit who dwells in the badger hole . Daisy might well commit theft or even murder if there was no fear of being caught and punished . The poor old soul is fond of only six of her fellow human beings , and barely able to tolerate the rest . Under these circumstances it can not be expected that Daisy would keep the First Commandment . One who finds her neighbors hateful can not truly love God . But that Lover of Souls adores the crabby old woman . And grants her grace upon grace , not the least of which she deserves . Therein lies the heart of the deepest , sweetest mystery . DAISY PERIKA pushed herself up from the straight-backed chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniature window . Hands resting on the sill , she looked toward the U-shaped formation called Cougar 's Tail . Not that she could see the entire curl of the rocky ridge-Daisy could barely make out the mouth of the Canyon of the Spirits . The atmosphere was a stinging swirl of sand and grit that peppered against the trailer like brown sleet . All night , she had slept fretfully . All morning long , the wind had sputtered and coughed , pausing now and then to gather its raspy breath . With the greater of the gusts , the walls of the trailer rattled and buckled as though the sixty-year-old rivets might pop . Moreover , the entire structure rocked back and forth . And squeaked . And groaned . It was maddening . There was this singular blessing-the usually solitary woman was not alone . Charlie Moon , who had arrived with the sunrise , was seated at her kitchen table . The tribal investigator had not said a word since finishing his scrambled eggs and chili-spiked posole . His whole attention was focused on a tattered copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scowl at her nephew . As if he was responsible for the weather . " This wind is going to blow us over into Conejos County . " He grunted , turned a page . She made a rude , spitting sound . " I can feel the sand between my teeth . " Charlie Moon muttered something unintelligible . The old woman pulled a woolen shawl more tightly around stooped shoulders . " It 's cold enough out there to freeze your shadow to the ground . " And not much better inside . " I think the furnace is about to give up the ghost-or maybe I 'm low on propane . " " And the cow 's gone dry and the hens wo n't lay . " He winked at her over the newspaper . " Other than that , it 's a fine day . " Daisy tried hard not to smile ; the effort made her face ache . " Anybody who thinks this is a fine day has maggot stew for brains . " He folded the tribal newspaper . " There 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home with me . " The tribal elder shook her head . " No-thank-you . Every time I go to your ranch , something bad happens . And if I 'm not here , thieves might break into my house . " Moon glanced around her sparsely furnished home , wondered what anyone would want to steal . Miles from the nearest neighbor , this was no place for an elderly person to live . He repeated the offer he made on almost every visit . " I could fix you up a bedroom at the ranch headquarters . " As an enticement , he added , " It 'd be nice and warm . " " All your bedrooms are on the second floor , " she snapped . " I 'm too old and brittle-boned to be climbing up stairs . " She followed his gaze around her kitchen . " Besides , home is where your stuff is . " " I could fix you up a room downstairs . " " Where , in a closet ? " Moon , who had been thinking of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need my closets . But there 's a little pantry just off the dining room . It 's got a forty-watt lightbulb . We could clear out some of the canned goods so you could have a shelf for your stuff . It 'd be nice and cozy . " She brushed this joke away with the wave of a hand . " Do n't you have to be getting home ? " The sharp-tongued woman immediately regretted these words . The rancher consulted his wristwatch . " Now that you mention it . " Moon 's eye followed his aged aunt as she made her way across the kitchen . " Anything I can do for you before I go ? " " I can take care of myself . " The shaman placed a palm on the door of the chugging refrigerator , as if she could feel what was inside . " But when you come back , bring me a dozen eggs . Two pounds of bacon . Pound of pork sausage . Can of lard . Sliced bread . Coffee . Milk . Sugar . Butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who knew her grocery list by heart , got up from the table . He was not able to stretch to his full seven-foot height inside the trailer , and the black Stetson would go on after he stepped outside onto the rickety pine porch . " I may not be back for a week or two . I 'll have some groceries brought over from Ignacio . And I 'll get somebody from La Plata Propane to have a look at your furnace . " He gave her a hug . THE OLD woman watched her nephew drive away . Cold coils of loneliness tightened around her heart . Maybe this time I should have gone with him . Chapter Two EVENING HAS COME TO THE HIGH COUNTRY . THE OVERWORKED winds heave a last sigh before settling into the canyons for a night 's rest . Dust and sand drift slowly down to earth . Twilight grows old , dusky gray ... withers into inky blackness . One by one , sharp prickles of starlight burn holes through the outer darkness . A yellow-eyed owl calls once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pion 's gnarly shoulder , wings hopefully toward a perch on the pale crescent moon . Night after night she does this . Now a taut stillness occupies the land . The unseen audience is hushed , expectant . Waiting for the velvet curtain to be drawn , the darkling players to appear onstage and prance before the backdrop of mesa , mist , and cloud . WEARY AS she was , the old woman was also restless . Daisy Perika turned onto one side , found no comfort there , rolled onto the other . She tried lying on her back , staring at an invisible ceiling . The tired old soul listened to the clock 's metallic tickety-tick . She heard the recurring call of a distant owl , the sound of something small scurrying across the roof of the trailer . A squirrel , she thought . The elder closed her eyes , tried hard to find sleep . She could not , and finally gave up the search . Moments later , Sleep found her . A LUMINOUS balloon inflated with soul-stuff , the dreamer felt herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Over there , jutting up between Snake Canyon and Caon del Espiritu , were the familiar stone formations on Three Sisters Mesa . She was drifting higher now , above the snowy peaks of the San Juans , moving rapidly toward that distant place where the sun would appear to bring a new day . As if covered by a multitude of unblinking eyes , the shaman saw everything-above and below , toward all four points of the compass . A thin sliver of moon hung over the earth , as if suspended on an invisible cord . There was a lake to the south ; it was shaped like a leg bent at the knee . Starlight reflected off the glassy waters . There were headlights of automobiles , inching ever so slowly along unseen highways . And then , in a twinkling , the mountains were far behind her . A flash of blue-green light , and the sun was well above the horizon-but not as she had seen it appear on thirty thousand mornings . The incandescent sphere was just there . Not moving . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling , falling . Daisy Perika was on her back . The shaman felt a thick carpet of grass under her bare legs . She pushed herself up on elbows , inspected the backs of her hands . As she had expected , there were no wrinkles in the skin . No pain in her joints . The elder was young . Her eyes searched for the sun but could not find that bright orb . The sky was thick with gauzy clouds , the air moist and heavy with the perfume of wild roses . She was in the center of a great meadow , dotted here and there by an isolated oak , maple , or elm . But mostly there was thick grass and fragrant wildflowers . Daisy got to her feet , brushed off her nightgown . The great field was bordered on one side by low , wooded hills , on another by a wide river . This place was not real like Middle World , where her aged body slept . It was real in a completely different way . And it was very still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hound on a scent , she sniffed . The atmosphere fairly crackled with the expectation of some awful calamity . Having had a thousand visions , Daisy Perika was not unduly alarmed . Morning would find her safely back in her bed near the mouth of Caon del Espiritu . Knowing that these visions always had a purpose and that something would certainly happen , she waited . It was not necessary to wait long . Daisy felt a slight tug at her skirt . She looked down at the elfin creature whose head barely reached above her knee . It was the Little Man . The pitukupf was dressed in a green cotton shirt , buckskin breeches , beaded moccasins . He also wore a floppy black hat and a dark expression . The shaman stared at her power spirit , waiting for him to speak . He uttered not a word . But the dwarf did raise his arm . Point . Daisy looked up , saw something approaching through the mists . The intense silence was penetrated by the rhythmic beating of hooves on turf . Appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . Upon the great beast , a rider . She felt a surge of joy to behold this marvelous sight . To own such a fine mount , this one must surely be an important chief . But as horse and rider came near , she realized that this was not a man of the People . This was a white-a matukach . More from prudence than alarm , the Ute woman took a step backward . She watched him rein in the horse , dismount . The tall man wore tightly fitted white breeches , a pale yellow silk shirt with lace at the collar , a long blue cloak . His knee-high black boots glistened like polished midnight . She stared . Should I know this man ? The stranger took note of the Ute woman and the dwarf ; a wry half-smile passed across his face . He made a slight , formal bow to the visitors from the West . The shaman returned the bow , smiled . This was a good-looking fellow . And quite the gentleman . Daisy brushed a wisp of hair from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the patched nightgown . The muscular horse snorted , stamped a hoof against the earth . Three times . The tall man comforted the animal with words that Daisy could not hear . The shaman looked down to consult with her power spirit . The dwarf had vanished . This was , as visions went , a rather pleasant one . She waited for the white man to speak to her , but the handsome stranger remained silent . Indeed , he now took no notice of the Indian woman 's presence . He gazed off into the distance , toward the great river . His eyes turned glassy . He was as one whose vision penetrates things present-to see another , more distant world . There was a slight puff of wind that dried her eyes . Daisy blinked . The white man was standing by a tripod-mounted surveyor 's transit . He waited until the suspended plumb bob had damped its pendulumous motions , then checked the compass and the leveling bubble . Apparently satisfied with the instrument , he squinted through the eye-piece . Marveled at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vertical and horizontal verniers were consulted , angles and bearings duly noted . He consulted a map , inked numbers and symbols onto the lined pages of a small ledger . Again , the shaman blinked . The man was on his knees with a triangular trowel . He had already laid a sure foundation that rested on bedrock . Now he was setting the massive cornerstone . Daisy blinked a third time . Now the man was old and frail , his thinning hair white like lambs ' wool . He rested in a rocking chair , under the pleasant shade of a hawthorn tree . The matukach elder watched a great number of workers-far more than the Ute woman could count . Continues ...
