<p> For Jeffrey J. Steiner , chairman and chief executive of Fairchild Corp. , nearly $2.5 million in salary last year was just the beginning . <p> The company 's notice for its annual meeting lists various dealings between Fairchild and Steiner family interests . There were payments by Fairchild for a chartered helicopter and a chartered aircraft and an apartment in Paris . There were family members on the payroll , interest-free loans outstanding to family members , and $258,000 for Steiner 's personal expenses , later reimbursed . There were $1.7 million in advances on his retirement pay , according to the proxy statement , on top of almost $3 million the year before , though Steiner did not retire . <p> And there was a triple dip of sorts related to the sale of a subsidiary to Alcoa Corp . at the end of 2002 . Steiner received $3.1 million , part of a golden parachute from Fairchild , without bailing out . He also received a $5.2 million bonus from Fairchild for his work on the deal . And he and his son Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consulting contract with Alcoa worth $5 million over four years . <p> In addition , the company reported that it had spent $5 million on Steiner 's legal expenses as of October and had posted a bond of more than $1.5 million with a French court before Steiner was convicted of a criminal offense last year in France . Fairchild reported that he was given a suspended sentence of one year and was ordered to pay a fine of about $597,000 . The judgment related to " unjustified use " of a French oil company 's funds in 1990 , Fairchild reported . <p> Meanwhile , Fairchild , once the maker of the tank-killing A-10 jet , reported a loss of $53.2 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30 , 2003 , and had lost money in three of the four previous years . <p> James D. Cox , a professor of corporate law at Duke University , said Steiner 's arrangements look like " shameless overreaching " and " a raid on the Fairchild treasury . " <p> " Where was the board and what were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal 2003 either declined to comment , did not return calls , referred calls to the firm or could not be found . <p> In a statement to The Washington Post , Fairchild said it " has complied , and continues to comply fully with all laws and regulations applicable to its business . " <p> " Consistent with accepted practices of corporate governance , a majority of Fairchild 's directors are independent of management , " the company said . " Many of the issues raised by he Washington Post are dealt with by independent directors who are elected in the customary manner by Fairchild 's shareholders . " <p> The company added that " bonus targets for senior management have been approved by a strong majority of outside shareholders for each of the last three years . " <p> And Fairchild 's independent directors are reviewing " issues arising from " the court proceedings in France , including expenses the company paid on Steiner 's behalf , Fairchild recently reported . <p> The French court has ordered that part of Steiner 's fine be withdrawn from the bond Fairchild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing . <p> Steiner , 67 , who has headed Fairchild since 1985 , and other executives declined to be interviewed , spokesman Howard Paster said . Through Paster , the firm invited The Post to submit written questions and then declined to answer most of them . <p> Steiner was among the dealmakers funded by Drexel Burnham Lambert during the 1980s reign of " junk bond " king Michael Milken . He is less vulnerable to shareholder pressure than most executives because , through stock ownership and majority voting power , his family controls Fairchild . <p> Steiner , a native of Austria , grew up in Turkey and headed subsidiaries of Texas Instruments in Latin America and Europe before embarking on a career buying and selling corporations . <p> Fairchild , once known for making airplanes , had left that business by the time Steiner gained control in 1989 . Before the sale of the Fairchild Fasteners subsidiary in 2002 , the company 's main business was making nuts , bolts , screws , and rivets used in airplanes . Since then , Steiner has largely reinvented the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other accessories for motorcyclists . Among other businesses , the firm owns a shopping center in New York . <p> Under Steiner , Fairchild has employed three of his children in recent years . <p> Fairchild 's board has seven members besides Steiner and his son Eric . Long-serving directors include former internal revenue commissioner Mortimer M. Caplin , 88 , who is a senior member of the Caplin &; Drysdale law firm , and Herbert S. Richey , 82 , president of Richey Coal Co. and chairman of Fairchild 's audit committee . <p> Caplin referred questions to the company 's general counsel , who did not return calls . Richey declined to comment . <p> The directors are " in an odd position , " said Brian Foley , a compensation consultant at Brian Foley &; Co . . " They in effect serve at the pleasure of the controlling shareholder . " <p> Caplin and Richey , among other directors , had outstanding loans from the company as of June 30 , 2003 , according to the company 's October 2003 proxy report , an annual filing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice , were for the purchase of Fairchild stock . The loans could be called in when the directors leave the board , the company has reported . <p> Over the years , Steiner 's pay at Fairchild has inspired protests by shareholders , including a lawsuit more than a decade ago that prompted him to make some concessions . Compensation analyst Graef S. Crystal devoted a chapter to Steiner in his 1991 book , " In Search of Excess : The Overcompensation of American Executives . " <p> In a 1998 Washington Post story , Steiner said he was " very aware " of criticism leveled against his compensation . " But when I compare my own income with some of the advisers at investment banks who are far more junior and far less knowledgeable about finance than me , I do n't feel so bad , " he said . <p> In 2001 , Steiner compromised further after Mario Gabelli , head of an investment firm with a big stake in the company , filed a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission calling Fairchild 's compensation structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Fairchild board . Gabelli complained at the time that " Jeff has got to wake up . " <p> For four of the past five years , Steiner has had the highest salary in a Washington Post survey of executive compensation at the area 's publicly traded companies . <p> Over five years , Fairchild 's stock severely underperformed an index of its peers in the aerospace and defense industries . While $100 invested in the peer group in mid-1998 would have been worth $129.76 in mid-2003 , assuming dividends were reinvested , $100 invested in Fairchild would have declined to $19.96 , Fairchild said in its most recent proxy report to the Securities and Exchange Commission , filed in October 2003 . <p> However , during the fiscal year that ended June 30 , 2003 , Fairchild 's stock climbed from $3.40 to $4.03 a share . It closed last week at $4 , and the company turned a profit of $7.1 million during the quarter that ended June 30 , 2004 . <p> The limited disclosures in Fairchild 's SEC filings , sometimes phrased in legalistic language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the company declined to provide further details . <p> Fairchild paid $66,000 during fiscal 2003 for the upkeep of a Paris apartment owned by a Steiner family company , Fairchild reported . The apartment was used " from time to time " by Eric Steiner when he was traveling on business , the company reported . " Overall , we believe our cost for such apartment is less than the cost of similar accommodations for our business related travel . " <p> Before loans to officers and directors were banned in 2002 by the post-Enron corporate governance reforms , Fairchild extended no-interest loans totaling more than $500,000 to Steiner and two of his children , who worked at Fairchild , according to company filings . The loans were meant to encourage ownership of Fairchild 's stock and " provide additional incentive to promote our success , " the company reported . <p> In recent years , Steiner has gotten approval to receive $4.6 million from executive retirement plans without having to retire . Foley , the executive compensation consultant , said it was unusual for a chief executive to tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem justified that the company should start paying out until they 've finished paying salary and benefits of the executive , " said Paul Hodgson , a compensation analyst at the Corporate Library , which provides information for institutional shareholders . <p> All of Steiner 's retirement advances disclosed in its last annual proxy report , almost $1.7 million , came from an unfunded plan for Fairchild executives , according to the filing . <p> Fairchild reported that it paid $568,000 in fiscal 2003 to charter an aircraft owned by " an affiliate of Mr. Jeffrey Steiner . " The company did n't identify the affiliate or explain the nature of the affiliation , but it said in another SEC filing that all of that money was a " prepayment . . . for the future use of the aircraft . " Fairchild said it paid $308,000 for use of a helicopter owned by a Steiner company . <p> Fairchild reported that it paid 5 percent less than the going rate for the helicopter and market rates for the other aircraft . <p> As a general matter , owning an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting Jan. 1 , 2003 , Steiner deferred 20 percent of his base salary , the firm 's proxy report said without explanation . Yet by June 30 of last year , Fairchild had paid $258,000 for " personal expenses " of Steiner , the company reported . Steiner reimbursed the company in August 2003 , the company reported . <p> Fairchild did not explain the specific nature of the expenses , over what period they were incurred , why the company paid or whether Steiner paid the company interest on the money . <p> If somebody determined after the fact that the company had paid expenses that were personal rather than business , " it could be that it was in effect an unauthorized loan , " said Lyman Johnson , a professor of corporate law at Washington and Lee University . But Johnson added that " if it 's an innocent mistake , then I do n't think that any sanction should follow . " <p> Fairchild reported that the amount Steiner owed the company in 2003 never exceeded the amount that the company owed him as deferred salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment expenses " which benefit the company , " Fairchild reported . That covered just " a portion " of Steiner 's entertainment expenses , the company reported . <p> Steiner could have taken home more money if the board had not stepped in , company filings show . Under an unusual incentive plan , Steiner was entitled to up to 2.5 percent of the money Fairchild received from selling pieces of itself . For the $657.1 million sale of the fastener subsidiary to Alcoa , that would have amounted to $16.4 million , the company reported . Instead , the board 's compensation committee decided that he should get a $5.2 million bonus related to the sale . <p> The Steiners also negotiated a $5 million side deal with Alcoa in which they personally agreed not to compete with the business Fairchild sold Alcoa and to be available as consultants to Alcoa . <p> Noncompete payments are commonly made to employees with critical knowledge of a subsidiary 's operations or customers , said John F. Olson , a corporate lawyer at the firm Gibson , Dunn &; Crutcher LLP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chief executives who are primarily investors , financiers or turnaround specialists . He added that they can be used as inducements to get executives or major shareholders to go along with a deal . <p> " The burden of proof is really on the board to explain why that money belongs to the executives and not to Fairchild 's shareholders , " said Nell Minow of the Corporate Library . <p> John C. Coffee , a professor at Columbia Law School specializing in corporate law , said that , as a general matter , non-compete payments to chief executives or controlling shareholders when a subsidiary is sold can be a means of diverting to those individuals money that should go to all the shareholders as part of the sale price . <p> Asked whether Alcoa or the Steiners sought the noncompete contract , Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery said by e-mail , " No one can recall who first came up with the idea , but it 's fair to say that at the end of the day it was a mutual agreement . " <p> Lowery would not say how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On top of the other payments , Steiner received what is known in the parlance of the boardroom as a " change of control payment . " Those are often triggered when an executive loses his job in a takeover . Also known as golden parachutes , they are commonly written into executives ' employment contracts to compensate them for loss of their job or demotion if their company is taken over by another . They were invented to neutralize an executive 's incentive to resist deals that might benefit shareholders but leave the executive unemployed , said Randall S , Thomas , a professor of law and business at Vanderbilt University Law School . <p> Fairchild reported that contracts of its executives entitled them to change of control payments if the company sold " substantially all of our assets , " and Fairchild said the fastener business represented about 68 percent of its assets . <p> Steiner 's employment contract also linked any change of control payment to the termination of his employment , according to documents filed with the SEC . <p> However , Steiner received a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After selling the fastener business to Alcoa , the company struck a new deal with its chief executive , allowing him to receive half of his $6.3 million change of control payment in 2003 and the rest when his employment ends . In return , Steiner agreed to stay on the job . <p> Staff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report .
