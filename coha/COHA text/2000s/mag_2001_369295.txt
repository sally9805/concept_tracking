The best animated satires  --  The Simpsons , South Park  --  are paeans to the power of stupidity . Gary and Mike are no Homer and Bart , but this Claymation-com is at least better than its premise . ( Dweeb and slacker go on road trip ; hilarity , rabbit squashing ensue . ) The gross-out humor misses more than it hits , but the show can surprise you , as when the dim duo visit Washington and ruins the life-work of an earnest Senator , turning a pat setup on its head : the pol is betrayed by the people . It 's worth seeing where this ride goes . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
