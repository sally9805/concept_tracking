A Franklin tree is tucked in behind the stove . // When Hurricane Fran rolled through Raleigh several years ago , she left a wide swath of turmoil , including thousands of downed trees and damaged homes . While Rob Gardner 's house was spared , his meticulously tended woodland garden lay buried underneath piles offallen pines . " At first , " says Rob , " I thought it was ruined . I mean , layers of trees covered everything . But some friends and I just started carving away , and we eventually found the soil again . " With a lifetime supply of free bark mulch , Rob turned this disaster into a perfect opportunity to reinvent his garden as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hurricane was the best thing that ever happened to my garden , " he says . Gardening by Subtraction Once the pine trees were out of the way , Rob put the bones back into his garden by creating a series of outdoor rooms , each with a unique combination of plants and art donated by friends . he anchored the rooms with an antique wood-burning stove and shorter ornamental trees , such as a flowering apricot ( Prunus mume ) and a weeping Kousa dogwood ( Cornus kousa ) . The trees give a special feel to each room and create a long show of seasonal color . With the dramatic increase of sunlight in the garden , Rob went on to add daylilies , coneflowers , and other full-sun perennials to his once impressive collection of woodland plants . " A lot of opportunities opened up in the garden after the hurricane . So it 's been really fun to come home every day with new ideas and new ways to experiment with the plant arrangements , " he says . All Plants Are Equal Rob selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his zone . " I spend most of my time as a curator at the North Carolina Botanical Garden working exclusively with natives , " he says . " But when I get home , it 's fun to have a broader palette to draw from . I guess I 'm just interested in all plants . " Photograph An artist named Simple cut these garden egrets out of metal and gave them to Rob . Coleus forms the mass of color in theregrets ' bed .

So I do n't hesitate to yank out stuff if it 's not performing or does n't look right , " he says . " How else can you discover what 's perfect ? " Hurricane-Proof Gardening Rob explains how he got his start mixing and matching art and plants . " Before Hurricane Fran hit , I remembered to bring in the lawn furniture but forgot about the gazing balls . Needless to say , when we hauled off the last tree from the backyard , the globes were broken . That 's when my friend Jim Massey gave me my first piece of hurricane-proof garden art . " The decorated bowling ball fascinated and inspired Rob . he found that creating garden art was a great winter project and was easily justified . " If you put a plain bowling ball in your backyard , people will wonder why you have it there , " he says . " But if you decorate the ball , suddenly it becomes an intriguing focal point-and a subject of discussion . Now I can put almost anything in my garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Photograph A bottle tree is an essential component to any good Southern folk art garden . When sunlight passes through the glass , sparkling rays illuminate the yard . Sidebar MATCHING PLANTS AND ART * Limit the number of colors to create a more subtle effect . For instance , use only gold and yellow or burgundy and silver . * Knit the garden together in a single composition by repeating plant colors in the artwork , such as using a yellow gazing globe to match the variegation in leaves . * Draw visitors into an area of the garden with bright annuals , such as impatiens or coleus . Then let them discover the more subtle details of a perennial 's foliage or an intricate piece of artwork . * Repeat the same textures in plants and art to promote a unified appearance . For example , smooth , slick hosta leaves will shine next to a silver trophy . // <p>
