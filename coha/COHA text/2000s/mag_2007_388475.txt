Readers of our cover story on Rudy Giuliani , front runner for the GOP presidential nomination , had trenchant views on the man known as the hero of 9/11 . One said , " Strength , skill , stubbornness , abrasiveness . Do we need these characteristics in a leader ? You bet we do . Rudy is the right man for the right time . " Added a lifelong New Yorker , " Giuliani should be elected so he can do for the country what he did for the city . " But his critics also had plenty to say . Commenting on all the adulation , one wrote , " Rudy did what every competent mayor would do in time of crisis . Save the " hero " title for the actual rescue workers . " Another noted , " Aside from our president , Giuliani is the one politician who 's taken personal political advantage from the tragedy that claimed the lives of real heroes . " After weighing the pros and cons , one reader said , " I could n't care less about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good leader . " Getting to Know Giuliani I am extremely hard pressed to understand why NEWSWEEK , along with most of the media , insist on worshiping at the altar of Rudy Giuliani , the hero ( " Master of Disaster , " March 12 ) . What did he do during the crisis of 9/11 that any other civic leader would not have done ? Did he go into the crumbled buildings to rescue his " fellow Americans " like the truly heroic firefighters and police officers that day ? Did he don a flak jacket and helmet and head to Afghanistan or Iraq ? What exactly has Giuliani done to inspire such adulation ? From what I 've seen , he 's simply managed to capitalize on having been in the right place at the wrong time . Cathy Brennan Pittsburgh , Pa . Rudy Giuliani 's performance was amazing during and after the horrors of 9/11 , which devastated not only New York City , but also the nation and the world . But his serially cavalier personal life demonstrates a weakness of moral and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican  --  a comfort level that would allow me to vote for him as president . Mary D. Dunn Chelmsford , Mass . I am a conservative but feel many conservatives have lost their bearings . What ever happened to keeping government out of the bedroom and out of the womb ? I am not pro-abortion , but I get very annoyed when conservatives want government to meddle in individuals ' lives . I think many conservatives have forgotten about the separation of church and state . Therefore , Rudy Giuliani is my man . Steve Savage Marietta , Ga . I suspect the farther from New York , the more heroic Rudy Giuliani looks . I 've lived in New York for more than 40 years and have worked in government and as president of the New York Urban League . I can say unequivocally that Giuliani was the most divisive , racist , mean-spirited , inflexible mayor in the past 50 years . He was isolated by choice with a small group of longtime advisers who serve him to this day . His public disdain for the black community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was emblematic of that period . Several unjustified shootings by the cops and constant harassment of young black men is a bitter memory . The notion that Giuliani could be president is offensive , and many of us wonder why this aspect of his history is so conveniently forgotten . Harriet R. Michel New York , N.Y . Jonathan Alter insists on making " cowboy " into a derogatory word ( " Wrong Time for an Urban Cowboy ? " ) . What do you all think a cowboy is ? Spend a week being a cowboy and see if you still feel like using the word disrespectfully . Patricia Laudon Casper , WYO . Jihadists are not going away if and when we pull out of Iraq ; they are definitely waiting to strike again . Rudy Giuliani is wise to acknowledge this and I give him credit for wanting the job of president . NEWSWEEK is right about reviving America 's prestige , but it has to be done without giving an inch to the enemy . As for his urban-cowboy style  --  it 's exactly what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane tickets and wants Americans dead . Giuliani 's got my vote ! Bob Sidoti Pompton Lakes , N.J. A Poet of Public Importance I want to thank George Will for his wonderful essay about Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ( " Longfellow : A Founder , " last word , March 12 ) . In this age of sound bites and speeches tested in focus groups , it felt good to be reminded what real wisdom sounds like . I was inspired to pick up a book of Longfellow 's works and read it aloud to myself . Rereading " Paul Revere 's Ride " I felt so grateful for Longfellow 's ability to put our nation 's mythology into words so I could feel those old stories again as if they were fresh , and , for a moment , get lost in the sense that I knew what it was like to be there on that day and make that ride . Erica Steinweg University Heights , Ohio America has n't been quite as forgetful about Longfellow 's 200th birthday as George Will suggests . In addition to celebrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth , Portland , Maine , the blogosphere was filled with commentary and poems were read on NPR . The academic tide is turning with Longfellow 's getting serious attention in several recent scholarly books . Finally , trying to enlist Longfellow as a soldier in the ( now very tired ) culture war against modernism does him a real disservice . In many ways Longfellow was a typical , mid-19th-century New England liberal , but with a soft ideological touch . His real virtues were a capacious mind , great cultural sympathies , a feeling imagination and a superb ear . His sense of being an American  --  and there was no one whose Revolutionary pedigree was finer  --  never conflicted with his sense of being a citizen of the world . Richard D'Abate Executive Director , Maine Historical Society Portland , Maine GM Takes On Toyota It was refreshing to see your comparison of Toyota and General Motors ( " Comin " Through ! " March 12 ) . Most surprising was to see an article that refuted the unabashedly free-trade views that are so often featured . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but neglected to point out that if it were n't for voluntary export restraints , it would never have begun manufacturing vehicles in the United States . Evidently , " protectionist " policies like VERs do help provide American jobs . Darin Gilley Pacific , Mo . I chuckled to myself when I read that General Motors is trying to launch an electric-powered vehicle . I found this particularly infuriating after having watched the documentary " Who Killed the Electric Car ? " GM disregarded consumers who were leasing the EV1 prototype ( which was already well developed ) , and ended up reclaiming and destroying every test vehicle people were already driving . And we wonder why GM is in such a financial crisis ? I certainly do understand the difficulties it is in right now , but this total disregard of consumers led me to one conclusion : I will never buy a GM vehicle . Alex K. Manda Amherst , Mass . A major reason Toyota can make cars for less than it costs General Motors is the Japanese government 's policy of maintaining an artificially weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car a $4,000 windfall cost advantage over a car built in America by a U.S. automaker . For higher-end Japanese imported SUVs  --  like the Toyota Highlander  --  and for almost the entire imported Lexus line , that yen subsidy can run up to $12,000 per car . GM , Ford and DaimlerChrysler have proved they can compete profitably and successfully in markets on every continent . However , Toyota and other Japanese automakers are not competing fairly because their government effectively subsidizes its auto industry through the artificially weak yen . Such a policy continues to cost American jobs and hurts the U.S. economy . Stephen Collins President , Automotive Trade Policy Council Washington , D.C. A Fierce Sex-Change Debate I was discouraged by the article about Largo , Fla. , City Manager Steven Stanton , whose needs and perceived rights apparently were more important than those of his 13-year-old son ( " A Case of Gender Blues , " March 12 ) . How sad that Stanton could not postpone his needs until his son is older and more emotion-ally equipped to handle such news . It continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be only on the perceived narcissistic urges of the parent instead of the actual needs of the true victims of adult selfishness  --  their children . Keith J. Van Leuven Parrish , Fla . For commissioner Mary Gray Black to say that Steven Stanton lacks integrity , trust , respect and confidence is like the pot calling the kettle black . He demonstrates exactly these traits in being honest with himself , his family and community . As more is learned about how hormones affect the brain of the developing fetus , this kind of hate and bigotry is unacceptable . Why do these people think they get a say in someone else 's life , anyway ? Robyn Niblock Hollywood , Fla . Americans Ignorant of Religion As an avowed atheist and believer in separation of church and state , I wholeheartedly support Prof. Steve Prothero 's suggestion of teaching religion in public schools as a means to better understand and effectively engage with the rest of the world ( " The Gospel of Prothero , " March 12 ) . Unfortunately , he undermines his argument when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . No religion should trump another . Lump all religions in one course , with all receiving equal billing and no proselytizing , and I 'd be happy to sign on . Jeff Gusman Santa Rosa , Calif . I would argue , conversely , that it is critically important to have a spiritual sense of God and ethical standards , rather than be well versed in the underpinnings of all religious doctrines in the world . Too many Americans feel they know everything they need to about Jesus and the Bible . Too many profess to be devout Christians , observe their Sunday obligations and claim to be saved , but seem to have a tremendous blind spot to the actual teachings of Jesus . These same Christians are quick to judge ( first ones to cast a stone ) , and then wonder why Americans are so reviled in other parts of the world . I wish people would study what Jesus actually taught , rather than go through the motions of their religious doctrine . If they tried to practice what Jesus preached , they might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Tom Caffery Orlando , Fla . If Americans are ignorant of the facts behind religion , a goodly share of the blame belongs to mainstream churches and their ministers . Despite the fact that Americans are attaining higher levels of education , churches remain places to believe , not places to think . Ministers rarely challenge congregants to ask questions , do research , think deeply or explore other faiths with anything like an open mind . Rigorous thought is suspect . Intellectuals , especially intellectual women , are not particularly welcome . In my experience , ministers just want congregations to believe , obey and donate  --  generously . Dorothy LaBounty St. Louis , Mo . Should Art Stay or Should It Go ? I recently spent an afternoon gazing at the Elgin Marbles at the British Museum , and as a first-generation Greek-American , I could n't help but feel a certain ambivalence regarding the rightful ownership of these magnificent antiquities ( " Whose Art Is It ? " March 12 ) . On the one hand , had foreign governments not gone and preserved these relics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , I felt that these marbles belong in Athens , where I was one of many visitors to the Acropolis who signed a government petition to have them returned . Perhaps leading museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum will be at the forefront of establishing policy that will resolve this very complex issue .
