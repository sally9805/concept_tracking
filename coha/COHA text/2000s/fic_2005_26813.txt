System of the World , The Volume Three of The Baroque Cycle Book 6 Solomon 's Gold Dartmoor 15 january 1714 In life there is nothing more foolish than inventing .  --  James Watt " Men half your age and double your weight have been slain on these wastes by Extremity of Cold , " said the Earl of Lostwithiel , Lord Warden of the Stannaries , and Rider of the Forest and Chase of Dartmoor , to one of his two fellow-travelers . The wind had paused , as though Boreas had exhausted his lungs and was drawing in a new breath of air from somewhere above Iceland . So the young Earl was able to say this in matter-of-fact tones . " Mr. Newcomen and I are very glad of your company , but  --  " The wind struck them all deaf , as though the three men were candle-flames to be blown out . They staggered , planted their downwind feet against the black , stony ground , and leaned into it . Lostwithiel shouted : " We 'll not think you discourteous if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black carriage stopped along the track a short distance away , rocking on its French suspension . It had been artfully made to appear lighter than it was , and looked as if the only thing preventing it from tumbling end-over-end across the moor was the motley team of draught-horses harnessed to it , shaggy manes standing out horizontally in the gale . " I am astonished that you should call this an extremity of cold , " answered the old man . " In Boston , as you know , this would pass without remark . I am garbed for Boston . " He was shrouded in a rustic leather cape , which he parted in the front to reveal a lining pieced together from the pelts of many raccoons . " After that passage through the intestinal windings of the Gorge of Lyd , we are all in want of fresh air  --  especially , if I read the signs rightly , Mr. Newcomen . " That was all the leave Thomas Newcomen wanted . His face , which was as pale as the moon , bobbed once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever come to a formal bow . Having thus taken his leave , he turned his broad back upon them and trudged quickly downwind . Soon he became hard to distinguish from the numerous upright boulders  --  which might be read as a comment on his physique , or on the gloominess of the day , or on the badness of Daniel 's eyesight . " The Druids loved to set great stones on end , " commented the Earl . " For what purpose , I can not imagine . " " You have answered the question by asking it . " " I beg your pardon ? " " Dwelling as they did in this God-forsaken place , they did it so that men would come upon these standing stones two thousand years after they were dead , and know they had been here . The Duke of Marlborough , throwing up that famous Pile of Blenheim Palace , is no different . " The Earl of Lostwithiel felt it wise to let this pass without comment . He turned and kicked a path through some stiff withered grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daniel understood it as one corner of a ruined building . The ground yielded under their feet . It was spread thin over a shambles of tumbledown rafters and disintegrating peat-turves . Anyway the angle gave them shelter from the wind . " Speaking now in my capacity as Lord Warden of the Stannaries , I welcome you to Dartmoor , Daniel Waterhouse , on behalf of the Lord of the Manor . " Daniel sighed . " If I 'd been in London the last twenty years , keeping up with my Heraldic Arcana , and going to tea with the Bluemantle Pursuivant , I would know who the hell that was . But as matters stand  --  " " Dartmoor was created part of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1338 , and as such became part of the possessions of the Prince of Wales  --  a title created by King Edward I in  --  " " So in a roundabout way , you are welcoming me on behalf of the Prince of Wales , " Daniel said abruptly , in a bid to yank the Earl back before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the Princess . Who , if the Hanovers come , shall be  --  " " Princess Caroline of Ansbach . Yes . Her name keeps coming up . Did she send you to track me down in the streets of Plymouth ? " The Earl looked a little wounded . " I am the son of your old friend . I encountered you by luck . My surprise was genuine . The welcome given you by my wife and children was unaffected . If you doubt it , come to our house next Christmas . " " Then why do you go out of your way to bring up the Princess ? " " Only because I wish to be plain-spoken . Where you are going next it is all intrigue . There is a sickness of the mind that comes over those who bide too long in London , which causes otherwise rational men to put forced and absurd meanings on events that are accidental . " " I have observed that sickness in full flower , " Daniel allowed , thinking of one man in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months from now , when you become aware of all this , ' Aha , the Earl of Lostwithiel was nothing more than a cat 's paw for Caroline  --  who knows what other lies he may have told me ! ' " " Very well . For you to disclose it now exhibits wisdom beyond your years . " " Some would call it timidity originating in the disasters that befell my father , and his father . " " I do not take that view of it , " Daniel said curtly . He was startled by bulk and motion to one side , and feared it was a standing-stone toppled by the wind ; but it was only Thomas Newcomen , looking a good deal pinker . " God willing , that carriage-ride is the closest I shall ever come to a sea-voyage ! " he declared . " May the Lord so bless you , " Daniel returned . " In the storms of the month past , we were pitched and tossed about so much that all hands were too sick to eat for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to praying that we would .
