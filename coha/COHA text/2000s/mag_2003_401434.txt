Anderson 's restaurant in Panama City Beach . // I have vacationed here as a child , as a teenager , as a newlywed , and as a father . My wife and I plan to vacation here when we become empty nesters . That 's not uncommon for those who call this 95-mile stretch of Florida 's Panhandle , simply , The Beach . The lure of the place , once experienced , tugs for a lifetime . From Destin east to Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Posh resorts vie with tiny bungalows . Bustling cities glitter in stark contrast with quaint fishing villages . Fabulous or rustic , tacky or elegant , vibrant or laid-back , the area has something for everyone . The common thread that runs through it all remains the emerald green waters and finest powder-white sand in the world . Lodging-Family Fun on the Emerald Coast To newcomers , the discovery is Destin-the sleepy fishing **31;536;TOOLONG . Many families or couples spend an entire week here and never have to get into a car . Condos are the lodging of choice . Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort is the area 's largest resort complex and features fine hotel rooms , condominiums , four great golf courses , upscale shopping , and a variety of eateries . Seaside , the Panhandle 's first planned community , sets a look and style that still gives Scenic Highway 30A , the 19-mile loop off of U.S. 98 , a fantasy feel . Next door to Seaside sits the WaterColor Inn and Resort , a swank new spot that opened last year . Nearby you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lodging in the Seaside area costs anywhere from $100 up to any price you want to pay . Panama City Beach is a family beach , a teenage hangout , and a splash of old Florida all rolled into one . Classic family-owned motels have dotted this stretch of sand for decades , though remodeled chain hotels , high-rise condominiums , and private rental homes are common today . Marriott 's Bay Point Resort Village , which is on St. Andrews Bay , sports fine golfing and big-league resort accommodations . But beware : Traffic on Front Beach Road is a tangle on summer nights . While the coastal towns of Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe are different , they feel the same . They echo the unspoiled scenes from the postcard days of travel . It 's not an area that time forgot , just one devoid of today 's crowds . Your best lodging bets here are beach cottages , bed-and-breakfasts , familyrun motels , and beach campgrounds and cabins at St. Joseph Peninsula State Park . ( RV campgrounds are in the area too . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities ' Web sites ( see box on page 20 ) . Dining-Beach Burgers to Prime Seafood The Emerald Coast is blessed with an array of dining choices that fit any budget and taste . Panama City Beach boasts two of the classic old-style Florida restaurants ( huge dining rooms and big crowds ) . Both have good food . Capt . Anderson 's ( a perennial Southern Living Readers ' Choice Awards winner ) overlooks the fishing fleet on the sunset side of St. Andrews Bay . Angelo 's Steak Pit ( my favorite big steak house in Florida ) , located on Front Beach Road , has a landmark larger than life : A steer named Big Gus proudly stands out front . Everything here is cooked over an open fire . Any steak is great , but the hamburger steak , which tastes more like a T-bone , is my usual choice , and it 's also the cheapest menu item . Port St. Joe and Mexico Beach are dotted with mom-and-pop restaurants , but two that stand out are the Dockside Cafe ( Cajun shrimp steamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Port St. Joe and Half Shells ( noted for their tasty steamed shrimp as well ) in Mexico Beach . The most exciting dining area in this part of Florida has to be along 30A , which harbors about any type of food you might desire . For fried and fresh , head to Nick 's on the Beach ( their cocktail sauce is a favorite of mine ) . Nearby sits the restaurant that started it all in this area-Criolla 's , preferred by our Executive Editor of Foods , Susan Dosier . Owned by Johnny Earles , Criolla 's captures the sunny flavors and ingredients of the Caribbean , yet their dishes are served with a Louisiana accent . Cafe Thirty-A in Seagrove Beach , Bud &; Alley 's Restaurant in Seaside , and Fish Out of Water at the WaterColor Inn and Resort all have good food and great settings . Like Criolla 's , though , they 're some of the area 's priciest options . Photograph clockwise from top , left : Enjoy afternoon tea at Miss Lucille 's Gossip Parlor . Dockside Cafe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite of one of our Executive Editors . Capt . Anderson 's seafood market fascinates both kids and adults . The Red Bar is a local landmark known for its food and entertainment . // The Red Bar in Grayton Beach is known for its scallops at night and great fish sandwiches during the day . Cafe Sublime in Gulf Place serves excellent Tuscan-roasted snapper . And if you tire of Florida fare , saunter over to Trattoria Borago for upscale Italian . My friends George and Kaye Adams , knowledgeable food folks who have a condo in the area , swear by the tomato  --  basil soup here . We also like one small restaurant with two names , Summer Kitchen Cafe ( by day ) and Blue By Night Bistro ( for dinner ) at Rosemary Beach . They create good salads and rollups for lunch , while the evening menu dishes out excellent fresh fish and steak . Less than a mile from Rosemary Beach is Inlet Beach . It is at the end of 30A , back on U.S. 98 . Here you 'll find The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I zoomed by 20 times before giving it a shot ) , but they offer fantastic food with an elegant touch . Two other eateries around the Phillips Inlet Bridge with simple , inexpensive , and tasty food are Spicy Noodle ( pasta and pizza ) and Jolly Roger Grill ( seafood and gumbo ) . Dining in Destin can be as hit-andmiss as at any other beach destination . One spot not to skip is the great breakfast place and bakery , The Donut Hole . There are two locations-one in Santa Rosa Beach and one in downtown Destin . Be sure to try the crabmeat Benedict . A new area in Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort called The Village of Baytowne Wharf is full of restaurants ( get a pass at the resort gate on the bay side , and ask for directions ) . If you try only one eatery here , make sure it 's the Acme Oyster House , which serves up delicious grilled oysters and huge po'boys with sweet potato fries . Shopping-Everything Under The Sun From antiques to outlets to just good junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy . Palace and Alvin 's Island rank as the Panhandle 's souvenir shop kings , but there are numerous others , too , especially on the strip in Panama City Beach . Antiques shops and art galleries ( some fine and others not so fine ) tend to cluster at either end of 30A . Maybe the area 's biggest draw is the Silver Sands Factory Stores , where the art of outlet shopping can be explored to the fullest with more than 100 retailers . ( See box on page 18 for my 10 favorite local shops . ) Things To Do-Just for Fun Anywhere on the Emerald Coast you 'll find beautiful beaches that make for perfect lounging and relaxing . But if you want something more active , you 've got plenty of options . The area 's two big water parks , Shipwreck Island in Panama City Beach and Big Kahuna 's in Destin , are warm-weather , family-based attractions that offer all  --  day passes for fun away from the surf . ( Note : These parks do n't open on a regular basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding all along the coast . In fact , it 's a hard choice between the harbor in Destin and the marinas on St. Andrews Bay in Panama City Beach . Port St. Joe Marina not only features fishing charters , but it is also a good resource for area dive charters , snorkel outings , and ecotourism trips . Port St. Joe offers horseback riding along the surf as well . Finally , nearly every major beach has opportunities to ride the waves in a catamaran or shoot across the ocean on a personal watercraft . ( Visit www. beachesofsouthwalton.com to scout out more area activities . ) Photograph Whether you 're looking for a comfortable outfit to wear to the beach , a cute souvenir , or fun home furnishings and accessories , the row of individual stores at the Shops of Grayton in Grayton Beach has plenty of everything . // Fun is relative for those who want to enjoy a glass of wine at sunset on water 's edge . This is a place where , on a clear day , sunsets rival the ones you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of trails along the open road of 30A and plenty of shops that rent wheels . The big-time teenage/adult party spot is Panama City Beach with its Miracle Strip amusement park and other family-style entertainment , such as miniature golf , miniature race cars , and skee ball . Destin offers more of the same . Believe it or not , on 30A you can even visit a gossip parlor named Miss Lucille 's for lots of talk with coffee , desserts , and libations . Florida 's Emerald Coast has been a special place for my family for generations past , and , I hope , for generations to come . It may only be a 95-mile stretch , but the opportunities for fun are limitless .
