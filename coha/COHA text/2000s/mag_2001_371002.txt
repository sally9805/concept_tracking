Los Angeles lawyer Marc Hankin watched as his father 's Alzheimer 's gradually robbed him of his ability to function and imposed devastating financial strains on his family . So Hankin , now 51 , vowed that he would be ready in case he ever suffered any such disability . He has worked out a novel strategy to define when to activate his living trust  --  a document that designates people to manage his affairs if he no longer can . He has named his wife and his three closest friends to a competency committee , and granted them the power to declare him unfit and take control . Says Hankin : " I want to be protected before I start trying to eat grapes off the wallpaper . " <P> That 's a worry many boomers bear for themselves and their parents . And they worry about a range of mental incapacity that can begin far short of full-blown dementia . Your infirm father may no longer be capable of managing investments , but he may do fine balancing his checkbook . How will it be decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks like us  --  have lost the capacity to drive a car or consent to surgery ? <P> This question is growing more urgent now that octogenarians  --  nearly 30% of whom suffer from Alzheimer 's  --  are the fastest growing segment of society . More Americans are doing advanced planning , with living trusts and durable powers of attorney for health and wealth , to spell out who should take over when they have lost capacity . Many would prefer to have others take charge of their affairs a little at a time as needed , rather than all at once . That 's the intent of the customized conservatorship that Hankin designs for clients  --  facilitated by the terms of a pioneering state law that he helped craft . <P> But most states do n't have laws as sophisticated as California 's . And even in that state , anyone trying to protect his interests through a conservatorship must place great trust in the conservators whom he names  --  and in an unknown judge who will be assigned to oversee the conservators , and who often will rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about when someone is " losing it " and exactly how much of " it " he has lost . <P> Fourteen states have adopted some portion of the American Bar Association 's Uniform Guardianship Act , which tries to define competency by functional abilities rather than a blanket medical diagnosis . These laws are designed to make it easier to define competency objectively . They also facilitate tailoring guardianships or conservatorships to specific needs . But such arrangements are still difficult to accomplish in practice . Erica Wood , associate staff director of the ABA 's commission on legal problems of the elderly , says that in many cases , " the judge virtually gives over his or her decision to the doctor , who is usually not a specialist . " <P> A few physicians use a " functional brain scan " to measure a general loss in function . " This is often useful in persuading the patient that something is wrong , " says Dr. Stephen Read , a Los Angeles psychiatrist . But the scan ca n't make fine distinctions between , say , the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
