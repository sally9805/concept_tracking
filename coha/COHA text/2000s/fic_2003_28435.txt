Patrick slammed the phone down and shot back his chair , narrowly missing the dog 's tail . Ever the optimist , the dog leapt to his feet , anticipating a walk , but Patrick shook his head . " Sorry , Dog , not this time , " he muttered , snagging his jacket off the back of the chair and heading for the door . Still hopeful , those persuasive eyes watched him for the slightest encouragement , but Patrick lobbed him a biscuit and left him to it . This should n't take long . It never did - although last time he 'd felt almost sorry for the girl . He shook his head to dismiss thoughts of last time from his mind , and headed for the lift . If this young woman thought she was going to be any luckier than the other one at slapping a paternity suit on him , she had another think coming . She 'd have more luck with the lottery . Patrick knew every woman he 'd ever had an intimate relationship with - knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stranger was going to be able to hoodwink him into believing she 'd had his child . The lift doors slid open to reveal a young woman standing in the foyer with a screaming baby in her arms , and Patrick sighed inwardly . Was this a change of tack for the paternity punters ? The last one had also come armed with a screaming baby - to wear himdown , or tug his heartstrings ? Either way , it would n't work . It had n't then , despite her haunted eyes , and it would n't now . He was made of sterner stuff . " Mr. Cameron ? " Well , that made a change . At least she was n't calling him " Patrick , darling . " He studied her for a moment , taking in the soft silver-blonde hair scooped back into a ponytail , the clear , challenging eyes , the too-wide mouth devoid of lipstick , the snug jacket that showed off all too clearly her softly rounded breasts and slender waist . " Do I know you ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason regretting it . Stupid . She was just another money-grubbing little liar . She shifted the baby in her arms and the screaming settled to a steady grizzle . Still rocking the infant gently , she looked up at him with those clear grey eyes that seemed to search into the deepest recesses of his soul and find him wanting . " No - no , you do n't know me , " she said , and her voice surprised him , low and mellow and distracting . " You knew my sister , though - Amy Franklin . She came to see you a few weeks ago with the baby . " Ah . " And I told her I 'd never seen her before in my life . " " And I do n't believe you , " she said softly , her eyes accusing . " I 've got evidence - " " Excuse me - is that your car ? " They both turned and looked at his receptionist , Kate , who was pointing through the plate-glass doors . Right outside , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busily winching the remains of an ancient lipstick pink Citron 2CV up into the air . " Good grief , " he said weakly . It looked straight out of the 1960s hippy era . The tatty paintwork was smothered in huge psychedelic flowers , and as it was raised into the air the driver 's door fell open and swung gently in the wind , releasing a trail of paper cups and sweet wrappers that rained down like confetti on the man beneath . " How dare he ? " Thrusting the baby at him , the young woman turned on her heel and headed for the door , marching out with hands on hips and haranguing the unfortunate truck driver , arms flailing like a windmill as she gesticulated wildly at the dangling car . " Oh , good grief , " Patrick said again , and , handing the screaming baby to his bewildered receptionist , he went outside , extracting his wallet and wondering what this little fiasco was going to cost him . Far more than the car was worth , without a shadow of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land the poor guy one by accident and get herself arrested . " I 'm sorry , this young lady was just trying to gain access to our car park , but the car stalled and she could n't get it going again . She 'd just come in to call a recovery vehicle , " he ad-libbed , shouldering her none too gently out of the way and stepping between them . " Perhaps I could reimburse you for your trouble ... " The man , burly and immovable , gave a dismissive snort . " Sorry , mate . Rules is rules . I have to remove it , it 's causing an obstruction . She 'll have to collect it from the pound - not that it 's worth it . I mean , what is it worth ? A tenner ? Fifty quid for the rarity value ? Personally , if it was n't for the fact that you have to pay the fine anyway , I would n't bother . " Personally , nor would he , but , then , it was n't his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - this fine you 're talking about ? " she asked , elbowing herself back in front of him with a sharp dig in the ribs . Not as sharp as her intake of breath , however , at the driver 's reply . " That 's obscene ! " she exclaimed , but he just shrugged . " Should have used a meter , love . Wouldn't 've happened then . " " But it broke down ! " she wailed , latching onto Patrick 's fabrication like a real pro . " You heard the man ! " " And pigs fly . Look , love , I ca n't winch it back down , I 've done the paperwork and it 's more than my - " " Job 's worth , " she and Patrick said in unison . The man 's face hardened into implacability . " It 's all right for you lot that do n't have to worry about money , " he said . Patrick sighed and rammed a hand through his hair , but his companion did n't pause for breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bracket me with him ! I worry about money constantly , and I have n't got any to throw around - hence my worthless car ! You ca n't take it ! " And then , with a masterly touch of pathos , she added , " Besides , it 's got all the baby 's things in it - I need them ! She 's hungry . " " Baby ? What baby ? " The man eyed the car worriedly , and Patrick could almost hear her mind working , but then she took pity on him . " Do n't worry , I had the baby with me - but all her things are still in the car , you ca n't take them away , I need to feed her . " The driver sighed , clearly relieved that he was n't dangling a tiny baby in the car above their heads , and winched it back down with a resigned shake of his head . " Look , lady , I should n't do this , but I 'll give you a minute to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But I want my car . " " Just do what he says , " Patrick advised her softly , eyeing the huge traffic jam that was building up behind the truck . " You can always get the car later . " " If I can find the money , you mean , " she muttered . " And anyway , how am I supposed to get the baby home without a car ? " Patrick 's heart sank . Here we go , he thought , feeling the contents of his wallet slipping further out of his grasp with every second . " Do n't worry about that now . Just get your stuff . " Just ? Huh ! Five minutes later , the elegant marbled foyer of his empire was littered with a pile of junk which in total was probably worth less than the loose change in his pocket , and the Franklin girl was standing in the doorway with a ticket in her hand , staring dispiritedly after her vanishing car .
