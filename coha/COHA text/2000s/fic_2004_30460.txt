Strange but True Chapter One Almost five years after Ronnie Chase 's death , the phone rings late one windy February evening . Ronnie 's older brother , Philip , is asleep on the foldout sofa , because the family room has served as his bedroom ever since he moved home from New York City . Tangled in the sheets  --  among his aluminum crutch , balled-up Kleenexes , TV Guides , three remote controls , and a dog-eared copy of an Anne Sexton biography  --  is the cordless phone . Philip 's hand fumbles in the dark until he dredges it up by the stubby antenna and presses the On button . " Hello . " A faint , vaguely familiar female voice says , " Philip ? Is that you ? " Philip opens his mouth to ask who 's calling , then stops when he realizes who it is : Melissa Moody , his brother 's high school girlfriend . His mind fills with the single image of her on prom night , blood splattered on the front of her white dress . The memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is an expression all of the Chases will find themselves wearing on their faces in the coming days , beginning with this very phone call . " Missy ? " " Sorry , it 's late . Did I wake you ? " Philip stares up at the antique schoolhouse clock on the wall , which has ticked and ticked and ticked in this rambling old colonial for as long as he can remember , though it never keeps the proper time . Both hands point to midnight , when it 's only ten-thirty . Back in New York City , people are just finishing dinner or hailing cabs , but here in the Pennsylvania suburbs , the world goes dead after eight . " I 'm wide awake , " Philip lies . " It 's been a long time . How are you ? " " Okay , I guess . " He hears the steady whoosh of cars speeding by in the background . There is a thinly veiled tremble in her voice that tells him she is anything but okay . " Is something the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parents . " If she wants to talk to his father , she 'll have to track him down in Florida where he lives with his new wife , Holly  --  the woman his mother refers to simply as The Slut . But Philip does n't bother to explain all that , because there is too much to explain already . " What do you want to talk about ? " Before Missy can answer , his mother 's heavy footsteps thunder down the stairs . A moment later , she is standing at the edge of the foldout bed , her worn-out white nightgown pressed obscenely against her doughy body . A few nights before , Philip had caught the second half of About Schmidt on cable . Now he thinks of the scene where Kathy Bates bares all before getting in the hot tub  --  this moment easily rivals that one . He shifts his gaze to his mother 's curly gray hair springing from her head in all directions like a madwoman  --  which is fitting , because to Philip , she is a madwoman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip says into the phone , then to his mother , " it 's Missy . " " Melissa ? Ronnie 's girlfriend ? " Philip nods . And then there is that expression : her eyebrows arch upward , her mouth drops into an O , as though she too has been spooked by the horrible memory of Melissa 's prom dress splattered with Ronnie 's blood . " What does she want ? " He gives an exaggerated shrug , then returns his attention to Melissa . " Sorry . My mom just woke up and wanted to know who was on the phone . " " That 's okay . How is she anyway ? " All the possible answers to that question rattle around in his mind . There is the everyday fact of his father 's absence , his mother 's binge eating and ever-increasing weight , her countless pills for blood pressure , cholesterol , anxiety , and depression . But all he says is , " She 's fine . So what do you want to talk to us about ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sometime ? " " Sure . " " When would be good ? " Philip thinks of his life in New York , the way he asked perfect strangers over to his camper-size studio in the East Village at all hours . The buzzer was broken , so he had to instruct each one to yell from the street . " How about now ? " he hears himself say into the phone . " Now ? " Melissa says . He waits for her to tell him that it 's too late , too dark , too cold . But she takes him by surprise . " Actually , I 've waited too long to tell you this . So now sounds good to me . " After they say good-bye , Philip presses the Off button and tosses the cordless back into the rumpled mess of the bed . The skin beneath his cast itches , and he jams two fingers into the narrow pocket of space just above his kneecap , scratching as hard as he can . His mother stares down at him as an onslaught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something and she can not stop : " Are n't you going to tell me what 's going on ? I mean , why the hell would that girl call here after all this time ? What , she does n't know how rude it is to phone someone so late ? For Christ 's sake , are n't you going to answer me ? " Philip quits scratching and pulls his fingers free from the cast , which looks more like an elongated ski boot with an opening for his bruised toes at the bottom , instead of the plain white casts kids used to autograph when he was in high school only a decade ago . " If you shut up for a second , I 'll answer you . " His mother crosses her arms in front of her lumpy breasts , making a dramatic show of her silence . The other night he 'd watched Inside the Actors Studio and one of those actresses with three names ( he could never keep track of who was who ) had talked about playing her part for the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone through life these last five years , Philip thinks , her every move broad enough for the people in the cheap seats .
