COATS The strongest coats this season are punched-up classics : the biker-chic bomber ( collar turned up , of course ) at Burberry Prorsum , Prada , and Balenciaga ; a peacoat in brilliant cobalt blue at Viktor &; Rolf ; and Sgt. Pepper military coats at Marc Jacobs . The most dramatic : sweeping maxis at Donna Karan and Calvin Klein . KNITS &; LAYERS Cozy , chunky sweaters are always a must , but this time designers have literally gone loopy for knits . Most notable : the inches-thick , shag-rug styles at Balenciaga and Helmut Lang . ( Word is most will be toned down when they hit the stores . ) Boyfriend sweaters such as Stella McCartney 's have a comfy appeal , while John Galliano let the rainbow be his guide with his Peruvian pieces . Layering , which incorporated knits , T-shirts , scarves , and coats , was more girlie than grunge on the runways of Marc Jacobs and Marni . FUR Fur and fall go hand in hand , but this year , it turned up in unexpected places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford 's Gucci runway . There were gaiters and a bag at Michael Kors and a swishy ( yes , fur swishes ) skirt at Sonia Rykiel . More traditional takes included cropped bombers at Prada and Louis Vuitton , oversize overcoats at Chanel and Dolce &; Gabbana , and slashed , floor-sweeping capes at Fendi . DENIM The newly minted perennial got a fresh spin in the form of skintight jeans at Lagerfeld Gallery and Michael Kors , and urban patchwork at Versus . SUITS Skinny legs and all . That was the message designers trotted down the runways in the form of superslim suits complete with narrow shoulders and stovepipe pants ( or pencil skirts  --  the choice is yours ) . Cut in everything from velvet to tweed to corduroy , the suits look freshest when paired with nothing at all . The biggest news is the shrunken jacket , often singlebreasted and single-buttoned . METALLIC From a flash to full-on-silver and gold add a rich element to both evening and day looks . LADY The abundance of pencil skirts , proper belted coats , satin blouses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lace are part of the I-am  --  woman attitude that dominated several collections . Whether it 's an outwardly demure Hitchcock heroine ( Louis Vuitton , Prada ) or a kohl-eyed Theda Bara vamp ( Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche , Gucci ) , there are enough ladylike looks to speak to the sexy yet prim side in all of us . PANTS &; SKIRTS After a spring in which designers were trumpeting big ! easy ! pants , fall 's slim silhouette is refreshingly welcome . Legs were long and lean at Balenciaga ; at Gucci , sexy satin stovepipe pants ruled ; and at Marc Jacobs , the trousers were cut narrow and cropped . Face it : Thin is always in . For skirts , the biggest news is the return of the pencil shape . Shown with ladylike blouses ( Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche and Prada ) , this is the look-sexy-in-an-instant piece of the season . Short , flippy skirts flirted on the Chanel and Luella runways . Meanwhile , the fuller peasant skirt from spring has been cropped to knee-length-a welcome and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spring , so it is n't surprising that black and moody are two key fall adjectives . Some designers have fallen hard for the Edwardian era with black satin and jetbeaded gowns ( Junya Watanabe ) , while others feminized Etonian/Oscar Wilde looks ( Ralph Lauren ) . Meanwhile , the even darker , slightly witchy Gothic look , which has been slowly simmering under the surface for a couple of years , came to a boil with Stevie Nicks results at Gucci and full-on madness at Alexander McQueen . COLLAGE Using part cubist construction and part plain old patchwork , designers played with patterns , textures , and colors on everything from abstract vests to classic ball gowns . EVENING Satiny , opulent , ' ' 30s-era Carole Lombard gowns , some with deco details , swaggered down the runways with major glamour effect . There was plenty of sleek black and subdued navy , but pale , shimmering golds , peachy pinks , and emerald greens also proved to be standouts . DETAILS If you buy one new accessory for fall , make it a long , chunky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball and knitted caps , while jewelry ranges from Goth crosses to architectural silver earrings . BAGS After a few quiet seasons , bags are back in the limelight , with clutches at Prada , slouchy shapes at Celine and Dolce &; Gabbana , and oversize carry-ons at Miu Miu and Tod 's . SHOES There are two shoe musts this fall : a high heel with a rounded toe , and a tougher , more aggressive boot . Other favorites include sexy , tie-me-up stilettos and demure kitten heels . <p>
