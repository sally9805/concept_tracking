The boy 's name was Santiago . Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church . The roof had fallen in long ago , and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood . He decided to spend the night there . He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate , and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night . There were no wolves in the region , but once an animal had strayed during the night , and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it . He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down , using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow . He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books : they lasted longer , and made more comfortable pillows . It was still dark when he awoke , and , looking up , he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had had the same dream that night as a week ago , and once again he had awakened before it ended . He arose and , taking up his crook , began to awaken the sheep that still slept . He had noticed that , as soon as he awoke , most of his animals also began to stir . It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life tothat of the sheep , with whom he had spent the past two years , leading them through the countryside in search of food and water . " They are so used to me that they know my schedule , " he muttered . Thinking about that for a moment , he realized that it could be the other way around : that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule . But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken . The boy prodded them , one by one , with his crook , calling each by name . He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of his books that had made an impression on him , or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields . Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed . But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing : the girl , the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days . He had been to the village only once , the year before . The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop , and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence , so that he would not be cheated . A friend had told the boy about the shop , and he had taken his sheep there . " I need to sell some wool , " the boy told the merchant . The shop was busy , and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon . So the boy sat on the steps of the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know shepherds knew how to read , " said a girl 's voice behind him . The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia , with flowing black hair , and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors . " Well , usually I learn more from my sheep than from books , " he answered . During the two hours that they talked , she told him she was the merchant 's daughter , and spoke of life in the village , where each day was like all the others . The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside , and related the news from the other towns where he had stopped . It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep . " How did you learn to read ? " the girl asked at one point . " Like everybody learns , " he said . " In school . " " Well , if you know how to read , why are you just a shepherd ? " The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on telling stories about his travels , and her bright , Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise . As the time passed , the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end , that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days . He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before : the desire to live in one place forever . With the girl with the raven hair , his days would never be the same again . But finally the merchant appeared , and asked the boy to shear four sheep . He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year . And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village . He was excited , and at the same time uneasy : maybe the girl had already forgotten him . Lots of shepherds passed through , selling their wool . " It does n't matter , " he said to his sheep . " I know other girls in other places . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he knew that shepherds , like seamen and like traveling salesmen , always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering . The day was dawning , and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun . They never have to make any decisions , he thought . Maybe that 's why they always stay close to me . The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia , they would be his friends . Yes , their days were all the same , with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk ; and they had never read a book in their young lives , and did n't understand when the boy told them . . .
