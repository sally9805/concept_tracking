" ' My beloved is mine , and I am his . . . . ' " Thea turned back a page and ran her finger down the thin leaf of the old Bible until she found the passage she had flagged . " ' Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth : for thy love is better than wine . ' " <p> Xavier 's response was quick . " ' Thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my spouse ; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of thy neck . How fair is thy love , my sister , my spouse ! How much better is thy love than wine ! ' " <p> Thea 's gaze lit on another passage from the Song of Solomon . " ' By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not . ' " <p> There was a moment of silence and then she heard Xavier 's book snap shut . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Agreed . " Thea shifted the mouthpiece of her phone . " When you suggested that we read the Bible together I did n't expect it would be quite so stimulating . " <p> " Then you underestimate how much I miss you . " Xavier 's voice sounded low and deep in her ear , as if only inches  --  not thousands of miles  --  separated them . <p> " And I you . " <p> " Hm . " She knew that when Xavier tempered his response with a thoughtful sound or even silence , he was thinking deeply . " So then , it 's time we did something about that . What do you think ? " <p> " What I think  --  " Thea broke off . What I think is that eighteen months is a ridiculously long time to be engaged to a man who has spent most of that time as far from me as possible . But she did n't want to sound unsure . " Are you ready to come home ? " <p> " Are you ready to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The moment the words were out she wished she had n't been so impulsive . They had talked often of marriage but had not yet set a date . <p> His chuckle reassured her . " The lady 's anxious . " <p> " The lady 's forty-five years old , Xavier Thornton . A woman my age has only so many good years left . " <p> " Oh , I plan to make best use of all those left , and quite a few of the lesser best years , besides . " <p> Thea closed her eyes . " So then , I can make plans ? " <p> " Plan away . But keep it simple . " He paused . " I 've had an answer from the letter I sent the bishop . I had asked him to find me a church placement as soon as possible and he has found one . So I 'm coming home to check it out as well . " <p> " Oh , Xavier , that 's wonderful . " Even if he did n't say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy he was coming back . She supposed she should be beyond such silly feminine sentiments but what woman in love ever was ? <p> " I hope you will think so , Thea . I 've asked for a modest appointment . There wo n't be a St. James Jubilee Crown of Heaven Tabernacle or sizable congregation or . . . " <p> Thea 's thoughts strayed away from his explanation when she glanced down at the engagement ring on her finger . It represented a love that had survived greater odds than they had any right to expect . Even I had my moments of doubt . <p> When she tracked down Xavier in Cabo San Lucas last year , after he had disappeared following the renunciation of his wealth and his position as pastor of a powerful church in Atlanta , she was n't at all certain that they had a future . She had n't immediately opened the ring box Xavier had placed in her palm that weekend after they 'd made love . Even after he 'd asked her to marry him , and she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear a symbol that so conspicuously announced to the world her plans to make Xavier Thornton a permanent part of her life . A three carat diamond elicited a lot of comments , especially from other women . And she was by nature a private person . <p> Not every couple that falls in love needs to marry . A lot could change in a year , even if she were certain . But now Xavier was coming home ! <p> " . . . all that aside , " Xavier 's voice drew Thea back into their conversation , " I must have a job if I 'm to provide , however simply , for a wife . Are you fine with that ? " <p> As he fell silent , Thea realized she might have missed something important . Yet she was n't about to admit she was n't paying attention . Better she should try to finesse the moment . " Are you trying to tell me your prospects are limited ? " <p> " Limited to what God will provide . " His answer carried an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God into conversations . She never felt completely comfortable doing that . It made her self conscious , except when talking with him . But , at the moment , she was a bride-to-be teasing her groom . <p> " So then , it 's a good thing that I have been a faithful contributor to my IRAs . " <p> His familiar silence seemed suddenly tense . " I will not ask you to share my vow of poverty . " <p> " Poverty ? " She whispered the word . <p> " So , if you need more time or . . . " <p> " No . " She took a breath instead of asking how small a stipend he was expecting . Xavier had placed his considerable fortune in a blind trust , yet she had assumed that he would eventually return to the life , if not the lifestyle , he had abandoned . Even if he did n't . . . <p> " How about an August wedding ? " She crossed her fingers like a child . " You think you can be home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home to you for good . " There was a smile in his voice again . <p> " Then it 's settled . A wedding in two weeks ! " She had a good career , savings , and investments ; they would survive . <p> " You better call my sisters . You know how they like to be part of my life plans . " <p> <br> Continues ...
