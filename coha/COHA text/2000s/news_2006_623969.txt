<p> Critics have called Gap 's clothing too boring , too ubiquitous , too inconsistent , too fashion-forward . <p> And while it is hard to know which , if any , of these complaints is accurate , the San Francisco retailer is finally conceding that there is something wrong with its merchandise . <p> After coming out of the holiday season with double-digit sales declines at stores open at least a year for Gap and Old Navy  --  along with a more-modest decline at Banana Republic  --  company executives have been increasingly taking responsibility for the slump and promising to turn things around . <p> " I 'll be honest , our teams thought we would see a bit more traction in fall and in holiday than we did , and so what that tells us is that we 've got a lot more to do to get this product right , " said Byron Pollitt , Gap executive vice president and chief financial officer , at an SG Cowen investor conference last week in New York . <p> Gap is now focusing on autumn to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand and return only when there is a sale . <p> " They know they 're doing something wrong . I think they 've been very open about that , " said Annette McEvoy , a retail consultant for McEvoy Associates in New York . " They 're trying to address the problem through better fashion . Right now they do n't have a look that would cause them to grow . The fashion is pretty ordinary . " <p> The company reported a 20 percent plunge in third-quarter profit heading into the holidays , earning $212 million for the three months ending Oct. 29 , compared with $265 million the year before . Same-store sales , a key measure of a company 's health , tumbled 7 percent , marking its largest three-month drop since the second quarter of 2002 . <p> On Thursday , the stock closed at $17.19 , a sharp drop from early 2000 , when it peaked at $53.75 . Gap will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 24 , and is sticking to its forecast that it will earn $1.12 to $1.17 per share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's original division , has received the harshest criticism . In December , same-store sales fell by 10 percent , compared with a 1 percent gain the year before in the same period . <p> Christine Chen , an analyst for Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco , blames the sales decline on what she sees as an inconsistent message . <p> " The customer has gotten too confused by Gap 's merchandise that they 've stopped shopping there , " said Chen , who does not own any shares of the company . <p> Chen said the brand has introduced fabrics that are softer but lower quality while mixing synthetic material with natural fibers , all of which makes it difficult for customers to justify the price unless it is marked down . <p> Last year , the brand saw some key senior management changes as part of an effort to turn things around . In April , Cynthia Harriss filled the crucial vacancy of president after the position had been left open for eight months . In October , Charlotte Neuville took over as executive vice president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also hired China Young as vice president of Gap accessories and Cheryl Benedict as vice president of women 's design . <p> Focus on individual items <p> Harriss , an enthusiastic cheerleader for the brand despite its woes , pointed to several initiatives intended to polish Gap 's image , including a more focused message that promotes individual items rather than making a broad fashion statement . <p> The company is in the middle of its left-weave jeans campaign , plastering store windows with arrows pointing to the left . Left-weave jeans are made with machines that weave to the left instead of the right , creating a softer feel . Harriss said Gap decided to bring the concept to the United States after enjoying success in Europe . <p> The campaign steers Gap back to jeans , which some retail experts say the company has neglected at a time when it can not afford to . <p> " The denim market has been such a hot market , yet the Gap has not been able to capitalize on it , " said Wendy Liebmann , president of WSL Strategic Retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond the left-weave jeans , Harriss said that Gap plans to introduce some of the new fashions in July to get a jump on the autumn season , which is crucial for back-to-school shopping and also serves as a preview to the even more crucial holiday season . The company will continue promoting denim in all forms , including slim-fitting jeans and floor-length skirts , as well as knits and hoodies . <p> Harriss said although evidence of Gap 's renewed efforts will show up in its summer offerings , the true measure will come in autumn . " We 're really excited about the product , " she said . <p> On Wednesday , the company announced plans to expand its Gap and Banana Republic brands to Singapore and Malaysia . Domestically , it has rolled out 20 remodeled Gap stores in Denver , San Diego , Colorado and New York , along with one in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto . The new look includes dark-colored wood floors , coffee tables , softer lighting and spacious fitting rooms . Harriss said the company expects to renovate stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite all the changes , however , some retail experts remain cautious about the company . Although they agree that the remodeled stores , for instance , could lead to a better shopping experience for customers , it does not address the Gap brand 's core problem : its merchandise . <p> " The No. 1 concern is merchandise  --  they got ta fix the merchandise , " said Christine Chen , the analyst for Pacific Growth Equities . " They got ta get people to think the merchandise is cool again . " <p> At the center of the criticism is President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Pressler , who in 2002 replaced longtime veteran Mickey Drexler . <p> Drexler , who now heads J. Crew , had seen Gap through years of prosperity before leaving it after two years of monthly same-store sales declines . <p> Pressler , a former Disney executive , has been credited with restoring the company to financial health , reeling in operating expenses , tightening inventory and improving product flow . At the same time , he has been accused of ignoring Gap 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question whether he should head the company . <p> Chen said that although Pressler has made his share of mistakes , removing him as CEO would not do the company any good . <p> " I do n't think replacing him fixes things , " Chen said . " It would send a signal that change is under way but it does n't mean a turnaround would happen . " <p> Richard Jaffe , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus , said that in the years that Drexler served as Gap president , starting in 1987 while founder Don Fisher served as CEO , the company enjoyed a balance of power between the creative side and the financial side . Drexler knew his customers and what they wanted , while Fisher deftly managed the numbers , Jaffe said . <p> In 1995 , Fisher stepped aside and Drexler took over as CEO while continuing to serve as president , leaving him with less oversight of the company 's day-to-day merchandising decisions . In 2000 , the company alienated Gap loyalists by introducing edgier fashion designed for a younger crowd , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jaffe said that by replacing Drexler with Pressler , Gap has left a creative void . <p> " Instead of the company being led at the top by a merchant and an operator , it 's being led by a corporate team , " said Jaffe , who does not own any shares of Gap . " In hindsight , could they have hired someone better ? Maybe . But I do n't think they 'll find another Drexler . " <p> Jaffe added that the structure may turn out to be the right one , with Pressler focusing on operations and cash flow so that the company can take risks with fashion . <p> " Maybe that 's Pressler 's role today , " he said . " The challenge is to find the creative .
