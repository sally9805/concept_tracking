If you want to understand the gold rush , you 've got to know the prospectors . The reason that Laredo and nearby McAllen , Texas , are two of the top 10 fastest-growing metro areas in the U.S. is mainly owing to NAFTA and its progeny : NAFTA Man . <P> NAFTA Man is not only bilingual , he 's also bicultural . He speaks Spanish on the factory floor in Mexico but yells in English at his kids ' T-ball games . He knows when to offer a bribe in Mexico ( to a traffic cop ) and when not to ( during an environmental inspection ) . He prefers chile rellenos to pot roast , gets his allergy medicine in Mexico but his MRI in the U.S. He has a two-sided wallet for pesos and dollars and would practically kill for a cell phone that works in both countries . " We do n't know who we are , " laughs John Castany , president of the Reynosa Maquiladora Association , which has 110 mostly gringo members . " We 're schizo . Border culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAFTA Men  --  and a few women  --  are genetically engineered by the new border economy . Managers are taught to take a different route to work every day to foil potential kidnappers . They grow accustomed to training  --  and losing  --  an entire factory floor of workers every year . And they have discovered that " casual Friday " in McAllen is often a dress-up workday on the other side . Around here , the most valuable asset is their flexibility . " You have to switch gears in Mexico  --  and not just languages . You have a behavior shift too , " says Charles Taliaferro , 49 , who runs maquila operations for Am-Mex Products , which makes everything from Siemens electric motors to Smead file folders . Workers cause less trouble , but their bosses have to be more considerate . " In Mexico , you 're more polite , more formal , " he says . <P> The man most responsible for NAFTA Man 's ascendance in McAllen is a former Catholic priest turned economic hustler named , coincidentally , Mike Allen . As president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local tax funds to attract business to McAllen  --  as well as to its Mexican sister city , Reynosa , across the vein-thin river . " I remember back in ' 88 meeting the mayor of Reynosa . He had an AK-47 in his back seat . We did a handshake deal to bring manufacturers to Mexico , " says Allen . Back then , Reynosa had fewer than 20 factories , with 16,000 employees ; today there are 209 plants , with 64,000 workers . <P> Critics point out that the Mexican maquilas have drained jobs from the U.S. side . Allen says those jobs were leaving anyway . And even though the Rio Grande Valley remains one of the nation 's poorest regions , a lucrative new companion industry  --  logistics and technical support  --  has helped boost job growth 7% last year in the McAllen area , the best in Texas . The 2,000 mostly American maquila professionals who cross the bridge daily into Reynosa bring in $1 million a year in tolls alone for the city of McAllen . " If Reynosa is not doing well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing well . "
