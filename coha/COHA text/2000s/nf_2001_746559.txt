Section : JUDICIAL SYSTEM States are out to lure cyber companies by offering them their own bench <p> Using the court system to entice business to a state is nothing new . Delaware created the Court of Chancery more than 200 years ago , and for decades businesses have incorporated there , lured , among other things , by a system that specializes in the complexities of corporate litigation . <p> As recently as 1995 , the New York state court system opened a commercial division to expedite complex civil disputes in hopes of attracting corporations to the state . <p> Enter the New Economy , somewhat deflated after the ballooning of high-tech companies over the last few years . Nevertheless , politicians are still courting emerging technology businesses to settle within their borders . <p> Two states are pioneering yet another clever way to woo that sector  --  emulating the successes of Delaware and New York by involving the courts in their plight . M &M; on Track <p> Maryland and Michigan are the two jurisdictions at the forefront of making technology cases a priority within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate program for technology-related litigation , the two states hope to route these matters to specially trained state judges presiding in fully wired courtrooms . <p> Procedurally , the states ' proposals differ . Yet their intent is the same . Instead of languishing for years in the court system with other litigation matters , technology-related cases will get expedited and be heard by tech-savvy judges within months of being filed . <p> " The goal is to speed up the process , " says Detroit attorney Jeffrey G. Raphelson , chair-elect of the State Bar of Michigan 's Computer Law Section . According I to Raphelson , it takes an average of 18 months for cases to get to trial in Michigan . That is an entire life span for some Internet startups , which can rise or fall in less time . <p> Courts must become responsive to changes in the business world , says Towson , Md. , lawyer Robert D. Kalinoski , chair of the Maryland State Bar Association 's Business Law Section . " Because of the accelerating rate of technological change , it is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Kalinoski . " You ca n't have wise decisions from judges scratching their heads because they have no clue what the tech lingo means . " <p> Last year , Maryland 's General Assembly passed a bill appointing a task force of members of the legal , business and academic communities . It proposed forming a business and technology case management track in lieu of a new court or a division . Under this plan , when a lawsuit is deemed a business/technology matter , it will be steered to this new track and be quickly heard by specially trained judges or mediators . <p> Such a tracking system is not new to Maryland , which already had independent tracks for different matters . So adding another was less of an obstacle than creating legislation and a physical structure to house a separate court or division . Maryland 's case management system categorizes each lawsuit early on and assigns it a schedule . <p> But unlike the new technology track , the four existing tracks are broken down not by subject matter but by a suit 's complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discovery will land in the " simple " track where the litigants must finish discovery in three to four months and a judge must hear the arguments within six to eight months . <p> " The rationale of various court personnel is , ' Let 's not create a monster . ' They would rather start smaller than larger , " says Rockville attorney James L. Thompson , past president of the Maryland State Bar Association . <p> Under the task force 's current initiative , the new track will only take cases seeking compensatory damages totaling $50,000 or more and arising out of technology and business-related disputes . Initially , there will be three judges trained for the program . Their opinions will be published on the Internet just as the appellate courts publish their opinions . <p> The task force also recommended that all cases assigned to the program be referred to alternative dispute resolution and that mediators be trained to handle them . <p> The implementation committee , headed by Prince George 's County Judge Steven I. Platt , is working out the final details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime in the fall . <p> " This is a recognition that there are new complex cases on the horizon , " says Gregory K. Wells , Maryland bar litigation section chair . <p> And more such cases are likely to come , regardless of the industry 's downturn . According to the task force , the state 's information technology industry added more than 18,000 tech jobs between 1993 and 1998 , bringing the total employment attributed to the industry to more than 100,000 . <p> Although more recent figures are not available , Maryland is going ahead with its plans despite the changing fortunes of the tech sector . " This phenomenon is here to stay , " says Kalinoski . " This is just the beginning of the infotech explosion . " More in Michigan <p> Michigan officials echo that sentiment . But unlike Maryland , the Michigan bench and bar are wary of the cyber court proposal . <p> The proposal in Michigan 's legislature is more ambitious than Maryland 's . In January , Gov . John Engler declared that he planned to create a cyber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where technology cases will be handled more quickly and efficiently . Eager to emulate the success of Delaware 's Court of Chancery , proponents say they want technology to become as much a mainstay of Michigan 's economy as the automobile industry . <p> " Michigan is making a major effort to attract e-business , " says Judge William G. Kelly , a member of the American Bar Association 's Judicial Division . " I think it is positive for the courts to use the technology of today to better deliver justice for all , " he says . <p> Under the proposal , all of the cyber court 's hearings and proceedings will be conducted by electronic communications such as audio , video and Internet conferencing . Out-of-state lawyers will be able to appear via video or audio in front of a Michigan judge without having to hire a local attorney . The intention is to accomplish the majority of the case , from e-filing to motions to trial , via computer rather than in the courtroom . <p> The plan calls for an independent court housed in a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the state 's trial courts in regard to subpoenas , requests for production , punishment for contempt , administering oaths and other court business . Proceedings will be open to the public and broadcast over the Internet when possible . <p> According to the bill , the cyber court will have concurrent jurisdiction over any commercial litigation where the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000 . Defendants will have the option of removing the action to the regular court system at any time before filing an answer with the cyber court clerk . Appeals will be conducted before a special panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals , as prescribed by the Michigan Supreme Court . <p> As of late May , the bill was in the Committee on Civil Law and the Judiciary in Michigan 's House of Representatives . <p> " It is a sexy sort of topic , so it is getting a lot of attention , " says Birmingham lawyer Daniel H. Minkus , chair of the Michigan bar 's business law section . " I think it is a great concept . It just has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan 's plan may take a while to implement . The State Bar of Michigan is actively supporting it with some conditions . Among them are the creation of an alternative noncyber court jurisdiction , should some parties wish to file cases there , and the stipulation that judge selection reflect the statewide composition of the bench . <p> Under the Michigan state constitution , judges must be elected . Yet , the enabling legislation states that the Michigan Supreme Court will assign judges to the cyber court . " This is clearly in consistent with our constitution and has to be corrected , " says Raphelson . <p> Critics are seeking other refinements . For one , jurisdiction needs to be more narrowly defined , they say . The plan calls for jurisdiction over all commercial disputes , a sweep that is too broad and unclear , says Raphelson . <p> And by championing such high-tech innovations as video conferencing and real-time transcripts , the proposal would allow out-of-state attorneys to practice law in Michigan 's cyber court . <p> In addition , the court system would require a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most modern equipment and to train judges , mediators and court officers to use that equipment is an expensive proposition , he says . <p> " It is a quantum leap forward for us in terms of technology in the courtroom , " adds Raphelson . Says Minkus , " I think it will get here one day , just in smaller steps . " <p> Gov . Engler remains optimistic . " America 's first cyber court will make Michigan uniquely attractive to the next generation of technology-driven companies , " he said in a statement . <p> " With it , Michigan has the potential to be to technology companies what Delaware has been to public corporations . " <p> But critics in both states have more general problems with cyber courts . In particular , some trial lawyers believe that cyber courts favor business litigants at the expense of others . " Every litigant wants swift justice , " says Minkus . " There is a concern out there that those who have money will now be able to buy swift justice , while the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Proponents counter that if technology disputes are taken out of the regular court system , that will lighten the docket and expedite all of the cases . <p> And , if a cyber court succeeds for business litigation , it might be expanded to other matters , like criminal and family law . <p> " It should be for Joe Six-Pack as well as for big business , " says Michigan Judge Kelly . " But , I believe that once we have the technology in place , other people will benefit from it , too . " No Marketing in Maryland <p> Critics also worry that justice is being bent to accommodate business interests and that judges will develop a pro-business bias . " The courts originally said we ca n't be part of a marketing campaign to attract businesses to Maryland . As judges we can not say ' Come and bring your business to Maryland , ' " notes Judge Platt . <p> " The perception that our judiciary is for sale is a real problem , " says Wells , who practices in Largo , Md @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business-friendly . That 's fine . But to promote our judges as business-friendly is not fine , " Wells says . <p> Ironically , the one state that both Michigan and Maryland are attempting to emulate  --  Delaware  --  does not have any special cyber court to attract emerging information technology companies . But what Delaware does have is a significant amount of up-to-date technology in its business courts as well as other state courts that is miles ahead of the competition . And this may be just enough to attract and keep new technology businesses . <p> The Delaware Court of Chancery has made docket information and pleadings available over the Internet for most civil , patent and bankruptcy cases . The virtual docket , as it is called , can be accessed with a password from any computer and modem . <p> In addition , all three of Delaware 's counties have video teleconferencing equipment for hearings and for administrative court meetings , according to Wilmington attorney Richard K. Herrmann , past chair of the Delaware State Bar Association 's Computer Law Section and a senior advisor to Courtroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In August 1999 , the state bar teamed up with private vendors to design and implement what it claims is the nation 's first actively used courtroom of the future . Designated the e-Courtroom , the Superior Court of Delaware uses this experimental courtroom located in Wilmington to hold civil trials and to try out new technologies . <p> To promote these innovations , Delaware has been educating both judges and lawyers about technology issues . <p> There are monthly seminars at the e-Courtroom and continuing education courses solely focusing on different technology topics , says Herrmann . And in September , the state bar is going to open a Technology Learning Center where vendors will train judges , lawyers and court staff on the equipment . <p> " I would like to think that all this has brought some prestige to Delaware , " says Herrmann . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : JUDGE STEVEN PLATT expects the technology hack in Maryland to be operational this fall . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> By Victoria Rivkin <p> <p> Victoria Rivkin is a lawyer and free-lance writer in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
