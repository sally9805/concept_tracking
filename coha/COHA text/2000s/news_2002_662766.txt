<p> Dennis Conner 's new $5 million sailboat slips out of one of the world 's busiest harbors and heads for another day of training , out beyond the freighters and oil derricks that dot the Pacific Ocean . <p> The America 's Cup challenger trials start Oct. 1 in Auckland , New Zealand , and there 's endless testing and training to do in the steady breezes off Long Beach to get the new Stars &; Stripes and its slightly older stablemate of the same name up to speed . <p> Something 's missing , though . Conner , the world 's best-known sailor , is n't among the 16-man crew . And no , he did n't fall overboard . <p> Conner rarely sails on his America 's Cup sloops anymore . Leading an unprecedented ninth campaign , he 's too busy trying to raise the staggering amount of money needed to compete for the 151-year-old trophy . Conner has won the America 's Cup four times , but not since 1988 . He 's also lost it twice . <p> Some days , he works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego . Most of the time he 's on the road , making his pitch in corporate boardrooms or to private sponsors . <p> " He still drives the team , " said Bill Trenkle , who 's sailed with Conner since 1980 and is director of operations for Team Dennis Conner . " So much of being successful is the strategy and the planning and making good choices , and that 's something that he 's really , really good at . He 's just not doing it from the boat . " <p> Conner , who turns 60 in September , is still listed as the team 's skipper , although he 's more like the CEO . For the second straight America 's Cup , Ken Read of Newport , R.I. , will steer Stars &; Stripes . <p> " At first , it was like Willie Mays patting you on the back and saying , ' Hey , can you take over for me in center field starting tonight ? ' " Read said before another long day on the water . " It was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend . <p> " He made it really easy , " the 40-year-old Read said . " Never any pressure , not even a threatening statement . I 've never had a ' I do n't think I 'd do it that way ' from him . " <p> Conner sailed in only three races in the 1999-2000 America 's Cup , when his underfunded , one-boat program fell one point short of forcing a sailoff for the second spot in the challenger finals . His team had earlier been penalized one point for using an illegal rudder . <p> " I 'd rather have Kenny 's job , " Conner said . " Of course I 'd rather be sailing the boat , but it 's not a perfect world . If I did n't raise the money , we would n't have a campaign . " <p> Since his crew began training off Long Beach in February , Conner has been out sailing only a handful of times . He does , however , remain the world 's top-ranked skipper in the smaller Etchells class . <p> " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first , in 1995 , to realize that this business has gone way beyond one person trying to do it all . If you try to do it all , you 're either not going to be able to raise the funds , or you 're going to do a lousy job , most likely , sailing . " <p> Conner made the finals in 1995 , but was routed by Team New Zealand off San Diego . <p> Nine challengers , with budgets ranging from $80 million to $100 million , will vie for the chance to face Team New Zealand in the finals in February . <p> Conner is a professional sailor , not a tycoon , and his budget is believed to be about $40 million . <p> Conner wo n't be specific , saying his budget is " as much as I can raise . It 's enough to pay for two nice sailboats and 70 people to go to work every day . " <p> This is the first time Conner has been able to afford more than one new boat since the 1986-87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after becoming the first American skipper in 132 years to lose it . <p> " Our program is quite strong compared to our programs in the past , " Conner said . " But the bar has been raised tremendously from that level . " <p> Conner is backed by the New York Yacht Club for the first time since his landmark loss in 1983 . The club 's commodore , Charlie Dana , thinks $40 million in Conner 's hands is worth $60 million to someone else . <p> " Dennis has proved to be extraordinarily resourceful and does not waste money , " Dana said . " Three of the last four America 's Cups have not been won by the wealthiest syndicates . Money sure helps , but it 's not always what wins the day . " <p> Conner probably has as good a chance as any to reach the America 's Cup finals opposite the Kiwis . <p> Although Conner has been viewed by outsiders over the years as a cutthroat competitor and a bully - he 's been nicknamed " Big Bad Dennis " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal . <p> Key sailors such as Trenkle , tactician Tom Whidden and navigator Peter Isler keep coming back . Eight of his sailors have a total of 14 America 's Cup victories among them , either with Conner or with America3 in 1992 . <p> Then there 's the team 's sparse compound , tucked into a corner of a vast container terminal . A sail loft , three modular trailers and eight cargo containers that have been converted into workshops are crammed onto a spit of land at the end of a pier that 's three-quarters of a mile long . <p> Giant cranes that unload container ships tower 350 feet overhead , making Conner 's two 80-foot sloops - with mainsails the size of a 747 wing - look rather small . <p> Since 1986-87 , Conner has named all his sloops Stars &; Stripes . The newest one , with sail number USA-77 , was launched in May . USA-66 , which also cost $5 million , was launched in February . Before USA-77 arrived , the team used a yacht from the last America 's Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained in Auckland , where it 's now winter , Conner chose to keep his team in Long Beach , where the weather 's good and the breeze blows between 8 and 25 knots . <p> The crews usually sail six days a week , often going out on long , drag-race tacks to test sails and equipment . Using one boat as a benchmark , sailors make changes on the other boat . By leapfrogging the changes , they can have both yachts as ready as possible for New Zealand 's unpredictable conditions . <p> " It is tedious , sailing along next to another boat for hours on end , but invaluable for a Cup campaign , " Isler said . " Another place a second boat is valuable is practicing racing . There is really no way to practice all the wild action in the start of an America 's Cup match race without having another boat to spar against . " <p> Although syndicates can only race one yacht at a time in the America 's Cup , it helps to have a backup boat . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank . In 1999 , one of Young America 's yachts cracked in two off Auckland and nearly sank . <p> Conner 's crew will move to Auckland at the end of July . No one will know until October how big of a gap , if any , there is between the big-money programs and ones like Conner 's . <p> " That 's why the drama is there , " Conner said . <p> " We absolutely know that we 're not a favorite , nor do we deserve to be a favorite , " Read said . " But at the same time , not one person here expects to lose , either . "
