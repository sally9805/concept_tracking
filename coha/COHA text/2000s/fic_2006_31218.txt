By Heart It is easy for a life to become unblessed . Mary , in particular , understood this . Her mistakes and they were legion were not lost on her . She knew all about the undoing of a life : take away , first of all , your people . Your family . Your lover . That was the hardest part of it . Then put yourself somewhere unfamiliar , where ( how did it go ? ) you are a complete unknown . Where you possess nothing . Okay , then this was the strangest part take away your history , every last bit of it . What else ? She discovered , despite what people may imagine , having nothing to lose is a lot like having nothing . ( But there was something to lose , even at this point , something huge to lose , and that was why this unknown , homeless state never resembled freedom . ) The unnerving , surprisingly creepy and unpleasantly psychedelic part you lose your name . Mary finally sat on a bed in a motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathless train ride under darkening skies and through increasingly unfamiliar landscape . Despite her anxiety she still felt lulled by the tracks clicking at intervals beneath the train ; an odd calm descended for whole minutes in a row until the train pulled into another station and she waited for someone to come over to her , finger-pointing , some unbending and unsmiling official . In between these moments of near calm and all the other moments , she practiced appearing normal . Only when she tried to move could you notice how shaky she was . That really undid her , her visible unsteadiness . She tried not to move . Five state borders , and then she was handingover the cash for the room anonymous , cell-like , quiet . She clutched her receipt in her hand , stared at it , September 15 , 1972 , and thought , This is the first day of it . Room Twelve , the first place of it . Even then , behind a chain lock in the middle of nowhere , she was double-checking doors and closing curtains . Showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push in as she stood there unaware and naked . Instead of sleeping she lay on the covers , facing the door , ready to move . Showers and bed , nakedness and sleep she felt certain that was how it would happen , she could visualize it happening . She saw it in slow motion , she saw it silently , and then she saw it quickly , in double time , with crashes and splintered glass . Have n't you seen the photos of Fred Hampton 's mattress ? She certainly had seen the photos of Fred Hampton 's mattress . They 'd all seen them . She could n't remember if the body was still in the bed in the photos , but she definitely remembered the bed itself : half stripped of sheets , the dinge stripe and seam of the mattress exposed and seeped with stains . All of it captured in the lurid black-and-white Weegee style that seemed to underline the blood-soak and the bedclothes in grabbed-at disarray . She imagined the bunching of sheets in the last seconds , perhaps to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against gunfire , of course , but against his terrible , final nakedness . " Cheryl , " she said aloud . No , never . Orange soda . " Natalie . " You had to say them aloud , get your mouth to shape the sound and push breath through it . Every name sounded queer when she did this . " Sylvia . " A movie-star name , too fake sounding . Too unusual . People might actually hear it . Notice it , ask about it . " Agnes . " Too old . " Mary , " she said very quietly . But that was her real name , or her original name . She just needed to say it . She sat on the edge of the bed , atop a beige chenille bedspread with frays and loose threads , in her terry-cloth bathrobe , which she 'd somehow thought to buy when she got her other supplies earlier in the afternoon . She had imagined a bath as bringing some relief , and the sink into the robe afterward seemed important . She did just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eyes trained on the open door of the bathroom , and careful not to splash , she strained to determine the origins of every sound she heard . She shaved her legs and scrubbed her hands with a small nailbrush , also purchased that day . She flossed her teeth and brushed her tongue with her new toothbrush . She tended to the usual grooming details with unusual attention : she knew instinctively that these details were very closely tied to keeping her sanity , or her wits , anyway . Otherwise she could just freeze up , on the floor , in her dirty jeans , drooling and sobbing until they came and got her . Dirt was linked to inertia . Cleanliness , particularly personal cleanliness , was an assertion against madness . It was a declaration of control . You might be in the midst of chaos , terrified , but the ritual of your self-tending radiated from you and protected you . That was where Mary figured a lot of people got it wrong . Slovenliness might be rebellious , but it was never liberating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to personal hygiene surrendered you to everything outside you , all the things not of you trying to get in . The TV on low , she looked but barely watched , hugging her knees toward her . Unpolished clean nails , uniform and smooth . Legs shaven and scented with baby oil , which looked greasy but smelled powdery and familiar . She inhaled deeply , resting her face on her knees and drawing her legs closer . She was a tiny ball of a human , was n't she ? A speck of a being in the middle of a vast , multihighwayed and many-sided country , was n't she ? Full of generic , anonymous and safe places just like this one . She thought of famous people 's names , authors ' names , teachers ' names , the names she made up when she was eight for her future babies . Abby , Blythe , Valerie . Vita , Tuesday , Naomi . She put on an oversized T-shirt and clean cotton bikini briefs decorated with large pastel pansies , size 4 . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women in novels . She ate peanut butter on white bread and drank orange juice directly from the carton . She was ravenous , very unusual for her . She took a large bite and a big swig , the sweet , pulpy taste mixing into the glutinous , sticky mouthful . She did n't finish swallowing before taking another huge bite . Maybe I 'll be a fat person in my new life . She started to laugh , and the peanut butter-bread-orange juice clump stuck momentarily in her throat , cutting off her airway . She imagined , indifferently , choking and dying in this motel room . She swallowed and then laughed even harder , out loud . It sounded crazy , her short , sudden laugh against the quiet mono sound of the television . She could hear her breath squeeze in and out of her lungs and throat . She turned up the volume on the television and stared hard at it . Jim Brown was talking to Dick Cavett . Brown wore a tight white jumpsuit with beige piping and a wide tan leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something out of oversized mugs , also white , and placed them on a mushroom-shaped white metal table between them . Brown smiled handsomely and kept declaring with exquisite enunciation his respect and support for his friend , the president . A piece of lined paper in a spiral notebook , a ballpoint pen . Karen Black . Mary Jo Kopechne . Joni Mitchell . Martha Mitchell . Joan Baez . Jane Asher . Joan is n't so bad . Linda McCartney . Joan McCartney . Joan Lennon . Oh , good , sure . Bobby would appreciate that . She almost waited for him to contact her but she knew he would not , not for a while , anyway . At eleven o'clock she turned the channel to watch the news , tried to see if he , or any of them , had been identified or arrested . Jane Fonda , Phoebe Caulfield , Valerie Solanas . She liked these names . Must n't reference her real name in any way . Brigitte , Hannah , Tricia . Just do n't get cute . Lady Bird . Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs . You are Freya from the edge , " Bobby had said . They sat cross-legged on a handwoven rug Bobby had bought in Spain . She spent many nights getting high kneeling on that rug ; she could examine it endlessly . Moorish Mbius patterns took you in dervish circles back to where you started but done in incongruous , rainy European colors muted greens and yellows next to imperial , regal and regimental looking banners and shieldlike things . The rug was n't authentic , but whoever made it had worked meticulously to evoke something authentic , studied relics of conquerings , exiles and colonies . It clashed and conflicted the way real things often did . It was the most beautiful thing either of them possessed , and they often sat on it , next to their bed , which was just a mattress on the floor with no frame or even box springs . All the kids she knew slept on the floor ; it softened the distinction between their bed and the rest of the world . She felt safer , nearer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people sit cross-legged on the floor , on beautiful rugs ? Were there horizontal and vertical cultures ? Was living closer to the earth free and natural , or was it simply meager ? Was it good , or better , or just different for someone ? " And what will you call me ? " she had asked , leaning her head against his back . He often wore sleeveless undershirts , very thin and slightly ribbed ; when she pressed against him he smelled both tangy and sweet . Pot and incense and sweat . She tried to conjure him , with her eyes closed , in her midnight bed . She thought Bobby looked exotic , handsome not so much in the total as in the details . The closer in she was , the more attractive he became . His skin had a faint yellow-green undertone that was the opposite of ruddy : skin so smooth under her touch that she could feel every tiny rough spot on her own fingers or lips ; skin so clear and fine she could see his blood pulse at wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever crazy about the random curliness of his long black hair , which grew out rather than down , she adored the silky way the hair slipped through her fingers when she pulled her hand through it , and the tension in his shoulders when she pressed against them , and how in candlelight she would see her white skin her slender hand , say against the dark skin of his broad back , and it would catch her off guard always , the contrast between them . She felt then exquisite and even fragile , which she liked . She was n't supposed to , but she did . Perhaps because they spent so much time together , and dressed alike and spoke alike even laughed alike it was great to in some palpable way be unalike . " Will you call me Mary , at least when we are home , in bed ? " " Only Freya . And you have to call me Marco . In these sorts of activities you ca n't use your real name . Ever . If you want to change your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nom de guerre ? Is n't that sort of ridiculous ? " " All cultures have naming ceremonies . You have a given name , but then you get a chosen name . It 's part of a transformation to adulthood . They tell you who you are , and then you decide who you are . It 's like getting confirmed , or getting married . " " But I did n't choose that name . You did . " " I 'm helping you . The first thing we do is make up a new name . A fighting , fearless name . " " A Bolshevik name ? " Mary said , frowning . " It 's a Nordic goddess name . A towering priestess name . A lightning bolt name . A name to live up to . " She closed her eyes and rested against him . " Okay . " " A name that exudes agitprop . These are always two-syllable names that end in a vowel . Freya , Maya , Silda . Marco , Proto , Demo . If you do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did use those names except in the press communiqus and on the telephone . Now she was choosing another name , its opposite a hidden , modest , meek name but truly choosing . The next morning ( was it morning ? ) , when she woke after hardly sleeping , she sat down in the one chair , a molded plastic affair in mustard yellow , next to the motel bed , in the dead time between showers and sleep , with nothing to do but indoctrinate herself into her new life . She could not leave until it was done . She wrote it all out on the piece of spiral notebook paper . Her age : twenty-two . Birthplace : Hawthorne , California . Name : Caroline . Hawthorne was just another suburban town in California , which you could bet was more like all the other suburban towns in California than it was different , and it would do just fine even if her favorite band was also from Hawthorne . And Caroline is a pretty girl 's name that also happened to be the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Okay , there was no point in being witty about any of this , encoding it or making it coherent in any way , except if it helped her remember . But as Bobby had warned her , if it is legible to you , then it gives you away . But everything , of course , means something . However hermetic and obscure , it ca n't fail to signify , can it ? Unless , of course , she wanted it somehow , however quietly , to be legible and coherent . Unless , of course , she wanted someone , at some time , to figure it out . ) Caroline . Caroline Sherman . Okay ? That first night , Caroline did n't know where Bobby had gone . Or when she would see him again . She knew only to get across state lines as soon as possible . Only then could she pause , anonymous in the great expanse of states between the two coasts , and hole up in a motel room composing her new life . They had agreed on Oregon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Coast . Bobby said he would contact her eventually . Go to Eugene , he said , and when and if things are cool I 'll get in touch . I 'll find you . Otherwise they had determined a fail-safe plan to meet at a designated spot at the end of next year . But surely they would see each other before then . He 'd get in touch when and if things cooled down . And if , he said . She fell asleep those first few nights committing the " facts " of her new identity to memory . And for a while it would be impossible not to be confused and self-conscious during even the most mundane exchanges . Do you drink coffee ? And she would have to think , Well , I always have , but now , well , maybe I do n't . And she would reply , " No , I never touch the stuff . " And the extra step of comparing the present with the past would keep her in a constant state of reaction . Until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that yet , could n't even imagine it . Yet one day she would have lived her new life so long that the conjuring of the old life would seem like a dream , an act of imagination . Eventually it would almost feel as though it had never happened . This was the way it was supposed to go down . A secret held so long that even you no longer believe it is n't really you . But at this point she had no idea that this could go on indefinitely . She had no idea she would find that her identity was more habit and will than anything more intrinsic . She had all her supplies . She pulled them one by one out of a brown knapsack and placed them on the bedspread . Blond hair dye . L'Oral Ash and Sass . Scissors . Cash . About four hundred dollars , all in twenties . This was her whole life , the sum of her past twenty-two years and the path into her future . A spiral notebook , blond hair , scissors , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black sweater , an oversized T-shirt , a bathrobe and a blue blouse . Three pairs of underwear , three pairs of socks , one pair of brown clogs . Silver earrings , antique , that Bobby gave her on their one-year anniversary . His grandmother 's . A watch her parents gave her for high school graduation a quartz Timex , a Lady Sport model with a khaki-colored canvas band . She should discard these , but she could n't . She had already discarded her phone book . She did that the night before , ripping her name off the front and burying it as deeply as possible in the big garbage bins outside the train station , pushing different pages through each swinging lid as discreetly as she could manage in the state she was in . Right before that she stood in the ladies ' room , feeling ill , looking one last time at the phone numbers and addresses of her parents and her few friends . She knew by heart all she needed anyway , still did . That was the first time that expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not intellectual or by rote but by heart . When Bobby and Mary first discussed the day they might have to go underground , it had actually sounded exciting . She could admit that . In case of emergency , you must do the following . The escape plan . Change name , hair color , clothes . Social Security number . Remember the first numbers must match where you say you are from . Do n't count on any luck . Count on bad luck . He made her go over all of it . She did n't really understand then that if it happened ( and yet they knew it would happen , did n't they ? ) , if all went well , all according to the plan , it would happen in silence and isolation . Unnoticed and unobserved . She would end up alone in an anonymous room somewhere with a pocked chenille bedspread and a watercolor landscape print in the same hues of mustard and green that were everywhere in the room and with only the TV on the broken swivel stand to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , she had her new identity worked out . She then needed to determine what should happen next not just how to evade detection but how to survive , to sustain herself for however long it would last . ( She did n't , at that point , define what " it " really was . She projected a few months into the future and then stopped . ) Caroline , a.k.a . Freya , a.k.a . Mary , did not count on luck but took stock of her advantages . She could see only two : One , she was a woman . Two , she was plain . She was not ugly , she was not pretty . But just that old-fashioned word , plain . If she left the room , or if you tried to recall her to others , or even yourself , the adjectives would be limited not hard to come up with but hardly worth the bother . Thin , yes ; neat , yes ; hair much more light brown than red , which also made it hard to describe , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and pinkish white body . Her skin tone gave off a peeled quality that left the line distinguishing lip from face indistinct , her pale eyebrows lost against the nearly same-colored forehead . Bobby once described her as looking like a heroine in a nineteenth-century novel . To her that meant sickly , bland looks that suggested small , prim virtues . " No . " Bobby laughed . " They would have said you have a noble physiognomy . " " Right . " " A pleasing countenance . " " What does that mean , exactly ? " " Uh , a good personality ? " He laughed and tried to kiss her . " How sweet . " She pulled away , frowning at him . He held her arm . She shrugged him off . " No , listen . " She did n't look at him but examined the floor , lips pursed . " You are so lovely , " he continued , his voice softer now . " True , it is n't a loud-volume effect ; it is subtle but quite deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him . He was staring at her so intently she looked back at the floor . She could feel herself flush . " You have a sort of I do n't really know how to explain it what you might call an undertow , if that makes any sense . The longer I 'm with you , the more I want to be with you . It gets harder and harder to imagine leaving you behind . It 's not about enchantment or seduction or anything as light as that . It is more like being held captive . It 's powerful and uncomfortable and gets worse all the time . " She could n't hear what he was saying . She just knew that her lover thought she was plain . But as Caroline she could put these two irrefutable facts together , plain and woman . It meant she could move somewhere new and go to the store or apply for a job and people would n't feel threatened or aroused . She knew she could go unnoticed . She could not recall her own face if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had caused her pain her whole life became an asset now , her anonymity her saving attribute . Her looks had finally found their perfect context as a fugitive . Born to it by being chronically forgettable . ( Which was also part of how she got in this position in the first place . Walking slowly , half smile on her face , clutching an innocuous purse , or a package , or a suitcase . Would anyone bother to stop such a person ? ) Caroline did possess other assets as well . She could cook . She had worked in her father 's restaurant her entire youth . She could walk into a kitchen with a nearly bare pantry and create chilis and pastas and stews . This made her eminently employable . Restaurants hired people off the books . No legitimate Social Security number required . No references . No one would suspect this bland , wan woman was anything but harmless and ordinary . Because , despite the circumstances that had brought her here , she knew herself finally to be harmless and ordinary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel nearly as fear-struck . She even had an hour or two of giddy confidence . She was almost ready . Almost . She imagined in future years there would be time to go over the series of events that led to the one event that inevitably led to the motel room . It felt like that , a whoosh of history , the somersault of dialectic rather than the firm step of will . The weight of centuries of history counterlevered against what , one person 's action ? Just in the planning they knew where it would lead . Contingencies are never really contingencies but blueprints . Probabilities became certainties . She knew she would comb over how she came to be involved with cells and plans and people who believed in the inevitable and absolute . Someday she would explain her intentions to someone , at least to herself . And the event , which she could not think about , not yet , the event that she could not even name , she referred to in her thoughts as then , or the thing , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , over and over again , especially the part where Mary became Freya became Caroline . What else ? She brushed her teeth . She ate more peanut butter and bread . She wished for a joint but settled for a beer bought at the store across the street . She exited briefly the afternoon of the third day , wearing large sunglasses and a scarf . She trembled in the fluorescence of the convenience store and hurried to pick up some juice , some beer , the paper . The Lincoln Journal Star . Front page , lower left quarter , a picture of Bobby Desoto . Just pay and leave . She stumbled back across the highway to her mustard-colored motel room . She read as she walked . She opened the paper to the inside report and felt the fear come crashing back , making her stumble . She started to cry noisy , hiccuped sobs and gulps as she closed the door behind her , staring at the lines of type . She learned that the group had been identified , although only one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakest . They must have gotten the names from her , just as Bobby suspected they probably would . ( Behind her back he used to refer to Tamsin as M.L.C . Most Likely to Crack . ) But Tamsin did n't really know the details of the various underground plans . The authorities were looking , but they had few leads . Nevertheless , contact anytime soon with Bobby was definitely out . She already knew that would probably be the case , but she cried anyway . She drank three beers in a row watching TV shows about regular people . She sniffed as her nose ran . She went over everything again and again . Had she already made mistakes ? Her motel room was outside the train station just south of Lincoln , Nebraska , which was practically the dead center of the country . She wondered she stared at Ironside and then turned the channel to Owen Marshall , and then to a commercial for denture glue if a lot of fugitives headed for the dead center of the country , stopping there to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugitive central , a magnet . PoliGrip . Eat like a man . Polaroid . Land Camera . SX-70 . Almost part of you . D-Con . House and garden spray . Against bugs . She wondered if her every thought would be predictable , the same things people always thought in these circumstances , and if she would give herself away without even realizing it . She doubted , actually , that anyone else would follow her Nebraska strategy . Logic would say try to get over the border , to Canada or Mexico . Most would move to the perimeter . That was what they would be looking for . What else ? She , Caroline , did n't have siblings , and her parents died in a car wreck years ago . She felt superstitious about writing that down . As if it would curse her poor parents somehow , or undo her younger sister . For the first couple of years , Caroline would n't be able to resist the occasional phone call to her mother . She knew this was dangerous . She knew this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , COINTELPRO , the police , all of them , expected this and had tapped the phones of all her relatives and friends . If there was anything Bobby had hammered into her , it was the consequences of involving other people . Anyone she told the truth to could be charged with harboring a fugitive . No contact of any kind could occur . She only hoped that somehow her family understood this . That she was protecting them . Caroline would talk herself out of it as many times as she could , and then she would call from a phone booth . She would wait until her father or mother picked up the phone . She would say nothing . She would listen to the sound of her mother 's voice saying hello , and then her mother getting annoyed and repeating that word , hello , in an urgent way . Then Caroline would hang up and start crying . Or continue crying , as that had already started when her finger first rotated the dial on the phone . She would go as long as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time , until a few months went by and she could n't resist calling once more . And ? Choose a California Social Security number , start with 568 or 546 . The next two digits relate to your age . Always even numbered . She removed the towel from her wet hair . She opened the tiny frosted window in the bathroom to let the hot , steamy air escape . She took the towel and wiped the mirror clear . In the seconds before it fogged again , she glimpsed her newly blond hair . It was a daffodil yellow blond , not the ash promised on the box . The side-parted , sophisticated and liberated woman on the L'Oral box . From the Champagne Blonde series . Honestly . But it did n't matter . She would n't feel liberated by her blond hair whether it was egg-yolk yellow or a pale , early-summer corn-silk flaxen . She did n't feel any relief in discarding her old look , or in no longer having to be the woman she was . She only felt an unnamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do you discover when you remove all the variables ? That you are the sum of your experiences and vital statistics ? That you are you no matter what your name or whether people expect different things of you ? She wanted to feel the joy of no one urging her to go to graduate school , or to get married , or even to give it all up for the movement . To get to be anyone is a rebirth , is n't it ? But she could n't be anyone , she got to be had to be anyone but who she was . In retreat and in hiding . She looked at herself , and she saw the same whispery , alone person she had been her whole life , more unlikely than ever to feel at home anywhere . And the dyed hair made her complexion more sallow . She looked not monochromatic but subchromatic . A pallid suggestion of a person . The very last time she would call home was on her mother 's birthday , March 9 , 1975 . Twenty-nine months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground . She called , and her mother answered the phone . She listened as her mother said Hello ? and waited , not hanging up , because she could n't , not just yet , and her mother said , " Mary , is that you ? Mary ? " with a plaintive , quiet voice . She instantly pushed the receiver button to disconnect , still pressing her ear to the handset . She could hear her breath , feel her heart dropping to her stomach , and her knees actually buckling at the sound of her mother saying her name . To her . She leaned against the phone booth and then felt a contraction and a heave as coffee-tinged bile rose up her throat and back down . She knew then she could n't call again , ever . Never , ever , never . She had written it all down , once , on the ripped-out piece of spiral notebook paper . Her name , her history , the members of her family . Where Caroline Sherman had spent every year of her twenty-two years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shreds over the wastebasket . Then she fished the shreds out of the basket and lit them one by one in the yellow glass ashtray . She had it all memorized . She had all the details already in her head if not exactly in her heart .
