Assault on Middle-Class Americans // The twentieth century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance : the growth of democracy , the growth of corporate power , and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy . - ALEX CAREY // The odds are that during the past recession , you or someone you know was affected by corporate layoffs and the loss of a job . It 's a painful experience , and one that can have a devastating effect on individuals and families . But in some cases , layoffs have affected entire towns , in effect crippling communities . And layoffs related to outsourcing have long-term effects on those communities , because companies pulling out take their taxes with them-that is , if they paid them at all . And the people in the town are also unable to pay taxes , because they 're no longer getting paid to work . // These corporate pullouts run the gamut from manufacturing to high tech . The examples in the next few pages are just a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities all across America . // In Syracuse , New York , Carrier , the maker of air-conditioning and heating units , is closing two of its most productive and profitable factories and laying off 1,200 workers . Most of those jobs are headed to Singapore and Malaysia . It 's too early for many of Carrier 's employees to retire-the average worker at the plant is only forty-nine years old . In a move to save the jobs , New York State and the plant 's union tried to dissuade Carrier from exporting the jobs to Asia by offering a $42 million incentive package . To no avail-the company is outsourcing these jobs . // With the closing of the Carrier plant , central New York State has now lost 10,000 jobs since 1990 . Senator Hillary Clinton told me that she believes " Manufacturing is not a luxury . It 's not an old-fashioned economic activity . It truly is core to much of what we need to do to maintain a strong economy and , I would argue , a strong national defense . " Senator Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee . A conservative Republican and a liberal Democrat in agreement on economic issues is a sign that the times , and Washington 's policies , could be changing . // Syracuse may be better off than some cities in that it has an anchor industry : higher education . It 's home to Syracuse University , and the city has worked hard to diversify its economy in the wake of plant closings by General Motors , General Electric , and Allied Signal . However , even with the anchor of Syracuse University , wage growth in the city has fallen below the national average as manufacturing jobs have left . // What 's happening in Syracuse is no different from what is happening in many communities across America . From steel to appliances to automobiles , paying manufacturing jobs are being exported out of the country , leaving behind workers and communities struggling with how to recover . // The automobile industry is a prime example of a business in which ruthless pressure to cut costs has driven jobs abroad . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee , 500 employees used to make the frames for Dodge Ram pickup trucks . Now that work , and their jobs , are going to Mexico . The decision was made by DaimlerChrysler , which is squeezing its American suppliers by asking them to match the lower prices available from overseas manufacturers . All the automakers , not just Chrysler , claim they need these lower prices in order to keep making affordable cars and to keep market share . // Early this year , Ford closed its plant in Edison , New Jersey , after more than fifty-five years of producing cars and trucks there . A Ford spokesman said it would be too expensive to retool that plant so that it could produce different models . About 300 of the plant 's 900 workers were relegated to early retirement , while others were transferred to Ford plants elsewhere in the country . Most important , at least 400 jobs were eliminated . Ford is , however , investing heavily in Asia and has set up a new regional headquarters in Thailand . // General Motors , long the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Chevy , the Equinox . The Equinox is assembled in Canada with a Chinese-made engine . Now , the three most expensive parts of any automobile are the body , engine , and transmission . With the Equinox featuring a foreign-built engine , more than a third of the vehicle 's cost is being transferred-and paid out-to China and not to American suppliers or workers . An interesting statistic : Employment in the U.S. auto industry has dropped by 200,000 jobs over the past four years . During that same time , imports of Chinese auto parts have doubled . // What makes all these examples so frustrating for American workers is that while Detroit throttles back at home and invests in Asia , foreign automakers , including Honda , Nissan , and Toyota , are investing in this market . In fact , as American automakers cut back , these Japanese companies are providing all the production growth in the United States . And calling our American automakers the Big Three is now a myth . Only two companies , Ford and GM , are American-based , while Chrysler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine point on it , Toyota is selling more cars in the United States than Chrysler . And Toyota is now the second leading global car company , after General Motors . // We 're not faring well in the auto business , and we 're not faring well in the appliance business . Galesburg , Illinois , is the birthplace of poet Carl Sandburg and for many years was home to a large Maytag factory . In fact , Galesburg was a Maytag company town , and Maytag provided 1,600 jobs to local workers . // But Maytag decided to close its Galesburg factory and move much of the work to a new refrigerator manufacturing plant in Reynosa , Mexico . None of the American jobs are slated to be transferred-all 1,600 are scheduled to be laid off . Employees who made $15 an hour are being replaced by Mexican workers who earn less than $1 an hour . Maytag justifies the closing by citing competition from cheaper Asian refrigerators , and the tighter wallets of cost-conscious consumers . // With a current jobless rate of 9 percent , Galesburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with a very uncertain future . People there ca n't turn to the government for help . After all , free trade agreements signed by the government promised workers at plants like this one a chance to export their products to new markets around the world . But the reality is , the only thing being exported from Galesburg is American jobs . // Clintwood , Virginia , has a population of 1,800 . It 's not a big town , but 250 of its best jobs are in the process of being outsourced to India . Online travel service Travelocity is shutting down its call center here . Workers at Travelocity made a starting wage of $8 an hour , plus training and benefits . But Travelocity lost $55 million last year and was looking to cut costs fast . It decided it could save $10 million by moving its Clintwood call center to India . Travelocity told CNN that " We made a difficult decision to outsource following significant losses last year . Our costs were significantly higher than our major competitors , who had chosen long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . " // Travelocity is trying to give workers a soft landing by providing eleven months ' notice , along with possible interviews at Travelocity 's two remaining U.S. call centers . Clintwood , meanwhile , is going back to its roots , marketing one of the few things that ca n't be outsourced : tourism . Combined with local crafts and a mountain music museum dedicated to a local artist , Grammy Award winner Ralph Stanley , the town is attracting attention to itself . As a final note , the whole Travelocity episode was the second of two body blows to Clintwood . Just before Travelocity set up shop there , Nexus Communications had shut down a similar call center operation in the town . // The people of Celina , Tennessee , have experienced firsthand the cost of free trade . Twelve hundred people once worked in the town 's OshKosh plant in Celina . Now only fifteen do . The rest of those jobs were sent out of the country , to Mexico and Honduras . Some of the company 's employees had worked at OshKosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment rate in Celina is 15.5 percent , and its per capita income has fallen to $13,000. // While Celina is just one more town abandoned by American companies in search of cheap foreign labor , the town is fighting to get back on its feet and stay there . Clay County has created a Web site to attract new business to Celina and the surrounding area , and the chamber of commerce is aggressively selling the county to outsiders . It has already been successful , having lured a commonly outsourced business to the town : a call center . Healthcare Management Resources has set up a new center to handle billing for hospitals and now employs 120 people . The jobs do n't pay as much as the factory jobs at OshKosh , but it 's steady work and it carries benefits . Moreover , the company is thrilled with Celina . According to Dennis Swartz , the president of Healthcare Management Resources , the people of Celina have a " great work ethic . I put these people up against anybody anywhere . And my goal in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth center , a fifth center in areas just like this . " // Internet provider Earthlink is closing its call center in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , and sending 400 jobs to the Philippines and India . The state of Pennsylvania has already been hard hit by job losses , having seen 132,000 manufacturing jobs evaporate . Now it 's seeing its high-tech jobs go away . At a stop in Harrisburg in 2004 , President Bush told Pennsylvanians that " There are people looking for work because jobs have gone overseas . And we need to act in this country . We need to act to make sure there are more jobs at home . " So far , that has been nothing but an empty statement . And to worsen the pain , the Earthlink workers in Harrisburg have been denied special trade assistance by the Bush administration . // Outside of the obvious factory closings and new call centers in India , there are the insidious under-the-radar cases of outsourcing that we rarely ever detect . They eat away at our economic infrastructure like rot in a foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , The Smithsonian Institution has chosen Innodata Isogen to create an online library of one of the most expansive research projects in American history , the United States Exploring Expedition . Running from 1838 to 1842 , it was the first federally funded mission of exploration in U.S. history and yielded nearly 3,000 pages of data on topics including geology , anthropology , American art , and more . But Innodata Isogen outsourced the work to the Philippines . According to the Smithsonian , the work was sent overseas because there are not enough skilled workers in this country to do the job . I find it incredibly hard to believe that it required offshore talent to chronicle the legacy of one of America 's greatest research endeavors. // Under-the-radar outsourcing affects small industries that have been the source of jobs in the United States for as long as most people can remember . The embroidery industry , one of the mainstays of the New Jersey economy for more than a century , is now in danger of disappearing from this country . Small New Jersey factories once made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bedding . It was a **26;35;TOOLONG industry with nearly 7,000 jobs . Today , there are less than 1,000 jobs left . American clothing manufacturers still require embroidery on their products , but they 've gone to Sri Lanka , India , China , and Mexico to get it done . // It 's doubtful that anyone will claim that embroidery is a critical component of our national economy , yet it is a traditional craft that has provided a good income to thousands of Americans for generations . And there 's still a lot of it being done-just not by Americans . It 's one more part of apparel manufacturing that is being outsourced . Today , 96 percent of clothing production is done outside our borders . That fact had a direct bearing on last year 's closing of thirty-seven textile factories in North and South Carolina alone . // And when it comes to apparel , even gaping loopholes in U.S. Customs inspections of clothing and textiles are costing American jobs . Less than one-tenth of one percent of the three million textile shipments that come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security gap that foreign textile manufacturers have been exploiting to their benefit and our detriment . Knowing that they are unlikely to get caught , unscrupulous producers will label a piece of clothing to read that it was made in , say , Honduras , when it may actually have come from China . Then it 's shipped to the United States using falsified entry documents . According to a recent General Accounting Office report , the lack of inspection at our borders results in the frequent smuggling of garments past U.S. customs . // There 's even more opportunity for abuse . U.S. Customs allows shippers to pass cargo through the United States , free of charge and free from quota restrictions , on its way to another country . But Customs does not track shipments adequately enough to ensure that they leave the United States . Many shipments get here , claim to be passing through , and are then diverted to store shelves in American cities and towns-without a penny in tariffs ever being paid . This kind of cheating makes it hard for American textile manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in tariff revenue from this kind of fraud and smuggling , but one case provides some stunning insight . In Long Beach , California , 5,000 containers were stopped and inspected . Customs agents found illegal merchandise . The exporter was trying to avoid paying $65 million in duties . // The final indignity is that these imports , both legal and illegal , are usually arriving on foreign-owned ships . Seven hundred fifty billion dollars ' worth of goods comes into the United States on ships each year , but not one of the top ten international shipping companies is American-owned . Foreign companies have bought out nearly all the top American cargo carriers-a trend that has been facilitated by foreign governments that subsidize their international shipping companies . American firms sold out when they realized they could n't compete against subsidized international shipping . Free trade or simply the absence of an American trade strategy ? // These foreign ships are arriving in American port terminals that are increasingly under the control of foreign companies . //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
