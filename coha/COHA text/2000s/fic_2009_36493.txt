People came to Kobuleti to hide . It 's why we were there , and it 's why Bakhar Lagidze had brought his family there , and I knew it , and I never asked him why . <br> I should have . <br> I was awake but unsure of it , my eyes suddenly open , the last whispers of dream vanishing , leaving me with no true memory , just the impression that it had been unpleasant , that I had done things of which I was not proud . Full-moon blue filtered into the bedroom , shadows swayed behind the thin curtains as long pine boughs rocked in the breeze . <br> Our dog , Miata , an old Doberman with no voice , was pacing at the door . I tried to focus my blurred vision on him as he turned a circle in place , raised a paw to scratch at the door , then glanced back my way . I fumbled my glasses off the nightstand and onto my nose , watched as he repeated the sequence . It had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sleep , and I knew the behavior for what it was , and it shifted me fully awake , and I put a hand on Alena 's shoulder . <br> " Trouble , " I said . <br> She murmured , refusing to surface . <br> " Wake up . " I 'd been speaking in Georgian . I switched to Russian . " Trouble . " <br> I looked to the door in time to see Miata finish another circuit , this time to fix me with a plea in his eyes . Any other dog , I 'd have thought he was fighting a weak bladder . I slipped out of bed , felt the hardwood immediately leech heat from my feet . There was a pistol in the nightstand drawer . I put the gun down long enough to pull on my jeans . <br> " What 's going on ? " Alena asked . <br> " Miata 's got something . " <br> She looked at me blearily , halfheartedly shook her head , as if unsure she was dreaming this or not . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stay here . " <br> She was readying a pistol of her own as I left the room . <br> The two laptops that ran our security system lived in the linen closet beside the bathroom , on the shelf above the towels . I could feel Miata 's moist breath against my bare ankles as I checked each . No alerts , nothing had been tripped . Nothing on the video . Nothing in the logs . It occurred to me that Miata was now an old dog , and maybe he really did need to take a leak , nothing more . <br> Then he bolted away down the hall , paws clacking on the floor . I followed more slowly and caught up with him at the back door . Together we listened to the night , and whatever it was he was hearing , I was n't . I opened the door , and stepped out after him into the summer darkness . <br> The air was close to cold , chilled as it came in off the Black Sea , with threads of thin fog hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the house as it had been within . I thought about going back for a shirt , but Miata had begun cautiously trotting toward the woods that ringed our house , muzzle and ears both raised , and he clearly was n't in a mood to wait . Two will-o ' - the- wisps , dim halos , blinked at me as a car came along the road that cut through the forest in the distance . The sound of the engine followed a second later , but barely , the vehicle easily half a mile away , turning along the road that led to the Lagidze home . The light , then the sound , faded . <br> I followed Miata to the edge of the treeline , where it bordered our backyard , put a hand on his back to calm him . Alena and I had cut down several of the trees in the past two years to clear sight lines to the perimeter , and we still had four cords of wood split and stacked and ready to keep us warm through the coming winter . <br> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to follow me . <br> Flat run , barefoot , in the forest , in the dark , it took me almost three minutes to cover the distance , and I counted gunshots as I ran . I heard a total of fourteen more , all of them sounding as if spoken by the same weapon . An engine turned as I reached the edge of the dirt road leading to Bakhar 's house , and the car it belonged to was already in gear and accelerating , and the lights hit me . The driver 's response to seeing me , shirtless , barefoot , and armed , was to floor the Land Cruiser and swerve it in my direction . <br> My answer was to get the hell out of the way as fast as I could , and when I got to my feet again , the car had already shot around the bend , taillights retreating . Miata burst out of the woods , racing in the direction of the house . I went after him . A second Land Cruiser was parked outside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could see three men heading for the larger vehicle . The night stole details , but I saw that two of them were armed , and one of them had a long gun , the distinctive silhouette of an AK , and maybe Miata did n't care , but I sure as hell did . <br> " Back ! " I shouted the command in Russian , and Miata took it immediately , veering off sharply , into the cover of the woods on the right . <br> I went left , and had just enough time to put a tree between myself and the AK before the shots came . Whoever was on the trigger knew his business and controlled his bursts , sending three my way in short order . The Land Cruiser started up right after the third salvo . I broke cover to run alongside the road , using the trees , and the AK shouted at me again , and this time I got a fix on the shooter and returned fire , two double-taps that went true . <br> A door slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then was gone . <br> I brought my pistol down , tried to get my heart rate and breathing to follow suit . Miata edged out of the shadows on the other side of the road , followed me as I went to check on the man I 'd shot . His legs had folded beneath him where he 'd collapsed , the AK lying parallel to his knees . I could see he was Caucasian , probably Eastern European , which was hardly a surprise , considering that was where we were . I found a wallet and a wad of euros on him and took both , stuffing them into my own pockets . I picked up the AK , gave it a quick check . <br> The night had gone quiet again . <br> I looked toward my friend 's house . The front door was ajar , perforated with shots . Moonlight dropped a shadow that filled the entrance with darkness . <br> " Bakhar ? " <br> I did n't get an answer . I did n't expect one . <br> I already knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> <br> The first thing Bakhar Lagidze had said to me was , " You run like someone is chasing you . " <br> Then he laughed . <br> This was n't the first time I 'd seen him , but it was the first time we 'd exchanged words . He , his wife , daughter , and young son had moved into the neighboring house the previous spring , and in the interest of exercising due diligence , Alena and I had taken status quo , by necessity , had to be viewed as a potential threat . Theoretically , we were as safe now as we were ever likely to be , living under carefully established cover that we had each come to embrace . But theory and practice continue to be two different things , and there were people who knew what we had done , and what we could do , and who , despite their promises to the contrary , might one day decide not to leave well enough alone . <br> So we had made it our business to know who these new neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no threat to us . <br> It would have been easy for me to have ignored him , then , to have pretended to be too absorbed in my run to have heard him . But we 'd passed one another on this road before , me running back up from Kobuleti 's one main street , heading home , him walking with his fishing pole and tackle box down to the beach . It was n't simply that it would 've been rude ; better to be known and accepted in the community , to belong , and thus turn the community itself into another layer of security . <br> So I slowed , then stopped , then turned back to face him , maybe twenty feet between us . He was watching me , head cocked to the side , the edges of a smile visible beneath his thick mustache . <br> " You 're always going so fast , " he said . " Every time I see you . Sprinting . " <br> " Tail end of the run , " I explained . " Last push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole to gesture up the road , at the woods . " You and your wife , you 're in the little house , right ? " <br> I crossed the road closer to where he stood , nodding . It was easier than using words , and I was somewhat breathless , and it gave me a few more seconds to think things through . Alena took her run in the afternoon , preferring to leave it before dinner , and it was as likely as not that he 'd seen her taking the same route I did . <br> He used the pole again , this time to gesture in the direction of his home . " We 're in the Party house , the old Russian 's place . Fucking Russians , we had to tear out half of everything just to make it into a home . " <br> " Yeah , we 're always working on our place , " I said . <br> He nodded , commiserating with a lifetime commitment to home improvement , then set down his pole so it leaned against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakhar Lagidze . " <br> " David , " I lied . " David Mercer . " <br> We shook hands . <br> " American ? " <br> " Canadian , " I lied , again . " You 're local ? " <br> " Born in Tbilisi . You speak our language very well . " <br> " My wife taught me . " <br> " She 's Georgian , too ? " <br> I nodded . The lies were so practiced they did n't require any thought on my part . " But she grew up in Moscow . She used to dance . " <br> Bakhar Lagidze 's eyes lit up . They were blue , deep set in his lined face . His mustache , mostly black , had strays of gray emerging . I put him in his early forties , maybe five years older than I was . <br> " She should meet Tiasa ! She 's my daughter , she wants to dance , like the Bolshoi . Your wife teaches , right ? " <br> " A little , " I admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , since we 'd last returned from the U.S. She 'd posted flyers in the cafes in town , initially as a means of reinforcing our cover , establishing a meager supplemental income that we did n't really need . It was my suspicion that she enjoyed teaching , though she had yet to admit as much to me . " You should bring her by . " <br> " Maybe Ia will bring her over . " <br> " Ia ? " <br> " My wife . " Bakhar 's smiled broadened , showing stained teeth and genuine pleasure . " Wonderful to meet you , David . Nice to meet the neighbors . " <br> " Good to meet you , too , " I told him . <br> It was n't until I was home , under the needle-spray of the shower , that it occurred to me that Bakhar Lagidze had most likely done to us what we had done to him . He 'd checked us out , just enough to be sure his neighbors did n't pose him a threat . <br> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another source entirely . <br> I stepped in blood when I stepped into the house . There was a lot of it , and I could smell it , along with the lingering of gunpowder . The moonlight outside was n't enough . I was going to have to turn on a light . <br> When it came on , I could see the puddle , spent brass glittering in and around it . The blood broke into a smear , leading down the hall . Like our home , Bakhar 's was only one-story . Unlike ours , it was large , as befitted a family of four . On entry , the hall opened to a common room that doubled for dining , and then , off that , was the kitchen . Following the hall led to the master bedroom , and then the corridor went ninety degrees to the left , to the bathroom and the two other bedrooms . <br> Miata snuffed at the air behind me , hesitating . <br> " Home , " I told him , and pointed the way . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> The smear ran straight to the master bedroom , its door wide open . I tried to be careful where I stepped as I followed the trail down the hall . My blood-covered soles dried on the carpet , and for a second I thought they might be a problem later , but then I thought about the general state of law enforcement in Georgia in general , and Kobuleti in particular , and admitted that I was most likely worrying about nothing . Forensic science had n't ever been high on the national agenda , and since the war in South Ossetia and the subsequent Russian stranglehold on the country , it had fallen even further . <br> A table lamp had fallen in the bedroom , its light still on , and it illuminated from below . Somehow it made the scene inside the more horrible . <br> The blood had been Bakhar 's , but I 'd already guessed that , and maybe that was why I thought I 'd find less of it in here . I was wrong . There was more . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot in the hall , through the front door , perhaps as he 'd come to answer it . I had n't seen a gun anywhere on the floor and I was n't seeing one in the bedroom , so if he 'd been expecting trouble and had come to answer it with some of his own , the men who 'd killed him had taken the weapon . They 'd hit Bakhar in the chest , perhaps as many as four times from what I could see . Then they 'd entered and taken hold of him , likely by his hair , and dragged him to the master bedroom , where they 'd propped him on his bed . <br> At that point they 'd gone to work on him with a knife . <br> He was still recognizable to me , but barely . Stabs and slashes covered his face , chest , and groin , though I could n't see any on his arms or hands , nothing that resembled a defensive wound . It would have been nice to believe that meant he 'd already died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tried to defend himself because there 'd been nothing left of him to defend . But it was just as likely that he 'd been dying instead of dead , and from the two Land Cruisers I knew there had been at least four of them who had come for the killing , and certainly two could 've held his arms while a third set to carving . <br> The knife had been entirely unnecessary , and the savagery of it spoke clearly of cruelty and rage . His neck had been cut so badly it seemed now barely able to keep his head with his body . Blood , brain , and flecks of bone glistened in the macabre light . I could see the pearl gray of his cervical vertebrae in the mass of red meat that had been his throat . <br> This was n't simply murder . <br> This was looking at hatred , pure and plain . <br> Continues ...
