<p> CORPORATE capitalism is in grave danger , and the threat does not come from without : state-run communism is all but extinct , with the notable exceptions of North Korea , Cuba and China-in-transition . Instead , it is the corporation itself  --  the institution that rose up to dominate the world economy in the 20th century  --  that threatens to cause its own demise in the 21st . <p> That is the warning issued by Alan Murray in " Revolt in the Boardroom : The New Rules of Power in Corporate America " ( HarperCollins , $25.95 ) . Mr. Murray , an assistant managing editor and columnist at The Wall Street Journal , says public corporations are " in the midst of radical change , " prompted by a revolt against the once-unchallenged dominance of chief executives . <p> " The media still portrays the chief executive as the center of the corporate universe , " Mr. Murray writes . " In fact , the C.E.O . has been greatly diminished and now shares power with an array of others  --  boards of directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountants , lawyers , nongovernmental organizations  --  all of whom are eager to have their say in the corporation 's affairs . " <p> He makes note of a " remarkable string " of C.E.O . departures since 2004 . The fallen mighty include Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard , Maurice R. Greenberg of the American International Group , Jeffrey W. Greenberg of Marsh &; McLennan , Harry C. Stonecipher of Boeing , Raymond V. Gilmartin of Merck and Hank McKinnell of Pfizer . <p> The reasons differed  --  from an affair with an executive in Mr. Stonecipher 's case to the Vioxx fiasco in Mr. Gilmartin 's  --  but in each the departure was a sign that the board was no longer willing to turn a blind eye to a chief 's failings , whether fiscal , managerial or personal . Mr. Murray cites statistics showing that the above half-dozen C.E.O . ' s are part of a pervasive trend . <p> A study by Burson-Marsteller found that C.E.O . turnover in 2005 was up 126 percent from 2000 . A survey by Booz Allen Hamilton found that 35 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 were forced out , versus 12 percent in 1995 . <p> Mr. Murray says the revolt against chief executives was prompted by the bursting of the high-tech stock market bubble , the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the accounting scandals at Enron , WorldCom and Tyco . <p> During that time , Mr. Murray was host of " Capital Report , " a nightly television program on CNBC , " and the e-mail from viewers each night overflowed with contempt for their onetime business heroes , " Mr. Murray recalls . <p> " They felt betrayed , " he added , " both by the disappearance of their own stock market wealth , and the almost-daily reports of perfidy by executives . " <p> As investors became outraged , corporate directors revolted , and they were prompted by personal considerations  --  specifically , the realization that they could be held personally liable for misdeeds of C.E.O . ' s . " Directors were being forced to wake up , " Mr. Murray says , " and to recognize that board membership was n't just a cushy honor  --  it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this seemingly sudden corporate crisis had deep historical roots . In 1932 , in a landmark book called " The Modern Corporation and Private Property , " Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means described how corporations had ceded control of their vast pools of wealth to hired managers whose interests often diverged from those of the shareholders , who theoretically own the corporations . <p> This separation of ownership and control was reinforced in favor of the hired managers at a vast majority of corporations as the chief executive assumed the title of chairman . " While the C.E.O . technically reported to the board , the board , in the case of most American companies , was chaired by the chief executive  --  creating an odd , circular structure of accountability , " Mr. Murray observes . <p> He says that successful executives in the 21st century act less like autocrats and more like populist politicians answering to diverse constituencies . In that context , he offers thumbnail profiles of a " new power elite " that includes a union executive like Richard Ferlauto of the American Federation of State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who represents her religious order at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility , and the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman , who brought about a change in McDonald 's management strategy . <p> " Revolt in the Boardroom " raises  --  but fails to answer  --  a burning question : whether the revolt against the C.E.O.-centric corporation will become a true revolution . According to Mr. Murray , " the evidence is mixed . " <p> He says that outrage over excessive pay to C.E.O . ' s , particularly those who fail , is surging among the middle class . " Median wages have stagnated over the last two decades , even as wealth at the top has accumulated , testing Americans ' traditional tolerance for an unequal distribution of riches , " he says , adding , " The attack on C.E.O . ' s could be the leading edge of a much bigger and broader middle-class revolt that is only now rearing its head . " <p> One recent response to the furor has been a flight to private equity , to avoid the reporting requirements demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a long-term solution : after all , to whom can private equity firms ultimately sell their assets if not to public companies ? <p> Then there is the view that the boards of public companies can be unwieldy and ineffective . Mr. Murray quotes Mr. Greenberg 's assertion that " boards ca n't run companies . " <p> Mr. Murray 's recounting of Hewlett-Packard 's experience after the overthrow of Ms. Fiorina supports the Greenberg view . Upon becoming non-executive chairwoman of the board , Patricia C. Dunn sparked yet another crisis by authorizing an investigation that led to spying on directors . <p> Mr. Murray notes that after Ms. Dunn resigned , Mark V. Hurd , the chief executive , was given the additional title of chairman , " ending H.P. 's experiment with a new governance structure . " <p> WHAT will ultimately happen to the modern corporation ? " Optimists see a more responsive , more democratic , more socially responsible institution emerging from the upheaval , " Mr. Murray writes . " Pessimists fear that the very same ills that plague modern-day politics  --  polarization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> In the end , though he presents a wide-ranging view of the issues , we are left with a cliched observation that " much is at stake . " <p> Although he is a professional commentator , he is maddeningly reluctant to offer his opinion on what changes corporations ought to make in order to endure as viable institutions . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
