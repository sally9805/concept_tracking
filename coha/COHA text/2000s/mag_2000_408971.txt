If your doctor examined you by placing his ear against your chest , you would probably think this method was n't very scientific . But that is exactly how doctors listened to the sounds of the heart before the invention of the stethoscope . Doctors knew that the thumps and thuds inside the body could tell them a great deal.They looked for ways to hear these sounds better . In 1876 , a French doctor , Rene Laennec , was watching some children play . He saw that one child had her ear pressed against a long piece of wood . Someone would make a pinging sound with a pin at one end of the wood . At the opposite end , the child could hear the pin very clearly . The next day in the hospital , Dr. Laennec was having trouble examining an overweight patient . He had an idea . He rolled a piece of paper and tied it with string , making a tube . Placing one end on the patient 's chest , Rene could hear the sounds of the heart and lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever heard them before . // Rene Laennec was a skilled wood-worker , and he soon began making a similar device out of wood . The cylinder came in two interlocking parts that could be separated for easier carrying . It was called a stethoscope because stethos is the Greek word for chest . Although not everyone agreed with his theories , Dr. Laennec was an expert in his field . He wrote a book on the diseases of the chest and heart.With each copy sold came a free stethoscope , which he machine-turned out of cedar or ebony wood . Throughout the years , several improvements were made . In 1828 , a separate ear piece and chest piece made the stethoscope more practical . Also , the instrument became less rigid . Dr. Austin Flint of New York made a stethoscope with a hearing piece for each ear . Today 's stethoscope consists of two basic pieces : the body-contact piece and the ear pieces.There are also many types of stethoscopes , which are identified by the type of body-contact each piece has . The next time your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is using , a diaphragm stethoscope or a bell stethoscope.The diaphragm stethoscope has a flat disk with rubber stretched over the bottom . This type is used to listen to higher-pitched sounds . // The bell stethoscope looks more like a bell and is used to listen to low-pitched sounds.Your doctor might have a combination stethoscope that has both types of pieces . It is a simple matter to flip either the bell or the diaphragm into position . Medicine has come a long way since the first rolled-up paper tube . Some people think that our modern X-rays and electronic devices will replace the stethoscope . But more than ever , the stethoscope is a useful tool in discovering heart and lung disease . // <p>
