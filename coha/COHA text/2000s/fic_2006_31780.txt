Dark Water By Sharon Sala Harlequin Enterprises Limited Chapter One If Avery Wheeler had n't robbed an armored truck in Farmington , Maine , and taken a woman hostage , the state police would never have given chase when he headed north up Highway 27 . He made it all the way to the outskirts of Stanton before taking a side road toward Flagstaff Lake . The police were only a minute or so behind him , and even though it was almost dark , he knew he was n't going to make it to the Canadian border before they caught up with him . His plan , for the moment , was to get lost in the woods around the lake and hope for the best . At that point he was wishing he had n't dropped out of high school back in the seventies and had taken that job in his uncle 's meat-packing business . Even more , he wished to hell he 'd never laid eyes on the woman in the seat beside him . She had n't stopped screaming since he 'd shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted was to start this day over . But since that was n't possible , he opted for making a new start , and to do that , he had to get rid of the police and that damned screaming clerk . As he rounded a curve in the road , he saw the opportunity to do both . With the setting sun coming in through the driver 's side of the windows and the dark water of Flagstaff Lake before him , he unbuckled his seat belt , lowered the window , then stomped on the gas . The force of the acceleration slammed both him and his hostage against the back of the seat . Gritting his teeth , he braced himself against the steering wheel while the decibels of her shrieks rose . Out of patience and time , he backhanded the woman into a state of semiconsciousness as the car went airborne . The silence that followed was surreal . Even the sirens from the police cars seemed to fade . For Avery , everything began passing in slow motion . The slight whistle of the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . The last rays of the dying sun glittered on the dark , mirrored water like broken glass on spilled coffee . The soft moan coming from the woman 's lips mingled with his own panicked breaths as the water grew nearer and nearer . Then they hit . The impact was sharp and jarring , and Avery wondered how something so fluid could be so hard . The displaced water sent a ten-foot spray into the air , and then the car began sinking , faster than he would have imagined . When the water began spilling in through the open window , his heartbeat accelerated , even though this was exactly what he 'd planned . He reached into the seat behind him and grabbed the bag with the stolen money . As he did , the woman he 'd taken hostage began to come around . A thin trickle of blood was coming out of her nose from where he 'd hit her , and when she reached toward her face , it smeared across her cheek . She opened her eyes in blank confusion , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water on her clothes as if it was dust . When it would n't come off , she looked up at him with a wide , frantic stare . " Can you swim ? " he asked . She shook her head no . " Sorry , " he muttered , and pushed the front seat all the way back to give himself more room in which to maneuver out the window . She was going to drown . There was nothing he could do about that . " Do n't leave me ! " she screamed , and grabbed at his arm . He hit her with his fist . Her head snapped backward from the blow as she slumped down into the seat . " You 'll thank me later , " he muttered . At least her death would be painless . As he started out the window , the car began to flip . Panicked , he slung the shoulder strap of the bag over his head and began climbing out the window , desperate not to get caught in the sucking undertow . Twice the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side-view mirror on the outside of the door . Both times he thought about just letting go and saving himself , but he 'd gotten into this mess because of the money . He was n't yet ready to give it up . Suddenly he was free , and the elation of the moment gave him renewed hope . He felt along the underside of the frame until he came to a wheel , climbed up on it and pushed himself off , praying that he was swimming up and not down . The water felt thick , as if he was swimming in gelatin . He knew it was from the weight of the bag , but he was strong and a damned good swimmer . Moments later he surfaced , only to realize the sun had gone down . Treading water , he dared a glance at the shore . Although he could hear shouts from the police who had finally arrived , all he could see were the red-and-blue flashing lights and the vague silhouettes of the men as they ran back and forth in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him any better than he could see them , but the knowledge that they might made him swim even harder . He swam and he swam , until his arms felt like lead and his lungs were about to burst . Once again treading water , he stopped and looked behind him . The shore he 'd come from was alive with flashing lights and the faint sounds of men 's voices , shouting to one another . With a satisfied grin , he tugged the heavy wet bag to a more comfortable position and began to swim again . The opposite shore was nothing but a vague blur above the surface of the black water , but he could see one small light - probably someone 's porch light - through the trees . He fixed his eyes on that light and began to stroke . ( Continues ... )
