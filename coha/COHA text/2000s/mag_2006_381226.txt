The streets are wet with the dew of the coming monsoon as Rajeev Samant unveils his latest enterprise in midtown Bombay . The Tasting Room is a softly lit tapas bar built into a high-end furniture store in the old textile district . The idea is to showcase Samant 's range of Indian wines in a space that oozes class and cash  --  with bottles costing twice the average Indian weekly wage , it 's meant to be exclusive . Tonight the guests include local investment bankers , venture capitalists and a group of students from the business school in Fontainebleau , France , on a two-week trip to India to see what all the buzz is about . Over Chenin Blanc and Reserve Shiraz , the patrons swap investment tips and gossip about recent sightings of Richard Gere and Will Smith . " You 're so lucky to be here now , " says Samant , 39 . " This is an incredible time . It 's all happening . Right here , right now . " <P> <P> He 's right . If you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dizzying promise and turbocharged ambition , then head to its biggest , messiest , sexiest city  --  Bombay . Home to 18.4 million people and counting , the city , formally known as Mumbai , is projected by 2015 to be the planet 's second most populous metropolis , after Tokyo . But it 's already a world of its own . Walk down its teeming streets , and you 'll encounter crime lords and Bollywood stars , sprawling slums and Manhattan-priced condos , and jam-packed bars where DJs play the music of the Punjab , bhangra  --  a pulsating sound track familiar to clubgoers in London and New York City . Bombay is where Wall Street gets equities analyzed , where Kellogg , Brown &; Root sources kitchen staff for the U.S. Army in Iraq , and where your credit-card details may be stored  --  or stolen . It 's where a phone operator who calls herself Mary ( but is really Meenakshi ) sells Texans on two-week vacations that include the Taj Mahal and cut-rate heart surgery . Chances are those medical tourists will touch down in Bombay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivering thousands of new visitors every day  --  an increasing number of whom are staying for good . The reason is simple : to know Bombay is to know modern India . It 's the channel for a billion ambitions and an emblem of globalization you can reach out and touch , a giant city where change is pouring in and rippling out around the world . <P> But if India 's biggest city is its great hope , Bombay also embodies many of the country 's staggering problems . The obstacles hampering India 's progress  --  poor infrastructure , weak government , searing inequality , corruption and crime  --  converge in Bombay . Although India boasts more billionaires than China , 81% of its population lives on $2 a day or less , compared with 47% of Chinese , according to the 2005 U.N . Population Reference Bureau Report . That class divide is starkest in cities like Bombay , where million-dollar apartments overlook million-population slums . For all its glitz , Bombay remains a temple to inefficiency . In 2003 it had one bus for every 1,300 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 public toilets for every million people and one civic hospital for 7.2 million people in the northern slums , according to a report for the state government by McKinsey &; Co . At least one-third of the population lacks clean drinking water , and 2 million do not have access to a toilet .
