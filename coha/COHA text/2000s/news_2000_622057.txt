<p> One small step for a gecko is proving to be one giant leap for robot designers  --  and Spiderman may not be far behind . <p> Geckos are a superhero 's envy when it comes to their ability to climb rapidly up just about any vertical surface . Unlike other climbing animals and insects , the small lizards have no need for suction cups , Velcro-like hooks , electrostatic attraction or sticky secretions . <p> A gecko can dash up a smoothly polished glass surface as easily as we can fall off a log , sticking and unsticking its feet 15 times a second . It can hang from a ceiling , if it feels like it , by a single toe . Even in a laboratory-created vacuum , where suction would do little good , a gecko 's foot will still stick . <p> Despite a century of anatomical studies , nobody could ever figure out just how the lizard does it . <p> Now , researchers at the University of California at Berkeley , Stanford University and Lewis &; Clark College in Portland , Ore. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close look at the stylish Tokay gecko 's remarkable feet and toes . <p> A report on the research appeared earlier this month in the journal Nature . Animated pictures and graphics can be found on the Internet at http : //www.lclark.edu/ **25;1991;TOOLONG <p> Whimsical-Looking Appendages <p> Each five-toed foot of the Tokay is tipped with about 500,000 microscopic foot-hairs , whimsical-looking little appendages scientists call " setae " ( pronounced see-tee ) . Each seta is no more than about 5 microns in diameter  --  just 5 millionths of a meter , or about one-tenth the diameter of a human hair . <p> Even more astounding , the hairs blossom at the ends into hundreds of teeny split ends . The submicroscopic , funnel-shaped pads , or spatulae , measure a scant 200 nanometers across  --  200 billionths of a meter , so small they can not even be seen with visible light . <p> A climbing Tokay moves in such a way that when it presses a foot down , the toe hairs splay out and the spatulae unfurl , shooting out and recoiling like blow-through party toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatulae to get extraordinarily close to the target surface  --  so close that subtle intermolecular attractions kick in . Essentially , the lizards may be grabbing onto walls with the same atomic-scale " glue , " known as van der Waals forces , that make enzymes biochemically ' sticky . " <p> The reptilian toe-hairs are much smaller than ant feet . And yet a single seta , when pressed against a surface at the right angle , packs enough adhesive punch to hold up a typical ant 's full 20 milligrams of body weight . Changing the angle allows the seta to pop right off again . <p> A million of these suckers could fit onto a dime-sized patch capable of holding up 45 pounds . In theory , a teacher could use one of these patches to stick an unruly kindergartner to the classroom ceiling . <p> Conquering El Capitan <p> The new calculations might inspire some fantastic possibilities in climbing gear . Stores might someday stock gecko-style climbing gloves , for starters , with hundreds of little setae woven into the fingertips to help vertically challenged hominids conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to manufacture , but it 's not all that far off , " said UC Berkeley 's Robert Full , one of the lead authors of the Nature report . <p> Collaborators included Lewis &; Clark biologist Kellar Autumn , a former post-doctoral researcher in Full 's laboratory , which specializes in studying how animals move about . <p> Engineers Ronald Fearing at Berkeley and Thomas Kenny at Stanford helped the researchers achieve the first direct measurements of a single gecko foot-hair , the key step in unlocking the animal 's adhesive secrets , by constructing a delicate icro-electromechanical force sensor . <p> Many other gecko species sport similar footgear , but the Tokay is considered to have the most elaborate feet of any lizard known , possibly the most advanced dry-adhesive technology in nature outside the insect world . <p> Ants and cockroaches are well-equipped , too . Their feet sport tiny spines or hooks , supplemented by sticky secretions in some species , that work extremely well on nearly any rough or porous surface , even if the surface appears perfectly smooth to the naked eye . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those found in lizards , and their relatively low body weights give them a leg up on the heavier geckos . The Tokays could rely on their claws and muscles to grab on , as do birds and most big climbing animals , but that only would take them so far . Because of their unique foot apparatus , the geckos can generate adhesive forces 600 times greater than mere friction alone . <p> Such stick-on overkill appears to be nature 's strategy for overcoming the fact that a gecko has to contend with all kinds of rough , irregular surfaces in its native Southeast Asia habitat . In fact , with each step it takes , a Tokay grabs on with only about 2 percent of its available toe-hairs . <p> Mecho-Gecko ' <p> Proper attachment and detachment happen only when the feet hairs are angled and pressed correctly . And the findings , researchers say , reveal a new strategy for making robots with gecko-like feet capable of scampering up and down walls , say in a burning building to help locate trapped victims . <p> Smaller devices could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture . A prototype robot , called the " mecho-gecko , " is already in the works at a Massachusetts company called IS Robotics . <p> The fact that gecko adhesion works in a vacuum means the system could be used to design setae-studded tape suitable for use in space . " Geckos can do things that we just ca n't do with current robotics and adhesive technology , " Autumn said . <p> Some key details are still being kicked around by the researchers . It 's not quite clear , for example , just what kinds of molecular interactions might be going on to explain the lizard 's climbing prowess . Besides van der Waals forces , another factor that might be significant has to do with the water content of the setae and attractive forces between the water molecules and the surface . <p> Another puzzle is how the setae  --  made of the same keratinous material as human toenails  --  manage to stay clean , even when the lizards walk up dirty surfaces . <p> " You stick a piece of tape to a dirty surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autumn noted . " As the geckos walk , their feet get cleaner , not dirtier , and we do n't know exactly how they do that . " <p> HOW THE GECKO STICKS TO A WALL <p> Researchers have discovered that a Tokay gecko can climb a vertical wall , stick upside down or even cling to polished glass without benefit of suction , sticky secretions , electrostatic forces , friction or Velco-like interlocking . Instead , the lizard uses an elaborate array of toe-hairs and a peeling motion to form intermolecular bonds with the surface as it walks . <p> . <p> GECKO FOOT STRUCTURE <p> The gecko 's foot has vast numbers of setae fibrous structures of keratin , the material of fingernails about 500,000 per foot . <p> These setae are lined up in rows on the gecko 's toes . Each seta is about a tenth the diameter of a human hair . <p> A single seta , depicted at left , ends in what appears to be an array of split ends ; these are clumps of 400 to 1,000 tiny structures called spatulae . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are around 10 millionths of an inch across , and when spread out , begin to interact with a surface at a molecular level . <p> . <p> HOW THE GECKO MOVES AND ADHERES ( AN APPROXIMATION ) <p> The gecko moves with a peculiar motion of curling and uncurling its toes , up to 15 times a second . <p> When the spatulae reach the proper angle and pressure against the surface , they get so close that they generate the same binding force that holds molecules together . <p> The gecko tries to find the proper angle and pressure by moving its toes . The adhesive force of one spatula may not amount to much , but collectively they generate an impressive force . <p> As the gecko begins curling its feet again , an angle of around 30 starts to break the molecular force and the bond is released , leaving no residue . <p> . <p> Source : Kellar Autumn , Lewis &; Clark College and Robert J.
