<p> Florida State had just made a potentially game-changing play in its Sept. 5 opener against Miami , and there was confusion among the Seminoles ' coaches . <p> During the third quarter , Florida State had blocked a punt and recovered at the Miami 1 . The Seminoles ran fullback James Coleman up the middle twice and lost one yard each time . Facing third and goal from the 3 , and needing a touchdown to go ahead 17-7 , Coach Bobby Bowden wanted to run up the middle one more time . <p> " Let 's run the belly , " Bowden told his coaches in the press box . <p> " No , Coach . Let 's run the toss . We 've got a better chance going outside , " an assistant told him through the headset . <p> Like each of the games during the past 30 seasons at Florida State , Bowden made the final decision . So tailback Leon Washington took a handoff from quarterback Drew Weatherford and ran off guard and was stopped for a one-yard loss . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were forced to try a 26-yard field goal and missed . <p> " Dadgumit ! " Bowden yelled with his classic Southern drawl . <p> Bowden was upset the play did n't work , but was even more displeased that he had n't listened to his coaches . The Seminoles held on to win , 10-7 , and Bowden has n't overruled his coaches again this season . <p> " I suppose I 'm like most coaches now , standing on the sideline hoping somebody asks them a question , " Bowden said . <p> Bowden , who turns 76 on Nov. 8 , is actually doing more than that , but he has delegated responsibilities to his assistants more than ever before . <p> So far this season , the system is working for the Seminoles , who will go for their first 6-0 start since their 1999 national championship season when they play Virginia at Scott Stadium on Saturday night . <p> Florida State , which was n't expected to do much this season because of its freshman quarterback and depleted secondary and offensive line , is ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was No. 3 after nine games in 2003 . <p> " We have n't been there in a while , " Bowden said this week of the top-five ranking , as he sat behind his desk , chomping an unlit cigar . " I 'm surprised we 've gone as far as we 've gone . " <p> Many college football observers thought Bowden might be gone by now , especially after Florida State lost 15 games during the past four seasons , as many it had lost in the previous 11 seasons combined . <p> Bowden , Division I-A 's winningest coach with 356 victories , was n't ready to call it quits , though , and certainly did n't want to turn over a struggling program . But instead of trying to fix the problems himself , he decided to let his assistants do more . <p> Instead of retirement , Bowden chose to be more of a chief executive officer , coaching his coaches while they coached the players . <p> " There will be a day when I do n't want to walk out on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on if I 'm healthy and if we 're winning . " <p> Bowden said he still watches film of opponents , but " only in case something happens to one of the coordinators and I have to call the plays . " He watches his team practice from a tower and rarely gets involved in the hands-on coaching of players anymore . <p> But Florida State 's players still hear from their head coach frequently . Whenever Bowden sees Weatherford , the coach always tells his quarterback to throw the football " a foot in front of the numbers "  --  a reminder to put air under his passes so his receivers can run under them . <p> Bowden tells center David Castillo that the " low man always wins , " a cue for the lineman to keep his pad level low for better leverage . Linebacker Ernie Sims said Bowden tells him , " I want to see some knock-backs . " <p> " He loves knock-backs , " Sims said . " He loves us to step on toes and make big hits . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Relinquishing some of his responsibilities was tough for Bowden , who waited more than 20 years to hand off the offensive play calling to one of his assistants . First , he gave those duties to offensive coordinator Brad Scott and then to Mark Richt when Scott left to become coach at South Carolina . <p> " Once he gave up the play calling , he stayed in the game planning , " said Richt , now head coach at the University of Georgia . " But as time went on , he became less involved , but would still offer suggestions . But he 's still the boss , there 's no doubt about it . I do n't think anybody can question that . " <p> Bowden seems to be easing his way into retirement , but with the Seminoles winning again , he does n't know if it will happen anytime soon . <p> " Winning makes you a lot happier , " Bowden said . " It 's no fun to lose , no matter how old you are . " <p> Bowden has always resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the same house they bought in Tallahassee when he took the Florida State job in 1976 , although they made multiple additions to it after their family grew to include four sons and two daughters . <p> Three of Bowden 's sons became coaches  --  Jeff is the Seminoles ' offensive coordinator ; Tommy is the head coach at Clemson ; and Terry coached at Division I-AA Samford and Auburn . <p> " I nearly feel like if I retired , I 'd have to get another job , " Bowden said . " I do n't like sitting around , and I do n't know what else I would do . " <p> But Bowden knows he ca n't coach forever , and he already is lobbying for a hand-picked successor : Seminoles defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews , who has worked under Bowden since 1984 . Bowden said his support for Andrews is more than a reward for being loyal ( Andrews has lobbied for only one head coaching job , at Alabama , his alma mater ) during his tenure at Florida State . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years , " Bowden said . " You get all the publicity with the offense , but his defenses are why we 've been so good . He 's been here the longest , and I always felt like he deserved it . " <p> At one point , each of Bowden 's three sons seemed like a possible successor . Terry Bowden led Auburn to an undefeated season in his first season there , but his tenure ended suddenly and he has n't coached since , working as a college football television analyst instead . <p> Tommy Bowden produced record-setting offenses at Tulane and was a hot coaching commodity , but his teams have found only lukewarm success at Clemson . Jeff Bowden , his youngest son , has worked the past 13 seasons at Florida State . But while working as the Seminoles ' offensive coordinator in each of the past five seasons , he received a lot of the blame for the teams ' failures . When raises were doled out to the coaching staff after last season , none of the offensive aides received one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them following me , " Bobby Bowden said of his sons . " When a coach is at a school for a long time and he has had success , you do n't want to be the next guy . The next guy usually is n't there for very long . " <p> For now , though , Bowden is n't going anywhere and said he might still be sitting behind his desk overlooking Doak Campbell Stadium five years from now . He does n't seem ready to retire anytime soon , not with the Seminoles competing for the national championship and not with Penn State Coach Joe Paterno on his heels . <p> Bowden surpassed Paterno as the winningest coach in Division I-A history nearly two years ago . But with the Nittany Lions undefeated at 6-0 and ranked in the top 10 again , Paterno is only seven victories behind Bowden . <p> " Dad is really happy , " Terry Bowden said . " He 's having a lot of fun this year . Joe Paterno is three years older than dad , so surely my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @
