<p> Once characterized by angst and risky behavior , midlife now is believed by some experts to be the happiest time of adult life . <p> " From age 30 to 50 , life only gets better and better , " said Ron Kessler , professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School . " These are the best years of their lives . " <p> While hip twentysomethings and aging baby boomers might disagree , a growing body of research shows depression to be highest at the beginning and end of adult life . The reasons are straightforward : Young adults are consumed with life 's big decisions  --  starting a career , getting married , having children . Older seniors , particularly those over 75 , are plagued by failing health and worries about nearing the end of their lives . <p> People at midlife  --  technically 38 to 55 years old  --  are usually more settled , typically married , and in many cases , their children are grown or nearly grown . They have more free time and more money . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes made in a " midlife crisis " can launch the happiness missing in earlier years . <p> Drastic change gave Julie Cordes of Antioch the midlife energy boost she needed . Cordes was a 40-year-old married mother of two working as a federal court clerk when she joined the Army Reserve last fall . Her husband , a Round Lake Beach police officer , thought Cordes was having a midlife crisis . But Cordes insists she simply needed more in her life . <p> As the oldest in her three-month-long boot camp at Fort Jackson , S.C. , Cordes was determined that her age was n't going to affect her success as a soldier . <p> " I had to do everything that my 19-year-old counterparts did , and I did it better than most , which is what shocked the drill sergeant , " said Cordes , who finished second in her platoon . <p> " You learn a phrase in basic training : ' Suck it up and drive on , ' " she said . <p> Cordes ' military-intelligence unit based out of Fort Sheridan is scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war is a risk she is prepared to take . <p> Deborah Carr , an associate professor of sociology at Rutgers University , says life in the middle years is n't easy , but people are more equipped to handle challenges than at any other time of their lives . <p> " People in their 40s and 50s are at their best ; they have established themselves , " Carr said . " They do n't have the sturm und drang of their 20s . They do n't have young children who are exhausting them . But they are still young enough that they are healthy , and they have money . " <p> ' SQUIRMING AND DISCONTENTED ' <p> For Mike Lavorato , 41 , midlife has meant having the financial freedom to break away from his corporate job and start his own companies . <p> Lavorato credits his upbringing and his Catholic faith for his positive outlook . <p> " If I lived my life thinking that at 41 I 'm halfway to room temperature , that would be depressing , " said Lavorato , who sings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and volunteers with the Red Cross . <p> " I think I 've addressed the big questions in life . It all comes back to faith and why am I here and what am I supposed to be doing ? " <p> But not everyone agrees that the passage to midlife is so smooth . For the people who seek counsel from Dr. Dan Haycraft , a Skokie psychiatrist , middle age is a time of transition and questioning . <p> " It 's a place where we 're really squirming and discontented and very uncomfortable , " said the 50-year-old Haycraft , who specializes in counseling men in transition . " By our 40s , we have the first sense that our clock on life is really ticking . By our 50s , our bodies start changing , and we are really confronted , maybe for the first time , with our mortality . " <p> One of the biggest challenges of middle age is not to act irrationally , quit a job , have an affair and get a divorce , said Haycraft , who also counsels married couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos , create change and make people feel alive , but they are also incredibly destructive , he said . <p> " The common thread we have found , " said Meg Haycraft , " is that no one gets through midlife without dealing with the questioning of : What 's next ? What 's not complete ? And , the ultimate one that Peggy Lee sang about  --  is this all there is ? " <p> Midlife can also be the start of significant loss . <p> " There are many losses at midlife that the surveys do n't measure , " said Sue Shellenbarger , a Wall Street Journal columnist who chronicled her own midlife crisis in her Work &; Family column . Overwhelming reader response propelled Shellenbarger to conduct her own study of 50 women at midlife . She reported her findings in the book , The Breaking Point : How Female Midlife Crisis is Transforming Today 's Women . <p> " Many are really suffering the loss of loved ones , youth , the dreams of young adulthood , the children and idealism of early career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is the fabric of day-to-day life . It is what we are feeling . Out of that turbulence can indeed come some wonderful perspective and wisdom and strength to start new things , but it does n't always feel good . " <p> Shellenbarger says that having a midlife crisis can push people to break through a sense of hopelessness and despair . Many women she studied used their regrets , their disappointments and their boredom to seek new lives , start new careers , take up creative hobbies . Sometimes that involved divorce , as it did in Shellenbarger 's case . <p> " Women 's lives have changed so dramatically . There 's a sharper increase in personal income , dramatic gains in educational level and career achievement , " Shellenbarger said . " All this fosters independence and self-reliance , creativity on the part of women . When they get to middle age , many women strike out on new adventures that pull them away from their marriages . " <p> ' MADE THEIR BEST EFFORT ' <p> Therapists Dan and Meg Haycraft say they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The common complaint , they say , is that women feel they have juggled so many roles as wife , mother and worker that they question their identities . <p> " They feel they have made their best effort to approach their partners and let their partners know about their discontent , " Dan Haycraft said . <p> If middle-age women feel their husbands are n't changing to meet their needs , they may begin thinking about divorce . <p> Nancy Hejna , 49 , of River Forest , said she spent five years preparing to end her marriage of 20 years . Hejna wanted her four children to grow older so they could better handle the marital separation and eventually the divorce . <p> " I feel like I 'm free , " said Hejna , who has been divorced for three years . " This is definitely the best time of my life . " <p> Hejna 's friends describe her as a housewife-turned-artist . <p> " I got to middle age and asked myself : Is this what I want ? Here I am in my suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my late 30s . I 'd been on this track of what other people had set before me to do . " <p> Hejna went back to work as an occupational therapist and returned to painting . <p> " I knew if I was going to commit to that creative piece of me , I 'd better do it now . " <p> ' PEAK CAPACITY ' <p> Researchers acknowledge that midlife has its problems . But middle-age people are usually more adept at handling those problems , they say . They have more problem-solving experience and usually more means to fix problems that arise . <p> " When you are in your 40s and 50s , lots of things could happen , " said Elaine Wethington , an assistant professor of human development at Cornell University who is considered the country 's leading researcher on middle age . <p> " But you are also at your peak capacity for mastering them and solving them . Middle-age people are more experienced and more resourceful . They also have more connections to other people who can help weather the crisis or solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vacha , 41 , realized his marriage was in trouble , he paid for counseling for two years , which ultimately helped him figure out a separation plan that minimized the effects on his 9-year-old daughter . <p> " I took the counselor 's advice , did the things I needed to and threw myself into my work and my hobbies . I did n't dwell on the negative aspects , " said Vacha , a computer programmer whose hobbies include playing hockey and strumming a guitar in a band called Headspins with other middle-age members . <p> Now Vacha is paying for his wife 's home and his own , an arrangement they worked out until she finishes nursing school . Had he been younger when the marriage disintegrated , he says , he would n't have had the money or the maturity to deal with the impending divorce . <p> " Overall , I 'm happier now . I do n't have the angst of being 20 and not knowing about life , " said Vacha . <p> " There was always a certain concern with what everyone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He also believes his interests in music and sports help him deal with getting older . <p> " Maybe that 's my way of hanging on to my youth , " he said . " When we go out and play a show , I play for myself . It 's an outlet . Some people like to garden . I like to play guitar . " <p> ' PRISON BREAK ' GIVES HER A BREAK <p> Once a self-described loner , Forest Park actress and artist Jennifer Taylor says that as she has aged , she has developed a network of woman friends who help her cope with getting older . Each Friday , in a funky west suburban Riverside coffee shop called the Blue Parrot , she meets with this informal group , most of whom are in their 40s . <p> " We 're tight , " she said . " It has become a real important part in keeping me buoyant and kind of in touch that I 'm not alone in these feelings of being left behind , not needed . " <p> Aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , 49 , says she has had to struggle with disappointment as her acting parts have dwindled since she turned 40 . <p> Her husband encouraged her to take a risk and do something that she really wanted to do : paint . Taylor opened up a storefront called Painted Board Studio in River Forest . When she was n't trying out for acting parts and commercials , she was painting and running her own business selling painted furniture . <p> Then last year , Taylor lost her Actors Guild health insurance because she did n't make enough money acting . She was devastated and decided to stop acting altogether . But then she got a call to try out for a small part in a new Fox TV series called " Prison Break . " <p> The part was only one line , three words in fact  --  " Your wife 's here . " But Taylor got the part and began to build up her one-liners in the series until her fourth episode , when she appeared in a scene making out with a guard on a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : this frumpy middle-age housewifey type going crazy in her gray outfit with a man on a table . It was great , " she said . " I felt like somebody gave me a nice big drink of water when I was parched . " <p> The bigger role has encouraged Taylor to stay in the acting business . Taylor says she feels she 's coming out of a depression that hit when she was 40 . The hard part , says Taylor , is realizing that she 's not going to accomplish everything she wanted . <p> " The dreams you had when you were younger are n't exactly happening , " she said . " It does n't turn out exactly how you thought . I thought I was going to be greater than Meryl Streep . " <p> THE EVENT , NOT THE AGE <p> The ability to honestly evaluate one 's life , to adjust one 's perception with reality is one way people at midlife can avoid having a crisis . <p> " Most people are constantly calibrating their views of reality , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good they are . The more attentive people are , the less likely there is going to be a big epiphany . " <p> Those who suffer midlife crises are those who have a distorted perception of their lives , Kessler said : " These are people who are out of sync . They thought they were going to be the company vice president , but they 're still in middle management . " <p> Recent research shows people are n't necessarily upset at turning 40  --  that their lives are half over and they have n't accomplished all they 'd hoped  --  but they are distressed over things that happen to them once they reach middle age , such as being diagnosed with cancer or losing a job . <p> " It was the event that made them rethink their lives , rather than turning age 40 , " Wethington said . <p> There 's evidence that age 50 may , in fact , be the new 40 . Because people are waiting later in life to move out of their parents ' homes , get married and assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that previous generations felt by age 40 is now experienced later and later , experts say . <p> With medical advances and the prevalence of plastic surgery , people are living longer and looking younger . <p> " Americans have a very different definition of what they think middle age is compared to 25 years ago , " explained Wethington . " Old age is further and further down the road . " <p> SHORT-TERM ANGST <p> Dr. Gene Cohen , director of the Center on Aging , Health and Humanities at George Washington University Medical Center , says middle age is a time of re-evaluation as opposed to crisis . It 's a time when the way people think changes . At midlife , people begin to see multiple solutions or even competing solutions to problems . <p> " It can be challenging . It can be turbulent , " he said . " But it 's focused , and it 's taking you somewhere , and it can often be to your advantage . " <p> Cohen said a true midlife crisis interferes with normal functioning at work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Normal angst at midlife is short-term . " You start to think about sunsets instead of sunrises . You start to think about the end of the life cycle , " Cohen said . " People begin to re-evaluate their lives . " <p> There are many advantages to aging , Cohen points out . Recent studies show people actually use more of their brain as they age . While those in their 20s and 30s rely mostly on their brains ' left hemisphere , which is more objective , brain scans show , by age 40 , people are using more of their brains ' right hemisphere , which is more subjective , Cohen says . <p> Cohen explains in his new book The Mature Mind that bringing the two hemispheres of the brain together contributes to more mature reasoning . <p> " That 's why people in society do n't like to appoint judges until they are in middle age or older , " he said . " They do this intuitively , but they probably appreciate this maturing of the mind . " <p> ' JUST ANOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will suffer a midlife crisis . Usually , such people are college educated and upper middle class , which is why a few experts call it a " crisis of luxury . " <p> " Some folks who have bigger issues to worry about view this as kind of frivolous and self-absorbed , " said Carr . " If you 're an inner-city person of color who is raising her grandchildren and does n't have a spouse , and you have hypertension and diabetes , age 50 is n't such a good thing . For that person , it 's not a midlife crisis , it 's just another crisis . " <p> One predictor of a midlife crisis is whether someone was overwrought when he or she turned 25 or 30 , a time some have coined as the " quarter life crisis . " <p> Yet , those who achieved exactly what they wanted in life can also be disappointed . Their achievements can feel hollow , and their sacrifices  --  often their relationships with their families  --  can seem too costly . <p> Sometimes the people most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n ' rollers who are grappling with getting older , but rather those who took few risks in their lives . <p> " The people who played it safe might be the ones who are most prone to ask : ' Is this all there is ? ' I 've played by the rules . I 've done everything I 'm supposed to , but I still feel this emptiness in my life , " said Carr . " For those people , modest risk-taking might actually be a good thing .
