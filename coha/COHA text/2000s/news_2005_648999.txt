<p> When Adam Taliaferro walks across a stage to receive his undergraduate degree from Penn State on May 14 , his slight limp should hardly be noticeable under his navy-blue graduation gown . <p> The limp is one of the few visible signs remaining from a catastrophic injury that left Taliaferro temporarily paralyzed from the neck down . The crown of Taliaferro 's helmet collided with an Ohio State running back 's knee in the waning seconds of a Buckeyes rout in Columbus in September 2000 . The blow shattered the fifth cervical vertebra in Taliaferro 's neck " like a walnut inside a nutcracker , " a doctor said later . <p> Doctors gave Taliaferro , a freshman cornerback at the time , a 3 percent chance of walking again . But four and a half years later , Taliaferro has returned to a mostly normal life , his remarkable recovery a testament to his will , his family 's strength and the support of Coach Joe Paterno and a Penn State community that embraced the Taliaferros in the immediate aftermath of the injury and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because all the credit for my recovery comes to me , " Taliaferro said . " But it was more than that that got me through this . I had a tremendous amount of support from a lot of people . " <p> The collision ended Taliaferro 's athletic career , and he will probably never run again , doctors said . But he returned to college less than a year after the accident . He will graduate with a 3.19 grade-point average and a degree in labor and industrial relations , he said . He intends to enroll in law school , attending Rutgers-Camden near his family 's home in Winslow , N.J. <p> Tucked away in the basement of that spacious home are boxes of cards and letters that Addie Taliaferro , Adam 's mother , did not have the heart to throw away . Duffle bags of cards , letters and gifts arrived at her doorstep every day in the weeks after Adam 's injury . <p> " If Adam did n't get 50,000 cards , " Addie said , " he did n't get one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Penn State colors , and flowers came from an alumnus of the Class of 1939 . Well-wishers wrote from Africa . Addie Taliaferro read the notes nightly back then , letting the misspellings of elementary school students help her temporarily forget her fear and pain . <p> Paterno dispatched an assistant coach , Joe Sarra , who has since retired , to be with the family around the clock . Taliaferro 's parents insisted he move into their home . Paterno flew in weekly . His wife , Sue , prayed for Taliaferro every morning while she swam laps , and she would make the four-hour drive to the hospital in Philadelphia to bring homemade chocolate chip cookies . <p> Dr. Wayne Sebastianelli , the director of sports medicine at Penn State , flew every week to check on Taliaferro . He began each visit with a kiss on the forehead , the one place he knew Taliaferro could feel . ( After Taliaferro began to regain his senses and movement , he asked Sebastianelli to stop . ) <p> Despite the dire outlook , the community and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Taliaferro . Visitors streamed through , from Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb to Taliaferro 's high school friends , who gave up their Saturday nights to visit the hospital . <p> A former Penn State student sent holy water from the Vatican , and the family rubbed so much on Adam 's face that his skin broke out . They instituted a no crying rule for all of their son 's visitors at the hospital . <p> " I did n't ever let them tell him he was n't going to walk , " Addie said . " If you did that , you were going to be in big trouble with me . " <p> About two weeks after the accident , Taliaferro began moving the big toe on his left foot . His father , Andre , broke down crying at the news . As the weeks passed , he regained movement in his hands , feet and legs . <p> By Christmas , he took his first steps  --  small ones with the aid of crutches  --  but steps that had answered his family 's prayers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleak outlook first offered by the doctors . Soon afterward , he walked out of the hospital . <p> His rehabilitation continued as he moved from using crutches to a cane to walking without assistance . He also began giving back to others as a way of thanking those who had helped him . Sarra changed roles from that of bedside support to helping Taliaferro schedule speaking appearances around his college work . <p> Taliaferro traveled around the country to talk to people who had had similar injuries . He continues to speak to victims of catastrophic injuries at the Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia whenever he returns to his home in southern New Jersey . <p> " The fact that he 's willing to give after what he 's lost is much more impressive than if he had never lost it , " said Paterno , who added that Taliaferro would have played in the National Football League . <p> The Penn State community raised so much money for Taliaferro that $300,000 earmarked for medical expenses ended up in a scholarship fund . The same thing happened in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Ginsburg , Taliaferro 's high school coach at Eastern , used the extra money raised from the local community to set up the Adam Taliaferro Foundation . The group has given $26,000 to five local athletes who sustained catastrophic injuries . Every year , a high school all-star football game called the Adam Taliaferro Classic in southern New Jersey raises money for the foundation . <p> Taliaferro 's volunteer work helped ease the pain of losing football , an adjustment that he realized would be difficult soon after he returned to Penn State in the fall of 2001 . Taliaferro stayed with the team as a student assistant , but he said that he struggled at first . " I was able to work out some with the guys , but when they put their cleats on and go out to practice , you really do n't know what your role is anymore , " Taliaferro said . " You do n't have that camaraderie when you hear guys come in and talk about a hard practice . But I knew I had to realize I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He focused instead on continuing his rehabilitation with the Penn State training staff , and he eased into becoming a regular student . Taliaferro remained on scholarship and received all the perks his teammates got , such as gear and clothing . <p> But he knew his future now depended much more on his performance in the classroom . After a semester or two of being known around campus as the injured guy , Taliaferro made the transition from student-athlete to plain student . <p> " The thing that impressed me most about Adam is his gratitude , " said Faith McDonald , a lecturer in Penn State 's English department . " I 'd ask him if he missed football , and he 'd say that he 's just glad that he can walk . " <p> Taliaferro has already served two internships , working over the summer with the N.F.L. Players Association and for Jerrold Colton , a New Jersey-based sports agent . <p> While he is uncertain which field of law he will choose , those who have watched his recovery predict success . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart who has been around him , " Paterno said . " There 's no bluster or anything to the kid . He 's just so likable . Thank God it turned out all right . " <p> Taliaferro said that part of him wonders what might have been . His hands can not grasp because of the injury , and he will probably undergo surgery to try to improve that . But he has managed to avoid too much second-guessing , focusing instead on a standard college experience , from dating the same girl for the past year to playing video games with his friends to cramming for tests . <p> Most important , he will flip his white tassel and walk away a graduate . <p> " My dad thinks it 's weird that I 've taken it so well , " Taliaferro said . " But I think that everything happens for a reason . I think to this point I 've done more after getting injured than I ever could have done playing .
