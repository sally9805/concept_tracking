<p> Nominated by friends Gayle and Ian Crocker : <p> " Among our friends , if there is one dinner invite you do not want to miss , it is at the home of Monica and Paul Hagedorn . Monica is from Padua , Italy , and has been cooking for her family since she was very young , as her mother worked . Monica can not only whip up to-die-for Italian cuisine but also enjoys cooking all-American meals for her all-American family . Her scalloped mushroom potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner were an even bigger hit than the fabulous turkey and dressing that she prepared . Since renovating her kitchen this past year , dinner at her home is both a culinary and artistic fest . " <p> When it comes to cooking and entertaining , looks matter . That 's why Monica Hagedorn puts energy into the little touches as well as the big things , from her flower arrangements and table settings up to her renovated kitchen . <p> " When Paul and I first moved into our house , a 1926 Mediterranean-Tudor home , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not match the style of the rest of the house , " said the former lawyer who 's a stay-at-home mom to Adriano , with a second child due in July . " Three years ago , we decided to completely renovate the kitchen and in doing so to try to create a kitchen that was functional , with gourmet-quality appliances , but at the same time reminiscent of an old-world kitchen . " The end result was recently featured in a design magazine . <p> Hagedorn entertains often , and she loves to serve cheese and wine from her kitchen island so that she can be part of the fun as she adds the finishing touches to dinner . <p> " When you have people over at your house , you have to wow them but at the same time make them feel welcome and comfortable , " she said . " It really does not need to be extremely complicated . It is amazing what a difference little things can make . " <p> * Who taught you to cook ? " I learned how to cook from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her in the morning to buy vegetables , meats and dairies for the daily meal and then helped her prepare it . " <p> * Culinary roots : " I come from the northeastern part of Italy . The food there is different from what Americans have come to associate with Italian cooking . It is not the tomato sauce , garlic and Parmesan cheese cuisine that people have in mind when they think about Italian food . There is an extensive use of seafood , given the proximity to the ocean , a frequent use of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon , given the extensive trades that took place between Venice and the Middle East , and a combined use of butter and olive oil . I think it is a more sophisticated cuisine . " <p> * Cooking style : " I mainly cook Italian , but I never follow a recipe . Usually I go to the grocery store and buy what looks good : vegetables , meat or seafood . Once I pick the main ingredient , I try to create a dish that incorporates what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook for ? " I cook for my family four to five nights a week . We often have spur-of-the-moment dinners with my stepdaughters and close family friends . " <p> * What is the magic ingredient that makes some cooks turn out great food ? " There is no magic ingredient . The trick is in picking excellent ingredients . That is something I learned from my grandmother . Try to buy what is local and what is in season . I always use fresh ingredients , rarely frozen and never canned . " <p> * Culinary ambition : " My stepdaughter CeCe just graduated as a pastry chef from Johnson &; Wales culinary institute . I would love to be able to go back to school and get a culinary degree . Perhaps one of these days when my children are grown , I will be able to fulfill that dream and open a small lunch place where people could find healthy Italian meals and at the same time buy small Italian antiques and Venetian artifacts , such as glassware and fabrics .
