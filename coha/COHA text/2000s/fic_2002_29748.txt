The Chocolate Cat Caper By JoAnna Carl New American Library Every town has a crooked lawyer , I said . But even crooks have the right to buy chocolate . Clementine Ripley is n't our town 's crooked lawyer , Aunt Nettie said scornfully . Clementine Ripley is just a crooked summer visitor . And I 'd be a lot happier if she kept her crookedness elsewhere . We ca n't refuse her business . We can refuse if we 're not going to get paid . Oh , I 'll make sure we 'll get our money before she gets her chocolate . Aunt Nettie knotted her solid fists on her solid hips and stood solidly on her solid legs . Solid is definitely the word for Jeanette TenHuis . Even her thick hair , blond streaked with gray , with its natural curl firmly controlled by a food-service hairnet , looked substantial and dependablehair that would n't stand for any nonsense . She is five-foot-four and may weigh 175 , but she does n't look fat . She looks like a granite statue hewn by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a big block , so he just whacked a little around the edges , then polished the whole thing smooth and shiny . But if I compared Aunt Nettie to one of the delectable chocolates she makes , I 'd say she was a Frangelico truffle ( described in her sales material as , Hazelnut interior with milk chocolate coating , sprinkled with nougat . ) . In other words , she 's firm outside , but soft at the heart and has a slightly nutty flavor . When I left the guy I sometimes refer to as Rich Gottrocks and gave up my career as a trophy wife , all my other relatives told me how stupid I was . Aunt Nettie offered me room , board , and a job running the business side of her chocolate shop and factory while I studied for the CPA exam . Of course , after a couple of days of working on her books , I saw she was n't being merely philanthropic . My uncle 's death eighteen months earlier had thrown her into a financial hole I hoped was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed a place where nobody knew my ex-husband , a place to lie low and gather energy for a new attack on life . So we made a good pair . Soft center or no , Aunt Nettie was quite capable of refusing to sell chocolates to Clementine Ripley , even if it cost her money . It was my job to keep her from doing that , so I spoke firmly . Listen , Aunt Nettie , when you brought me back to Warner Pier , you said the business side of TenHuis Chocolade was my responsibility . And the business side ca n't stand for you to snub a two-thousand-dollar order . That would buy a bunch of all-natural ingredients . So load those chocolates up . She rolled her round blue eyes , and I knew I 'd won . All right , Lee , she said . But you 'll have to deliver them . I wo n't speak civilly to Clementine Ripley . Sure . And you 'll have to use your minivan . Because of the air-conditioning . I 'll be glad to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that house . And make sure we get our money ! Cross my heart . I watched while Aunt Nettie loaded six giant silver trays with handmade truffles and bonbons and with fruits dipped in chocolate coating for Clementine Ripley . Candies in dark chocolate , milk chocolate , white chocolate ; strawberries and dried apricots half covered with dark chocolate ; fresh raspberries mounted on disks of white chocolate and drizzled with milk chocolateshe arranged them into swirling designs of yummy . Each type of truffle or bonbon was decorated in a different way or came in a different shape . A dark chocolate pyramid was coffee-flavored . The white-chocolate-covered truffle with milk chocolate stripes was almond-flavored , its milk chocolate interior flavored with Amaretto . The oval bonbon , made of dark chocolate and decorated with a flower , had a cherry-flavored filling . This went on through sixteen different kinds of truffles and bonbons . When I 'd worked behind the counter as a teenager , I 'd known them all . Now I could identify only a few , but that did n't matter . All were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every flavor could lift me into a state of ecstasy . Aunt Nettie 's chocolates were guaranteed to wow the guests at the fund-raiser Clementine Ripley was sponsoring for the Great Lakes Animal Rescue League . It was a big event , or so the Warner Pier weekly had claimed . Guests were coming from Chicago and Detroitall carrying big checks for the Rescue League . I snagged an Amaretto truffle Aunt Nettie had n't placed on a tray yet and bit into it , savoring every sweet , almond-flavored morsel . Every TenHuis Chocolade employee is allowed two free chocolates each working daya perk I found more pleasant than a company car would have been . When the first tray was completely filled , Aunt Nettie covered it with plastic wrap , and I picked it up and carried it toward the alley , where I had parked . Start the air-conditioning ! Aunt Nettie said . I will , I will ! I 'm not taking a chance on having a couple of thousand dollars ' worth of chocolate melt all over my van . Warner Pier 's summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the heat elsewhere in the Midwest . Most Warner Pier folks do n't bother to have air-conditioned cars , and many including Aunt Nettiedo n't even have air-conditioned houses , though she keeps the chocolate shop and workroom chilly . But the lakeshore does have a few really hot muggy days each summer , and this happened to be one of them . In Texas , we 've all given up trying to live without air-conditioning and it 's installed everywherein houses , offices , industrial plants , cars , trucks , and tractors . My used van had a Texas tag and enough Texas air-conditioning to keep chocolate from melting in any temperature the Great Lakes region was likely to hand out . I went back and forth out the back door , sliding the trays onto the floor of the van , making sure each tray was wedged firmly . Aunt Nettie did n't get a lot of orders for trays already arranged , but when she did , she wanted them to look artistic . She always arranged them herself , without the help of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workroom . These chocolates looked gorgeous . Aunt Nettie carried the last tray out , and I put it in the floor of the front seat . Then I looked at the array and sighed . They 're almost too beautiful to eat . Aunt Nettie gave a satisfied snort . They 'll eat them , she said . Now I 'll get the cats , and you can go . While Aunt Nettie went to the storage room , I popped into the rest room off the break room and freshened up . I had to duck to see the top of my head in the mirror ; I got a tall gene from both the Texas side and the Michigan Dutch side of my family , so I 'm just a shade under six feet . I tucked my chocolate-brown shirt with the TenHuis Chocolade logo into my khaki slacks . I rebrushed my hairwhitish-blond like the Michigan sideand clipped it into a barrette on the back of my neck . Then I added the merest touch of mascara , tinted faintly green like my Texas hazel eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat of medium pink lipstick . It was nice to look like myself again . Mr. Gottrocks , whose name was actually Richard Godfrey , always liked me to wear bright red lipstick and big hair , but I 'd left the glamour behind with my wedding ring . As I came out Aunt Nettie was arranging the last of Clementine Ripley 's special order of cat-shaped candies onto a smaller silver tray . I admired these , too . Each about three inches high , they were made of solid white chocolate , formed in a mold specially ordered from the Netherlands . They had been hand-detailed with milk chocolate glaze and colored chocolate , so that the blue eyes and the light brown markings of the cats mimicked the photo Clementine Ripley had provided of her Birman male , Champion Myanmar Chocolate Yonkers . To a non-cat-fancier like me , Yonkers looked as if a Siamese cat had decided to let his hair grow . He had immensely fluffy Persian-like fur , but had the delicate light brown paws , ears , nose , and tail of a Siamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , and his chocolate replicas looked scrumptious on their silver dish . Gorgeous ! I said . Aunt Nettie wrapped the dish with a huge sheet of food-service Saran , then picked up a small white box tied with blue ribbon from the table behind her . Here are the samples , she said . Samples ? For me ? No ! For Clementine Ripley . I do n't want my display ruined . So I packed a few extra chocolates for her to sample . I wrote her name on top . I laughed . Maybe you 'd better send an extra cat , so she wo n't get into those either . There 's a cat in there . Amaretto truffles are her favorite , though . She buys those every time she comes in . So I sent a half dozen . But I 'd better get my money ! No check , no chocolate . I talked to her assistantMs . McCoy ? and she assured me she 'd have the money ready . Good girl ! I shook my finger at Aunt Nettie . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chocolate comes out of the van until I have that check . Aunt Nettie smiled sheepishly . She 's much too understanding and patient . A year earlier she had let Clementine Ripley have chocolates for her big benefit party on credit . But in the offhand way of the really rich , Ms. Ripley neglected to pass on the invoice in a timely manner to the person who paid her bills . It was several months before Aunt Nettie got her money . This year we were n't going to let that happen . I 'd insisted that Clementine Ripley use a credit card , but that had n't worked either . Now I 'd arranged to get a check when the chocolates were delivered . I checked to be sure I had the invoice , slung my purse over my shoulder , and took the tray of cats to the van . I was settled behind the wheel when Aunt Nettie ran out , waving . Wait ! Take these . I rolled down the window , letting out valuable air-conditioned air , and took what she handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves . In case any of the chocolates shift , use these to move them back in place . I 'll drive slow and steady , I said . And I 'll try not to say anything stupid , either . Aunt Nettie laughed . You 're not stupid , Lee , she said . Bless her heart . I hope she 's right , but not everybody agrees with her . She waved as I drove off . Nothing 's very far away from anything else in Warner Pier . Clementine Ripley 's overly dramatic showplace home on the cliff at Warner Point was only two miles from TenHuis Chocolade , located on Fifth Street between Peach and Pear Avenues . I pulled out of the alley and very gently turned onto Peach Street , then followed that a block to Dock Street , the pride of Warner Pier . Dock Street has been turned into a real attractiona mile of marinas , all crammed with boats and yachts in the summer . And dividing the street from the marinas is a mile-long parka narrow series of green spaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Warner Pier marina , then walk across the park to reach a business district filled with good restaurants , antique and gift shops , art galleries , trendy and expensive clothing storesand the occasional specialty shop like TenHuis Chocolade . It 's pretty neat , or so we Warner Pier merchants think . I followed Dock Street , driving slowly because of the chocolates and because of the tourists who roamed the streets , until I was out of the business district . The older residential neighborhoods of Warner Pier were designed by Norman Rockwell in 1946 . At least , my mother always claims she grew up on the cover of an old Saturday Evening Post magazine . The town looks as if it 's under a glass dome . Just shake us , and it snows on the white Victorians , Craftsman bungalows , and modified Queen Anne cottages and on their lush , old-fashioned gardens . Warner Pier lies along the Warner River , not far upstream from the spot where the river enters Lake Michigan . In the 1830s , settlerssome from the Netherlands and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down all the native timber . With those trees gone , the next generation planted replacements , but they concentrated on fruit trees , and Warner Pier became a center for production of Michigan Gold , which was the early-day promoters ' nickname for peaches . By 1870 Warner Pier had become a town of prosperous fruit growers and ship ownerssolid citizens with enough money to build the substantial Victorian houses that today are being gentrified into summer homes or into bed-and-breakfast inns . Warner Pier is still a fruit-producing center , but today a lot of the area 's Michigan Gold comes from tourists and summer residents . I followed the curves of Dock Street to the showplace home of Clementine Ripley , one of Warner Pier 's most famous summer visitors . Most summer people come for the beaches and Victorian ambiance , but Ms. Ripley seemed to have come seeking seclusion . Several years earlier she had acquired ten acres of prime property on top of a bluff overlooking the Warner River , right at the point where it entered Lake Michigan . She built a low stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tower slumped at one end . That tower was apparently based on an abstract idea of a lighthouseor maybe planned as a squatty version of the Washington Monument . It was known to boaters up and down the lake as the sore thumb , because that 's what it stuck out like . The house might be highly visible from the lake , but it was not inviting . Signs warning boaters and swimmers to keep away were posted along the shore . Guards and a high brick wall kept Clementine Ripley private and protected from the land side . Clementine might well need protection , and from more than prying eyes . Her office was in Chicago , but she had a national practice in criminal law . As one of the nation 's toughest defense lawyers , she 'd kept a series of high-profile clients out of prison on charges that ranged from fraud to murder . Not a few peoplewitnesses she 'd shredded on the stand , prosecutors she 'd made look like circus clowns , former clients and their victims , plus the tabloid presshad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who loved everybody else in the world , did n't like her . She had n't told me why , but her feelings seemed to be deeper than a payment problem . So Clementine Ripley might need her guards , I told myself as I drove up to the metal security gate . The gate was probably eight feet high , and its grill seemed to snarl . I would n't have touched it on a bet ; the thing looked as if it would carry thousands of volts of electricity . I stopped by the intercom mounted on a post and punched a button on its face , feeling as if I was about to order a hamburger and fries . A disembodied voice answered , Yes ? Lee McKinney , with a delivery from TenHuis Chocolade . Just follow the drive up to the house , the voice said . The gate slid sideways , and I drove on in , almost frightened of what might happen once I was behind the brick wall and in the area controlled by Clementine Ripley . There was nothing scary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening . But the undergrowth in these particular woods was largely cleared out , and ahead I could see the long stone house , its tower leaning like a drunken troll . I drove on slowlystill remembering my fragile cargoand I coasted around the circular drive and came to a halt in front of the wide flagstone steps . On the steps was a hulking manbroad and tall . Ripley .
