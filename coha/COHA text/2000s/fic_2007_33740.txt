Chapter One " If he hits her again , I 'm going to kill the bastard . " " Why ? So she can testify against you and send you back to Folsom ? Been there , done that . Look at her . She 's not crying-she 's glaring at him . The guy 's probably her pimp , just making a point . Do n't interfere with business . Finish your beer and let 's get out of here . " AJ Temple threw a couple of five-dollar bills on the scarred surface of the bar and stood up . Miguel Fuentes rose slowly to his feet , his attention still on the couple at the other end of the bar . The beer can he left on the counter resembled a small chunk of crushed and mangled aluminum . AJ seemed to recognize Mik was just about ready to blow , and grabbed his arm to steer him toward the door . Unfortunately , they had to walk right by the muscle-bound jerk hanging on to the fragile-looking waif with the big , sad eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't dark enough to hide the distinct marks on the girl 's arm where square , meaty fingers kept a tight grip . Mik planted his feet and refused to move beyond the mismatched pair . " Let go of the lady . " When AJ tugged at his arm , Mik jerked loose . " I said , let her go . Now . " The stranger at the bar turned slowly and glared at both AJ and Mik through narrow , bloodshot eyes . Then he lumbered to his feet . As tall as he was , and as broad , he still had to look up at Mik , but that did n't appear to bother him a bit . He curled his lip in a soundless snarl . " Who the fuck are you ? " Mik almost laughed . If only he could tell him . Even better , show him . He could shift , right here in this seedy little bar . Change into a ferocious , snarling wolf and rip the guy 's throat out , just for effect . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't such a deeply guarded secret . Wished he could follow his true nature as a shapeshifter . He 'd go for the bastard 's throat and settle the problem , once and for all . It might make a mess of the place , but it would certainly shut the jerk up . Unfortunately , Mik knew he had to control himself no matter how badly the beast in him wanted a bite of this idiot . That did n't mean he could n't go for a little alpha-male posturing . Mik straightened his spine and puffed out his chest . His open hands hung deceptively loose at his sides . Of course , now the die was cast , AJ seemed to think it prudent to add his bulk for emphasis . He stepped up beside Mik , not quite as big , but every bit as powerful . " My buddy asked you to let go of her arm . It 's obvious you 're hurting the lady . " Before the jerk could answer , the woman slipped off the barstool and moved to one side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as if he caressed her bruised skin . She glanced nervously toward the back of the tavern , then wrapped her arms tightly around her narrow waist . Her long dark hair floated over her shoulders and down her slim back , almost to her butt . Thick bangs obscured her forehead and eyes . " It 's okay . We were having an argument . I ... " She stepped away , a small step , but it took her farther from the man who 'd hurt her and closer to Mik . " I was wrong . Jimmy here , well , he had a right to get upset . " I told you so . She 'll side with the bastard . AJ 's silent comment , mindtalking in the way of their kind , echoed in Mik 's head . She 's scared out of her fucking skull . What else is she gon na say ? C'm on , Mik . Out of here . Now . This guy 's not alone . For emphasis , AJ nodded to his left , in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was enough to see the half dozen rednecks lounging near the pool table , just waiting for a fight . He felt his hackles rise in response . Natural in a wolf but damned uncomfortable in a human . The bully was a local . AJ and Mik were fair game . Cursing under his breath , Mik turned away from the hopeless expression on the woman 's face and followed AJ out of the bar . He could n't help taking one final glance back at her , though . She looked frightened but still defi- ant next to the muscular bully . Her gaze lingered on Mik and AJ . Then her face twisted with pain as the man wrapped his fist in her long dark hair . Mik 's gut twisted , as if the bastard had reached inside and grabbed him as well . It almost killed him to turn away , but he followed AJ . He had no choice . Years of experience had taught Mik to trust his partner . It did n't mean he always had to like it . Once outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry air before he turned on AJ . " We could have taken them . There were only seven of ' em counting that sonofabitch . " AJ laughed and headed down the dusty street . His shadow stretched straight out in front of him , long and thin as the setting sun dropped lower in the sky . " That 's almost word for word what you said when you beat that last guy half to death . She is not worth seven to ten years in prison . Did n't your first incarceration teach you anything ? " Mik shook his head , trying unsuccessfully to erase the waif 's lost look from his mind . " Same thing your five years in Folsom taught you-not to get caught . Poor kid . She looks like she 's used to getting beat up . " AJ stopped and stared at Mik for a long , uncomfortable minute . " She probably is . Get over it . You can not right every wrong . You ca n't rescue every stray . Face it , you ca n't save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do , then move on to the next job . " Mik stared into the eyes of the man he loved more than anyone else in the world and realized he 'd never yet won an argument with AJ . He felt the anger flow out of him , leaving only disappointment , and he sighed . " I know you 're right . Unfortunately , being right does n't make it any easier to walk away . " Mik shoved his hands in his pockets , took another deep breath and let it out . " Let 's get dinner and get moving . I ca n't stay here in this dump , not knowing that little girl is hurting . " AJ slapped Mik 's shoulder . " She 's not a little girl and she 's not hurting . She 's probably just getting ready to go to work . Like I said , that guy 's most likely her pimp . She 's a whore , Mik . She 's probably a lot tougher than she looks , but if she 's broken , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? C'm on . I 'm with you ... let 's find a bite to eat and get out of this dump . " Mik looked around the squalid town square , at the scattered papers and trash blown into filthy piles in corners and up against fences , at the broken benches and dry grass in what might , at some point , have been a park . Now the area reeked of decay and misuse , and the few men standing on the corner opposite them were obviously there for reasons that would get them arrested in any other town . This place was ugly clear through , but they had n't come here for the scenery . Mik stared at AJ , looking into eyes so much like his own it would have been eerie if the similarity were n't so comforting . " I really thought we 'd find her . Baylor was so certain she 'd still be hanging around here . " AJ shrugged . " Not if she 's smart . She 's probably long gone . " He stopped at their car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , and tossed his jacket inside . Then he and Mik walked across the street toward the only restaurant in sight . " Bay said he had n't heard from his sister in years , and as good as Luc is at finding folks on the Internet , he 's not had any luck . No one around here even blinked when we asked about Mary Ellen Quinn . Without a picture or any real identification other than short , round , and blonde , I think finding her is a lost cause . " Mik felt a lump in his throat and swallowed it back . Lost cause . Just like the girl they 'd abandoned back there in that seedy bar . He did n't want to abandon Mary Ellen , either . Not with Chanku females so few and far between . Not that he and AJ needed a woman . They had each other . The two of them had realized their love was special shortly after they met , both of them serving time in Folsom on assault charges . They 'd bonded years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ulrich Mason , the head of Pack Dynamics , they 'd mated as wolves beneath a harvest moon and discovered an even more powerful love . The profound link that occurred during that mating had bound them with the sharing of every secret , every dream they 'd ever held . Mik glanced at AJ as they stepped up on the curb in front of the restaurant and felt the familiar clench in his gut , the hot flow of blood to his damned cock . AJ Temple embodied every sexual fantasy Mik had ever had . Even better , Mik knew AJ felt the same about him . It was impossible to keep secrets from a bonded mate . Still , even knowing he did n't want a woman for himself , the fact that they might be leaving one of their kind in this desolate town sickened Mik . The mere thought of a Chanku female , unaware of her heritage , unawakened , out there in the world with a mind filled with questions ... " You coming ? " AJ held the door open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry heat of the desert evening . Mik tabled his worries and followed his lover inside . AJ dug into his rare steak with obvious pleasure . Though their meal was surprisingly good , Mik spent more time shoving his food around the plate than actually eating . He could n't get the girl off his mind . Neither one of them . Not Mary Ellen . Not the whore . " It 's still early , " AJ said between bites . " We can probably make Phoenix by midnight if we leave now . " Mik nodded . Maybe distance would make him feel better . Right now he felt as if he wore his sense of gloom like a shroud . When the waiter came to clear their table , more than half of Mik 's huge slab of blood-rare prime rib was still sitting on his plate . He had the waiter pack it in a Styrofoam container , tucked the leftovers under his arm , and followed AJ out the door . The sky had turned from blue to black and the few working streetlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in daylight . It was time to go . Mik tossed the keys to AJ . The two of them had become a running joke within the pack , the fact that Mik carried the keys but AJ almost always drove . Mik was n't sure where the habit had formed , but for whatever reason , he felt perfectly comfortable with AJ behind the wheel . Maybe because it was so much fun to heckle him . Mik tossed the bag with the leftovers in the back of the SUV and hoped it would n't get lost amidst the piles of gear they were hauling . They 'd pulled the back seats out for this trip and thrown in a foam mattress in case they got caught out in bad weather without a hotel room available . Messy , but it worked . As part of Pack Dynamics , Mik had learned long ago to be prepared for the unexpected . This trip had been no different , following up on an international smuggling operation along the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast . The side trip through this southern part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been an added bonus , if he could call it that . Not finding her did n't sit well with Mik , or AJ either , for that matter . Mik climbed into the front passenger seat , buckled his seatbelt , and leaned back as AJ pulled out into the main street and headed for Phoenix . There was no rush to get home to San Francisco . Most of the pack was off on one assignment or another . Baylor Quinn had gone back to Maine to settle in with Shannon and Jake . Tinker , Luc , and Tia had something going on with the Montana pack . Ulrich Mason , head of Pack Dynamics , was off on one of his solitary hunts for more Chanku . Mik wished he had Ulrich 's uncanny ability to spot others of their ilk . Wished he 'd been able to find at least one of Baylor Quinn 's missing sisters . The ex-secret agent had n't seen his two siblings for almost ten years , but if Bay was Chanku , so were they . Two women carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their wolven heritage alive merely as unsatisfied longings and unfulfilled dreams . Mik settled back into the soft leather seat and closed his eyes . AJ turned on a country western station , all they 'd been able to pick up in English out here in the desert , and headed west . They 'd sleep in Phoenix tonight , maybe make it home tomorrow . Home . Nothing more than a room shared with AJ . One job after another . Mik thought of Luc and Tia , and of course , Tinker . Would Tinker ever find someone of his own , or was the relationship with Luc and Tia enough ? The big guy seemed happy and Tia obviously had more than enough love to share . Still , Tinker always looked so lost , as if he were searching for something or someone . Pondering on Tinker and other questions of note , Mik drifted off to sleep to the glorious sound of Patsy Cline telling him to stand by his man . Tala never expected to sleep , not with every bone in her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy had given her , but she realized she was awake and her hiding place was moving . More importantly , she smelled food . Something warm and delicious and not too far out of reach . Tala stretched her hand over the piles of camping gear and miscellaneous duffle bags and bit back a groan . Every move was agony . Damn Jimmy and his drunken pack of fools . After those two gorgeous men bailed out on her , back at the bar , Jimmy 'd just turned her over to the guys . For punishment , he said . To teach her a lesson she deserved . She could still hear the click when he 'd turned the lock on the front door . At the time , Tala had n't been sure if she was going to come out of that damned bar alive , but she should have known Jimmy would n't let anyone do anything to injure her permanently . Tala wanted to think it was because he cared , but the truth of it was she was worth too much to Jimmy alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . She knew he liked to watch , too . Jimmy 'd been laughing when he shoved her into the waiting arms of his buddies . Not that Tala did n't like sex , but taking six stinking idiots in just under an hour had almost pushed her over the top . Her ass hurt , her throat burned , and she did n't even want to consider what kinds of STDs they 'd exposed her to . As bad as it was , though , Jimmy 's beating had hurt more . Somehow , somewhere along the way , she 'd convinced herself he actually loved her . Now how pathetic was that ? Tala felt an unfamiliar burning at the back of her eyes . It took a minute to realize she was crying . No ! Tala did not cry . Never . With an act of supreme will , she stopped the moisture and gritted her teeth against the pain . She 'd wanted to leave Jimmy Cole for a long time now . Maybe this time she 'd make it . At least the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver 's seat , tucked down on some kind of soft mattress on the floor and wrapped in an even softer blanket with a couple of unrolled sleeping bags to hide beneath . If only she could n't smell food . Mouth watering , Tala steeled herself against the ache in her belly and hoped like hell the two men just on the other side of the seat would n't hear her moving around . They 'd wanted to help . At least the big one had , the one with the flowing black hair and the gorgeous cheekbones . He reminded her of an ancient warrior , almost like he 'd ended up in the wrong century . She 'd felt his concern . It had been the strangest sensation , almost like a voice in her head . He 'd looked at her with compassion , not pity , and for some reason she 'd felt as if they had something in common , as if they both understood suffering . Well , after tonight , Tala was through suffering . Jimmy might have taken care of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but tonight was the last straw . He 'd called her a whore , which she was , of course , but then he 'd gone and thrown her to that pack of sex-starved lunatics like she was nothing more than a piece of meat . They 'd fallen on her , dogs after a bitch in heat . Three at a time , stabbing into her like she was just a convenient hole . And is n't that all you are ? Damn . Tala wished the voices in her head would go away , or at least shut the fuck up . It was bad enough she could n't remember anything before Jimmy found her in that stinking alley , but between the voices and the dreams , sometimes Tala felt as if she were losing what little mind she had left .
