In a time of national crisis , FDR 's advisors urged him to assume dictatorial powers . He knew better . <p> President Bush is under criticism for asserting " inherent " presidential authority to go around the back of Congress and secretly authorize warrantless wiretaps , in violation of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . During an equally dire time in this nation 's history , the winter of 1933 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt was also tempted to circumvent Congress and assume extraconstitutional powers . But on his first day in office , FDR decided not to be a dictator , though many editorial pages and columnists were calling for just that . <p> On Sunday , March 5 , 1933 , his first full day in the presidency , Franklin Delano Roosevelt awoke in a creaky narrow bed in the small bedroom of the White House family quarters he had chosen for himself . After his valet , Irvin McDuffie , helped him with the laborious task of putting on his iron leg braces and trousers , McDuffie rifted him into his armless wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's schedule called for him to attend morning services at St. Thomas 's Church with his family , host a luncheon for 20 at the White House , and then chair an emergency Cabinet meeting , where he would outline his plans to call Congress into emergency session . <p> None of the staff or reporters who saw him that Sunday noticed that FDR was anything other than his usual convivial self . He had stayed up past one o'clock the previous night talking with Louis Howe , his long-time chief aide and campaign strategist , while Eleanor and their five children attended the Inaugural Ball without him . The disabled president , now 51 years old , had n't wanted to sit passively while everyone else danced ; passive was not his style . Besides , he and Howe had important things to discuss , beginning with how to extricate the United States from its gravest crisis since the Civil War . <p> The American economic system had gone into a state of shock , its vital organs shutting down as the weekend began . On Friday , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trade bolted its doors for the first time since its founding in 1848 . The terrifying " runs " that began the year before on more than 5,000 failing banks had stripped rural areas of capital and now threatened to overwhelm American cities . At dawn on Saturday , only a few hours before FDR 's swearing in , the governors of New York , Illinois , and Pennsylvania signed orders closing the banks in those states indefinitely , which meant that 34 out of 48 American states , including the largest ones , now had no economic pulse . Each state 's closure had its own financial logic , but collectively they proved merciful . Without them , Saturday morning would have brought even more ruinous bank runs , with legions of depositors descending on their banks in desperation at the very moment the new president took the oath of orifice . <p> The outgoing president , Herbert Hoover , was on his way back to California , a study in failure . As late as 1 a.m. on Inauguration Day , he was still haggling with FDR on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they rode in uncomfortable silence to the Capitol . Hoover 's brilliant understanding of complex issues had brought him and the country nothing . For more than three years , since the aftermath of the stock market crash , he had been sullen and defensive as disease spread through the American economy . <p> As frightening as life had become since the Great Depression began , this was the bottom , though no one knew that at the time . The official national unemployment rate stood at 25 percent , but that figure was widely considered to be low . Among non-farm workers , unemployment was more than 37 percent , and in some areas , like Toledo , Ohio , it reached 80 percent . Business investment was down 90 percent from 1929 . Per capita real income was lower than three decades earlier , at the turn of the century . If you were unfortunate enough to have put your money in a bank that went bust , you were wiped out . With no idea whether any banks would reopen , millions of people hid their few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at night without a fight . The savings that many Americans had spent a lifetime accumulating were severely depleted or gone , along with 16 million of their jobs . When would they come back ? Maybe never . The great British economist John Maynard Keynes was asked by a reporter the previous summer if there were any precedent for what had happened to the world 's economy . He replied yes , it lasted 400 years and was called the Dark Ages . <p> Late in 1933 , a prominent journalist , Earle Looker , peered backwards several months to assess the Hobbesian stakes as FDR assumed office : " Capitalism itself was at the point of dissolution . Would men continue to work for profit as our forefathers understood it and as our people now understand it ? This was a real question , for money was now useless . Would it be necessary soon to organize our families against the world , to fight , physically , for food , to keep shelter , to hold possessions ? " <p> Even two generations later , the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just as traumatic as Pearl Harbor or the destruction of the Twin Towers , " the scholar Richard E. Neustadt , who was a teenager at the time , recalled . " It was n't on television , but the banks were failing everywhere , so you did n't need television to see what was going on . " <p> Roosevelt 's Inaugural Address had begun the process of restoring hope , but not everyone caught the new mood right away . The press coverage that morning largely downplayed or ignored FDR 's line : " The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . " The New York Times and most other newspapers relegated the line to their inside pages , while focusing instead on the vivid wartime allusions he employed five times during his speech  --  martial metaphors that suggested that there was , in fact , plenty to fear after all . The greatest applause from the large crowd on the east side of the Capitol came when Roosevelt said : " I shall ask Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe . " <p> The United States had not been " invaded by a foreign foe " since 1812 , but this felt like it . Arthur Krock of the Times compared the mood in Washington on Inauguration Day to " a beleaguered capital in wartime . " For the first time since the Civil War , armed men patrolled the entrances to federal buildings , while machine gunners perched on rooftops . Editors knew that the world war , just 15 years in the past , had concentrated great power in the hands of Woodrow Wilson 's government . To them it looked as if FDR were proposing the same thing . And so the approving headline , " For Dictatorship If Necessary , " ran in the New York Herald-Tribune on March 5 , with similar notes stuck in the Inauguration coverage of other major papers . <p> Exactly what was " necessary " ? No one knew , including Roosevelt . Even before being sworn in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a festive term he preferred to Herbert Hoover 's " moratorium " ) to give the people who now ran the country a few days to figure out what to do . Then what ? Should he assume wartime authority on a temporary basis ? Call out the Army to protect banks and maintain order ? Mobilize veterans ? Unrest was already growing in the farm belt , where mobs had broken up bankruptcy auctions . Four thousand men had occupied the Nebraska statehouse and five thousand stormed Seattle 's county building . The governor of North Carolina predicted a violent revolution , and police in Chicago clubbed teachers who had not been paid all school year . Everywhere , bank runs threatened to turn violent . By the Inaugural weekend , police in nearly every American city were preparing for an onslaught of angry depositors . At least some were certain to be armed . <p> With so many banks involved , the U.S. Army  --  including National Guard and Reserve units  --  might not be large enough to respond . This raised the question of whether the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of martial law . The temptation must have been strong . It hardly seems a coincidence that FDR decided that the first radio speech of his presidency would be specially addressed to a convention of the American Legion , the million-member veterans ' organization co-founded after World War I by his fifth cousin , Theodore Roosevelt Jr . <p> The short speech was scheduled for that Sunday evening at 11:30 EST , with all radio networks carrying it live across the country . In preparing for the broadcast , someone in the small Roosevelt inner circle offered the new president a typewritten draft of suggested additions that contained this eye-popping sentence : <p> " As new commander-in-chief under the oath to which you are still bound I reserve to myself the right to command you in any phase of the situation which now confronts us . " <p> This was dictator talk an explicit power grab . The new president was contemplating his " right " to command World War I veterans  --  mostly men in their late 30s  --  who had long since reentered civilian life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States on entering military service and that the 1919 founding document of the American Legion pledged members to help " maintain law and order " and show " devotion to mutual helpfulness . " But the commander in chief had no power over them . Here Roosevelt would be poised to mobilize hundreds of thousands of unemployed and desperate men by decree , apparently to guard banks or put down rebellions or do anything else he wished during " any phase " of the crisis , with the insistence that they were duty-bound to obey his concocted " command . " <p> That word " dictator "  --  had been in the air for weeks , endorsed vaguely as a remedy for the Depression by establishment figures ranging from the owners of the New York Daily News , the nation 's largest circulation newspaper , to Walter Lippmann , the eminent columnist who spoke for the American political elite . " The situation is critical , Franklin . You may have no alternative but to assume dictatorial powers , " Lippmann had told FDR during a visit to Warm Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Smith , the Democratic nominee for president in 1928 , recalled with some exaggeration that " during the World War we wrapped the Constitution in a piece of paper , put it on the shelf and left it there until the war was over . " The Depression , Smith concluded , was a similar " state of war . " Even Eleanor Roosevelt , more liberal than her husband , privately suggested that a " benevolent dictator " might be what the country needed . The vague idea was not a police state but deference to a strong leader unfettered by Congress or the other inconveniences of democracy . Amid the crisis , the specifics did n't go beyond more faith in government by fiat . <p> Within a few years , " dictator " would carry sinister tones , but  --  hard as it is to believe now  --  the word had a reassuring ring that season . So did " storm troopers , " used by one admiring author to describe foot soldiers of the early New Deal , and " concentration camps , " a generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservation Corps that would be established by summer across the country . After all , the Italian Fascist Benito Mussolini , in power for a decade , had ginned up the Italian economy and was popular with everyone from Winston Churchill to Will Rogers to Lowell Thomas , America 's most influential broadcaster . " If ever this country needed a Mussolini , it needs one now , " said Sen. David Reed of Pennsylvania , outgoing President Hoover 's closest friend on Capitol Hill . The speech draft prepared for FDR brought to mind Mussolini addressing his Black-Shirt followers , many of whom were demobilized veterans who joined II Duce 's private army . <p> Roosevelt came to office just as the appetite for strong leadership seemed to be surging worldwide . For Americans , German chancellor Adolf Hitler was worrying but new , his leadership to be ratified in a legal election held across Germany that very day , March 5 . While Hitler was already seen in the United States as a reckless buffoon , almost no one in the country yet focused on the threat posed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randolph Hearst , seemed to favor dictatorship . The Hearst empire extended to Hollywood , where Hearst that winter had personally supervised the filming of an upcoming hit movie called " Gabriel Over the White House " that was meant to instruct FDR and prepare the public for a dictatorship . The movie 's hero is a president played by Walter Huston who dissolves Congress , creates an army of the unemployed , and lines up his enemies before a firing squad . FDR not only saw an advance screening of the film , he offered ideas for script rewrites and wrote Hearst from the White House that he thought it would help the country . <p> " There was a thunder in the air as when the Fascisti marched upon Rome , " wrote one journalist close to the Roosevelt camp of the fevered climate that chilly March weekend . " It was the same tension that quivered about the Kremlin at the beginning of the Five Year Plan . Insiders thought there was to be a peaceful revolution involving a dictatorship . " <p> FDR knew the consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press  --  came to him not long after the Inauguration and told him , " Mr. President , if your program succeeds , you 'll be the greatest president in American history . If it fails , you will be the worst one . " " If it fails , " the new president replied , " I 'll be the last one . " <p> This sounds melodramatic to Americans in the 21st century , when freedom is flourishing in so many parts of the world . But during the 1930s , democracy was on the run , discredited even by subtle minds as a hopelessly cumbersome way to meet the challenges of the modern age . At the time , history offered little precedent for a leader taking power amidst a severe military or economic crisis without seizing more authority for himself . The few republics ever established  --  from ancient times to modern Europe  --  had eventually bent before such demands . So did the American system . During the Civil War , Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus and twisted the Constitution in order to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American 's economic elite about the banking crisis that on FDR 's first day in office more than a dozen of them  --  prominent bankers , congressional committee chairmen , emerge with a consensus that Roosevelt should assume dictatorial control . That afternoon Adolph Miller , a member of the Federal Reserve , suggested a single law that would put " the whole powers of the government in the hands of the President . " He argued that " This is a war . Do n't bother with the details . It is n't possible to formulate a plan of legislation . " Fed Chairman Eugene Meyer agreed ; FDR 's Treasury Secretary William Woodin revealed that the idea had already carried farther than they knew . The governors of many of the 48 states were coming to Washington the next day , and Woodin told the group confidentially that a committee of them was set to endorse the idea of the president assuming full wartime powers . <p> But on March 5 , 1933 , an astonishing thing happened-or more precisely , did not happen . The draft of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of veterans and other Americans , but for nothing more than the speech files of the Roosevelt Library , where it lay unexamined for more than 70 years . The five-minute speech that FDR delivered that night built on the military tone of the Inaugural . He argued for the " sacrifice and devotion " of wartime and noted that it was " a mistake to assume that the virtues of war differ essentially from the virtues of peace . " But there was no hint of the need for a private army . <p> No one knows who wrote the unused draft or why FDR discarded the suggested additions , but something inside the man kept him from moving in an extra-constitutional direction . Some combination of personal and democratic conviction set him on a different course , at once more traditional and bold . This most pragmatic of modern American presidents sensed the unworkable nature of untrammeled power , even in the hands of the only person he completely trusted  --  himself . <p> Instead of mobilizing a militia , FDR had mobilized a group of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before to produce a workable plan to solve the banking crisis . While the economic elite met and urged a more authoritarian approach , this smaller group of men , working round the clock and sleeping on couches , emerged with a three-pronged plan to save the nation 's banking system . <p> First , because the president had no explicit power to close banks , they urged him to use the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act , an obscure wartime provision that was intended to prevent gold transfers that could help the Germans . The original wartime measure was temporary and had long since expired . But when economic conditions worsened in 1932 , a clever legislative draftsman at the Hoover Treasury had dusted off the bill and taken the legally questionable step of changing the " implementation language " to make the 1917 act permanent . <p> This was probably illegal , but the Hoover men were frightened and not in the mood for legal niceties . FDR agreed , and invoked the Trading with the Enemy Act to declare a national bank holiday . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Ogden Mills , developed banking reform legislation ; FDR called Congress into special session to pass it . <p> The legislation distinguished three classes of banks : A , B , and C. The " A " banks were basically healthy and could be reopened quickly ; the " B " banks were shaky but could open in the weeks ahead if they were bolstered ; and the " C " banks were insolvent and would stay closed unless they were reorganized . But even the " C " class banks were treated gingerly . To take the sting off , they decided to call the receivers of those banks " conservers . " <p> When FDR adopted the Mills plan ( without ever acknowledging its author ) , many progressives and radicals felt a rare moment for radical reform had been missed . Sen. Bronson Cutting of New Mexico wrote with " a sick heart " about the failure to nationalize the banks when the opportunity arose , calling it " President Roosevelt 's greatest mistake . " It could have been accomplished , Cutting later said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaFollette Jr . of Wisconsin and Edward Costigan of Colorado paid a call at the White House to press the point , arguing that many other countries had nationalized banks . But they found the president firmly opposed to putting so much of the nation 's wealth in the hands of the state . He always believed banks should be in private hands , he told them , even when they had just about wrecked the country . <p> The third element of the plan was designed by the president himself . On March 8 , he hit on a way to retrieve most of the gold that had seeped out of the banks in the previous weeks . At his direction , the Fed announced that it would publish a list of those who had withdrawn gold coins or bullion since February 1 and not returned the gold as of Monday , March 13 . Suddenly , sheepish investors began to form lines at banks , determined to avoid having their names printed in the newspapers as unpatriotic hoarders . By Friday , March 10 , an estimated 4,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing back $300 million in gold and gold certificates . By then , with the Emergency Banking Bill completed and the fiscally conservative budget bill on the way , investor confidence was beginning to stir again . <p> Moley wrote in 1939 that the key moment of the Hundred Days was the rescue of the banks . " Capitalism , " he concluded , " had been saved in eight days "  --  without the presidential assumption of dictatorial powers . <p> In the days ahead , FDR moved far from where that unused American Legion draft would have taken him , passing the word on Capitol Hill that he did not believe in a constitutional dictatorship and asking his friend Felix Frankfurter to tell Lippmann to stop hawking dictatorship and disrespect of Congress in his columns . It was not as if Roosevelt was letting the cup pass ; for the next 12 years , he would fully exploit the authority of the presidency , sometimes overreaching to the point where his enemies accused him of becoming a dictator . He would flirt with fascistic ( or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937 try to pack the Supreme Court . But even then , he would do so in the context of democracy , without private armies or government-by-decree . Even at his worst , he would eventually submit his schemes for the approval of Congress . Instead of coercion , he chose persuasion ; instead of drawing the sword , he would draw on his own character and political instincts . He would draw , too , on the subconscious metaphor of his own physical condition . Although it was only rarely mentioned in the press , the American people knew at the time that he had polio ( though not the extent of his disability ) and it bound them to him in ways that were no less powerful for being unspoken : If he could rise from his paralysis , then so could they . <p> The deeper questions would take time to plumb . If character was to be FDR 's weapon for confronting the crisis , how was it forged and then deployed ? Which complex combination of temperament , background , and experience allowed Roosevelt to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verdict of history on his expansion of government and particular policy prescriptions , this much is clear : Rather than succumbing to dictatorship or chaos , the United States underwent a " laughing revolution , " as a reporter covering FDR put it , the projection of one man 's faith in his own performance and in the capacity of democratic institutions to confront the terror of the unknown . <p> In March of 1933 , the new president did not have to mobilize aging members of the American Legion under martial law . Franklin Roosevelt mobilized himself and his latent talent for leadership . He found his voice , and his voice defined America . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Photograph courtesy of The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library and Museum . <p> By Jonathan Alter <p> <p> Jonathan Alter is a Newsweek columnist and a Washington Monthly contributing editor .
