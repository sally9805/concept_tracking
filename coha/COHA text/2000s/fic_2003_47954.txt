At last , " my husband said , when I had locked up for the night and come to bed . <p> " You knew I would , " I said . <p> " But I did n't know when . " Propped up in the recently rented hospital bed , he peered more closely at my chosen book . A novel by Patrick O'Brian . " Wait , no , no , " he said . " You must begin at the beginning . " <p> " But I like the sound of this one , " I said , drawing out the swish of The Mauritius Command . <p> " Ah , but you want to be there when Aubrey and Maturin meet . " <p> " I can always go back , " I said , only slightly petulant , aware that at another time we 'd never see again I would have been reading favorites , Trevor , Atwood , or Munro . Or tapping into the wall of biographies across from our beds , Rowley 's Christina Stead , or Ellman 's Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs : Rivard , Roethke , Ruefle , Solomon , Szymborska . <p> His eyes gleamed . " But Aubrey and Maturin meet at such an unlikely place-especially to begin the series . They meet at a concert . Italians on little gilt chairs are playing Locatelli . " He stopped , out of breath . " Never mind . " <p> " So what 's the first one ? " If I was going to do this , give him this gift , so to speak , I must do it right . He named Master and Commander , and , ignoring the irony , I did as commanded and retrieved Master and Commander from his study next door . Carefully I settled in beside him , our old queen set flush to his new bed , and embarked . In running commentary over years of hurried breakfasts and long dinners , he 'd extolled to me Patrick O'Brian 's sheer genius ; how in the first novel he delivers to the reader in dramatic scenes of tense negotiation a detailed account of everything that Jack Aubrey must buy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " introduction " later , I said , " I see what you mean . A most prickly meeting . Maturin delightfully pissy because a rapt Aubrey , from his seat in the scraggly audience , is audibly ' conducting ' the quartet a half beat ahead . " <p> " Do n't forget their terse exchange of addresses as if for a duel , " he said , laughing and coughing . I looked toward the oxygen machine , then at him . He shook his head . <p> Relieved , I slid the damp shoulder of his nightshirt into place . " Conflict on page one , " I said , making us both happy . <p> Fifty pages later , when I murmured , " Mmmmmm , " he said , " What ? Tell me . " He turned on the pillow with an effort and put aside his own O'Brian , The Truelove . So I read for him : " . . . the sun popped up from behind St. Philip 's fort-it did , in fact , pop up , flattened sideways like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of the land with a distinct jerk . " <p> " ... distinct jerk , " he repeated . <p> I said again " . . . drawing its bottom free of the land with a distinct jerk . " A shared blanket of satisfaction settled over us , and we went back to our books , companionably together , and companionably apart . <p> When I stopped reading to bring him a fresh glass of water to chase his myriad pills , he wanted to know where I was now . I slipped back into bed and tented the book on my flannel chest as I described how Mowett , an earnest member of the square-rigged ship 's crew , is explaining sails to a queasy Maturin , and here my husband smiled wryly in queasy recognition of feeling queasy . I took his hand , and went on to describe how Maturin affects interest , although he is exceedingly dismayed to be getting this lesson at the appalling height of forty feet above the roiling seas . " Meanwhile , the reader is getting the lesson , too-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read , " The rail passed slowly under Stephen 's downward gaze-to be followed by the sea . . . his grip on the ratlines tightened with cataleptic strength . " <p> " It makes me want to start all over again , " my husband said . Then , not to be seen as sentimental , he held up his book to show he 'd just finished the most recent O'Brian . It slipped to the rug , and we left it there . <p> " You could read Dave Barry now , " I said , acknowledging the only good thing about our new sleeping arrangement . My husband used to read Barry 's essays in bed , laughing so hard the bed would shake , shake me loose from whatever I was reading . Annoyed , I 'd mark my page and say , " Okay , read it to me . " The ensuing excerpt was a tone change and mood swing one too many times , because I finally banished Dave Barry from the bed after his column titled " There 's Nothing like Feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pacing with laughter . In it , Dave Barry refers to an article published in a Scottish medical journal , " The Collapse of Toilets in Glasgow . " Barry says , " The article describes the collapsing-toilet incidents in clinical scientific terminology , which contrasts nicely with a close-up , full-face photograph , suitable for framing , of a hairy and hefty victim 's naked wounded butt , mooning out of the page at you , causing you to think , for reasons you can not explain , of Pat Buchanan . " We said it again and again . It answered everything : " for reasons you can not explain . " <p> " Do you want a Barry book ? " I asked . He did n't answer . He was either sleeping or wishing I would shut up . <p> When we were about to leave for radiation , he was still bereft of a new O'Brian . I found him standing in his study , leaning on a walking stick from his collection , now no longer an affectation . <p> " The W 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air with his stick . " It 's Wodehouse I 'm after . " <p> " Why Wodehouse ? " I said . Jeeves , the perfect valet and gentleman 's gentleman , would be totally disapproving of how my husband 's shirts went un-ironed and how his trousers drooped on his thinning hips . " I 'm almost finished with Trevor 's After Rain , it has that startlingly dark story about- " <p> " I think I 'll read Wodehouse , " he said , his jaw set . Out of breath , he slumped into his desk chair and pointed again . " But I ca n't reach him . " On the shelves behind where my husband was pointing ranged the two hundred-plus books he 'd edited at a Boston publishing house , and the four he 'd written , the last novel , A Secret History of Time to Come , included by the New York Museum of Natural History in a time capsule that would outlast us all . " We have too many books , " he said . <p> " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my skirt before the wall of English and European Fiction , I mounted the wobbly wooden ladder we swore at on principle every time we retrieved an out-of-reach book . Waugh Winterson Wodehouse . I called down three titles before he nodded at the fourth . The Code of the Woosters . " Why Wodehouse ? " I asked again on my descent . <p> " Ah , you have n't read Wodehouse yet . Arch , mannered humor . You 'll see . " Then , as if anticipating my early mutiny against O'Brian in deference to Wodehouse , his eyes narrowed , and he instructed , " Keep with the O'Brians for now . " <p> We left for the hospital , armed with our respective books . On the way , I mentioned that Raymond Chandler , also English , and Wodehouse had both attended the posh prep school Dulwich College . " Dul-ich , but spelled Dulwich , " my husband said , surprised by Chandler . <p> Our bookish , competent doctor always wanted to know what we were reading . My husband waved the Wodehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nash , " he said , and read , " In my salad days , I thought that P. G. Wodehouse was the funniest writer in the world . Now I have reached the after-dinner coffee stage , and I know that he is . " <p> " Woadhouse , " the doctor said , making a note on his prescription pad . <p> " W-o-o-d . I hope he 's still funny , " my husband said , peering at the doctor over his glasses . " I 'm way past the after-dinner coffee . I 've reached the medicine stage . " <p> A week later , we were again side by side , my husband 's bed rising smoothly and electronically to a barely comfortable position I tried to match with pillows , despairing of the difference in height . I 'd finished Master and Commander and put it in a safe place because the doctor had meticulously written his home phone number inside its cover . Post Captain was next . My husband 's long fingers , thin and bony , were oddly free of books because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aubrey/Maturin , The Wine-Dark Sea . His eyes were alertly closed beneath the Walkman 's earphones curving over his new , silky growth of hair . <p> When he stopped listening to take his pills , I asked him to recall what he 'd liked best about Post Captain . I closed my eyes against a hysterical welling up of water . And when he 'd told me , I thought yes , yes , after years of reading and rereading , arguing , damning , and praising , I knew now almost exactly what he would say . Although I did n't tell him this-but tested more . I badgered him about the repetition of one battle scene after another , asked him to name his favorite title in the series , asked him if Maturin ever dies . I moved on to Ford 's The Good Soldier . Did n't the narrator 's equivocation grate on his nerves ? Yes and no . Who was Dante 's best translator ? Yes , yes . And what did he think of the poem in Pale Fire ? <p> " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been in days . " Enough . " <p> The next evening , when he had finished both sides of the first tape , he told me to look in his desk for a second Walkman . Why did n't matter . " Now , listen to this tape , " he said . <p> " You 're still seducing me with literature , " I accused him . <p> He took the tape from his Walkman and inserted it into mine . <p> " No . No . I ca n't , " I said . " I 'll get the plots mixed up . " Already I was awash in the unfamiliar world of sloops and frigates , admiring of royals , baffled by masts and yards , and dipping in and out of A Sea of Words : A Lexicon and Companion for Patrick O'Brians Seafaring Tales , chastely beside me on the bed . In love again . <p> " Here , " he said . " Listen . " <p> I donned the earphones , and because he was watching , I closed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand found my hand as a calming voice began , " A purple ocean , vast under the sky and devoid of all visible life apart from two minute ships racing across its immensity . " <p> Until my husband 's hand slipped from mine , until his breath failed , until I called 911 , until the ambulance arrived to provide our last voyage together , on that last evening I sailed precariously in two different seas , astride two listing vessels , keeping a third in view against a dark horizon , reading in his wake . <p>
