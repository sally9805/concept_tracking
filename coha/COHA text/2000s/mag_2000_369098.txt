Harry loved a girl named Diane . He guesses he was 12 when the very sight of her  --  the hazel-eyed beauty from the next town over in North Carolina  --  knocked him back on his heels . " I think it might have been at a church social , " he says , 59 now and dusted at the temples . Harry courted her with the little time he did n't spend working the tobacco and cotton fields his family farmed : " We wrote to each other when I went away in the service . She was my military sweetheart . " <P> They moved north and were married in 1965 , and 30 years ago , they opened a restaurant that became an institution in downtown Newark , N.J. SOUL OF THE SOUTH , HEART OF THE CITY , say the place mats at Je 's Restaurant , where Harry and Diane worked alongside each other . They raised three handsome sons and sent them to college , and all three , despite other pursuits , continued to help their parents run the restaurant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you know what I mean ? This is the place , and Diane was the soul of it , " says David Morton , a police officer . Morton and thousands of others are part of a family of regulars who come for grits and home fries , catfish and okra , smothered chicken and peach cobbler . Je 's after Sunday Mass is a sight , Newark all dressed up in finery and extended families marching straight from the hallelujah to the harvest . <P> " This was her pride and joy , " Harry says of his wife , Christmas decorations all around as he stands behind the counter in his white apron . And so it was , but there was a price for the success of Je 's . The same price we all pay when , in balancing a work life with a home life , work too often wins . " If you got a break for a minute on a Sunday , you 'd look out and see all these families together , " says Jason , 29 , who came after Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was hard to deal with sometimes , because we never got a chance to do that . We worked side by side , but that was n't the same as being together as a family . " The four Sutton men begged Mom to slow down , maybe close Je 's two days a week instead of just one , but she could n't stop . <P> " I 'm a sharecropper 's daughter , " she would tell Harry Sr. , and that said everything . Newark needed to be fed , so she catered free meals to charities , and if someone knocked at the back door hungry and penniless , she could n't say no . To the very end , that was Diane . " We were at home that night , and she had trouble breathing , " Harry says , eyes glistening . " She started coughing , and next thing , she was unconscious . " Chad performed CPR on his mother , 58 , who had no history of serious illness . Harry called 911 and kept pleading with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ca n't leave me like this ! " They were close to retirement , the house nearly paid for , the boys self-sufficient . Harry had this saying for himself : prepare to die and hope to live . But he was n't ready for Diane to go . " You just ca n't leave me like this ! "
