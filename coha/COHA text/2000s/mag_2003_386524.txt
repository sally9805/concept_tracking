Section : War on Terror Next Wave : Rumsfeld frets that radical Islamic schools are training a new army of jihadists-that ' the harder we work , the behinder we get . ' He 's right to worry <p> Abdul Bari 's school day begins at 4 a.m . The freckle-faced , outgoing 9-year-old , an Afghan poppy farmer 's son , wakes up on the tile floor he shares with four dozen other students at the Jamia Uloom Islamia religious academy , in the untamed mountains of Pakistan 's tribal areas . After morning prayer services , he fixes tea for the older boys and himself , eating a bit of bread before classes start at daybreak . Students spend most of the day reciting the Qur'an ; memorizing every one of its 6,666 verses is the main requirement for graduation . Still , this madrassa is the only formal schooling most of these boys will ever have . So they learn civics from a white-bearded scholar named Amanullah , 65 , who teaches them about the Taliban . " There was a real Islamic regime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of problems in no time , using Islamic laws . " <p> Another faculty member , Mullah Taj Mohammad , 40 , gives a current-events lesson , warning of the evils that lurk in non-Islamic lands : " I 've heard that many Muslim girls have infidel boyfriends  --  and clink glasses of alcohol with Jews . " That 's not the worst of it , he says : " Americans are killing Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq , and they are busy trying to poison Muslim minds everywhere with films , music and television . " Abdul is an eager learner . He dreams of enlisting in the jihad against Afghanistan 's U.S.-backed president , Hamid Karzai . " Karzai is a killer of Muslims , " the boy says . " When I grow up I 'll fight him , and then we 'll see who 's a man and who 's a woman . " <p> The Afghan war , code-named Operation Enduring Freedom , is getting nastier . In the last six months  --  the bloodiest period since the Taliban 's fall in late 2001  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians , including two foreign relief officials and nearly a dozen Afghans working for international agencies . Last week the United Nations announced that it was suspending its refugee-repatriation program and pulling all foreign workers out of southeastern Afghanistan . " We 're going to have to refight Enduring Freedom because we did n't finish the job , " predicts retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni , former head of U.S. Central Command . <p> Even among senior Bush aides , concern is rising over the mess that festered in Afghanistan while the White House fixated on Iraq . The war 's No. 1 target , Osama bin Laden , is still in business . His Taliban friends have regrouped and are doing their best to sabotage the reconstruction . Two weeks ago , in the old Taliban stronghold of Spin Buldak , a new audiotape was released , purportedly of the group 's leader , Mullah Mohammad Omar , rallying his followers . " If you claim to be among the faithful , why ca n't you be ready for sacrifice ? " the voice on the tape demands . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his , in the north Waziristan town of Mirali , are where many Taliban leaders got their start two decades ago during the CIA 's war against the Soviets in Afghanistan . Today , those jihad academies continue to indoctrinate new generations of holy warriors , passionately loyal to the banner of radical Islam and inured to lives of hardship . Such schools pose a grave challenge to the Bush administration 's plans for the region . " How do we stop those who are financing the radical madrassa schools ? " asked Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a recently leaked memo . " Is our current situation such that ' the harder we work , the behinder we get ? ' " More than a year ago Pakistan 's leader , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , promised to defang the madrassas . Instead , he formed a political alliance with the schools ' radical Islamist supporters against the mainstream secular opposition . " Musharraf talks a lot , but nothing happens , " says Maulana Abdul Qadr , principal of the Darul Uloom Zuberia madrassa , near Peshawar . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces went after six previously banned militant groups , closing down dozens of their affiliated madrassas and promising to deal harshly with any that tried to defy the order . Musharraf 's Interior minister , Faisal Saleh Hayat , announced that new regulations on religious schools will be issued this week , at the end of Ramadan . " There will be no compromise , " Hayat told NEWSWEEK before the announcement . " We are totally committed to madrassa reforms and will not be deterred by political expediency . " Nevertheless , Musharraf 's Islamist partners of convenience are threatening to organize street protests against him , and the country 's leading hard-line schools , such as the Darul Uloom Islamia in Karachi , swore to resist any moves to control them . <p> Musharraf 's job often seems hopeless . Not even the mullahs know how many madrassas Pakistan has . The government 's latest guess is 27,000 or more . Many are peaceable institutions wishing only to train devout Muslims , not warriors or terrorists . But others steep their students in the doctrine of holy war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration from older schoolmates . Zahidullah , 31 , a grad student in Islamic law at the Bahrul Uloom madrassa in Pakistan 's northern mountains , boasts of how many recruits he has gained for the outlawed Kashmiri guerrilla force Harkatul Mujahedin : " Many youths here are anxious to join the jihad when I tell them stories of our heroic Islamic resistance against Indian aggression . " <p> Some schools provide far more than recruitment services , providing safe havens , supply depots and clandestine meeting sites . Last summer , according to Pakistani intelligence sources , a group of senior Taliban leaders secretly gathered to discuss strategy at a madrassa some 20 miles south of Peshawar . The Afghans told their local contacts that Mullah Omar was calling for new recruits to intensify the war against America . In September Pakistani security forces raided another madrassa in Karachi , hauling in more than a dozen Indonesian and Malaysian students , including Rusman Gunawan , younger brother of the notorious Qaeda lieutenant Hambali . Gunawan remains in custody without charges under Pakistan 's antiterror laws . <p> In recent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just inside Pakistan . In Baluchistan 's Chaman district , directly across the border from the Taliban 's home province of Kandahar , at least 300 madrassas are filled to bursting . Pakistan 's Army has lined the desolate frontier with high earthen berms , concertina-wire fences and watchtowers , but nothing stops the traffic of fighting-age Afghans  --  in either direction . " There is a constant stream of them , " says Hafiz Hameedullah , head of a seminary in the town of Chaman , right on the border . " It 's hard to find accommodations for all the newcomers . " On the Afghan side , meanwhile , the influx of madrassa students and graduates has helped to produce Taliban battle units as large as 100 fighters , where a year ago the guerrillas were mustering squads of barely a half-dozen men . <p> Musharraf 's latest moves are n't likely to inconvenience the holy warriors much . His aides have said the new law will ban the teaching of sectarian hatred and violence . But mostly it lays out a program for the voluntary registration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to financial audits and accept a government-recommended curriculum that includes secular courses like English and computer science . Even many militant schools have begun offering those subjects already , to help their students find jobs after graduation . They still draw the line at letting their pupils use the Internet . " Weak students could look at pornography , " Qadr explains . <p> Any effort to combat radical teachings is complicated by the fact that Pakistan desperately needs its madrassas . Without them , an estimated 1.5 million young Pakistanis would get no formal education at all . According to a recent analysis by the U.S. Agency for International Development , Pakistan spends only 2.2 percent of its GDP on public education , the tiniest share for any country in South or Southeast Asia . And Pakistan 's jihadis are more than ready for a fight . " If Musharraf tries to crack down on madrassas , there will be a flood of blood in the streets , " says Maulana Anwar Ali Shah , principal of one of Pakistan 's biggest schools , the Jamia Islamia Taalemulqiran madrassa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West , is the blood that will be spilled if the madrassas keep on teaching violence and hate . Sitting below a poster of himself holding the Qur'an in his right hand and a Kalashnikov in his left , Samiul Haq says he fully supports what he calls " the real freedom fights " in Iraq , Afghanistan and Kashmir . He 's the principal of the Darul Uloom Haqqania mad-rassa , 20 miles east of Pesha-war , one of the biggest religious schools in Pakistan . He and his 3,000 students proudly call it " the University of Jihad . " Its alumni include at least eight senior Taliban leaders , and Mullah Omar sent a personal message to every graduating class until his regime 's collapse two years ago . Without a trace of irony , Haq denies that his school teaches extremism . " I challenge Musharraf to find any extremism here , " he says . " This madrassa is not a military base . It has no guns or tanks . " He adds : " We teach jihad because the holy Qur'an teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A NEWSWEEK reporter attended the school 's commencement ceremony a few weeks ago . About 1,000 white-turbaned graduates and thousands of relatives jammed the madrassa 's courtyard under banners depicting AK-47s and antiaircraft guns . The crowd seemed uncontrollable until Haq 's eldest son , Rashidul Haq , took the microphone and announced : " If you are a friend of Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar , please sit down . But if you are a friend of Bush , keep standing . " Everyone immediately sat , and a mullah delivered the invocation . " I request that almighty Allah protect the Taliban and our popular leaders Mullah Omar and Osama , " he prayed . " They are living in caves and suffering . We pray for their assistance and health . " <p> Ten miles closer to Peshawar , in the tiny village of Qumber Khen , tribesmen recently greeted a homecoming student with jubilant bursts of AK-47 fire in the air . Talawat Shah , 28 , was arriving from his graduation at the Darul Uloom Sapia madrassa , not far from the Khyber Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to Mullah Omar . " If we forget the jihad , God will forget us , " Shah said . " But if we return to jihad , God will lift us up . " His first priority is to start a madrassa in Qumber Khen . He 's eager to spread the message of jihad to his students . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : No alternative : The only education available for some 1.5 million Pakistanis <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Magnet district : A pro-Taliban gathering in Baluchistan province <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Repeating history : Bookstore and street scene in Peshawar , where holy war has been export No. 1 since the Soviets took Kabul <p> By Ron Moreau ; Sami Yousafzai and Zahid Hussain <p> with Michael Hirsh , in Washington <p>
