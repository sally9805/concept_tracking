<p> The Giants have no idea when , or if , closer Robb Nen will pitch again , but the balance of power probably has n't moved an inch in the National League West . What was supposed to be a three-team race among the Giants , Diamondbacks and Dodgers looks as if it will be a six-month victory parade for the Giants . <p> General manager Brian Sabean 's overhauled offense has some holes in it , but if the Giants were going to win it was going to be because they had more pitching than anyone else . <p> They do . <p> As for Nen , they 're crossing their fingers he 'll be able to pitch in 2004 after undergoing his third shoulder operation in seven months last week . Nen , 33 , is 11th on the all-time saves list with 314 . <p> " Make no mistake , " Giants trainer Stan Conte said . " This is a serious surgery and there are no guarantees . Is this career-threatening ? Absolutely . " <p> The Giants will have a different look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented bullpen that has helped them run up a lead in the NL West . Tim Worrell has converted 10 of 11 save chances , Felix Rodriguez and Joe Nathan have power arms and former starter Ryan Jensen is in the bullpen after being dropped from the rotation . <p> Lefthander Jason Christiansen , another power pitcher , should be off the disabled list in June . <p> Worrell , 35 , has the closer 's role . He has appeared in a team-high 19 games and at this pace would pitch in 93 to shatter his personal record of 80 established last season . <p> " You do n't replace a Robb Nen , " Worrell said . " That 's a big void in our bullpen . But we have a great team and a chance to do something . Everyone 's getting the job done . " <p> Nathan is the setup man , for now , but manager Felipe Alou has been impressed with his " stopper stuff . " Giants pitching coach Dave Righetti said : " Joe Nathan has been the glue of the bullpen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's been the first guy behind the starter more than anyone else . To me that 's the glue guy . " <p> Nathan , 28 , entered professional baseball as a shortstop and after taking a year off made a comeback as a pitcher . He was 7-4 in 1999 and 5-2 in 2000 before having shoulder surgery . <p> That procedure appeared to be the end of his career because he lost 10-12 mph off what had been a 94-mph fastball . He needed two years to get back to the majors , and this season he has been brilliant . <p> He allowed his first earned run of the season Thursday night in his 23rd inning on the mound . His ERA rocketed to 0.39 . <p> By the end of the summer he 'll give up a few more runs , but unless something dramatic happens , he 'll have some real fun next fall once the playoffs begin . <p> Few teams could lose a Nen and still feel so good about themselves . The Giants can because of a rotation that begins with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a combined 11-1 . With Rich Aurilia and Edgardo Alfonzo finally hitting , Barry Bonds might have a few more opportunities to swing the bat . And then there 's that deep and talented bullpen . <p> AROUND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE <p> Charity work - Eight Astros , including Geoff Blum and Jose Vizcaino , visited students at nine Houston-area elementary schools last week to promote volunteerism and community service . <p> Their work was for a charitable foundation - the Players Trust for Children - established by the Major League Baseball Players Association . It 's the first charitable foundation established and administered by players . <p> " Kids who help others develop a more positive self-esteem and a feeling of compassion for people in need , " said Astros catcher Gregg Zaun . <p> Ca n't Dodge it - With the Dodgers already seven games out , manager Jim Tracy 's job security has become an issue , at least in the media . The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Tracy might need to make the playoffs to keep his job . <p> Tracy is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high marks for his honesty , communication and game-day decisions . But the bottom line is winning . <p> " I do n't know how anyone could think Trace is the problem , " catcher Paul Lo Duca said . " We just have n't hit like we know we 're going to . We know the fans are frustrated , and we 're frustrated , too . But Trace is n't up there hitting for us , throwing it or fielding it . " <p> Cards ' pen not mightier - The Cardinals suddenly look vulnerable . Their bullpen has blown nine of 14 save chances without injured closer Jason Isringhausen , and in back-to-back games against the Reds last week , Dustin Hermanson and Kiko Calero surrendered game-losing home runs . <p> " It 's driving them nuts , " manager Tony La Russa said . <p> Lefthander Steve Kline admits his confidence is shot ; he has been removed from the closer 's role . Hermanson and Calero do n't appear to be the answer . <p> Unlike the Astros , who are getting so little from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his starters out . <p> Last season , the Cardinals got at least eight innings from their starters only 15 times . This season , he has left his starter out there for at least eight innings 12 times . <p> More than less - Speaking of burnout , there 's Expos righthander Javier Vazquez , who has thrown 120 or more pitches in three of his last five starts . <p> " I 'm conscious about it , " Vazquez said . " I know if I 'm not feeling good , or I think I 've had enough , I 'm going to tell them . " <p> Expos manager Frank Robinson says Vazquez has to learn to do more with less . <p> " He has outstanding stuff , some of the best stuff in baseball , in either league , " Robinson said . " I would like to have him make the hitter put the ball in play more , especially in certain situations . But he 's still gaining experience . He 's pretty darn good as it is . It 's hard to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Reds shuffle - The Reds swept a four-game series from the Cardinals last week , and their starting pitchers were John Riedling , Jeff Austin , Danny Graves and Paul Wilson . The first three entered this season with four career starts in the big leagues . <p> This is life with the Reds . They have n't developed enough starters and ca n't afford to buy them through free agency , so they shuffle longtime relievers into new roles until they find something that works . <p> Riedling made his first big-league start after 88 relief appearances Monday and allowed one run in 4 1/3 innings . Austin , a Kingwood native , allowed two runs in 6 1/3 innings Tuesday in his third big-league start . <p> Graves , a former closer , did the honors Wednesday by giving up two runs in 7 2/3 innings . <p> " These guys have done a great job , " Reds manager Bob Boone said . " We 've given them good plans , and the pitchers and catcher Jason LaRue have executed it really well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one player who understands how tough the newspaper business is . Sure , you 've got your coal miners and your truck drivers and all of that , but Suppan knows how to make a buck the hard way . <p> After his first season in the Red Sox farm system , he worked in the sports department of the Los Angeles Daily News . His duties included taking information about high school games over the phone . <p> And you thought listening to the local sports radio station was torture . <p> " I only lasted two weeks in that job , " he said . " It was a tough job . Coaches would call in , I 'd ask them how to spell their names and they would get mad that I did n't already know . There was just too much pressure . Pitching is a lot easier than that stuff . " <p> Yes , my friend , there are many stormy nights on the rough seas of journalism . Only the strong survive . <p> Looking smart now - The Braves have won 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be forced to admit they knew what they were doing last winter when they overhauled the rotation by letting Tom Glavine depart and trading Kevin Millwood . <p> " Everybody was saying , ' Finally the Braves are out of the race , ' " center fielder Andruw Jones said . " We said we 're going to prove everybody wrong . " <p> Manager Bobby Cox admits his lads have used so many different ways to win that even he is amazed . <p> " If I knew the answer to all this , we 'd never lose , " he said . <p> Mike Hampton added : " Not many teams can make the kind of changes every year like the ones they have and still come to the park every day expecting to win . " <p> No answers yet - The Rockies have lost 11 of their last 13 road games . Most of the games have been close and they have got a bunch of what-ifs , but they trailed the Giants by 8 1/2 games in the NL West . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , but now we have to turn the page and find a way to win games we should win , " outfielder Jay Payton said . <p> Wait ' til next year - The Padres are 12 games under .500 and 12 1/2 games out of first place . And they 're already planning for next season when they move into a new downtown ballpark . <p> That ballpark should give them a few extra dollars , and they 're whispering about making a run at an elite free agent , such as Miguel Tejada , Rich Aurilia or Japanese star Kazuo " Little Godzilla " Matsui . <p> AROUND THE AMERICAN LEAGUE <p> Have to bring it - After three straight losses in Toronto last week , Angels manager Mike Scioscia locked the doors and had a heated talk with his boys . They responded by winning three in a row against the Indians . <p> " If you get beat you get beat , but you need to bring your game every night , " Scioscia said . " We were n't able to control things the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , and Toronto kicked our butts . " <p> Thanks , but no thanks - Mariners manager Bob Melvin went to the hospital Wednesday to have surgery on his right elbow . As he was filling out paperwork , he stopped , got up and left the hospital . <p> It 's the second time he has put off surgery doctors have told him is needed to remove loose particles in his right elbow . But it 's the first time he got as far as the hospital . <p> Unless he has it , his days of throwing batting practice are over . <p> Sox exchange - The White Sox have lost 13 of 19 , and manager Jerry Manuel is trying a bit of everything , including moving Frank Thomas to second in the batting order . <p> " We 're desperate , man , " Manuel said . " We 'll go for anything . We 'll lead him off if it takes that . " <p> Thomas was hitting .226 at the time of the move . <p> " We 're struggling bad , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody knows that . No one wants to fail , and we 've been failing bad . But it 's not going to go away by thinking about it . You have to relax yourself and go up and relax a little more . Stressing over it and talking about it every day is not going to help . It will break when it breaks . That 's the way hitting goes . " <p> Manuel made one other move . He removed Billy Koch from the closer 's role . After being removed from a game in the ninth inning last week , Koch flung his glove into the stands . <p> For the season , he has allowed 20 hits and six walks in 15 innings . Damaso Marte is the new closer . <p> Pitching smart - Mike Mussina is baseball 's best pitcher at the moment . He 's 7-0 , has pitched fewer than seven innings just one and has allowed more than two earned runs once . <p> " I 've been pitching smart . I 've been pitching with conviction , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a fun ride , and I 'd like to keep it going for as long as I can . " <p> The only other Yankees pitcher to open a season with seven straight victories was Bob Turley , who did it in 1958 . <p> Rocking Rocco - The Devil Rays believe Rocco Baldelli 's 40 hits through April are the most ever for a rookie . They 're certain it 's the most since 1912 but could not check records before that . <p> " What a month he has had , " Rays manager Lou Piniella said . " He 's a player . He really is . He makes adjustments . He 's intelligent . He has had a heck of a month . He should be very proud of what he has accomplished . " <p> Bouncing back - Steve Avery , one of the game 's real good guys , is back in the big leagues for the first time since 1999 . The Tigers summoned him from the minors last week when struggling Matt Anderson was demoted . <p> " This is pretty special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the spring , I realized I missed more than I thought I did . I think I pitched well at Toledo . I dropped my arm angle there and picked up a little more movement . I 'm ready for this . " <p> Here 's one comet Alou can do without <p> Giants manager Felipe Alou says he holds no grudges against Jeffrey Loria , the former Expos owner who fired him in May 2001 . But Loria , who now owns the Florida Marlins , has given Alou a lot of conversational material . <p> " To me , " Alou said , " Jeffrey Loria is like a comet that goes by every 600 years . I hope I never see him again . He showed me he does n't care about me . " <p> Alou loves to tell the story of the time Loria suggested changing the team 's luck by moving the lineup card to a different spot in the dugout after every inning . <p> One thing he does n't laugh about is how he learned of his dismissal - not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words provide fuel for Rocket <p> Before Barry Zito beat Roger Clemens last weekend , A 's first baseman Scott Hatteberg used an unfortunate choice of words . <p> " Those are special games , and they 're even more magnified here , " he said . " It will be a great battle - Cy Young vs . Cy Old . " <p> Uh oh . <p> That phrase - Cy Young vs . Cy Old - was played prominently in the New York Post the next day . <p> Hatteberg arrived at Yankee Stadium to find the article taped to his locker . Inside the locker was a set of catcher 's gear . The message : Insult the great Clemens at your own risk . <p> But if Clemens knew about the headline , he did n't show it . At least , he did n't buzz Hatteberg when he came to bat in the first inning . Instead , Hatteberg homered . <p> " It was funny , " A 's outfielder Eric Byrnes said . " When he got back to the dugout , someone asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they said , ' Is he throwing old hard or young hard ?
