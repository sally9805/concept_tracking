<p> THEY 'RE ROLLING the dice in Seattle , while Texas tries to calm a clubhouse storm . The A 's division has been a relatively dull place in recent years , but this week 's events will have a direct result on how Oakland fares down the stretch . <p> The Mariners pulled the trigger on Rickey Henderson , and when you think about it , they do n't have much to lose . Stan Javier was the left fielder , and he has always been more valuable off the bench . Mark McLemore ( yawn ) and Mike Cameron were leading off . They ca n't help but improve with Henderson on board , and we all know Rickey : In a new setting , with a point to prove and some statistics to rack up , he could be dynamite over the short haul . The division is wide open , and an energized Henderson could put Seattle over the top . <p> Meanwhile , the Royce Clayton-Chad Curtis incident makes you want to write off the Rangers altogether . They were a suspect team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over an incredibly petty feud . <p> Curtis is the kind of guy who takes life head-on , whether it 's breaking up the double play , turning on a fastball or brow-beating people with his religious beliefs . He once argued with teammate Kevin Mitchell and found himself getting slammed into a Ping-Pong table . He 's the guy who belittled Derek Jeter in the Yankee dugout last year after Jeter , in Curtis ' opinion , got a little too friendly with Alex Rodriguez during a bench-clearing brawl . <p> Now the target is Clayton , who irritated Curtis by playing rap music in the clubhouse . Curtis , who describes himself as a " Bible-believing Christian , " told Clayton the music 's graphic language was inappropriate , especially when children happened to be hanging around . <p> The two of them should have settled this internally , but Clayton made the clueless decision to take it onto a Web page ( www.athletesdirect.com ) . Under the title , " The Demise of Our Ballclub , " Clayton ridiculed Curtis as " someone who hit one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie Mays . " Mentioning the Ping-Pong incident , Clayton wrote , " Is that why rap music makes you angry ? Does it remind you of being smacked around by former teammates ? " He said team morale has been destroyed " all due to one person , " and added , " Just check the back of his baseball card , and it will let you know just how important he is to any team . " <p> Several Texas players sided with Clayton . Others , including born-again Christian John Wetteland , took Curtis ' side and pointed out his greatest asset to a ballclub : sheer hustle . Clayton and Curtis had a peacemaking confrontation , smoothing things over for the moment , but the residue has made this clubhouse the laughingstock of baseball . <p> We should mention the AL West 's other team , the Anaheim Angels , while we 're at it . Nothing much new down there . They still have a fake mountain range in center field , and you 'll want to watch out for the fake bobcats . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The NBA Finals are this afternoon . Seventh game . Might as well be , for the importance this one carries . If the Lakers use their home-court advantage to humble the Trail Blazers , count on that happening every time at Staples Center . This may not be vintage Showtime , in the Magic-Worthy-Kareem sense , but the Lakers play the front-running game better than anyone . A Portland win could change everything . . . We like the Lakers because Rasheed Wallace is too combustible and Arvydas Sabonis , even with help , does n't have a prayer against Shaq . And Kobe Bryant will rise above mere mortals . . . Watch for Phil Jackson to play some sort of mind game with Scottie Pippen , who is n't a leader and never has been . . . What a sorry exit for Jason Kidd , dribbling the ball out of bounds with no defensive pressure and generally looking invisible in the Suns ' last game against L.A. At least Kidd realizes the absurdity of his new hairstyle , saying he wo n't try that again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Let 's hope Jason Williams follows Kidd 's lead and grows his hair back . He spent the season looking like a dope , somebody who would make the wrong decision at crunch time  --  which is exactly his reputation . . . Jeff Hornacek retired , and he took a lot of the old NBA with him . Once there were many players like Hornacek , pure shooters like Freddie Brown , Flynn Robinson , Brian Winters and Jon McGlocklin . Today , the horribly flawed Glen Rice gets deified because he buries a few outside jumpers . . . For pure creativity and imagination , Hornacek was a George Gervin-like presence out there . And no regrets , even though Hornacek did n't get a ring . Did you see the smile on his face as he held his young daughter at the press conference ? That 's a man ready to rejoin his family . . . Total joke : The controversy over Anthony Carter 's game-winning shot for Miami in Game 3 against the Knicks . The whole thing was reminiscent of Franco Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ( an offensive man ca n't tip a ball to a teammate ) was dead wrong , and later changed . Except this time it was two dumb rules . Why is n't it OK to shoot one over the backboard ? Sometimes that 's the only choice . Larry Bird did it one time , as he was falling out of bounds , and the refs whistled off one of the most mind-blowing shots in NBA history . The other travesty is offensive goal-tending . That rule was instituted because a number of players in the ' 60s , notably Gene Wiley , were guiding errant shots into the basket in mid-flight . Once the ball hits the rim , what 's wrong with a player tipping it in ? He got there through hard work and positioning . Nothing else should matter , including the " cylinder " . . . Great move by Michigan State coach Tom Izzo , blowing off Atlanta to stay at Michigan State . You ca n't trust a franchise that takes on J. R. Rider , then defends the decision ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Best number of the Warriors ' season : $7.50 , the amount chopped off certain season tickets on the lower level . But why stop there ? All of the prices should come down . . . David Stern says the NBA will come right back with its forever-between-games schedule in the first playoff round next season , because the TV figures proved him right . How ? NBC 's ratings are down 21 percent . The guy ca n't even admit a blatant mistake . . . Another insane move by the NBA : Embarrassed by the many tattoos , earrings and necklaces decorating Allen Iverson 's body , they simply airbrushed them out of Iverson 's photograph in Hoop Magazine , the league 's official publication . Think about that . Consider the brand of paranoia that yields such a decision . Said Seattle Times columnist Art Thiel , " It 's amazing they did n't ink in his cornrows . " . . . Speaking of paranoia , Major League Baseball has banned the press from its tour of the baseball-production factory in Costa Rica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . . . Something about the Coliseum seems fresh and different this year . Must be the removal of the two enormous Keith Olbermann heads ( FOX advertising ) in the outfield . . . What the A 's concessionaires call the Big Dog  --  appearing to be nearly two feet long  --  is a marvel to behold . Sadly , it meets the same fate as so many Coliseum hot dogs : Not grilled . . . Finally found something more tedious than the last two minutes of an NBA playoff game ( Time out ! Free throws ! Time out ! Another time out ! Free throws ! Time out ! ) , and that 's the wishy-washy Steve Young as he weighs his future . The old Steve Young , the guy who swept around left end without a helmet , would have figured it out by now . Instead , he leaves the whole world hanging , to the point where nobody really cares . <p> Bruce Jenkins can be reached via e-mail at jenks@sfgate.com.
