Dear Dr. Cory : I have dry skin . I 've had It my whole life . I ca n't seem to get rid of It . I use lotion everyday . Sometimes I even use oils . Why do people even get dry skin ? Can you give me some advice ? Crystal Dillard Buford , Georgia Dear Crystal : Dry skin is made of dead skin cells that can no longer hold their moisture . This can be due to decreased humidity in the air , irritating elements such as harsh soaps , or certain skin conditions like eczema . Heated or air-conditioned inside air make it easy for skin to loose its moisture and become dry and itchy . To help heal dry or chapped skin , lubricants  --  like petroleum jelly-used several times a day , can feel soothing to the skin . To help prevent dry skin : * Bathe only as needed . Frequent baths can further dry your skin . During winter months you may only need to bathe three or four times a week . * When bathing , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause dry skin ( although they are good at rinsing away perspiration oils in the summer ) . * Use warm water instead of hot water . * Limit bath time to ten minutes or less . * Gently pat your skin dry with a cotton towel . Vigorous rubbing can irritate dry skin . * After bathing , while the skin is still damp , apply a moisturizing cream or lotion . * Dress in layers of thin , cotton clothing to seal in your own humidity . * Use a humidifier in your home , but to prevent mold from growing , be sure to follow manufacturer 's cleaning instructions . * Use a sunscreen year round to protect the skin from the sun 's damaging UV rays . * If you continue to have dry skin that flakes and sometimes cracks , you may have an underlying skin condition that requires evaluation by a dermatologist ( skin doctor ) . Dear Dr. Cory : Is It true that the sun hurts your skin during a sunburn ? Katie Wilkinson Makal , Oahu Dear Katie : Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells . Sunburns commonly cause two types of burns : * First-degree burn occurs when the first layer of skin , the epidermis , has been burned but not burned through . The skin becomes dry and pink . There are no blisters and only minor pain . Healing time usually takes three to five days with peeling but no scarring . The dead skin cells flake off , showing the layer of new skin cells underneath . * Second-degree burns are more serious burns . They occur when the first layer of skin has been burned and the second layer , the dermis , has also been burned . The dermis contains the nerve endings . When they are injured the amount of pain greatly increases . Seconddegree burns result in the skin blistering and the amount of redness and swelling also increases . Whether you get a sunburn or a suntan , you are exposed to the sun 's ultraviolet ( UV ) rays . These rays are invisible to the human eye , but they are there on cloudy as well as sunny days . Damage occurs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays during everyday activities such as swimming , walking , bike riding , and other outdoor sports . Half of a person 's lifetime UV radiation exposure occurs before age twenty . Studies continue to suggest that sun exposure early in life causes skin cancer as an adult . See you next issue !
