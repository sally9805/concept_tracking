You ca n't bear the thought of drilling holes in your walls and snaking cables around the house . Here 's the good news : you do n't have to . You can go wireless . <P> More and more consumers are doing it ; sales of wireless home-networking products in 2001 were 12 times what they were the year before , according to Stephen Baker , director of research for NPD Techworld . And it 's easy to see why .

If you 're buying a new notebook , most major PC manufacturers will sell you one with Wi-Fi capabilities built in . <P> STEP 2 Install and Configure <P> Wi-Fi routers and network cards come with software to walk you through the installation . The steps will vary slightly , depending on each computer 's operating system . The older the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed to detect and configure a PC card to talk to an existing network , and getting an iBook running Mac OS X to communicate with my Linksys router was a breeze .
