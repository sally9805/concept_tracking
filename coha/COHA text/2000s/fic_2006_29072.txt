Frogs &; French Kisses By Sarah Mlynowski Random House Sarah Mlynowski My Love Life Is Up in the Air ( and So Am I ) 1 I 'm perched on a floating broom , my arms squeezing the life out of my little sister 's waist . " You girls all right ? " my mom calls down . She 's watching us from behind the second-story cottage window . " You 're not airsick ? Maybe I should n't have let you talk me into this . " " I 'm fine , " Miri chirps . " Me too , " I lie as the two of us wobble up and down like we 're on a haunted seesaw . We 're straddling a plastic broom four feet above the dewy ground . In what deranged world would I be fine ? My eyes are cemented closed , I 'm biting my lip , and every one of my muscles is clenched in fear . " I do n't want you girls gone for more than an hour , " my mom warns . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the window open so you can fly straight back in . If you think anyone has spotted you , return here immediately . And , Rachel , do n't you dare take off that helmet ! " How does she know my secret plan ? " But it 's itchy ! " " She wo n't . " Miri pats my knee . " You ready ? Here we go ! " Nausea and dizziness wash over me . Maybe this is n't such a brilliant idea . My legs are dangling like a rag doll 's , and the broom is starting to chafe . " Do n't go too fast , " I plead in a super-high-pitched voice , like I just inhaled a balloon full of helium . " And do n't go too high . We do n't want to smash into an airplane . And don't- " The broom jerks forward , I swallow a scream , and suddenly we 're flying through upstate New York . " Be careful ! " my mom hollers in the background . I 'm flying . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I may be dreading going back to school , but at least I 'm flying high during spring break . Literally . I gingerly open my right eye as we shoot past the gate to our rented cottage and zoom over the dirt road . The wind caresses my cheeks , my arms , my hair . . . . I think the wind just blew a leaf up my nose . But who cares ? How cool is this ? Do n't look down , do n't look down ! I look down . My shoelaces are hanging over the sides of my new pink sneakers like floppy dog ears . I really should have double knotted . These are the new pink sneakers that my mom bought to cheer me up . To make a long , heartbreaking story short , I spent the first few days of vacation moping because Raf Kosravi , the love of my life , hates me because I ( unintentionally ) stood him up for the Spring Fling to go to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mom . She 's definitely trying to be more understanding . On the same night she surprised me with the cheer-up present , she dropped her slice of pepperofu ( vile , flavorless , pepperoni-shaped slabs of tofu ) pizza and announced , " Miri , banning you from using witchcraft is n't working . If you 're going to do it anyway , as you 've been doing for the last two months , I want to teach you to use magic responsibly . The three of us are going on a trip . Start packing . " My jaw fell open in midchew . Mom was finally seeing the light ! See , I 've only just recently discovered that my mom 's a witch . My sister , too . Everyone 's a witch except me . Well , not my dad or any of my friends . But everyone I live with . And my mom had a very strict rule : absolutely no magic until Miri finishes her training . My mom is antimagic herself , preferring to be a nonpracticing witch . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! " I cheered while debating what to pack . Going-out clothes or **39;1138;TOOLONG sweats ? I did n't mind leaving the city , mostly because my best and now only friend ( yes , her mom is married to a woman ) , Tammy , is spending spring break in the Gulf of Mexico with her mom and stepmom ( since I embarrassed myself phenomenally at the school fashion show ) . " Magic for everyone ! Can we put a love spell on Raf ? " " Do n't push your luck " was my mom 's response . " Love spells are not what I consider responsible . " What is the point of having a witch for a mom if she wo n't perform one measly love spell on the boy of my dreams ? If only she were more like a friend and less like a mother . Anyway , the next morning we left extra food for Tigger , our cat , and Goldie , our goldfish , rented a car , and drove from our cozy downtown Manhattan apartment to a rented cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have no nosy neighbors to witness our shenanigans . We arrived on Wednesday night , two entire days ago . Forty-eight hours in a two-bedroom cottage that smells like a mixture of mothballs and apples . Forty-eight hours of no cable . No DVDs . No Internet . I 've had nothing to do except watch while my mom trains Miri , which surprisingly is n't that much fun . Fine , it 's semifun . At least my mom is finally letting Miri perform practical magic instead of just making her recite the history of witchcraft . But watching Miri attempt to levitate inanimate objects gets old fast . The peach-colored coffee mug 's hovering three inches above the kitchen table is unbelievable . Four inches is awesome . Five is funky . Six . . . yawn . After two days , rising kitchen dishware gets a wee bit repetitive . Actually , downright sleep inducing . It was n't until this afternoon , while my mom was showing Miri how to float a paper towel , that it occurred to me that if Miri could make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I found the broom in the hallway closet . It was old and scraggly , and some of the bristles were bent at odd ninety-degree angles , but it would do the trick . " Is there any truth to the witches-flying-on-brooms legend ? " I asked , yanking it out , causing a dustbin to fall on my head . " Well . . . " My mom hesitated . " No . " I did n't buy it . If a paper towel could levitate , why could n't a broom ? I walked over to her and looked deep into her green eyes . " Do you swear ? " Instead of answering , she ran her bitten fingernails through her shoulder-length bottle-blond hair and shrugged . " What ? " Miri cried , jumping out of her chair and causing the paper towel to float back down to the table . Good thing she 'd raised glasses the day before . " You told me flying brooms were a myth ! " " I know . " My mom took a moment to bite her thumbnail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I was worried about you . I did n't want you flying around Manhattan , bumping into the Empire State Building . " I clapped with gleeful excitement . From now on I 'd travel in style . Sweaty overcrowded subways ? Never again . Running late to school ? I do n't think so . The only road I 'm taking is Highway Broom . " Teach me how ! " I shrieked . " You mean teach me , " Miri said snidely . " If I 'd known I was going to teach you to fly , I would have brought cigarettes , " my mom said . " You promised to quit ! " I muttered . " I know , I know . I quit , all right ? It 's just that letting you fly is going to be stressful . " She bit her thumbnail again . " I 'll teach you , but you have to promise- " Be careful , go slow , stay low , whatever , yes , yes , yes ! " - to wear your bike helmets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cool as flying look geeky .
