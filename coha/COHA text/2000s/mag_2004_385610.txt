Section : INCOMING &gt;&gt; TARANTINO It 's been six years since Quentin Tarantino made a movie . But he can still have any woman he wants <p> QUENTIN TARANTINO LIVES IN THE sort of house you buy in Los Angeles the first time you make it big . It 's just off Mulholland Drive , atop the Hollywood Hills , a Spanish fantasy with turrets and porticoes . Like the car parked in the driveway , a beat-up Volvo , it 's modest by local standards - comfortable , but not so lavish that you 'd have to sell it and move out if you never make it again in Hollywood . Which has , of course , been the big question with Tarantino since his breakout with Pulp Fiction in the mid-Nineties . <p> He answers his door one evening a little before ten for the interview his publicists have put off a dozen times in recent weeks , suggestive of the post-production chaos surrounding Kill Bill Vol . I , the first new Tarantino film in six years . This kung-fu revenge epic stars Uma Thurman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to battle it out with an underworld boss played by Lucy Liu . It was , by most accounts , a mother-fucker to edit and turn into a releasable picture . After seven months of shooting in China and California , Tarantino was forced to chop what had been one Kill Bill film into two . <p> If there has been trouble with the project , Tarantino displays no hint of the stress when he greets me with a casual handshake and an invitation to join him in his private movie theater . Dressed in a brown velour tracksuit and slippers , Tarantino stands more than six feet tall , with broad shoulders and that prominent chin jutting out like the end of a two-by-four . But his hyperactive mannerisms - the rapid-fire speech and pretzel-twisting arm gesticulations - make him seem smaller than he is and vulnerable , like the class spaz who fends off the bullies through the sheer strength of his utter weirdness . <p> After his first flush of fame , Tarantino enjoyed a type of celebrity that was more rock star than director . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talk among his friends of Tarantino 's heavy dope smoking , even his more recent boasts of zooming on Chinese Ecstasy while in Beijing shooting Kill Bill - could not mask the fact that he was , at his core , the ultimate film dweeb , a one-time video-store clerk who could spend hours on some geeked-out rant about the relative virtues of chop-socky movie tracks and their influences on spaghetti westerns . <p> Now forty and graying at the temples , he admits to never having played a video game . He did n't really pay much attention to the war in Iraq - though he did like it when he heard that when U.S. soldiers took Saddam 's palace , they found a copy of Pulp Fiction there . Tarantino , however , is intensely aware of what the Kill Bills represent to his career . They are an ambitious effort to reconnect with audiences after 1997 's unenthusiastically received Jackie Brown and his disastrous run shortly thereafter , acting in the Broadway play Wait Until Dark . <p> " This is a really groovy theater , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overstuffed couch . Our talk lasts about three hours . The whole time , Tarantino practically appears to be swimming . His arms and legs flail in opposite directions , knocking over the stacks of DVDs piled up everywhere . He climbs up the back of the couch , perches there for a while , then climbs back down to the floor . When he actually brings himself to sit in one place , he 's often rocking back and forth . " My imagination built this theater , " he blurts at one point . " I took my imagination , I grabbed a piece of paper , and that 's where it all came from ; that 's where it all started . Me dreaming up stories bought all this . " <p> It 's been six years since you came out with a movie . The pressure must be on . <p> Well , it 's like when people say " pressure , " it usually has some kind of negative connotation . If there 's pressure , it 's the pressure I put on myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Pulp Fiction . Kill Bill is an audience movie . It 's meant to blow the audience away . I meant it to be like a concert , to get the whole house rocking . <p> Uma Thurman really carries the movie . How closely did you work with her on this ? <p> We had a total partnership on this movie . I wrote the script by myself , but we talked about it all the time . I pretty much moved to New York to be close to her . I 'd go up to her place in Woodstock and hang out there and write . We were talking a while ago , and she was like , " I do n't understand why I am different in your movies . I guess the other directors I work with do n't know me as well as you do , or . . . " She did n't use the word know . She used the word understand : " You understand me . " <p> There 's a story going around - probably totally unfounded - that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her husband , Ethan Hawke , but since you mentioned her being your muse and inspiration and all that , I have to ask , is this true ? <p> Really ? No . There is nothing to that . <p> That rumor is probably just a tribute to how well you captured her . There are some moments - where you go in close on her face - she just looks totally in heat . <p> I 'm always looking for that little flash in the eye , that tremble in the throat . Part of my job as a director is to know good acting when I see it . I take it really seriously with all the actors . I edit Michael Madsen like he 's a woman I 'm in love with . By the time you see the movie , all those mannerisms in my actors have been not only approved by me but cherished by me . <p> In " Kill Bill " there 's a point when Uma is talking about not being able to move her legs , and she says they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say they 'd " atrophied " ? Was that a mistake ? <p> I thought of changing it , but , you know Uma pronounces words in her own way That 's how she said it . I decided to keep it <p> How we know you 're having an affair with her . <p> Laughs <p> You grew up in Los Angeles , the South Bay area , but none of your movies have any traditional California feel - like surfing or skate-boarding . How did you end up missing those influences ? <p> I avoided that stuff , because I did n't really grow up in the beach areas of Soutt Bay . I grew up in the inland ghettoish parts . I hung out more with black kids and Mexican kids than white kids . In the Seventies , when I was in elementary school and going into junior high , white kids defined themselves by surfing and skate-boarding and all that . And I lived not to be associated with that group . I did n't weal OPs . I did n't wear puka shells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white boys were listening to Kiss , I was listening to Parliament . <p> Tour movies are known for the way you use music . Was music important to you at a child ? <p> When I was a little kid , I was mostly involved in Top Forty stuff . The first record I bought was the Partridge Family . I still listen to their records . I actually think David Cassidy is one of the most underrated vocal performers in the history of rock &; roll . Because I was growing up right at the same time when soul music was really coming completely into its own , I was hearing that all around the house all the time . But the music that made me make a left turn , after being Mr. Soul Boy for a long time , was when I got together with my first real love-of-my-life girlfriend . And she was a big Bob Dylan fan . Then all of a sudden I thought , " I want to be to film what Bob Dylan was to music . " Bob Dylan kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium . That 's what I 'm after . I do n't know if I 'm going to do it . I do n't know if I 'm going to get there with it , but that 's the goal . <p> How has movie culture changed since " Pulp Fiction " ? <p> You know , I ca n't really tell you how it changed , other than in one aspect . The violence that was in Reservoir Dogs and True Romance was considered at the time to be the thing that kept the movies from having mainstream appeal . Now , I love violent movies . I have no more problem saying that than somebody else saying , " I love musicals . " But the violence was considered the thing that kept Reservoir Dogs in its own little box . By the time Pulp Fiction came out , my audience had caught up with me in terms of the violence and my sense of humor . But initially I got all kinds of shit about the violence in Pulp Fiction , but I do n't really remember David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through when he made Seven . And I think part of the reason is , he was walking down a trail I blazed . <p> What do you not like about movies today ? <p> There have been all these bloodless battle action sequences in movies of the last six years . Both of the two Star Wars movies had big battles , but they were always fighting a robot , so it 's safe , it 's OK . Even the Lord of the Rings movies , which I really like , had you all set up for this giant battle at the end of The Two Towers . The lead-up to it was great , but the battle was n't that special . It was these flesh-and-blood characters fighting skeletons with glowing eyes and robes . Same thing with Pirates of the Caribbean . Same thing with the Matrix movies . <p> Ultimately , they 're just a bunch of computer people fighting computer chips . <p> In " Kill Bill , " much of the heat comes from watching your women characters beat the crap out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's really exciting . <p> Yeah . Watching Uma fight Vivica A. Fox 's character , that 's hot . When you see two beautiful women , and they 're hurting each other - punching each other in the face , bashing each other 's head against walls , slicing each other 's hands - that hurts , more than with two guys . There 's just a naughty aspect to seeing women fight . <p> You mean naughty-good ? <p> Having what you think is the wrong response to what you 're seeing is very sexy and exciting - in music , comedy , literature or films . Hands down . You know , there 's a special charge . <p> Do you ever have moments after you 've written especially twisted material where you 're alone in the dark thinking , " Oh , my God , if people see this stuff , they 're going to think something is horribly wrong with me " ? <p> I have moments of fear because I think what I do is too revealing about myself . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarantino figure running around in my movies , but I have to write from a place of personal experience in one degree or another . Part of my job as a writer is to just tell the truth as I perceive it , to tell my secrets without letting you know that I 'm telling them . <p> What is it in this ass-kicking female kung-fu film that 's deeply personal ? <p> There 's a subtext that has to do with me and where I was when I wrote it , and what I had to get out of my system or get into my system . But I do n't really want people to be following that score card . <p> Is there anything that sticks out in the Tarantino legend as just bullshit ? <p> No , I 'm impressed by the legend , because it is the truth . I mean , when it happened with Pulp Fiction , my friends were like , " Jesus ! Get the fuck out of here ! This is like the American fucking dream . " It 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the only truly gigantic business that is still kind of run like the Yukon . No one cares if you 're poor or where you came from . That 's pretty terrific . And that 's America . <p> There must have been a real reversal between dating women when you went from Quentin Tarantino the video-store clerk to Tarantino , director of " Pulp Fiction . " <p> Yeah , I do n't really think of any woman right now who 's unattainable . When you first become really successful , there is always going to be a little bit , whether you were a nerd or not , of Revenge of the Nerds - where you 're just like , " Yeah , baby ! " <p> Right . So after " Pulp Fiction , " you just went crazy , after being snubbed or whatever during all your loser days working at the video store . That must have felt great . <p> It was n't so much like revenge for girls who had snubbed me . It was more just like how some of my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " Wow ! I wish this guy and this guy and this guy could see me right now . That would be really fuckin ' cool . " <p> How much can you get away with because of money and fame ? <p> I really try to live in the real world . But I 'm lucky enough , because I can kind of create my world inside the real world . Go by my own set of rules . Basically , I do n't have to do shit I do n't want to do . But even before , when I was in school and I had no power at all , I was going to do what I was going to do . And if the authority and the powers that be were not going to be flexible , then I 'd just check out : " Fuck you . All right ? I do n't want to play your way . " Now that I 'm a successful director and I have power , it 's still the same way . <p> A lot of guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up busing trays for a living or reporting to their probation officers . When you were living in South Bay working those minimum-wage jobs , did you ever think you might end up just being a loser ? <p> The answer is yes and no . I legitimately lived most of my twenties without having a nickel to my fucking name . But at the same time , I believed I was an artist , so it was really only a matter of time . When I was flat on my ass , I started trying to write a novel . I spent about six months on it . And at a certain point I go , " You know , I do n't want to finish this . If I finish this , it would be a good-book . But then I would n't be a filmmaker . I 'd be a novelist trying to be a filmmaker . " Now , at that time , I was working at a video store making $10,000 a year . Would n't being a novelist be a hell of a lot better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did n't want to break my focus . <p> Was there any part of that life - being that unknown guy at the video store - that was better than your life today ? <p> No . It was a very important part of my life . I had a group of friends , and we did all of our shit together , we went out to movies together , one of my girlfriends came from the store . It was like all the shit you do when you 're in college with your college buddies , only if you 're poor and you ca n't go to college . That experience and time was absolutely , positively wonderful . Would I want to go back to it ? No , because I 'm an artist and I was n't really fulfilled . <p> Was there a moment when you knew you were breaking out of it ? <p> It was kind of like on my twenty-fifth birthday or something , I just had one of these weird little Tarantino detests-fests where I gave myself no credit for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens every two years or so . I made all these resolutions . And one of them was getting the fuck out of the South Bay and getting to Hollywood . It was surprising how relatively quickly it happened . If people were finding my early work explosive to one degree or another , I think that 's one of the reasons it was explosive . Because I 'd had to wait so long , when I finally got a chance to make movies , it just went snap ! <p> What made your spring snap with " Kill Bill " ? Was it the six-year wait ! <p> This was my first action movie . And I 've always adored action filmmakers . And those are actually what I consider the real cinematic directors . And so if I 'm going to throw my hat in that ring , I want to be one of the best that ever lived . I do n't want to do an OK job . I want to rock everybody 's fucking world . I kept watching the Apocalypse Now " Ride of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my fight sequences to be as good as that . " And it has to be that way . And if it 's not pounding the table , I 'm not as good as I think I am . All right ? And so there was a gigantic challenge to myself . It was like , " Am I the director that I want to be ? " Or do you just dc what you 've done before , because that was just fine ? " You write really good dialogue . Stick with that , buddy . But stay out of those guys ' park , because ultimately you ca n't cut it . " So there was an aspect of actually ... I have an expression that I call " hitting your head on the ceiling of your talent " punching his fist into his palm . I wanted to find out where that ceiling was for me . I actually wanted to risk failing . <p> Have you ever been on Prozac or drugs like Ritalin ? <p> They wanted to put me on something when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My first-grade teacher said to my mom something to the effect of , " Quentin 's just too much to handle . " My mom said , " I believe Quentin can be a handful , but if Quentin has hyperactive problems , that 's a problem he 's going to have for the rest of his life . He 's going to have to learn to deal with it . " <p> Aside from sheer violence , is There any one quality you see as vital to your movies ? <p> I equate movies , in a visceral kind of way , to either sex or drugs . You 're getting high . Or you 're being turned on . I 'm not really a guy who 's especially trying to get one big idea across . I 'm not Oliver Stone . I 'm not a big-idea kind of guy . I mean , I love some of his movies , but it 's just like he 's always banging on one fucking idea . If a million people see it , a million people come out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I love how Oliver Stone in interviews will just say anything that comes into his mind . He does n't seem to give a fuck what people think of him . <p> I 've been to these big Hollywood parties and he was , like , all fucked up . And it 's just like , " Good for him , man . " It 's good to see a big old Hollywood fucking guy just kind of let it all hang out . I sat with him . I was trying to catch up . And he 's not just doing this in some sleazy bar with a. bunch of rock &; roll fucks , man . He 's at the New Line Christmas party , and he 's , like , gettin ' sloppy laughs . That 's fuckin ' cool ! <p> I always like it when I hear about some movie star going out of control , getting caught with his pants down or whatever . That 's how Hollywood should be . <p> I concur . I 'm all into getting sloppy and getting blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you thinly creative risk-taking is missing in Hollywood ? <p> Risk in one form or another is all a part and parcel of art . You 've got to risk something . I actually think that 's what robs the vitality of a lot of the major auteur directors . I 've watched the movie brats of the Seventies go gray and get lethargic . <p> Like who ? <p> You know who they are . They make one film every year or year and a half . And , like , usually you watch those audiences get smaller and smaller and smaller . <p> Which directors do you think have avoided that trap ? <p> Almost none , as far as I 'm concerned . One of them was Stanley Kubrick . And I 'm not even the hugest Kubrick fan . But his shit did n't get old . And I think the reason he was so vital was because he did n't make a movie every two years . He made them when they mattered to him . That 's the problem I see with directors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pretty fuckin ' rock &; roll . And then you have the second twenty years , when they 're making excuses , making a lot of apologies for a lot of their work . And I never want that . I want the movies I do at the end of my life to be as good as the movies I did at the beginning of my life . <p> Has 9/11 or the war on terror had any impact on you personally or creatively ? <p> 9/11 did n't affect me , because there 's , like , a Hong Kong movie that came out called Purple Storm and it 's fantastic , a great action movie . And they work in a whole big thing in the plot that they blow up a giant skyscraper . It was done before 9/11 , but the shot almost is a semiduplicate shot of 9/11 . I actually enjoyed inviting people over to watch the movie and not telling them about it . I shocked the shit out of them . But , again , I was almost thrilled by that naughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting . <p> But on some level you must have been caught up in the reality of 9/11 . <p> I was scared , like everybody else . " OK , what is this new world we 're going to be living in ? Is it going to be fucking Belfast here ? " And I did n't want to fucking fly nowhere . I remember thinking at the time - this was when they were shooting the Matrix sequels in Australia - " What if everything , all this shit , breaks out , man ? And all that 's left in Hollywood are the Matrix people ? That would be a fuckin ' drag " laughs . <p> Are there any movies recently that just knocked you out ? <p> For the last five years , the two American movies that I like the most were the first Matrix and Fight Club . And the more I think about Fight Club , the more I like it . I think it has the best dialogue I 've heard . I really loved Gus Van Sant 's remake of Psycho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting experiments in the history of the cinema . Also , a movie that I really love is M. Night Shamalamadingdong , whatever his fuckin ' name is : Unbreakable . It 's one of the best comic-book movies ever made . I really like his success . And I know enough not to follow everything the critics say , but actually the critics talked me out of seeing it originally . <p> So how do you feel about , say , " Adaptation " ? That 's a movie the critics love . <p> I actually thought the movie worked perfectly until the whole thriller aspect came into it . I 've never been so into a movie and so immediately checked out . I like Charlie Kaufman . But I was n't that really into the John Malkovich movie , either . It 's one of those things where it 's smart and it 's funny , but it 's not that smart and it 's not that funny . It 's clever . But clever only gets you so far . Smart only gets you so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking back on Quentin Tamntino 's role in cinema , where do you see yourself ? <p> I hope twenty years from now people will think I 'm one of the greatest directors who ever lived . rs <p> " I wanted to make a better movie than ' Pulp Fiction .
