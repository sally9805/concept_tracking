IF YOU EVER WANT TO see a setting truly fit for a fantasy novel , it 's best to come to West Virginia first . Like the state 's motto , we are very wild here , wild in thought , sometimes wild in appearance , but always wild in landscape . <p> You notice it only a few miles after crossing the state line from Virginia into West Virginia . Our mountains are n't the type that jutted up out of the Earth during ancient upheavals . Our lands formed when water and ice dug down into the Earth , carved deeply and harshly through her plateaus to reveal her womb of smooth , solid rock . Rivers surge through nearly every low area , cold and broad and disdainful of man , yet invigorating to the eye , flowing with magic 's clear blood . They call us the Mountain State , but what we really are is the land of secret valleys , of places where most people do n't belong and soon leave , after remarking on their beauty . <p> I was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in bad shape when I arrived , thinking a nice convalescence in these deceptively gentle hills would be just what I needed . I did n't need it . I p should have run , dumped all my baggage , both real and imagined , and fled by any means possible , jet , train , bus , on a hog wearing a saddle and hackamore , whatever . I should have left , but I did n't . I became trapped . First by poverty , then by something much stickier , nearly impossible to transcend . Something that called to me with a voice I 'd longed to hear my entire life , magic - real magic - the kind that does n't care if you believe in it and gives you power whether you want it or not ( I did at first ) , power that will drive you mad if you let it , and I 'm afraid that I am . Just a little . <p> I was already half nuts by the time I met Landry . He served me my grilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Frost Knob the last weekend in September . Being what I was , haunting the village at Frost Knob was like dining with the enemy , but I could n't help myself . Frost Knob is the closest thing there is to civilization in my part of the Appalachians . It 's the highest ski resort on the East Coast , and during the season the place sucks in well-heeled metropolitan types from D.C. , New York , and across the south . Though I did n't ski and almost never talked with anyone on my visits to 4,900 feet , I could brush by tourists wearing Ralph Lauren sheepskin jackets or carrying the latest overnight tote by Prada and draw in tantalizing hints of halfway intelligent speech - a clause here , a truncated exchange there , mention of marketing meetings , the latest editorial in The Times , gossip about someone 's botched eye job , or silly , fractious arguments over aborted play dates , what I call miscellaneous city talk . I walked through the resort 's cobbled square , opening my ears like radar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , and a Starbucks , I 'd reel in these little snippets of civilization , like a fisherman on a sea so lonely he 's reduced to holding one-sided conversations with the fish flapping and gasping in his net . <p> I wanted so badly to return to the world I once inhabited , have friends again , find a life , but I could n't . It would n't let me . <p> " Would you like the fries , rice pilaf , or Tumpin ' Jack black-eyed peas with that ? " Landry asked me as he stood next to my table in the Gearhead Bar &.; Grill . He was memorizing my order as I gave it to him , rather than write it down . This either spoke well of his memory or poorly of the house count , most likely the latter . Snow had n't yet begun falling up here , nor was it cold enough to make the white stuff artificially and keep it on the ground . Still , with this being the height of the resort 's fall foliage season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists as dying leaves . It was n't . I 'd taken care of that . <p> Glancing up into Landry 's troubled face , I felt bad about his lack of paying customers . <p> " Pilaf , " Isaid . <p> " Alrighty , " he said . " I 'll go put this in and be right back with your Cosmo . " <p> It was the ahighty that got me . That a man who stood over six feet and waited tables like a Grizzly practicing jeet kune do could use a word like that suggested a self-possession I immediately liked . The ahighty was n't canned like the automatic responses you learn to use with the paying public . It was just him . <p> He returned with my Cosmo , heavy on the cranberry , in a frosted martini glass that could have served half a frat house . <p> " Wow , " I said . <p> " Frost Knob invites you to ski happy , " he said . " When we finally get snow , that is . " <p> I concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this time . A rare early blizzard . " <p> " Is that the Weather Channel talking , or are you merely prescient ? " <p> " Maybe it 's just that there big toe I broke a ways back that acts up when the weather 's a-changing , " I said , doing my best , tasteless imitation of my hick neighbors over in Cherry Lick . I instantly felt a rush of PC-induced guilt , and smiled apologetically a moment later . <p> He assessed me and I studied him . I saw his name , LANDRY , spelled in machine-engraved letters on the gold plastic tag pinned to his uniform . I saw the confident way he wore the god-awful acrylic ski sweater they 'd given him , his expensive haircut only just starting to grow out , nails that were still neatly manicured , teeth and fingers that were free of nicotine stains . I 'd served food and drinks off and on most of my life and I knew he was n't a waiter , not really . <p> " You do n't belong here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he glanced down at the last scraps of city cool I still owned , my ten-year-old Betsy Johnson dress , which no longer fit as well as it should , and the Okio sunglasses lying on the table next to my West Virginia driver 's license , he smiled . <p> " Neither do you . " <p> " Oh , yes , " I said . " Unfortunately , I do . " <p> Finishing lunch and deciding to give Landry my real phone number instead of one with an incorrect digit , I drove down the mountain to the base of the resort 1,700 feet below . Just west of a T-intersection joining Frost Knob to the main highway leading back to parts known , I spotted four people climbing out of a Cadillac Escalade . It was parked next to a handcrafted billboard advertising a new five-hundred-unit development that would soon replace the hardwood forest beyond it . LUXURY IN CONCERT WITH NATURE , read the developer 's slogan . This meant they 'd leave a few landscape-quality trees behind when they clear-cut the rest to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Tracker into the parking lot in front of the tiny grocery that served the people who stayed in condos already built . I felt It coming over me , into me , using me and me using It . <p> It waited , curled inside me , watching the four as they flipped through their glossy brochures . The saleswoman in the group gestured at a seventy-foot sugar maple , its glorious crown torched by leaves just starting to turn , and then to an area on a plat map . Two of the visitors were husband and wife , and the husband tramped up the newly bulldozed ridge behind the sign to capture virgin terrain with his digicam . <p> This was the moment It could use to its best advantage , my magic . I could n't help myself , did n't want to help It , but I had become It . <p> I took a soft , deep breath , then released my hold on the deep place within that understood and could manipulate both humans and forest effortlessly . I raised my left hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hold a solar eclipse in the palm of your hand - a black hole the size of a man 's kidney , with a hundred snapping tentacles that sucked light and life toward it with the violence of a rip current - that would describe just one of the things my magic does . Though it was n't necessary , since the thing could fly through my windshield without being altered , I rolled down the driver 's side window and flung it gently into the air . <p> It shot with laser precision toward the man with the digicam . None of the four could see it , of course . I sighed , watching the thing go to work on him , hovering beside one ear and then the other , sticking its tentacles into each , wriggling and digging farther and farther inside his head , past eardrums deep into the part of the brain where mankind 's most primitive reflexes reside . The man stiffened instantly , but did n't understand the shudder that raised the hairs on the back of his neck . Backing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the man 's eyes next , prying up first one eyelid , then the next , sticking a tentacle underneath and smearing his eyeballs with an oily dark light . To the man , it would feel as if the forest had suddenly grown closer and darker . He would feel its lonely , claustrophobic embrace reaching out to smother him . When the thing stuck more of its tentacles up his nostrils , along the nerves and into his parietal lobes , the man would , to a lesser degree , smell the same type of panic that immobilized a horse in a burning barn . <p> Finally the black ball was finished with him . It floated toward the man 's wife next . By the time it reached her , it was losing energy , moving less vigorously . It stuck a single tentacle into the woman 's ear , and then as if pulled by a vacuum , its entire body was sucked , protesting and fading at the same time , inside her head . <p> Man and wife abruptly broke off what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains crowding them in on all sides . Both tensed , their shoulders rigid , the complacent smiles they 'd worn moments before gone . The man quit filming and stared worriedly into the shadows beneath the trees . seconds later , he returned to the Cadillac while the wife distanced herself from the saleswoman , who noticed the change in her client 's behavior , but did n't know what to make of it . A few polite yet terse exchanges later , all climbed into the Cadillac . The SUV remained a few minutes more , while the saleswoman struggled to salvage her deal , but it was useless . <p> They drove away . <p> I sat there in my car for another ten minutes , giving them a solid head start toward the safety of the sales office and human habitation . Then , thinking about Landry and his lack of paying business , I raised my left hand . On it was a tiny curl of misty light that moved up and away without my help , tendrils beating at the speed of a hummingbird 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracker on its way toward the interstate , the most popular route to Frost Knob . Bouncing from tree to tree , the tiny light dispelled the shadows my magic had placed there three weeks before , shadows the naked eye could n't see , but that were sensed by the unconscious minds of all but the least sensitive . <p> I AM THE GODDESS of Lonely Spaces . Please bear in mind that I had to come up with this title by myself , as there 's never been anyone to tell me who I 've become . I may not be a goddess at all , but merely an oddity . <p> To explain what I do , let me tell you about my favorite road in these mountains , Route 7 . Beginning at the turnoff from U.S. Highway 219 at Millerton , it stretches for fifty-eight miles , most of it through the Monongahela National Forest , until it reaches Freedom Forge . Winding and bending , climbing and climbing , it traverses the most sublime example of natural beauty in North America . If you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highway 99 from Vancouver to Whistler , with its astonishing drop-offs to the pewter sea thousands of feet below , you may have thought you traveled the road to Valhalla . If you 've ever been fortunate enough to take the ribbon of asphalt descending out of Los Alamos , New Mexico , with the whole of mystic Black Mesa to your northeast and the pink cliffshat become fuchsia at sunset guiding you to a dusty high desert freeway below , you might be tempted to think you 're seeing exactly what the Zuni and Hopi saw thousands of years ago when they first came to the land . Take Route 7 from Millerton to Freedom Forge , however , and you 'll discover a landscape so potent and unmolested it 's enough to make you weep . Unlike these other roads , you can drive the entire fifty-eight miles and never pass another car , mobile home , gas station , or fast food restaurant . Instead you are immersed in a maze of trees reemerging triumphantly from the decimation of old growth forests during the previous two centuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon tunnel of green in the summer months , through chutes of molten red and orange leaves in the fall . You pass tiny waterfalls of stacked limestone that spray froth at your windshield and are so numerous and unplanned they appear like volunteer fruit trees springing up from carelessly thrown peach pits . You encounter a glacial bog that exists nowhere else in the U.S. and is lush with wild cranberry and orchids and insect-catching plants . In the winter the entire road becomes a black and white photographer 's dream - black trunks , black ground , white snow , and falls frozen into monumental ice sculptures . You drive and twist and turn and marvel that there could still be a place like this in the world and somewhere about mile twenty-three it hits you . <p> Loneliness . <p> This place is too lonely for you . It 's gorgeous , but you want to see something else , a town , a house , even a strip mall . You want to see signs that you are n't totally alone here . To hell with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashing Cherry River that dogs the highway like a New Age fanatic who wo n't leave you alone until you buy one of his idiotic healing energy crystals . You want a goddamn McDonald 's . Fifty-eight miles of peace and quiet now seems like five hundred and eighty . You want out but you ca n't make up your mind . Would it be better to turn around and go back ? Or should you continue on in hopes that you 'll regain civilization sooner ahead ? <p> To an extent , Nature performs this protective magic all on its own , as it has for tens of thousands of years , keeping people who would destroy it at bay . In these modern times , however , with mankind wielding the sword of technological superiority , human psychology alone is n't enough to send men and women with chainsaws and Bobcats rushing from dark glades and isolated valleys , back to the blare and growl of the city , glancing nervously over their shoulders as they flee . <p> I have to do it . <p> Landry called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone in his business , since he probably did n't get off work until close to midnight . <p> " Did business pick up at all after I left ? " I asked . <p> " God , we were slammed . It was dead the rest of the afternoon and even the first part of dinner . They were even ready to let me go early . Then around seven all gustatory hell broke loose . " <p> I calculated the time backward mentally . It 's a good two-hour drive from the Interstate to Frost Knob and the little tuft of light I released at two-thirty would have cleared the darkness along the highway from the freeway to the resort by four . Instead of stopping to cancel their reservations in Lewisburg and turn around , as I 'd encouraged them to do for weeks , the first of the hordes would have reached Frost Knob 's check-in desk by six o'clock , and had an hour to get settled before descending on Landry in Gearhead . The timing fit . <p> " So what are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teapot clock on my kitchen wall , " - 8:47 ? You must be exhausted . " <p> " I could n't sleep . I 'm thrilled . I 'm flush . After paying my first month 's rent I 've got an amazing wad of cash burning a hole in my pocket . Want to do something ? " <p> " How big a wad ? " <p> " Just a sec . Let me count . " <p> I waited , but he was quick . <p> " Eighteen dollars ! " he said . <p> " Good thing you called me , " I told him . " If you 're willing to leave campus , I can show you entire towns around here you could buy for that . " <p> " With change leftover for dinner ? " <p> " And breakfast , " I said . <p> I had n't meant that to be a double-entendre , but I 'm out of practice using the dialect from the land of my birth . Landry 's voice held that mischievous grin I 'd loved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fifty-dollar jar of Dean &; DeLuca honey , but he opted to be a gentleman and instead pretended my slip had gone clear over his head . <p> " So where can we do the most damage with my eighteen dollars ? " <p> I took him to a bakery in the middle of nowhere . That is n't much of a description , really , since everything around here is in the middle of nowhere , but I thought my bear would like the cinnamon sticky buns this place had to offer , baked in a genuine wood-fired oven . He did , devouring a six-pack of gooey rolls before we could finish our first cup of Mauajava . <p> " What is this place doing out here ? " he asked , incredulous to find a gourmet-quality coffee and pastry spot on a vacant two-lane road an hour from even the least traveled tourist route . <p> I shrugged . " What is anyone doing out here ? " <p> " What brought you here ? " he asked , turning more serious than I liked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost Knob . " <p> " Bankruptcy , foreclosure , and homelessness after your systems analyst job was outsourced to Pindladoor ? " he asked . <p> " How 'd you guess ? " I said , favoring him with a sympathetic smile over his situation . <p> He waited patiently for my real explanation . <p> " Is there really a place called Pindladoor ? " I asked . <p> " You 're evading , " he said . <p> I nodded , but I was n't hiding , at least not from myself . I turned my reasons for being here over in my head every day , every hour , every few minutes , with the frequency the average man has thoughts of sex . I hated thinking about that stupid , stupid minute in the barn behind my house eight years ago that changed everything forever , but when your world narrows in on you as tightly as a dress that 's now a size and a half too small , you tend to obsess . <p> It was n't my house or my barn back then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Ariel Walkrip . <p> I grew up in southern California during the post-Brady Bunch Era . Los Angeles was still a demi-paradise , but starting to show a hipper urban edge . My family had lived there since the dawn of motion pictures , just a few hundred yards from where Charlie Chaplin built his studios on a then orange grove-lined Santa Monica Boulevard . When grown , the adults in my family habitually chose from two different professions , real estate or movies . I chose movies , as a writer , or rather a **40;2221;TOOLONG writer . By the time the big earthquake came along in the early 1990s , demolishing my house on top of me , I was having daily work-related panic attacks and fought nightly with my coke-addicted agent boyfriend - who would n't represent my screenplays because he did n't want to look like he " subscribed to nepotism . " <p> I left . I took what little remained unbroken from the earthquake , got on the Internet , and hunted up the cheapest place in the U.S. that I thought I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great American novel . <p> Did I know that New York was n't buying Great American novels anymore ? No . Two years later , with an eviction notice thumbtacked to my door and urgently needing someplace even cheaper to live , I saw Ariel Walkrip 's ad in the local throwaway . <p> Cute 1 br. /l ba. with privacy on 80 ac. farm . $175 per month , utilities included , in exchange for light caretaking duties . 555-2419 . <p> One hundred seventy-five dollars a month ! How far I 'd fallen . I remembered paying more than that for a cut and color in L.A. <p> Walkrip 's farm was just outside an invisible Flying Brigadoon-like town called Cherry Lick . In the summer , the town mysteriously vanished into rampant overgrowth from the forest , houses fenced in by rats ' nests of honeysuckle vines suspended from the trees , cut off by hillsides of weed-laced cornfields . At the end of October , the foliage died and voil , the town reappeared . <p> I drove out to Walkrip 's place the eighth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned off where instructed and plummeted down a driveway so steep it should have had its own runaway truck ramp . At the bottom was the typical West Virginia pre-mobile home era abode , a one-and-a-half story farmhouse on homemade stone footings , recently reclad in rubbery vinyl siding . Instead of the traditional white , Walkrip had gone with cardboard brown . Various outbuildings were strewn about , a chicken coop made out of the back end of a retired U-Haul truck , a series of outhouses built one on top of another like successive civilizations in an archaeological dig , storage sheds , and a barn with an empty corral attached . No cute 1 br. /l ba. guest houses in sight . <p> I called out the owner 's name . Several times . Knocked on his doors , front and back , thinking he might be elderly and hard of hearing . I peered in the windows . No one . This left the barn as the only other logical choice . <p> I turned and walked hesitantly toward the rotting locust-wood structure . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidy and laid out like something on the best of HGTV , each of the mature vegetables in the garden had been ... abused . Every cucumber , pumpkin , and squash had one or more strings tied tightly about their girths . They reminded me of a half-feral calico cat I 'd once rescued . When it was still a kitten , some sicko had placed an industrial-strength rubber band around its midsection and then abandoned it to the wilds . The kitten grew into a cat , and as it did the rubber band restricted and distorted its growth . It probably could have survived this way indefinitely , but when it became pregnant , the result was horrifying . Walkrip 's vegetables had received the same treatment . <p> I halted next to that garden and immediately knew I was n't going to rent anything from this man . As soon as I found him , I 'd let him know I was n't interested . <p> Ariel Walkrip hung from a noose at the rear of the barn . He looked exactly how I 'd pictured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hundred other farmers out here , worn-out body in jeans , plaid shirt , and a John Deere cap . His eyes - were nearly closed , his face bloated and purple , the fingertips on his arthritic hands pendulous and dark as well , like baby eggplant . His feet had swollen so badly with accumulated blood that his tightly tied shoes could n't contain the flesh . It spilled over the constrictions , reminding me of the abnormally grown vegetables outside . <p> Instinctively , I knew he was dead , but I remembered something from research I 'd done for a script involving a CSI team . You have to know what you 're doing when you hang yourself , or else you wo n't snap your neck cleanly . Instead you can dangle and dangle until you suffocate instead , an agonizing way to go . I could n't live with myself if I ran out of the barn without checking first to make certain Walkrip was really deceased and not simply unconscious and in need of emergency help . <p> Fighting every step before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw , I approached . <p> " Hello , " I said . " Mr. Walkrip ? " <p> When he did n't respond , I dared myself , commanded myself , gingerly reached out and took one of his leather-clad toes between my forefinger and thumb to give his foot a little shake . <p> I could n't see It , but I sensed It come awake at my touch . It had crouched there , inside Walkrip 's body , just waiting for me to come along and rescue It . That power over loneliness . It jumped off the dead man faster than a flea and coated Itself to my skin . I went into agony , rny body suddenly unable to breathe as if every inch of it were covered in metallic paint . Rays of silver light stabbed at my peripheral vision and I felt the thing bite into every last nerve ending I had and work its way upstream with its fiberoptic heat toward my brain . My body was wracked with minute convulsions . Choking , losing consciousness , I lifted one hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like video shot by a war correspondent on the run . <p> I fell face first toward a dung-covered floor . <p> When I came to , I knew it was morning . Walkrip swung gently overhead in the breeze and I lay on the barn 's rock scrabble flooring . Poised inches from my face was a green grasshopper , holding up a leaf from a pin oak . As I watched , the insect raised the leaf just a little higher over its head , then dropped it in front of me and slowly backed away , long , crooked leg by long , crooked leg . <p> Frowning , I fumbled for the leaf . The instant I touched it , I knew I was no longer me . The old me could n't tell you exactly where to find the tree it had fallen from . The new me could tell you which branch . <p> Blundering through Walkrip 's unlocked back door in search of a phone to call the authorities , I stepped into a kitchen just as bizarre as the garden outside . Gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of dilapidated particleboard cabinets , two with doors hanging by a single hinge . Centered on the nearest countertop was a piece of paper , and beside that a plate of home-baked Tollhouse cookies covered with clingwrap . <p> SORRY , read the note , in oversized , shaky handwriting . I BAKED YOU SOME COOKIES . <p> I KNEW I COULD N'T tell Landry any of this . I 'd never told anyone . For one , I had no family left , and my friends back in L.A. had all turned out to be of the fairweather variety . I 'd made acquaintances , but no solid friends in my decade lost in Appalachia . As desperately as I wanted someone to talk to about everything , I did n't want to send Landry running and screaming back to his mountaintop . I did n't just want - I needed the connection he offered , like a Hf esaving procedure or the human equivalent of a bottle of Zoloft . <p> " Carly ? " He put down his coffee . " Are you okay ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your question . Why I chose West Virginia . " <p> " Why did you ? " " It 's disaster free . No earthquakes , no hurricanes , no terrorists , tornadoes , riots , or nuclear power plants to melt down . Sure , we have floods , but if you live on a mountaintop , you 're pretty much safe . " <p> " Safety , I can understand that , " Landry said quietly , but his eyes did n't agree with his words . I knew he knew there was more to the story . I watched his eyelids flicker as he studied me , curious for the truth . He opened his mouth , then closed it , and touched my hand instead , stroking it softly with his finger , as the wheels inside him turned . <p> " How did you know ? " Landry asked me over the phone . <p> It was the fifth of October , and outside , the horror that is a West Virginia winter had set in two months early . Winter is dark and choking here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't think straight once it arrives . It comes at you like that stranger you dread at a roadside rest stop , the one who will abduct you and lock you in his trunk until you 're dead and he can play with you . <p> The first snow of every year is like an unwelcome anniversary for me , reminding me that I am trapped with no hope of ever escaping . <p> " Carly ? " <p> " Farmer 's Almanac , " I said finally , explaining away my foreknowledge of the storm I 'd predicted when we met the week before . <p> " You read the Farmer 's Almanac , " he said . He sounded skeptical . <p> " No , but everyone else here does and is constantly blabbing about it . " <p> " Incredible . I figured they used a random number generator to make their predictions , " he said . " Either that or threw groundhogs at dart boards . " <p> " They probably do , " I agreed . <p> We talked for more than two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his jokes . I never did find out how many Pindladoor programmers it takes to screw in a light bulb . Though I sensed he was doing his best to help lift me out of a depression I could n't quite mask , I also suspected that he did n't really enjoy the joke himself , because it touched on a nerve he wished would go numb . He could n't know how grateful I was just to hear his voice that bleak afternoon , warming me with his easygoing humor . <p> As a goddess , my territory is pitifully small . It covers portions of just five tiny counties along the West Virginia state line north of 1-64 , plus a narrow swath of three border counties in neighboring Virginia . I have n't been out of my territory in eight years , ten if you count the two years I lived here before my transformation . I 'm tethered here by the magic that runs through me now . I am at its mercy .

Sixty-five hundred is the threshold at which I go into extreme distress . I do n't want to think about what would happen if someone forcibly took me beyond my boundaries for longer than a few minutes . I know , more than suspect , that the magic inside me would rebel , and likely slip from my control , damaging many around me before it finally fed on and consumed my life . <p> Logically my territory makes little sense . Portions of both the Monongahela and Washington National Forests , not to mention many private and forested lands , extend well beyond it . What , if anything , protects those areas ? I wonder .

He taught me to ski under the stars and begged me to do ridiculous , even embarrassing things , like salsa dance underwater in the resort 's indoor rock grotto pool . He hacked us into their reservation system , where he would appropriate empty condos for us , each complete with balcony hot tubs . We 'd make feverish love in the open air and bubbling water , then afterward lie sated , wrapped in towels on the thick living room carpet . With our faces pressed against floor-to-ceiling windows , we watched Christmas and New Year 's Day dawning through swirling snow that flecked the dead brown hills spread below us like spots on a sleeping fawn . <p> I showed him wonders as well , taking him trekking on snowshoes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even research scientists , loggers , or the forest service had been for more than a century .

Crouching low on a granite spar overlooking one of my secret valleys , we spied on huffing , foraging buffalo whose shaggy manes tinkled with curtains of ice . Hidden downwind in a ring of birch saplings , we peered between the slender trunks while wolf pups entertained us unaware , roughhousing in fresh powder . Landry did n't realize my subspecies of buffalo were supposed from Canada and the buffalo escapees from a ranch raising gourmet steaks . I did n't correct him , but I worried that I had violated my own magic in revealing them to him . If it were n't for my power , I would never have known they were there .

I lay curled against his furry chest in our ill-gotten hotel room bed . The covers were tossed on the floor and our legs sprawled inelegantly on the king-size mattress . We 'd been listening to pine logs pop and sizzle in the fireplace . <p> " What about them ? " I asked , alarm ringing through me . <p> " Nothing really , " he said . He absently fingered a lock of my hair hanging down into my face . " Just thinking about them . " <p> He looked down at me then , gently tucking the lock of hair behind my ear .

We were so close and they did n't even realize we were there . They should have , should n't they ? They have powerful noses . " <p> " I have a powerful nose , too , " I said . <p> " I know you do , " he said , momentarily playful . " You found me . " <p> " And that 's how I found them . " <p> " Why is it then that I 'm a ten times better skier than you , but you 're the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no near misses , no tripping . You 're fearless out there . You even knew exactly when to turn back for home when that squall came up , but let us go just a little farther than we should have . " <p> " I did n't know . I told you . " <p> " You told me , but I think you kept us going until it was almost too late because you thought it was exciting . " <p> " It was exciting , was n't it ? " <p> He frowned , searching my eyes for the answer he wanted and not finding it . <p> " Yes , " he said at last . " I was scared shitless we 'd get turned around and lost in the storm , but we did n't . We made it back . " He paused . " How did you know where to find those wolves , Carly ? " <p> " I 've lived here a long time . " <p> " How long ? " <p> " Ten years . " <p> He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained rather than what it did n't . <p> " How often do you get back ? To the city , I mean ? " <p> " It 's been ten years . " <p> " What ? You have n't left in a decade ? " <p> " I do n't make enough to go anywhere . " <p> I realized how lame that sounded the moment it was out of my mouth . If I could afford the occasional meal at his restaurant , I could afford a tank of gas to take me to D.C. or at least as far as Charlottesville . <p> Rather than question my argument , however , he surprised me by asking , " What would you say if I asked you to come with me when I returned ? " <p> My breath halted in my throat . I was unable to speak as I fought off tears . A truth that is n't a lie . I need a truth to tell him that is n't a lie . <p> " I would love it if I could go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I had n't realized that his arms had tensed around me until I gave my half-baked answer . He relaxed then with a sigh . <p> " Thank you , " he said . <p> I made certain every moment of that season with Landry was as perfect as it could be . During his days on , business flowed into Frost Knob from all points of the compass and ended up at his restaurant . I did n't have any power over the tables he got or how much he was tipped , of course , but on the nights he worked the place was packed . On his days off , however , every highway leading to the mountaintop playground took on forbidding , unwelcome shadows and skiers who lingered too close to the treelines felt something watching them , a natural menace they could n't explain , but which sent them hurrying to their condos to pack up and head back for the city . I did n't want it to be a ghost town , that would have been bizarre and upsetting to Landry , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in to wait tables because Gearhead got too busy . I 'd also spent too much time in the village and the migraines I suffered at exposure to the development there worsened each time I visited . It was like an allergy on overdrive , like a poison taken in gradually larger doses until a lethal toxicity is nearly reached . <p> I begged off from staying in those free hotel rooms , but never once suggested that we go to my place . Landry did n't question me about it outright , but I could tell he thought this strange and he had every right . <p> " I live in a shack , " I told him . " An honest to God hillbilly shack . " <p> " Do n't tell me . With an outhouse ? " <p> " Three . " I neglected to mention that they were no longer used and that my farmhouse had two perfectly usable bathrooms . <p> " What 's the third one for ? " <p> " The third one ? " <p> " One for boys , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Around here ? Lord only knows , " I said . <p> And the topic was dropped , at least momentarily . I ca n't say why I did n't want to bring Landry home . Instinctively , I sensed there was danger for us there . From what , I could n't say , but I knew it the way I knew where to find the missing boy who wandered off in early February , leaving the safety of his parents ' condominium before the sun came up . <p> One afternoon I observed Landry scribble furiously on napkin after napkin he yanked from the dispenser on the window bar at Starbucks . Our seats looked out on the heart of the village . It was one of our favorite spots . That day , however , Landry was deep into his own head , inspired in a way I had never seen him before . <p> " What is that stuff ? " I asked about his writings . <p> " When they let me go , after I was forced to train my Pindladoor replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of profit , " he said . " I 've been searching for a way to take that profit away from them , and this , " he stabbed violently at the latest in his series of napkins with a happy , mad-computer-programmer gleam in his eye , " just may be the way to do it . A new service that makes theirs obsolete ! " <p> " I was wondering why you fled from the city to our fair metropolis , " I said . <p> He looked up at me then , really hearing me for the first time in half an hour . I saw that gleam in his eye wink out and die like a cheap light bulb from China . He stared at me , reluctance on his lips , and said nothing . <p> The silence progressed until it was close to awkwardness . Then more than a dozen non-tourists , most in sheriff and rescue uniforms , rushed by our window . Next came a flurry of civilians , among them a fellow waiter Landry recognized from the restaurant . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . The man pushed open the coffee bar 's front door and leaned inside . <p> " Hey , Landry . " <p> " What 's up ? " Landry asked . <p> " A kid 's gone missing from Mogulmonkey . " <p> Mogulmonkey was a townhouse-style condo complex adjacent to the resort 's snowtube park . <p> " They think he 's been abducted , but they 're mounting a search anyway , " the waiter said . <p> Landry looked stricken . <p> " Okay , " he said . " We 'll be right there . " <p> He hurriedly crammed his notes into his pockets and then grabbed me by the hand . I barely had time to lunge for my purse before I found myself rushing along with the others toward a command post erected under an E-Z UP tent outside the administrative offices . SUVs filled with searchers pulled up as if in a precision driving drill and two women dashed out of the admin building with stacks of photocopied photos of the boy . Radios squawked all over the parking lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Landry . " <p> As if suddenly aware that he clutched my hand fiercely in his , he stopped so hard on the ice I skidded into him . " Sorry . Do you want to go back to Starbucks and wait for me ? " <p> I studied his expression , trying to figure him out . " No , of course not . You know how well I know this area . I want to help . It 's just that - " <p> " Good girl , " he said , squeezing my hand . We continued our sprint toward the command post . <p> He finally released me once he reached the line-up dividing the volunteers into search parties . I backed away into the trees . Landry did n't even notice . If the boy was still in my territory , I could find him . I only needed a moment . <p> Most people think of the forest as an insensate thing , but it feels just like the rest of us . I closed my eyes and touched the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own terror and sending it outward in waves . They told me what I needed to know . Confused by the pre-dawn mist , the boy had walked off a cliff . When I returned to the E-Z UP , Landry already had our search assignment . He showed me our section of grid on the map . I shook my head . <p> " Who has that ? " I pointed at an area well beyond the last black diamond run . <p> " No one , I think , " he said . <p> " I think that would be the best place to look . " <p> Vertical lines appeared between his eyebrows and his lips turned down . " Why ? " <p> " There 's an old mine down there . " <p> " A mine . What kid would want to check out a mine in the middle of February ? " <p> Landry was right . Besides , the mine was actually securely boarded and miles from where I sensed the boy at this very moment dropping exhausted into a shaded ice bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please , Landry , " I said . " I have a hunch . " <p> He sighed . " All right . " He went to speak to the search coordinator . <p> A few minutes later we were in my Tracker , bombing down an officially closed road on the backside of the mountain . Snow heaped on the road in two- to four-foot drifts , and beneath that , rock-hard berms crisscrossed both lanes . As testament to the strangely grim mood affecting Landry , he made no mention of the road 's condition or my outrageous driving . I saw a torment in him I did n't like . My sole concerns were to rescue the boy and relieve Landry 's unexplained suffering . <p> Once we reached the only route accessible to us I knew we were even farther from the child than we had been at the top of the mountain . We 'd find his bloody footprints in the snow approximately four and a half miles to the north-northeast . <p> How would I direct Landry where we needed to go without drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , I hesitated at the side of the road and glanced up at the sun 's position in the sky . We would n't reach our destination before dark and Landry , as strong as I knew him to be , did n't have the energy to make it to the boy 's side before nightfall . No one did . <p> What does it sound like when you 're struck by lightning ? People who imagine the event often think that the unlucky victim hears a crash , a bang , something on the order of a sonic boom , a fiery crackle from God 's own hand . In reality it 's nothing like that . The last thing you hear before you die is a simple click . <p> That 's what Landry heard next . Behind his back , I lifted my hands to the sunny blue and whispered a single word . <p> Landry cried out , not in pain , but surprise . For a split second the skies over my miles and miles of territory went totally dark . <p> " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breastbone like a lance as he turned to ask me if I 'd just seen what he 'd seen , a moment 's pitch black . <p> He staggered back , gasping like a fish who has suddenly learned to breathe , and clutched at his chest . A second after that he sucked in a deep , confident breath . His cramped shoulders pushed down and back and he stood taller . His head came up , a near-delirious smile lighting his face , truly from within . His eyes and his cheeks warmed with a healthy , sure glow . He had no idea what had happened to him , would n't even be certain that something had happened to him , but he liked it . <p> I pretended frustration . " I 'm sorry , Landry , now that we 're down here , I 'm not sure which way to go . All these trees and no path . " <p> He turned in the direction we needed to go , beckoning me to follow . " Do n't worry . This way . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at a pace that I hoped he would n't compare to normal speeds . I also prayed he would n't wonder how I could possibly keep up with him . The light inside him touched the salt cedars as we swept past and the trees told the light inside him what it needed to know . <p> By twilight , he knelt by the crumpled body in its hollow of ice . <p> I gasped when I saw the boy , lips dark as frozen blueberries and his right foot nearly cut in half from his fall onto rocks at the bottom of the cliff . How had he managed to march so far with his foot flapping the wrong way at every step ? <p> Humans amaze me , I thought with wonder . <p> The boy whimpered . Landry scooped him up and we took off at a run . At first Landry led the way unerringly back to the car as the child grew quieter and colder . Halfway there , though , we knew we were losing him . Landry ran faster , then began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only did he slow dangerously , but - <p> " I do n't remember which way , " he said , faltering . <p> " I do , " I prompted gently . " I remember . " <p> I practically had to drag them . When Landry broke through the final knife-sharp stretch of ice between us and the car , he tripped and crashed to his knees , almost dropping the boy in his weariness . <p> This momentary weakness put a fear in him I did n't understand . He hugged the boy tighter to his chest , cradled him . <p> " Got you , got you , got you , " he crooned , a mantra . <p> " Landry , " I said . <p> " Got you , got you , got you . " <p> I repeated his name . He did n't hear me . He let go of the boy with one hand and raised the hand to cover his eyes in a universal expression of anguish . The woods around us , previously lit by the light shining through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the twilight . <p> In the dark I said , " You have a son . " <p> " Had , " he answered . " A son . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " My wife .... " <p> " Wo n't let you see him ? " <p> " They 're dead . " <p> " Oh , Landry . " <p> " It was after I lost my job . I did n't understand how much it affected her . The foreclosure , the prospect of living on the street . The house was hers originally . It had been in her family for generations . I did n't pay enough attention , " he said . " I think she felt trapped . I think that was why she did it . " <p> " What ? " <p> He dropped his hand from his eyes and the sun looked up at me , with clouds in the way . <p> " Fire , " he said . " She chose fire . " <p> THOUGH THE BOY 'S unexpected and miraculous return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we managed to reach the boy in time , much less find him at all . Almost a week after we rushed the child to paramedics and his hysterical family , the event was old news . I believe Landry regretted his confession to me about his family and his part in their deaths and did n't want that day brought up again . I wished many times he would revive the topic so I could reassure him , but he never did . <p> We picked up our old routines . Though I was in agony much of the time , I joined him enthusiastically again in our pilfered luxury condos . March came , then April , but the slopes remained white and deep . Spring skiing season did n't want to end . Everyone at the resort remarked about the freakishly long season that looked as though it might stretch into May . It would n't . I had limits and should have known the forest would n't let me tamper much longer . It wanted to wake , to get the growing season up and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed every sunny or thunderously rainy day it could harvest from the sky . <p> On the last Sunday in April , we spent several hours hiking the Greenbrier Trail , reclaimed land along the Greenbrier River on which the C &; O Railroad used to transport timber and coal and isolated Appalachian families to the big city . Landry snapped photo after digital photo of Dutchman 's breeches , bloodroot , Jack-in-the-pulpit , and trilliums that grew by the river , every wildflower sparkling with droplets that condensed out of the mist . Afterward , hungry , we stopped at a gas station that sold pizza and biscuits in its convenience store . <p> I knew the store well , because the owner was my neighbor nearly an hour away in Cherry Lick . I did n't like Vernice McCalder and she had been antagonistic with me from the day I moved into Ariel 's place . She would n't admit it , but I suspected that the two of them had had a thing for each other . She 'd probably been expecting to inherit his place . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pulled my Tracker up to the pump . <p> " Better fill it , " I said . " It 's a long way back to the resort . I 'll get us something to eat . " <p> At the back of the store I chose a pizza from one of the two or three habitually boxed and waiting in the glassed warming oven , plus a couple of bottled teas out of the cooler . <p> " You know the only difference between a Methodist and Baptist , do n't you ? " an old farmer said to another man I recognized and knew dug wells for a living . <p> His listener did n't answer . <p> " Methodists can read . " <p> Both men chuckled . <p> Incredibly , though his audience did n't grow , and no significant conversation had occurred in between , the farmer told the same joke a second time just seconds later . I tried to shut out their voices , but still heard the two laugh softly and mindlessly as if the joke were fresh . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached into my purse for my wallet , when , as if caught in a time loop , the farmer by the beer nuts clapped his companion on the shoulder , and sucked in a breath to begin again . <p> " You know the only difference between a - " <p> I nearly bolted from the store . <p> Vernice stopped me . At her post behind the counter , she 'd faced the pumps , observing Landry filling up my gas tank . Now she turned and set something on the counter so she could take my money , which I realized I gripped convulsively in my fist . I looked down and saw what she 'd been holding , a partially completed plastic canvas picture of a teddy bear holding a balloon that read W.W.J.D ? What Would Jesus Do ? Smoker 's lines around her mouth puckered as she studied me . <p> " Not a good idea , " she said , gaze flicking toward Landry . " Ariel would know better . " <p> I was stunned . She knew . She 'd always known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his vegetables and then hung himself in his barn , " I said . " Is he really an example to follow ? " <p> " I 'm warning you , " Vernice said . " Do n't use cuss words in my store , Carly . " <p> I struggled to locate the expletive in my previous two sentences . " Bondage ? Since when is that a swear word ? " <p> She hissed at the repetition of the word and clutched her plastic stitchery to her breast . " God bless you , child . I 'll pray for you at revival tonight . " <p> " Please do n't , " I said and slammed out the door . <p> I have never since felt the way I did the night before Landry was due to leave . I understood my power better then than I had in all the years I 'd possessed it . Loneliness is a fearsome enemy . Humans can stand any number of setbacks - poverty , starvation , the worst pain their bodies can inflict , homelessness , disaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life that remain once a loved one is gone forever . They can weather it and emerge from under the sledgehammer of it all as long they have one thing . Someone to go through it with them . Even if that person is not kind to them , they know at least that they are not alone . <p> What would you do if you were the last person on Earth ? I know what I would do : shoot myself the instant I was certain no one else remained alive . Would I stop to write an epitaph ? Something that extraterrestrial archeologists might discover thousands of millennia from now ? Hell no . Over and done with . B'bye . <p> What would you do , however , if dragged off to an environment that was too different from your own for you to ever be happy ? Not strange enough to make life impossible , but filled with a people whose mindset was so alien from yours that you would never , as long as you lived , find yourself laughing honestly again , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said or did , had no one , absolutely no one to talk to or walk with or run to when life was crap and something devastating happened ? What if you knew you would never see home again ? <p> Then , by miracle , a piece of home comes to you , not just a sliver or a suggestion or an empty memory , but a huge , comforting , bathrobe-sized piece of it . It wraps you up in its remembered cocoon . You sink back into its warmth , hug its security around you and for the first time in years you breathe the type of sigh that signals everything is right with your world . <p> That was Landry to me . Home and much more . If he and I had discovered each other before the earthquake , I never would have ended up in this breathtaking dump called Cherry Lick . <p> He expected me to go with him the next morning . <p> We 'll do this when we get back , Carly . We 'll do that . The start-up will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to worry that I 'll neglect you . I 'll make certain we have all the time we need together . I 'll never lose track of us . <p> I heard echoes of the tragedy with his wife and son , but I also heard the beginnings of something real for us . You ca n't fool the breeze that carries the words your heart speaks . It ferries your soul across spaces open or closed and not even the sturdiest door can keep it out . Only you can refuse to hear it . That is one of humankind 's strongest powers , the ability to not hear another 's heart . <p> I heard his heart . I knew my own . I could n't go and I could n't tell him why . I could change the course of floods , ask a valiant , forgotten apple tree to sacrifice itself so the forest could reclaim its place , calm a frenzied owl before it shredded its wing on a barbed-wire fence , but I could n't face the man I loved and tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did ? <p> Blinding rain savaged my mountains that night . Storms bloated the creeks , sent torrents of frigid mud sweeping down into the hollows . Below my farmhouse , the Greenbrier roared . Water sheeted from my chin . Ropes of it snaked across my breasts and down my arms . <p> I stood motionless in the downpour until I lost track of time . My teeth began to chatter and my skin grew icy . <p> It 's time , I thought . <p> I sank my hand into my own chest and pulled out my heart . For several minutes I held it , studying it without amazement , simply staring . It was a ghostly version , still pumping and bleeding ephemeral red mist . I hurled it at the ground with all the anger inside of me . <p> It hit , a sick thud that terrified the oaks nearby . The thing burrowed into the earth with lightning intelligence , planting itself . In my mind , I could see the thick tree roots under my feet recoiling at the bloody apparition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchored itself in the rocky soil . Less than a minute later it swelled and sprouted spectral mycelium as thick as my wrist , root-like structures snaking outward in all directions , handless forearms that grew and grew . They carried a red river of loneliness , thickening with it until they became as big around as second-year sycamores , then century maples , then old-growth behemoths . <p> Around me trees thrashed in the wind , like waves crashing on invisible rocks . I sensed but could no longer feel my actual , physical heart continuing to beat . The center of me was calm . I was the eye , and storms seen and unseen raged along stalled fronts that would not move as long as I wanted to keep them in place . <p> Standing in the rain , I breathed quietly and waited . At last the voracious growth slammed up against my territory 's boundaries and could go no further . A bloody fairy-ring hundreds of square miles in size lay under all and everything I controlled . Following nature , the phantom mycelium made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , pulsing , veined lightballs that no longer resembled my heart , but carried a piece of it in each . One for every person who needed to leave . <p> Only I could see as they sought their targets , the cheerful hearts of the tourists , the thoughtless ones , musing ones , cruel ones , careless , self-involved , loving and hateful , thousands of hearts spinning in their own individual orbits suddenly touched by the unstoppable panic and fear I fought off daily . <p> " Go home , " I said . " Now . " <p> Turned and walked back to my farmhouse . <p> I stripped off my wet clothes . I curled up on the living room sofa under a blanket I had knit myself from wool purchased from a neighbor and watched television , mindless reality TV . Thunder made the house shiver and mountains cower . Though the village square at Frost Knob swam in frigid water , the asphalt along Route 219 was dry and welcoming . Rain clouds spared each and every road leading away . Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay their flight . It was n't just the resort 's residents I sent packing , however . My fairy-ring found all who were n't already firmly rooted here , those with the luxury of escape . <p> I smiled bitterly . A part of my mind watched the melee from afar , halfzipped suitcases spilling clothing as they were flung into the backs of SUVs , condo and cabin doors left gaping , car doors barely closed before tires spun . Another part of my brain watched a woman on TV in a dirty bathing suit forcing down a bowl of live sand crabs . Arguments and altercations flared here and there throughout the rain-streaked Alleghenies , but they were soon overrun by the group gestalt , that primitive back brain drive to flee , lemmings to the sea of city lights awaiting them . <p> My forest cried . I apologized to it , assured it that this horrible human storm would blow over by dawn , but it cried . I no longer felt the loneliness . I 'd given it all away . No other emotion took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't understand . I could n't be hurting it . I was the forest . I could only hurt the body to which it clung . <p> I thought about that . Ariel and his rope flashed in my mind , a vision opening before me with the gaiety of a Hallmark card pulled from its envelope . But not rope . <p> I threw off the blanket and ran outside again into the deluge . <p> " Carly ! " I heard Landry shout from uphill near the farmhouse . " Carly ! " <p> I shut out his voice . I made the thousands upon thousands of wildly beating hearts rage in my ears as cars hurtled along dark two-lane highways . I laughed . I laughed , cold , wet laughter with the tang of too many dead years , too much of my soul drained out of me . Joyless laughter smothered by the winds whipping the river in front of me . <p> I can ask the river to help me , I thought . I do n't have to do it myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the breath out of my lungs as I prepared to command the black blanket lapping at my toes to reach up and let me sleep next to Mother Earth . <p> " Carly , stop it . " His voice just steps behind me . " Carly . " His hands on my shoulders . Turning me around . Making me look up into his face . He was afraid , of me or for me , I did n't know . <p> " Stop it . " <p> " Stop what ? " <p> " I know what you 're doing . " <p> " Doing . " <p> " This . However you 're driving them out . Stop it . " <p> " I 'm not . " <p> " I know you are . " <p> " How did you find me ? " <p> " The woman at the store , the one you had words with . Now , stop . Someone 's going to get hurt . " <p> " I 'm hurt . " <p> " I know , honey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , but I stepped back up to my calves in the rushing water . <p> " You do n't know anything , " I shouted . <p> " I know . I 've known for weeks . " <p> " You do n't know me . " <p> " The blizzard you predicted , the wolves , the way we found that kid . Did you think I did n't realize what you did to me that day ? " <p> " I did n't do anything . " <p> " The gifts , Carly . Did you think I did n't see the gifts ? At first I thought it was just some freak of nature , one perfect berry , an acorn , a single amazing feather left every morning we woke up together , right at our door . But then I saw them leaving them for you . Saw them making their offerings . " <p> I 'd forgotten about the gifts months ago . They still came , one every morning since I 'd woken in the barn beneath a corpse , but I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciated them . <p> " Landry , I - " <p> Like ripples in a pool , spreading outward from where I stood , the ghosts of my heart abruptly departed . They lifted from the thousands upon thousands of bodies they controlled , drifting upward into the night , thinning into nothingness the way smoke , gray and curling , disappears above a bonfire . I felt the people I 'd wanted to chase away slow and regain their senses . I heard their pulses wind down . Clouds broke off their assault on the land . Skies cleared and leaves dripped . <p> Landry grabbed for and hauled me out of the river . <p> " I ca n't go with you , " I told him . " I want to go , but I ca n't . " <p> " What ? Of course you can . " <p> " No . " <p> He started to protest further , ask why . He thought he knew what I was , but he did n't . So I spread my arms , and as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . <p> I was never naked in my forest . My skin was my gown , bark thick and gnarled as hickories born before Thomas Jefferson made his brave journeys over the mountains from Virginia . Honeysuckle vines caressed and strangled my throat . Branchlets budded and flowered over and over again from my fingertips . I felt that pain and struggle of unending birth , quiet death . My head was pulled back viciously by my hair , grown over the years until it became trapped inside a burl that hung behind my shoulders in the shape of a hood . Heavy , unyielding roots encased my thighs and ankles , hiding everything human in their drapes and folds . Larger , more intricate , thousands of times greater than the roots of the fairy-ring , they traveled out to touch every last growing thing in the mountains I protected . <p> Landry uttered a small , stunned noise . He fought for words , but to his credit , he did n't run . <p> " Which one is the illusion ? " he asked at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he expected . The forest stopped weeping and I began . He watched me for several seconds and I had no idea what he was thinking . <p> " I do n't know anymore . " <p> He picked me up and took me into the house , to my bed . <p> " Carly . " He lay down next to me , wrapped us in the quilt that covered the bed , dried my face and thumbed away my tears with his gentle hands . <p> " I want to go , " I said . " I 'm so tired of being here . " <p> " Shh , " he whispered . " Let me take the pain away . " <p> It was our last time together , so I gave him control . I trusted him to take me all the places I 'd wanted so badly to go . I had dominion over the lonely places , but he owned all the rest , far , golden realms I barely remembered , open , noisy , crowded , landscapes dirty yet lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for itself and thought of no one else , as we thought of no one . For one night . Just this one night they were mine , too . I was homesick , but he took it and spun my ache into pleasure . My desire for release became his reason . He sought redemption inside me . We were warmth and blistering heat , solace and cure for things that can never be completely healed . I dragged every memory of his world from behind the shutters in his eyes , distant sights and sounds that clung to the planes and angles of his face . My lips tasted everything he would see the next day , creative genius and traffic , jealousy and elevators , tandoori chicken , glittering storefronts , smog , and new hope . We were flesh on flesh on flesh and twining urgencies . We ate the moment whole . We gorged . We stole tomorrow out from under our feet and strained to keep it there with us as long as we could . Pushed . Clung . Rocked it between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave . <p> " Give me . " <p> I gave him everything that I had and was . <p> " Let it go , Carly . " <p> I shared everything I knew and did n't , the pain , the power . <p> " Let it all go ! " he cried at the exact moment we touched perfection . <p> Light harsher and more cleansing than if I had borrowed a day 's worth of sun blinded me . I closed my eyes and threw my head back . Ecstasy swept through me like heated syrup . A flash burn of relieved joy prickled the damp skin at my throat , the tender insides of my wrists . Landry cried out . At first I thought it was delight , but then as physical saturation turned to scorching pain , I knew something was wrong . I looked at Landry . The light around us continued to flare so brightly my shocked retinas saw only the black form of a man outlined by a corona . <p> " Landry ! " <p> My back arched in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if someone stuck a spoon into the back of my throat and dug out something that clung there fiercely by its roots . I struggled , gagging , shuddering uncontrollably . It went on and on until I knew I 'd gotten the wish I 'd made down by the river . Oblivion . Landry collapsed heavily atop me , his weight too much for me this close to death . <p> I blacked out . <p> IT WAS N'T EVEN DAWN . No sunlight filtered into my room when I felt someone sit down beside me on the bed . I wanted to wake and speak , see if Landry was okay , if I had hurt him when we made love , but as hard as I tried I could n't sit up . I did n't even have the strength to open my eyes . <p> " Sleep more , " I mumbled . <p> " Sleep more , " Landry agreed . <p> Minutes or hours later , I found myself being carried fully clothed outside . Heard gravel crunching under Landry 's feet . Smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes , managed brief slits before the effort taxed me completely . Still dark . <p> " What 's wrong ? " I said , " It 's not morning yet . " <p> " Hush , little one , " he said . He settled me in the passenger 's seat of the Tracker , buckled my seat belt , and tucked the sleep-tousled hair that had fallen into my face behind my ear . " I want to show you something . " <p> I drifted in and out as the car sped along . Why did I feel so strange ? Why was I trapped in sleep ? I dreamed I felt weak , weaker than I had felt in eight years , but also lighter , like someone who had lost fifty pounds surviving a deadly illness . As if I was unbothered by gravity . I could spring up stairs , climb like an eight-year-old , run and run until I fell down panting and laughing in the grass somewhere with .... <p> " Landry ? " <p> I found myself on my feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Landry passed his hand over my eyes and , slowly , I was able to open them . Disoriented , I did n't recognize where we were at first . I turned in a circle and realized we were at the farthest edge of my territory , where the forest touched the frontage road leading to the Interstate . I had n't dared try and come this far in years . <p> " What is it ? Why are we here ? " I asked . " What did you want to show me ? " <p> " Freedom , " he said . <p> " What ? " <p> I gazed up into his face . Lit by the rising sun , his eyes held pure wildness . Their feral mysteries confused me . His skin gave off the scent of bark and the musty fullness of birch leaves in May . <p> " Oh , God . No . " <p> He gestured at the Tracker behind me , loaded with packed suitcases and boxes of possessions , all of them mine . <p> " This is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go any farther than this . You understand , do n't you ? " <p> Panic filled my chest , my heart stuttered , but the anxiety , the strangling call of the mountains , the crushing weight on my chest were missing . I was so many things at once . Dazed , bereft , outraged , sad , lightheaded . I could breathe . <p> " The pain , " I said . <p> He playfully touched his finger to the tip of my nose . " Gone , " he said . <p> But I saw the grimace of pain tightening the corners of his own eyes , freezing the humor that once lived there . <p> Seconds after he stepped back from our last kiss I could still savor him , like a wine 's finish . Within his aftertaste were two things , utter shock at a loneliness too heavy for any human to bear , and a regret to which he would never admit , the loss of his dream to build a new life in the city . <p> He turned toward the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran after him . " Landry ! " <p> His trees cloaked him before I was more than a few steps into the wilderness . <p> " Landry ! " I cried again , frantic . <p> I stumbled on , but I could n't read the branches or the leaves . The oaks no longer answered me and the breeze was just a breeze . Soon an unfamiliar feeling rooted itself at the back of my neck . Fear . Like the thousands I had sent fleeing the night before , I looked at the shadows and primitive hysteria flowered . Landry was responsible . My power had jumped to him , leaving me without the ability to fight him . <p> I came to a halt in a small clearing . No matter how much I tried , I could n't get my feet to take me deeper into the forest . He barred my way , forcing me toward escape and the bright new life his sacrifice was buying me . <p> In the center of the clearing stood a single white dogwood in full bloom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ray of light reached the lonely tree . <p> " Landry , " I said a final time . <p> My voice triggered a shower of white petals that floated back and forth lazily to the ground . When every last petal lay on the moss below , one of them unexpectedly fluttered up into the air . Not a petal , but a tiny bird . It flew toward me . <p> " I love you , " it whispered as it passed .
