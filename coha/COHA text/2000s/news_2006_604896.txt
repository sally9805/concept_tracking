<p> NASSAU , Bahamas  --  Casino Royale could be the first art-house-style 007 movie . <p> For one thing , the man chasing a terrorist through the tropical undergrowth on the film 's set this week does n't look much like the ultra-smooth James Bond that fans have come to adore over the course of four decades . He 's bleeding , ragged  --  and nowhere near a tuxedo , martini or gorgeous woman . <p> Beyond Bond 's gritty characterization are other techniques and details associated with more low-budget productions . The opening sequence will be in black and white . And even after the movie goes to color in the first act , there 's restless camera movement that gives this Bond an almost documentary feel . <p> And while some settings in Casino Royale place the action in posh resorts and mansions , many locations are more menacing than alluring . The feel is more along the lines of The Constant Gardener than the ice-palace slickness of 2002 's Die Another Day . <p> In one scene shot in wooded land near the beach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been deliberately strewn with trash , ravaged automobiles and clusters of filthy tin shanties to simulate the slums of Madagascar . <p> In these crystal-blue waters and tropical forests of the Bahamas , James Bond is being reborn , withdrawing from the increasing cartoonishness of recent 007 movies in favor of slightly more realistic action , a deeper story line and even a streak of tragedy . <p> " I think there 's a complexity to it , but I think audiences are completely up for that , " says Daniel Craig , 38 , the actor taking over from Pierce Brosnan . He 's the sixth official Bond , following Sean Connery , George Lazenby , Roger Moore , Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan . <p> Not a popular choice <p> But as with any big change to a beloved franchise , Craig ( who was the drug-dealing hero of Layer Cake and Paul Newman 's psychopathic son in Road to Perdition ) has already divided some Bond fans  --  those who welcome the predatory presence he adds and those who dismiss him as not sophisticated or manly enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance for detractors to mock Craig for literally getting his teeth knocked out . He says he just lost a cap on a tooth , and no sign of dental trauma was evident during interviews Wednesday night . <p> The 21 Bond movies have collectively earned more than $1.3 billion at the North American box office , and international sales and home video amount to far more . Bond is a hero who spans generations , including fathers and sons , many of whom , well , bond over the spy movies . <p> It 's a devotion rivaled perhaps only by Star Wars , and Casino Royale 's Nov. 17 release is among the year 's most anticipated . <p> Craig says fans should remember that this is an origin story , so the hero they know is now depicted as a work in progress : " Audiences are attracted to fallible characters . Bond , in this movie , makes a few mistakes . And they form him .

Bond has to know his limitations and overcome them without the help of science-fiction machinery . <p> There 's no catching the real Foucan , so Craig rehearses with a not-so-speedy stand-in  --  while director Martin Campbell ( GoldenEye ) shouts at him to " Run like hell ! " Afterward , Craig says to a crewmember , " Had to slow down ... I nearly had him .

" What comes after it is kind of mind-blowing . It 's going to be Bond , but it 's going to be beyond that , as well . " <p> How Bond drew first blood <p> With audiences favoring a sinister edge to action heroes ( like those in The Bourne Identity and Batman Begins ) , and some vulnerability in even the most indestructible of characters ( think Spider-Man and X-Men ) , producers have decided to show how Bond first got blood on his hands to earn that notorious " license to kill " and also to provide him with a femme fatale who finds ( and exploits ) a weakness  --  instead of being just another one-catastrophe stand . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossed $432 million worldwide , Michael G. Wilson , who produces the Bond films with stepsister Barbara Broccoli , says they felt the franchise had become too far-out . <p> " In the 1970s , the Bond films got bigger and bigger and bigger until we finally got to Moonraker ( 1979 ) in outer space , " Wilson says . " Then we said these pictures are getting away from the essence of Bond , so we made For Your Eyes Only ( 1981 ) , which is a more intimate story . I think it happened again with the last film , with us having invisible cars , an ice palace and a heat-laser thing in outer space . " <p> He hopes Casino Royale will reconnect Bond with his roots . " Our perception , and I do n't know if we 're right or wrong , but the times have become more sober , and people want something more realistic .

Le Chiffre is a banker for an international terrorism network , which is about to collapse unless he can multiply his remaining funds in a high-stakes baccarat game . <p> Bond tracks the terror suspect to a Montenegro casino referred to in the title , where he must defeat Le Chiffre not in a fight , but by claiming his remaining funds in a card game ( though there 's plenty of brutality to follow ) . <p> The moneyed grounds of the One &; Only Ocean Club stand in for the casino . Though only 45 minutes from the slum set , it 's a world apart , an oasis of verdant lawns , luxury rooms and delicate gardens perched on the banks of a white sand beach . The Bond of the jungle chase is an outsider struggling to fit in amid the affluence . <p> " As the character develops within the story , we get the opportunity for him to become this beautifully , elegantly dressed man , " says costume designer Lindy Hemming , who previously dressed Brosnan for the Bond films . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty undercover man before , it 's kind of a big shock and it 's really nice when we see him immaculate .

Producers chose the French actress Eva Green , a smoky-eyed beauty from Ridley Scott 's Kingdom of Heaven . This time she 's responsible for providing a soulfulness in her relationship with Bond . <p> Green , who is on location in the Bahamas but has not yet started shooting her scenes , is already worried about typecasting and takes umbrage at being referred to as " a Bond girl . " <p> " It sounds like a bimbo or something , " says Green , 25 . <p> It 's nothing like the novel <p> The film strays far from the 1953 Ian Fleming novel , and despite the flaws the movie ascribes to this young Bond , it still makes him much more heroic than the original book .
