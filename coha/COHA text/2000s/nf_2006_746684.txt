Agitated by the increasing number of school age children not attending primary school in Nigeria , this study set out to investigate the factors that inhibit parents in sending their children to school . A random sample of 2000 parents , whose school-age children do not attend primary school , was drawn from the north , south , east and west of Nigeria . A 14-item four-point scale questionnaire that had a reliability coefficient of 0.63 was used for the collection of data . It was found that the significant factors that discouraged parents from sending their children to school were poverty , value for money , and fear of prevailing unemployment for school leavers and misconceptions about female education . It was recommended , among other things , that the government should pursue a genuine programme of poverty alleviation and economic empowerment of parents so that they would be able to send their children to school . The need to intensify the campaign against sex discrimination in educational opportunities was also recommended . It was further recommended that efforts should be made by the government to diversify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school leavers . <p> Current efforts at educational development in African countries have focused , among other things , on the expansion and liberalisation of educational opportunities for increased school attendance . This is in apprehension of the increasing number of illiterate persons in Africa . For example , it has been reported that the school age children ( 6-12years of age ) who were not attending school : made up 14.1% in Ghana ; 24.2% in Nigeria ; 16.4% in Niger ; 14.9 in Congo ; 13.8% in Kenya and 7.7% in Botswana ( African Education Consortium , 2003 ) . The above figures are obviously staggering and intimidating when viewed against the national populations . Thus , 24.2% of school age children ( about 23 million ) who were not attending school in Nigeria is an indication that the problem of school attendance is massive . It is important to note that the foregoing reports were demographic . The investigation did not seek to find out why the conditions of school attendance were so . These reports have however generated interest in issues and conditions related to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that there has been no significant improvement in school attendance in Nigeria since Evis and Okon made a similar report in 1993 . According to this report , four out of every 10 children of school age were not registered in school . Instead , they were found mainly in busy urban streets hawking different items for money or were found going to the farm with their parents . The investigation further revealed that the youngsters preferred going into commercial and business activities as the surest and quickest means of becoming rich instead of going to school . Garrick and Celia ( 2000 ) had earlier reported that African countries , south of Sahara face almost the same educational crises , largely because of their common colonial experience and inability to grapple with the problem of poverty . <p> Another study carried out by Browns and Ali ( 2000 ) on the rate of dropout in Nigerian primary and secondary schools revealed some startling results . It was found that though dropout existed at both levels , it was more serious at the secondary school level . While the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secondary schools sampled lost eleven students yearly on the average as a result of dropout . However , it would appear that irregular school attendance and dropout is a global scene . There is no system in which all children and youth are in school till completion . Be that as it may , this problem appears to be more acute in Nigeria . According to Hargrove ( 1987 ) and Woods ( 1994 ) , irregular school attendance and dropping out are a complex social problem for which there is no simple solution . Focusing attention on fixing one part of the problem calls attention to the need for solutions to many other parts as well . Hence , the problem calls for policies that involve a broad range of institutions and agencies . Thus , it is increasingly being recognized that the issue of irregular school attendance and dropping out can not be separated from issues affecting the total economic and social structure . These issues according to Peck , Law and Mills ( 1987 ) include poverty , unemployment , discrimination , the role of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drug abuse . Asche ( 1989 ) summed these factors into four broad categories as school-related ; student-related ; community-related , and family-related . To what extent can irregular school attendance and dropping out in Nigeria be attributed to these factors ? <p> In a review of researches on education in selected Africa countries , Quaynor and Azeez ( 2001 ) identified some common features among national educational systems in the continent , especially south of Sahara . These included poor funding , ineffective management , inconsistent policies , differentiation , low school attendance , increasing dropout rate , poor and unattractive school conditions , poorly trained , poorly equipped and poorly motivated teachers , inadequate infrastructures , ineffective teaching and learning . They concluded that these phenomena combined to make schooling meaningless , ineffective and unattractive . These , according to them have reduced the potency of education to transform the societies . They have also made it difficult for the schools to attract and retain students . While Bull and Smith ( 2000 ) were interested in investigating the impact of season and locality on school attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that socio-economic variables had significant influence on meaningful database for school attendance in Nigeria , Ghana and Mali . At present , there is no meaningful database for generating data on the problems of school attendance beyond the provision of demographic information . In another investigation of the state of school attendance in Nigeria , Melford ( 2001 ) reported that though there was evidence of high number of school age children not attending school , variation existed between male and female and between urban and rural populations . This trend has not changed significantly in recent years ( Garrick and Celia , 2000 ) . <p> While all of these countries have acknowledged their failure or inability to achieve education for all ( EFA ) in 2000 as anticipated by UNESCO , they do not seem to have given up . Instead , the goal post has been shifted for the realisation of this target depending on their peculiar socio-economic , socio-political and socio-cultural conditions . For instance , it is targeted that illiteracy would have been wiped out or reduced to the barest minimum in Nigeria by the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions of school in Nigeria and how they affect school attendance are those of Urevbu ( 1997 ) , Iyamu and Aduwa ( 2004 ) and Iyamu ( 2005 ) . Using empirical data and illustrations to support the arguments put forward , these authors presented the school system in Nigeria as having been overtaken by monumental crises . Considering the unattractive , unconducive and dilapidated school environment , these authors are of the view that Nigerian teachers and parents should be grateful to the children who still attend these schools which do not make impact on the quality of life . Urevbu ( 1997 ) is further critical at the subtle legitimation of dropping out of school especially with reference to the National Policy on Education ( FRN , 1998 ) that prescribes a very vague and fluid condition for children 's movement from the Junior Secondary to the Senior Secondary School . For instance , according to the National Policy on Education , the Senior Secondary School shall be for those leaving Junior Secondary School who are able and willing to have a complete secondary school education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded as ability and willingness . Thus , individuals have the freedom or choice to remain in school or drop out . Besides , this appears to have some political and ideological underpins . For a country that is eager to achieve education for all in the year 2015 , it is expected that more definite , compelling and unbiased conditions be given to encourage school attendance and retention . <p> The Problem <p> Records and experiences have shown that the rate of increase in the number of school-age children who are not attending primary school in Nigeria has reached an alarming level . This phenomenon has persisted despite various efforts of government and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) to propagate education and school attendance . Questions need to be asked concerning this backward condition of the society . Inquiries need to be made into the critical factors that inhibit primary school attendance if the nation wants to achieve the present target of education for all in 2015 . In this regard , could poverty , high cost of schooling , societal orientation toward materialism , employment uncertainty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant constraints to primary school attendance in Nigeria ? The orbit of concern of this study therefore is on the factors that militate against primary school attendance in Nigeria . <p> Clarification of Concept and Scope : <p> Attendance : This is used in this context to mean the registration , daily presence and retention of children in school until they complete their education at that level . This study was limited to children of primary school age ( 6 to 12 years ) who are not attending school . They were those in Northern , Southern , Eastern , and Western Nigeria . <p> Purpose and Significance of Study <p> Education in Nigeria is already at a crossroad . While there are expressions in government quarters indicating concerns about education for all , the crises and contradictions in the system and the corresponding public disenchantment in the schooling process have manifested in increasing number of school age children not attending school . This study seeks to explore the important factors that impede school attendance in Nigeria . Specifically , it is aimed at finding out the contributions of such factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values and beliefs , and poor physical conditions of the schools to the dilemma of school attendance in Nigeria <p> The governments at federal and state levels need empirical reports on the factors that inhibit attendance in the nation 's primary schools . In this way , they become well informed in formulating appropriate policies and programmes aimed at ameliorating the backward situation . Similarly , parents and the school will develop greater insight into the issues related to school attendance in Nigeria and become more alert to their roles as agents of education in the society . <p> Procedures <p> This study employed the survey design . It sought to elicit information from parents on why a growing number of school age children do not attend primary school in Nigeria . It used a total of 2000 parents selected by means of purposive random method from the four broad regions of Nigeria These were parents with children of school age but who were not attending school . <p> To collect data for this study , a 14-item questionnaire was designed on the possible factors that inhibit school attendance in Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , significant ( S ) , slightly significant ( SS ) and not significant ( NS ) . These were weighted 4 , 3 , 2 and 1 respectively . The respondents were expected to choose one of the above options for each of the questionnaire items depending on how they considered the constraints . After a pilot test of the instrument , and employing the split half analysis , this instrument was found to have reliability co-efficient of 0.63 . Research assistants , notably postgraduate students who hail from these parts of the country , were enlisted for the collection of data . Households in selected towns and villages were visited <p> Results <p> at random and inquiries made of school age children who were not attending school . Where they were found , their parents were requested to respond to the questionnaire . In some cases , where parents were illiterate , the research assistants used the local dialects to explain the questionnaire to them and recorded their responses accordingly . <p> To answer the research questions , the responses of parents were weighted on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items were computed . For decisions , the mid-value of the scale , which is 2.5 , was taken as the hypothetical cut-off point . This was obtained by adding the exact lower limit of the scale ( i.e. 0.5 ) to the exact upper limit ( i.e. 4.5 ) and divide by two . Any mean score of 2.5 and above was considered significant . <p> Discussion <p> The analysis of data on Table 1 shows that 11 out of the 15 factors listed on the questionnaire were significant . This means that they are the significant factors that impede primary school attendance in Nigeria . On a closer look , the study revealed that poverty-related factors rank highly among the inhibitants of school attendance . Majority of the parents do not send their children to school owing to their poverty and inability to afford high cost of school materials and school fees . This finding corroborates the views of Garrick and Celia ( 2000 ) that education in Africa is handicapped by the poverty of individuals and governments . It is not surprising therefore that the electorates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . Similarly , the inability of parents to send their children to school because they have many of them is still related to poverty . Poverty means that the per-capita income of the household is low and this affects their propensity for education . <p> The growing apathy to schooling among parents and children in Nigeria is to some extent related to the changing value system in the society . According to the present findings , people now worship money and wealth in Nigeria and rarely have regard and respect for education and educated people . There is also the misconception that one gets rich quicker without going to school and that those who go to school rarely get rich . Many parents and youths have been misled by such misconceptions resulting in growing number of children who do not attend school . The position held by these parents appears to be gaining credence and popularity considering the obvious decline in the economic returns to schooling in Nigeria as a result of underemployment and unemployment . Sometime ago , Ali ( 1999 ) had drawn the attention of Nigerians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society were drifting . According to Ali ( 1999 ) , the tendency toward materialism is capable of eroding discipline and decency in the society and making children abhor education , which is an inevitable means of equipping individuals for useful living . The present finding is a testimony of the above fear and alertment . <p> Another significant finding in this study is the continued influence of socio-cultural values and beliefs on the education process . According to the finding , parents are hesitant to send their female children to school because of their early marriage and the fear that a woman is meant to get married and look after the home and not to go to school and get corrupt . Similarly , they still hold on to the practice that a female child has to be given out in marriage as early as possible ( between 8 and 12years ) so that the future husband would contribute to their feeding and upkeep . They also believe that early marriage prevents the young girls from having sexual experience with other men too early in life . More importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride prices and opportunity of having grandchildren early ( Isah , 2000 ) . <p> The need to have male children join in the farm work was found to be one of the important reasons for not attending school . This finding corroborates the earlier findings of Bull and Smith ( 2000 ) on the influence of season and locality on school attendance in selected African communities . According to that study , school attendance was low during planting and harvest seasons . <p> Conclusion and Recommendations <p> The study set out to investigate the factors that impede primary school attendance in Nigeria . It was found that poverty , high cost of schooling , value for money , misconceptions about female education and the increasing rate of unemployment are significant factors which constitute hindrances to school attendance . Consequently , it may be concluded that : Majority of poor parents do not send their children to primary school in Nigeria Majority of children who do not attend primary school in Nigeria are female . The love for money makes majority of parents not to send their children to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be encouraged by their parents to go to school in Nigeria <p> The following recommendations are hereby made to redress the present dilemma of primary school attendance in Nigeria <p> ( i ) The government should embark on result-oriented poverty alleviation programmes and economic empowerment of the masses . <p> ( ii ) There is need to invest in the local production of school materials to make them affordable for the poor . <p> ( iii ) Government should subsidize the prices of school materials . <p> ( iv ) Free-tuition education policy should be embarked upon for the benefits of the poor only . <p> ( v ) Parents should be re-oriented through mass media and community extension services on the need for equal educational opportunities for female children . <p> ( vi ) The economy should adequately be stimulated to promote investment and employment to provide employment hope for school leavers . <p> ( vii ) Effective national orientation is needed to redress the current distortion in the value system so that the love for money does not kill the need for education .
