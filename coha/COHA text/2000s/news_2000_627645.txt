<p> When the Houston Texans make their debut in 2002 , expect them to be playing in the AFC Central with Pittsburgh , Cleveland and Cincinnati . Sources familiar with realignment negotiations say that Houston is almost assured of being placed in the AFC Central , which will please owner Bob McNair . <p> McNair and general manager Charley Casserly have been lobbying behind the scenes for the Texans to play in the AFC Central when the NFL is realigned into eight divisions of four teams each . Tennessee and Baltimore would leave the division , and Houston would replace them . <p> McNair does n't have a vote on expansion , but considering he paid a record-breaking $ 700 million for his franchise , commissioner Paul Tagliabue and other owners are listening to him and trying to accommodate him . <p> Cleveland owner Al Lerner , who is powerful behind the scenes , and president Carmen Policy , who is very influential , have been lobbying for Houston to play in their division . <p> There is not an owner more powerful , influential and respected than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Baltimore as the fourth team , let Tennessee leave and place Houston in a new division , but he admitted that he could be swayed by a good argument . League sources say Rooney has been swayed to McNair 's side . <p> That leaves Bengals owner Mike Brown . Although Brown prefers Indianapolis as the fourth team , he 's never been an owner who rocks the NFL boat . For that reason , he will support the majority if he believes it 's in the league 's best interests . <p> Why the AFC Central for Houston when the Texans would have such a natural rivalry with the Titans ? <p> McNair and Casserly say they believe the AFC Central is the ideal situation for the Texans because the Oilers/Titans have played in that division since the merger in 1970 . They say Houston-area fans have a traditional rivalry with Pittsburgh , Cleveland and Cincinnati . <p> What you will never hear McNair and Casserly say is that they want to play in the AFC Central because the Texans would have a chance to be successful faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been speculation in the NFL that Houston would be part of a newly created AFC South with Tennessee , Jacksonville and Indianapolis , but do n't count on that happening . <p> Although the salary cap and free agency can reverse a team 's fortunes in a flash , common sense tells us that the Texans would have a chance to win faster in the AFC Central . <p> The Bengals are perennially one of the worst franchises in professional sports . Although their record does n't reflect it , the Browns are the worst team in the league in their second season and do n't show many signs of improving consistently . The Steelers have a winning record , but even though they 're moving into a new stadium next season , they may still lose a lot of key players through free agency . <p> Now , compare the AFC Central to what could happen in the AFC South . The Titans posted a franchise-best 13-3 record last season and reached their first Super Bowl . They currently have an eight-game winning streak and are tied for the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running back Edgerrin James and receiver Marvin Harrison , the best threesome in the NFL . The Colts are run by general manager Bill Polian , who is one of the best in the league . <p> Jacksonville is down and experiencing its worst record since its inaugural 1995 season . The Jaguars should be down for two or three years , but they still have an outstanding owner in Wayne Weaver and an exceptional organization run by coach Tom Coughlin . <p> So which division would you choose ? The AFC Central ? Right . And Bob McNair thanks you . <p> <p> AROUND THE AFC <p> Motivational ploy - Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt has used some interesting tactics to motivate his team . He took them bowling during camp . He 's taken them to two movies for inspiration . When players reported for work Wednesday , they found mousetraps in their lockers . The idea was to not reach for the cheese too soon - cheese being the playoffs . <p> " I thought it was pretty funny , " offensive tackle Richmond Webb said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been saying this week and all season long - take one game at a time . " <p> Added strong safety Brian Walker : " It 's kind of self-explanatory . We got the message . " <p> Wannstedt said he got the idea from Bill Parcells , who once used mousetraps to illustrate a point . <p> KISS method - Ravens coach Brian Billick fancies himself as an offensive genius , but when his team went five games without scoring a touchdown , his reputation took a beating . For the Cincinnati game last week , Billick reduced the game plan for Trent Dilfer , who was starting his first game at quarterback over the benched Tony Banks . <p> " I 'm not the smartest guy in the world , so maybe fewer plays are better , " Dilfer said after throwing three touchdown passes in the victory . " You 're only going to call probably 40 in the game , anyway . " <p> Tight end Shannon Sharpe praised Billick for finally realizing he does n't have the same talent he had as Minnesota 's offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NFL scoring record . <p> " You have to give a guy credit because a lot of coaches fall victim to that , " Sharpe said . " They 've got a system , and it worked wherever they were before , and all of a sudden they bring their system and try to implement it even though they do n't have the players that made it work . They keep trying to do the same thing . <p> " I think Jimmy Johnson fell into that . He did n't have Emmitt ( Smith ) or Michael Irvin or Troy ( Aikman ) . He did n't have five Pro Bowl linemen , and all of a sudden he takes it to Miami and tries to run the same philosophy , and it did n't work . You have to do what 's best for your team and the players you have to implement it . If that means scaling things down , that 's what you do . " <p> Bad numbers - The Seahawks had 128 yards in their victory over the Chargers last week . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he coached the Packers , they never had fewer than 158 . In his ninth year , Holmgren has coached in 112 games . Only twice has his team gained fewer than 210 yards . <p> Historical night - Bengals owner Mike Brown on election night in the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore : " It 'll be the night you tell your grandchildren about , like the attack on Pearl Harbor , the day ( John ) Kennedy got shot . It will be the night nobody got elected . It will stick in your mind . " <p> Famous last words - The Steelers lost at Tennessee last week to break their five-game winning streak , but coach Bill Cowher told his players they 're going to win the rest of their games and finish 12-4 . <p> " Cowher came to us after the game and said we 're going to run the table , and that 's what we intend to do , " safety Lee Flowers said . <p> Cowher is desperate to avoid what happened to them the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Good company - The Steelers are within two quarters of tying an NFL record set by the 1976 Steelers . That Pittsburgh team registered five shutouts and did n't allow a touchdown for a record 22 consecutive quarters . Pittsburgh has gone 20 quarters without allowing a touchdown . . . . Opponents have been in Pittsburgh 's red zone 22 times , but they 've scored only three touchdowns , a percentage of 13.0 . The record is 31.6 percent , set by Miami last season . . . . In games decided by three points or fewer , Steelers coach Bill Cowher is 16-11 but only 3-7 over the last three years , including 1-3 this season . . . . The Jets have scored first once in nine games . They 've led at halftime twice . . . . Quarterback Vinny Testaverde has thrown eight of his 13 interceptions in the second quarter . . . . The Jets have started 12 players at free safety since 1995 . . . . Testaverde on winning : " Do n't tell me about the pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we do it . We just have to get it done . " <p> No-billed - In five seasons as Cleveland 's head coach and through nine games as New England 's head coach , Bill Belichick has a 39-52 record . . . . Even if the Browns lose the rest of their games and finish 2-14 , owner Al Lerner insists he wo n't fire president Carmen Policy , vice president of football operations Dwight Clark or coach Chris Palmer . " I 'm convinced they 're the right people , " he said . . . . The Browns are 2-8 . The Chargers are 0-9 . Cleveland had the first pick in the draft in each of the last two years . No team has ever gotten the top pick three consecutive years . . . . Last season , the Jaguars registered 57 sacks , tying them with the Rams for the league lead . After nine games , they have 15 sacks , tying them for 26th . Their leader is cornerback Aaron Beasley with five . . . . Dolphins safety Brock Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league , imitates an airplane after he makes a big play . He calls it his Goofy dance . " That 's for my kids , " he says .

" <p> <p> Running for the record books , by George <p> Titans running back Eddie George , who is nursing knee , ankle and foot injuries , ranks second in the AFC with 837 yards rushing . Entering today 's game against the Ravens , he has three 100-yard games and is on a pace for 395 carries , or 22 more than Earl Campbell 's season record . He 's coming off a 98-yard performance against the Steelers . <p> George 's recent performance is especially impressive when you consider that in the last three games he has faced the Ravens , Redskins and Steelers , all of whom are ranked among the top six defensive teams . <p> George was injured on the first series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ravens lead the NFL in defense ( 241.6 ) and run defense ( 65.9 ) . They have gone a league-best 27 consecutive games without allowing a 100-yard rusher . <p> <p> AROUND THE NFC <p> Kurt who ? - The Rams have lost two of three , but the losses ca n't be blamed on quarterback Trent Green . Subbing for Kurt Warner , who is out with a broken finger , Green has thrown for 1,021 yards , eight touchdown passes and two interceptions . His passer rating is 113.8 compared with Warner 's 111.6 . <p> In Sunday 's loss to Carolina , Green threw for 431 yards . He would have thrown for 510 , but a 79-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce was nullified by a penalty . <p> Center of attention - There has been talk recently about the Falcons being interested in trading running back Jamal Anderson . Anderson laughs off the trade talk . <p> " They ca n't trade me , " he says . " I 'm the entertainment . I 'm the personality . You love me or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I left , you 'd be like , ' Damn , Deion 's ( Sanders ) gone , Dre 's ( Andre Rison ) gone , Jamal 's gone . ' You 've got to have somebody you love to hate . " <p> Ricky 's numbers - Saints running back Ricky Williams has carried the ball 232 times , which puts him on a pace to break Jamal Anderson 's NFL record of 410 in 1998 . At his current pace , Williams would finish with 412 carries . Williams needs 93 yards rushing today to become the first Saints back to rush for 1,000 yards since Dalton Hilliard gained 1,262 in 1989 . <p> Bad-luck team - Good thing the Cowboys do n't have to play the Eagles again . Philadelphia beat them twice . Also , against the Eagles , the Cowboys lost receivers Joey Galloway and Rocket Ismail with season-ending knee injuries and lost safety George Teague for the season because of a broken foot . In 1999 , they lost they lost receiver Michael Irvin with a spinal injury and defensive end Greg Ellis with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brett Favre on his relationship with Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp : " I have a tremendous amount of respect for him as a man and as a football player .

Maybe they think I hate him . Maybe they think he hates me . If they do , they could n't be further from the truth . We 're good friends . It just so happens that for 3 1/2 hours on Sunday , it 's a heated rivalry . Warren likes to talk . He can back it up . I do n't like to talk much unless we 're up , and we have n't had that opportunity too much lately .

That 's the second-longest starting streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nedney 's kicked for five teams in five years , including the Broncos and Panthers this season . He 's connected on 24 of 27 field goals and could be voted to the Pro Bowl . He 'll be a free agent after the season because the Panthers will keep John Kasay , who missed the season because of knee surgery . . . . Quarterback Jeff George was the 19th player to start on offense for the Redskins this season . . . . In Tampa Bay 's last 16 games , cornerback Donnie Abraham has intercepted 13 passes . . . . Bucs cornerback Ronde Barber has 5 1/2 sacks . The league record for a defensive back is seven by Chicago 's Dave Duerson . . . . If the Saints defeat the Panthers , they will have a six-game winning streak for the first time since 1991 . They have n't won seven games since finishing 7-9 in 1995 . . . .

In 1999 , the 49ers set a team record for points allowed ( 453 ) . This season , they are on pace to surrender 517 . . . . From 1989 through 1998 , the 49ers were 54-14 in NFC West games . This season , they are 0-6 . They 've lost eight consecutive division games and are 2-12 over the last two seasons . From 1981 through 1998 , they were swept twice . They were swept twice last season and twice this season so far . . . . Redskins guard Keith Sims owns four Dunkin ' Donuts franchises in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .

" <p> <p> Even without Warner , Bruce ca n't be stopped <p> The Rams are being forced to play without injured quarterback Kurt Warner , but his absence has n't slowed his favorite receiver , Isaac Bruce . Warner 's backup , Trent Green , has developed an on-field rapport with Bruce , who has 56 catches and leads the NFL with 1,019 yards receiving . <p> In his seven-year career , Bruce has 6,847 yards receiving , which means he needs 153 to reach 7,000 . Bruce has played in 86 games . Barring injury , he 'll become the third-fastest receiver to reach 7,000 yards behind the Chargers ' Lance Alworth , who needed 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed 83 . Bruce will move past Sterling Sharpe , who reached 7,000 in 96 games . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55904 <p> ONE of the first things to know about Ray McCallum as he approaches the regular-season opener as the Houston Cougars ' new head coach this week is a combination of numbers . <p> He lets you know with obvious pride , " When we won the state tournament and went 27-5 my senior year , I did n't have 35 turnovers the whole year . " He does n't mention that he was also MVP of the Indiana state tournament that year ( 1978 ) , a determined and iron-willed point guard who refused to believe he could n't drive , cajole and floor-general his Muncie Central team to a second straight Indiana state championship . <p> Walking briskly through the UH Athletics/Alumni Center recently en route to practice , McCallum confided , " I hate to be late . " He wo n't accept his players being late to class , practice or a film session , missing a free throw or a simple layup or failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do and so little time , so many details to take care of , one of which any former point guard/coach like McCallum will pound into his new players ' consciousness - treasure the basketball . <p> " Seventeen turnovers a game ( the Cougars ' average last year ) is too many , especially if the other team is scoring 80 points a game , " he said . " We have to get better defensively and get some balanced scoring and try to turn Hofheinz Pavilion into a ' pit ' that other teams dread coming to play in and know they are going to have to fight for their lives to get out with a W. " <p> Certainly , that has been far from the case recently on the Cougars ' home floor - or anywhere else . In their four Conference USA seasons , the UH program that reached five NCAA Final Fours straggled in with an 11-50 C-USA record , 8-22 at home and a horrid 3-28 on the road . <p> Now 39 , McCallum already has been a Division I head coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two NCAA appearances . While his Ball State teams were 126-76 , the Cougars were 66-123 over the same seven seasons . Their most recent postseason appearance was the 1993 NIT , their most recent NCAA in 1992 . <p> When McCallum talks about expecting his players to play with " a passion for the game , " it is as if he is describing his formative years in the sport , the endless summer hours in the park , many of them spent playing the game with an older neighbor named Allen Leavell , who went on to a notable NBA career with the Rockets . After high school , McCallum would n't accept the fact that the Big Ten , then in an era of great backcourt stars like Magic Johnson , Isiah Thomas and Ron Lester , would not have a place for a 5-10 guard . <p> Finally convinced that hometown Ball State was the best place for him , McCallum soon was demanding of his coach , Steve Yoder , " You do n't think I can score , do you ? " Four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best senior player under 6 feet , setting the school 's career scoring record . <p> McCallum started his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Ball State , then joined Yoder 's staff at Wisconsin and remained there with Stu Jackson during a 10-year stint in which he recruited Michael Finley and Rashard Griffith . In one spring at Michigan with Steve Fisher , McCallum recruited Maceo Baston and current Rockets forward Maurice Taylor , then was hired as head coach at Ball State , which was under NCAA probation at the time . Two years later , the Cardinals won the Mid-American Conference tournament to earn an NCAA berth . Aided by Bonzi Wells , another McCallum recruit who broke McCallum 's school scoring record , the Cardinals won another NCAA and an NIT spot . <p> For this project at UH , McCallum , hired in April three weeks after Clyde Drexler 's sudden resignation , managed to retain two Drexler recruits - 6-8 power forward Patrick Okafor of Lee College and 6-9 center Alton Ford of Milby , the school 's first McDonald 's All-American since Rickie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophomore George Williams , C-USA 's No. 4 rebounder and a member of the all-freshman team last season , senior Chad Hendrick , guard Bernard Smith and junior-college point guard Dominic Smith . <p> Ford , who considered going elsewhere after Drexler left , now has lost about 14 pounds and substantial body fat ( from 13.9 percent to 10.3 ) after an intense preseason regimen with strength coach Michael Young , the ex-Cougar . <p> " Just do whatever it takes to bring the fans back and win , " Ford says about his approach to the season , which starts Thursday against Air Force in the BCA Classic at Wake Forest . " I have to run the floor harder and play harder all-around . " <p> McCallum cautioned , " He 's a freshman going against some of the best players in the country in this conference . We 're not looking at him to save the program . " <p> Okafor , rated the No. 5 power forward coming out of junior college by The Sporting News , is not a great leaper but has an instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big vertical jump ( 29 inches ) , " Okafor said . " I 'm a Dennis Rodman type . Any good rebounder can tell where to go to get the ball by the way it comes off the backboard . My goal is to be the conference Newcomer of the Year . " <p> In his first year out of Elkins , Williams averaged 14.3 points and 8.5 rebounds and shot 51.6 percent while starting all 31 games last season . Recruited by Drexler , Williams said , " We 're working a lot more on defense . Players get their intensity from the coaches . That was n't always there . I sensed it . It hurt us quite a bit . We were n't on the same page . It did n't have the same atmosphere . As a freshman , I did n't feel I had the right to speak up . <p> " You saw the season we had ( 8-22 , most losses in UH history ) . Not everybody was willing to work together , and that 's tough . Not everyone had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) resigned . I felt comfortable playing for him . <p> " Coach McCallum lets us know we ca n't do it without one another . It has to be together or we have no team . " <p> Hendrick was recruited by and started his UH career with Alvin Brooks as coach , then spent two seasons with Drexler and now McCallum as his third coach in four years . <p> " It 's a complete turnaround , another starting over , " Hendrick said . " Coach ( McCallum ) is a proven winner . Ray has been successful and proven he can win and knows how to establish a discipline .

With a change in chairman from Jack Rains to Billy Burge , and the absence of sports authority member Michael Stevens , with whom the team had negotiated before , Postolos did n't have a measure of his new would-be partners . <p> " The Rockets did n't trust us , and we did n't trust them , " Campo said . <p> But Postolos knew two things when the group first met in Burge 's office . Organized opposition had killed the previous deal , swamping the pro-arena message with its effective drumbeat of overtaxation . And the rancorous negotiating process leading up to the 11th-hour agreement in 1999 made voters feel something was suspicious about a deal hastily cut behind closed doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new negotiators spoke of building a partnership and have rarely been divided in public since , aside from two notable exceptions . <p> The other concern took more time , but the sports authority negotiating team , particularly Campo and Grover Jackson , soon began meeting with prominent opponents , most notably a key financier of the 1999 opposition , Chuck Watson , and its most prominent spokesman , Paul Bettencourt . What were their issues , they wondered , and how could they be resolved ? <p> Then Postolos played his first trump card . Instead of the deal the Rockets had negotiated in 1999 , in which the team and sports authority agreed to separately finance their shares of the arena 's costs , he wanted a deal consistent with that done for Enron Field and Reliant Stadium . In those deals , the sports authority entirely financed the projects in return for rent from the teams . <p> " Those were successful projects , " Postolos said . " People liked them , and they had good feelings about the team owners . " <p> <p> Campo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next sports authority move impressed Postolos . <p> It happened while Campo was vacationing in Utah . <p> While his family skied , Campo sketched his vision of the arena deal . Included was a number , $ 8.5 million , that the sports authority needed from Alexander each year to meet its financing commitments on the ballpark , football stadium and arena . <p> The sports authority said Campo 's numbers were as far as they were willing to go . <p> " Ric 's a uniquely skilled negotiator , " Postolos said . " He knows how to make a deal even under difficult circumstances , and these were difficult circumstances . " <p> For the next several months , the lawyers tweaked Campo 's deal as he , Jackson and a few others , now quietly joined by energy titans Ken Lay and Don Jordan , shopped the deal to former opponents and prospective allies . It was all good . <p> But then , in mid-July , the Rockets felt the deal slipping away . It was the partnership 's first real test . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone except for one issue : who picked the project 's architect . In such projects many of the public servants , in this case the sports authority board members , participate because it allows them some control over contract allocation . <p> Postolos wanted HOK Sports Facilities Group , whose Enron Field design had dazzled him on the ballpark 's opening night . Some sports authority members , particularly chairman Burge , were pushing for another Kansas City firm , Ellerbe Beckett . <p> That issue was resolved with HOK winning out as long as local firm Morris Architects got a large piece of the $ 12 million to $ 14 million contract . <p> At about the same time , it was becoming increasingly clear , if not widely publicized , that it would be untenable for the city of Houston , in addition to buying land for the project , to build a parking garage as well . <p> Postolos became concerned the sports authority was about to bring the garage back into negotiations , thus retrading the deal and perhaps adding considerably to the Rockets ' costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A ' done deal ' <p> Late on July 12 , Postolos called one newspaper and one TV reporter and told them the deal was done . <p> The " done deal " was news to the sports authority . Burge was in Los Angeles , and Campo was out of town on business as well . Jackson was vacationing in France . Later Postolos defended himself , saying he had to put a stake in the ground . <p> A close adviser to Mayor Lee Brown , Jackson helped douse the issue . Brown said he would have a difficult City Council battle to do the garage and needed a better deal for the city , Jackson said . To get what he wanted , Brown had to swallow some pride . <p> As last year 's negotiations unraveled , Brown stepped into the arena fray . Before Election Day it became his deal , and county Republicans stuck the urban Democrat with an embarrassing defeat . <p> To uphold its bargain this year , the sports authority obtained private financing to help build the garage . In return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for taxpayers than his deal in 1999 . Moreover , he had to lie low during the arena campaign to keep possible Republican opponents at bay . <p> " He did it , and it helped , " Jackson said . <p> <p> ' A mortal wound ' <p> As the garage issue was resolved , another tempest was stirred by a letter from County Judge Robert Eckels asking for changes to the deal . He accused the Rockets of " overreaching " in negotiations . <p> " If he was committed to stopping it , he could have done a lot of damage to us , " Postolos said last week . At the time , he called Eckels ' letter a " mortal wound . " <p> Campo , Jackson and other board members shook their heads . A complete overreaction , they said . It was a problem easily solved as part of the process . This was characteristic of whining by Rockets officials all along , they said . <p> " We were trying to make Lake Michigan boil , " said one sports authority member . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of work was beneath the surface , but once it got going it would be hard to stop . <p> " It was almost like George ( Postolos ) was throwing ice cubes in the lake . " <p> But by now , the lake was nearly boiling . Eckels ' concerns were addressed . As opponents of the 1999 deal were agreeing to keep quiet this year , Campo revealed another shocker . <p> He had spent months mediating between the Rockets and Watson , who wanted good terms for his Houston Aeros hockey team to play in the new arena . Alexander and Watson had previously swapped lawsuits . Theirs was not a warm relationship . <p> And yet , one day after the arena campaign kicked off in mid-September , Watson offered a ringing endorsement . He had secured a good deal for his Aeros , and there appeared to be no sizable opposition to the deal . <p> All the while , Postolos ' careful efforts to ingratiate the Rockets into Houston 's elite community were paying off . He worked with Ben F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate Kim 's Place , a facility for children with cancer and their families in honor of deceased Comets star Kim Perrot , at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center . <p> The broadly influential Lay and Jordan , as well as former Port Chairman Ned Holmes , were taking over the reins of the new campaign . Anyone standing in the way of the arena campaign - and few , if any , credible people were - would be mowed down . <p> " George did a hell of a job . He built the coalition that turned this around , " said his boss , Alexander . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55895 <p> Unless the truly unexpected happens - Oklahoma losing to both Texas Tech and Oklahoma State - the Big 12 South Division championship will not go through Texas for the first time in the five-year history of the conference . <p> Oklahoma 's 35-31 comeback win over Texas A &M; at Kyle Field on Saturday eliminated the Aggies ( 7-3 , 5-2 Big 12 ) from contention .

Oklahoma has taken control of the division across the Red River for the first time . <p> The Sooners , of course , have loftier goals than merely winning the Big 12 South . As the No. 1 team in the nation and in the BCS rankings , Oklahoma is taking steps toward becoming the Big 12 's first national champion since the conference was formed in 1996 . <p> Do n't put it past the Sooners , say the vanquished Aggies . Despite falling behind 24-10 in the third quarter and 31-21 midway through the fourth quarter , Oklahoma proved its mettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd to watch a football game in the state of Texas . <p> " It reminded me of the game when we were down 15 points to K-State ( the 1998 Big 12 championship game ) , the way they ( the Sooners ) kept fighting back , " said Texas A &M; guard Chris Valletta . " They stayed calm , cool and collected , like a No. 1 team should . What this tells me is that they certainly deserve to be the No. 1 team in the country . It was impressive . " <p> Added Aggies coach R.C. Slocum : " I credit Oklahoma for making the plays they needed to make to win . They did what is expected of a No. 1 team . Our hats are off to them . " <p> The Sooners most likely will play Kansas State in the conference championship game Dec. 2 at Kansas City . The Wildcats took control of the North Division by beating Nebraska 29-28 Saturday and can wrap up the North with a win over Missouri this week . <p> Should Oklahoma win the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would retain its No. 1 BCS rating and play for the national championship in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 3 . <p> With Nebraska 's loss to K-State , it appears the Big 12 would have only one BCS team if Oklahoma wins out . If Kansas State beats Oklahoma , the conference could end up with two teams in BCS games . <p> Kansas State would earn an automatic berth in the Fiesta Bowl as Big 12 champion , while Oklahoma could play in the Sugar Bowl against the Southeastern Conference champion ( provided Florida was n't in the Orange Bowl ) . <p> Seven Big 12 teams - Oklahoma , Kansas State , Nebraska , Texas , Texas A &M,; Iowa State and Texas Tech - are eligible for bowls . Assuming Oklahoma beats Kansas State in the championship game , the lineup for bowls could get interesting . <p> There is a chance Kansas State once again could be bypassed by upper-echelon bowls . The Cotton Bowl , which gets the first choice of Big 12 teams once the BCS makes its selections , might look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas A &M.; <p> The feeling is the Cotton Bowl would rather have Nebraska than Kansas State , even though Kansas State beat the Cornhuskers . If the Wildcats beat Missouri but lose to Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game , they would finish 10-3 . If Nebraska beats Colorado in its regular-season finale , it would finish 9-2 . <p> Then again , the Cotton Bowl could take Texas , which would finish 9-2 if it beats Texas A &M.; However , that would mark the third consecutive trip to Dallas for the Longhorns . The Cotton Bowl might want a fresh team , and Nebraska would fall into that category . <p> That could send UT to the Holiday Bowl in San Diego and set up an interesting choice for the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio . Would the Alamo Bowl rather have Texas A &M; or Kansas State ? The Alamo Bowl set an attendance record of 65,380 last year when the Aggies played Penn State . <p> Kansas State did n't make many friends in San Antonio when it lost to Purdue in the 1998 Alamo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger bowls and grumbled about being in San Antonio . In addition , the game attracted 60,780 . <p> Besides that , the Alamo Bowl would have justification for taking the Aggies , since they beat Kansas State 26-10 this season . <p> If the Aggies beat Texas in Austin the day after Thanksgiving , they likely would head to the Holiday Bowl . A &M; made a big impression on Holiday Bowl executives when it played in the 1990 game and was popular in San Diego due to that city 's large military presence . <p> Kansas State played in the Holiday Bowl last season , and the feeling among the game 's execs was that Wildcats fans travel in large numbers to bowls only when they are within driving distance , which San Diego is not from Manhattan , Kan . <p> There might be some support for the Aggies in Cotton Bowl circles if they beat Texas and finish 8-3 . The Aggies would own wins over both Kansas State and UT , and they played Oklahoma closer than anyone else has . Given a choice between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the Cornhuskers , who spent much of the season ranked No. 1 in the nation . <p> A more likely landing spot for the Aggies if they beat Texas is the Holiday Bowl . That would leave the Alamo Bowl with a choice of Texas and Kansas State , which likely would be a no-brainer in favor of Texas . <p> That means K-State could drop all the way down to the Insight.com Bowl , which has been moved from Tucson , Ariz. , to Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix . While it seems like a long fall for the Big 12 North champs , a similar situation developed in 1998 , when the Wildcats fell from a spot in the national championship game to the Alamo Bowl . <p> The bottom end of the Big 12 's bowl picture seems a bit more clear . If Oklahoma beats K-State and the conference has only one BCS team , that puts Iowa State in the Independence Bowl in Shreveport , La. , and Texas Tech in the inaugural galleryfurniture.com Bowl in the Reliant Astrodome . <p> The only bowls Baylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain stuffing , mashed potatoes and a green-bean casserole . <p> The Bears lost their 20th consecutive Big 12 game Saturday , falling 47-22 to Missouri in Waco .

Voters said it was easy to operate and gave quick and accurate tallies . <p> " I ca n't stress enough how little trouble we had with it , " said Vicky Stecklein , elections administrator for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very positive about it . " <p> The legal pad-size eSlate displays an image of a page of a ballot , which the user uses a dial to navigate . A voter puts the cursor on the name of a candidate , presses the " vote " button , then moves to the next race . <p> ESlate does n't allow more than one vote per race . If a spot is left blank , it will prompt a voter to make sure that is what she wants to do before allowing her to complete the ballot . <p> Voting results are stored in three locations - on the eSlate machine itself , on a memory device on a central control unit and on a removable storage device on that unit . Results can be sent from the precincts via modem to a central counting station or they can be printed out on-site . <p> Analysts warn that the technology itself wo n't solve the election system 's problems , however . <p> Lydia Volaitis , a research scientist with Washington , D.C.-based American Institutes for Research , says the lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palm Beach County voters do n't follow directions . <p> " You ca n't blame the users for something that 's poorly designed and improperly tested , " she said . " If you do n't properly test its usability , you are setting yourself up for failure . Major corporations do product testing every day , yet we do n't do it for one of the most important aspects of our society , our voting process . " <p> Voting technology in the United States has been slow to change , said Jerry Meadows , vice president of election solutions at Hart InterCivic . Paper ballots are still filled out and counted by hand in some rural areas , while 100-year-old lever technology is common in others . <p> The punch cards used in many jurisdictions , including Harris County , are based on 60-year-old IBM technology . Optical scanner technology has been used since the late 1970s . <p> Most states have guidelines for creating ballots , setting up voting stations and tallying votes , but how the guidelines are met can vary greatly , Meadows said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the most undercapitalized jurisdictions , such as school districts and county government , " he said . " They have to balance their election technology needs with whether or not to build a new jail or highway that year . " <p> Since elections are typically held once a year at most , seeking spending on voting technology can be an uphill battle . <p> " The attitude is that if what you 've got works , do n't fix it , " said Steve Raborn , elections administrator in Fort Bend County , where one of the eSlate machines was tested . <p> Hart InterCivic has printed election ballots for jurisdictions around the country for years but introduced the eSlate this past summer . <p> It is one of a handful of computerized balloting devices that voters are starting to use . Global Election Systems of McKinney , near Dallas , has developed a touch-screen system . Sequoia Pacific Voting Equipment of Exeter , Calif. , tested its touch-screen system in Riverside County , Calif. , this month . <p> Fort Bend did n't use eSlate for real voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters for candidates . <p> About half of the 1,700 voters who came to one Fort Bend precinct tried eSlate . They gave it high ratings on follow-up questionnaires , Raborn said . Blind voters , in particular , liked it . They used headphones to listen to the ballot choices as they moved the eSlate . <p> In Summit County , Colo. , the vote from the eight eSlate machines was tallied less than 10 minutes after the polls closed , Stecklein said . The optical scanner technology that the rest of the voters used took two hours to produce a count . <p> An eSlate unit costs about $ 2,500 , or $ 5,000 less than earlier types of electronic voting systems . <p> " I do n't think there 's a county out there that could n't back up the cost savings of these machines , " Stecklein said . " Compared to the cost of printing paper ballots and the time it takes to tally them , it 's not a hard argument to make . It could pay for itself in five to seven years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could prevent an embarrassing situation like that in Florida , she said . <p> A shortcoming of the eSlate machine is that its cost could limit the number of units a government could buy . That could mean longer lines at voting stations . <p> That is n't a problem with lower-tech methods . <p> " When you just have a piece of paper ballot to mark on , you can have as many people voting at one time as you have pencils , " Raborn said . " It takes more time to read them with the optical scanners , but we do n't get much TV coverage of our elections , so there 's no real pressure to get it done by 10 p.m . " <p> Technology by itself wo n't make the electoral process perfect , however . If technology is introduced without proper testing , it will simply eliminate some errors but create new ones , said Michael Wiklund , a director of the American Institutes for Research . <p> " When a user looks at a ballot , or the interface of an electronic voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from what is going through the mind of the designer , " Wiklund said . " It 's the kind of thing that needs to be approached professionally and methodically . " <p> Wiklund noted that a focus group " tested " the controversial " butterfly " ballot in Florida . But the ballot simply replaced one set of usability problems with another . <p> " I 'm not usually an early adopter of technology , but my gut says it 's a good way to go , " Wiklund said . " The concept of electronic ballots may intimidate some who 'd describe themselves as computer-phobic , but there are things we can do to lower that hurdle . " <p> Complaints about the readability of IRS tax forms reached such a fever pitch in recent years that the agency invested the time and money necessary to improve the design , he said . <p> " There just has n't been enough of a crisis to highlight the problem with improper testing of voting technology , " Wiklund said .

The voter pulls a lever to indicate a choice . A pulled lever automatically returns to its original position , causing a counter wheel within the machine to tally the votes . <p> History : The " Myers Automatic Booth " was first used in Lockport , N.Y. , in 1892 .

Their pleas are falling on deaf ears . <p> The Browns were 2-14 in their first season . After beating New England 19-11 on Sunday , they are 3-8 and just about guaranteed of not becoming the first team in history to get the top pick in the draft for three consecutive years . <p> The Browns actually feel today as if they clinched the playoffs . Based on the way northern Ohio fans celebrated Sunday , you 'd have thought they won the Super Bowl . All they did was defeat New England to end a seven-game losing streak . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and media so excited . It was beating their coach , Bill Belichick . <p> Belichick was the most unpopular coach in Cleveland Browns history . He presided over the 1991-95 era that signaled the end of the original Browns in Cleveland . It was n't his fault owner Art Modell moved the franchise to Baltimore . But with the exception of Modell , Cleveland fans and media hate Belichick more than any other figure in the franchise 's storied history . <p> Last week , Belichick played down his return to Cleveland . He pointed out that the team he coached and the stadium in which he coached were gone . But nothing Belichick said could erase the bad memories that linger from his regime . <p> Cleveland fans and media never liked Belichick 's personality . He was at a constant war with the media .

" <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE <p> No Billed - Bill Belichick has been called paranoid on more than one occasion . Sunday was a good example . He conducted a secret workout in the Patriots ' dressing room to see if quarterback Drew Bledsoe could throw well enough to play against the Browns . <p> Bledsoe , who was nursing an injured thumb on his throwing hand , threw passes of 15 and 20 yards in the locker room and convinced Belichick he could play . <p> " It 's a big locker room , " Belichick said .

They scored two touchdowns , kicked two of their three field goals and lost a fumble when they were going without a huddle . When they used a huddle , they did nothing but punt . <p> " I hope we use it more , " quarterback Peyton Manning said . " We seem to play better when we 're up-tempo . It 's always good to have it in your arsenal . " <p> When coach Jim Mora was asked about the possibility , he smiled and said , " I would expect to see it more .

A state judge promised a ruling sometime today . <p> Hanging in the balance is which candidate will win Florida 's 25 electoral votes and , most likely , will become the 43rd president . <p> Gore , who has avoided comment on the election outcome over the past five days , summoned reporters and photographers to the White House , where he called for " patience to spend the days necessary " to ensure a complete and accurate count of votes in Florida . <p> " What is at stake is more important than who wins the presidency , " Gore said . " I would not want to win the presidency by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't think Governor Bush wants that either . " <p> In Texas , Bush remained mum at his ranch in Crawford , but his spokeswoman in Austin blasted Gore for pursuing a recount that she insisted could not be fair or accurate . <p> " All week the vice president has said that Florida 's laws should be followed , " said Karen Hughes , Bush 's press secretary . " But today the vice president basically said we should ignore the law so he can overturn the results of this election . " <p> The initial vote count in Florida showed Bush with a lead of 1,784 votes , a margin that dwindled to fewer than 300 two days later after a machine recount of ballots as mandated by state law . <p> Gore leads in the nationwide popular vote by about 200,000 votes . In the Electoral College tally , which decides who wins the presidency , Gore has 255 votes and Bush has 246 . It takes 270 to win . Besides Florida 's disputed 25 votes , results in Oregon and New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 combined electoral votes would not be decisive . <p> When Florida 's vote totals shifted and voting problems were reported in some counties , Gore supporters asked for manual recounts as allowed under Florida law . The request was made in only four counties with Democratic voting majorities . <p> Bush and running mate Dick Cheney , who passed up the chance to make similar recount requests in heavily Republican counties , filed suit on Saturday , charging that a hand recount in just a few of Florida 's 67 counties is unconstitutional . <p> After a hearing Monday in Miami , U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks said he shares the Republicans ' " desire for finality " of the election , but he rejected Bush 's request to order an end to all hand recounting of Florida ballots . <p> " A federal court has a very limited role and should not interfere , " said Middlebrooks , who was appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton . <p> The Bush campaign is expected to decide today whether to appeal Middlebrooks ' ruling . <p> Meanwhile , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine on Monday increased the total votes for Bush , giving him a 388-vote lead over Gore , according to an unofficial tally by The Associated Press . <p> Late Monday , officials in Volusia County finished hand-tabulation of 184,339 punch-card ballots and about 30,000 absentee ballots . They declined to release the results from the county on Florida 's central Atlantic Coast , home to the Daytona International Speedway . <p> Elsewhere , officials in Broward County , where Democrats had hoped recounting ballots by hand would cut further into Bush 's lead , decided not to conduct a manual recount . A spot-check of 3,892 ballots from three precincts turned up no major problems and only four more votes for Gore . Democrats immediately vowed to go to court to overturn that decision . <p> In West Palm Beach , officials were pushing ahead with plans today to begin recounting 460,000 ballots by hand . <p> A hearing was scheduled for today in Miami for Miami-Dade County election officials to decide whether to comply with the Gore campaign request for a hand recount . <p> In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters living abroad are due by midnight Friday . Some of those already have been counted , and officials plan to tally the rest and add them to the recounted totals on Saturday . <p> In Tallahassee , the state 's top elections official , Republican Secretary of State Katherine Harris , met with lawyers for Bush and Gore , then announced that any recounting in the state 's 67 counties must end by 5 p.m. today . <p> " The electoral process is a balance between the desire of each individual voter to have his or her intended vote recorded and the right of the public to a clear , final result within a reasonable time , " Harris said . " The process of counting and recounting the votes cast on Election Day must end . " <p> Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher , who heads Gore 's legal team in the Florida vote fight , sharply criticized Harris and accused her of playing " partisan politics " instead of serving as an unbiased election arbiter . <p> " It is hard to understand why . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes that Floridians have asked to be considered , " Christopher said . <p> The deadline is a major concern for Democratic officials , particularly in Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties , where manual recounts are expected to take until the end of the week . <p> Harris said that counties not certifying their vote results by the deadline " shall be ignored . " <p> <p> At a glance <p> An unofficial count has George W. Bush leading Al Gore by 388 votes out of about 6 million cast in Florida . <p> A Miami federal judge denies the Bush campaign 's request to stop recounts in four Florida counties . <p> Broward County completes a hand recount of 1 percent of the ballots , then votes against doing a full manual recount . <p> Florida 's secretary of state refuses to extend a deadline today for manual recounts in the other three counties . <p> MORE COVERAGE : <p> Who 's paying for the recounts ? : Page 12A . <p> Austin firm says its system would have avoided the problems in Florida : Business . <p> <p> Counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering manual recounts of presidential votes already counted by machine . Barring successful legal challenges to the deadline , the counties have until 5 p.m. today to present their results . <p> VOLUSIA <p> Population 425,600 ; main city Dayton Beach <p> 184,000 ballots <p> County workers have completed manual recount of all but about 30,000 absentee ballots . <p> PALM BEACH <p> Population 1 million ; main city West Palm Beach/Palm Beach <p> 460,000 ballots . <p> Recounts begins today , and officials estimate it will take six days . <p> MIAMI-DADE <p> Population 2,175,000 ; main city Miami <p> Election officials having a hearing scheduled for this morning on whether to hand count some ballots . <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  <p> NOTES : Chronicle reporters Michael Hedges in Florida and John C.
