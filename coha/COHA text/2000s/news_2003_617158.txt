<p> High school athletes in metro Atlanta are safer this school year . <p> Since September , a majority of metro schools have raised money , publicly and privately , to buy defibrillators , and several schools have hired certified athletic trainers to monitor practices and games . In some cases , schools have changed travel policies to eliminate athletes from driving themselves and other athletes to practices and events . <p> The moves occurred largely in reaction to five Georgia high school athletes who died last year while playing , practicing or driving to events . <p> A Journal-Constitution survey completed this month revealed that 70 of 111 ( 63.1 percent ) metro schools purchased at least one defibrillator this year or plan to have one before the end of the school year . The devices , which cost between $1,800 and $3,000 , are used to restart the heart after a heart attack . <p> " Because of what happened , the schools determined it was important to have them , " Cobb County athletics director Clark Maggart said . " We encouraged the schools to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could save one life it would be well worth it . " <p> The survey also found : <p> * Ninety-five of the 111 schools ( 85.6 percent ) have a level of coverage by certified athletic trainers , professionals recognized by the American Heart Association , who are trained to prevent , recognize and evaluate injuries for immediate care . Twenty-three schools ( 20.7 percent ) have hired full-time trainers or increased their coverage at events since September . Last school year , only 43 percent of schools had certified athletic trainers on staff or provided one five days a week . <p> * Twenty-one schools added ambulance services at football games this season . In the 2003 season , 85 of the 111 schools ( 76.6 percent ) had ambulances at games . <p> * Nine schools ( 8 percent ) said they made changes to their travel policies to limit , or prevent , students-athletes from driving to practices and events . <p> The tragedies <p> In August of 2002 , Shai Owens , a 16-year-old cross country runner from DeKalb County 's Cedar Grove , died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctors say a defibrillator might have saved her life . <p> In February , Chattahoochee High football player Ryan Boslett collapsed and died during a workout at school . A defibrillator was available , but no one was trained to use it . Within 14 hours , Derrick Plankenhorn , a track runner at Southeast Bulloch High , also died of a heart condition in practice . <p> And in April , two golfers from Evans ' Greenbrier High were killed when the 17-year-old driver , Shane Williams , lost control of his SUV while driving to a golf match . Williams , and passenger Daniel Hall , 16 , were killed instantly . Two other teammates were badly hurt . <p> A Journal-Constitution three-part series , published Sept. 7-9 , examined policies that could have prevented the deaths . <p> Counties take action <p> Fulton County remains the only metro school system to provide defibrillators and training for its 11 high schools . Five Fulton County high schools , including Chattahoochee , now have three defibrillators on campus . <p> Maggart , Cobb 's athletics director , said nine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one defibrillator before the new year , thanks to private funding from parent-teacher associations , athletics boosters or school funds . <p> During the third quarter of Sprayberry High football games this year , cheerleaders walked through the stands , requesting donations for defibrillators . <p> " People gave generously , and the community has been behind it , " said principal Susan Galante , whose school raised enough money to purchase two . " You hope you never have to use one , but you sure like to have one on hand . " <p> Gwinnett 's school board passed a measure on Nov. 13 to allow all county schools to buy defibrillators and training with privately raised funds . All the schools plan to have at least one device in place by mid-spring . <p> Providence Christian , a private school in Gwinnett , purchased five defibrillators last month . <p> * Sprayberry raised money for its defibrillators through a sports medicine class , taught by the school 's certified athletic trainer , Nick DiGaetano . <p> He is one of a growing number of certified athletic trainers employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Burkhalter ( R-Alpharetta ) has been working with the Georgia Athletic Trainers Association and the Georgia Medical Association to devise a way to have volunteer certified trainers from local hospitals assigned to public schools across the state . It 's the GATA 's goal to have certified athletic trainers at all GHSA schools by 2006 . <p> Burkhalter plans to introduce in January the " Ryan Boslett Bill , " which would standardize pre-participation athletic physicals in Georgia and institute a system to teach parents , athletes and school officials the warning signs for sudden heart-related deaths . <p> DeKalb 's measures lead <p> DeKalb County has made the most changes . <p> After Owens ' death , Tucker football player Andrew Childers nearly died of a ruptured spleen while waiting 59 minutes for an ambulance to arrive at a DeKalb County game in September of 2002 . Doctors later told the family their son had been 15 minutes from death . <p> DeKalb County athletics director Charlie Henderson attended Owens ' funeral and visited her mother , Nicolette , afterward . She made him promise that DeKalb County would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> " The promise was that we would make things better and we have , " Henderson said . " We 're living up to it . " <p> DeKalb is accepting bids to purchase defibrillators for all 18 public high schools . Henderson said the school board is working with local legislators in hopes of getting a government grant to help pay for the devices . <p> Ambulances were at all DeKalb football games this season , and certified athletic trainers staffed every football game and all county cross country , wrestling , track , gymnastics and swimming meets . DeKalb County Superintendent Johnny Brown mandated that every coach , not just head coaches , be trained in CPR . <p> DeKalb also bought defibrillators for the county 's five stadiums , and they take defibrillators to all major county cross country , track , swim and gymnastics meets . <p> " What made us make the changes were the Journal-Constitution articles , " Henderson said . " We knew we needed all those things , but the way the articles raised awareness , it showed there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other changes come slowly <p> Some policies have not changed . <p> On Nov. 21 , Sandy Creek quarterback Dusty Bennett sustained a spinal cord injury while playing in a football playoff game . With only first-responders on hand , it took the ambulance 23 minutes to arrive at the Fayette County school . Doctors expect Bennett to recover fully , but he is still using a walker . <p> " You always want what 's best for your program , and you 'd think what 's best is having an ambulance right there , " Sandy Creek coach Rodney Walker said . <p> Schools also have been slow to change transportation rules . Of the schools polled , 91.9 percent still allow athletes to drive themselves by signing a waiver , even after warnings of insurance concerns from the Georgia High School Association . Athletes who do not use school-provided transportation take the risk of forfeiting millions from a GHSA insurance policy in case of catastrophic injury . <p> Two of the three Rockdale County schools , Salem and Rockdale County , said students may drive themselves but not other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Several Gwinnett County schools , including Berkmar , Brookwood and Grayson , allow student-athletes to drive but passed new rules to prevent them from transporting other athletes . <p> " If the transportation ca n't be provided , we allow students to be transported by adults , " Grayson athletics director Mike Phillips said . " But we do n't allow students to drive other students . " <p> ajc.com/highschool <p> * Read the original series online . A second survey of 111 metro schools reveal that many school systems have taken steps to make high school athletes safer . More than half of the schools have purchased defibrillators since the initial survey in August , and more than 20 schools have hired certified athletic trainers . ... Students School ...
