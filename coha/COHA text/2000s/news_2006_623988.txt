<p> Nearly a decade ago I was on a national trends panel in New York where experts were predicting Indian food would be the Next Big Thing . It was a logical leap and made perfect sense . After all , Asian Indians are a significant immigrant group in the United States , particularly in Silicon Valley , and our polyglot culture has developed a palate for the type of spicy , full-flavored foods characteristic of Indian cooking . <p> The trend started to come to fruition in New York at places such as Tabla , Devi and Spice Market , but it 's been slow to make inroads into mainstream dining in Northern California . <p> However , the newly opened Dosa in San Francisco 's Mission District has done what no other San Francisco establishment has been able to do  --  make Indian food trendy . It 's not just any style , but the less familiar and more searing cuisine of South India , which features crepe-like dosas and complex curries . <p> A meal at Dosa is elevated further by a well-executed wine list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean rice-based spirit that tastes similar to vodka . <p> Dosa owners Emily and Anjan Mitra are first-time restaurateurs , but have long dreamed of opening a restaurant that captures the excitement of Indian food . <p> They 've created a sophisticated interior in the space that has housed a number of restaurants , including Val 21 , 3 Ring , Le Crewe and Spiazzino . The 65-seat storefront is washed in rich tangerine , with nine elongated white pendant lamps evenly spaced in the rear of the dining room , giving visual interest and a mid-century attitude . It 's a setting that offers a clean , simple stage for chef Senthil Kumar 's interpretation of his native flavors . <p> Dosa represents an important step in mainstreaming and authenticating an important regional cuisine . Yet , several snobs on various Web sites lambasted this place soon after it opened in December , saying the food was n't " authentic " and the owner was from  --  big gasp  --  Bombay ( now Mumbai ) rather than South India . One blogger even trashed the place without trying the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A chef or owner does n't have to be from a particular culture to appreciate it ; often an outsider may have more respect for the indigenous cuisine than a native . Was Paul Bertolli raised in Italy ? Is Thomas Keller French ? <p> It 's what 's on the plate that counts , and the Mitras have created a restaurant that is contemporary and respects the traditions of South Indian food . <p> The challenge in introducing any unfamiliar cuisine to a wider audience is trying to find the balance of so-called " authenticity " while still making it accessible to novices . In that regard , the Mitras and Kumar do a superb job . The food might not be as fiery as you 'll find in Tamil Nadu , but for the most part it has a balanced heat . <p> The affable waiters and owners are usually around , willing to guide neophytes through the menu . To prepare for what 's to come , check out the Rasam " Fire Broth " ( $4 ) , a sinus-clearing concoction made with tomatoes , tamarind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some of the qualities of a consomme and a pleasantly sour , gently burning heat to acclimate the palate . <p> On Dosa 's menu , soup , which is often a second course in traditional South Indian meals , is followed by salads that are cooling but bland in comparison  --  whether it 's an expert mince of cucumbers , onions , carrots and bell pepper in a mild chile and lemon vinaigrette ( $7 ) , or heat-absorbing garbanzo beans with chopped onions , tomatoes and a light lemon dressing ( $7 ) . <p> Appetizers include dumplings made of steamed rice or fried lentils . A good introduction is the idli vada sambar ( $6 ) . Idli is a fermented rice dumpling that has a pleasantly dense texture , and vada is made of lentil flour and lightly fried . The two sit side by side in a sambar , a thick brown lentil soup flavored with tamarind and a complex mix of spices . An almost too-subtle coconut chutney comes on the side and does little to accentuate or cool down the main ingredient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $8 ) sauteed with a spicy sauce made with ginger , garlic , cashew paste , tomatoes , chile , coriander , cumin , cilantro and coconut milk , which smooths the flavors and allows the seafood to dominate . It 's one of the best calamari dishes I 've had in recent memory . <p> A large portion of the menu  --  a dozen entries  --  is devoted to the restaurant 's namesake , dosa . If asked for suggestions , the staff will steer diners to the masala ( $9 ) , a bronzed parchment-like crepe that even when folded over extends well beyond the rim of the plate . It 's stuffed with a spiced blend of mashed potatoes , onions and cashews . Great on its own , it 's even better when eaten the traditional way  --  dipped into the sambar then into the fragrant tomato or the mealy coconut chutney . <p> This section also includes the rava dosa , which is a thin , lacy crepe that 's made with semolina rather than rice and lentil flour . I particularly liked the rava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling , but the batter had thin slices of onions and fresh herbs pressed into it , making it look like delicate Japanese rice paper . <p> Another section of the menu is dedicated to uttapam , which has a pancake-like shape and texture made from a fermented batter of rice and lentils , and flavored with items such as farmer 's cheese and peas or onions , tomatoes and green chiles . Kumar 's version is a little gummy and tastes underdone . <p> Each of the four curries on the menu is distinctive . The chef 's skill really shows with the see-saw balance of the channa bhatura ( $13 ) , a chickpea stew that has a subtle sweetness that gently yields to a wave of chile-induced heat . It 's served with a big , puffy round of bread that is more than a foot in diameter . <p> Pepper chicken ( $14 ) , with hunks of meat still on the bone , consists of a rich sauce with a mild tobacco-like flavor spiked with crushed peppercorns and fresh ginger , while the lamb curry ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's spicy-sweet with caramelized onions , fennel , tomato and poppy seeds . <p> Prawn coconut masala ( $15 ) tastes almost like a Thai dish , mildly flavored with coconut , ginger , chiles , intensely reduced red onions , cashew paste and a spice blend with citric overtones that leads to a clean , refreshing finish . At first it seems almost too sweet , but the flavors have a cooling effect when eaten with the spicier dishes . <p> Desserts may not appeal to the Western palate , but they , too , cool things down , particularly the Indian ice cream called kulfi ( $5 ) ; gulab jamoon ( $4 ) , super-sweet fried milk balls that resemble doughnut holes saturated in a hot sugar syrup ; and rasmalai ( $5 ) , sweet ricotta-like cheese patties floating in a pool of cardamom-flavored sweet cream . <p> Despite the initial squawks of bloggers , Dosa has found an appreciative audience because of the fresh preparations , clean modern surroundings and helpful service . Even when there are hordes at the door , which is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborly , bringing the check and saying , " Take your time . " <p> However , guilt becomes a motivator to move as you see people packed around the bar waiting to experience the magic of what Dosa has to offer . <p> Wine , beverages pair nicely with cuisine <p> It 's not an easy task to match wine with the spicy cuisine of South India , but consultant Mark Bright has done an admirable job . <p> For one , he 's chosen 20 wines  --  more than half poured by the glass  --  that are n't too complex or oaky . The international selections are light , clean and bright such as the 2003 Ruffino Libaio Chardonnay ( $28 ) or 2004 Mark West Pinot Noir ( $7/$27 ) . However , markups are high ; most wines on the list retail for about $10 to $12 , and the least expensive is $24 for a 2004 Sula Chenin Blanc from India . The one bargain is the 2002 Mahoney Pinot Noir at $33 , which retails for around $24 and is about double the wholesale price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompaniment to Indian food , and Dosa offers seven , including three from India and one each from Germany , Scotland , San Francisco and Belgium . <p> Soju cocktails , made with the Korean distilled spirit , round out the beverage list . The five choices ( all $8 ) include one infused with lychee , another mixed with mango lassi and still another served up with a lemon wedge . <p> If you bring your own wine , corkage is $15.  --  M.B. <p> CHART : <p> Dosa 995 Valencia St. ( near 21st Street ) , San Francisco ; ( 415 ) 642-3672 .
