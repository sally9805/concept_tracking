Technology Headnote AUDIO Headnote Neoteric speakers are making audio systems a part of home decor . // If you think loudspeakers have to be big and boxy to deliver great sound , think again . The old look of hard-edged speakers with woodgrain cabinets has gone the way of break dancing and the Rubik 's Cube . These days , speakers come in all sorts of shapes and sizes-from flat to round-and in a rainbow of finishes . Whether used for home theater or hiphop , loudspeakers are definitely moving outside the box . You can credit home theater for the downsized speaker trend . When people realized that surround sound involved stuffing five speakers in the family room , they started demanding pint-size models with style . But it did n't stop there . These rules apply to traditional stereo speakers , too . Audiophile companies still require a big enclosure to move massive volumes of air , but they 're selling big and tall with a flair for fashion . Music Mimics Art Martin-Logan is one of the pioneers of speaker sculpture . The company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prop on " Friends " to a style statement on a credit card commercial . " There was a need in the industry to bring good design to high technology , " says Gayle Sanders , cofounder and president of Martin-Logan Ltd. , whose Odyssey speakers ( $6000 a pair ) are the latest in a long line of artful Martin-Logan speakers . The company calls the new style " high art , " which Sanders says refers to uncompromised engineering and industrial design . Martin-Logan speakers are built around a curvilinear electrostatic transducer , rather than the conventional tweeters and midrange drivers found in electromagnetic speakers . Music is reproduced when voltage is applied to a thin membrane sandwiched between two pieces of perforated metal . The membrane is exceptionally lightweight and fast , Sanders says , which results in a pure sound that 's low in distortion . So what has kept electrostatic designs from becoming the norm ? Managing charged partices is like controlling a lightning storm , Sanders explains . Electrostatic speakers can handle high-frequency sound down to about 200 Hz , but then a conventional woofer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass notes . Low E on a bass guitar is about a 20-ft. wavelength , Sanders notes . To reproduce such a long soundwave , huge quantities of air must be pressurized , and only a very rigid box can create the proper environment for that kind of sound  --  pressure level . Sport Speakers If the name TAG McLaren makes you think of sports cars rather than loudspeak- ers , you 're on the right track . TAG McLaren was the first company to use a composite material for automotive chassis 20 years ago , producing a very light but stiff and safe structure used for roadsters . The company has adapted that same rigid material to the loud speaker , giving its shape a fluid , sports car flair . Photograph MARTIN-LOGAN ODYSSEY Photograph MERIDIANAUDIO DSP8000 Photograph TAG MCLAREN AVANTGARDE F1 Photograph GALLO ACOUSTICS MICRO // " We 've designed a loudspeaker for those who wish to combine fine aesthetics with their listening pleasure . The target was to design a full-range loudspeaker which would also visually suggest an important element of musical expression , an almost dancelike quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TAG McLaren 's CEO . The free-form enclosure also enabled engineers to avoid diffraction problems resulting from sharp cabinet edges , which can affect the imaging of speakers . The curved shape-as opposed to parallel walls-largely reduces the possibility of standing waves that can occur when sound waves bouncing off parallel surfaces cancel each other out . The results , the company says , are exceptional imaging , spatial sound and transparency . The enclosure of a loudspeaker is the most expensive component of the product , accounting for as much as 70 percent of the total manufacturing costs . Since a stiff , dense material is required to minimize resonance , many speakers use a low-cost fiberboard for the cabinet . Designers of pricey high-end speakers can afford to use more expensive composite materials that can be molded to any number of shapes . TAG McLaren 's composites comprise various combinations of high-strength fibers , filler and binders made of various materials including Kevlar , carbon fiber , glass , metal compounds and polymers . " Composite technology offers the loudspeaker designer the freedom to design stiff , low-diffraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zucker says . The TAG McLaren AvantGarde F1 left and right speakers sell for $15,000 apiece . The sonically matched F1 center-channel speaker lists for $16,000 . MeridianAudio 's DSP8000 speakers ( $45,000 a pair ) are a testament to both engineering and aesthetics . The company 's engineering approach is built around active digital signal processing ( DSP ) technology . Inside each speaker are digital-toanalog converters , DSP processing circuitry and amplifiers , which keep the audio signal digital all the way to the amplifier stage . Since the amplifier is directly coupled to the speaker , Meridian says , the speakers have less signal loss and fewer unnecessary conversions from digital to analog . The result is purer signals . Digital signal processing also enables owners to adjust bass and treble levels without distorting the sound-as occurs when you boost the bass with analog speakers . In addition , you can adjust the speakers to compensate for room boundaries or acoustical properties . That 's important because the room can have as much effect on the sound as the loudspeaker itself . Meridi- an speakers face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonance that can color the sound . To stand up to extreme sound-pressure levels , Meridian has wrapped the DSP8000 speakers in a 1.5-in. - thick marine-grade plywood and steel casing . " You can play extraordinarily deep bass tones and put a glass of water on top of the cabinet , and the water wo n't move , " says Andy Regan , vice president of sales . The unique construction also allowed designers to pressure-bend the cabinet into a curved shape , which has both a physical appeal and the acoustical benefits of reducing coloration and eliminating standing waves . If $45,000 is a bit above your budget , Meridian has used trickle-down engineering to apply some of its high-end technology to more affordable speakers . The DS speakers list for $4500 a pair , and the analog M33 speakers are tagged at $2495 a pair . Before the home theater age , you would n't have seen anything like the tiny Gallo Acoustics Micro speakers - in. - dia. balls with a 3-in. driver inside . It 's not so much technological breakthroughs that have made the mighty mite possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifteen years ago , no one was making separate satellite/subwoofer systems , " he says . " They were making floorstanding speakers because no one needed to fit five speakers and a subwoofer into a room . " Gallo 's Micro Nucleus line is targeted to design-conscious consumers who need to save space , but the speakers have won rave reviews for their sound as well . Pellod promises that customers do n't get shortchanged on sound quality as a result of the attention to aesthetics . " The Micro is a classic case of form following function , " he says . The round Micro speakers also produce a wider sweet spot than conventional box speakers , which means you do n't have to find a single , precise location to gain the imaging and sound stage you want from a loudspeaker , according to Pellod . Gallo uses a plastic insulation material inside the speakers rather than fiberglass . Pellod says the proprietary material provides a denser environment inside the speakers , which allows for more output than most 3-in. drivers can pump out . The Micro stereo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive subwoofer with an 8-in. driver . The home theater version ( $1500 ) packs five Micro satellites and a 150-watt powered subwoofer with a 10-in. woofer . The speakers come with isolation rings so that you can place them on shelves . Home theater also has created the need for speakers with specific functions in a surround-sound setup . The center-channel speaker has proved especially difficult for consumers to accommodate , since it must go directly above or below the TV to anchor the dialogue to the characters on the screen . Infinity 's Modulus home theater system ( $1699 ) , a speaker package combining five speakers and a 300  --  watt subwoofer , has addressed that problem with an optional , adjustable TV bracket that holds the left , center and right speakers and fits on top of TVs with diagonal screen widths of 30 to 55 in . " We found that consumers were buying a home theater speaker system with the intention of buying stands or a cabinet later on , " says Eli Harary , brand manager for Infinity . " What ended up happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right speakers on top of the TV . " Without a certain amount of separation , he says , you wo n't get the full effect of a soundtrack . The sound of a car traveling from the right to the left side of the picture wo n't have the same sweeping effect as it does when the sound clearly travels from speaker to speaker . Each room presents its own acoustical idiosyncrasies , which the Modulus system addresses . The system sports Infinity 's Room Adaptive Bass Optimization System , which lets you compensate for low-frequency room resonances and optimize the bass for a particular space . Cheap And Pretty If four-figure sticker prices are too much for your wallet , there are less expensive speakers to consider . JVC has ushered in a new look for minisystem speakers . The aluminum FS  --  SD 1000 ( $500 ) features a sleek CD/ amp/tuner flanked by a pair of cylindrical speakers and a separate subwoofer . JVC says the " stick " speakers provide a wider sound field than most box speakers . In fact , the neodymium magnet used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker magnets , which contributes to a 360 deg sound field , says Rich Mirrer , JVC national product specialist . " No matter where you are in the room-even if you 're behind the speakers-you get the same crisp sound as when you 're standing in front , " he says . The new speaker designs mean you do n't have to compromise sound quality for good looks . So , when you 're shopping for speakers , take a good look and a listen .
