<p> It 's probably a safe bet that no family will be affected more severely by the closure , merger or relocation of 14 San Francisco schools than the nine-member Baker clan of the city 's Western Addition . <p> Their lives revolve around John Swett Elementary , which the school board voted to close at the end of this school year . Mom Anitra works as a parent liaison , dad Dawayne monitors the yard and coaches basketball , and seven of their children either attend the school or have graduated . <p> The family runs two after-school groups for Swett students , the Get Along Club and the Little Sisters with Soul , and leads a dance troupe and choir there , too . <p> " It 's not just a school  --  it 's a home , a home away from home , " Anitra Baker said Friday morning , hours after the Board of Education 's vote . She and her husband expect the closure to hurt not only their children 's education but also their income because both work at the school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , " Anitra Baker said . <p> The vote late Thursday , after weeks of intense debate and lobbying , left families across San Francisco reeling as they tried to map out their future without the schools they 're accustomed to . But , as painful as the cuts are , parents should brace for more . <p> The district still faces major budget troubles next school year . This year , the general operating budget  --  the money used for teacher salaries , classroom supplies and other basics  --  is $327 million , a figure expected to grow by $2.5 million with a little more financial help from the state . Still , district officials say they 'll be short millions , though they do n't yet know the precise sum . <p> The decisions made Thursday will save the district $2.4 million  --  just half the school board 's goal . The moves also will enable the district to lease two buildings that will be made vacant by the relocation of schools , and the district hopes that will bring in an additional $4.7 million . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add great uncertainty to the budget forecast . The district is offering teachers a 7 percent raise over 18 months , while the union 's offer is 10 percent over two years plus a 1 percent , onetime bonus . <p> The teachers have n't had a raise in 3 1/2 years . <p> While the two offers sound fairly close , they would have very different financial outcomes for the school district . The district 's proposal would mean cutting an additional $2 million for next year , while the union 's proposal would mean cutting an additional $18.5 million next year , according to Myong Leigh , the district 's chief of policy and planning . <p> Dennis Kelly , president of the teachers ' union , said Friday he does n't think teachers will agree to a raise of less than 10 percent . Many plan to gather today near City Hall to hold a " Grade-In for Justice " where they will grade papers on the street to show how hard they work and that they deserve a raise . Teachers affected by the closures and mergers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board members agreed Friday they will have to consider major cuts in many areas , including preschool , busing , nutrition , special education , central office administration and the amount of money sent to each school for salaries and classroom supplies . <p> " You name it , it could be on the table , " said board member Dan Kelly . " All those things are competing for the same dollar , and the dollars are inadequate . " <p> Board members and district officials said Friday they want to ensure that the children affected by the closures , mergers and relocations will get a better education than they do now . Several said that students at schools that were closed or merged will be served better by attending a full school with more resources . <p> The district is sending letters to all affected families to explain the decisions , give their children first priority in school assignments for next year and hold counseling sessions for them . <p> But , according to some families at those schools , those efforts are too little , too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese Bilingual Bicultural Program , which is in the Outer Sunset but is to merge into Rosa Parks Elementary in the Western Addition . <p> Morone lives four blocks from the current school and said she will not send her son , Elijah , to Rosa Parks as the district intends . From what she 's heard from other families , 60 percent of them wo n't send their kids there , either . <p> " Everyone was crying  --  there were just tears upon tears upon tears , " she said of the school scene Friday morning . " People feel so betrayed . " <p> She said it does n't make sense either for students in the Japanese bilingual program or Parks kids to be merged together and that her family will consider private schools for next year . <p> In last year 's smaller round of school closures , the district lost 15 percent of the students affected , according to Leigh . Those students either went to private schools or moved out of the city . District officials say they hope to lower that percentage through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some families said they would n't go along with the district 's planned merger of their students and teachers into John Muir Elementary , a mile away . <p> Many students come from families that do n't have cars and walk to Swett from the Tenderloin , Civic Center and Western Addition . They would have to walk an additional mile to get to Muir  --  past three housing projects , according to Dawayne Baker . <p> The Bakers perused Craigslist on Friday to see if they can afford to rent a home in Sacramento . They live in a housing project and said that if they ca n't move out of the city , they will home-school their children . They said the other families they 've talked to at the school wo n't send their children to Muir , either . <p> " It 's wrong , " said their fifth-grade daughter , Dianna , an aspiring veterinarian . " They ( the school board ) want to just get more money . They should be thinking about all the children and how it 's going to change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teachers at Swett , too , are dismayed by the decision . Elizabeth Fortier , a first-grade teacher who has worked at the school for six years , said she worries Swett 's extensive art program could be lost in the merger . She said Muir 's teachers also use a scripted curriculum to teach reading and that she does n't think Swett teachers will go along with it . <p> " Teachers are devastated  --  it 's completely unjust , " she said . <p> Ida Mae Stanford has worked as an aide at the school for 30 years . She was active in the civil rights movement and said it 's time for the African American families in the Western Addition to stand up for their school and protest the decision to close it . <p> " This is taking me right back to 1963 , " she said . " I will not give up until students have the right to their education  --  I will never give up .
