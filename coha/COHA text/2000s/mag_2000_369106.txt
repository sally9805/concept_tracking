Well , we were sorta kinda pretty sure we had a winner for a while . Now it 's less clear . That 's O.K. We can still get on with our lives . Here 's a look at four taxing matters likely to come under the microscope for either Bush or Gore . Forget the big stuff . After such a bitterly contested election and with an evenly split Senate and a narrow G.O.P. majority in the House , neither candidate will get anything close to what he wants . Heck , he wo n't be able to pick out a pair of pants without a fight . <P> On a grand scale , that 's not so bad . A do-nothing Congress wo n't blow the budget surplus , leaving it for debt repayment , which would put downward pressure on interest rates and provide a backdoor tax cut . That 's the gridlock benefit you hear so much about from Wall Street . But it 's a mistake to think nothing will happen , especially if Bush prevails . He ran on the promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , " says political analyst Andy Laperriere at ISI Group . <P> Doing so may not be as tough as some expect . The economy is slowing , so a new Congress will be more inclined to provide some kind of stimulus . And the projected 10-year surplus of $4.6 trillion , including Social Security funds , could jump $1 trillion ( new estimates are due next month ) . That would leave more room for tax cuts . <P> No matter who wins , the focus will be on measures that have enjoyed bipartisan support . The main ones : reducing the estate tax , eliminating the marriage penalty , expanding IRA and 401(k)-plan savings . Further down the list is fixing the horribly crafted alternative minimum tax , or AMT . <P> If I had my way , the AMT would be first up . Enacted in 1986 to make sure the rich do n't dodge taxes by taking big deductions for such things as investment expenses and second mortgages , this tax now soaks even the middle class . Next year 1% of all tax filers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Many AMT victims earn well under $100,000 a year . By 2010 , 10% of filers will pay the AMT , a complicated tax that effectively takes back deductions for Everyman expenses like state property and income levies and medical care as well as personal exemptions for children . The central issue is that the trigger point for the AMT does n't rise with the cost of living . Look for that trigger to be indexed to inflation . Full repeal probably is n't in the cards . <P> That 's true of the estate tax as well . A bill to kill it got as far as the President 's desk this summer . But the measure has come under increasing fire as a break for the very rich . Relief may come in doubling the lifetime exclusion to $2 million by 2006 , with additional exemptions for farmers and small-business owners . The top " death-tax " rate of 55% may also be cut , possibly to under 40% . This would be a fun battle to watch . Those who favor repeal do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay it , support for repeal erodes . <P> The limit for annual contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA could be raised from $2,000 to $5,000 and for 401(k) plans from $10,500 to $15,000 . There 's a decent chance that the income ceiling to be eligible for a Roth ( $160,000 per household , $110,000 for singles ) would be indexed to inflation .
