Iowa may have only seven electoral votes , but in a tight contest , it 's an important battleground . ( Al Gore won the state in 2000 by less than 1% . ) So residents of Davenport were hardly fazed when PRESIDENT BUSH and JOHN KERRY showed up for rallies on the same day , just blocks apart . The crooks in town were n't fazed either . With the cops preoccupied , three banks were robbed .
