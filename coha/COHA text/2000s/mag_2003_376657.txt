Ghosts are what history sends to remind the living that it is not done with us . This fall the shades of the 1980s have been lurking in the cobwebbed corners of America 's pop culture : Michael Jackson , staring from his mug shot like a revenant ; Ronald Reagan , whose culture wars CBS exhumed with its planned , then canceled mini-series . But these were only minor hauntings compared with what will happen on Sunday , as Angels in America ( HBO , Dec. 7 and 14 , 8 p.m . E.T. ) sends the ' 80s crashing into American homes with a fanfare of hosannas and portents of pestilence and apocalypse . <P> Set mostly in 1985 and 1986 and adapted by Tony Kushner from his pair of Tony-and Pulitzer-prizewinning plays , Angels is equal parts domestic drama , agitprop and Scripture . It follows two New York City couples : Prior Walter ( Justin Kirk ) , who is sick with AIDS , and his lover Louis Ironson ( Ben Shenkman ) , who abandons Prior , unable to cope with his illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary-Louise Parker ) , a closeted gay Mormon lawyer and his disturbed , pill-popping wife . Around them orbit historical and mythological figures : Roy Cohn ( Al Pacino ) , the diabolical former aide to Senator Joseph McCarthy who is gay , closeted and stricken with AIDS ; the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg ( Meryl Streep ) , whom Cohn , by pulling strings , got executed for treason ; and an angel ( Emma Thompson )  --  the spiritual avatar of America . When she smashes through the ceiling of Prior 's apartment to draft him as an unwilling prophet , all hell breaks loose  --  or , really , terrifyingly , all heaven does . <P> If the ' 80s of Angels seem a lot like today  --  ideological warfare , sexual politics , a sense of the end times  --  it 's no surprise to Kushner . " We have this idea that we cycle through political moments very rapidly , " says Kushner . " But they last a long time . Angels was written about something that was alive and kicking , the Reagan counterrevolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're still living in the late ' 80s . " <P> Bringing his work to TV was no comedown for the playwright , who is unapologetically " addicted to television , " including HBO 'S The Wire , The Honeymooners and " Law &; Order : Sexual Filth " ( his nickname for Special Victims Unit ) . In a sense , Angels was TV waiting to be made , an HBO drama before HBO dramas as we know them existed . Director Mike Nichols ( The Graduate , Wit ) notes that the plays often cut between split-stage scenes , a " very filmic " technique . " So much of it concerned dreams and magic , " Nichols adds , " and those two things are very much in the realm of movies . " <P> Nichols , Kushner and HBO all call Angels a movie ( it will debut in two parts as it did onstage but will be rerun in one-hour episodes and in one six-hour shebang ) , but its high-literary and low  --  pop culture sensibility  --  it references Hegel and The Wizard of Oz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Singing Detective 's Michael Gambon even shows up as , of course , a ghost . ) And it ranks in TV history with Potter 's masterworks . The key to Angels is that it is realistic and fantastic at once  --  a miraculous event in mundane circumstances , like a biblical visitation  --  and Nichols ' movie-series is appropriately epic and gritty . He can as capably bathe a scene in heavenly light as in HIV-tainted blood .
