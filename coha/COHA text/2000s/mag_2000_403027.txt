Nine Ways to Winterize Your Pet When temperatures drop , a fur coat is n't enough to keep him warm and safe <p> At the start of every winter , I get numerous telephone calls and e-mails from concerned owners asking how they can best protect their pets from extreme cold , exposure to the elements , and other hazards of winter . For the most part , if you take the same precautions for your pets that you would take for yourself , they 'll be fine . Here are the most important things for you to remember : Put on a sweater . Although dogs and cats are equipped with fur coats , they vary in thickness and ability to keep the animal warm . What 's more , at the beginning of cold weather , most coats are just starting to thicken up again from the natural thinning process that takes place each summer . It usually takes a few months after the temperature drops for them to offer real protection . Some animals may never develop an adequate winter coat , though . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either bring him in or bundle him up with a sweater . Frost-bite or hypothermia ( a potentially deadly condition in which the core body temperature drops dangerously ) can develop if unprotected pets are left in the cold too long . Give ' em shelter . If your dog or cat lives outdoors most of the time , he needs a warm , protected shelter he can easily get to . Make sure your dog has a draft-proof doghouse . Keep it elevated a few inches off the ground and filled with nonabsorbent bedding ( such as hay ) . For felines , install a cat door to the basement or barn . ( If you do have an outdoor cat , make sure you check under the hood of your car before starting up in the morning . Car engines are a favorite but dangerous warm spot for outside cats . ) When the temperature drops below 20degreesF , however , it 's best to bring your pets inside . Keep the water flowing . Electric warming devices can keep your outdoor pet 's water supply from freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time outdoors in cold weather burn more calories to keep warm . Therefore they need to eat more . If you have a pet that enjoys being outside in the winter , make sure you increase the amount you feed him by 25 to 50% . Protect his paws . Ice-melting chemicals and salt can be very irritating to a dog 's footpads . Make sure you rinse and dry your dog 's feet after every walk . Ice balls often form in the hair between a dog 's toes and can lead to frostbite . Checking his paws regularly and trimming the hair between his toes ( with blunt-ended scissors ) will prevent this . Beware of dangerous chemicals . Antifreeze is extremely toxic to both dogs and cats-drinking even a few drops can be fatal . The trouble is , its sweet aroma seems to attract pets . If you suspect that your dog or cat has ingested antifreeze , call your veterinarian immediately . To prevent accidental poisoning of animals , use animal-friendly antifreeze that contains propylene glycol . Pet-proof your fireplace . Although fireplaces and portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can be dangerous . Letting your pet get too close to flames or other heat sources can singe fur or even cause severe burns . To protect your pets , make sure that your fireplace is equipped with a screen and that your portable heaters are in rooms where your pets ca n't get to them . Keep him dry . If your pet 's coat gets wet , it will make him colder , so keep some old towels on hand , and dry him off frequently . If he 's already chilled , throw the towels in the dryer , then wrap him in them while they 're still warm . Be sure to wrap the towel around his chest and abdomen to keep his vital organs warm . Baby him . Puppies , older pets , and animals with illnesses are much more sensitive to the cold . Make sure that you limit the time they spend outdoors in cold weather . And do n't leave these pets in a car in very cold weather for long periods of time either-it does n't offer as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thin Ice <p> Frozen ponds can be deadly to both strolling dogs and people . Unless a pond is posted as safe , never allow your dog to walk across it . Holiday Hazards <p> While it 's tempting to include your pet in the holiday festivities , some human practices can be as dangerous as if you left your pet out in a blizzard . Here 's a heads up : The rich foods that abound during the holidays can wreak havoc on your pet 's intestinal tract . If you must give him a treat , morsels of low-fat turkey breast , carrots , and green beans without the trimmings should be okay in small quantities . Keep the brownies and chocolate chip cookies out of reach . Large amounts of chocolate , especially baker 's chocolate and chocolate chips , can be toxic to your pets . Although your dog or cat may have fun playing with tinsel , they also like to eat it , resulting in intestinal obstructions . Hang it high so your pets ca n't get to it . Some holiday plants can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can cause uncomfortable symptoms . Keep holly , mistletoe , and poinsettia plants well away from them . A high volume of holiday visitors can be very stressful for pets , resulting in bites and scratches and other antisocial behavior . Unless your pet is used to the holiday hubbub , keep him separate from your guests . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Exercise your pooch in winter , but exercise caution when you do . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Check his paws to prevent this winter danger <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Resist the temptation to give your pet rich table treats . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Amy Marder <p> By Amy Marder , VMD , Clinical assistant professor at the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and vice president of Behavioral Medicine and Companion Animal Services at the ASPCA Headquarters in New York City <p> Adapted by VMD <p>
