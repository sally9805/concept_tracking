THEY CAME AS THE SUN disappeared and the sky turned from blood red to deep violet-blue and the stars came to life with a hard and shiny light . They arrived in gyro-pods , dropflyers , and humjets , and some even in armored ground vehicles ( adding an extra edge of excitement to the evening ) , emerging from the nearby ruins with headlights marking the way along roads no longer maintained , entering the heavily manned ecurity station , then finally passing with a shimmer through the encrypted energy barrier to park on the cleared lot of crushed shells just outside the transparent walls of the natatorium . <p> The Samarra Natatorium stood at the edge of the sea , surrounded by the ruins of a once thriving neighborhood that had been forsaken some decades earlier . A quarter mile to the north , a muddy river flowed into the sea . The natatorium was an extensive complex of interconnected swimming pools , spas , and rejuvenation ponds fed by thermal mineral springs , all enclosed in a structure built of faceted steelglass . Eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathe in the warm waters believed to have antiaging and aphrodisiac properties , or simply indulge in alcohol and narcotics and socialize with their peers throughout the long and sweltering nights . During the week , three or four hundred would come each evening , but on Friday and Saturday nights more than a thousand men and women would crowd in and stay until dawn . It was the place to make one 's appearance that summer-it was the place to renew acquaintances , the place to meet new people , the place to eat and drink too much , the place to indulge appetites of all sorts . That summer , it was the place to be . <p> As night fell , McDermott approached the natatorium on foot , alone and unarmed . The bioluminescent glow from the structure 's interior spread throughout the nearby ruins , casting unnatural shadows but providing enough illumination for him to make his way among the wreckage of deserted buildings , abandoned streets and alleys , derelict cars and mounds of stinking garbage . An electric buzz of insects saturated the hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or piercing caw from birds in the upper reaches of the run-down buildings around him . <p> Stinking garbage ? McDermott nodded to himself . Perhaps the ruins were n't quite as abandoned as they appeared . When he stopped and looked away from the natatorium and intently studied the buildings , he could make out faint gleams of light in some of the windows , and when he breathed slowly and deeply he could smell hints of cooking food cloaked by the stench of the garbage . <p> From the edge of the ruins , he watched the stragglers arriving by air and land , and studied the wide sterile buffer zone surrounding the natatorium grounds , the energy barrier , and the security drones hovering in the airspace above . He moved from building to building , keeping to the harsh shadows , coming around from south to north so he could view the resort from all angles . Through the semitransparent steelglass he could see the blurred images of people moving in an insectlike mass , and the large globes of bioluminescence suspended from the ceilings , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As the Moon rose , he discerned in the distance a lean figure sitting by the riverbank , fishing . McDermott watched the figure for a time , then emerged from the shadows and walked across an open stretch of sand and grasses toward the river . As he neared the river , the figure turned . <p> It was an old man , dark skinned with short white curly hair and a sparse white beard ; he sat on a wooden stool and held a homemade fishing pole in both hands . The man seemed unconcerned and calmly watched McDermott approach . McDermott stopped a few feet away and greeted him . <p> " Good evening , " the old man said . <p> " Any luck ? " McDermott asked . <p> The old man leaned forward , picked up a chain staked to the ground beside him and raised it out of the water . One tiny silver-streaked brown fish hung limply by its mouth from a closed loop of wire . " Oh , yes , " the old man said with a smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water with a quiet splash . <p> McDermott stepped closer and they shook hands and introduced themselves . The man 's name was Samuel Latu and he 'd been fishing since dusk and would probably be there all night . It was too hot during the day for the fish , which apparently napped while the Sun beat down on the water . So he fished at night . <p> " A man has to eat , yes ? " Samuel said . <p> McDermott nodded toward the glowing natatorium in the distance . " They eat just fine . " <p> " Yes , " Samuel replied . " I am not one of them , however , so I 'll just stay here for a while . And you ? " he asked . " Are you one of them ? " <p> " Do I look like one of them ? " <p> " Yes and no , " the old man said . He cocked his head , studying McDermott . " I think you ware one of them once - a man of prestige and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way . " <p> " That 's an interesting notion . " <p> He shrugged . " It 's just a guess . " <p> " Do you watch them much ? " McDermott asked , nodding toward the natatorium . <p> " I watch them come and I watch them go . There is a kind of beauty to their vehicles in the air . What they do inside , however , is ridiculous and of no interest to me. " he rested the fishing pole in a makeshift holder driven into the ground beside him , and took a single cigarette from his shirt pocket . " This is the last , or I would offer you one . " <p> " I do n't smoke , " McDermott said . <p> " Ah , better for both of us . " He lit the cigarette and smoked in silence for a time . " Why are you out here ? " he asked with a raised eyebrow . " Taking the air ? " <p> McDermott chuckled . " I have n't heard that expression in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever actually heard it . Read it , more likely . " He nodded . " Yes , just out for a stroll . " <p> Samuel turned and jerked his fishing pole , then waited several moments before shaking his head . " Nothing . " <p> " I 'll leave you to your fishing , then , " McDermott said . " Good night . " <p> " Good night , " the old man replied . <p> McDermott turned and walked back toward the ruins . <p> TWO NIGHTS LATER , well after midnight , he returned carrying a rucksack with two packs of cigarettes , sandwiches , and coffee . The natatorium was aglow , its light reflecting from the listless waves that washed up the gentle slope of beach . He spotted the old man on his stool at the same bend in the river , and walked out to join him . <p> " Luck any better tonight ? " McDermott asked . <p> " Worse , " Samuel answered . <p> McDermott opened the rucksack , took out the cigarettes and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then looked up at McDermott . " What do you want from me ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> Samuel regarded him thoughtfully , then said , " Why do I believe you ? " <p> " Because it 's true . " <p> " That must be it . " <p> McDermott dragged over a driftwood log from nearby and sat on it beside the old man . He brought out the sandwiches and they shared them as they watched the river and the tip of the fishing pole , which never moved . When he brought out the coffee , Samuel nodded appreciatively . <p> Samuel sipped at his and murmured , " This is very good . " <p> They drank coffee , and Samuel smoked cigarettes and talked while McDermott listened . Samuel was eighty-three years old and lived on the second floor of a derelict townhouse just on the other side of the low dunes , with a view of the ocean and the natatorium . Three other families and a few other singles like himself lived in the townhouse complex , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No electricity , sewage , or running water , of course , but otherwise more than adequate . He had lived there for thirteen years , ever since his wife died . No children . There was family on the East Coast he had n't seen in twenty years , and family back in the Sudan that he had never seen , or could n't remember - he had come to the United States when he was fourteen . <p> " And you ? " he asked McDermott . " Where do you live ? " <p> " Nowhere for very long . " <p> " Family ? " <p> McDermott just shook his head . He did n't want to talk about family , he did n't want to talk about himself at all . Samuel seemed to sense and accept that , and asked no more personal questions . <p> Sometime later , Samuel caught a large rainbow trout with several cauliflower-like growths near its tail . <p> " Is it safe to eat ? " McDermott asked . <p> Samuel coughed out a laugh . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . But I 'm an old man , so it ca n't matter much . I 'll eat it . " <p> Near dawn , he caught another fish , smaller but completely normal in appearance . " You 've brought me luck , " Samuel said . <p> McDermott stood and shouldered the rucksack . " I need to go . " <p> " Thanks for the cigarettes and the company , " Samuel said . " Both are appreciated . " <p> A dropflyer flew overhead , continued out over the ocean , then swung around , headed back in toward the natatorium to pick up passengers it had presumably dropped off early in the evening . <p> " Entertainment 's over , " McDermott said . <p> " It 's never over for them , " Samuel replied . <p> Watching the dropflyer land , and figures emerging from the bright lights of the natatorium to stagger toward it , McDermott said , " We 'll see . " <p> Posing as a management recruiter from out of town , McDermott frequented Financial District restaurants and cafes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early evenings . It took most of the week , but he finally managed an invitation to join a small party of corporate attorneys who were going to the Samarra Natatorium that weekend . At nine o'clock Saturday evening , as darkness fell , he was on a rooftop pad with a young , handsome , and single intellectual property attorney , waiting to be picked up by the party 's hired dropflyer . The man 's name was Myricks , and he stood silently swaying , wearing a sleepy-eyed smile . <p> The dropflyer landed and they boarded , greeting the others and strapping themselves into the two remaining seats . The Financial District skyscrapers fell away from them as the dropflyer lifted off , pressing McDermott into his thickly cushioned seat ; the buildings blazed with lights , the brightest pocket of radiance in the city that revealed itself to them as they rose and then accelerated forward , arcing out toward the ocean . Below them , the city was a patterned network of lights broken by large areas of near darkness . Within the dark areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clustered candlelight and camp lanterns . <p> The dropflyer flew out over the ocean , bobbing up and down in the air like a carnival ride , then turned sharply and headed toward the natatorium . The pilot called in the access codes while the waves were still below them , then they were flying over wet sand , dry sand , then decelerating sharply into a shaky hover before finally descending and settling on one of the landing pads . At the door their IDs were checked , they walked through a series of scanners , and finally McDermott was inside . <p> It was n't much different from what he 'd imagined , but it was far larger . The rooms were vast , the ceilings thirty or forty feet above the floor , and each housed an enormous swimming pool as well as several rejuvenation ponds and numerous small spas for groups of five or six people at a time . Dozens of tables surrounded the pools , occupied by a mix of people in a bizarre array of swimsuits , evening wear , or the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suspended from the ceiling , emitted a bright and silvery iridescent light almost imperceptibly tinged with pink . Flocks of colorful macaws flew among the spheres or perched on artificial tree limbs , a flagrant violation of the law . <p> Attendants moved among the tables and pools and the mingling crowds , carrying trays of champagne in fluted glasses and cocktails of seemingly endless variety , or pushing carts loaded with smoked salmon and oysters , stuffed crab canapes , caramelized tropical fruits , enormous prawns with caviar cream , seared duck livers , and much more , all with elegant , calligraphic labels . <p> After the members of his party withdrew to dressing rooms to change into swimwear , McDermott wandered from one room to the next , still surprised at the number of people - the pools were full , few chairs were available at the tables , and he had to fight through dense crowds to move from one place to the next . <p> A string quartet performed in one room , a jazz ensemble in another , a slash-and-burn band in a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dozens of simultaneous conversations and the constant background splashing of bathers ; a miracle of acoustics kept the music and other noises isolated within the individual rooms . Private booths were available for rent in some of the rooms , and most of these , too , were occupied , their curtains drawn tightly shut . <p> In one room was a tiered balcony high above the floor , with tables and lounge chairs and booths overlooking the pools . McDermott climbed a spiral staircase and there he finally found a small unoccupied table and took a seat . Next to him , a group of men lounged on a sofa and discussed the dearth of premium items that would be available at an upcoming art auction . A woman in a sharkskin dress stopped by McDermott 's table and asked if she could join him . Unable to say no , he invited her to sit ; her dress slithered as she moved a chair closer to him . It was going to be an interminable night . <p> By dawn , McDermott was exhausted even though he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'oeuvres , and mindless conversations too numerous to count . His pager chirped , alerting him that the hired dropflyer was on its way in to pick them up . He moved among the pools and spas and ponds , all of them nearly empty as people left or prepared to leave , the warm waters now pallid and cloudy . <p> Outside , the air was fresh , heavy with the smell of salt as a warm morning breeze came in from the ocean . The Sun was just rising in the east , peeking above the surrounding ruins , reflecting from the natatorium windows in bright fiery colors . Three large armed buses filled with workers emerged from the ruins and bounced across the buffer zone , approaching the security station at the natatorium 's service bays . McDermott looked toward the river but there was no sign of Samuel . He walked out toward the landing pads and joined his haggard party to wait for their ride home . <p> When he went to the river that night he brought two cartons of cigarettes and a pound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the driftwood log and waited . He watched the murky river flowing past , and the air vehicles flying in and out of the natatorium , listened to the rustle of animals moving through the grass and kicking up sand ; he walked up and down the river , then followed it out to where it widened and flowed into the ocean , meeting the waves and creating thick ropes of foam in a constantly moving backwash . The Moon rose , but Samuel did n't appear . At midnight , McDermott left . <p> The next night , Samuel was on his stool with his line in the water when McDermott arrived . McDermott gave him the coffee and cigarettes , and Samuel smiled , saying , " I do n't smoke that much . Mind if I share them ? They 're scarce around here . " <p> " They 're yours , " McDermott answered . " You can do what you want with them . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> McDermott sat on the log , facing the natatorium rather than the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and the air traffic had been light ; only two or three ground vehicles sat in the lot . <p> " You have something on your mind , " Samuel said . " Something you want to ask me ? " <p> McDermott drank from his cup , then turned to Samuel . " Yes , but I do n't want you to misunderstand . The second time we met , you asked me what I wanted , and I said I wanted nothing . " <p> " I remember . " <p> " I meant it . I still mean it . " <p> " But now you want something from me . " <p> McDermott shook his head . " Not exactly . I 'm expecting delivery of some specialized maps sometime tomorrow night . The maps are old , and things have changed around here since then , and I do n't know this place at all . " He nodded at the water . " From what I understand , that river is n't even on the maps . " <p> " That river did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without taking his eyes from McDermott . " You want me to help you find something on your maps . " <p> " Yes , but I do n't want you to - " <p> Samuel cut him off with a wave of the cigarette . " It 's all right . What are you looking for ? " <p> McDermott shook his head , saying nothing . <p> Samuel smiled . " I see , trust only goes so far . Well , that 's understandable , we do n't really know each other . " He nodded . " I 'll help you find it , whatever it is . Something new and different . That does n't come along very often for me anymore . " <p> THEY WERE TO MEET two days later , at ten in the morning in the lobby of the deserted Sunset Beach Motel . McDermott drove a small , rusted and dented truck , the enclosed bed filled with a variety of tools . He saw a few people on the streets as he wound his way among potholes and old appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed one another with nothing more than nods . He parked in front of the motel and entered the sand-filled lobby , where Samuel waited for him . <p> They raised the blinds in the manager 's office , cleared off the desk , and McDermott laid out his maps - an old city street map , a topographic map , and a Water Department survey map . On the Water Department map , two tiny blue squares were circled in pencil . <p> " That 's what I need to find , " McDermott said , pointing at the circled squares . " Either one . Do n't have to find both . " <p> Samuel studied the map , then looked up and stared at McDermott . " I know who you are , " he said . <p> McDermott held his breath , wondering if it were true , and wondering what , if anything , Samuel would do if he did know . <p> " Who am I ? " he asked . <p> Samuel just shrugged as if McDermott 's identity were of little concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " Samuel said . " And a severe penalty for aiding you . " He turned his attention back to the maps and said , " Let 's see if we ca n't determine where these are . " <p> Everything appeared different in the daylight . The buildings , though dilapidated and run-down , did not have the appearance of ruins , but rather of a neighborhood that had fallen on hard times , sorely in need of basic repairs and maintenance but with the potential to be restored . Of course , McDermott thought to himself , the economics were never going to turn around for any of the people living here , and the place would continue to deteriorate . As they slowly drove through the streets , they met a few people on foot who called to Samuel by name , as he did to them . He had McDermott stop the truck while he talked for a few minutes with a young woman and her small child , asking how they were doing , and promising to stop by later in the day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , at the edge of the half mile of buffer zone , they parked the truck and Samuel asked to look at the maps again . He looked back and forth between the maps and their surroundings , then nodded once . They got out and Samuel attached a green flag to the broken side mirror . " This 'll keep it from getting stolen or stripped , " he said . <p> They walked around the corner of a two-story building that had once been a restaurant , and looked out at the natatorium . At this distance and in the bright light of midday , it appeared small and somehow lifeless , like a big greenhouse that had gone to seed . <p> Samuel led the way to a small cluster of tiny , shabby cabins at the end of a long , curving gravel drive . The cabins were ramshackle , with broken windows and doors , and rotten , sagging roofs ; what little paint remained on the siding was faded , cracked and peeling . Each cabin had a small porch and a weathered rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Samuel said . <p> He was right . They found the round metal lid at ground level between the third and fourth cabins , half-buried by sand and dirt , hidden by overgrown weeds . The lid was about two feet across and rusted shut . McDermott returned to the truck and brought back a crowbar , hammer and chisel , a can of rust solvent , and a flashlight . <p> In less than half an hour they had the lid pried open . McDermott , on hands and knees , could hear the bubbling of water and feel the damp warmth of the thermal springs . He aimed the flashlight beam down the concrete pipe and could just make out flashing reflections of water far below . He switched off the flashlight and lowered the lid . <p> They sat in a narrow strip of shade on the north side of the cabin . They drank coffee McDermott had brought , and Samuel smoked . <p> " What do you plan on dumping into the springs ? " Samuel asked . McDermott hesitated , then decided it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in . Or if he was , then it truly did n't make any difference what he told him . <p> " Two things , " he finally said . " First , several drums of a concentrated chemical that slowly reacts with human skin over a period of an hour or so , staining the skin of anyone in the water a deep bright red . It will take days , if not weeks , to get rid of the color . It 's completely colorless , so no one should notice it until it 's spread throughout the pools . After that , a couple of drums of an extremely noxious compound that should permanently foul the waters , the pipes , the pools , everything inside the natatorium with an unbearable stench . I know someone who was able to calculate water volumes and dispersion rates , so I 'm pretty sure the quantities I 've got will be sufficient . " He nodded once to himself . " That should put an end to their nights at the natatorium . " <p> " When will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the most crowded . " <p> They sat in silence for a time . McDermott poured more coffee for both of them , and Samuel smoked another cigarette . <p> " I 've been smoking more since I 've met you , " Samuel said . " You 've made cigarettes too readily available . " <p> " You have n't asked why I 'm doing this , " McDermott said . <p> " I know why you 're doing it , " Samuel replied . " I know why you sabotaged the cloud-sculpting festival in New Mexico , and created the snowmelt in Aspen during the Winter holidays , and sank that luxury casino riverboat in New Orleans , and all the other things you 've done over the years . " <p> " It 's not some personal revenge or anything like that , " McDermott said . <p> " Oh ; I did n't think it was . You 're trying to change things . You 're trying to wake up the wealthy and privileged . You 're trying to make them realize that there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the growing economic disparities , for their indifference to the ever-increasing numbers of the poor , for ... well , for being such miserable and uncaring human beings . " <p> McDermott had to smile in his surprise . " Something like that , yeah . You 've thought a lot about it . " <p> " Thinking about things like that was what I did for a living . For a while , anyway . " <p> " Really ? What did you do ? " <p> " I was an economist . I worked as an economics analyst for the State Department . For Saharan Africa . " <p> " I 'm impressed . " <p> Samuel shook his head . " I was completely ineffective at changing policy or helping anyone in those countries . I was just as ineffective at changing the way anything was done in the State Department . I finally gave up . Resigned . " <p> " And after that ? " <p> " I taught economics at MIT until they decided not to renew my contract because my politics were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple life , I sit by the river at night , and I have more time to think than I 've ever had . " <p> " And what do you think about what I 've been doing ? " McDermott asked . <p> This time it was Samuel 's turn not to answer . " Are we done here ? " he asked . " I promised Consuela I would stop by her place . " <p> McDermott got to his feet and glanced once more at the natatorium . " Yes , we 're done here . For now . " <p> Saturday night he drove his truck through the streets with the windows open and the lights off , creeping along by the light of the stars and the distant glow of the natatorium . As he headed up the winding drive to the cabins , he could hear the loud crunch of gravel beneath the tires . He backed the truck into position , got out , and was not surprised to see Samuel step out of the shadows . McDermott remained motionless , waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised him greatly , but Samuel was alone . The old man approached and they shook hands . <p> " So it is tonight , " Samuel said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " You should poison them , you know , " Samuel said calmly . <p> " What ? " The words took him by surprise , so that he felt unsure of what he 'd heard . <p> " You should poison them , " Samuel repeated . " Take away those barrels you have in the truck , find sufficient quantities of poison , and then return here some other Saturday . Do it properly . " <p> " Kill them ? " <p> " Yes . Kill them . " <p> McDermott shook his head , feeling a growing sense of discomfort . " Then I would be no better than they are . " <p> Samuel shrugged . " That 's irrelevant . You want to change the status quo . What you plan to do tonight will be nothing more than an irritation to them . Like some annoying pest . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change anything , you must do much more . Hurt them badly or they 'll go on as before . They will just find another place to amuse themselves , and nothing will change . " When McDermott did n't reply , Samuel went on . <p> " Nothing you 've ever done has changed anything . Even more violent and destructive events brought about by others have had no effect on these people . Look at the water riots in Southern California last year , or the flooding of the subways in Boston after the transit workers strike . And all of the other localized disturbances , the lootings and arson outbreaks , more and more every year . Those with money wo n't change a thing until they 're directly and severely affected . " <p> " You would kill them ? " McDermott said . <p> " I ? " Samuel smiled and shook his head . " Oh , no , not at all . I 'm not trying to change anything . You are . " He sighed . " Now I try to accept things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can . Change is far too difficult and costly . " <p> " The way things are now is too difficult and costly , " McDermott said fiercely . <p> " I would not argue that with you , " Samuel replied . " Both things are true . " <p> McDermott looked out at the natatorium , which gleamed like some fantastic and immense living jewel out on the sands . Both things are true . He felt a nascent fear rising in his chest and gut , fear of the reality of Samuel 's words , fear of the implications . Fear of blood . <p> " There must , be some middle ground , some way to effect change without resorting to killing and destruction . " <p> " I think not , " Samuel said sadly . " Not anymore . If there was such a time when that was possible , it has been gone for years . For decades . " <p> McDermott shook his head , fighting the fear , struggling to crush it and eliminate it . He felt as though Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to suppress , and now he was trying to suppress it once again . " I 'm not ready to accept that , " he said . " Not yet . " <p> " I understand . Someday , however , you will realize you have no choice . I suspect that day is coming soon . Then ... well , I wonder what path you will choose . " <p> Distressed but determined , McDermott went to the back of the truck and unlocked the shell cover and tailgate , revealing the large barrels , carefully packed to prevent them from rolling or crashing into each other . <p> " Let me help you with those , " Samuel offered . <p> " Why ? I thought you did n't see any point to it . " <p> " That does n't matter . I am here , and I am helping a friend with a difficult task . That is worth doing . " <p> McDermott rigged up the makeshift ramp he 'd prepared , then together they rolled the three large metal barrels down the ramp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They carried the other two smaller drums between them , and set them back against the cabin wall . McDermott retrieved two respirators and two pair of neoprene gloves from the truck seat and handed one of each to Samuel . <p> " I brought extras in case you were here . " <p> They fitted the respirators over their faces , pulled on the gloves , then McDermott raised the round metal lid , exposing the concrete-lined hole . With Samuel 's help , he positioned the first barrel over the edge of the hole , propping up the bottom end on a concrete block so the barrel was tilted toward the hole , then unscrewed the wide cap . <p> The liquid emerged fitfully from the barrel until McDermott popped open the vent at the other end of the lid , then it flowed smoothly and quickly , a steady stream pouring down the hole and into the thermal springs . It took several minutes for the barrel to empty . McDermott and Samuel repeated the process with the other two barrels . They waited twenty , twenty-five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took care of the two smaller drums himself . The compound was thick but nearly clear , so that it seemed he was pouring pure water into the springs . <p> When both drums were empty , McDermott dropped the lid back over the hole , and the two of them moved back toward the truck , removing the respirators . <p> " Now what ? " Samuel asked . " What about the barrels ? " <p> " I 'm going to leave them . I do n't care if they find them . I want them to know it was deliberate . But we need to get away from here . I 'm not sure how long it will take for this stuff to reach the natatorium , but it wo n't be that long . " <p> They climbed into the truck and pulled away from the cabins . McDermott still drove without the headlights , but he drove more quickly now , and they bounced and banged over potholes and unidentifiable chunks of rubble . <p> " Where do you want me to take you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can hide the truck , " Samuel answered . " Then you can come to my place and watch the results of your work , if you like . " <p> McDermott glanced at Samuel , thought about it for a moment , then nodded . <p> Samuel directed him down one street , then another , then eventually pointed the way to an underground parking garage beneath what had once been a supermarket . They parked the truck in the back corner , behind two concrete pillars , then walked back up the ramp and onto the street . <p> Samuel grabbed McDermott 's arm and pulled him back into the shadows up against the supermarket wall . Moments later McDermott heard the thumping of a police dragoncopter , and almost immediately afterward they saw the flashing blue and white lights of the copter pass overhead , waves of heat distortion in its wake . <p> " It 's started , " Samuel said quietly . " We 'll have to be careful . " <p> They moved cautiously from building to building and street to street , sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sound of dragoncopters , holing up whenever one passed . Four more flew overhead as they made their way to Samuel 's townhouse , and once they had to press themselves into a thicket of dense shrubs as an armored police cruiser rolled past with headlights blazing and rooftop searchlight beam sweeping the street . <p> They climbed the stairs to the second floor of the townhouse . In the darkness , McDermott could n't see much , but he noticed there was no carpeting and guessed that it had all been torn out years ago . Samuel led the way to the front room with its large picture windows and sliding glass doors that opened onto a large balcony . The picture windows were cracked but still intact ; the air coming in through the open doors was warm and humid , but refreshing as it broke up the still air inside the rooms . <p> Samuel had been right about the view . They were high enough to see over the top of the low , grass-topped dunes , with an unobstructed view of the natatorium aglow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chaos , with dragoncopters circling the area , vying for airspace with dozens of private aircraft arriving and trying to land to pick up panicked clients who had called them back early . A few of the copters were on the ground , along with ground cruisers , ambulances , and haz-mat vans , while hundreds of people scrambled around outside the natatorium , swarming over the pads and making landing even more difficult . From this distance , the noise was a roaring confusion of shouts and high-pitched cries , thumping from the copters and whining from the pods and flyers , garbled orders barked out over speakers , and shattering glass and banging metal . He thought many of the people were still in swimsuits , but at this distance and with the crazed mix of lights and shadow and frantic motion everywhere , it was difficult to tell anything for sure . <p> McDermott felt surprisingly empty and uneasy . Samuel was right , there was something absurd and ridiculous about what was happening out there right now . It had the surface appearance of some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be forgotten except for the occasional ribbing of those who still bore traces of red stain on their skin , jokes told about the panic and the stench , and fond reminiscences of tropical nights at the natatorium . The natatorium would be closed down , but there would be some new place for the privileged to amuse themselves at night , some new source of indulgent pleasures , some new mode of excess . <p> He stepped out onto the balcony and leaned against the rail , unafraid of being seen - no one was searching this area , no one was doing anything right now except out at the natatorium itself , and it would be hours before things were under control there . Samuel joined him , bringing out two folding chairs . " No sense being uncomfortable , " he said . <p> They set up the chairs and sat in them and watched the events playing out at the natatorium . Samuel put a cigarette in his mouth but did n't light it . <p> " There 's some good in seeing all of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Samuel said . " Too bad it wo n't last . " <p> McDermott breathed in long and deep , held it for a few moments , then slowly let it out . " It 's not enough , is it ? " he said . <p> " No , it 's not enough . " Samuel took the cigarette from his mouth and looked at it , then turned to McDermott . " How old are you ? " <p> " Forty-seven . " <p> " Then you 've been alive long enough to see many changes , but I 've seen even more , and almost none of them have been for the better . " He turned back toward the ocean . " This is the kind of weather we had in the Sudan when I was growing up , hot and humid like this , but it was never like this here when my family first came to this city , not even in the hottest of summers . Now , this is considered mild . Remember last summer ? " <p> McDermott nodded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel gestured at the natatorium with his cigarette . " Those people do n't understand what that means . Or if they do understand , they do n't care . They think that as long as they have plenty of money , none of it affects them . What they do n't understand is how wrong they are , and they wo n't understand that until it 's too late . " He sighed . " I think it 's already too late . " <p> McDermott felt the fear growing in his gut once more , stronger now . " You 're a disturbingly wise man , Samuel . " <p> " No . I 've seen a lot in my life , that 's all . As I said to you before , I 've had a lot of time to think about things . " He put the cigarette back between his lips and shook his head . " It does no one any good . " <p> They remained on the balcony watching the spastic dance of air vehicles and the kaleidoscope of lights , the sliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sand , and the river flowing through the night and into the dark , vast ocean like blood from riots and clashes and other struggles to come . Neither of them spoke again , for there was nothing more to be said . <p> MCDERMOTT RETURNED a week later and found Samuel by the river , this time without his fishing pole . He sat on his stool , but facing away from the river , looking out toward the natatorium , which was now little more than a hulking lifeless shadow against the beach and the ocean , the steelglass only dimly reflecting bits of light . <p> " I 'm sick of fish , " Samuel explained with a smile . <p> McDermott sat on the driftwood log and handed a key to Samuel . " This is for the truck . It 's under the supermarket , where we parked it that night . I 'm leaving , and I wo n't need it . " <p> Samuel pocketed the key . " Thanks . It might come in handy . " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it soon , there are a few things in the back end you might be able to use . " In fact , the back of the truck was filled with canned food , bags of rice , cigarettes , coffee , and first aid supplies , as much as McDermott could pack into it . <p> " Where are you going now ? " Samuel asked . <p> " I do n't know . I 'll decide when I get to the train station . I like riding trains , and I 'm not sure how much longer they 'll be around . " <p> " And when you arrive wherever you 're going , what will you do then ? " <p> " I do n't know that , either . I 'm afraid now , Samuel . I was n't afraid before , but I am now . " He stood . " Thanks for everything . " <p> Samuel shook his head . " I do n't think I did you any good . " <p> " You were a friend . That was worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel . Take care of yourself . " <p> " You too . " <p> McDermott took one last look at the abandoned natatorium , then turned and headed toward the city , toward a future that daily grew more frightening and uncertain . <p> Author Affiliation
