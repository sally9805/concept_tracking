More than 30 million Americans wo n't get enough to eat this month . What 's being done about it ? // Children with distended bellies and protruding ribs , desolate and dusty landscapes ravaged by massive crop failures and civil war : These are our images of hunger , and we associate them with far-off nations like Somalia , Ethiopia and Afghanistan . But here , in the richest nation in the world , we do n't have food shortages or diseases with exotic names like kwashiokor or maramus . The world 's largest exporter of wheat and corn , the United States produces more than enough food for its citizens . What 's more , we import foods from all over the world and enjoy one of the most varied cuisines on earth . Produce that was rare at the turn of the century , like bananas and oranges , is now found at every corner store . Compared with the rest of the world , food is dirt-cheap here . American consumers spend a smaller percentage of their income on food-7.7 percent in 1993-than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau estimates that 31 million Americans are " food insecure , " meaning they do n't know if they 'll be able to buy enough groceries to last the month . Unlike the image of famine in the developing world , the picture of hunger in America is a subtle one . It 's more likely to be a child who puts her head down on her school desk because she 's too hungry to concentrate , or an elderly person who skimps on meals to pay for medicine , or even a parent who skips dinner to feed a child . In the United States , hunger tends to creep into a family 's life gradually , running on a parallel track to increasing money problems . First a struggling family cuts back on extras . Then they frequently reduce the quality of the food they buy , filling up on inexpensive and often unhealthful foods . Sometimes it comes down to choosing between paying the rent or putting food on the table . While few Americans experience malnutrition severe enough to cause fatal diseases , millions are undernourished-lacking adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like to worry about feeding a family . The 32-year-old Springfield , Va. , mother of two has a long relationship with so-called food insecurity . Growing up in Little Rock , Ark. , Chapman and her family relied on food stamps to round out their diet . " My mother even gave us our allowance in food stamps , " she recalls . But she did n't experience the real anxiety of not being able to get enough to eat until she was 16-when her mother kicked her out of the house . Leaving her 2-year-old daughter in her mother 's care , the teen was on the streets for six months . " I basically had to put my morals on the line because I did n't know how else I was going to eat , " she says . She begged from students at the university cafeteria , got handouts from a 7-Eleven and stole from grocery stores . Eventually Chapman got back on track : She sorted out her problems with her mother , graduated from high school and got a job . Today , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization in Washington , D.C. , Chapman is squarely within the middle class . " But people are always surprised when they find out I was once homeless and hungry , " she says . Ask people if they think hunger is a major American problem and you 're likely to get a blank stare . " People just do n't know the facts because hunger is hidden in this country . Your next-door neighbor could be hungry and you would n't know it , " says Lynette Englehardt Stott , domestic policy analyst at Bread for the World , a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington , D.C. Increasingly , studies are showing that hunger is n't just a problem that affects the homeless or unemployed . " The face of hunger in America has changed , " says Stott . " Now we 're seeing more and more people lining up at the soup kitchens who are working . " The U.S. Conference of Mayors last year found that more than two-thirds of adults who requested emergency food assistance from soup kitchens or pantries were gainfully employed . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three minimum-wage jobs-just does n't cut it anymore . A person working full-time at the minimum wage ( $10,700 per year ) is lucky if he can support himself providing the main support for a family is out of the question . At these wages , a person falls more than $6,000 below the official federal poverty level for a family of four . Even those working families who receive federal assistance in the form of food stamps may not have enough to cover the month 's food bill . A 1997 survey by Chicagobased America 's Second Harvest , the largest hunger relief organization in the country , found that 82 percent of their clients run out of food stamps before the end of the month , putting these individuals , along with scores of the homeless , back on the soup kitchen line . FEEDING THE FUTURE A missed meal here and there does n't seem like a big deal , but the results of sustained hunger can be life-altering , particularly for the estimated 12 million children who regularly do n't get enough to eat . Studies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's development . From the moment of conception onward , adequate nutrition is essential for healthy growth . Undernourished pregnant women are more , likely to have low birth-weight babies , who are then more likely to suffer developmental problems . " Babies and children who do n't get enough to eat do n't develop the way human beings are supposed to , " explains Lynn Parker , M.S. , director of child nutrition programs at the Food Research Action Center ( FRAC ) , a nonprofit organization in Washington , D.C. Even before hunger becomes severe , inadequate food intake inhibits the ability of children to learn about the world around them . The limited calories they take in go first to maintaining organ function , then to growth and last to social activity and learning . Listless and irritable , hungry children find it difficult to concentrate in school and have a hard time socializing normally . These kids are also more susceptible to illness and more likely to miss school . Statistically , they suffer from higher rates of depression , score lower on standardized tests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they experience hunger for a prolonged period , they 'll grow into adults with less potential to become productive members of society . Photograph // The effects of hunger on adults are not as well documented . Physiologically , hunger is known to cause fatigue and lowered resistance to illness . But the psychological strain of being unable to provide for oneself or one 's children in a nation of " haves " can be extremely damaging . This sense of shame is one of , the top reasons that many needy folks never even apply for federal assistance . A U.S. Department of Agriculture study last year found that 12 million people-including 1 million childrenwho were eligible for food stamps were n't receiving them . GOVERNMENT GOOD DEEDS The federal government has put much effort into creating programs to help those who are going hungry . Besides the Food Stamp Program , it has set up other special plans . These include the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) , which provides milk and other foods to pregnant mothers and young children ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million children free or reduced-price lunches daily ; and the smaller School Breakfast and Summer Feeding Program for kids . Although these means of assistance do n't reach every hungry person , they are generally regarded by activists as the best tools we have . The Food Stamp Program , which was established in 1964 , has helped millions stave off hunger , but it has also come under fire for being easy to abuse . In response to criticism from Congress , many states ( which administer the program on the local level ) have gradually transformed the application process into a Kafkaesque nightmare . A study by America 's Second Harvest revealed that the average food stamp application form is 12 pages long and written on a 9th- to 12th-grade level-even though the average applicant only reads at a 5th-grade level . Most states force applicants to tally up every possible source of income ; Hawaii even counts revenues from yard sales . Until last year , food stamp recipients were barred from owning a car worth more than $4,600 . Ellen Vollinger , domestic policy analyst at FRAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaic , stingy asset test that 's keeping people from being helped , " she says . Heidi Chapman is a perfect case in point . At 18 , she was told she did n't qualify because she owned a $6,000 car . Having just landed a job as a courier with the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign , she was n't about to sell her car . " If I 'd sold my car , I would n't have been able to work . It was an impossible situation . " In a majority of states , the process requires applicants , who are often working full-time , to make repeated trips to the welfare office to get into and remain in the program . Mathematics Policy Research , Inc. , a nonpartisan firm , found it takes an average of five hours and at least two trips to the food stamp office to enroll . " Working people just say , The heck with it , " ' says Vollinger . " It comes down to a simple cost-benefit analysis . By the time you go down to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost time and wages . " Even for those people who do make the effort , the rewards are n't great . Food stamp benefits across the United States average $71 per person each month . That 's because the government bases benefits on something they call the " Thrifty Meal Plan , " a formula that allows just 80 cents per person per meal . And the number of people receiving even this assistance is quickly dropping . As part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 , better known as " welfare reform , " the federal government took money out of the Food Stamp Program and made it more difficult to qualify for welfare . People who were no longer eligible for welfare assumed that they did n't qualify for food stamps either , which was n't the case . As a result , since 1996 , a staggering 9 million people have disappeared from the Food Stamp rolls , bringing the total down to two-thirds its former number , just 17 million . " We 'd be happy if we could explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last five years , " says Vollinger . " But that 's not the case . " The problem was compounded by the fact that in many states , overburdened social workers never told people that they still qualified for food stamps . Very often , the welfare and food stamp databases were linked and when a welfare case closed , food stamp records were also automatically expunged , says Susan Hofer , of America 's Second Harvest . The welfare reform bill also eliminated food stamp benefits for legal immigrants . After two years of lobbying from hunger activist groups , Congress passed another law that restored benefits to some of these immigrants , including children and the elderly . But it still left an estimated 500,000 people out in the cold . " Immigrants pay social security and taxes just like American citizens . So why should n't we provide them with the same social services ? " asks Anuradha Mittal , codirector of the Institute for Food and Development Policy , the Oakland , Calif-based hunger advocacy group founded by Diet for a Small Planet author Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private charities have witnessed a dramatic surge in the demand for emergency food assistance . America 's Second Harvest , which has more than 50,000 affiliated food banks and pantries around the country , distributed at least 1.3 billion pounds nationwide at its facilities last year , an increase of nearly 25 percent over 1999 . But that still was n't enough to make up the shortfall created by the cuts to food stamps , according to Eleanor Thompson , public policy analyst at the group 's headquarters . To serve the increasing number of people seeking help , food pantries affiliated with America 's Second Harvest have been forced to cut back on how much food is given to hungry people . Additionally , they frequently have to limit the number of times a family can show up at a center for help . " I think we 're doing a good job at providing emergency food , but we certainly ca n't do it all , " says Thompson . Stott echoes her sentiments . " Churches and charities will never , ever be able to fill the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just far too great . " THE KINDNESS OF OTHERS Private food pantries and soup kitchens are not the answer to feeding the nadon 's hungry . They ca n't handle the sheer number of people seeking assistance , nor do they provide the best nutrition . Furthermore , because people who are forced to rely on charitable assistance ca n't choose what they eat , individual preferences or personal dietary restrictions do n't come into play-you have to eat what 's on the menu if you want to eat at all . For people with problems like heart disease or diabetes who need to watch their diets , this can present a real problem . Chapman , diagnosed with pancreatitis , a disease that inhibits the pancreas from releasing the enzymes necessary to digest food , had to be very careful about what she ate . About a year ago , she switched to a vegetarian diet after discovering it was easier on her digestion . " And it 's not like soup kitchens have a lot of vegetarian options , " she says . It so happens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fresh vegetables . Because of the difficulties in obtaining and storing donations of fresh produce , many food banks and pantries rely largely on canned goods and processed foods . Moreover , the majority of emergency food banks are run by Volunteers . " These are people with good hearts but often no training whatsoever in nutrition , " says Stott . Getting the most nutritional bang for their buck is especially important to strapped families . But options are limited . Supermarket chains have been moving out of the cities and relocating to the suburbs in droves . As a result , poor urban families often have to rely on expensive mom-and-pop stores , which typically do n't have good selections of fresh fruits and vegetables . Yet fast-food options , especially in poorer neighborhoods , abound . " In these lowincome areas , the cheapest foods tend to be snack and fast foods that do n't provide much nutrition , " says Dorie Seaver , director of the Food Security Institute at Brandeis University . " Ironically , you see people who are both obese and food-insecure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery stores , there 's no guarantee they 'd know how to shop for and prepare nutritious meals . Of course , that does n't make them much different from a large segment of the American populace . Since the majority of our public schools-or even medical schools-do n't make nutrition a required subject , most of us could benefit from a class or two on how to prepare healthy meals . Unfortunately , even as the federal government has created the means to get people more food , it has n't placed a very high priority on funding nutrition programs . One that is filling this gap is Operation Frontline , run by the Washington , D.C.-based , nonprofit Share Our Strength ( SOS ) . Currently in 13 states , SOS employs volunteer chefs to teach people how to buy and prepare nutritious food on a tight budget . SOLUTIONS THAT WORK One thing advocacy groups agree on is that hunger is a problem that can be solved . " It 's not some disease nobody knows the cure for , " says Vollinger . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bread for the World has even put a price tag on it : $5 billion a year . Funneling that money into the Food Stamp Program would n't solve the problem entirely , but according to Bread for the World 's estimations , it would cut the number of hungry people in this country almost in half , to 16 million people . And in a nation that is ( at press time ) considering a $1.6 trillion tax cut , that number is a mere drop in the bucket . " We are literally talking about pennies per person per day , " says Stott . As critical as people like Stott , Vollinger and Mittal are of the Food Stamp Program , they concur that for now , it 's the best thing going . Without it , there would be many millions more suffering from hunger . The infrastructure of the program is there ; it just needs to be tinkered with . Some suggestions are as simple as extending office hours so working parents do n't have to take time off to apply ; simplifying the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting rid of insulting and complex questions about family assets that deter people from completing the applications . A few baby steps have been taken to make the program easier . Thirty-nine states now issue electronic benefit cards that look like ATM cards , removing some of the embarrassment associated with traditional food stamps . Beyond that , groups including Bread for the World and America 's Second Harvest are calling for more money to be devoted to outreach plans to encourage ( or inform in the first place ) the many thousands of people who do n't even know they are eligible to apply . THE BARE MINIMUM Originally , federal assistance programs were created as a stopgap measure . Even then , the government recognized that hunger is n't a self-contained problem . Rather , it 's a reflection of the deeper problem of poverty in this nation-a problem that continues to grow even in economic boom times . One of the most disturbing economic trends is the increasing inability of some workers to maintain a decent standard of living . At $5.15 an hour , the minimum-wage job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget about a nutritious diet . Minimum wage has n't even kept pace with inflation , much less the real cost of living . The last time it was adjusted was five years ago , yet many politicians argue against raising it during the current economic slowdown , claiming that it would increase unemployment even more because employers would lay off workers to meet the increased payroll costs . But according to the Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) , a Washington , D.C.-based think tank , the last time the minimum wage was raised during an economic downturn ( 1990-91 ) , there were no associated job losses . EPI estimates that if the minimum wage were upped by just a buck and a half today , it would increase the salaries of 11.9 million people-nearly 10 percent of the workforce . A proposal currently before Congress would step the minimum wage up by this amount , but only in increments over a period of three years ( 60 cents in 2001 , another 50 cents in 2002 and 40 cents in 2003 ) . But if wages keep pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implemented in 2003 , just 5.8 percent of the workforce-or about 7 million workers-would receive a pay increase , according to EPI 's figures . To make matters worse , the Bush Administration has suggested that states be able to choose whether or not they participate in the increase . So out of fear that large employers would take their business elsewhere , the states with the highest number of low-wage workers would be the most likely to decide not to raise the wage . MAKING A DIFFERENCE The ultimate goal of the hunger relief movement , of course , is to help families become self-sufficient and not dependent on public assistance or private charities at all . " Honestly , as important as churches and charities are , they simply do n't cut it , " says Stott . " Families should be eating together at home . They should be able to obtain food in a respectful and dignified way . " When Heidi Chapman was denied food stamps , she told her boss at the Clinton campaign . Sympathetic to her plight , he immediately gave her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending , however . There are still 10 million families in this country who are n't sure if they 'll be able to put dinner on the table tonight . But there are plenty of ways for us " haves " to make a difference . Volunteering at a soup kitchen or pantry is one way to help . Another important step is. to join an advocacy group that represents your views and helps you stay informed about what 's going on in Congress . But as important as those steps are , we can also vote for politicians who put ending hunger on their agenda . " At the end of the day , what politicians really care about is getting elected , " says Mittal . " People have had this attitude that their vote does n't count , but I think in the last year we 've seen that is n't true , " says Mittal . Indeed , the power to end hunger lies with us .
