1 <p> The girl kept half-turning in the back seat to stare out the rear window of the cab , as though she were being chased across Buffalo to the hospital . It made Pete Sawicki as nervous as she was . He kept flicking his eyes to the rearview mirror , but all the way to the hospital he saw trucks , people driving station wagons to the supermarket , kids throwing baseballs beside empty streets  --  nothing at all that was suspicious except her . He pulled up to the emergency room entrance and got out of his cab to open her door . <p> She had a pretty face . She was very young , maybe even jailbait , with long light brown hair , eyes that looked gray-green , full lips that seemed to pout as she concentrated on getting out of the back seat of the cab . Pete held his hand out to help her , but she deflected his attention with a look that went past him as though he were gone already . Usually somebody who wanted a cab ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood and once again her belly showed , stood out from her body under the loose shirt . It was none of his business , but Pete could n't help seeing the pregnancy as tragic in somebody her age . How could it not be ? <p> " How much ? " she said , her hand already moving into her purse . <p> " Eight bucks . " <p> She frowned . " It ca n't be . " <p> He pretended to look inside at the meter , and chuckled to himself . " You 're right . It 's twelve . " He took the fifteen dollars she handed him . " Thanks . And thanks for noticing that . " He stepped around the cab to his door , watched her walking to the emergency room , and waited until he saw the glass doors slide open to admit her and then close . He got back into the cab , reached into his pocket , took out a ten-dollar bill to pay for the rest of her fare , and put it into the cashbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed he would head out to the airport and take a place in the line there . It was still early in the day and flights from the west would start coming in soon . <p> AT THE RECEPTION DESK the woman in the uniform told the girl to sit and wait , but the triage nurse came out only a couple of minutes later and brought her into an office . The nurse said , " If you 've got to be in the emergency room , you picked a good time . Beginning in the late afternoon , things get pretty hectic . " The girl recited the symptoms as well as she could remember them , and then she had to answer the nurse 's questions . Some were the obvious ones anyone would ask a pregnant woman , and some seemed to be all-purpose questions for emergency rooms . If you answered yes to any of them , you would belong in a hospital . <p> When the nurse started to stand , the girl said abruptly , " Do you happen to know a woman named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may have heard the name . Why ? " <p> " Oh , it 's not important . Somebody I know told me if I was in this hospital I should say hello for her . " <p> " It 's a big hospital . I 'm going to have you wait in an examining room . A doctor will be in to see you shortly . " <p> The girl sat on the narrow bed in the small white room to wait for the doctor . She felt stupid , humiliated . Why would anybody ask her to say hello to somebody in an emergency room ? Her mistake made her more nervous . She looked at the complicated telephone mounted on the wall . It made no sound , but she could see colored lights along the top , some steady and others blinking  --  green , red , and yellow . She stood and looked at it more closely . Maybe she could find the right button to make an announcement over the hospital 's public-address system . She had a professional-sounding telephone voice . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jane Whitefield , please report to the emergency room . Jane Whitefield , there is a patient to see you in the emergency room . " It would be a huge risk , because they might throw her out or even have her arrested , but she had to do something . <p> The girl stepped closer and looked for labels on the buttons , then heard a woman 's voice talking , growing louder as the woman came up the hall . The girl turned away from the phone and heard the swish of fabric as the woman stepped into the room . The woman was brown-skinned , about forty years old , and seemed to be from the Middle East or Asia . She wore a starched white coat with a gold name tag . " Christine ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I 'm Dr. Depredha . Are you in pain ? Are you having cramps now ? " <p> " Once in a while they come back . " <p> " Bleeding ? " <p> " I think it stopped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stethoscope and pressed it against Christine 's neck for a few seconds . " All right . Let 's get you undressed and I 'll give you a brief exam , so we 'll know more . " She opened a drawer , took out a package , and tore it open . Christine could see it was a gown . " You can put this on , and I 'll be back in a minute . " She started out , pulling the door after her . <p> " Doctor ? " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Do you know a woman named Jane Whitefield ? " <p> " Sounds familiar . Is she a doctor ? " <p> " I do n't know . Someone I know said I might run into her here . " <p> One of Dr. Depredha 's perfect curved eyebrows gave an eloquent upward twitch that conveyed sympathy , apology , and yet , a businesslike urgency . " I have n't been here long . I 'll be back . " She went out and closed the door . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more panicky . Sweat dampened her shirt and nausea was coming on . She had come so far , and she was so frightened . Now that she was here , the place seemed to be a lot of blank , unknowing faces and closed doors , and she had no idea how long she would be safe here . She fought the impulse to step out the door and run , and began to undress . This was the plan she had chosen . She had to carry it through and give it a chance to work . If she could n't find Jane Whitefield , at least maybe she could stay here long enough to rest . <p> DR . DEPREDHA HURRIED OUT to the reception area and spotted the big security officer near the doors to the parking lot . As she stepped toward him she saw his head turn , his dark , intelligent eyes see her , and his black face smile down at her . " Mr. Mathews . " <p> " Dr. Depredha . What can I do for you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he always brought with him . He was about six feet seven and weighed , by her estimate , two hundred and eighty pounds , but his manner made him seem like a doting uncle . <p> She had to speak quickly and just above a whisper . " I just got a patient , a pregnant female who listed her age as twenty . She 's showing signs of extreme anxiety . She 's afraid . Genuinely frightened . " <p> " Do you need help with her ? " <p> " Not with her . She 's perfectly docile . But I have a feeling about this . She acts as though she were being chased . Do you understand ? " <p> He nodded . " What does she look like ? " <p> " Caucasian , brown hair , light eyes . Looks younger than twenty . Her name is Christine . The triage nurse noted that she arrived alone in a taxi . " <p> " I saw her . All right , Doctor , " said Mr. Mathews . " I 'll begin watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Thank you , Mr. Mathews . " She turned and hurried back through the automatic doors that led to the examining rooms . <p> Officer Stanley Mathews stepped to the outer doors of the emergency room and looked out . He was n't quite sure what he was looking for  --  an angry parent or brother , an abusive boyfriend , or even some female rival with a gun in her purse . Dr. Depredha was n't some flighty , overprotected woman who imagined danger . Before she had come to this country she had been in a couple of wars , doing battlefield patch-up jobs while incoming mortar rounds thumped inside the perimeter near enough to bounce the instruments on the table . He 'd seen a bit of that sort of thing himself . If she felt uneasy , he felt uneasy . He pushed open the double doors with both hands and stepped outside to see who might have pulled into the parking lot since he 'd last looked . Some people had seen enough terror and misery in their lives so they seemed to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it . <p> JANE MCKINNON SURVEYED the room from the doorway . Tonight the hospital cafeteria had been not only decorated but disguised , the windows covered with long drapes and the ceiling hung with clusters of hundreds of white Japanese lanterns of different sizes . The benefit seemed to be going smoothly . People were moving away from the hors d'oeuvre tables and circulating instead of knotting up near the food and drink . The conversation was loud and continuous . The band had arrived , set up , and done sound checks during the late afternoon , so that when the music started it would be tolerable . As Jane moved in among the guests , her tall , erect shape and the light blue evening dress that set off the dark skin and black hair she had inherited from her father made people turn to watch her for a moment . The intense blue eyes she 'd inherited from her mother acknowledged them and moved on . <p> " Jane ! " <p> A man 's voice , too close , coming from above her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hands-face-body in the first fraction of a second . It was only Gary Wanamaker , the hospital 's director of development . The muscles in her arms and back relaxed , and she managed a smile . Her knees straightened from the preparatory flex that the long evening dress had hidden from view . For some reason she had n't recognized the voice . She was jumpy tonight , abnormally alert . <p> Copyright 2009 by Thomas Perry <p> All rights reserved .
