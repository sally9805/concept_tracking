It was supposed to be a vacation . It was supposed to be fun , relaxing , enlightening . It was not supposed to be terrifying . No , no , terrifying was an exaggeration . Slightly . A wicked summer storm , a strange road snaking through a dark forest where the trees were like giants cloaked in the armor of mists . Kayleen Brennan of the Boston Brennans was n't terrified by such things . She was made of sterner stuff . She made a point of reminding herself of that , every ten seconds or so as she fought to keep the rental car on the muddy ditch that had started out as a road . She was a practical woman , had made the decision to be one quite deliberately and quite clearly when she was twelve . No flights of fancy for Kayleen , no romantic dreams or foolish choices . She had watchedwas still watchingsuch occupations lead her charming , adorable , and baffled mother into trouble . Financial trouble . Legal trouble . Man trouble . So Kayleen had become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult was not spooked by a bunch of trees and a few streaks of lightning , or by mists that thickened and thinned as if they breathed . A grown woman did n't panic because she 'd made a wrong turn . When the road was too narrow , as this one was , to allow her to safely turn around , she simply kept going until she found her way again . And a sensible person did not start imagining she heard things in the storm . Like voices . Shouldhave stayed in Dublin , she told herself grimly as she bumped over a rut . In Dublin with its busy streets and crowded pubs , Ireland had seemed so civilized , so modern , so urbane . But no , she 'd just had to see some of the countryside , had n't she ? Just had to rent a car , buy a map , and head out to explore . But honestly , it had been a perfectly reasonable thing to do . She 'd intended to see the country while she was here and perhaps find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston . She 'd intended to wander the roads , to drive to the sea , to visit the pretty little villages , and the great , grand ruins . Had n't she booked her stay in a licensed bed-and-breakfast for each night that she 'd be traveling ? Confirmed reservations ensured there would be no inconvenience and no surprises at the end of each day 's journey . Had n't she precisely mapped out her route and each point of interest , how long she intended to stay studying each ? She had n't anticipated getting lost . No one did . The weather report had indicated some rain , but this was Ireland , after all . It had not indicated a wild , windy , wicked thunderstorm that shook her little car like a pair of dice in a cup and turned the long , lovely summer twilight into raging dark . Still , it was all right . It was perfectly all right . She was just a bit behind schedule , and it was partly her own fault . She 'd lingered a bit longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a bit longer again at the churchyard she 'd come across when she headed west . She was certainly still in County Wicklow , certainly somewhere in Avondale Forest , and the guidebook had stated that the population through the forested land was thin , the villages few and far between . She had expected to find it charming and atmospheric , a delightful drive on her way to her night 's stay in Enniscorthy , a destination she 'd been scheduled to reach by seven-thirty . She tipped up her arm , risked a quick glance at her watch , and winced when she saw she was already a full hour late . Does n't matter . Surely they would n't lock the doors on her . The Irish were known for their hospitality . She intended to put that to the test as soon as she came across a town , a village , or even a single cottage . Once she did , she 'd get her bearings again . But for now ... She stopped dead in the road , realizing she had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as ruthlessly organized as her life , sat on the seat beside her . She took out the cell phone , she 'd rented , turned it on . And swore softly when the readout told her , as it had since she 'd driven into the forest far enough to realize she was lost , that she had no signal . " Why do n't I have a signal ? " She nearly rapped the phone against the steering wheel in frustration . But that would have been foolish . " What is the point of renting mobile phones to tourists if they 're not going to be able to use them ? " She put the phone away , took a deep breath . To calm herself , she closed her eyes , tilted her head back , and allowed herself two minutes of rest . The rain lashed the windows like whips , the wind continued its feral howl . At jolting intervals the thick darkness was split by yet another lance of blue-edged lightning . But Kayleen sat quietly , her dark hair still tidy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mouth , full and shapely , gradually relaxed its tight line . When she opened her eyes , blue as the lightning that ripped the sky , they were calm again . She rolled her shoulders , took one last cleansing breath , then eased the car forward . As she did , she heard someonesomethingwhisper her name . Kayleen . Instinctively , she glanced to the side , out the rain-spattered window , into the gloom . And there , for an instant , she saw a shadow take shape , the shape of a man . Eyes , green as glass , glittered . She hit the brakes , jerking forward as the car slid in the mud . Her heart raced , her fingers shook . Have you dreamed of me ? Will you ? Fighting fear , she quickly lowered the window , leaned out into the driving rain . " Please . Can you help me ? I seem to be lost . " But there was no one there . No one who wouldcouldhave said , so low and sad , So am I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger she jabbed the button to send the window back up . Just her imagination , just fatigue playing tricks . There was no man standing in the forest in a storm . No man who knew her name . It was just the sort of foolishness her mother would have dreamed up . The woman lost in the enchanted forest , in a dramatic storm , and the handsome man , most likely a prince under a spell , who rescued her . Well , Kayleen Brennan could rescue herself , thank you very much . And there were no spellbound princes , only shadows in the rain . But her heart rapped like a fist against her ribs . With her breath coming fast , she hit the gas again . She would get off of this damned road , and she would get to where she intended to be . When she got there , she would drink an entire pot of tea while sitting neck-deep in a hot bath . And all of this .... inconvenience would be behind her . She tried to laugh it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to her mother , who would have enjoyed every moment of the experience . An adventure , she would say . Kayleen ! You finally had an adventure ! " Well , I do n't want a damn adventure . I want a hot bath . I want a roof over my head and a civilized meal . " She was getting worked up again , and this time she could n't seem to stop . " Wo n't somebody please help me get where I 'm supposed to be ! " In answer , lightning shot down , a three-pronged pitchfork hurled out of the heavens . The blast of it exploded the dark into blinding light . As she threw up an arm to shield her eyes , she saw , standing like a king in the center of the road , a huge buck . Its hide was violently white in the slash of her headlights , its rack gleaming silver . And its eyes , cool and gold , met her terrified ones through the rain . She swerved , stomped on the brakes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propelled by the swirling fog . She heard a screamit had to be her ownbefore the car ran hard into a tree . And so she dreamed . Of running through the forest while the rain slapped down like angry fingers . Eyes , it seemed a thousand of them , watched her through the gloom . She fled , stumbling in the muck stirred up by the storm , her bones jolting as she fell . Her head was full of sound . The roar of the wind , the booming warning of thunder . And under it a thousand voices chanting . She wept , and did n't know why . It was n't the fear , but something else , something that wanted to be wrenched out of her heart as a splinter is wrenched from an aching finger . She remembered nothing , neither name nor placeonly that she had to find her way . Had to find it before it was too late . There was the light , the single ball of it glowing in the dark . She ran toward it , her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , down her face . The ground sucked at her shoes . Another fall tore her sweater . She felt the quick burn on her flesh and , favoring her left arm , scrambled up again . Winded , aching , lost , she continued at a limping run . The light was her focus . If only she could make it to the light , everything would be all right again . Somehow . A spear of lightning struck close , so close she felt it sear the air , felt it drench the night with the hot sting of ozone . And in its afterglow she saw that the light was a single beam , from a single window in the tower of a castle . Of course there would be a castle . It seemed not odd at all that there should be a castle with its tower light glowing in the middle of the woods during a raging storm . Her weeping became laughter , wild as the night , as she stumbled toward it , tramping through rivers of flowers . She fell against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped a fist against it . The sound was swallowed by the storm . " Please , " she murmured . " Oh , please , let me in . " By the fire , he 'd fallen into the twilight-sleep he was allowed , had dreamed in the flames he 'd set to blazeof his dark-haired maid , coming to him . But her eyes had been frightened , and her cheeks pale as ice . He 'd slept through the storm , through the memories that often haunted him even in that drifting place . But when she had come into those dreams , when she had turned those eyes on him , he stirred . And spoke her name . And jolted awake , that name sliding out of his mind again . The fire had burned down nearly to embers now . He could have set it roaring again with a thought , but did n't bother . In any case , it was nearly time . He saw by the pretty crystal clock on the ancient stone mantelhe was amused by such anachronismsthat it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stroke . For seven days , and seven nights , he would be . Not just a shadow in a world of dreams , but flesh , blood , and bone . He lifted his arms , threw back his head , and waited to become . The world trembled , and the clock struck midnight . There was pain . He welcomed it like a lover . Oh , God , to feel . Cold burned his skin . Heat scorched it . His throat opened , and there was the blessed bliss of thirst . He opened his eyes . Colors sprang out at him , clear and true , without that damning mist that separated him for all the other time . Lowering his hands , he laid one on the back of his chair , felt the soft brush of velvet . He smelled the smoke from the fire , the rain that pounded outside and snuck in through his partially open window . His senses were battered , so overwhelmed with the rush of sensations that he nearly swooned . And even that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound that he felt rumble up from his belly . And fisting his hands , he raised them yet again . " I am . " Even as he claimed himself , as the walls echoed with his voice , he heard the pounding at the door . Jolted , he lowered his arms , turned toward a sound he 'd not heard in five hundred years . Then it was joined by another . " Please . " And it was his dream who shouted . " Oh , please , let me in . " A trick , he thought . Why would he be tortured with tricks now ? He would n't tolerate it . Not now . Not during his week to be . He threw out a hand , sent lights blazing . Furious , he strode out of the room , down the corridor , down the circling pie shaped stairs . They would not be allowed to infringe on his week . It was a breach of the sentence . He would not lose a single hour of the little time he had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath . And appeared again in the great hall . He wrenched open the door . Met the fury of the storm with fury of his own . And saw her . He stared , transfixed . He lost his breath , his mind . His heart . She had come . She looked at him , a smile trembling on her lips and sending the dimple at the corner of her mouth to winking . " There you are , " she said . And fainted at his feet .
