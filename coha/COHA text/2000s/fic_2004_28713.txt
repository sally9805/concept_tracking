Chapter One The way I see it , life is a jelly doughnut . You do n't really know what it 's about until you bite into it . And then , just when you decide it 's good , you drop a big glob of jelly on your best T-shirt . My name is Stephanie Plum , and I drop a lot of jelly globs , figuratively and literally . Like the time I accidentally burned down a funeral home . That was the mother of all jelly globs . I got my picture in the paper for that one . I 'd walk down the street and people would recognize me . " You 're famous now , " my mother said when the paper came out . " You have to set an example . You have to exercise , eat good food and be nice to old people . " Okay , so my mother was probably right , but I 'm from Jersey and truth is , I have a hard time getting a grip on the good example thing . A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to mention , I inherited a lot of unmanageable brown hair and rude hand gestures from my father 's Italian side of the family . What am I supposed to do with that ? My mother 's side is Hungarian and from this I get blue eyes and the ability to eat birthday cake and still button the top snap on my jeans . I 'm told the good Hungarian metabolism only lasts until I 'm forty , so I 'm counting down . The Hungarian genes also carry a certain amount of luck and gypsy intuition , both of which I need in my present job . I 'm a Bond Enforcement Agent , working for my cousin Vincent Plum , and I run down bad guys . I 'm not the best BEA in the world and I 'm not the worst . An incredibly hot guy with the street name Ranger is the best . And my sometimes partner , Lula , is possibly the worst . Maybe it 's not fair to have Lula in the running for worst bounty hunter of all time . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there . And more to the point , Lula is n't actually a bounty hunter . Lula is a former hooker who was hired to do the filing for the bail bonds office but spends a lot of her day trailing after me . At the moment , Lula and I were standing in the parking lot of a deli-mart on Hamilton Avenue . We were about a half-mile from the office and we were leaning against my yellow Ford Escape , trying to make a lunch choice . We were debating nachos at the deli-mart against a sub at Giovichinni 's . " Hey , " I said to Lula . " What happened to the filing job ? Who does the filing now ? " " I do the filing . I file the ass out of that office . " " You 're never in the office . " " The hell I am . I was in the office when you showed up this morning . " " Yeah , but you were n't filing . You were doing your nails . " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my help going to look for that loser , Roger Banker , I 'd still be filing . " Roger was accused of grand theft auto and possession of controlled substances . In layman 's terms , Roger got high and went joy riding . " So you 're still officially a file clerk ? " " Heck no , " Lula said . " That 's so-o-o boring . Do I look like a file clerk to you ? " Actually , Lula still looked like a hooker . Lula 's a full-bodied black woman who favors animal print spandex enhanced with sequins . I figured Lula did n't want to hear my fashion opinion , so I did n't say anything . I just raised an eyebrow . " The job title is tricky since I do a lot of this here bounty hunter work but I 've never really been given any of my own paper work , " Lula said . " I suppose I could be your body guard . " " Omigod . " Lula narrowed her eyes at me . " You got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Hollywood . " " Yeah , but sometimes you need some extra fire power , right ? And there I am . Hell , you do n't even carry a gun half the time . I always got a gun . I got a gun now . Just in case . " And Lula pulled a 40 caliber Glock out of her purse . " I do n't mind using it either . I 'm good with a gun . I got an eye for it . Watch me hit that bottle next to the bike . " Someone had leaned a fancy red mountain bike against the big plate glass window in the front of the deli-mart . There was a quart bottle next to the bike . The bottle had a rag stuffed into it . " No , " I said . " No shooting ! " Too late . Lula squeezed off a shot , missed the bottle and destroyed the bike 's rear tire . " Oops , " Lula said on a grimace , immediately returning the gun to her purse . A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing a mechanics jumpsuit and a red devil mask . He had a small backpack slung over one shoulder and he had a gun in his right hand . His skin tone was darker than mine but lighter than Lula 's . He grabbed the bottle off the ground , lit the rag with a flick of his Bic and threw the bottle into the store . He turned to get onto the bike and realized his tire was blown to smithereens . " Fuck , " the guy said . " FUCK ! " " I did n't do it , " Lula said . " Was n't me . Someone came along and shot up your tire . You must not be popular . " There was a lot of shouting inside the store , the guy in the devil mask turned to flee and Victor , the Pakistani day manager , rushed out the door . " I am done ! Do you hear me ? " Victor yelled . " This is the fourth robbery this month and I wo n't stand for any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy in the mask . " Dog excrement . " Lula had her hand back in her purse . " Hold on . I got a gun ! " she said . " Where the hell is it ? Why ca n't you ever find the damn gun when you need it ? " Victor threw the still lit but clearly unbroken bottle at the guy in the devil mask , hitting him in the back of the head . The bottle bounced off the devil 's head and smashed against my driver 's side door . The devil staggered , and instinctively pulled the mask off . Maybe he could n't breathe , or maybe he went to feel for blood , or maybe he just was n't thinking . Whatever the reason , the mask was only off for a second , before being yanked back over the guy 's head . He turned and looked directly at me , and then he ran across the street and disappeared into the alley between two buildings . The bottle instantly ignited when it hit my car , and flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Holy crap , " Lula said , looking up from her purse . " Damn . " " Why me ? " I shrieked . " Why does this always happen to me ? I ca n't believe this car is on fire . My cars are always getting exploded . How many cars have I lost like this since you 've known me ? " " A lot , " Lula said . " It 's embarrassing . What am I going to tell my insurance company ? " " It was n't your fault , " Lula said . " It 's never my fault . Do they care ? I do n't think they care ! " " You got bad car karma , " Lula said . " But at least you 're lucky at love . " For the last couple months I 've been living with Joe Morelli . Morelli 's a very sexy , very handsome Trenton cop . Morelli and I have a long history and possibly a long future . Mostly we take it day by day , neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good thing about living with a cop is that you never have to call home when disaster strikes . As you might suspect , that 's also the bad part . Seconds after the emergency call goes in on the robbery and car fire , describing my yellow Escape , at least forty different cops , EMTs , and fire fighters will track Morelli down and tell him his girlfriend 's done it again . Lula and I moved further from the fire , knowing from experience that an explosion was a possibility . We stood patiently waiting , listening to the sirens whining in the distance , getting closer by the second . Morelli 's unmarked cop car would be minutes behind the sirens . And somewhere in the mix of emergency vehicles my professional mentor and man of mystery , Ranger , would slide in to check things out . " Maybe I should leave , " Lula said . " There 's all that filing back at the office . And cops give me the runs . " Not to mention she was illegally carrying a concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see the guy 's face when he pulled his mask off ? " I asked her . " No . I was looking for my gun . I missed that . " " Then leaving might be a good idea , " I said . " Get me a sub on the way back to the office . I do n't think they 'll be making nachos here for awhile . " " I 'd rather have the sub anyways . A car fire always gives me an appetite . " And Lula took off power walking . Victor was on the other side of the car , stomping around and pulling at his hair . He stopped stomping and fixed his attention on me . " Why did n't you shoot him ? I know you . You are a bounty hunter . You should have shot him . " " I 'm not carrying a gun , " I told Victor . " Not carrying a gun ? What kind of bounty hunter , are you ? I watch television . I know about these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shooting people is a no-no in bond enforcement . " Victor shook his head . " I do n't know what this world is coming to when bounty hunters do n't shoot people . " A blue and white patrol car arrived and two uniforms got out and stood hands on hips , taking it all in . I knew both cops . Andy Zajak and Robin Russell . Andy Zajak was riding shotgun . Two months ago he 'd been plain clothes , but he 'd asked a local politician some embarrassing questions during a robbery investigation and had gotten busted back to uniform . It could have been worse . Zajak could have been assigned to a desk in the tower of Irrelevance . Sometimes things could get tricky in the Trenton police department . Zajak waved when he saw me . He said something to Russell , and they both smiled . No doubt enjoying the continuing calamitous exploits of Stephanie Plum . I 'd gone to school with Robin Russell . She was a year behind me , so we were n't the closest of friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic when she was in high school . She was one of the quiet brainy kids . And she surprised everyone when she joined Trenton P.D . two years ago . A fire truck followed Zajak and Russell . Plus two more cop cars and an EMT truck . By the time Morelli arrived the hoses and chemical extinguishers were already out and in use . Morelli angled his car behind Robin Russell 's and walked across to me . Morelli was lean and hard muscled with wary cop eyes that softened in the bedroom . His hair was almost black , falling in waves over his forehead , brushing his collar . He was wearing a slightly over-sized blue shirt with the sleeves rolled , black jeans and black boots with a Vibram sole . He had his gun on his hip and , with or without the gun , he did n't look like someone you 'd want to mess with . There was a tilt to his mouth that could pass for a smile . Then again , it could just as easily be a grimace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , " I told him . This got a genuine smile from him . " Cupcake , it 's never your fault . " His eyes traveled to the red mountain bike with the destroyed tire . " What 's with the bike ? " " Lula accidentally shot the tire . Then a guy wearing a red devil mask ran out of the store , took a look at the bike , tossed a Molotov cocktail into the store and set off on foot . The bottle did n't break so Victor pitched it at the devil . The bottle bounced off the devil 's head and crashed against my car . " I did n't hear the part about Lula shooting the tire . " " Yeah , I figured it was n't necessary to mention that in the official statement . " I looked past Morelli , as a black Porsche 911 Turbo pulled to the curb . There were n't a lot of people in Trenton who could afford the car . Mostly high-level drug dealers ... and Ranger . I watched as Ranger angled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same height as Morelli , but he had more bulk to his muscle . Morelli was a cat . Ranger was Rambo meets Batman . Ranger was in S.W.A.T. black cargo pants and T-shirt . His hair was dark , and his eyes were dark , and his skin reflected his Cuban ancestry . No one knew Ranger 's age , but I 'd guess it was close to mine . Late twenties to early thirties . No one knew where Ranger lived or where his cars and cash originated . Probably it was best not to know . Ranger nodded to Morelli and locked eyes with me . Sometimes it felt like Ranger could look you in the eye and know all the stuff that was inside your head . It was a little unnerving , but it saved a lot of time since talk was n't necessary . " Babe , " Ranger said . And he left . Morelli watched Ranger get into his Porsche and take off . " Half the time I 'm happy to have him watching over you . And half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always in black , the address on his driver 's license is a vacant lot , and he never says anything . " " Maybe he has a dark history ... like Batman . A tortured soul . " " Tortured soul ? Ranger ? Cupcake , the guy 's a mercenary . " Morelli playfully twirled a strand of my hair around his finger . " You 've been watching Dr. Phil again , right ? Oprah ? Geraldo ? Crossing Over with John Edward ? " " Crossing Over with John Edward . And Ranger 's not a mercenary . At least not officially in Trenton . He 's a bounty hunter ... like me . " " Yeah , and I really hate that you 're a bounty hunter . " Okay . I know I have a crappy job . The money is n't all that great and sometimes people shoot at me . Still , someone 's got to make sure the accused show up in court . " I do a service for the community , " I told Morelli . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to track these guys . The tax payer would have to foot the bill for a larger police force . " " I 'm not disputing the job . I just do n't want you doing it . " There was a loud phooonf sound from the underside of my car , flames shot out and a steaming tire popped off and rolled across the lot . " This is the fourteenth Red Devil robbery , " Morelli said . " The routine is always the same . Rob the store at gun-point . Get away on a bike . Cover your get-away with a bottle bomb . No one 's ever seen enough to ID him . " " Until now , " I said . " I saw the guy 's face . I did n't recognize him , but I think I could pick him out of a line-up . " * * * An hour later , Morelli dropped me off at the bond office . He snagged me by the back of my shirt as I was leaving his unmarked seen-better-days Crown Vic cop car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Right . " " And you 're not going to let Lula do any more shooting . " I did a mental sigh . He was asking the impossible . " Sometimes it 's hard to control Lula . " " Then get a different partner . " " Ranger ? " " Very funny , " Morelli said . He French kissed me good-by , and I thought probably I could control Lula . When Morelli kissed me , I thought anything was possible . Morelli was a terrific kisser . His pager buzzed and he pulled away to check the read-out . " I have to go , " he said , shoving me out the door . I leaned in the window at him . " Remember , we promised my mom we 'd come for dinner tonight . " " No way . You promised . I did n't promise . I had dinner at your parent 's house three days ago and once a week is my limit . Valerie and the kids will be there , right ? And Kloughn ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that crew should get combat pay . " He was right . I had no comeback . A little over a year ago my sister 's husband took off for parts unknown with the babysitter . Continues ...
