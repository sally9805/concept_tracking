Saturday , November 1 <p> Rain or shine , that 's what Ivy Rose had put in the yard-sale ad . What they 'd gotten was a metallic gray sky and gusty winds . But the typical , contrary New England fall weather had n't discouraged this crowd . <p> David moved aside the sawhorse that blocked the driveway , and buyers surged in . It seemed to Ivy that their Victorian ark tolerated the invasion the way a great white whale might float to the surface and permit birds to pick parasites off its back . <p> For three years Ivy had been oblivious to the dusty piles of junk left behind by elderly Paul Vlaskovic , the previous owner , a cadaverous fellow whom David referred to as Vlad . The clutter that filled their attic and basement might as well have existed in a parallel universe . Then , as sudden as a spring thunderstorm , the urge to expel what was n't theirs had risen up in her until she could no longer stand it . Out ! David had had the good grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to blame it on hormones . <p> Ivy felt the baby 's firm kick-no more moth-wing flutter . Hello there , Sprout . She rested her palms on her belly , for the moment solid as a rock . With just three weeks to go until she either gave birth or exploded , Ivy was supposed to be having contractions . Braxton Hicks . False labor . The revving of an engine , not quite juiced up enough to turn over . <p> She and David had reached the obsessing-about-a-name stage , and she wondered how many other soon-to-be parents had tossed around the name Braxton . <p> Viable , viable , viable . The word whispered itself over and over in her head . She 'd married at twenty-four , and then it had taken five years to conceive . Three times she 'd miscarried-the last time at twenty weeks , just when she 'd thought it was safe to stop holding her breath . <p> David came up alongside her and put his arm around where she 'd once had a waist . A fully pregnant belly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squash . <p> " Hey , Stretch " - the nickname had taken on an entirely new connotation in these final months-looks like we have ignition . Quite a crowd , " he said . She shivered with pleasure as he pushed her hair to one side and nuzzled her neck . <p> Ivy loved the way David gave off the aroma of rich , loamy soil , the way his thatch of auburn hair seemed to go in twelve directions at once , and most of all the way his smile took over his face and crinkled his eyes . The broken nose he 'd gotten playing college football , after surviving unscathed for two years as quarterback in high school , gave his sweet face character . <p> She was more what people called " interesting-looking-dark soulful eyes , too long in the nose , and a mouth that was a bit too generous to be considered pretty . Most days she paid little attention to her looks . She rolled out of bed , brushed her teeth , ran a comb through long , thick , chestnut-colored hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because we have this great old house , we have great old stuff , " Ivy said . <p> David twiddled an invisible cigar and Groucho Marxed his eyebrows at a pair of black telephones with rotary dials . " Little do they know ... " <p> Ivy waved at a fellow yard-sale junkie , Ralph of the battered black Ford pickup , who was crouched over a box of electrical fixtures . Beside him , amid the tumult , stood Corinne Bindel , their elderly next-door neighbor , her bouffant too platinum and puffy to be real . Her arms were folded across the front of her brown tweed coat . The pained expression on her face said she could n't imagine why anyone would pay a nickel for any of this junk . <p> " What do you say ? " David asked . " After the dust settles , we set up some of the baby things ? " <p> " Not yet , " Ivy said . She rubbed the cobalt blue stone set in the hand-shaped silver good-luck charm that hung from a chain around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . She knew that it was silly superstition , but she wanted all of the baby things tucked away in the spare room until the baby arrived and had had each of her fingers and toes counted and kissed . <p> " Excuse me ? " said a woman who peered at Ivy from under the brim of a Red Sox cap . She held a lime green Depression glass swan-shaped dish that had been in a box of wax fruit that mice had gotten to . <p> " You can have that for fifteen , " Ivy said . " Not a chip or crack on it . " <p> " Ivy ? " The woman with cinnamon curls , streaked silvery blond , had a mildly startled look . " Do n't remember me , do you ? " <p> " I ... " Ivy hesitated . There was something familiar about this woman who wore a cotton maternity top , patterned in blue cornflowers and yellow black-eyed Susans . Her hand , the nails polished pink and perfectly sculpted , rested on her own belly . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , " the woman said . " Melinda back then . " <p> Melinda White-the name conjured the memory of a chubby girl from elementary school . Frizzy brown hair , glasses , and a pasty complexion . It was hard to believe that this was the same person . <p> " Of course I remember you . Wow , do n't you look great ! And congratulations . Your first ? " Ivy asked . <p> Melinda nodded and took a step closer . She smiled . Her once-crooked teeth were now straight and perfect . " Is n't this your first , too ? " <p> Ivy avoided her probing look . <p> " I 'm due Thanksgiving , " Melinda said . " How ' bout you ? " <p> " December , " Ivy said . In fact , she was expecting a Thanksgiving baby , too . But Ivy had told everyone , even her best friend , Jody , that her due date was two weeks later . As the end approached , it would be enough to deal with just her and David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether something would go wrong this time . <p> Melinda tilted her head and considered Ivy . " Happy marriage . Baby due any minute . You guys are so lucky . I mean , what more could you ask for ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
