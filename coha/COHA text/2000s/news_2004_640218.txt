<p> Changing regimes <p> Re : ' U.S. tries to broker deal to avert bloody clash for Haiti 's capital , ' Feb. 24 news story . <p> Do you think Colin Powell listens to himself ? To quote him , ' we can not support a government that comes to power through violence . ' <p> Hello ? Does ' regime change ' ring any bells ? <p> Well , gee , then what does he think about dealing with a new Iraqi government ? He supported the violent overthrow of its previous government on false pretenses . Or Afghanistan , ditto . Or Liberia , where we support the civil war to toss out Charles Taylor ? Or Nicaragua , where we supported the Contras to pressure the Sandinistas with violence ? Or Venezuela , where we 'd love to see Hugo Chavez booted , violently or otherwise ? Or a well , you get the idea . <p> I can think of one more regime change that would make the world a safer place . Vote out Bush , and all the zealots driving our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to pare deficit <p> Re : ' Fed chief : Trim benefits ; Boomers ' Social Security will worsen deficits , Congress told , ' Feb. 26 news story . <p> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 's call for Social Security benefit cuts has been met with skepticism and , in some cases , derision . However , targeted cuts , coupled with other reforms , could eliminate Social Security 's long-term deficit while maintaining , or even improving , benefits for most retirees . How ? <p> About 5 million of America 's state and local government workers ( 3.5 percent of the total labor force ) are exempt from Social Security tax . By requiring newly hired state and local government workers to join Social Security , we could eliminate about 11 percent of Social Security 's pending actuarial deficit . <p> The current method of taxing benefits is illogical , inequitable and confusing . If we start taxing Social Security benefits the same way we tax other pension benefits , as much as 24 percent of the actuarial deficit could be eliminated . <p> We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at-home spouses . Spousal and survivor benefits are extra benefits because they are acquired via marriage - not by the payment of Social Security tax . ' Means testing ' those extra benefits ( to eliminate them for the wealthiest 30 percent of workers ) could eliminate up to 60 percent of the actuarial deficit . <p> The three changes listed above would eliminate about 95 percent of the long-term Social Security shortfall , but one more reform is needed . Workers should be given the option of putting part of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts ( PRAs ) . A modest PRA plan could increase retirement wealth significantly , help bridge the gap between rich and poor ( by giving low-income workers a chance to bequeath assets to their children ) , and improve labor productivity ( because workers would be motivated to accumulate real assets in their own accounts ) . <p> JOSEPH FRIED <p> Cleveland <p> The writer is a certified public account and director of the Public Program Testing Organization . <p> Occam 's razor at play <p> One has to admire Alan Greenspan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mounting federal deficits are threatening the government 's ability to pay Social Security retirement benefits . <p> The solution : Stop paying the benefits . <p> Do I see Dogbert 's tail wagging ? <p> KARL SUTTERFIELD <p> Eastlake <p> News we can use <p> So , Alan Greenspan laid it on the table : Bush 's wars are going to be paid from my Social Security retirement . And he gives us this awful news ahead of the election . Thanks ! <p> PETE KLAMMER <p> Wheat Ridge <p> New blood needed <p> Re : ' A reality check for the Sierra Club , ' Feb. 25 Al Knight column . <p> Al Knight correctly reported that until fairly recently , the Sierra Club responsibly endorsed U.S. population stabilization with measured , sustainable immigration levels . Then came political correctness , mass immigration , a rumored $ 5 million buy-off to keep population matters off the club 's agenda , more corrupting millions in corporate money , and the club 's board took an abrupt about-face and assumed a ' neutral ' immigration/population policy . <p> The club now treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring global solutions , dismissing the environmental imperative ' think globally , act locally . ' The bosses at the Sierra Club understand that deforestation is a global issue , but they are n't waiting for some global deforestation cure . Nope . They are litigating , lobbying and exhorting locally , not globally . <p> Just who are these ' insurgent candidates ' for seats on the club 's board , cited in newspapers stories as ' misanthropes ' and ' racists ' and holding ' anti-human views ' ? They are Cornell University professor David Pimentel , a modest , unassuming humanitarian and one of the world 's most important environmental scientists ; Dr. Frank Morris , a sweet , soft-spoken , gentle man , a longtime civil rights activist , a scholar , educator and the former director of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation ; and Colorado 's former three-term governor , Dick Lamm , who , as a young lawyer , cut his legal teeth on civil rights and environmental law . <p> The idea that these three could collectively generate even a single calorie of misanthropy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regime change , indeed , must come to the Sierra Club . <p> PAUL KARMI <p> Carbondale <p> Answer this question <p> Immigration opponents always scream and yell about allegiance to law , because to do otherwise would accentuate the obvious - their entrenched belief that some people are just innately subservient and unworthy of the benefits of a system that allows them to work and support a family . But everyone knows that laws are often immoral and irrational . <p> If Al Knight can answer in affirmative one simple question , then he can honestly claim the moral high ground . The question is this : Are you willing to watch your children go hungry rather than do everything in your power to make their lives better in order to avoid violating the laws of a foreign country ? If Knight can honestly answer ' yes , ' then he has an absolute right to spout his vitriol about immigration policy to his heart 's desire . But I hardly think his family will relish his bold stance . If his answer is ' no , ' then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for behavior he would engage in himself . <p> MICHAEL HARRIS <p> Colorado Springs <p> To Reach Us <p> Phone : 303-820-1331 <p> Fax : 303-820-1502 <p> E-mail : openforum@denverpost.com ( Please send straight text , not attachments . ) <p> Mail : The Open Forum , The Denver Post , 1560 Broadway , Denver 80202 ; or P.O.

I would like to propose a solution to getting the government off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon , by law , the president must be a Marionite Christian , the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of the legislature a Shiite Muslim . By analogy , in Iraq a law could be passed that would make the president a Shiite Muslim , the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of the legislature a Kurd . <p> Thus , each of the main political groups in the country would have a strong voice in the government from day one . Each group could keep a wary eye on the others and immediately be in a position to have their political ideas heard in a democratic context . <p> There would then be a general election to a legislature of some kind , perhaps unicameral , and probably the Shiites would win a majority of the seats since they represent 60 percent of the population . At least they would not be able to assume dictatorial powers and ' get even ' with the Sunni minority that made their lives miserable for so many years . <p> THOMAS GNEWUCH <p> Dillon
