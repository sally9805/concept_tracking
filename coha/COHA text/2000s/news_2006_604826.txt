<p> BALTIMORE  --  When Taylor Branch began writing a history of the U.S. civil rights movement , he planned one book that would take three years . <p> Twenty-four years , three books , 2,849 pages and one Pulitzer Prize later , he has reached a historian 's version of the promised land . <p> At Canaan 's Edge : America in the King Years 1965-68 ( Simon &; Schuster , $35 ) , the final volume in Branch 's monumental series , is out this week . The title , as with Branch 's earlier works , Parting the Waters ( 1988 ) and Pillar of Fire ( 1998 ) , comes from the Book of Exodus . The scope is nearly biblical , although the complex portrait of Martin Luther King Jr . is far from saintly . <p> Branch , who turns 59 on Saturday , has mixed feelings about the end of what he calls " the blessing of a life 's work . " At his home in Baltimore , he feels " giddy , relieved , a sense of loss and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has . " <p> The civil rights struggle , with all its peaks and valleys , still offers political and moral lessons , he believes , but he does n't like to lecture . Branch prefers being a storyteller and letting readers draw their own conclusions . <p> He does say that the more he has learned about King , the more he admires him , as a politician who never ran for office and as a preacher driven by a sense of guilt . <p> " He really was a threatening character , " Branch says . " Many of those close to him were not comfortable with him , but his oratory transcended that . I found no one who criticized him for mixing church and state . He fused the language of religion and politics without being dogmatic about either . " <p> Branch never met King , never even saw him speak or preach , although they shared a hometown : Atlanta . <p> As a teenager , Branch was n't " blind to what was happening , " but kept a safe distance from civil rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but maybe someday , when I was more established . " <p> At 16 , he watched TV coverage of protests in Birmingham , where 8-year-old black girls faced fire hoses and police dogs . " It was a pivotal moment . I remember my stupefaction , my questions about where did this come from ? " <p> It 's the same basic question his books aim to answer . <p> As a student at the University of North Carolina , Branch joined protests against the Vietnam War , not the civil rights movement . <p> Later , " my first original idea " was that anti-war activists " covered the civil rights movement the way Pat Boone covered Little Richard , " using " cover " the way musicians do when someone comes along and sings someone else 's song . <p> " We foolishly underestimated its complexity and need for discipline and self-sacrifice . " <p> At Canaan 's Edge reaffirms the radical power of non-violence , but the book begins and ends with violence . It opens with a vivid description of armed Klansmen surrounding a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It ends three years later as King is assassinated on a motel balcony in Memphis : " King stood still for once , and his sojourn on earth went blank . " <p> The book is not a biography , although King holds the story together much in the way he held together the civil rights movement . It 's a narrative with scores of characters , famous and little known . It constantly shifts from Selma to Vietnam , from the White House to turmoil within King 's inner circle . <p> It deals with King 's adultery and depression and with the FBI 's campaign to harass and blackmail him . It mines President Johnson 's secret White House tapes and the FBI 's wiretaps of King . Branch says it 's ironic that " something so evil would become so useful " to a historian re-creating that era . <p> In style and structure , Branch was influenced by Shelby Foote 's The Civil War , a three-volume , novel-like military history that " made you feel like you were part of it , " Branch says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers sympathize with Sherman . " <p> At Canaan 's Edge is apt to prompt readers to sympathize with both King , who was whipsawed by conflicts within the movement , and Johnson , the reluctant warrior , whose alliance with King on civil rights was destroyed by King 's growing opposition to the escalation of the Vietnam War . <p> Branch says he tried to make the story " as personal and as human as possible . " He 's not the first to reveal King 's extramarital affairs but discloses that , in early 1965 , King confessed to his wife , Coretta , about " the one mistress who meant most to him ... with intensity almost like a second family . The result was painful disaster . " <p> Branch sees a connection " between one 's private life and one 's public life , but it 's very complicated . I do n't believe that because someone is a flawed philanderer , that makes that person a hypocrite in everything he does or says . " <p> He also suggests that King 's self-reproach and penance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " may have driven him to take risks he otherwise would n't have . <p> Branch took his own and lesser risks in a brief taste of the civil rights movement that accidentally led to his career as a writer . <p> As a graduate student at Princeton 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs , he spent the summer of 1969 working for the Voter Education Project , an Atlanta-based civil rights group . <p> He was assigned to make contacts in rural Georgia , where most blacks still were not registered to vote : " I really did n't know what I was doing . I felt so stupid . " <p> He found most local black leaders too intimidated to challenge the status quo , so he tried recruiting in illegal bars and gambling dens known as juke joints . <p> He was in Bubba-Doo 's Big Apple in Cuthbert when the sheriff of Rudolph County stopped by for his take of the profits , Branch says . The sheriff asked what a white boy was doing in place like that . <p> Branch says he was arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate , heard a Princeton student was in jail . Branch recalls his words : " No Princeton man belongs in jail , even if you are a communist . " <p> With such stories , Branch compiled a diary about his summer , rather than the policy analysis he was supposed to write . A professor sent the diary to Charles Peters , editor of a new political magazine , The Washington Monthly , which published portions of Branch 's diary in three issues . <p> " I did n't write it to be published , but I became a published writer . " He went on to work at Washington Monthly , Harper 's and Esquire . <p> When he approached Alice Mayhew , a legendary editor at Simon &; Schuster , about a civil rights book , she rejected his proposal and advised him to get more experience . <p> He did , ghostwriting an autobiography of Watergate figure John Dean and co-authoring basketball star Bill Russell 's . <p> In 1982 , he signed a book deal with Mayhew , who has remained his editor ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure what he 'll do next . He does n't rule out a book about his friendship with Bill Clinton . They met in the student anti-war movement and jointly ran George McGovern 's 1972 presidential campaign in Texas . <p> As president , Clinton asked Branch to help write his two inaugural addresses and to conduct a series of 89 late-night oral history interviews about his presidency that Clinton used when he wrote his memoir . <p> Branch ducks a question about comparing King 's and Clinton 's womanizing . He says he knows far more about King 's private life than about Clinton 's . <p> " It 's strange . I feel I 've spent much more time with King , whom I never met , than with Clinton , even though we had all that time together in the White House , just the two of us and a tape recorder . "
