THE CHANGING WESTERN HOME Headnote Use three easy paint techniques to transform a room Photograph // One of the simplest and most inexpensive ways to add instant style to your home is with paint . Stylist Bill Samios 's three artistic techniques shown here are all done with paint rollers and masking tape , plus other basic materials that you 'd need for any interior paint project . " With a little extra time and effort , you can add an exciting visual element to a room , " Samios says . " Anyone who can paint a room can do this . " Before starting your own project , fill and sand cracks and indentations to get a smooth work surface . Wainscoting Photograph // Additional materials three colors of paint ( Samios used two shades of blue and a complementary ivory ) three 9-inch rollers 1 1/2-inch-wide masking tape 1 .

Use the level to sketch a line where the top of your wainscoting will be . Any point near the middle of the wall is fine ; the wainscoting in the photo below is 47 inches from the floor . 3 . Starting 1 1/2 inches from one end , divide two rollers into alternating bands of taped and untaped sections of equal widths . Secure tape as tightly as possible . 4 . Using a wrapped roller and the darkest color , paint vertical lines beginning at one doorway . To maintain proper spacing , let one saturated section of the roller overlap the molding band , and for each successive set of lines , paint one line overlapping the previous one . Continue to the other doorway or the end of the wall . 5 . Using the third color and a wrapped roller , paint stripes between the darker ones . It 's okay to have rough lines . 6 .

Horizontal stripes Additional materials two colors of paint two 9-inch rollers 3-inch-wide masking tape a ruler 1 . Use a roller to paint the entire wall one color ; let dry thoroughly . 2 . Use masking tape to wrap the middle 3 inches of a roller as tightly as possible , leaving 3 inches of the roller exposed on either side , as shown in the photo above . 3 . When the base coat is completely dry , use the level to draw a horizontal guideline 3 inches up from the floor along the length of the wall . 4 . Using the wrapped roller and the second color , paint the first set of horizontal lines along the guideline . For each successive set of lines , overlap one end of the roller on the uppermost stripe in order to keep lines level . Continue to the top of the wall .

Use the width of a level to make a vertical guideline at one end of the wall , and start painting vertical lines there in the second color . For each new set of lines , paint one line overlapping the previous one to maintain even spacing . Roll as far down as you can without touching the floor with the roller . 4 . After vertical lines cover the wall , use the width of the level to sketch a horizontal guideline near the floor ( you do n't need to wait for vertical lines to dry completely ) . Paint the horizontal lines in the same fashion as the vertical ones , all the way up the wall . 5 .

To maintain exact spacing when taping rollers , wrap one piece of tape loosely around the roller , then wrap the adjacent section as tightly as possible ; repeat this process until you get to the end of the roller . Remove the loose tape before painting . When you moisten your roller in the tray , some paint will get on the taped sections ; wipe off the excess with a brush . Have extra rollers and tape on hand in case paint saturates a roller and causes the tape to come loose . Use a brush to fill in any major gaps , and to make touch-ups . Be sure to recheck your stripes periodically with a level to make sure they 're straight ; sketch new guidelines if necessary . Reference Resources Page 156 . " Rolling on Style .
