At precisely midnight Huk Kim pulled back the covers , got out of bed , and checked to make certain that the sleep agent she 'd given her Japanese roommate had n't worn off yet . But the girl was totally out of it , and in the morning she would remember very little of what had happened after their dinner in the hotel 's dining room two , and absolutely nothing after her head had hit the pillow . <p> Kim was a thirty- one- year- old , short , slightly built South Korean woman , and her movements were quick , almost birdlike as she tied a folded plastic trash bag around her waist with shaking hands , then dressed in dark slacks , a lightweight dark pullover , and sneakers . <p> She was frightened to the core , as she had been on the previous kills , but she had no way out , short of leaving her husband , something she could n't even conceive of doing . <p> Checking a second time to make certain her roommate was deep asleep , Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the end of the deserted corridor , then downstairs to a ser vice area at the rear of the hotel where deliveries were made each morning between four and seven . From there she was able to get outside without being seen , something that would have been impossible from the lobby . <p> The evening was pleasantly warm , and almost totally dark and silent . Other than the few lights around the hotel , and a few on the bridge across the river , North Korea 's capital Pyongyang lay sleeping in darkness , only a pinprick of light here and there to hint that a city of more than two million people existed less than two hundred meters away . <p> She shivered . She loved her husband and the fabulous money they were making together , but she hated the work , doing it only for him . Assassinations were usually carried out at night so that the shooters could get away . After five hits in three years , Kim had learned to depend on the dark but she hated it . <p> Keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led up to the single road circling the small island of Yanggak , then held up in the bushes and hedges to wait for her husband , and to watch for the policemen who traveled on foot in pairs . <p> Yanggakdo International Hotel was the city 's only accommodation for unapproved foreigners , such as South Koreans or Japanese , and for everyone who came into North Korea in a tour group . No one was allowed out of the hotel or off the island after dark , and the road and two bridges leading across the river to the mainland were patrolled 24/7 by special police armed with short stock versions of the AK- 47 assault rifle . <p> A dark figure darted up from the ser vice driveway , and Kim eased farther into the hedges until she was certain it was her husband Soon , then she showed herself and he came across to her . <p> " Any signs of the cops ? " he asked , keeping his voice low . <p> " Not yet , " she said . <p> They pulled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscled with a square face and dark almond eyes that Kim had always found devastatingly attractive . They 'd met six years ago when she 'd been assigned as a brand- new second lieutenant to his South Korean Special Forces Sniper Unit outside Seoul . She always smiled when she thought about the exact moment she 'd first laid eyes on him , handsome in his captain 's uniform , self-assured , even cocky . She 'd fallen instantly in love with him , and had told him so on the spot . <p> They began sleeping together that weekend , but regulations would not permit them to be married or to even have an affair . Two years later they resigned their commissions , got married in Chinhae , the small town on the south coast where she was born , and started to look for work , finding it almost immediately as assassins for hire by South Korea 's Mafia . <p> She had been trained for urban warfare assassinations , but killing enemies of South Korea was a completely different thing than killing rival businessmen or gang leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute of it , but loved her husband more . <p> Soon pointed two fingers at his eyes and then through the hedges at a pair of figures slowly approaching along the path on the other side of the road , and Kim 's stomach did a slow roll . <p> There had been no possible way for them to bring weapons here , so before Soon had agreed to take the hit he and Kim had spent the better part of a week cooped up in their apartment doing research online , finally coming up with a plan that could work if they ran into no snags . She 'd tried to talk him out of it , arguing that if anything went wrong , if they made even one mistake , they would pay with their lives . <p> " I do n't want to lose you , " she 'd pleaded , but he 'd laughed and took her in his arms . <p> " Not a chance , " he 'd whispered in her ear . <p> When the police reached a spot directly across the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless . One of the cops lit a cigarette , the odor of cheap tobacco wafting on the slight breeze , then they continued down the path . <p> Kim and Soon crawled through the hedges , careful to make no noise . Keeping low , they raced across the road and onto the path directly behind the cops . <p> She 'd been trained in the Army for this part too , though in practice she 'd never had to use her skills for real . This time was different and she thought that she might be sick to her stomach at any moment . <p> One of the cops , sensing something , started to turn when Soon reached him , jammed a knee in the man 's back , and reached for his head . <p> Kim hit her target a split instant later , jumping up , slamming her knee into his back , and yanking his head back , breaking his spine and his neck . He collapsed without a sound . <p> Soon was dragging his target into the brush between the path and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his face . He was just a kid , probably a teenager , and he was still alive , but paralyzed from the neck down , making it impossible for him to breathe . She reared back , turned away , and threw up , a buzzing inside her head , the path and the road spinning out of control . <p> When she looked back , the kid 's eyes were still open but he was dead , and she was able to get a grip on herself . <p> Soon came back to her . " What are you doing ? " he demanded . <p> " He was n't dead . " <p> Soon glanced at the boy 's face . " He is now . " He grabbed the cop 's arms and dragged his slight body into the brush where it could not be spotted from the path or the road , or even from one of the windows in the top story of the hotel . No boats were on the river at this time of the night so it was unlikely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started getting undressed , and Kim pulled the balaclava off her head then took off her sneakers , her slacks , and dark pullover . She untied the plastic bag from around her waist , opened it and stuffed her clothing inside . Soon was already stripping the cop he 'd killed of everything but the man 's underwear . The uniform , belts , cap , shoes , and the AK- 47 all went into the bag . He gathered the edges and blew air into the bag , inflating it like a balloon and sealed it with one of his shoelaces . <p> When he was finished he helped Kim with hers . <p> It was just past 12:30 A.M. when they slipped into the river and started swimming toward the city , the current weak , but the water cold . <p> Excerpted from THE EXPEDITER by DAVID HAGBERG <p> Copyright 2009 by David Hagberg <p> Published in March 2009 by Torn Doherty Associates Continues ...
