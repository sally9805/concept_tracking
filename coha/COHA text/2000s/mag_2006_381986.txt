For the iPod generation , it does n't get more radical than wearing a veil . The hijab worn by traditional Muslim women might have people talking , but it 's the wimple that really turns heads . And in the U.S. today , the nuns most likely to wear that headdress are the ones young enough to have a playlist . <P> Over the past five years , Roman Catholic communities around the country have experienced a curious phenomenon : more women , most in their 20s and 30s , are trying on that veil .
