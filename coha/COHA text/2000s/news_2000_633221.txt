<p> Pointing to longtime Chicagoan Lynn Pautler , a Chinese woman tells tiny Meng Lei , " This . . . is . . . Mother . This . . . is . . . Mama . " She pauses , and then repeats in a thick Mandarin accent , " Maaaa . . . ma . " <p> The 19-month-old girl , abandoned in central China the day she was born , stares blankly at her new mother and cries . She 's too young to understand she soon would be making her home across the ocean with two strange-looking foreigners who do n't speak a word of Chinese . <p> Within a few hours , however , the girl happily takes a bottle from her new father , Han Schiet , and clutches a Goofy doll  --  the transition to American child under way . She is now named Thea . <p> " We 're instant parents , " says Pautler , 45 . " It 's amazing how natural it is . " <p> The girl , one of 13 Chinese children adopted into families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of similar children now making homes in Chicago and the suburbs . The trip to the Far East , set up by the Sunny Ridge Family Center in Wheaton , was the seventh adoption trip arranged by Sunny Ridge in 1999 . <p> Sunny Ridge and several other Chicago area adoption clinics report arranging 920 adoptions of abandoned Chinese children in the last five years . For Illinois families , China is the most popular source of adoptees . <p> Russia sends more children to the United States ( 4,348 , compared with 4,101 from China in 1999 ) , but China sends more to Illinois  --  171 to 153 from Russia in the first 11 months of 1999 , according to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services . <p> A support group , Families with Children from China , is rapidly becoming one of the most visible organizations at the Chinese New Year parade in Chinatown each February . The group holds a variety of year-round events to acquaint parents and children with each other and Chinese culture . <p> Pat Kluzik-Stauch of Elgin , who adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter of FCC in 1995 , called the rate of growth of adoptive families " pretty amazing . " <p> " There is a pretty active adoptive community in Illinois , especially around Chicago , " she said . " For a mixed-race family , it 's pretty easy to blend in . It 's very accepting . " <p> While most adopting parents have fertility problems and find China the easiest country to work with , some prospective parents head to China for the sole purpose of helping a child in need . The group that visited China in November ranged in age from 34 to 50 and included lawyers , teachers , financial analysts , small-business owners and a former military pilot . <p> For Pautler and Schiet , who are living temporarily in Paris , and the other dozen families , the trip to China was the culmination of a sometimes-grueling process . <p> Adopting families must fill out and notarize 59 forms required by the Chinese and U.S. governments , said Bob McNeill , director of intercountry adoption at Sunny Ridge . China wants to ensure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to ensure the child wo n't become a ward of the state , he said . <p> The process includes a detailed home study , review of tax returns , letters of reference and a fingerprint check . Applicants must submit results of physical exams and negative HIV tests . <p> Depending on how long it takes a family to complete the paperwork , the process typically takes 12 to 18 months . Although China is less expensive than some countries , the cost is steep : $ 16,000 to $ 22,000 . <p> What 's more , some families battle misperceptions and racism , even within their own families . <p> Laura Garbacz , 45 , a stay-at-home mom from Schaumburg , said her parents were dismayed when she told them of her plan to adopt her first child from China in 1997 . But after fertility treatments caused her heart to stop briefly , she and her husband Robert , 48 , went ahead with the adoption . <p> " It 's been wonderful , " she said , adding that most of her friends and family have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring allowing Chinese and foreign families to adopt a second child , she went back in November . <p> Six and a half months after submitting the paperwork to the Chinese Center for Adoption Affairs in Beijing , the families received a photo of the child selected for them , attaching a face to the largely bureaucratic process . <p> Christine Casper , 48 , a former teacher from Barrington , said that in no time she " fell in love " with her child 's photo . She taped it to a button and wore it on her jacket . <p> Before the November trip to get the children , Michael Lauzon , a 38-year-old lawyer from the Northwest Side , said he could barely grasp the magnitude of what he and his wife Janet Vander Kelen were about to do . <p> " In two weeks , I will be in a world unknown to me , receiving a child that will be a part of my life for the remainder of my life , " he said . " I never imagined nor planned , until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The families first flew to Beijing , where they spent a weekend on a whirlwind tour of the Great Wall , Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square . <p> Then the group headed to Hubei , a province in central China and home to the Yangtze River . Flooding of the river left thousands of people dead and millions homeless in 1998 . It was the worst flooding since 1954 . <p> During times of floods or disaster , experts say , the numbers of abandoned children increase . While no one can say with certainty how many children are abandoned or orphaned in China , the government has said it is no more than 100,000 . But some Western experts say there are likely several hundred thousand , and the vast majority are girls . Because sons traditionally care for their elderly parents in Chinese society , and most families are only allowed one child , daughters lose out . <p> " Parents do n't want to abandon their daughters , " said Kay Johnson , an Asian studies professor at Hampshire College in Amherst who has studied abandonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to have a son , they had no choice . " <p> Most parents first see their newborn children in a hospital , but the parents from Chicago are to meet their children on the second floor of the Li Jiang Hotel in the capital of the province , Wuhan ( population 7 million ) . The hotel is also home to the Ministry of Civil Affairs , which arranges adoptions in the province . <p> To meet the needs of new parents , the Li Jiang equips most rooms with baby cribs , sells a milk-yogurt baby drink and offers a baby-sitting service . <p> The night before the scheduled adoptions , the families fill out yet another form pledging they never will abandon the children . <p> James and Ting Ting Branit , both 38 , of Beverly , said the days before the adoption reminded them of waiting for the birth of their first daughter two years ago . Born with Down syndrome , the girl soon died . <p> " It 's very similar to giving birth , " James Branit , a lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really have no idea what she looks like until we see her . We do n't know what her personality is . It 's a total unknown . " <p> The next morning , it is overcast and chilly , a typical fall day in China . But inside , emotions run high : Couples who spent many frustrating years trying to start a family realize they soon will be parents . <p> Shortly before the 8 a.m. scheduled delivery , the families race frantically about the hotel , clutching baby blankets , gifts for the orphanages and briefcases full of documents . <p> Slowly the children , between 10 months and 33 months old , arrive with their caretakers . They come from eight different orphanages from small cities throughout the province , some an overnight train trip away . Many of the children are with foster parents , signaling an increasing trend in China . <p> The children appear healthy and well-cared for , if a little frightened . Many have red dye dotted on their foreheads : the color red is considered lucky in China . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the children 's faces with the pictures they 've stared at for three months . Donna Rose , 37 , a former special education teacher from Naperville , rushes her husband , Henry , over to a small bundle of a child dressed in a blue and yellow winter outfit . <p> " I think it 's her , " she says . But they find out it 's a boy who is being adopted by Robert and Marilyn Bernard of the Northwest Side . Undaunted , the Roses continue to search for their daughter-to-be . <p> In a room with several rows of large gray easy chairs and a Chinese flag in the corner , the tense parents gather with a host of Chinese officials for the adoption ceremony . Tea is served . <p> Applause erupts after the head of the Ministry of Civil Affairs announces that the government has approved the families ' adoption applications . <p> As Patrice and Vince Klingler of Naperville go to the front of the room to meet their child , the other families sit on the edge of their seats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingerprint the adoption decree , which says the new parents must treat the child as their own and " guarantee healthy growth and good education . " <p> They must agree not to give up the child to anyone else and to allow her freedom of marriage  --  pledges that aim to dispel rumors that children adopted by foreigners are sold into slavery or marriage  --  or worse , harvested for their organs . <p> To seal the deal , the official coats the baby 's foot with ink and presses it against the back of the decree . <p> Vince Klingler gives the official a plate with an etching of the Chicago skyline , plus $ 3,000 for the orphanage . That fee goes to orphanages around the province , and experts say it has been crucial toward improving the once-dire conditions at orphanages . <p> The daughter 's foster mother hands the girl to Patrice . The Klinglers now have legal custody of their second child from China . <p> " Dreams are unfolding before our eyes , " Donna Rose remarks . <p> As the day progresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , new parents and foster parents alternate laughing and crying . <p> Outside the room , in a second-floor lobby , the new parents begin to get to know their children . Through translators , they chat with the children 's caretakers about diets , potty habits and sleep schedules . <p> The Roses ' daughter , 16-month-old Qi Chun Jie , likes rice , fish and sweets . Donna Rose 's eyes tear up as she strokes her new daughter 's hair ; she whispers , " Hi , Elizabeth , " as the girl falls asleep in her arms . <p> The adoption is bittersweet , however . Sobbing heavily , Chun Jie 's foster mother and caretaker for most of the girl 's life watches the elevator doors close as the girl leaves with her new parents . <p> " You could see she was loved and so much a part of the family , " Rose said . " You could see the Chinese love their children . " <p> A law change last April allows Chinese families to adopt even if they are n't childless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lead to more domestic adoptions . But experts predict it could be a while before more foster parents with their own children are able to adopt . <p> The goodbye also is hard for the children . Searching for her recently departed foster family , DePaul University Professor Jean Knoll 's new daughter cries continuously . While traumatic , studies show it 's important for children to learn to attach from an early age . Then it will be easier for them to attach again even if the early bond is broken . <p> " This is as bad as it gets , " the single mother tells 2-year-old Lizhen . " I do n't blame you for screaming . You lost someone precious and got someone very strange . " <p> As the day and week progresses , the babies warm to their new parents , and begin clutching them when frightened . <p> " Thirteen families are forming , " Donna Rose says . <p> The hallway on the seventh floor of the hotel turns into a playroom , with infants crawling and toddlers running its corridors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the day and night . <p> " It 's baby central , " said Sunny Ridge 's McNeill . <p> The parents spend the week in Wuhan waiting for their children 's Chinese passports before heading to the U.S. Consulate in southern China to receive travel visas . In the United States , the families will apply for citizenship for their children , a process that can take two years . <p> Throughout the rest of the trip , Chinese onlookers surround the couples , asking questions , taking pictures and referring to the newly adopted children as " lucky babies . " <p> " You are very nice , " one says to Maureen and Bruce Berkheimer of Tinley Park , who have two boys at home and adopted a girl . <p> But elderly Chinese do n't hesitate to chide the new parents if the children do n't appear to be dressed warmly enough  --  no less than three to six layers of clothing will do . And putting a child  --  even a toddler  --  in a stroller is unacceptable . In China , a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As time passes , some parents realize some of the children are n't as healthy or socially adjusted as the others . <p> The Branits rushed their daughter to the hospital when she had stomach cramps , likely due to the improved diet they were providing her . Often , because of limited resources at orphanages , babies receive little more than diluted formula and rice gruel . Their 11-month-old daughter weighs just 14 pounds . <p> " I started to feel sympathy at first , " Ting Ting Branit said . " Later , I felt good because I can help her . If she stayed at the orphanage , she would not survive . " <p> Doctors say Chinese infants are at risk for anemia , rickets , asthma , tuberculosis , lead poisoning and malnutrition . Most of the problems are corrected once the children come to the United States , where they typically have better nutrition and less exposure to pollution . <p> For children raised in an institution , just being with a family can have remarkable results . DePaul University graduate student Rebecca Nelson conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 59 percent experienced mental developmental delays and 86 percent experienced motor delays upon their arrival in the United States . Within six months , mental delays were found in only 33 percent of the children , motor delays in 54 percent . <p> " These are very resilient children , " Nelson said . <p> Christine Casper , whose daughter never had left the orphanage before traveling to Wuhan and may not have been exposed to much light , realizes her daughter will need a healthy dose of socialization . <p> The girl , now named Claire FuZhen Casper , apparently did n't have a continuous caretaker or many playmates . The parents watched as the girl played alone with nothing but an unopened bag of crackers . She had yet to smile . <p> " She does n't seem really stimulated , " Christine Casper said . " But what 's in the past does n't matter . She 's ours now . She 'll be happy . " <p> For now , though , there are other things to worry about : Although toilet trained , Claire did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . She urinated while sitting on her father 's lap . <p> Christine can only laugh at her husband Coy , a new father at age 50 . <p> " Welcome to fatherhood ! " she says .
