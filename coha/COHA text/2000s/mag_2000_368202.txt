For 30 million Moroccans , he is the best thing since couscous . " We are a country of Lilliputians , " says one of them , Brahim Boulami , a 3,000-m steeplechaser . " Hicham for us is like NASA and Boeing are for the U.S. It is good to be first in the world at something . " The Gulliver he is talking about is Hicham El Guerrouj , the man who is first in the world at one of the toughest of all human challenges : running the mile and its Olympic counterpart , the 1,500 m . <P> The Moroccans ' view of their world-record holder over both distances may be suffused with national pride , but the outstanding middle-distance athletes who have gone before El Guerrouj do n't dispute the praise . " He 's the best I 've seen by a long way , " says Sebastian Coe , now Lord Coe , who along with fellow Britons Steve Ovett and Steve Cram traded the mile record between 1979 and 1985 . Their reign fell to Africa in 1993 , when Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-year-old record . <P> Then in Rome last year El Guerrouj made that staggering run pale when he peeled the mythical mark down to 3 min. 43.13 sec. , almost 1 1/2 sec. faster than Morceli 's time . El Guerrouj would have finished roughly 110 m ahead of Roger Bannister , had the first man to break the 4-min. - mile barrier been time-transported to Rome from chilly 1954 England . <P> It 's not so much what he does to the clock that defines El Guerrouj . It is the apparent ease with which he turbines energy down through his heart , lungs and legs onto the track . Like a Menuhin or a Matisse , El Guerrouj is the consummate artist who makes the end product look as simple as a tune-up or a rough draft . That was certainly the impression he left with those of us lucky enough to see him run the 1,500 m at the world championships in Seville last year . He crossed the line slowing down to a 3:27.65 clocking , blowing kisses to the packed stadium after what Coe described as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3:32.53 seems doomed . And once again El Guerrouj had defeated the only man who can push him to change gears , the brilliant young Kenyan Noah Ngeny . <P> Another man who should know said of El Guerrouj last month , " The main thought I have about Hicham is his economy of movement , the way in which he is able to move his legs without any hint of strain or overstriding . " The expert in question is Bannister , now 71 . A meeting with him was one of the enticements for El Guerrouj to run at a meet in London . ( Yes , of course he won . He has n't been beaten over the 1,500 m or the mile since the end of 1997 . ) <P> The self-effacing young Moroccan  --  he turns 26 the day before the Games start  --  said he was honored to meet " Monsieur Bannister " and said Bannister 's 3:59.4 time on a cinder track in 1954 was the equivalent of about 3:42 today , or a meter or so ahead of his own Rome record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinder tracks turning synthetic , training has changed a little since Sir Roger 's day . While he packed his into half-hour sessions of 440-yd. repetitions , El Guerrouj reels out a total of 5 hr. a day at a high-altitude camp at Ifrane , in Morocco 's Atlas Mountains , wearing to exhaustion a series of rabbits that try to keep up with him . His coach , Abdelkader Kada , has said , " He needs a coach to tell him he is doing too much , not too little . "
