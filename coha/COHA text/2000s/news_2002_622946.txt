Through the year , an avalanche of works comes tumbling out of the high-rise ( and even dining-room ) offices of publishers , and though a tiny percentage of it might make a person think that literacy can be a curse , the majority of those books deliciously sizzle the mind . <p> What follows then are some of those books of 2002 that caught our eye and that we think are worth your time  --  histories , biographies , novels , stories , essays and more that are important , erudite , challenging , lovely or just plain cool . The titles are listed in alphabetical order , and we 've avoided assigning any sort of ranking .

In " By the Lake , " the raw , often obliquely expressed emotion of the early novels and stories appears to have been plowed under the soil as McGahern tells the story of the daily and seasonal habits of a rural lakeside community and how pain and loss are endured and happiness achieved . <p> CAN LOVE LAST ? The Fate of Romance Over Time by Stephen A. Mitchell ( Norton ; 223 pages ; $24.95 ) : A practicing psychoanalyst until his death in 2000 , a noted writer in his field and the editor of the influential journal Psychoanalytic Dialogues , Mitchell draws upon his clinical experience with patients , his knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philosophy , sociology , anthropology and history to examine the question posed in his title .

If Levi 's writings alone did not make the case , Angier 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer , not only because of his intelligence and compulsive reserve but also by being a paragon of moral seriousness .

From late Roman times , when the region is under threat from Goth and Visigoth , the novel leaps to medieval Europe during Rome 's decay , the threat of the Black Death and Avignon 's rise to glory , to occupied France during World War II , when darkness once more looms over European civilization . Pears could not have chosen a setting richer in beauty or in historical resonance , as he tells the story of three people , one from each period , with fateful political choices to make at times when no one 's hands can remain entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascinates and Infuriates the World by Mark Hertsgaard ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; 236 pages ; $23 ) : Long before Sept. 11 , 2001 , San Francisco journalist Hertsgaard had already embarked on round-the-world travels to research a book on how the United States is perceived outside its borders , interviewing people from all walks of life .

Starr parcels " Embattled Dreams " into 11 chapters , one for each year from 1940 to 1950 , using individual years as limited but useful pretexts , springboards from which to dive into the bottomless backyard pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as anyone alive . <p> EMPORIUM by Adam Johnson ( Viking ; 256 pages ; $23.95 ) : Johnson 's masterful story collection depicts a discomfortingly recognizable alternative reality with violence as its organizing force . The San Francisco native often blends the past , present and future to create a searing juxtaposition between scientific progress and its futility in the face of mortality . With pulsating energy and seemingly endless imagination , this collection pushes to its exciting limits the irony  --  observed by Johnson  --  that " there 's a freedom that comes with doom . " <p> EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED by Jonathan Safran Foer ( Houghton Mifflin ; 276 pages ; $24 ) : In his first novel , Foer interweaves separate narratives by two young men .

As Vakeel 's illness progresses , the squabbles and scheming of his children come into the foreground along with a wonderful group of eccentrics . How the family comes nearly undone before it reknits itself makes for a wonderfully wise and moving story , something like a soap opera , to be sure , but after this story you feel washed clean . <p> FEMALE TROUBLE by Antonya Nelson ( Scribner ; 256 pages ; $24 ) : Any lover of realistic narrative fiction will be greatly rewarded by Nelson 's work . She pulls no punches and airbrushes nothing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her new collection of stories , her honesty is perfect , her prose is frequently beautiful without being afraid to be coarse , and her strong , confused , wild and funny women are unforgettable and , while indeed troubled , are steel-willed and ready for anything . <p> FROM THE LAND OF GREEN GHOSTS : A Burmese Odyssey by Pascal Khoo Thwe ( HarperCollins ; 320 pages ; $24.95 ) : Khoo Thwe 's prize-winning memoir charts the author 's spellbinding journey from a tribal village in the remote mountains of Burma to the medieval halls of Caius College at Cambridge University in England .

But through it all , Slouka gracefully bestows upon Chang  --  of Chang and Eng  --  the individuality that his public life denied him . Few books in recent memory have offered as much in terms of fully formed characters , and fewer authors share Slouka 's gift of rendering the extraordinary in ordinary terms without sacrificing its potency . <p> THE GOLEMS OF GOTHAM by Thane Rosenbaum ( HarperCollins ; 367 pages ; $25.95 ) : As both fiction writer and essayist , Rosenbaum has brought formidable intelligence and fierceness of vision to exploring the lives of children of Holocaust survivors .

Stewart ( Simon &; Schuster ; 307 pages ; $24 ) : Rick Rescorla , Morgan Stanley 's vice president for security , actually sang to keep people calm as he herded them out of the World Trade Center  --  a detail that might seem unbelievable if a writer of Stewart 's ( " Blood Sport " ) caliber had not chosen to tell us Rescorla 's life story . Rescorla fought in Vietnam , even though he was a British citizen at the time , and proved himself then as a true hero and a remarkable man , long before he went back for one last sweep on Sept. 11 , 2001 , after all his company 's employees were cleared out , sacrificing his own life . <p> THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals ) and Tom Killion ( woodcuts and essays ) , with excerpts from the writings of John Muir ( Heyday ; 128 pages ; $50 ) : Adapted and expanded from Killion 's original hand-pulled edition of 129 copies , this book juxtaposes excerpts from four decades of Snyder 's backpacking journals alongside the artist 's striking color and monochrome woodcuts . Snatches of naturalist John Muir 's journals come in for the same treatment . These verbal and visual elements work together to produce in the reader a light-headedness rarely encountered at sea level . <p> IGNORANCE by Milan Kundera ( HarperCollins ; 208 pages ; $23.95 ) : In his new novel , Kundera , the 73-year-old Czech native and resident of France , casts a black light on the insidious pull of nostalgia .

O'Brien is evenhanded in her compassion for the murderer and the victims , and with her cutting prose and deft sympathy , she shows us the frailty and darkness of people and disturbs us by offering no easy resolution . <p> IN THE HAND OF DANTE by Nick Tosches ( Little , Brown ; 376 pages ; $24.95 ) : Tosches ' third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books with the same titles as those written by the author of " In the Hand of Dante , " but he 's also killed a few people and robbed a lot more and gets involved in a plot to steal a manuscript purported to be an original of Dante 's masterpiece , " The Divine Comedy .

The incestuous relationship between Byron and his older half-sister , Augusta Leigh , was soon an all-but-open secret . Crane 's gripping account of the exceedingly strange relationship that bound Lady Byron to her sister-in-law focuses on their two vastly different characters and evokes the huge effect Byron had on those involved with him and on society at large . <p> KOBA THE DREAD : Laughter and the Twenty Million by Martin Amis ( Miramax ; 306 pages ; $24.95 ) : Amis ( " Experience " ) focuses on Stalin 's reign over the Soviet Union  --  probably the most murderous in history  --  and its Bolshevik prelude .
