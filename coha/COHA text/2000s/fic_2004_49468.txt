It is as simple as this : Brotherman 's had a little problem with its local competitors , The Two Men And A Truck crew . The Two Men And A Truck crew are former cops . <p> Now Steve is standing here on the side of the road with a current cop , and his finger , a part of himself which he loathes , pokes into the meaty ball in the corner of his eye . At first he 's shocked to see the thing there and thinks it 's someone else 's . But he recognizes the sad condition of his own digit in the bright glare of the streetlight as it misses his nose completely . <p> This sad condition is a constant source of embarrassment . Just the other day , two girls , strangers in some waiting area , suggested that he get a manicure . <p> " I do n't even know you , " he said to them . <p> " They 're really bad , " one of them said , " your nails . " <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that ? " <p> " They 're disgusting , " said the other one . <p> Steve has always known they are disgusting fingers , spindly and crooked from breaking them as a kid . He ca n't recall ever having a full nail . He bites them down to nothing-a habit he 's recently been trying to break , going around with hot sauce coating them , reeking of cayenne and vinegar . They are jagged yellow scabs , protection for ten small wounds . <p> The surprise of that one appearing where it is n't supposed to and sticking him in the eye makes him lose track of the penny hidden under his tongue , and swallow it . <p> Much of the pull-over he does n't remember , only the highlights ... sliding a penny from the ashtray and dropping it on his tongue ... scratching his eyeball so bad the penny slides right down his throat ... <p> Immediately Steve begins-maybe this is n't the right wordsensing the penny in his stomach . He experiences two distinct sensations : the pressure of his palm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penny inside him , a presence . If he moves the hand , pain lights up in his eye . <p> Steve and the cop stand there a few silent minutes looking at each other on the side of the road . The cop looks at Steve , and Steve looks at the cop . He blinks his one eye . He keeps the other eye covered with his palm , pointing his fingers outward like lashes . He does n't even want to touch himself with them . Not in the eye , not on his dick . He wants to keep his fingers away from himself . <p> Steve does n't know what to do with his other arm so it hangs limp . He does not have his swerve on . <p> " So it 's like that , is it ? " the cop says . <p> " Like how ? " <p> There is no response . <p> " I think I really did something to my eye , " Steve says . " I ca n't seem to take my hand away from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the cop says . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " I 'll tell you . I think your eye 's not hurt . I think you 're trying to get out of something . " The cop believes Steve to be bullshitting . He believes him to be drunk as well . <p> " Oh , it 's hurt . It 's definitely hurt . " <p> " And I do n't suppose you could pass any more tests , then , huh ? " <p> " It 'd be difficult . I am happy to try . It 'd not be easy . Not one bit . However , I am cooperative . I will do what you ask . I am being cooperative . " <p> The cop walks Steve to the squad car . He jostles him some , testing his swerve for himself . Steve is steadfast . Never mind he missed his nose . Steve is the best drunk driver you 'll meet . He 'd been pulled not because of the seatbelt , either . No one can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is some bullshit-excuse law . He 'd been pulled for his magnetic signs , and he should have known better . <p> He 'd won them off a sign painter , in a drinking contest , and he could peel them off at any time . But they are fantastic white magnetic signs , and Steve is proud of them . They announce in the way the constant fliering at the grocery store does n't that he runs a real business . In beveled yellow letters , a yellow so fantastic you can almost call it neon , " Brotherman 's Hauling . " <p> But this is Steve 's perspective . He is actually a piss-poor drunk driver . He has been for years . <p> . . . the cop shoving him into the backseat . . . looking at him again , crouched down in front of his face , a distinct fishy scent on his breath . . . <p> " Remove your mitt from your facial area . " Steve does and brushes the cop 's cheek . " Jesus Christ , " the cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apology , " Steve says . <p> " Now open it . " <p> Steve tries , but he can only manage a tight squint . Everything is blurred , and the effort it takes to open that one forces the other one closed . <p> " How many ringers am I holding ? " the cop says . <p> " I have no idea . " Which he does not . He sees refracted light , lots of refracted light , and shapes . <p> " Well , do n't lay down back there , " the cop says . <p> " Why would I lay down ? " <p> " Some people lay down . " The cop shuts the door behind him , then climbs in the front and radios for an ambulance . With the dispatcher , he refers to Steve as " some numbnuts who seems to have poked his own eye during the drunk test . " <p> Steve instinctively gnaws on the thumbnail of his spare hand . He need not even , as he usually does , remind himself of the protein in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has a little gadget with a tube coming off it . " While we 're waiting , you do n't need either one of your eyes to blow into this . " <p> . . . blowing into the Breathalyzer . . . the readout on the Breathalyzer mercifully holding at point zero seven nine , just one one-thousandth from some jail , some losing some license , some losing some business . . . the EMTs installing a patch over the eye . . . himself driving away angry and horny and extremely hungry for Taco Bell . . . <p> Brotherman 's Hauling 's little problem was-you know , there 'd been no problem when the Two Men stuck to moving . But maybe the moving business was n't too hot or something . Just last week they stumbled across a flier at the Price Chopper that read , " Two Men And A Truck : Moving , AND NOW HAULING TOO . " Technically , yes , movers and haulers both haul things . They also both move them . But to Steve 's mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about are moved . Things that people do n't want or care about are hauled . <p> In some towns the Two Men And A Truck company is a franchise , the kind of place that hires buff frat boys and deducts FICA . This Two Men And A Truck is just that , two men and a pickup , just like Steve and Jeremy , the F-150 , and Brotherman 's Hauling . Steve and Jeremy might even have welcomed their expansion , a little competition , had those fuckers not tacked their fliers up directly over the Brotherman 's fliers . <p> Exactly one week before the pull-over , Steve took one of the tear-off phone numbers from the Two Men flier . He then called with a fake hauling job . " It 's a little drive out of town , " he said . " But the payoff is worth it . " <p> " We have a few moving gigs scheduled , " one of the Two Men said . " If it 's that big we can cancel them . " <p> Steve described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point-by-point description of the first hauling job Brotherman 's had ever done , transporting five hundred fifty-five-gallon drums , the kind bums make fires in , to the barrel refurbishing plant . The plant 's drivers had gone on a strike . It had required precision stacking , four-inch truck cargo straps , and multiple trips to haul it all in the F-150 . But it had paid extremely well . That one job funded the whole business . It bought Brotherman 's computer and the mobile . Steve described the job to the one man , who sounded very eager . Steve gave him a fake address of a drum processing facility on the Old Highway . He gave him a fake phone number , too . <p> So when the mobile buzzed later that evening , he did n't think anything much of it . Steve 's plans have simple flaws . It was actually the two men of Two Men on at the same time . <p> " You cost us a day , pussboy , " said one of them , Steve thought the same one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the other one . <p> " That 's brotherman to you , " Steve said . " You have conference call or something ? How do you get that ? " <p> " Yeah , we got conference call , " said the first one . " And you got a genuine problem . " <p> " What are they saying ? " Jeremy said . <p> " They say we 've got a problem , " Steve said . <p> " Talking to your pussy , dick ? " one of the two men said . Steve could n't tell them apart anymore . <p> " They ask if I 'm talking to my pussy , " Steve said . <p> " Tell them your pussy takes umbrage at their comment , " Jeremy said . <p> " Takes what ? " <p> " You guys need to watch your backs . This ai n't cool . We let you run your little show around here long enough . Now there may be some action . " <p> " An equal and opposite reaction ? " Steve said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Um-bridge , " Jeremy said . <p> " Payback action , " the two men said . <p> " My pussy takes umbrage at your comment , " Steve said . <p> " Umbrage to your comment , " one of them said , and they hung up . <p> Steve regretted making the phony call . <p> " Well ? " Jeremy said . <p> " They corrected you . " <p> " Corrected what ? " <p> " They said it 's umbrage to your comment . " <p> " Bullshit , " Jeremy said . " Bullfuckingshit . " <p> Steve is hyperaware of his shit as it moves through him . He searches the bowl . He probes with a wire coat hanger , but there 's no penny . He feels it still , somewhere within him , a point of pressure there above his stomach , a little insignificant weight . <p> He removes two bowls of hot sauce from the fridge and soaks his fingers for ten minutes like he 's seen women in manicure shops soaking their fingers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tips turn a crusty orange . They sting and tighten . <p> Because the floors in Steve 's apartment are paper-thin , the Red-haired Girl downstairs can hear him masturbating at his computer . Except today he 's as silent as possible . He uses a polyethylene glove coated in cocoa butter on his right hand and runs the mouse with his left . <p> He knows she can hear him because yesterday , before he started drinking , the Red-haired Girl had a little talk with him , during which he pretty much got the picture . She knocked on his door while he had the news on . She told him the news was too loud . <p> " It 's the news , " he said . " How can the news be loud ? " <p> " I can hear everything that goes on up here , " she said . " Everything . " This being her subtle hint that he might want to check the volume at which he engages Internet porn . He understood that she issued her complaint intentionally during an innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was not in the middle of the activity she really wanted to put a stop to . She was smart , he figured . Of course he knew how troubling it was to be able to hear something like that . He could hear the guy above him jerking off to Internet porn , too . Some faggot fucks might find the guy above you jerking off at the same time as you exciting . It really bugs Steve , though . And because he can never hear the Red-haired Girl downstairs doing anything , he knows the guy upstairs can not hear him . Sound moves downward , he thinks . <p> So when he breaks for attempting to expel the penny again , he hears the guy upstairs watching The Price Is Right at a normal volume-normal in this building means , in the quiet of his apartment one floor removed , he hears the sound of Bob Barker 's voice over his own bathroom fan . <p> Steve goes upstairs and knocks on the door . He keeps his hands in his pockets . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why the eye patch ? " They have never spoken before . <p> " Work injury , " Steve says . <p> " Workman 's comp . That 's my secret . " He grabs his thigh and says , " Oh my leg ! " He hops around in his foyer . " If you know what I mean . " <p> Steve delivers the exact same lines the Red-haired Girl used on him , and the guy upstairs responds at first pretty much as he had . <p> " Loudness is a subjective thing , " the guy says . <p> " I can hear everything that goes on up here , " Steve says . " Everything . " He tries to approximate the Red-haired Girl 's expression . And he thinks the guy upstairs gets it , just as he had gotten it . Unlike Steve , though , he pushes . <p> " Give me an example ? " the guy says . <p> " Oh , I can , you know , just about everything . You walking around . Opening the refrigerator , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like what ? What was I watching at two a.m. this morning ? " <p> " I do n't actually log , " Steve says . <p> " Sure you 're not just an asshole ? " the guy asks-sincerely , Steve thinks . <p> " No , look , it 's just that these apartments suck . I can hear everything , all right . " <p> " To travel , sound requires a medium of transmission . For instance , solid , liquid , or air . I suppose I could convert my apartment into a vacuum of space . There is no sound in a vacuum of space , " the guy says . <p> Steve goes back downstairs . In a little while , just as Steve is thinking about quietly jerking off again , the guy upstairs starts in . He clearly is n't trying to hold it down any . Steve can hear him talking to the monitor . Steve blushes , picturing the Red-haired Girl hearing him saying very similar things . <p> Instead Steve sends out e-mails to old clients , offering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When You Need a Haul : Brothermans , he writes at the end of each . Most of them come back asking to please have their addresses purged from this list . Many simply write , Remove . The guy upstairs orgasms . He goes off like a bear . There is brief silence , then Bob Barker 's muffled voice fills the room . <p> Steve eats a Pepcid and goes outside to walk around the apartment complex with his hands behind his head to try and get rid of the cramp coming on in his gut . The bad thing about the Redhaired Girl is that she has a dog , an ugly little English bulldog named Lusya . She walks it constantly with all the other women in the complex who have dogs . She 's told them about Steve . He imagines her telling them about him going at it up there , three to four solid hours . Every woman with a dog in the complex avoids him . When he walks past them in the halls , they look at the floor and allow their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close enough to feel their hot breath on his marinated fingers . <p> The Red-haired Girl , however , being complicated , does talk to him . She has this nice thing . She wanted to let him know that she could hear what he was doing by telling him she could hear him doing something else , in order to get him to stop doing what he was doing so loudly , but in a way so he thought she really did n't hear what he was doing , because that kind of embarrassed her . And when she sees him with the patch over his eye , she feigns concern . He does n't know her name , and she does n't know his . <p> He keeps his hands behind his head-women notice hands-and tells her that he scratched the cornea at work . It 's funny , he thinks , the loss of an eye does n't really even bother him ; the addition of a penny does . When they talk , while it is obvious she is trying to be nice , she maintains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this with everyone . Lusya donates a half-hearted jump at his leg . Even her dog pretends to like him . <p> Evolutionarily speaking , Steve considers himself a fluke . He is short , not tall . Like his fingernails , his toenails are bad , though he has never bitten them . He is not particularly smart ; is weird-looking ; and no good at sports or fighting . He compulsively has bad idea after bad idea , such as starting this hauling company now dying a brisk death . There 's not much propulsion behind his orgasm . <p> " You were right , you know , " he says . " These apartments really do suck . I mean . I do n't know if I should tell you this . But the guy upstairs from me . . . " Steve motions for her to come nearer . " I do n't know if I should tell you this . " <p> " Yeah , " she says , and steps backward . <p> " He masturbates all day , " Steve says , resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " For hours and hours . It 's so loud . " <p> " Are you kidding me ? " she says . <p> " No . It 's terrible , like he 's in the same room with me , which you have to admit if you 've ever seen him , it 's a scary thought . But I do n't want to go up there and tell him I can hear that , you know . " <p> " Yeah , it 's awkward , or something . " <p> " You 're telling me . I would n't be a bit surprised if you could hear him straight through to your apartment . " <p> " Hours and hours and hours ? " she says . <p> " At least . And talking to the screen . Oh baby , oh yeah baby . It 's enough to , I tell you . Freaking pathetic . I 've heard him-and you know he 's the only one up there-going Rock with me . Rock with me . Suckle , suckle . . . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about embarrassing . I thought that was you . " Her skin turns the exact shade of her hair and freckles , causing her freckles to temporarily disappear . <p> " Oh , no . No ! You should-you can come up sometime and listen . I mean just to prove it . " <p> She immediately gets all apologetic . Her skin color deepens and deepens until it begins to brown . The shade of her skin overtakes the freckles , and they resurface . She checks him out , seems to see him in a new light . She leans in , as if they 're chuckling a secret . The dog rubs its butt against his boot . <p> " Do you smell hot sauce ? " she asks . <p> There is an immediate , marked transformation in the way women with dogs around the complex relate to Steve . When he leaves that afternoon to pick up Jeremy , a blonde with a Newfoundland the size of a Yugo , a dog which she 'd just yesterday allowed to plant both its front paws on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and when the Yugo goes for his hands , she jerks it back . " He 's nothing , " she says , " an absolute vagina monologue . " <p> So Steve is as upbeat as a guy with a foreign body in him can be until they cruise around town checking their fliers . They discover all of them-at the gas stations , the COTA stops , the dump , the post office , fish camp , the industrial parks , in the Port-O-Lets at construction sites , Skyline Chili , Payless Shoes , the comic book store-covered up with Two Men And A Truck fliers . They append their fliers with super sticky double-sided tape , which ruins the Brotherman 's fliers underneath . <p> " The miracle is we still have enough pennies to Xerox our own fliers , " Jeremy says when they check the Community Bulletin Board at the Price Chopper , " with you going around eating them all . " Jeremy scribbles on the Two Men fliers . On one he draws a little caricature of two stick-figure men buttfucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT your two frigging faces . I take umbrage AT your hauling . I take umbrage TO the Two Fags And A Buckity-Buck . <p> " You 're not getting what I 'm saying , " Steve says . " It worked . I should have blown that breath reader off the charts . All the tequila I put back . It could have been fifty percent , I 'm telling you . " <p> " With your drunk-driving ability , then , it had to have been the signs . Just take off the signs . " Jeremy knows what a terrible drunk driver Steve is , but , knowing what pride Steve takes in his supposed prowess , he keeps it quiet and never goes out for the serious drinking with him after work . The truth is , Jeremy has been talking to some guys at the dump who haul things around the landfill about bringing him on . There is no shortage of things people do n't want at the dump like there seems to be in the rest of the world . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems pretty obvious . I 'm saying the penny fucked up the test . " <p> Jeremy staples the new Brotherman 's fliers over the defaced Two Men fliers . <p> " I do n't know anything about a Breathalyzer , brotherman . Or for that matter what a penny will do about it . What I know is if you 'd blown one one-thousandth more , there 'd be no business right about now . Then what would we do ? " Jeremy would step up the pressure on the guys at the dump , is what . Jeremy ca n't drive , but can the bitch haul . The guy is built like a small forklift . When not carrying anything he moves about as if he 's falling backwards . He slants at forty-five degrees from knees to waist so that his feet always arrive somewhere long before the rest of him . He 's five foot four with arms that bear hug a BarcaLounger . When he picks something up , he sinks into himself ; it 's the only time his feet and head are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fight . Jeremy can haul . Jeremy likely intimidates . Jeremy can not fight . <p> " If one single person on one single night sees these signs , and we get a job out of it , that 's one single job we 'd have . I 'm not taking off the signs . I 'd just like to pass this penny . " <p> " It will pass , " Jeremy says . " Have faith in that much . " <p> Steve does n't know . <p> Once they replace their fliers , they do what they usually do : They buy a six-pack of Hollandia tall boys and go drink them at the park with their feet propped on the sideview mirrors . The end of Brotherman 's may be near , anyway . Jeremy hands Steve his hot sauce from the glove compartment , and he unloads into his beer . He drinks the beer in hopes it will make him feel normal . <p> They wait for the mobile to ring . Jeremy searches phrase books and novels and newspapers from the library for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does pull-ups on the jungle gym . Steve worries about the penny and tries not to chew his nails . He rubs under his rib cage to see if he can feel anything and stains his T-shirt orange . <p> " You 're worth more now , " Jeremy says . " Think of it like that . Steve plus one cent . " Then Jeremy says , " Tomorrow , let 's go in early and ambush the Two Men at Price Chopper . " Steve understands this to mean they will be kicking some Two Men ass in retribution for having one of their cop buddies pull him over , but Jeremy intends only to clarify a grammatical point . <p> " What time ? " Steve says . <p> " Early , make sure we do n't miss them , " he says . <p> " Sixish , then ? " <p> " Sixish . " <p> Steve purchases sample packs of Metamucil and Ex-Lax and a single packet of apple and cinnamon oatmeal from the Dollar Store on the way home . That night he panics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with him medically but does not have insurance . His jowls quiver . He 's sweaty and pale in the bathroom mirror , white as the gauze eye patch . He washes his hands , and he wants to bite them so bad , they tremble . He rushes into the kitchen and soaks them again in the two bowls of hot sauce , beating his head on the table to the Jeopardy tune . He mixes fiber , oatmeal , and laxative in a bowl of boiling water . He breathes the steam , and when it 's cool enough , he eats . <p> Afterward , he powers on the computer and takes out his polyethylene glove , coats it in cocoa butter , goes to one of the free movie sites , and cranks up . He talks to the screen , imitating the voice of the guy upstairs , and when it 's over he collapses into the lawn chair he uses as an office chair , then spends an hour on the toilet pushing , concentrating , pushing , before admitting failure , swallowing half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on what Steve told her , the Red-haired Girl hears Steve as she prepares for bed and watches the Weather Channel , slightly concerned by the TV 's constant beeping because of severe incoming weather . She believes that it is the guy two floors up jerking off while talking to the screen , even though the sound seems to be coming from directly over her head . The walls and ceilings are thin enough , she believes , which is why the severe incoming weather concerns her . <p> Steve wakes to weather sirens and the taste of fingers . In his sleep , the fingers of his left hand-his favorite to chew for reasons having to do with angle and bent-have migrated to his mouth . Outside it sounds like a bombing raid . He opens his window , and the wind and rain whip through the room . The sirens are interspersed with a garbled message . he sticks his head out into the dark to hear better . Weather-warning megaphone speakers in the distance blare something that sounds like : Lorena Babbitt in area . Seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . It 's the Red-haired Girl , standing there holding a vanilla-scented candle . <p> " This is your wake-up call , " she says . " The severe incoming weather is income . The whole building 's in the basement . " <p> Steve disappears to find his shoes . He slips his bare feet into his work boots . When he comes back , she is standing in his living room . In the lightning flashes , he sees the hot sauce bowls on the kitchen table , the open tub of cocoa butter , and the glove on the computer desk . <p> " We have the exact same space , " she says . " And there is where the magic happens . " She points to the ceiling . <p> He makes to get her out of the room fast , taking her by the waist . She interprets this as a forward move . She likes forward . They take the steps carefully in the dark , stopping only to let the guy upstairs brush by with a flashlight , his feet smacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement first . Her candle illuminates their neighbors and a gold mine of junk . Steve simply marvels for a moment . The remnants of who knows how many years of tenants ' leftovers , rotten and mildewed from the moisture , well beyond any desirable condition . The mess is arranged in aisles . Their neighbors are situated among the aisles in little cliques . The women with dogs smile nervously and wave . Every person secretly chastises himself for saving the however-much per month to live in the flimsy-walled apartment building they all live in . An AM radio reports multiple tornadoes spotted in the area . <p> Steve takes the candle and the lead now . He wanders through lanes of wooden crates , old doors , paintings , battered suitcases , porch swings , mattresses , and box springs . There 's ancient dressers and stacks of mismatched drawers , a foreign-looking trunk , and couch beds-big , heavy , steel couch beds . <p> The Red-haired Girl takes Steve 's arm . Her nails dig into his bicep . He registers their crispy quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see them reflecting the candle , finely shaped , perfectly manicured , the kind with a whitewall across the top and a lavender body . The Xanax emphasizes everything . <p> The Red-haired Girl stops him in front of a basement window . She points to a blanket underneath two sawhorses , where her bulldog , Lusya , is sitting . " Kind of a cool spot , right ? " she says . <p> " A room with a view , " Steve says . Through the window they see the little shrubs lining the apartment building sideways in the wind . <p> The siren and the unintelligible announcement broken-records . <p> " What the hell are they trying to tell us ? " Steve asks . <p> " The sky is plummeting , " she says . <p> " I do n't know your name , " Steve says . <p> " You see me all the time , " she says . " You must have some way of thinking of me . " <p> " The Red-haired Girl , " Steve says . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's stick with those for now . " Then she says , " Look . " The little sideways shrubs are gone . <p> When he wakes up , he is horrified to discover his hand clawing up the Red-haired Girl 's stockinged leg , catching and running as it goes . A purple light seeps in through the window , and the basement is quiet . <p> She interprets his gesture in a particular way and pulls herself out of the shredded stockings . <p> " Touch me , " she says . Steve retracts his hands out of habit . <p> " I do n't do that , " Steve says . She interprets this in a particular way also . Steve is really shy and awkward about these things . She interprets him as forceful and direct . <p> She says something else then , which Steve can not decipher : " Moose me , " maybe . <p> Steve does what he believes is expected of him . He is intrigued to discover she tastes like lemon . Leaned against the foreign trunk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in his life quietly , without even a whisper , as he watches them through the sawhorses . <p> Soon Steve desires different textures . He bites , which seems to be the thing . Her body flops around . He keeps on biting , all the way down her leg , her ankle for a while , back up , knee , hip bone , nipple one , nipple two , lip , ear , lymph node , neck fold . She goes for it . When he moves down her arm-shoulder , elbow , wrist-something tells him just to get what it is he 's after . He starts small , the hard , tender nail on the end of her pinky . He nips that off in two clean bites , no tearing , practiced . Then goes the thumb . He decimates her lovely nails , during which she orgasms thrice . <p> The Red-haired Girl , while genuinely liking this , does not , however , expect that it will constitute the main activity of a sexual relationship with Steve . The guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Steve would say that he notices the penny less today . But no one is asking . Jeremy is writing on a piece of paper as Steve maneuvers the F-150 through the daybreak , around fallen power lines and trees , to the Price Chopper . He parks at the other end of the parking lot , away from the automatic doors , where they have a clear view of the Community Bulletin Board . <p> Six-thirty rolls around and then seven . Steve gets on the mobile and calls the landlord . He explains to him that he just happened to seek shelter in the basement last night and could n't help noticing all the junk . He also just happens to run a hauling company , if he 's interested in getting rid of it . The landlord seems receptive , asks for the name of his business . There is a negotiating period . Steve wants two months ' rent . The landlord says he 'll meet him there to discuss it further this week , but right now , he could actually use Brotherman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his properties . Steve says he thinks they could find time in their schedules to do that today . <p> " We got work , " he says , turning to Jeremy . Jeremy is too nervous to answer . <p> A truck parks in the fire lane . <p> Steve and Jeremy look at each other . They get out . The Two Men-caught taping over their fliers-notice them from across the parking lot . They recognize the duo from having themselves once staked out the competition for the same purpose they are now being staked out . When they 'd seen Jeremy , they 'd called that plan off . Now they come toward them , full stride . <p> And this is when Jeremy stops . Steve stops , too , figuring that Jeremy is bearing the brunt of this thing . <p> Jeremy holds up the piece of paper he 's been working on and clears his throat . The Two Men eye them from across the parking lot like in an old Western . Jeremy begins to read : <p> " Mr. Jack Maldon shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed ; and with an air of languid patronage , at which I secretly took great umbrage . . . A wife . . . who properly conducted her economy , should take no umbrage at such little fancies of her husband , but be always certain that he would return . . . " <p> Steve ignores what he thinks he mistakenly perceives as a tremble in Jeremy ' s voice . He is not mistaken . <p> " How fathers should not draw too ready rein/Nor sons take umbrage in a trice/At father 's counsels . . . " <p> Steve recognizes fully the miscalculation made here when the Two Men recommence their approach , and the sound of footsteps in hasty retreat appears first from beside him , where Jeremy was just a moment ago standing , reciting his speech , then from farther and farther behind him . On his stocky legs , Jeremy trucks through the parking lot . Whereas normally he is slanted backward , he is now full-frontal . He moves well through the morning . Steve wonders where exactly he plans to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow . <p> The Two Men stand in front of Steve looking for an answer . <p> " There 's so many things you can do with a truck , " he offers . <p> Just one of the Two Men , the one who looks like he used to be a cop , takes his shot , which Steve manages to block , but then the other hand comes as if out of nowhere because the eye patch makes for this huge blind spot . Steve stays where he falls on the wet asphalt . His teeth feel pushed . His mouth , drowned in blood , tastes of penny . <p> The Two Men look down on him as the grocery store cop waltzes over . <p> " This poor guy 's keeling here , " says one of the Two Men . <p> " Must 've just fell , " one of them said . <p> " Must 've , " says the other . <p> They both high-five the cop . <p> . . . he dreams about the Red-haired Girl 's fingernails . In the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . . . to gauge he puts his own thumb in his mouth and pushes around on his teeth . They are all there , but the front ones give , roughly as much play as the steering wheel on the F-150 . . . the cop returns with a fat man dressed in grocery store manager clothes . They look down at him . " Might be he 's a vagrant , " the cop says . " Hey , " the manager says . " You speak English ? No loitering . " <p> For a little while Steve has a scratched cornea , a penny impacted in his esophagus , and a mild concussion all at the same time . Not to mention loose teeth . A nurse has coated his fingernails in iodine , interpreting them as injuries based on their assumption that he 's homeless . Then he 's in the radiology suite , and the doctor is cramming a balloon down his throat ( fluoroscopic balloon catheter extraction ) , then inflating the balloon ( which is like taking a deep breath without taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . <p> They put him in a bed next to a kid who has swallowed a small light bulb . They apparently group like injuries together in emergency rooms . They want to keep him there for a couple hours , and since no one has brought up the whole insurance thing yet , he does n't talk too much . If they figure he 's a charity case , let them figure he 's a charity case . The kid keeps hogging the bathroom in their area to vomit . And after one trip he emerges smiling and holding a little unbroken bulb between his thumb and index finger . <p> When Steve takes his turn , he has what he would consider to be your standard , normal bowel movement . There is no plink , nor any feeling like you might expect with a penny coming out of your ass . He does not even think he 's expelled it , but he checks anyway , and there it is , submerged in the bottom of the pot . It seems larger and shinier than he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shiny . <p> He uses the back end of the toilet scrubber to slide it up the porcelain . Once he gets it near the rim , he reaches in and peels it off . He washes the penny and his hands under the cool water from the hospital sink . He dries off with the thick brown paper towels and holds the penny up to the fluorescent light . <p> In that light Steve catches sight of his fingernails . Underneath the hot sauce and iodine , they are beginning to grow over , maybe for the first time , with small but definite frosty white tips , still jagged but smoothing . The trajectory is clear . They will grow up and through the inflamed pink cuticle . They will have to . There is nowhere else to go . This will be painful , but the final result is something that Steve wants to admire . He wants to see that . For the time being at least , he thinks , I am holding in my hands eleven accomplishments . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
