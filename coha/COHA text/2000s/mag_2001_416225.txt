Biking Australia 's vast wilderness to put the Aborigines online . // It is past midnight deep in Australia 's central desert . Battery powered halogen lamps create a bubble of light where nine scientists and explorers , glistening with sweat , sit huddled around a cigarette pack-size IV monitor , peering into a digital camera . Behind the camera , ankle deep in snake intested bush , satellite technologist Jerome Thelia pushes a button and starts the cyberwhine of connected computers . Simultaneously , 16 time zones and 10,000 miles away , this faraway scene composes itself on a large screen in front of teacher Don Tester 's 19 thirdgraders in Boone , Iowa . They sit in an ICN ( Iowa Communication Network ) room , a classroom outfitted with microphones , video cameras , computers and a connection to the world 's largest full-motion video network . The children begin watching " Live From AustraliaQuest " along with 52 other classes around the country . For an hour , the students interact with the team of explorers via live video , asking questions and offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration has worked the same way : A group of people go to some distant part of the world , endure hardships , make discoveries and come back to tell us what they found . We can read their articles and books , watch their television documentaries and , in some cases , follow their progress on the Internet . No matter the medium , we end up the consumers of someone else 's experiences . AustraliaQuest uses cutting-edge technology to turn the classic model on its head : Instead of following the expedition , students help lead the expedition . Produced by Classroom Connect Inc. , in partnership with the American Museum of Natural History and Heartland Area Education Agency , AustraliaQuest will work like this : An online audience will follow and direct a team of explorers , scientists and Internet producers as they travel from Australia 's southern coast to its geographic center . The expedition 's mission is to explore Australia 's flora and fauna , geography and aboriginal culture and then share that knowledge through an Internet-delivered educational project that serves thousands of classrooms in 122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , from a time when Australia was part of a larger landmass in Southeast Asia , and through the ice age of 10,000 years ago , when Australia 's interior warmed and developed into a desert , dubbed the Outback . Working together with its young online collaborators , the AustraliaQuest expedition team 's goal is to learn how the early Aborigines adapted to the desert environment , as well as study 4 their society and the technological advancements they have made . The AustraliaQuest team includes MITtrained biologist Sherri Hitz , writer Stephanie Gregory , Harvard  --  trained anthropologist Dr. John Fox , videographer Tom Adair , producer Deborah Hardt , technologist Nick Buettner and myself , serving as expedition leader . ( By the end of the trek , more than 12 million people will have logged on to the The Quest Channel Web **30;2263;TOOLONG read the team 's updates and see photos and videos . ) Trek To The Core From the starting point on Australia 's southern coast , our team travels by four-wheel drive and mountain bikes toward Uluru ( Ayers Rock ) at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life is best preserved . The road scrapes through 990 miles of Outback , most of it desolate , red-tinted terrain reminiscent of Pathfinder images of Mars . Many of the world 's most dangerous spiders ( such as the deadly " red back " ) and snakes ( including the highly aggressive " mulga " ) live here . Temperatures routinely top 100 and the sun is intense enough to give Australia the dubious distinction of having the highest incidence of skin cancer . Photograph Photograph // Our route unfolds at the command of our online audience-approximately 45,000 students charged with making the best use of the expedition 's time and resources . They determine our route each week by using a feature on the Web site called " Set the Course . " Here , students choose one of three destinations offered by the team . The students also help us make ethical decisions , such as whether we should take photos that the Aborigines might object to . Photograph An Aborigine in ceremonial dress of red ocher and emu fat contrasts with children who 'd rather trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campfire to network the day 's activities over the Internet Uluru ( top ) and other glimpses of the Outback . // A feature called " Make a Discovery " harnesses the children 's intuitive and research powers . It 's like an enormous virtual " brain " that links minds rather than neurons . Online experts recruited from fields of study related to this project pose questions and invite input from students . Written reports , illustrated with photographs , offer daily team updates . This , coupled with a 160page study guide , gives teachers an Internet-delivered alternative to textbooks . As teacher Anne Cook , from Lyons Elementary School in Lyons , N.Y. , put it , " The Quest allows students to use reallife situations from which to learn-it allows students to learn across the curriculum rather than in bits and pieces , again making learning more relevant . " Outback Adventures The team explores the Outback by day and then updates the Quest Web site at night , often sitting cross-legged and bent over computers around a campfire . We 've prepared , or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of maps and one of the best Aussie guides money can buy in John Spencer . But , our state-of-theart equipment and thorough preparation , as it turns out , does not save us from some major challenges on the road . In the third week of our six-week journey we develop a cocky confidence that comes with having survived much of the worst of the Outback , from excruciatingly hot days on rugged roads and overgrown paths , to nights when the fear of snakes and spiders prevents us from getting any sleep . Then , despite the GPS and Spencer 's guidance , we get lost in the central desert 's Finke River Gorge when bad directions and the lack of a decent map of the area nearly capsize our expedition . As we begin crossing the Flinders Range , we immediately run into trouble . Crew members suffer cramped leg muscles , heat stroke and dried and cracked lips from the desert sun . At the gorge-a 350 million-year-old riverbed that winds its way through jagged bluffs and purple hills of central Australia-Spencer tells us that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before taking a graded road snaking off to the right . Then it 's an easy bike ride to the aboriginal village of Ipurna , where we 'll find dinner and a shower . Foolishly , we believe him . We fail to obey the most fundamental law of the wilderness , the first rule that even the greenest Boy Scout knows : Be prepared . Our first challenge , crossing the river , proves disastrous , as our feet sink in the mucky bottom as we carry our bikes above our heads . By the time we reach the other side , half of the group is on a high road into the bush and the other half pushes forward along the river 's edge where boulders and sand leave us cursing this socalled " path . " Then , oddly enough for an and region , it rains-and rains and rains . Finally we break for lunch : a ration of two sandwiches and an orange . Unsure of the direction to take next , two of us strike off in opposite routes to scout various tracks , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snarly bushes ripping bloody grooves into our bare legs . Around midafternoon we meet up with the rest of the team in a riverbed . We rejoice , each thinking that the other group knows the way . " I was having visions of how we 'd all be sleeping in the dust tonight , " one team member jokes . Everyone laughs before we realize that no one knows the way and we are miles from our support vehicles and the nearest village . After scouting out several different tracks to no avail , we call it a day and set up camp with one sandwich , three oranges , four PowerBars and an apple-for nine people . We eat the meager rations the next morning and check our maps one more time . Along with Spencer 's help and suggestions from the team , we arrive the next day in Ipurna-a motley crew that is parched , sun-blistered and filthy . Our mosquito-bitten legs have been scarred by prickly bushes . The End Is Near Our expedition continues on until we finally reach Uluru , Australia 's most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon . Big and round and brown in the midday sun , it is an unlikely feature in this otherwise flat landscape . Over 2 miles long and nearly a quarter-mile tall , it 's one of those rare natural wonders that make you cock back your head and drop your jaw . We 've come to this icon of aboriginal Australia to meet Cassidy Uluru , a tribal elder with a skill for taking people into the wilds of the Outback and teaching them how to live off the land . He leads us down a difficult path , stopping in a succession of clearings to show us various aboriginal tools and techniques . First he demonstrates for us how to make one of nature 's most powerful adhesives from Minyura tree sap , a sort of primitive " super glue . " Next , he makes a stick-and-stone weapon that could be used to kill and gut a kangaroo . Then , he shows us a weapon that a spear thrower could fling 100 ft. with lethal accuracy . This weapon , which represents one of the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear that can reach speeds in excess of 100 mph . Cassidy also carries two boomerangs , each serving as a weapon and as a kind of percussion instrument . The Aborigines invented the boomerang at least 14,000 years ago . Big deal , you might say . You tossed them as a kid . But Ray C. Nelson , from the School of Civil Engineering at the Australian Defense Academy , has studied the aboriginal version and discovered how parallel grooves along the blade 's upper side reduce drag force and increase lift  --  much the same way dimples on golf balls greatly reduce drag forces resisting flight . Our six-week odyssey ends in Uluru , but the potential for new forms of interactive exploration has just begun . Through our Web transmissions , 45,000 students have actively participated in our trek through 990 miles of some of the harshest , and most staggeringly beautiful , terrain on Earth . And , using modern technology , we 've brought some of the wonders of an ancient culture to a global classroom .
