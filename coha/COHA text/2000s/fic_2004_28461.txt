Chapter One Dear Aunt Millie : Our only son has married a lovely young woman with two small children . While we adore our new daughter-in-law , she does n't believe in disciplining her children . During their last visit , her children flooded our bathroom , spewed four-letter words , scribbled on our walls with indelible marker , started a fire in the basement because they were smoking - they 're eight and nine ! - and bit our little Sheltie puppy . And this was just the first day ! My son has just announced he and his wife are planning a three-week visit this summer , and I 'm at my wit 's end . We love our son and his family and do n't want them to feel unwelcome , but I 'm not certain my husband and I can survive three long weeks with these children . What should we do ? Frantic in Philly Dear Frantic in Philly : A hotel room is a lot cheaper than a hospital room , which is where you and your husband are headed if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family they are more than welcome to visit . Then make a reservation for them at a nearby hotel ! Best of luck , Aunt Millie Kneeling in her garden , in a patch of warm , late-August afternoon sunlight , Maggy Gallagher did n't bother to glance up when she heard the backyard gate squeak open then squeak shut again . But the heavy footsteps did cause her pause . Neighbors in this close-knit Chicago neighborhood were always cutting through her backyard to see either her grandfather or one of the other elderly residents who lived in the apartments above her grandfather 's deli . But her ears perked up when she heard footsteps heading toward her . Yet she continued repotting her oregano plant , letting the cool , rich dirt slide between her fingers , humming softly until the toes of a pair of elegant black imported Italian loafers came into her line of vision . She frowned at the toes of those shoes , a bit taken aback . Those shoes probably cost more than the entire contents of her spartan wardrobe , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this neighborhood . This was a hard-hat and dusty work boots kind of neighborhood . A typical working man 's neighborhood . " Mary Margaret Gallagher ? " The voice that belonged to the incredibly elegant shoes was very deep , cultured , educated and ... annoying . He sounded as if he was attending some formal afternoon tea instead of standing in the sweltering heat in her backyard . Definitely Ivy League , she thought , immediately feeling self-conscious and defensive and not really knowing why . It was the kind of voice that made you want to sit up straighter , stand taller and pray you did n't have anything trailing off the heel of your shoe . " Maggy , " she corrected . From this angle , the sun was right in her eyes , so she could n't see very much of him . Except that he was tall . His long legs , encased in the bottom half of a very elegant , probably custom-made gray pinstripe suit , were definitely out of place in this neighborhood . The only person who ever wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . " But you are Mary Margaret Gallagher ? " he persisted , sounding a tad annoyed . " Only to my family , " she admitted , shading her eyes and tipping her head back a bit to try to get a better look at him . " Your brother told me where to find you . " With a weary sigh , Maggy stuck her potting shovel into the dirt . " Which one ? " He frowned down at her . " Excuse me ? " " I have six brothers , " Maggy explained . " Which one sent you ? " " Collin . " He , too , blinked against the blazing sun . " Collin , " she acknowledged with a rueful shake of her head . " Some brothers send flowers , " she muttered . " My brother sends me freeloaders . " " Excuse me ? " The deep voice became even more annoyed . " Nothing . " Maggy sighed . Like all of her brothers , Collin had both a very soft heart and a very short memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse anyone anything , especially if they needed help or had a problem . Last year , after Collin , a fireman , had extinguished a small fire in the neighborhood vet 's office , Maggy had come home from work to find the vet and his entire menagerie waiting for her . She had to admit , their apartment had been more than a bit cramped with an ark full of animals , as well as herself , her grandfather and the vet all inhabiting it together for two days . Her brothers were notorious for sending her trouble . They thought because they came to her with their problems then she could handle everyone else 's problems as well . And with three of her brothers Chicago cops , and the other three Chicago firemen , there was no end to the amount of trouble they encountered on any given day . But Maggy figured it was probably just habit . As the oldest child , after her mother 's death from cancer when Maggy had been almost twelve , not that long after their police officer father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to become the female head of the household , and that included riding roughshod over her six younger brothers who had ranged in age from five through eleven , including the six-year-old twins . Over the years , her brothers had come to depend on her for help and advice - especially when they were in trouble . ( Continues ... )
