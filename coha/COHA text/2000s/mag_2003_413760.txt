See also additional image in Table of Contents of same issue I have always enjoyed reading about science , but I 'm going to give up discussing the subject with my so-called friends . For one thing , it can be dangerous . I 'm not talking about the time the young fellow I had working for me said , " I wonder what makes the tides . " " The moon makes the tides , " I told him . He laughed . " You must think I 'm pretty stupid , pulling my leg like that . Really , what makes the tides ? " That sort of response merely makes your mind go blank . It leaves no room for discussion . But what I 'm getting at here are subtler points of science . Oh , yes , and another thing I 'm not going to do anymore : get up at 2 o'clock in the morning to go fishing . That 's how this whole business got started . Actually , we left at 2 , so I 'm not sure exactly when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have some time to prepare . The four of us were in Mort 's car : Mort , Retch , Henry and myself . Mort was driving . We were using Mort 's car because we had all decided that Mort owned the best fishing car by far . Mort was obviously pleased to have the best fishing car . It was his first fishing trip with the rest of us , and nobody had bothered to inform him that the three reasons his car was best for fishing were : 1 ) it had a motor ; 2 ) it had four wheels ; and 3 ) it belonged to Mort , not any of the rest of us . The Boulder River Road was one of the worst around . The stretch of the Boulder we like to fish the best lies up against the eastern side of the Snowy Range of the Rockies . As a result , it has a long twilight period , which is important to a proper understanding of this report . " Look at that moon up there , " Retch said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then he added thoughtfully : " I wonder what holds it up . " Most people , fishermen in particular , would simply let this statement go , regarding it as nothing more than an expression of appreciation . But I , being a science buff of sorts , had to go and respond . " Well , probably its orbital speed along a rut formed in space . Kind of like spinning the ball in a roulette wheel , except the moon does n't slow down enough to fall out of the rut . " " Rut in space ? " Retch said . " I do n't see no rut in space . " " Yeah , " said Henry . " How can you have a rut in space ? " " It 's just space , " Mort said . " A bunch of nothing . " " Not so fast , numbskulls , " I responded . " Einstein pretty much proved that space is something . " " Yeah , it 's something , " Retch said . " It 's space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could prove that myself . You see anything between us and the moon ? " " Yes , but ... " I started to say . " Right , whatcha see is a bunch of nothing , " Mort said . " I give up , " I said . " I suppose you fellas all believe it 's an absolute certainty that the sun will rise in the morning . " A big laugh . " Well , yeah , " Retch said . " Otherwise , I would n't have bothered bringing my sunglasses ! " This got another big laugh . " Well , it is not an absolute certainty , " I tried to explain . " It 's only a very high probability . " " Like one hundred percent probable , " Henry said . " Just because the sun has come up every day for the last hundred billion years or so does n't mean it will come up tomorrow , " I said , ignoring the raucous shouts . Nevertheless , as we were later to learn , this simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun just might not come up . It must also be remembered that I was dealing with intellects the size of neutrinos . We eventually arrived at Henry 's cabin and moved our stuff in . By first light we were on the river in the delicate process of distinguishing a rock bump on the bottom from the strike of a steelhead . We returned to the cabin for lunch and were out on the river again by 1 o'clock . But we were beginning to fade . By 2 o'clock , I noticed that Mort had disappeared . " Anybody seen Mort ? " I asked . " He probably slipped back to camp and is drinking up all our brew , " Retch said . After further conjecture , this possibility was judged to be a probability . We immediately rushed back to the cabin , only to discover Mort asleep on the hillside , his hat over his eyes . Only two empties rested nearby , allaying our suspicions that Mort had undertaken a serious raid on our brew supply . Now , there are probably some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snoozing out alone who are not compelled to commit a practical joke on the sleeper . Retch and Henry are not members of that group . Scarcely did they realize that Mort was fast asleep than they had a plan in place . Indeed , one might easily suspect that they had been planning for just this opportunity for many months . With no apparent communication between them , they instantly rushed to the cabin and hauled out tent pegs and wooden stakes , anything that could be pounded into the ground , and they pounded in a virtual fence around the dozing Mort . Then they wound fishing line from stake to stake and peg to peg , until Mort was enmeshed in a net of monofilament . I watched with some interest , realizing , of course , that Retch and Henry could not help themselves . It is what they do . The work had been hard and apparently rewarding , but afterward Henry said , " Whew , I 'm beat . " " Me too , " said Retch . " I think we should all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that we three would go to the cabin and sack out for an hour or so , then wake up refreshed enough to fish the evening bite . Even more likely , it was assumed , we would be awakened by a roar from Mort . Time passed . The sun slipped behind the mountains and the long twilight settled in . Mort awakened and was immediately enraged , not by the net that had been formed around him , it later turned out , but by the fact that his friends had allowed him to sleep outside all night , when he easily could have been eaten by wandering creatures of the dark . This was his fundamental mistake . Mort assumed it was now an early , pre-dawn morning ! He stripped away the feeble line and pegs , grabbed his rod and headed upstream to go fishing . It being early morning , as he thought , it was natural to expect the day to grow ever brighter . As it happened , Mort got into the evening bite and soon had one steelhead after another hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stood up , stretched , rubbed his back and looked around . The " morning " had grown darker . He glanced at the sky . Clear . " Hold on a second , " he thought , as only Mort could . " The sun should be up by now . " He glanced at his watch . It was nearly eight . The sun had failed to rise ! He dropped his rod and took off in a dead run for the cabin , hoping to share his panic . He burst in . " The sun is gone ! " he shouted . " The sun is gone ! " Six feet instantly hit the floor . " What do you mean the sun is gone ? " I asked . " The sun is supposed to be gone . It 's night . We overslept ! " " No , you dirty rats let me sleep out all night , " Mort yelled back . " But I forgive you , ' cause we 're all going to die anyway ! " " Holy cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's right , we did sleep all night ! It 's already half past eight in the morning ! And the sun ai n't up ! " " Geez , " said Henry , staring at the floor . " And here I had decided to get married someday and have children . Now the sun do n't come up ! " " Wait a second , " I said . " The sun always comes up . " " You said it yourself , " Retch said . " You read all those science books and everything and they say it 's only probable that the sun will come up . And now it has n't ! " " I must have been lying , " I said . " I think the sun always comes up and ... " I glanced out the cabin window . " What 's that ? It 's the moon ! It 's nighttime ! You imbeciles scared me half to death ! " We drove home a couple of nights later , but I think all of us had a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think the other fellows did , too . Otherwise , why did they stand out in the yard and blow kisses at the sun each morning ? There was still one thing I wondered about , though : What really does keep the moon up there ?
