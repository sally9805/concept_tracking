DOWN Part ONE It 's a new elevator , freshly pressed to the rails , and it 's not built to fall this fast . * * * She does n't know what to do with her eyes . The front door of the building is too scarred and gouged to look at , and the street behind her is improbably empty , as if the city had been evacuated and she 's the only one who did n't hear about it . There is always the game at moments like this to distract her . She opens her leather field binder and props it on her chest . The game gets harder the farther back she goes . Most of the inspectors from the last decade or so are still with the Guild and are easy to identify : LMT , MG , BP , JW . So far she does n't particularly like the men who have preceded her at 125 Walker . Martin Gruber chews with his mouth open and likes to juggle his glass eye . Big Billy Porter is one of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lila Mae has returned to the Pit from an errand only to hear Big Billy Porter regaling the boys about the glory days of the Guild , before . While his comments are never specific , it is clear to everyone just what and who Big Billy is referring to in his croaking , muddy voice . Rebellious among the bureaucratic rows of the Pit , Big Billy 's oak desk juts out into the aisle so he can seat his bulk directly beneath one of the ceiling fans . He says he overheats easily and on the hottest days of the summer his remaining hair slides away from how he 's combed it , the strands easing into nautilus whorls . It 's a slow process and watching it is like waiting for a new hour . But it happens eventually . All the inspectors who have visited 125 Walker in the past have been Empiricists . As far as she can tell . When she gets fifteen years back in the record there are no more faces to put to the initials . She recognizes the initials from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met the people they belong to . JM , for example , is also listed in the inspection record of the elevator Lila Mae departed just half an hour ago , and EH , she 's learned over time , has a thing for worn guide shoes , something no one ever looks at except the real stickler types . Checking guide shoes is a losing proposition . Some of the initial men must be in the pictures along the walls of the Pit . The men in those pictures sport the regulation haircuts the Guild required back then , respectable haircuts fit for men of duty and responsibility . The haircuts are utilitarian mishaps that project honor , fidelity , brotherhood unto death . The barber shop two doors down from the Guild , the one that always has big band music coming from inside , used to specialize . Or so they say . Some of the younger inspectors have started wearing the haircut again . It 's called a Safety . Lila Mae 's hair parts in the middle and cups her round face like a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this street , is the secondhand gray of ghetto twilight , a dull mercury color . She rings the superintendent again and hears a tinny bleating sound . Down twenty years in the record she finds one of the treasures that make the game real : James Fulton and Frank Chancre inspected 125 Walker within six months of each other . From Lila Mae 's vantage , it is easy to read into this coincidence the passing of the crown . Not clear why Fulton left his office to hit the field again , though . Twenty years ago he would have been Dean of the Institute and long past making the rounds of the buildings , ringing superintendents , waiting on worn and ugly stoops . Then she remembers Fulton liked to go into the field every now and again so he would n't forget . Fulton with his mahogany cane , rapping impatiently on one of the three windows set in the front door of 125 Walker . Perhaps they were n't cracked then . Perhaps he cracked them . Across from his initials the inspection record notes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizes the handwriting from Fulton 's room at the Institute , from the tall wooden display cases where his most famous papers are kept behind glass , in controlled atmospheres . As for Chancre , he would have been a young and rising inspector back then . A little thinner , fewer exploded capillaries in his nose . He would n't have been able to afford his double-breasted navy suits on a rookie 's salary , but his position has changed since those days . Lila Mae sees Chancre swallowing the super 's hands with his oversized mitts in faltering camaraderie . It takes a long time to become a politician , but he was born with the smile . You ca n't fake smiles like that . Nice building you got here , chum . Nice to see a man who takes pride in his craft . Sometimes you walk into these places , you never know what you 're going to see , bless my heart . You want to say to yourself , how can people live like this , but then we are all dealt differently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , we . . . He gave 125 Walker a clean bill . Lots on his mind , lots on his mind . The wind is trapped in one of Walker Street 's secret nooks , pushing through , whistling . The elevator is an Arbo Smooth- Glide , popular with residential building contractors when 125 went up . Lila Mae remembers from an Institute class on elevator marketing that Arbo spent millions promoting the Smooth-Glide in the trades and at conventions . They were the first to understand the dark powers of the bikini . On a revolving platform festooned with red , white and blue streamers , slender fingers fan the air , summoning the contractors hither . The models have perfect American navels and the air is stuffy in the old convention hall . A placard overlooked for red-blooded distraction details in silver script Arbo 's patented QuarterPoint CounterWeight System . Has this ever happened to you ? You 've just put the finishing touches on your latest assignment and are proud as a peacock to show off for your client . As you ride to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to budge . You wo n't be working with them anymore ! Say goodbye to sticky , stubborn counterweights with the new Smooth-Glide Residential Elevator from Arbo . Over two million Arbo elevators are in use worldwide . Going up ? A bald head girdled by loose curls of red hair appears at the door 's window . The man squints at Lila Mae and opens the door , hiding his body behind the gray metal . He leaves it to her to speak . " Lila Mae Watson , " she says . " I 've come to inspect your elevator . " The man 's lips arch up toward his nose and Lila Mae understands that he 's never seen an elevator inspector like her before . Lila Mae has pinpointed a spot as the locus of metropolitan disaffection . A zero-point . It is situated in the heart of the city , on a streetcorner that clots with busy , milling citizens during the day and empties completely at night except for prostitutes and lost encyclopedia salesmen . It 's a two-minute walk from the office . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much suspicion , curiosity and anger she will rouse in her cases . 125 Walker is at the outer edges of the city , near the bank of the polluted river that keeps the skyscrapers at bay from the suburbs , and quite a distance from the streetcorner : He does n't like her . " Let me see your badge , " the man says , but Lila Mae 's hand is already fishing in her jacket pocket . She flips open her identification and holds it up to the man 's face . He does n't bother to look at it . He just asked for effect . The hallway smells of burning animal fat and obscure gravies boiling to slag . Half the ceiling lights are cracked open or missing . " Back here , " he says . The superintendent seems to be melting as he leads Lila Mae across the grime-caulked black and white hexagonal tile . His bulbous head dissolves into shoulders , then spreads into a broad pool of torso and legs . " How come Jimmy did n't come this time ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lila Mae does n't answer him . Dark oil streaks his forearms and clouds his green T-shirt . A door bangs open upstairs and a loud female voice yells something in the chafing tones reserved for disciplining children and pets . The lumpy , pitted texture of the cab 's door tells her that management has painted it over a few times , but Lila Mac still recognizes the unusually wide dimensions of an Arbo Smooth-Glide door . Taking their cue from the early days of passenger-response criticism , Arbo equipped their newest model with an oversized door to foster the illusion of space , to distract the passenger from what every passenger feels acutely about elevators . That they ride in a box on a rope in a pit . That they are in the void . If the super does n't strip the old paint the next time he renovates , it will eventually impede the movement of the door . ( Of course a lot of graffiti in this neighborhood . ) Already the elevator door halts in its furrows when it opens . A violation waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lila Mae decides against saying anything to the super . It 's not her job . " You 'll want to start in the machine room , I guess , " the super says . He 's fixated on the ideal triangularity of Lila Mae 's tie knot , its grid of purple and blue squares . The tie disappears near her bosom , gliding beneath the buttons of her dark blue suit . Lila Mae does not answer him . She leans against the dorsal wall of the elevator and listens . 125 Walker is only twelve floors high , and the vibration of the idling drive does n't diminish that much as it swims through the gritty loop of the diverting pulley , descends down the cables , navigates the suspension gear , and grasps the car . Lila Mae can feel the idling in her back . She hears the door operator click above her in the dark well and then the door shuts , halting a small degree as the strata of paint chafes . Three Gemco helical springs are standard-issue buffers on Arbo elevators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press twelve , " Lila Mae orders the super . Even with her eyes closed she could have done it herself , but she 's trying to concentrate on the vibrations massaging her back . She can almost see them now . This elevator 's vibrations are resolving themselves in her mind as an aqua-blue cone . Her pen rests in her palm and her grip loosens . It might fall . She shuts out the sound of the super 's breathing , which is a low rumble lilting into a wheeze at the ultimate convexity of his exhalation . That 's noise . The elevator moves . The elevator moves upward in the well , toward the grunting in the machine room , and Lila Mae turns that into a picture , too . The ascension is a red spike circling around the blue cone , which doubles in size and wobbles as the elevator starts climbing . You do n't pick the shapes and their behavior . Everyone has their own set of genies . Depends on how your brain works . Lila Mae has always had a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor landing , an orange octagon cartwheels into her mind 's frame . It hops up and down , incongruous with the annular aggression of the red spike . Cubes and parallelograms emerge around the eighth floor , but they 're satisfied with half-hearted little jigs and do n't disrupt the proceedings like the mischievous orange octagon . The octagon ricochets into the foreground , famished for attention . She knows what it is . The triad of helical buffers recedes farther from her , ten stories down at the dusty and dark floor of the well . No need to continue . Just before she opens her eyes she tries to think of what the super 's expression must be . She does n't come close , save for that peculiar arching of his lips , but that does n't count because she already saw that from when he opened the front door . The super 's eyes are two black lines that withdraw indistinguishably into the skein of his hieroglyphic squint . His lips push up so far that his nostrils seem to suck them in . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overspeed governor , " Lila Mae says . The door opens slowly in its track and the drive 's idling vibration is full and strong , up here so close to the machine room . " But you have n't even looked at it , " the super says . " You have n't even seen it . " He is confused , and tiny pricks of blood speckle his pink cheeks . " I 'm going to have to cite you for a faulty overspeed governor , " Lila Mae repeats . She 's removing the tiny screws from the glass inspection plate on the left anterior wall of the elevator . The side of her screwdriver reads , PROPERTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ELEVATOR INSPECTORS . " It catches every six meters or so , " Lila Mae adds as she withdraws the inspection slip from beneath the glass . " If you want , I can get my handbook from the car and you can see the regulations for yourself . " " I do n't want to look at the damn book , " the super says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she signs the slip and replaces the plate . " I know what the book says . I want you to look at the damn thing yourself . It 's running fine . You have n't even been upstairs . " " Nevertheless , " Lila Mae says . She opens her field binder and writes her initials at the bottom of the ID column . Even from the twelfth floor , she can still hear the woman downstairs yelling at her children , or what Lila Mae supposes to be children . You never know these days . " You are n't one of those voodoo inspectors , are you ? Do n't need to see anything , you just feel it , right ? I heard Jimmy make jokes about you witch doctors . " She says , " Intuitionist . " Lila Mae rubs the ballpoint of the pen to get the ink flowing . The W of her initials belongs to a ghost alphabet . The super grins . " If that 's the game you want to play , " he says , " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three twenty-dollar bills in his oily palm . He leans over to Lila Mae and places the money in her breast pocket . Pats it down . " I have n't ever seen a woman elevator inspector before , let alone a colored one , but I guess they teach you all the same tricks . " The door of apartment 12-A cracks behind Lila Mae . " What 's all this noise in the hall ? " a high , reedy voice asks . " Who 's that hanging out there ? What you want ? " The super pulls 12-A 's door firmly shut and says , " You just mind your own business , Missus LaFleur . It 's just me . " He turns back to Lila Mae and smiles again . He sticks his tongue into the hole where his two front teeth used to be . Arbo did n't lie about their QuarterPoint CounterWeight System . It rarely fails . A regrettable incident in Atlanta kicked up a lot of fuss in the trades a few years back , but an inquiry later absolved Arbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's overspeed governors are another matter , though , notoriously unreliable , and probability says their famous manufacturing defect should have emerged long ago . Sixty bucks is sixty bucks . " You 'll get a copy of the official citation in a few days in the mail , and it 'll inform you how much the fine is , " Lila Mae says . She writes 333 in 125 Walker 's inspection record . The super slaps the door of 12-A with his big hand . " But I just gave you sixty dollars ! Nobody has ever squeezed me for more than sixty . " He 's having trouble keeping his trembling arms still at his chest . No , he would n't mind taking a swipe at her . " You placed sixty dollars in my pocket . I do n't think I implied by my behavior that I wanted you to bribe me , nor have I made any statement or gesture , such as an outstretched palm , for example , saying that I would change my report because you gave me money . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves her hand toward a concentration of graffiti " I see it as a curious , although in this case fortuitous , habit of yours that has nothing whatsoever to do with me . Or why I 'm here . " Lila Mae starts down the stairs . After riding elevators all day , she looks forward to walking down stairs . " If you want to try and take your sixty dollars off me , you 're welcome to try , and if you want to challenge my findings and have another person double-check the overspeed governor , that 's your right as a representative of this building . But I 'm correct . " Lila Mae abandons the super on the twelfth floor with the Arbo Smooth-Glide . The super cusses . She is right about the overspeed governor . She is never wrong . She does n't know yet . * * * All of the Department 's cars are algae green and shine like algae , thanks to the diligent ministrations of the motor pool . On the night of his inauguration Chancre gripped the lectern with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gold badge of his office hung over his shoulders by a long , patriotic ribbon . " Department vehicles , " he thundered , " must be kept in a condition befitting the Department . " To much applause in the dim banquet room of the Albatross Hotel . Those seated at the long oval tables , gathered around Mrs. Chancre 's unholy floral arrangements , easily translated Point Number Seven to the more succinct " Those colored boys better put a shine on those cars . " One of the mechanics , Jimmy , has a secret crush on Lila Mae . Not completely secret : Lila Mae 's sedan is the only one that gets vacuumed daily , and each morning when she leaves the garage for the field the rearview mirror has been adjusted from the night shift 's contortions , to just the way she likes it . Jimmy is a slender character among the burly crew of the motor pool , and the youngest . The calluses on his hands are still tiny pebbles in his flesh . The traffic at quitting time is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions them at strategic overpasses to describe the gnarls and tangles . Lila Mae is never able to differentiate these men from the meandering isolates who linger at the margins of freeways . All of them make obscure , furtive gestures , all share a certain stooped posture that says they lack substantive reasons for being where they are , at the side of the road . Impossible to distinguish a walkie-talkie from a bottle of cheap wine at such distances . They do n't have alibis , Lila Mae appraises the men at the side of the road . Her sedan limps through black glue . The WCAM sentry warns of an accident up ahead : A schoolbus has overturned , and as the passing commuters rubberneck and bless themselves , the traffic clots . Over here , honks a woman in a red compact . The light trilling of her car horn reveals its foreign birth , cribside cooing in Mien tongues . Lila Mae thinks car horns work backward : they do n't prod and urge the laggard ahead but summon those behind , come up , follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens to the news reports of WCAM , the red brake lights smoldering on the road ahead . Each of the announcer 's words have the routine elegance , the blank purity Lila Mae associates with geometry . The announcer says that a low-pressure system is rolling east . The announcer says that there 's been an accident at the Fanny Briggs Memorial Building . An elevator has fallen . Now we 're cooking . Lila Mae turns on her Department radio and hears the dispatcher call her inspector 's code . " Come in , Z34 . Report Zulu-three-four . " " This is Z34 reporting to base , " Lila Mae says . " Why have n't you reported back , Z34 ? " Contrary to prevailing notions , the elevator inspector dispatch room is not filled with long consoles staffed by an able company who furiously plug and unplug wires from myriad inputs , busily routing . The dispatch room is a small box on the top floor of the office and there 's only one person on duty at a time . It is very neat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Lila Mae 's imagination he is a skinny man with brown hair who withers in his revolving chair , dressed in suspendered slacks and a sleeveless undershirt . She 's never seen a dispatcher , and she 's only seen their room once , on her first day of work . He must have been in the bathroom , or making coffee . " I was on a call , " Lila Mae responds . " 125 Walker . I just stepped in the car . " No one is going to catch her in that lie . Lila Mae always turns off the radio when she 's finished for the day . Occasionally one of the night shift calls in sick and Craig wants her to fill in for a few hours . Until the city and the Department work out their overtime policies there 's no way Lila Mae is going to fill in for the night shift . If you have n't killed your hangover by six o'clock , you should take your lumps , is what she thinks . " You 're to report back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , " Zulu , thirty-four . " " What 's this crap about the Briggs building ? " Lila Mae asks . " You 're to report back here immediately , Z34 . Chancre wants to talk to you . And I do n't think I have to quote you Department regs on profanity over city frequencies . Dispatch out . " Lila Mae returns to WCAM , hoping for more details . For some reason Craig 's being a hardass , and that 's not good . She considers steering over to the shoulder to bypass the traffic , brandishing her inspector credentials should a policeman stop her . But the police and the elevator inspectors have a difficult past , and it 's doubtful a cop would let her off the hook , even for city business . Of course the city has never answered Chancre 's repeated requests for sirens . No one outside the Guild seems to think they 're necessary for some reason . Over the radio , one of the WCAM sentries ahead comments on how long it 's taking the emergency techs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered an oral report on Fanny Briggs in the third grade . Fanny Briggs was in the newer encyclopedias . Some even had her picture . Fanny Briggs looked tired in the marginalia ; her eyelids drooped and her jowls oozed down from her cheekbones . Lila Mae stood in front of Ms. Parker 's third-grade class and trembled as she started her report . She preferred to fade into the back rows , next to the rabbit cages , beneath the awkward pastels of the spring art project . There she was at Ms. Parker 's desk , and her index cards shook in her tiny hands . " Fanny Briggs was a slave who taught herself how to read . " One time a radio program featured Dorothy Beechum , the most famous colored actress in country , reading parts of Fanny Brigg 's account of her escape North . Lila Mae 's mother called her into the drawing room . Lila Mae 's legs dangled over her mother 's lap as she leaned toward the brown mesh of the radio speaker . The actress 's voice was iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more liberal quarters of her audience , who murmured about noble struggle . Tiny particles of darkness pressed beyond the cracked , wheaty mesh of the speaker , the kind of unsettling darkness Lila Mae would later associate with the elevator well . Of course she 'd do her oral report on Fanny Briggs . Who else was there ? No much progress in this traffic . The times are changing . In a city with an increasingly vocal colored population who are not above staging tiresome demonstrations for the lowlier tabloids , or throwing tomatoes and rotten cabbages during otherwise perfectly orchestrated speeches and rallies it only makes sense to name the new municipal building after one of their heroes . The Mayor is not stupid ; you do n't become the ruler of a city this large and insane by being stupid . The Mayor is shrewd and understands that this city is not a Southern city , it is not an old money city or a new money city but the most famous city in the world , and the rules are different here . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there have been few complaints , and fewer tomatoes . When Lila Mae was assigned the Fanny Briggs Memorial Building , she thought nothing of it . It made sense that it would be either her or Pompey , the only two colored inspectors in the Department . Chancre 's no fool . There are , after all , election years in the Elevator Guild too , and this is one of them , and all sorts of unexpected things have been happening . The Department-wide $1.25 raise , for example , which according to Chancre really adds up to a pretty penny after a while . Not that the elevator inspectors , civil-servant to the core despite their maverick reputations and occasionally flashy antics , needed to be convinced of the importance of a $1.25 raise . A government job is a government job , whether it 's inspecting elevators or railroad cars full of hanging meat , and anything that brings their salaries into closer proportion to their contributions to the American good are accepted cheerfully , election-year ploy or no . Same thing with the screwdrivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new screwdrivers were on their way , few cared that the Guild Chair was so naked in his attempt to score points with the electorate . For the new screwdrivers were quite beautiful . Ever since the city granted license to the Department , bulky and ungainly screwdrivers had poked and bulged in the jacket pockets of the elevator inspectors , completely ruining any attempts at dapperness and savoir faire . It 's difficult to look official and imposing while listing to one side . The new screwdrivers have mother-of-pearl handles and heads the exact width of an inspection-plate screw . They fold out like jackknives and lend themselves to baroque fantasies about spies and secret missions . And who can argue with that ? So when the word spread that Lila Mae had been assigned the 18-deep elevator stack in the Fanny Briggs Memorial Building ( 18-deep ! ) , a career-making case for any inspector , few were surprised and whatever ground Chancre lost among the Old Dogs of the Guild was more than compensated for by the goodwill generated by the raise and the new mother-of-pearl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment that it was meant to draw attention from Chancre 's opponent in the race for the Guild Chair , the liberal Orville Lever , who apparently thinks that only Intuitionists are capable of building coalitions , shaking hands with fundamentally different people , etc . Lila Mae ( who , by the way , is still not making much headway in the evening traffic ) may be an Intuitionist , but she is a colored woman , which is more to the point . Chancre 's assistant left a note on her desk : Your good service wo n't be forgotten after the election . As if she needed to be bribed with a vague promise of promotion ( and probably a lie anyway ) . It 's her job . She 's taken an oath and such things are to be taken seriously . Lila Mae held the note in her small hands , and even though she did not look up from her desk she knew that all of them , the Old Dogs and the New Guys in their retrograde Safety haircuts , were looking at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lila Mae is situated quite far downstream ) , they probably knew she got the case before she did . Probably skinny Ned , that vapor , that meandering cumulus masquerading as a man , sentenced to desk duty after the infamous Johnson Towers debacle , talked to a guy who talked to a guy in Chancre 's inner circle and the word came down : the colored gal gets the job . Not any of them , not Pompey . There are no surprises in election years , just a bit more static . And here 's Chancre now , arms struts at the tails of his signature double-breasted suit , twenty feet tall on a billboard for the United Elevator Co . Lila Mae 's car creeps through the bottleneck at the entrance to the tunnel so there 's no missing him . No more honking for this glum procession they can see the tunnel now , and there is always the mandatory period of pensive anticipation on entering the tunnel . ALL SAFE declares the copy across his feet , a play on Otis 's famous declaration at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean much to the people in the cars around Lila Mae - elevator ads probably only register in civilian heads as a dim affirmation of modernity , happy progress to be taken for granted and subconsciously cherished but Otis 's phrase is the hoist pulling her and her fellow inspectors out of bed each morning . The sacred motto . Even long observers of the mysterious ways of corporate vanity are hard-pressed to understand the sudden ubiquity of elevator ads . In addition to billboards like the one towering over Lila Mae fight now , the elevator industry 's advertisements line park benches , adorn the buses and subways of the city 's transit system , brace the outfield walls of baseball stadiums , bright non sequiturs . Other places , too . One time before the start of a double feature at her favorite movie house the Marquee on Twenty-third Street , notorious among those in the know for its free popcorn refills Lila Mae sat astonished as a thirty-second movie reel introduced American Elevator 's new frictionless drive . From time to time Lila Mae still catches herself humming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frictionless drive in question is just American 's old 240-60 drive in a smart new housing . It 's a relatively recent phenomenon , the vocality of the international short-range vertical transport industry , and there 's no one to explain it . How much Chancre makes in endorsements each year is anyone 's guess , but it goes without saying that he has a lot riding on his reelection to Guild Chair . Just look at him up there . So far Lila Mae thinks her role in the campaign is limited to window dressing - evidence for the new , progressive face of the Elevator Guild , and by extension , city government . She does n't know yet . She 's almost inside the tunnel when WCAM finally decides to update the situation at the Fanny Briggs Memorial Building . The yellow tiles inside the tunnel glisten and Lila Mae sees a long throat strangled by mucus . In his geometric voice , so full of planes , WCAM 's radio announcer says that Chancre and the Mayor will be holding a press conference to discuss what transpired at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can say something more , something tangible that Lila Mac can use to prepare herself , the tunnel eats the transmission . Like that . Then there 's just the agitated scratch of static inside her sedan and the earnest humming of multiple tires on the tunnel floor outside . Near silence , to better contemplate the engineering marvel they travel through , the age of miracles they live in . The air is poisonous . Something happened . It was her case . Lila Mac drums her fingers on the steering wheel and relives her call to the Briggs building the day before . Those looking for a correlative to Fanny Briggs 's powerful , lumpy body in the shape of the building dedicated to her will have to bear in mind the will to squat that roosts in the soul of every city architect . Government buildings are generally squat rather than tall , presumably to better accommodate deep file drawers of triplicate ephemera . So it has been for generations . But who can resist the seductions of elevators these days , those stepping stones to Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects understand that the future is up , the future is in how high you can go , it is difficult to shake old habits . Habits clamp down on the ankle and resist all entreaties , no matter how logical . As it is in politics , the only victor in the end was ugly compromise . The Fanny Briggs Memorial Building hunkers down on the northern edge of Federal Plaza in the renovated section of downtown , burly and squat for five floors before launching into space with another forty stories of pure , unsullied steel . The net effect is chrysalid , a photograph of a glass insect emerging from a stone cocoon . When Lila Mae first walked up the broad stone steps of the building , she looked up at the monolith above and felt a trembling instant of vertigo : It was a big responsibility . The mandatory Latinate motto was engraved above the entrance . Lila Mac is outside the tunnel now and ca n't think of what she did wrong . She needs a plan . Keep cool , Lila Mae .
