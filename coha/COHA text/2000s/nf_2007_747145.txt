By spending extended amounts of time at a school prior to student teaching , preservice music teachers can develop a clearer image of the kind of teachers they want to be <p> How do we learn to teach music ? Do we learn by mastering a body of musical knowledge and skills ? What about the knowledge base presented to us in philosophy or psychology of education courses ? Must we observe students in their music classrooms so that we acquire more direct understanding of typical development ? Does this observation constitute learning to teach ? Surprisingly , little research has focused on the question of how we learn to teach music , in spite of the relatively long history of formalized music teacher preparation in the United States . <p> Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger have proposed a theory of situated ( earning , building on the idea of apprenticeship , which may help us . Lave and Wenger describe situated learning as participation in a community of practice , which they define as " a set of relations among persons , activity , and world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of knowledge , not least because it provides the interpretive support necessary for making sense of its heritage . " 1 They caution that situated learning is not a pedagogical strategy ; it is a theory , or a way to understand learning . <p> Several models of music teacher preparation draw on this theory . They attempt to prepare preservice teachers for the realities of contemporary schooling through significant field-based experiences during the initial stages of learning to teach . Small cohort groups of preservice music teachers are based together at the same school site , under the combined supervision of one experienced school music teacher and a university professor . One version of this kind of preparation is the Professional Development Partnership , described in more detail in the resources in the Suggested Reading list and modeled after what the Holmes Group has called a Professional Development School ( PDS ) : <p> A truism is that no one learns to teach in a university - one learns to teach in a school . The PDS , then , is a school where novice educators intern for extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university and school faculty who co-plan and co-teach the professional studies sequence. 2 <p> In most Professional Development Schools , preservice teachers take part in a medical-school-type rotation , first observing and teaching for a short time in the classrooms of all teachers in a specific grade level or subject area , then remaining in one of those classrooms for an extended internship . This model functions well for the preparation of elementary teachers and for subject-area teachers in language arts , math , social studies and science . It has not , however , worked as well for the preparation of music teachers , simply because we 're unlikely to find more than one full-time music teacher in an elementary school building or more than one choral or instrumental music teacher in a middle school or high school . A typical format for the Professional Development Partnership instead places a small cohort of preservice music teachers in a school , with an experienced cooperating teacher and a university professor , for two extended periods per week during a semester . The model operates with the assumption that the preservice music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several semesters prior to the student-teaching internship . <p> Participation in teaching music makes up the curriculum for the preservice teachers at the Professional Development Partnership sites . Learning to teach music , then , does n't mean merely acquiring new knowledge or abilities to perform specified tasks - although knowledge and abilities are acquired - rather , learning means " becoming a different kind of person with respect to the possibilities enabled by " this community of practice. 3 <p> The excerpts that follow are taken from conversations with or writings of preservice teachers who were based at one middle school Professional Development Partnership site . Their commentary is offered to give a richer picture of the possibilities of situated learning . More specifically , the commentary shows that situated learning for preservice music teachers consists of the following : Access to exemplars of music-teaching practice Engagement in productive music-teaching activity Collaborative reflection Access to Exemplars of Music-Teaching Practice <p> When the experienced music teacher presents a compelling vision of music teaching , preservice teachers not only attend to this exemplar of teaching practice , but they also recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , we can read in the preservice teachers ' commentary their intentions to adopt or adapt the cooperating teacher 's practices . Thus , we see the seeds of their developing identities in the community of music-teaching practitioners and the beginnings of a teaching repertoire . <p> First impressions about the cooperating teacher are about the fluency of her musicianship . At once , the preservice teachers recognize that the cooperating teacher selects particular repertoire , familiarizes herself with it in an in-depth way , and engages learners by providing a proficient musical model in the classroom : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Commentary from preservice teachers also acknowledges the cooperating teachers organizational skills and daily preparation . It is evident to these prospective educators that the cooperating teacher 's preparedness is built on a firm foundation of musical knowledge , and her planning is designed to give her students a sense of continuity in their learning : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The preservice teachers acknowledge the high expectations that the cooperating teacher maintains for her students . However , they also recognize that the middle school students have a variety of musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By extension , preservice teachers are aware that the cooperating teachers expectations vary from student to student . So , it is not a uniformity of high expectations that impresses the preservice teachers ; rather , it is the cooperating teacher 's ability to differentiate expectations for the individual students , accompanied by the ability to help all students feel they belong and are making important contributions to the class : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Acknowledging that they were somewhat surprised to observe any formalized assessment in a school choir setting , the preservice teachers seem most impressed with the processes that the cooperating teacher put in place so that the middle school students could better evaluate their own growing abilities as musicians : PREFORMATTED TABLE Engagement in Productive Music-Teaching Activity <p> At a Professional Development Partnership site , preservice music teachers have opportunities to take on such teaching responsibilities as planning and conducting choral warm-ups , accompanying , tutoring students in sight-singing , and preparing students for solo festival . From the very beginning , the preservice teachers are productively involved in the life of the music classroom and the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the costs of errors are small . " 4 A benefit of this limited activity is that the preservice teacher can work closely with a few students , and in doing so , examine students ' thinking and the ways in which they make sense of music : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Preservice teachers might start to take on broader responsibilities , however . They might meet with school administrators , join the cooperating teacher at professional conferences , develop written assessments , and interact with parents and caregivers . As a preservice teacher 's investment of time in the school , the students , and the practices of music teaching increases , the preservice teacher develops a greater sense of belonging to the community of practice . PREFORMATTED TABLE Collaborative Reflection <p> During their time as participants at a Professional Development Partnership site , preservice teachers have opportunities for reflection . During group meetings , they discuss their observations and review their lesson plans with the cooperating teacher , the university professor , and each other . In their electronic journals , they reflect on what they have observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partnership site and respond to each other 's journal observations . Thus , at least some part of learning to teach involves preservice teachers learning from each other : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In their reflections , preservice teachers commonly compare their current observation and teaching experiences with memories of their own musical development : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Deborah Britzman reminds us that college students " bring to teacher education their educational biographies and some well-worn and commonsensical images of the teacher 's work . " 5 Collaborative reflection allows the preservice teachers ' images of teaching , constructed through memories of their own schooling , to become more clearly expressed . As the images become clear , they can be critically examined within the safety provided by the cohort group . This examination opens up the possibility that preservice teachers will revise their beliefs about music teaching , or about themselves as teachers : PREFORMATTED TABLE Changing People , Changing Practices <p> Learning to teach music is not limited to replicating the practices of a more experienced teacher , although access to exemplars of music-teaching practice is essential to beginning teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning to teach because it puts the prospective teacher in touch with younger students ' musical thinking and the ways in which they approach music . However , it seems important that the preservice teacher begin his or her teaching activity with minimal responsibilities and then move toward broader responsibility and greater investment in the community of practice as the preservice teacher develops a sense of belonging in the community . <p> The link between observation and productive activity is the act of critical reflection . It seems that collaborative reflection , whether face-to-face or mediated by technology , is one of the keys to learning to teach because it allows preservice teachers to learn from each other , and it offers an environment where changes in belief about music teaching might occur . <p> Recall that , from a situated perspective , learning is defined as becoming a different kind of person . Access to exemplars , productive teaching activity , and critical reflection together enable this change to occur . One further kind of change is likely , as Lave and Wenger describe : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even compelling and creative practices , will not be reproduced , but will be transformed . Changes are more probable as preservice teachers move out of the Professional Development Partnerships and into their own classrooms : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In a culture where curricula are standardized and demands for predictability are high , change in the practices of teaching may be a frightening prospect . But if we define learning as change to persons , to practices , and to communities of practice , then change is not only inevitable , but desirable . Our hope for the future of our art should rest on those who are learning to teach music . Suggested Reading Conkling , Susan Wharton .
