<p> Candles shoved into holders fashioned from Styrofoam cups flickered along the registration counter at the Los Laureles Lodge , giving the place a soft , romantic glow . <p> The befuddled clerk was n't thinking about romance . He was just trying to cope with a power outage caused by a tree that fell on some power lines several miles down the road . When the rains come here in the winter , hours without power are a good reminder that , despite the tasteful mansions and quietly exclusive lodges , this is indeed the country . <p> We had arrived on a rainy January afternoon , happy to be out of the city . As the clerk fumbled to hand-write our credit card number on a piece of notebook paper and consider which of the little cottages and rooms we might be able navigate best in the dark and cold , I laughed . Our intention was to spend a sleepy weekend among the landed gentry of the Carmel Valley , a genteel world of horses , wine-tasting rooms and luxury SUVs . The catch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't want to feel like the Joads . I did n't think our budget was so tight we would have to go without heat or electricity . <p> When we were searching for a room for the weekend , we landed at the Los Laureles Lodge because it offered a nice balance between price and atmosphere . The comfortable collection of rooms transformed from a country home and its stables had enough history and panache to make us feel like the getaway was special , and with rooms beginning at around $100 a night , it was affordable . <p> Although traffic knots up around San Jose and Morgan Hill , the Carmel Valley is a surprisingly easy drive from the Bay Area , one of those places that easily gets overlooked by weekend tourists heading to the spectacular waters of Monterey Bay or Big Sur . Even though Joan Baez made it something of a base camp for the peace movement in the late 1960s and ' 70s , the valley 's roots are definitely moneyed . Before World War II , it was a playground for millionaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play polo . And though it 's much more rustic , the valley has some of Carmel-by-the-Sea 's outright opulence . <p> In fact , Carmel is close enough that a little drive can make for a nice afternoon of window shopping and attempts at spotting local celebrities such as Doris Day and Clint Eastwood . <p> The valley technically begins when you turn east off Highway 1 onto Carmel Valley Road , just past Carmel . The well-paved highway has some twists and turns that can make it tricky to navigate , particularly on a dark , rainy night . During the day it 's a lovely , gentle drive that meanders through a wide river valley that cuts across part of the Santa Lucia range . <p> Though the Carmel Valley stretches for some 40 miles east , its heart , especially for weekend escapists , is the area in and around Carmel Valley Village . The little collection of stores , shops and lodging is 13 miles from the Highway 1 turnoff and minutes from where we set up camp at the Los Laureles Lodge . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasting Monterey County wine and looking at art . Robert Talbott Vineyards , Heller Estate/Durney Vineyard organic wine , Georis wines and Chateau Sinnet are clustered close by , along with five local galleries , a scattering of antique stores and a terrific place to browse for wrought iron and ceramic garden accessories at the Pot Farm . The Bernardus tasting room is a short drive away . <p> Hotel options are n't exactly plentiful here , where the crowning jewel is the relatively new and especially tony Bernardus Lodge . The makers of super-premium wines ( the Bordeaux-style Marinus is particularly well-regarded ) also offer a picture-perfect spa and restaurant set just so among the ancient oak trees that punctuate the hillside . Each of its 57 rooms has a fireplace and many a good view of the croquet lawn . But with rooms starting at $275 and topping out at $1,200 , a drink and an appetizer in one of its two restaurants was the closest we could get . <p> The more affordable Los Laureles Lodge was cobbled together from what was once the hunting and fishing lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's left of 7,000 acres of rancho land the Mexican government gave Jose Boronda in the 1830s . In the 1930s , Muriel Vanderbilt Phelps converted a carriage house into a ranch house and added extensive stables for her thoroughbred racehorses . Her swanky soirees were legendary , including " ocean parties , " when she had the pool filled with salt water for her guests . <p> An amiable young couple , Les and Mike Terry , own the place now . They take care of 26 rooms , suites and cottages . A pleasant restaurant presided over by chef executive chef Lisa Magadini offers local favorites such as sand dabs tempura , a monster half-pound cheeseburger and salads of local mixed greens and goat cheese . The menu tops out at $25 for a rack of lamb Nicoise style . <p> People interested in keeping the hotel bills low should ask for something in the courtyard , a strip of rooms converted from stables . The rooms are clean , not terribly big and feel just a little like roadside motel rooms , except they have a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley Motel 6 . ( Of course , no one would allow a travesty like a Motel 6 here , anyway . ) <p> If you want to move into the $200 range , you can get one of the suites or separate little cottages that offer an even better feeling of seclusion and countrified elegance . <p> Somehow , we got lucky . A reservation mix-up coupled with the power outage landed us in one of two big suites built inside what used to be Muriel Vanderbilt Phelps ' house . It was cold and very dark when we opened the door . We were soaked from the walk from the car . The clerk offered not much help navigating except to say there was a gas fireplace . Fumbling around in the dark , we cranked it up . With the rain on the window and our aforementioned Honda budget , we were perfectly happy to toast ourselves in front of it until the power returned a couple of hours later . <p> There are two good places to eat in the Carmel Valley . Rustica is a busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salads make for a relatively inexpensive lunch . A little more interesting , though perhaps more limited , menu can be had at Corkscrew , the sweet European style bistro owned by Walter Georis , the valley 's renaissance man . <p> Georis , an artist , vintner and musician who also brought Birkenstock sandals to America , is particularly admired for his Georis Merlot . He also owns the romantic Casanova restaurant in Carmel . He recently acquired the plain dinner table where Vincent van Gogh ate several meals . Georis picked it up during a trip to France , where he made fast friends with the owners of the Auberge Ravoux , the inn just outside of Paris where Van Gogh spent his last days painting before he took his life . <p> The story of the table , which is on display at Georis 's Carmel restaurant , and the French country dishes the chefs are preparing in honor of it , are worth the drive back into Carmel for the evening . <p> Despite the wine and food that form the backbone of Carmel Valley culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaking up the calm vibe that seems to roll down the hillsides . Of course , much of what 's to do here involves two pursuits that can be pricey : golf and horses . There are three championship golf courses . And if you like the ponies , plenty of horse ranches offer clinics in everything from English riding to sulky and carriage driving . <p> But for people on a Honda budget and with good walking shoes , the 50 miles of trails that lace Garland Ranch Regional Park 's 4,500 acres are just the ticket . <p> The unambitious might be happy with a simple , flat 1.5-mile loop , while people in need of a cardio-burn to work off the wine and cheese can hump it up 2,000 feet to Snively 's Ridge . <p> There 's plenty of free parking right off Carmel Valley Road . And the lot is usually full of Hondas . <p>  --  GETTING THERE <p>  --  Carmel Valley is about 120 miles south of the Bay Area .
