// My husband , Jack , and I found our dream home three years ago along a back road in pastoral Lancaster County , Pennsylvania . The patchwork of fields , pastures and woods looks like a colorful quilt spread over the hills , and warm and cozy is how Jack and I feel in this valley . Communities of Anabaptists - Amish and Mennonite people - founded this farming area nearly 300 years ago , and they remain the primary inhabitants today . Many are of the Old Order , choosing to live as their ancestors did . These people dress plainly ( the women wear dresses , aprons and bonnets ) and travel by horse and buggy . When Jack and I decided to escape the frantic pace of Philadelphia , we spent many weekends driving in the country , hoping to find a little fixer-upper . One such weekend , we ended up in an area called Churchtown , crossed an old covered bridge and spotted a vacant house just down the road with a " For Sale " sign out front . " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and looked in the windows . The house appeared to have been vacant for some time . We could see that everything would have to be redone - stripped to the bare bones . When we walked out back and saw the view , though , we both gasped . A little stream ran through the back yard , which bordered on a lush pasture . Beyond that , beautiful farms stretched as far as we could see . My heart beat faster . I just knew this was the home meant for us . I knew I could look at that view for the rest of my life and never get tired of its beauty and serenity . We called the real estate agent and made an offer on the spot . We spent our weekends working on the house , but progress was so slow , we decided to take the summer off and move in - basically , camp out in the house . Our first step was to put in a woodstove so we could pump water out of the well and heat it up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to redo all the electric wiring , and when we cut that line , we cut off the running water , too . Oil lamps served as lights , and our ice chest held cold drinks and such . We learned to get along without any frills .

Although our electric lights were more convenient , they seemed too bright after living with the oil lamps for so long , so we switched to 25to 40-watt bulbs and still prefer the oil lamps on quiet evenings . The major construction project was the second floor , which was only a half story with 6 feet of space on each side of the stairway . The sloped ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink ! We removed the entire floor and built a completely new second story . We hired someone to rebuild the outer shell , and then , we took it from there . Fortunately , Jack is a cabinetmaker , so he always has been a natural at home improvement . He already knew how to do many of the basic things we needed : He put in our new plumbing and electricity , and he even taught me to lay ceramic tile in the kitchen . Soon after moving in , we added a deck onto the back of the house , so we could sit and enjoy the view , and watch the wildlife . We set up several bird feeders , too , and have seen more than 60 different species of birds , including a migrating bald eagle last fall . I am sure that the neighbors were a bit concerned when they heard that " folks from Philly " bought this house , but after they saw us carrying buckets of water from the well and living without electricity , they must have decided we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pleasant surprise when they started to visit , bringing fruit from their orchards and homemade sticky buns . People from as far away as 2 miles came by to introduce themselves ; others would nod or stick their heads out and say , " Welcome to Churchtown ! " as they trotted by in their carts and carriages . Photograph // I always have raised flowers , but until we moved into this house , I never had grown fruits or vegetables . The Mennonite farmer across the way readily lends a hand when any of our mechanical equipment breaks down , and his wife taught me how to put up tomatoes . I was so excited with our first real corn on the cob ! The next year , we added a second garden bed so we could have spring and summer crops , and I put up 32 jars of peaches and several quarts of homemade applesauce and jam . Last summer , I had surgery - and did n't have to cook for a week . Each day , a different neighbor brought in a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the table . Soon after , we were honored to be invited to an Amish church service , conducted in High German . It was fascinating to watch the ceremonial way things were done . At Christmas , I made pumpkin bread to share with all these neighbors , for we really do feel part of the community now . Jack and I appreciate our mellower life here in Lancaster County in other ways , too . In Philadelphia , I worked as a critical-care trauma nurse in a hospital ; here , I have a less stressful job in a retirement village . We 're still short on insulation in some spots , but to us , this old house is a palace . We continue to work on it and to learn more about this independent , carefree rural lifestyle . Here , we see more horses and carriages than we do cars , and children still play ball in the road . How could we possibly ask for anything else ?
