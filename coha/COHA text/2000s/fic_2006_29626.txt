Chapter One Commission Mirage RAIN PATTERED STEADILY through the leaves of the wood and dripped to the ground below . Two figures slipped between the trees , all but invisible in the darkness , silent under the cover of the rain . The one in the lead moved well , but the one trailing him moved better , ghostlike and undetectable , and he never knew she was there . Three men waited for him , crouching in a tight clump under an old elm and shivering in the rain . He came up to them and spoke in a low voice . " She 's alone . And looks like she 'll be bedding down soon enough . If we wait , she should be easy to take . " Hidden in the trees just a short distance away , the woman who had been following him smiled thinly . " I still do n't like this , " one of the other men hissed . " What if she 's got spells set up or something ? " The woman 's jaw hardened , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witch , " someone else said , with the tone of a man who 's said it several times already . " You saw her in the alehouse . She damn near cut that fellow 's throat when he called her one . And Tre would have said if she 'd been singing when he looked in on her . " " She was n't , " the spy confirmed . " Just talking to her horse , like anybody does . And besides , witches do n't carry swords , or play cards inalehouses . She 's just a Cousin . " " We 're wasting time , " the last of the men said . " Heth , you go first . You make friends with the horse so it do n't warn her . Then Nessel can knock her out . Tre and I 'll be ready in case something goes wrong . " " Some help that 'll be if she is a witch , " the fearful one said . " How else did she manage to get five Primes in one hand ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheated . Do n't have to be a witch to cheat at cards . Look , there 's four of us and one of her . We 'll be fine . " Ten of you would n't be enough , the woman thought , and her smile returned . Not against a Hunter . Not against me . Mirage did n't object to being accused of cheating at cards , especially not when it was true . She did object to being called a witch-or a Cousin , for that matter . And she objected to being driven out to sleep in a rain-drenched wood , when she 'd been hoping for a warm , dry inn . Now these idiotic thugs were planning on jumping her ? They deserved what they were going to get . She slipped away from the men and returned to her campsite . Surveying it , she calculated the directions Heth and Nessel were likely to come from , then arranged her bedding so it would look as though she were in it . The illusion was weaker from the other direction , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side should n't be able to see anything amiss . Then she retired to the shadows and waited . The men took their time in coming , but Mirage was patient . Just as her fire was beginning to burn low , she heard noise ; not all of the men were as good at moving through the forest as Tre . Scanning the woods , she saw the spy nearby , already in place . She had n't heard him get there . Not bad . Quiet whispers , too muted for her to pick out . Then one man eased up next to her horse . Ordinarily that would have been a mistake . Mist was trained to take the hand off any stranger who touched her . But Mirage had given her a command before leaving , and so the mare stood stock-still , not reacting to the man trying to quiet the noises she was n't making . Mirage smiled , and continued to wait . Now it was Nessel 's turn . The leader , who had slid around to the far side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward on exaggerated tiptoe , club in his hands . Then , with a howl , he brought the weapon crashing down on her bedding . Tre went down without a sound half a second later . Fixed on the scene in front of him , he never noticed Mirage coming up behind him . " She 's not here ! " Nessel yelled in panic . Mist , responding to Mirage 's whistle , kicked Heth in the chest and laid him out flat . Mirage stepped into the firelight next to the horse . " Yes , I am , " she said , and smiled again . Nessel , a credit to his courage if not to his brain , charged her with another yell . Mirage did n't even bother to draw a blade ; she sidestepped his wild swipe and kicked him twice , once in the chest and once in the head . He went down like a log . Mirage , pausing only to give Heth a judicious tap with her boot , leapt over the fire in pursuit of the last man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't enough of a head start . Mirage kept to an easy pace until her eyes adjusted once more ; then she put on a burst of speed and overtook him . A flying tackle brought him down . She came up before he did and stamped on his knee , ending any further chance of flight . Then she knelt , relieving him of the dagger he was trying to draw , and pinned him to the ground . " What did you think you were doing ? " she growled , holding the dagger ready . He was trying not to cry from the pain of his injured knee . " Gold , " he gasped . " Only that . We were n't going to kill you . I swear ! " " I believe you , " Mirage said . " And for that , you live . Provided you learn one little lesson . " He nodded fearfully . " I , " Mirage said , " am not a witch . Nor am I a Cousin . I have nothing to do with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good . And be sure to tell your friends . " She stood and tucked his dagger into her belt . " I do n't like people making that kind of mistake . " Then , with a swift kick to his head , she knocked him out . ECLIPSE SCOWLED as he shouldered his way through the crowds swarming through the streets of Chervie . The newer parts of the city , outside the walls built during the city 's heyday as an Old Kingdom capital , were more open in their plan , but here in the central parts even carts could n't make it down half the lanes . That had never been a problem for him before , but then he 'd never been in Chervie this close to the Midsummer Festival . It seemed that every resident of the city had packed back inside the Old Kingdom walls , along with all twelve of their country cousins . The sheer press of people made him twitchy and irritable . It was a relief to step into the alehouse he was seeking ; the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets outside . He scanned the patrons , dressed up for festival in beadwork and lace , and soon spotted a familiar and distinctive head . She found him at the same instant , and even across the room he could see her light up . He sidled his way between the tables and came up to her , grinning . " Sitting with your back to a door , Seniade ? What would our teachers say ? " " They 'd say I should have picked a different alehouse . Two doors on opposite walls , and hardly a seat to be found in the whole room . I decided to watch one and take my chances with the other . " He snagged a stool out from under a patron who had just stood to leave and settled himself onto it . " Well , I 'll watch your back and you watch mine . Not all of us have your reflexes , Sen. " She quirked one eyebrow at him . " You know , you 're the only one who still calls me that . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you still call me Kerestel . Old habits die hard , I guess . Or else we 're slow learners . " Mirage grinned . " Can you believe this crowd ? I 'd forgotten how seriously they take Midsummer in Liak . I knew Chervie would be full , but this is ridiculous-and the festival has n't even really started yet ! It 's a shock , after the quiet of the road . " " From what I hear , your trip was n't what I 'd call quiet , " Eclipse said pointedly . Mirage raised her eyebrow again . " I came here by way of Enden . An alehouse maid there treated me to-well , several things , but two stories in particular . One about how a soldier playing cards was almost knifed in their common room , and another about how four village lads showed up the next morning , bruised , bloody , and stripped of everything but their skins . " " They were lucky to keep those . I figured they owed me their coin for trying to steal mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't have actually stabbed him . " " Your fuse has gotten shorter , I see . Or did he have an extra deck up his sleeve ? " " No , " Mirage said , looking down . " In fact , I won the hand . " Eclipse leaned forward . " Void it . That again ? " " Yeah . " She sighed . Eclipse noted frustrated fury in her eyes when she lifted her head , but it was soon muted . " Same with the four fools . Except they thought I was a Cousin . " " So they 're idiots . Not all witches have red hair . And just because you do does n't make you one of them , or one of their servants . " " Tell that to the idiots who panic when I lay down five Primes . " His eyes widened . " You did that ? No wonder they were suspicious . " " It did n't take magic , " Mirage said , and grinned wickedly . " Just agile fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark look from a prim-mouthed merchant woman at the next table . " Void it , Sen , you 're going to get yourself killed ! Cheating at cards is not going to improve your reputation ! " She shrugged . " I was bored . " " Bored ? " He stared at her in disbelief . " Of all the people I know , you 're the last one I would expect to court trouble just because you 're bored . " Mirage gestured dismissively and looked away . He caught hold of her arm , worried . " No , do n't you brush me off . What 's wrong ? " She pulled her wrist free of his grip and sighed . " Nothing . I 'm just ... bored . " " Have n't you had any jobs lately ? " " Plenty . So many , in fact , that I 'm taking a rest ; Mist and I have been on the road for months . Three hires , all back-to-back . Courier run clear across the land from Insebrar to Abern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town farther out in the mountains was having trouble from bandits-ended up being some men they 'd turned out of their town for thievery . Then they said a village even farther out needed a bloody mountain cat hunted down . " Eclipse smiled , hoping to lighten her mood . " Looks like they took the term ' Hunter ' in the wrong sense . " Mirage snorted . " The saddest thing is , that bloody cat was the most interesting part of the whole series . It was a damn sight more intelligent than those so-called bandits . " " So that 's why you 're bored . " " Kerestel , I have n't felt challenged since ... since I got that commission two years ago . Remember , when I was sent to Hunt Kobach ? " " The one who tried to take the rule of Liak from Narevoi ? " " I went through seven domains after him . Finally caught him in Haira , not too long after I left you . That was tough , Kerestel . It made me work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then , though ... nothing . Routine . Boredom . " Eclipse eyed her and tried to gauge her exact mood . He had the answer to her problems tucked in his belt pouch , but right now , with her recent difficulties , might not be the time to bring it up . It might help , or it might be more trouble than it was worth . And speaking of trouble ... Distracted as he was by his thoughts , he had n't even seen the woman come in the door . Eclipse opened his mouth to warn Mirage , but it was too late . " Well , if it is n't the witch-brat , " the newcomer said , stalking up to them . She always stalked ; he did n't think he 'd ever seen her in a good mood . Mirage 's eyes sparked . She turned in her chair and leaned back with an air of pure , unadulterated arrogance . " Ah , Ice . So good to see your usual frigid self . " Ice 's own blue eyes smoldered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her usual state ; eye color was the only conceivable reason she 'd ended up being called " Ice . " Then she lifted her gaze to meet Eclipse 's , and suddenly her expression held a different sort of fire . " Well met , Eclipse . " " Keep your claws off him , Ice , " Mirage said , her voice flat . " I just ate lunch , and I would n't want to lose it watching you try your tricks on him . " " Taken already , is he ? " Ice asked with a malicious smile . Eclipse stiffened . He considered Mirage a sister ; most Hunters of the same school and year did . What Ice was implying was little short of incest . But Mirage , to judge by her own faint smile , had things well in hand . " No , dear . I 'm not so desperate that I have to seduce my own year-mate-although from what I 've heard about Lion , it seems your luck is n't so good . " Eclipse stifled a laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be making it up , but Ice 's expression suggested she was n't . Now it was his turn to add fuel to the fire . " Come , ladies , this is no talk for the week before Midsummer . This is a festival ! We should be celebrating ! Ice , please , join us in a drink . I 'm told this place has an excellent stock of silverwine . " He thought he heard a snarl . Silverwine-not a wine at all , but an appallingly strong vodka-was brewed in the Miest Valley , and was the drink of choice for Hunters from Silverfire , Mirage and Eclipse 's school of training . " Now , Eclipse , " Mirage said reprovingly before Ice could get any words past her clenched teeth . " This may be a festival , but you know Hunters should try to keep clear heads . Silverwine is hard on those not used to it ; we would n't want to lead Ice into trouble . " The inarticulate noises Ice was making were quite entertaining . She was such fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have short fuses . " I can drink anything you can , " Ice snarled finally . Red mottled her face and neck . Mirage smiled a touch too sweetly . " I 'm sure you can , my dear . " Ice could probably drink Mirage under the table ; Thornbloods prided themselves on the amount of alcohol they could down . But Ice was too infuriated to think clearly . " I 'm afraid , however , that I have important matters to attend to-ones that wo n't permit me to get drunk with an old friend . " " What ' important ' matters ? " Ice spat . " You spend your time catching wife-beaters and rescuing kittens from trees . " Eclipse hesitated . He and Mirage had played in these verbal duels before ; it was his turn to attack . And he had a very good response to Ice 's insult . The problem was , if he brought it out now , he might hurt Mirage more than Ice . Recovering from his pause , Eclipse made his decision . He slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll . Keeping his fingers over the seal , he waved it to get Ice 's attention . Both of the other Hunters froze , looking at it . Eclipse nodded , smiling . " A two-person commission , " he said , addressing the Thornblood . " Mirage and I will be handling it together . " The fury on Ice 's face was profoundly satisfying . Official commissions were rare enough that receiving one was an honor ; as far as he knew , she had n't been offered one yet , in seven years out of Thornblood . This would be his first as well , but the second for Mirage . Across the table , Mirage 's expression was incredulous . Eclipse was pleased by the delight in her eyes ; this was , he well knew , the answer to her complaints of boredom and inactivity . Commissions were always difficult , always a challenge . He just hoped she would n't kill him when she found out who had ordered the job . Ice was still apoplectic . " Who 's it from ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she tried to reach for it . " Uh-uh , " he admonished her , waving one finger in her face . " Authorized Hunters only . I 'm afraid you 'll have to wait with everyone else to find out what we 're up to . " He tucked the scroll back into his pouch . Once he got Mirage alone , he 'd tell her more . Mirage had smoothed her expression by the time Ice looked at her . She smiled at the Thornblood . " Do n't worry , Ice , " she said . " I 'm sure you 'll get your turn-some day . " That , coming from a Hunter two years her junior , was too much for the Thornblood . Growling , Ice turned and stormed out of the alehouse . As soon as she was gone , Mirage leaned forward . " When were you planning on telling me about this ? " Eclipse shrugged uncomfortably . " I was about to say something when she showed up . I 'm sorry ; I did n't mean to trap you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd turn a commission down ? " He stood to hide his discomfort . " Come on . Let 's go someplace more private to talk . " MIDSUMMER TRADITION IN CHERVIE meant that no one cooked and ate at home if they could afford not to , which meant that everybody with two coins to rub together was eating somewhere in the city 's public quarters . Prices skyrocketed , and space at tables , along counters , and under awnings became harder to come by than fresh fruit in winter . Mirage had to pay through the nose for a small , private dining room in a place called the Garden of Bells . It was more like a private closet than a whole room , but the Garden 's architecture was copied from an eastern style ; the fretwork walls would be very cold in Chervie 's northern winters , but on this summer day it was pleasantly cool . Besides , there was nowhere for an eavesdropper to hide . ( Continues ... )             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
