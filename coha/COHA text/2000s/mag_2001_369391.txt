If you dropped in on Capitol Hill from Mars last week , you might have thought George W. Bush had tapped liberals for two of his most sensitive Cabinet posts . John Ashcroft , the hard-right nominee for Attorney General , told astonished Senators at his confirmation hearing that he would " aggressively " enforce abortion laws and would n't challenge the Supreme Court 's Roe v. Wade decision , even though he has spent much of his career trying to overturn it . In another hearing room , Interior Secretary-designate Gale Norton , a James Watt disciple who used to champion the rights of oil companies and mine operators , insisted that she 's now a tree-hugging naturalist who believes in global warming and has a soft spot for the Endangered Species Act . <P> Frustrated Democrats complained of " confirmation conversion , " particularly by Ashcroft . As Missouri 's attorney general , he once risked a contempt-of-court citation for not enforcing school desegregation . But during four days of hearings he invoked Bobby Kennedy as a role model . " It seems there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans were surprised , according to Arizona Senator Jon Kyl , that Ashcroft seemed " so willing " to enforce laws he had previously opposed . <P> The makeovers appear to be doing their job . Norton and Ashcroft are both likely to win enough votes for confirmation . And conservative groups , who know how the game is played , are n't worried that their two favorite nominees have strayed . " I do n't think Ashcroft has changed his position on abortion , " says David O'Steen , executive director of the National Right to Life Committee . Democrats do n't believe it either . You 'd have to be from Mars to buy a story like that . <P>  --  By Douglas Waller/Washington
