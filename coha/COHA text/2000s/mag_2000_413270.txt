Southerners far and wide reminisce about Thanksgiving holidays past-with laughter , fond memories , and even tear or two . // The day before Thanksgiving in 1981 we had no money , no food , no nothing . Yet I went up and down our neighborhood and invited everybody to come to Thanksgiving dinner . My husband and I started cleaning our two-bedroom apartment , and I found 50 cents . I bought a lottery ticket for $1-and that dollar ticket paid $250 ! I took it to the grocery store , spent $200 on food , and fed 39 people . From this I created the Bea Gaddy Family Centers , and I 've been running ever since-running with a prayer to God . Bea Gaddy , activist for the homeless , Baltimore , Maryland A woman who had been with my grandparents for years came to help out with our holiday dinner . As she carried the turkey to the dining table , it fell onto the floor . She paused only a second , then picked it up very carefully , and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one : ' A few minutes later she returned with the " other one , " which bore a remarkable resemblance to the first turkey-which we never saw again . Mary Harrington , retired teacher , Charleston , West Virginia Memories of a newlywed : Ten friends were gathered around the table , and the feast was about to start . I wanted to begin with drama-pumpkin soup served in a large pumpkin . I had it warming in the oven while we had a toast with champagne . As I brought in the pumpkin , everyone applauded . I still remember my flush of pleasure ; this was Thanksgiving as I imagined it . Just as I was about to place the pumpkin on the table , the bottom fell out  --  covering me. the table , and two guests with hot orange soup . I never have eaten pumpkin since . Frances Mayes , Georgia native , author of the just-released In Tuscany Last year was the first year I ever had Thanksgiving at my own home . My mom and my wife put it together . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind being on the other end . I just carve the turkey and make the gravy . Donald Barickman , chef/owner , Magnolia 's , Charleston , South Carolina My grandmother , Alice Robertson Mitchell , taught me to keep a little " tin " of Thanksgiving throughout the year . When the mood strikes , you can jot down a note of thanksgiving and slip it into the tin-any day , wherever you are . Then , on Thanksgiving Day you open your tin and read all of the notes of thanksgiving right before your meal . Kathy Mitchell Wolfe , wife and mother , Franklin , Tennessee All the women in my family went to The University of Georgia , and most of the men went to Georgia Tech . Now that I 'm in New York , I still make sure the marshmallows are toasted just right on the sweet potatoes and that the corn pudding is the perfect consistency . But the Georgia-Georgia Tech game is the backdrop to our day-always . Watching this game every Thanksgiving proves to be more indigestion-inducing than the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3-year-old daughter even knows to yell , " To hell with Georgia Tech ! " We women have made sure all the kids know the Georgia fight song . Deborah Norville , Inside Edition , Georgia native Last year we had our first child . Will was born March 19th , and on May 20th our house burned down . In August , as the house was being rebuilt , it burned down again . All we said was , " Just let us be by Thanksgiving . " My brother was moving to Korea with the military , so it was going to be our last holiday together for while . We made it into our house about two weeks before Thanksgiving . It was quite a special time for our family Ron Pence , band director , Homewood High School Homewood , Alabama My favorite adult Thanksgiving memory is the birth of our two girls the day before Thanksgiving 19 years ago this fall . George and I wanted children very much . There were late pregnancy complications . I was moved near an infant intensive care unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy everything went well . I do n't actually remember much about that Thanksgiving Day . But George and I do both still remember and cherish the thanks we both felt-and still feel-on that Thanksgiving Day and every one ever since . Laura Bush , First Lady of Texas Austin , Texas We had Thanksgiving in Seattle last year on tour with the Rolling Stones . Bernard Fowler , one of the singers , went to the hotel kitchen and did black  --  eyed peas and cornbread . Another singer , Lisa Fischer , did the collard greens . Someone else cooked sweet potato souffle , and Keith Richards 's daughters made Rice Krispies treats . It goes to show you , no matter where you are , even in rock ' n ' roll , we still give thanks . Chuck Leavell , Rolling Stones pianist/ tree farmer , Dry Branch , Georgia Today our cottage on Sullivans Island , built in the 1800s facing the ocean , is my permanent home and is still that special place to come on Thanksgiving for my children . I still gather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses in my garden , the same old narcissus from the walk , and other offerings of late fall . Ruth Knopf , professional rose garden artist , Sullivans Island , South Carolina My father built a " play " farm in Rankin County , Mississippi , and we spent our Thanksgivings out there . I did n't want to spend the day in the country ; I wanted to be in the city . So to pass the time , I organized all types of games for the kids-foot races , three-legged races , silly old-fashioned games . Afterwards , the children printed up newsletters telling who won what races . It 's funny now how those children , as adults , talk about their happy memories of these Thanksgiving events . I laugh to myself and remember , without saying a word , why I did it . Ellen Gilchrist , writer , Fayetteville , Arkansas My fondest Thanksgiving memory ? Uncle Web 's prayers . THe one moment of silence has always been when we joined hands in a circle for Uncle Web to bless us all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . I miss him terribly , but I thank him for that tender moment , when every one of us truly knew the meaning of thankfulness and how precious is a family 's love . Pam Brandon , public relations ; Winter Park , Florida Like a string of pack horses , the memories of family Thanksgivings stretch across the back trail of my life . As I start drifting toward the western horizon of ny days , I 've come to realize something about my herd of memories and emotions . They are all packing one brand , the brand of a big ol ' caring family that is sometimes hurtful , but also loving and forgiving . Thank you , God , for a family that has taught me to treasure the feelings of this event instead of the event . F.D. Sky Shivers , cowboy storyteller/ Western humorist , Prague , Oklahoma You know , there 's always the dilemma of what to do with the leftovers . One Thanksgiving we remember as " The Year of the Turkey Loaf . " My mom , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so awful that my two sisters and I took one bite and began secretly passing it under the table to Mimi , our standard poodle . None of us knew the others were doing this . The poor dog was so sick for two days ! Maggie Radzwiller , restaurateur , Brightleaf 905 , Durham , North Carolina I was in Sherman , Texas , when the Cabbage Patch craze was the rage-and we were giving away one doll . But how do you choose among all these needy families ? I remembered a mother who had come in and asked for assistance for her little girl , so I went out to the house , a very poor , rundown little home by a railroad track . I took the doll to her the day before Thanksgiving . The mother and I both wept . It gave me an extra reason to be very thankful that Thanksgiving . Maj. Sharyn Hoosier , Salvation Army Texas Divisional League of Mercy Secretary , Dallas , Texas We 've celebrated as the site of the first official Thanksgiving for about 25 years formally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet family time into something rather public . We celebrate with a re-enactment of the landing the first Sunday of November . By the real Thanksgiving , we 're exhausted from pulling off the event , but we always try to have wild game . We 're open 365 days a year , but we eat upstairs , which is not open for tours . Malcolm Jamieson , owner , Berkeley Plantation , Charles City , Virginia I come from a very large family-might brothers , three sisters-so Thanksgiving was a time when there was just a horn of plenty . We 'd come and get it , then go outdoors because we did n't really have a room big enough for 12 to sit down and eat . It was n't what you had , it was the importance of the family coming together to give thanks . We did n't have the large table , but we had one another . Dr. Steve A. Favors , president , Grambling State University , Grambling , Louisiana My better " three-quarters " of 43 years is awe-inspiring , absolutely incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and her seven grandchildren . I remember so many holidays with my wife 's family . She learned to cook on a wood stove , and I still can see her grandmother using an old galvanized washtub to make dressing , you know , to mix all the ingredients together . Bob Timberlake , artist/furniture designer , Lexington , North Carolina On Monday , November 1 , last year , I received the sad news that a dear old acquaintance , Norman Shapiro , and his beloved wife had been passengers on EgyptAir Flight 990. 1 could not stop thinking about them , yet something good emerged from my thoughts of sympathy . I realized that no one religious group owns Thanksgiving Day . After all , the original pilgrim was the Hebrew patriarch Abraham , who set out to find a better country . I do n't want a Christian America , a Catholic America , or a Jewish America . I am happy with a truly Pilgrim America . On every Thanksgiving Day from now on , I will remember Norman Shapiro and all the hardworking immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims . And I will remember them with the prayer , " May my life always bring honor to their memory .
