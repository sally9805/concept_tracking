Section : Power Plays Politics Broadcasters are making millions from candidates ' ads , while cutting election coverage . But there is a way to revolutionize campaigns  --  for free . <p> Back in Mid-January , just as the presidential primaries were heating up , " CBS Morning News " anchor Bryant Gumbel indulged in a bout of on-air condescension about the campaign . " I stumbled upon Saturday 's debate , " he told viewers , " and it seemed a rather sad show . " <p> More and more these days , Gumbel 's disdain for politics is shared by his employers , who have come to view elections as little more than cash cows . Broadcast television 's game plan for Campaign 2000 has been to reduce coverage , restrict candidate airtime , and milk politicians for lots of expensive ads . <p> Gumbel stumbled on that debate only because he was n't watching ABC , CBS , or NBC . Of the record 22 presidential debates televised through the Super Tuesday primaries in March , just two aired on a broadcast network , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cable , where they attracted smaller niche audiences . <p> There was a time when broadcasters leaped at the chance to serve as unofficial hosts of the presidential campaign . It was a way to earn their spurs as newscasters ; to make household names out of their anchors and reporters ; to inform their viewers ; to serve the public interest . <p> Now they view politics as a burden , a bore , a " sad show . " At local stations , it 's now the ad sales manager , not the news director , who operates the only political desk on the premises . The February 28 issue of Broadcasting &; Cable magazine nicely captured the Gilded Age mindset of broadcasters toward politics . " Campaign 2000 , " trumpeted the cover . " Happy Days Are Here Again ; Ad Dollars Piling Up . " <p> Industry analysts estimate that candidates for federal and state offices will spend $600 million on political spots this year , a six-fold increase ( in inflation-adjusted dollars ) from 1972 . Almost all of that money goes to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 percent when the political season hits high gear . <p> " We 're salivating , " Patrick Paolini , general sales manager of the local CBS affiliate in Buffalo , New York , told Electronic Media when asked about the profit potential of the upcoming Senate showdown between Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani . " It 's like Santa Claus came , " added Don O'Connor , general sales manager at the Fox affiliate in Syracuse . Let 's follow the vicious cycle here . We the public give the broadcast industry our airwaves for free , in return for their commitment to serve the public interest . At election time , the industry turns around and sells airtime to candidates , fueling a money chase that saps public confidence in the political process and restricts the field of candidates to the wealthy and their friends . The money pays for ads that reduce political discourse to its least attractive elements : The spots tend to be synthetic , deceptive , inflammatory , and grating . <p> As campaigns choke on money and ads , the public drifts away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on substantive political coverage  --  forcing candidates to rely even more on paid ads as their sole means of getting a message out on television . And so the cycle keeps spinning . <p> This syndrome is most acute at local stations , which expect to convert more than half a billion dollars of campaign finances into campaign ads this year . Two recent studies paint a disturbing picture : In 1998 , the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California found that the state 's major television stations devoted , on average , less than one-half of one percent of their total news coverage to the governor 's race in the three months leading up to the election . Candidates who wanted to get on the air had to pay their own way  --  which is what they did , to the tune of a record $75 million for TV ads . That same year , a survey of local television news coverage in 25 states found that viewers were four times more likely to see a political ad than a political story during the late-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land of body bags , happy talk , health tips , weather , and sports . It 's never had much of a journalistic tradition of informing viewers about their political choices . But the national networks do  --  or once did . <p> As Gumbel was grumbling about the debates earlier this year , his network was dispatching a third fewer reporters and producers to Des Moines and Manchester than it had four years earlier . According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs , a media watchdog group , coverage of this year 's presidential campaign on network evening newscasts is down by roughly a third from 1996 ( when it was down by 50 percent from 1992 ) . Moreover , the coverage overwhelmingly emphasizes what has been called the " chess game of politics . " According to one survey , just 13 percent of campaign stories focus on political issues that touch the everyday lives of viewers . <p> " We are doing a very minimal amount of coverage at ABC , " veteran newsman Sam Donaldson conceded to the Dallas Morning News in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday show , ABC News in my view has simply forfeited the field . And there may be good reason for that . The cable networks are just omnipresent now . For us to run long programs in prime time as a public service does n't make a lot of sense anymore to our bosses . " <p> Donaldson put his finger on the historic transformation in the media during this presidential year  --  the explosion of new outlets for information on cable and the Internet . And he accurately characterizes his industry 's response : Hey , if you want this stuff , it 's out there . What 's the problem ? <p> One problem is that one-fourth of the American public does n't subscribe to cable , and half does n't go online . Do we really want to charge an admission ticket  --  in the form of a cable subscription or Internet service fee  --  for a front-row seat to the presidential campaign ? <p> Another problem is that cable and the Internet deliver political information only to those motivated to seek it . Fewer and fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to poison the well for politics by drowning the audience in a flood of ads . <p> Is there a better way ? In all but a handful of countries around the world , broadcasters are required to provide candidates or parties with blocks of free airtime so they can communicate directly to voters . But at home , our powerful broadcast lobby has blocked all such proposals for 70 years . <p> In 1996 , the National Association of Broadcasters staged the lobbying coup of the decade by convincing Congress to hand over tens of billions of dollars ' worth of new space on the public airwaves , free of charge , to facilitate the transition to digital technology . Senate majority leader Bob Dole called the giveaway a " giant corporate welfare program . " But broadcasters easily prevailed , backed by more than $20 million in political contributions and lobbying  --  and by their power to provide favorable coverage to members of Congress . As Edward Fritts , the trade association president , boasted , " No one has more sway with members of Congress than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cracks in this wall of opposition to airtime for candidates . In the wake of the spectrum handout , an advisory committee of broadcasters and public interest advocates appointed by President Clinton came up with a smart compromise designed to break the impasse . The committee recommended that all television stations voluntarily provide five minutes of nightly candidate discourse in the 30 nights preceding elections . The idea is to challenge the television industry to invent an entirely new kind of political campaign  --  one built around brief nightly forums among candidates for federal , state , and local office . <p> Five minutes may not seem like much ; in fact , it would be a revolution . During the height of the current primary season , by contrast , ABC , NBC , and CBS aired a nightly average of just half a minute of candidate discourse . Local stations aired even less . <p> Some 20 local stations around the country have pledged to meet the five-minute standard this fall . WCVB-TV , the ABC affiliate in Boston , already did so during the New Hampshire primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , issue statements , stump speeches , and debate footage . " We were pleased with the way it went , " says station manager Paul La Camera . <p> Twenty stations are , of course , just a drop in the bucket . There are 1,30 other commercial stations that have yet to sign on , including all of the affiliates owned by the industry giants . It 's clear that part of the resistance comes from a fear of lost ad revenue . " Once you give a politician five minutes of free airtime , he 's going to go somewhere else and spend the money he saved at your station , " says Perry Chester , general manager of the CBS affiliate in Champaign , Illinois . Even more disturbing has been the silence from the CBS network , whose president , Leslie Moonyes , served as co-chair of the advisory panel that made the recommendation in the first place . <p> It 's possible that the favorable response to campaign finance reform during the primaries will spur the industry to step forward . It could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four finalists in this year 's presidential field  --  Al Gore , Bill Bradley , and John McCain  --  are all outspoken advocates of mandatory free airtime for candidates . Perhaps that will concentrate some minds . <p> And perhaps not . The closest CBS has come to making good on the recommendation was to air a five-minute segment on Bradley during prime time on March 2 . It was a rare burst of exposure for a challenger who 'd been virtually blacked out by the networks after he narrowly lost the New Hampshire primary . But , alas , there was one problem that kept the segment from being the kind of innovation reformers are seeking . Bradley had to pay CBS $200,000 to air it . <p> By Paul Taylor <p>
