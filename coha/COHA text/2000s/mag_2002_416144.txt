Without The Extraordinary Dedication Of A Few Conservationists , New Zealand 's Kakapo Would Likely Have Gone The Way Of The Dodo <p> The helicopter hovered above the surface for a moment , then crashed into the water and began to sink . Inside , three men took in huge lungfuls of air . " One . two . three , " they counted , " . four . FIVE ! Go ! " They wiggled out , pushed open the door and shot toward the light . Two of the men burst to the surface and sucked in air while a third surfaced calmly . " That was good , gentlemen , " the third man said , floating alongside the two gasping ornithologists , " but we 'll have to do it again . Just so that you really get it nailed . " Technicians raised the helicopter simulator above the pool and prepped it for another drop . <p> Even among birders , who are renowned for the lengths they will go to indulge their passions , Don Merton , 63 , and Graeme Elliott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most senior member of New Zealand 's government-run Kakapo Recovery Programme , and Elliott is its research scientist . Their efforts on behalf of the shy , flightless parrot known as the kakapo include airlifting the few remaining birds to a remote and predator-free island in the Pacific . This island 's shores are so rugged that few boats can land . Thus the need for Merton and Elliott to undergo this rigorous helicopter training . <p> Why all this trouble for a bird ? Having encountered a kakapo firsthand , I think I understand . During the release of a bird called Sirocco on Codfish Island , located off the southern coast of New Zealand 's South Island , I watched as he climbed out of his box , shuffled up a horizontal branch and stretched his powerful limbs in a ballerina-like posture , using his wings for balance . I reached out my hand slowly , and Sirocco touched it with his stubby beak , then unceremoniously leaped onto my arm as if it were an extension of the branch and climbed up to perch on my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide brown disks around the eyes and a beak nearly obscured by feathery whiskers-next to mine , then stretched out toward a fresh shoot of a fern and began to munch noisily . He reminded me of a Persian cat . <p> Even after nearly three decades studying kakapos , Merton 's eyes still shine behind his square gold-rimmed glasses when he talks about them . He wears a shy smile and a big backpack and is happiest in the forest . Perhaps best known for his early 1980s rescue of the Chatham Islands black robin , whose numbers once dipped to five  --  including only two females  --  he has helped save a number of other species in Mauritius , the Seychelles , and Christmas Island . No bird , however , has tested Merton 's resourcefulness as much as the kakapo , which he calls " my ultimate challenge . " For 30 years now , in an effort unprecedented in the history of New Zealand conservation , Merton has been fighting a largely losing battle to keep kakapos alive : their numbers have declined steeply over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The remaining population-86 birds  --  has stabilized but is aging . <p> The kakapo was once abundant throughout New Zealand from sea level to snow line . " The birds used to be in dozens round the camp , screeching and yelling like a lot of demons , and at times it was impossable sic to sleep for the noise , " wrote the 19th-century explorer Charlie Douglas . On moonlit nights , Douglas went on , one could shake a tree and kakapos dropped like ripe apples . He also observed that their firm , fruity white flesh made " very good eating . " <p> Although New Zealand abounds in faunal oddities such as the kiwi bird , none of its creatures have attracted quite as much attention recently as the kakapo . Local newspapers raptly follow their sex lives , and the government sponsors nationwide contests for schoolchildren to name fledglings . But for all the ink spilled on the bird 's behalf , few people have ever seen one in the wild  --  and not only because it lives in remote sanctuaries but also because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blend in " strategy . It 's a strategy that works well against eagle-eyed raptors but does little to safeguard it against tree-climbing predators that hunt by smell . " If the bird only knew its powers , it would n't fall such an easy prey to stoats a kind of weasel and ferrets , " Douglas wrote in 1899 . " One grasp of his powerful claws would crush either of those animals , but he has no idea of attack or defense . " <p> The kakapo , of course , recalls the dodo ( the former resident of what is now the island of Mauritius , east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean ) , which became extinct 300 years ago . Like the dodo , the kakapo is a large and solitary creature too heavy to fly . Also like the dodo , it nests on the ground . Like the kakapo , the dodo was numerous and long-lived and a slow and infrequent breeder , which meant it could not bounce back once its population was diminished . <p> To be sure , the kakapo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand , the Maori , hunted them with such gusto that by the time Europeans arrived in the early 19th century , the bird had largely disappeared from North Island , the more populous of the country 's two main islands . European settlers , along with the pets and vermin they brought with them , accelerated the decline . Between 1949 and 1973 , the government wildlife conservation agency launched more than 60 search and rescue expeditions , mainly to the inaccessible mountains in the southwestern region of South Island , the kakapo 's final bastion , a tract of large beech forests and Yosemite-like rock faces . <p> In the 1960s , five birds were trapped in South Island 's Fiordland National Park , but all died in captivity . In the park in 1974 , Merton heard what he was certain were the distinctive shrieks and screams  --  somewhere between a donkey 's bray and a pig 's squeal  --  of an agitated kakapo . It took him two weeks to trap the old , bedraggled male , whom researchers named Jonathan Livingston Kakapo . Over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other volunteers combed the dense forest and cliff faces , turning up 17 additional males and a couple of mysteries : Where had all the females gone and what should they make of the immaculately groomed trails they found in the heavy vegetation , punctuated by round bowls of exposed earth about 1 feet wide and 5 inches deep ? It appeared , recalled volunteer Rod Morris , as if " we were stumbling across the ruins of a tiny , ancient civilization . " What did the birds use these bowls and trails for ? <p> Merton knew that Maori lore told of a whawharua  --  a secret playground where kakapos gathered to perform mysterious nightly rituals . As he and other researchers examined the freshly used bowls and tracks , the Maori story began to appear almost plausible . The area , the biologists concluded , was a kakapo nightclub of sorts , where males would gather to prance , display and make loud vocalizations in hopes of attracting elusive females . <p> Merton and his colleagues learned that the male kakapo , puffed up like a feathered balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small amphitheater , and sends out a pulsing , low-frequency call , known as booming , which sounds at first like someone blowing across the top of an empty milk bottle . As the calls continue , sometimes for as long as eight hours , the intensity increases until it resembles the blast of a foghorn : Ooooom ! Ooooom ! The long-wave hum can travel up to three miles . <p> In 1977 , against all odds , Merton and four two-man teams came upon an estimated 200-strong population of kakapo on 670-square-mile Stewart Island , New Zealand 's third largest , about 100 miles south of Fiordland . Again , all were male . Merton despaired . Had every female kakapo been wiped out by some disease or predator ? Was the species doomed ? Not until 1980 did a tracking springer spaniel on Stewart Island pick up a kakapo scent and lead its handler to a smaller , more slender and greener bird . Merton examined it and declared that the search for a female was over . Four other female kakapos , along with their nests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Merton 's jubilation would prove short-lived . After the first female was banded and released on Stewart Island , she disappeared . Soon after , researchers began finding kakapo carcasses . Within two years , the known population of adult kakapos on the island decreased by nearly 70 percent , probably due to feral cats . Again , the bird hovered on the brink of extinction . A new policy was called for . <p> Over a decade starting in 1982 , the 61 surviving Stewart Island kakapos were captured and transferred to Little Barrier , Maud and Codfish , three small , nearly predator-free island sanctuaries . <p> Then , in 1999 , on Maud Island , Merton discovered a nest containing three eggs . " We 've waited more than 20 years for this nest , " he said to his team . " It must succeed ! " The nest was perched on a slope so steep that researchers had to cut a winding staircase of 140 steps to reach it . <p> Along with scientist Graeme Elliott and team leader Paul Jansen , Merton organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flossie . Whenever she left the nest at night to forage , a team of researchers moved in . They constructed a three-foot-high wall to prevent any eggs from rolling downhill and a plywood roof over the nest . And they dug a drain above the nest to divert heavy rainwater away from it . Flossie 's movements in and out of the nest set off a door chime that alerted researchers to her comings and goings . A miniature video camera kept an electronic eye on the chicks . Under this intense scrutiny , several broods , totaling 12 chicks in all , grew up over three seasons , raising the overall kakapo population , which had seen several deaths since 1982 , to 62 birds . <p> There matters stood until 2001 , when researchers on Codfish Island noticed that the rimu trees there , sources of a nut ( encased in a fleshy aril ) that they believe somehow triggers kakapo breeding , appeared poised to deliver a bumper crop of fruit . In anticipation of the bounty , they airlifted 9 female kakapos from Maud Island to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be our moment of truth , " said Merton . <p> While the predictions of rimu plentitude proved accurate , the magnitude of the kakapo baby boom that resulted from it took even Merton by surprise . In 24 nests ( four of the females nested twice ) , the research team found a total of 67 eggs . Once the eggs hatched , researchers got another surprise . Each nestling was eating up to 1,000 rimu nuts every time it was fed , sometimes four times a night . The kakapo mother had to gather rimu nuts furiously , at the pace of some 16 every minute . " This is all the more remarkable , " Merton says , " if you remember that the kakapo is flightless , and that it gathers its food at night , high in the forest canopy . " During the eight-month period between conception and the time when their chicks leave the nest , kakapo mothers were losing as much as a third of their body weight . <p> By summer 's end , 24 new birds , including 15 females , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the kakapo have now turned the corner , " Merton told me . " They are on the way to recovery . " Still , he worried . <p> At a cost of about $500,000 per year , the Kakapo Recovery Programme is a major expense . If rescue and breeding efforts on the islands stopped for financial or political reasons , the bird would likely go the way of the dodo . To prevent that scenario , Merton and his colleagues hatched a plan to create a self-sustainable kakapo population on Campbell Island , which is located halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica . <p> Not only is this remote island predator-free and covered with fruiting plants that will provide plenty of food for the kakapos , but Campbell is also big enough , at nearly 44 square miles , to support a large and growing population . An indigenous snowgrass that has a fruit similar to the rimu should help satisfy the demanding nutritional needs of the chicks . The kakapos should adapt well to the cold there , because they have as much as a half-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his team and six kakapos , hopes to transport the birds to Campbell Island next year when the local plants are fruiting abundantly . A fixed-wing airplane equipped with emergency life rafts will accompany the helicopter containing researchers and kakapos on the nearly ten-hour round-trip flight to the island . <p> Is the kakapo worth all the fuss ? Merton answers by citing the Chatham Islands black robin , once the rarest bird in the world , but now thriving in a self-sustainable population . " We absolutely must do the same for the kakapo , create a place and a situation where they do n't need us anymore , " he says . " If we ca n't save the kakapo  --  our flagship species and number one conservation priority  --  what hope is there for all the other , less glamourous critters ? " Merton adds that he would be the happiest man alive if he were able to put himself out of a job . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " It hops like a sparrow and growls like a dog , " says an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of Don Merton . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Slow breeders , kakapos hatch chicks only once every three to five years , a trait similar to the extinct dodo . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Male kakapos ( like this one in Fiordland ) will cluster together and spread their wings in a courtship dance called lekking . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Kakapos eat many fruits but particularly enjoy rimu fruit , which seems to encourage breeding . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A recent baby boom on Codfish Island produced 24 chicks . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Nestlings receive regular checkups . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Derek Grzelewski <p> <p> Frequent contributor Derek Grzelewski writes from his home on the edge of Fiordland wilderness , a onetime kakapo stronghold . <p>
