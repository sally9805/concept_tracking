An Alameda County judge ruled Monday that the organization that oversees high school sports in California violated state law when it found a Placer County foster child ineligible to play football because of a paperwork mix-up by his school 's athletic director . <p> In her ruling , Superior Court Judge Judith Ford overturned the California Interscholastic Federation 's decision to disqualify Dalton Dyer from playing , and she ordered that five games his team at Placer High School in Auburn was forced to forfeit this autumn as a result of the organization 's decision be restored , putting Placer back in the playoffs with a 4-2 record . <p> Facing reporters after the hearing , a grinning Dyer said he felt " good " about the ruling . Asked if he was ready to play some football , he offered two more words : " Oh , yeah . " <p> Dyer 's coach , Joey Montoya , who sat beside his player throughout Monday 's hearing , was more talkative . <p> " We 're obviously happy with the decision , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood for what we believed was right , and it came out to be true today . " <p> At the center of the case were the federation 's rules and procedures for determining whether a student who transfers into a school - as Dyer did in August when he moved from a foster home in Vallejo to live with his aunt in Auburn - is eligible to play school sports . <p> The rules , which affect about 700,000 students statewide , are intended to prevent student athletes from being recruited by over-competitive coaches and similar abuses , according to the federation . <p> But the rules as they are written allow students who move into an area with their entire immediate family and all of their belongings to play sports immediately . Meanwhile , other students , which the federation said might include foreign exchange students or students moving from one parent 's home to another 's , as well as foster children , can compete only after their schools submit hardship-transfer paperwork . <p> Dyer was ruled ineligible to play in late October after it came to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his school 's athletic director . <p> Attorneys for the National Center for Youth Law , who represented Dyer , had argued that requiring the paperwork constituted treating foster children differently than other students and created a barrier to their participation in school activities , which they pointed out is expressly prohibited under California law . They suggested the federation should have interpreted its rules to hold that Dyer did move with his entire immediate family : himself . <p> " It 's fundamentally unfair to require foster youths to complete these processes that other youths will not have to complete , " Leecia Welch , an attorney for the youth law center , argued in court Monday . " They do n't have families . That 's why they 're in foster care . And that 's why we consider it appropriate for them to be considered families of one . " <p> Scott Donald , attorney for the Sac-Joaquin section of the federation that includes Placer High , called Welch 's cause " noble " but said the rules were designed to protect all student athletes . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather require more-stringent paperwork from all new transfers than lose the process altogether . <p> " A barrier is exactly what it says : You ca n't get in , " he told Ford . " Limiting eligibility until full eligibility , that 's not a barrier . It 's a requirement . " <p> Ford grilled both sides and then called an hourlong recess before ruling in Dyer 's favor and saying the federation 's application of its rules in his case violated state law . The judge promised to issue a written order today clarifying her decision . <p> Attorneys for the center for youth law said they expect her written decision to apply not just to Dyer but to similarly situated foster children who want to play high school sports . <p> " It was an issue of fairness , " said Welch . " We could n't be more happy with the ruling . " <p> Federation attorneys had no immediate comment after the hearing but later issued a statement saying the playoff game , originally scheduled for last Friday night between Colfax High School and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Oakdale . The Division IV championship game will be held Dec. 12 . <p> " While we strongly disagree with the decision , we respect the judge 's ruling and will move forward in accordance with it , " said Pete Saco , commissioner of the Sac-Joaquin section . " Longer term , we will be exploring our options , but for now we look forward to resuming and completing our ... football playoffs without any further distraction . " <p> Art Woodward , an attorney whose son plays on the Placer team and who represented the school pro bono in an earlier appeal of the federation 's decision , said Monday afternoon that his son and his teammates were elated . <p> Woodward has said he initially offered to look at the federation 's ruling against Placer just to see what could be done but became more passionate about the fight as he learned more about the day-to-day challenges faced by foster children such as Dyer . He said he hoped the ruling would pave the path to more participation in school sports by foster children . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County school that leapfrogged Placer High when Placer 's wins were disqualified , will not be in the playoffs this year . <p> It was a bitter pill for some young athletes who had been on a bus and partway to Oakdale Stanislaus County on Friday when a different Alameda County judge issued a temporary restraining order , calling a halt to the game until the question of Dyer 's ineligibility was settled . <p> Told Monday of the new ruling that bumped Colfax out of the playoffs , Jeff Tremoureux , father of Colfax player Thomas Tremoureux , 17 , was incredulous . <p> " You 're kidding me . Unbelievable . Those poor kids , I feel so sorry for them . It 's been on and off , on and off , on and off . What a cruddy way to end the season , " he said . " They 've been practicing for the last two weeks , and now I guess it was all for nothing . This thing should never have gotten to this level . " <p> Woodward said he sympathized . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the frustration . We truly tried to fix this problem before it became the kind of issue it became , " he said . <p> But he said the only alternative would have been to walk away from a situation he believed was wrong . <p> " I was n't going to do that , " he said . <p> But Oakdale Mustangs coach Trent Merzon , who on Sunday said he felt strongly that the CIF rules should be upheld in the interest of fairness and respect for rules , said he was glad in some way for the reversal . <p> " It would have been more frustrating , I think , to replay last week 's game against Colfax , " he said . " At least this was n't a waste of time - something came of it , there was some change . <p> " It 's football season again . " <p> " They do n't have families . That 's why they 're in foster care . And that 's why we consider it appropriate for them to be considered families of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
