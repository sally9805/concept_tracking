**** When Campagnolo surprised everyone last year by showing up at the fall trade shows with 10-speed cassettes , the prevailing thought was , " Cool . But do we really need 10 cogs ? " The answer , of course , is " No . " But after riding a 10-speed Chorus group for nearly a year we asked ourselves , " is having 10 cogs a benefit ? " The answer is yes . Chorus ( and the higher-end Record ) 10-speed cassettes come in 11-23,1225,13-26 and 13-29 , with Record offering an additional 11-21 cogset If you 're a racer , it means you get Mouth jumps between almost every cog , which lets you ride at your optimal cadence nearly all the time . If you 're a regular old cyclist like most of us , the chief benefit is a wide-ratio cogset that gives you more hillclimbing ability without the gargantuan jumps between gears you normally experience with an 8- or 9-speed cluster . Plus : Every cassette combination includes a 16-tooth sprocket , which we count as the single most useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chainring combos . It 's impressive , especially when you consider those 10 cogs are packed onto a rear axle measuring only 130 mm between locknuts ( a space originally designed for just 8 sprockets ) . Campy accomplishes this magic feat by thinning the chain from 69 to 6.1 mm , most of the diminution coming from the use of flush-riveted pins instead of the usual protruding link pins . The cogs are 0.1 mm thinner at the sharp end ( although the cogs themselves are the same thickness as 9-speed otherwise , with thinner spacers to cram them onto the cassette body ) , and the outer chainring is modified as well . The derailleurs , shifters , brakes , headset hubs , cassette , chain , crank and bottom bracket Up the scale at 3,045 grams  --  just 151 grams more than Record , and smack between rival Shimano 's Dure-Ace and Ultegra component weights . Most of the weight difference between Campy 's 10-speed and 9-speed groups comes from the rear derailleur ( 18 grams ) and chain ( 21 grams ) , which offsets the added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chorus lighter than its 9-speed counterpart . Other 2000 changes to Chorus : an oversize front hub with an alloy axle that 's basically the Record hub without the grease port , saving 28 grams over the ' 99 version . There 's a new seatpost , and the rear derailleur is new , weighing just 209 grams , 34 grams less than the ' 99 . Functionally , the 10-speed stuff has a quicker-feeling action . You can shift the rear under high-torque , low-rpm loads without inducing tooth-popping chain noises . The shifter action is light and positive , and you can slam through the cassette about as fast as a Formula 1 car runs through its gearbox . Now consider this : 10-speed Chorus retails for $400 less than Record 9-speed , and $500 less than Record with 10 cogs . Unless you 're a sponsored pro who 's logging 30,000 miles a year , a millionaire who whe loves bikes and has to have Record or a pure Campy nut , Chorus is the group to own . Maybe it does n't have Record 's cachet-but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes good sense to us . Campagnolo , 760/931-0106 ; www.campagnolo.corn - Garrett Lai <p>
