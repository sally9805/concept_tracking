<p> Mary Kwan has spent a lot of her career in mid-tier department stores , where vacuum cleaners and barbecues share fluorescent lighting with pearl necklaces and baby blankets . <p> Now a Levi Strauss &; Co. vice president , she 's standing with the famous denim brand on the front stoop of Wal-Mart . <p> Wal-Mart dominates the big-box discounters that have taken billions of dollars in sales from department stores . And after years of stocking department stores with clothing for children and adults , Kwan these days is focused on knowing who shops for jeans at Wal-Mart . <p> She also wants to know who does n't shop Wal-Mart but might be persuaded to  --  if they heard that the world 's largest retailer soon will carry the Levi Strauss name . <p> Wal-Mart holds a big swatch of hope for the 149-year-old denim giant . <p> The $4.3 billion , privately held San Francisco firm  --  whose revenues topped $7 billion five years ago before they started sinking  --  hopes to grow again in part by putting its name in front of mass-discount shoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 , fits in . Levi 's newest executive , she oversees the development and marketing of the Levi Strauss Signature brand , the third leg on the company 's branding stool that also includes Levi 's and Dockers . <p> When it hits stores next year , Levi Strauss Signature will lower the bottom rung on Levi 's ladder with basic jeans priced between $23 and $26 . Levi 's typically sell for $30 or more in department stores , and some top $200 in high-end specialty stores such as Barneys New York . <p> Wal-Mart plans to introduce Levi 's lower-budget Signature line of tops , denim , casual pants and jackets next year in time for the back-to-school rush . <p> The new brand also could end up in other discount chains , but Levi has n't released any deals yet . <p> " We know a lot of consumers who shop in the mass channel do not buy apparel , " Kwan said . Among those who do , she added , " a lot of them do n't buy jeans . I think there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in Hong Kong and is the second-oldest of seven siblings , moved to the United States for college largely at her parents ' behest . <p> Her parents were upper-middle class and sold antiques and fine jewelry in three shops that they owned . It 's there , during summer breaks from high school , that Kwan got her earliest retail training , helping her poised and meticulous mother string cultured pearls and arrange diamonds in settings . " That 's partly how I became who I am and how I 'm wired , " Kwan said . <p> At the same time , her parents did not encourage their children to plan for an adulthood in Hong Kong . " When I was 10 or 12 , they told me that when I graduate from high school , I had to pick a free country and leave home , " she said . " They said , ' Get on a boat or a plane and create a fortune . . . . Explore your future . ' " <p> She did just that , earning a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a merchandising resume at J.C . Penney , Sears , Mervyn 's and Lane Bryant . Just before joining Levi , Kwan spent nine months with San Diego discounter Factory 2-U before she left to be near her ailing mother in San Francisco , she said . <p> A few weeks later , Kwan moved into an office at Levi headquarters on Battery Street . <p> A public announcement about Levi 's long-rumored alliance with Wal-Mart was still four months away . When Kwan arrived , the Signature brand-development team numbered a dozen . Now it 's 50 strong and growing . <p> The opportunities and risks in Levi 's new endeavor are huge . Wal-Mart , with about 3,000 stores and 200 or more on the drawing board in the coming year , operates on an unrivaled scale of volume and efficiency . <p> Wal-Mart poses a major test for Levi Strauss ' overseas production and its sometimes-spotty store-delivery system , which has been criticized as lagging behind competitors such as VF Corp . VF makes Wrangler and Rustler jeans , including styles Wal-Mart already carries . <p> Levi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet Wal-Mart 's strict demands for delivery and cost controls . <p> Kwan said the challenges are partly what drew her to the job : The Levi Strauss Signature brand has to walk a fine line  --  attracting shoppers drawn to the company name without cannibalizing Levi 's core department-store sales . <p> " The quality standard is no different , " Kwan said . She added that the denim used in the Levi Strauss Signature jeans will tend to be lighter weight  --  translating to lower material costs . A $50-or-higher pair of department-store jeans requiring 90 minutes of fabric-sanding for a desired effect will receive less sanding time  --  and possibly machine attention instead of hand sanding  --  in order to meet the cost-cutting standards dictated by Wal-Mart . <p> " Our engineers are brilliant , " Kwan said . " How do you replicate that look , but in less time ? " <p> That question is familiar to Kwan from her merchandising days at moderate department stores . " It has always intrigued me . How do I develop this ( piece of clothing ) so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been inspiring to me . " <p> Kwan reports directly to Robert Hanson , Levi 's U.S. brand president , who said her history as a customer of Levi Strauss  --  as a buyer for Sears , Mervyn 's and J.C . Penney  --  gives her insight into the jeansmaker 's operations . <p> At Lane Bryant , Hanson said , Kwan helped bring modern , sexy fashions to customers who had been primarily relegated to clothing that covered  --  but did n't necessarily flatter  --  their larger figures . <p> " She really talked to , understood these women and realized that plus-sized women are like anybody else : The most important thing they want is respect for who they are , " Hanson said . <p> In a way , Levi executives have said , discount-store shoppers are looking for the same kind of respect from apparel-makers . <p> After four years , Kwan left Lane Bryant , in 2001 , just before the Limited sold it to retail store operator Charming Shoppes . Financially , Lane Bryant continues to struggle , though the brand enjoys wide name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at J.C . Penney and Mervyn 's , from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s , those stores were considered discount stores more than they were the moderate department stores they are today , said Harry Bernard , partner in independent San Francisco apparel consulting firm Colton Bernard Inc. and a longtime Levi-watcher . <p> J.C . Penney , Sears and Mervyn 's are still key retail customers for Levi Strauss , and Levi is counting on Kwan to understand how they think , too . <p> At the same time , her eye has to be trained on the many shoppers who have ditched department stores and turned instead to discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target . <p> As Bernard put it , " Now she is going to take that expertise and go directly into the ( department-store ) competition , the No. 1 discounter in the world .
