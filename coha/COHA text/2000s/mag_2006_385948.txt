SCOUTS VIEWS STEELERS I do n't think Mines Ward gets enough credit . Great , I think , is used too often in this league . But he certainly is deserving of that label . ... You do n't want to put Ben Roethllsberger in the upper echelon of quarterbacks , but the guy continues to make plays . It can be a tight situation and he 'll scramble or roll out , break a tackle and hit somebody downfield .... Heath Miller is going to emerge as one of the better complete tight ends . BENGALS I think Carson Palmer will return to form and be even better . From a physical standpoint , I think he 'll be stronger . It 's just a matter of getting over that injury from a mental standpoint .... I like the running combination of Rudi Johnson and Chris Perry . Rudi 's got good vision and hits the hole with power . Perry brings some versatility in that he can run inside or outside as well catch the ball . ... What they 'll miss with Odell Thurman not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered up by better defensive line play . RAVENS As far as experience , understanding the offense , accuracy , arm strength and mobility , Steve McNaIr still has all those things . The only question is if he can stay healthy for 16 games . ... Jonathan Ogden is still a good pass blocker , but he 's not the run blocker he used to be . He 's still one of the top 10 left tackles in the league , but I would n't put him in Walter Jones ' class anymore . BROWNS I think Charlie Frye is going to be pretty good . He 's not going to wow you with his arm , but he 's got that intangible of not being overwhelmed by the situation and being able to create things .... Willie McGinest was a huge pickup . He 's going to bring a pass-rush presence and also that experience and championship mentality Romeo Crennel wants to have in Cleveland . Ward is a star , but for some reason , he is n't always called one . Predicted finish : 1 Steelers 13-3* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh STEELERS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : With 19 starters returning-including all of the core players from last season 's championship team-and no disruptions to the coaching staff , the Steelers do n't have any significant weaknesses . QB Ben Roethlisberger appears to be recovered from his offseason motorcycle accident and , in his third season , will only get better . He proved in the playoffs he can win games with his arm . With Roethlisberger at the controls , the Steelers have the league 's most balanced , diverse and efficient offense . Roethlisberger can throw deep to WR Cedrlck Wilson and rookie WR Santonlo Holmes and over the middle to WR Nines Ward and TE Heath Miller . And do n't forget RB Willie Parker , a breakaway threat whose 4.7 yards per carry ranked second in the AFC among 1,000-yard rushers last season . The defense is deep in the secondary and is led by SS Troy Polamalu , who arguably is the best defensive player in the league . NT Casey Hampton is almost immovable , and OLB Joey Porter was the team 's most disruptive defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Cowher is working hard to keep the team from becoming complacent . He has reminded the players they were n't necessarily the best team in 2005 but merely the best at the right moment . Obviously , a major injury to Roethlisberger would be a big hit He brings so many intangibles to the position that quantifying his importance is almost impossible . Charlie Batch is a good backup , but he has a history of injuries and ca n't be relied upon to stay healthy for an extended stretch . The team will miss retired RB Jerome Bettls ' powerful running in short-yardage situations , but it will miss him even more in the locker room . RB Duce Staley will replace Bettis on the field and likely will be more productive , but the team will need to find another emotional leader . DULAC 'S BOTTOM LINE : As long as Roethlisberger stays healthy , the Steelers will be potent on offense because they can run and throw equally well . Couple that with an attacking defense and the ingredients are there for the Steelers to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - Gerry Dulac STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Hines Ward 5 LT Marvel Smith 4 LG Alan Faneca 5 C Jeff Hartinqs S RG Kendall Simmons 2 RT Max Starks 3 TE Heath Miller 4 WR Cedrick Wilson 2 QB Ben Roethlisberger 5 FB Dan Kreider 4 RB Willie Parker 3 DEFENSE LE Aaron Smith 4 NT Casey Hampton 5 RE Brett Keisel 3 OLB Joey Porter 5 ILB Larry Foote 3 ILB James Farrior 4 OLB Clark Haggans 4 CB Ike Taylor 4 CB Deshea Townsend 3 SS Troy Polamalu 5 FS Ryan Clark 3 SPECIALISTS K Jeff Reed 4 P Chris Gardocki 2 KR Santonio Holmes 2 PR Willie Reid 3 LS Greg Warren 2 Players rated 1-5 , with 5 highest SNAPSHOT with ILB LarryFoote Beware of these guys In the locker room : You have to watch out for the kickers because they 're always playing soccer.The ball will hit you in the head .

If the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is winning , he always picks them . Funniest trash-talker : Joey Porter . He talks about your mother , your grandmother , your kids-he 's just crazy . Can't-mlss weekly dining tradition : For away games , we get Popeyes chicken the Saturday morning before we fly out . That 's the best part . Player I most hate to play against : Probably Tom Brady . We have a hard time beating him . Nobody knows this about Heinz Field : As you enter the stadium on game day , you 'll see at least five fights before the game . That 's Steelers fans fighting each other or the other team 's fans . Most wired : You know it 's coach Cowher , but for a teammate , probably Clark Haggans energywise . Huddle moment : The San Diego game last year . We were about to fight with each other . Everyone was screaming at each other and the officials . It was funny , looking back , because everyone was arguing . 2 Cincinnati BENGALS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : Barring a setback , QB Carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months after reconstructive surgery on his left knee . Palmer is the perfect strong-armed leader for an offense that returns 11 starters and can hurt opponents with a quick-strike passing game or a bruising running attack . Bookend OTs Levi Jones and WIIMe Anderson anchor a deep , talented line that will be under pressure to protect Palmer , whose health will be a seasonlong worry.The improving defense led the NFL with 44 takeaways last season and has plugged gaping holes with DT Sam Adams and SS Dexter Jackson . The team expects Adams and Jackson to help solidify the run defense , which would allow DEs Bryan Robinson , Justin Smith and Robert Geathers to generate more sacks in nickel packages . KR Tab Perry and PR Antonio Chatman are dangerous because of their speed and quickness . More speed has been added to the coverage units , so the special teams likely will be a strength . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Backup QB Anthony Wright has more mobility than Palmer , but he lacks the arm strength to run the full playbook . Adams reported to camp out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lack of preseason snaps has caused chemistry and timing issues on the defensive line . OLB David Pollack is being counted on to have a breakout year , but a pulled hamstring has impeded his progress and questions remain about whether he and OLB Landen Johnson can contain the outside . MLB Odell Thurman 's four-game suspension for violating the NFL 's substance-abuse policy is a big setback . He was too aggressive at times as a rookie but also was the club 's most explosive defender . LUDWIG 'S BOTTOM LINE : With Palmer coming off major knee surgery and the team facing a challenging schedule , it 's unrealistic to expect another AFC North crown . Still , the continuity on offense and upgrades on defense will allow the club to contend for a wild-card berth . - Chick Ludwig STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Chad Johnson 5 LT Levi Jones 4 LG Eric Steinbach 4 C Rich Braharn 3 RG Bobbie Williams 4 RT Willie Anderson 5 TE Reggie Kelly 2 WR T.J.

I would n't mind playing him early in the year . But later in the season , when he 's in shape , he 's one of those guys you hate to play against . He 's just a big , strong , mean , evil man . Weirdest pregame ritual : Deltha O'Neal gets about 50 towels out of the restroom , then lays them in front of his locker . He just kind of sits on them and lays on them and does the Deltha O'Neal thing . He wastes a lot of towels every week .

And you know you need him , so you do n't want to kill him . Cheapest teammate : Without a doubt , Justin Smith . Justin is El Cheapo . He 's always talking about making money and different things he 's got going on , but Justin 's not the type who will pick up a tab . 3 Baltimore RAVENS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : . The Ravens added QB Steve McNair during the offseason . Despite being prone to injury the past couple of years , he provides stability and much-needed confidence at the position . If McNair is standing at the end of the season , the Ravens might get to the postseason . They finally have a quarterback who can make plays at crunch time.The team chemistry , which was bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bisciotti ordered coach Brian Billick to stop being so arrogant and condescending and to establish relationships with the players . The Ravens signed FS Ed Reed and RB Jamal Lewis to new contracts . Money issues long have been a source of contention in the locker room . With these issues behind them , the Ravens will have more harmony . REASONS FOR CONCERN : The offensive line performed poorly last season , but the front office brought back the entire group . LG Edwin Mulltalo and LT Jonathan Ogden worked out extensively in the offseason , which will help , but their performances have dropped off in recent years . Much improvement is needed on the right side . If G Keydrick Vincent and T Tony Pashos , plus C Mike Flynn , can protect McNair , the offense will have success . The club lost free-agent DE Anthony Weaver and DT Maake Kemoeatu . They were n't spectacular players , but they were solid . Weaver was replaced by Trevor Pryce , who could be on the downside of his career . It will take time to groom DT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to keep linemen off MLB Ray Lewis . PRESTON 'S BOTTOM LINE : McNair has to stay healthy for the team to have a chance.The Ravens will be competitive only if they avoid injuries . The team may have waited too long to bring in a quarterback like McNair . It gambled on the development of QB Kyle Boiler , and the window for a title closed significantly when he was a starter . - Mike Preston STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Derrick Mason 4 LT Jonathan Ogden 5 LG Edwin Mulitalo 3 C Mike Flynn 3 RG Keydrick Vincent 2 RT Tony Pashos 2 TE Todd Heap 5 WR Mark Clayton 3 QB Steve McNair 3 FB Justin Green 2 RB Jamal Lewis 3 DEFENSE LE Trevor Pryce 2 DT Haloti Ngata 2 DT Kelly Gregg 3 RE Terrell Suggs 4 OLB Adalius Thomas 4 MLB Ray Lewis 4 OLB Bart Scott 3 CB Chris McAlister 3 CB Samari Rolle 3 SS Dawan Landry 1 FS Ed Reed 5 SPECIALISTS K Matt Stover 4 P Leo Araguz 2 KR B.J.

Cheapest teammate : Jason Brown . If you invite him anywhere , the first thing he is going to ask you is if there is free food or free drinks . After him , it would be Jonathan Ogden , My body on Monday morning : It 's like a steel rod . It takes me 4 or 5 minutes to get out of bed . You just kind of sit up , move things around to see what still works and what does n't . Then it 's , " Damn , where did that come from ? " Beware of this guy in the locker room : Me . Most times I 'm returning it because if someone does something to me , I have to make it so bad that no one will want to mess with me in the future . And if you knew about it , I 'm going to get you , too . Can't-miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries . Funniest trash-talker : We call Bart Scott " the Mad " Backer . " He gets to arguing and fighting with someone almost every single game and is always close to getting kicked out of games . Coach Billick is yelling and screaming everything at him , but it really does n't matter . 4 Cleveland BROWNS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : The beleaguered Browns can hang their orange helmets on Romeo Crennel 's leadership . He steadily has built confidence while tweaking the structure of the organization . Coordinator Todd Grantham figures to take the defense from respectable to good because the team signed NT Ted Washington and OLB Willie McGinest and drafted OLB Kamerion Wimbley and ILB D'Qwell Jackson . All figure to start , and all are good fits in the 3-4 . The receiving trio of WRs Braylon Edwards and Joe Jurevicius and TE Kellen Winslow could be impressive if Edwards and Winslow come back strong from knee surgeries . Jurevicius is a big target who figures to solve some of the team 's red zone problems . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Maurice Carthon did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He needs to be more creative to keep teams from focusing on RB Reuben Droughns . QB Charlie Frye is resourceful but needs to be more accurate . There will be pressure on Frye to do more than just manage the game . If he fails , the team wo n't hesitate to look for a new No. 1 QB . Center was supposed to be a strength , but LeCharles Bentley was lost for the season . The Browns will try to get by at the position with journeymen Ross Tucker and Lennle Frledman.The pass rush needs to improve because there are serious issues in the secondary . No. 1 CB Gary Baxter ( strained pectoral ) and nickel back Daylon McCutcheon ( knee ) missed most of the preseason.The front seven looks strong , but that could change quickly if Washington and McGinest wear down . DOERSCHUK 'S BOTTOM LINE : If Crennel somehow improves the team from 6-10 to 7-9 , he will prove he is a capable coach . The defense will keep the team in games and could carry it to a respectable record with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have too many issues to avoid more dog days for the Dawg Pound . - Steve Doerschuk STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Braylon Edward 3 LT Kevin Shaffer 4 LG Joe Andruzzi C Ross Tucker RG Cosey Coleman 3 RT Ryan Tucker 4 TE Kellen Winslow 3 WR Joe Jurevicius 3 QB Charlie Frye 2 FB Terrelle Smith 4 RB Reuben Droughns 3 DEFENSE LE Orpheus Roye 4 NT Ted Washington 4 RE Alvin McKinley 3 OLB Willie McGinest 4 ILB Andra Davis 4 ILB D'Qwell Jackson 3 OLB Kamerion Wimbley 3 Leigh Bodden 3 CB Gary Baxter 3 SS Sean Jones 3 FS Brian Russell 3 SPECIALISTS K Phil Dawson 4 P Dave Zastudil 4 KR Josh Cribbs 4 PR Dennis Northcutt 4 LS Ryan Pontbriand 4 Prayers rated 1-5 , with 5 highest SNAPSHOT with CB Gary Baxter Beware of this guy in the locker room : Probably big Ted Washington .

Cheapest teammate : Sean Jones , definitely . I mean , he forgets that he 's a second-round pick . He swears he 's dead broke . Bet you did n't know this about Romeo Crennel : Me looks cool and calm on the sideline , but you do n't want to push his buttons because he can turn very vicious . He can be a different person .
