Outed CIA agent Valerie Plame says Dick Cheney ruined her career  --  and she wants him to pay . Plame and her husband Joseph Wilson filed suit last week against the Veep , Karl Rove , I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby and other officials . Here 's our brief : <P> Why sue ? Plame and Wilson , an ex-diplomat , allege a " conspiracy " among top White House officials to punish them after Wilson exposed flaws in pre-Iraq-war intelligence . They say exposing Plame as a CIA agent jeopardized their safety and invaded their privacy . <P> Privacy ? They posed for Vanity Fair . Their embrace of the limelight could hurt them . But before columnist Robert Novak ran Plame 's name , citing White House sources , she was unknown . Said her lawyer Christopher Wolf : " She was dragged into the public square . " <P> What do they want ? Compensation and punitive damages . Plame also wants Administration officials to be held responsible for " shameful conduct . " Cynical observers note Plame has a book deal to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican lawyer familiar with the defense , " to have their names front and center . " <P> Why now ? Concerned about the statute of limitations , the pair filed the suit a day before the third anniversary of Novak 's Plame column . <P> Could they win ? Federal officials are immune to most suits for actions that are within their duties  --  and a G.O.P. lawyer says Cheney , Rove and Libby were " government employees simply engaged in rebutting allegations . " But constitutional expert Erwin Chemerinsky , who 's on the Plame-Wilson legal team , is confident : " The evidence is clear that the defendants abused their power . " The case could be put on hold until after Libby 's prosecution for perjury in connection with the case . In any event , it 's likely to cost the defendants thousands in legal fees  --  and devour energies at the White House . <P> Could new information emerge on the leak ? If the suit moves forward , the discovery process could reveal previously unseen  --  and potentially embarrassing  --  White House memos.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
