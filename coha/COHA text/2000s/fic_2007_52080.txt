Like Lawrence Connolly and the narrator of " Stars Seen Through Stone , " P. E. Cunningham lives in **25;3744;TOOLONG , in the heart of Dutch Country . She notes that her town now has its very own Wal-Mart store , complete with a buggy parking area so the Amish can shop there . Perhaps it was thoughts of modern modes of transportation that inspired this tale , which mixes old-fashioned sentiments with high speed dangers to make for a mighty good read . <p> OFFICER WILL JAMISON HAD been gone for a week before I dropped by Simpson 's Garage . I had n't thought anything of itat the time , but when Joel 's girl Brandi mentioned what was going on , it jolted me out of my own grief and got me moving . Half the town had turned out for Officer Will 's funeral , but the most deserving mourner had n't been there , and nothing short of Cod 's will would have kept her away . She must have been hurting awful bad , more than anyone knew . Some things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stake . I ambled in like an old-timer , after a glance out back . Haberville Borough had a contract with Simpson 's Garage . His crew patched up the cop cars that got banged up or shot at or threw a rod or whatnot . The fixed-up ones sat in a line by the fence , all shined up and ready to rock . It was n't until you got out back that you spotted the rest : the burned-out , beat-up junkers , up on blocks or on flat tires , some with hoods and doors torn off , some crumpled up like Kleenex , tossed out like a fridge on a trash heap . Car 17 was n't out there yet . I took that as a good sign . Joel was bent over a bench in the center bay , tinkering with a carb . A pickup sat with its hood up , like it fell asleep with its mouth open . Joel used to pal around with my older brother in high school , that 's how I knew him . He took the mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean marriage-serious . He needed this job , and I did n't want him losing it over some dumbass kid with a weirdass theory . But I owed it to Officer Will . " Hey , Joel , " I said , and waved . He flicked a glance my way . " Oh , hey , Chuck . What brings you by ? " " Heard you 're having trouble with Officer Will 's old car . " " Yeah . It ai n't run at all since the shooting . I thought maybe a bullet hit the gas line or nicked something , but I ca n't find anything . " " Y'mind if I have a look at her ? " He squinted over the carb at me . " Since when are you a mechanic ? " " I know some stuff about cars , " I lied . " Thought maybe I could help out . " " You know you ai n't supposed to be here , right ? You could get us both in trouble . " " C'm on . We all liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get junked . Just let me see her . Somebody comes in , I 'll scram . You can say you never saw me . For Officer Will , man . " Joel chewed on his lip . I think my mentioning Officer Will got to him . He and Car 17 were the closest thing we 'd ever had to a legend . " Yeah , okay , " he said finally . " Guess it could n't hurt to have a fresh eye look at it . " He pointed the carb at me . " But anyone shows up , you 're gone . Got it ? " I promised to stay invisible . Joel took me outside and led me around the corner . They 'd towed 17 to the garage after the shooting , and worked on her for hours at a stretch . But days of mechanicking turned up zilch . Then there were other vehicles with stalled engines and blown gaskets and burnt wires , real fixable stuff , and 17 was taking up a bay . So they rolled her out back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but right on the edge . " Y'need anything ? " Joel asked , skeptical-like . " Just some tools . I may have to get under her . " Joel shrugged and trudged back inside . Meanwhile I just stood there and eyed Will 's car . She was a Chevy Impala , like most of the cruisers they had back then . Today Haberville uses Ford Crown Vies , but back then it was Chevy all the way . I popped the hood and poked around so I 'd look like I was doing something useful . Couple minutes later Joel returned , toting a creeper and toolbox . " I never saw anything wrong in there , " he said . " How about you ? " I can change my own oil and that 's about it . " I do n't think it 's in here , " I said . " I have an idea , though , but I 'll have to root around a little . It could take some time . " " It 's gon na take until five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed me . " When I leave , you leave . No argument . " Two , three hours . Maybe enough . " Okay . I 'll see what I can do . " " Yeah . " Joel pursed his lips at the cruiser . " Be nice if you could do something . I always liked this car . It always ran real sweet . " " Yeah . I know . " " Yeah ? Where were you , front seat or back ? " He laughed and punched my arm , like he did when I was twelve , but nowhere near rough enough to hurt . " I 'll come get you when I 'm ready . Try not to break anything . " " Thanks . " I waited till he went back in the garage , then climbed onto the creeper and rolled myself underneath . I left the hood up and the toolbox open and took a spanner with me . All camouflage . I was n't planning on doing any real work . I just did n't want anybody to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today Haberville 's pretty built up - we got expensive housing developments and our own Target and everything - but way back when , we were still right on the edge of rural . We had a feed store in town , and an old played-out quarry out on Wanner Road where we were n't supposed to hang out but everybody did . We were n't big enough to rate two cops in a patrol car , but then , crime in Haberville was mostly of the speeders and Saturday-night drunks variety . Maybe a knife fight now and then , to liven things up a bit . Will Jamison grew up on my block . By the time I was eleven , when it all happened , he was already a cop . He 'd come home to Sunday dinner with his ma every weekend he was n't on duty , then take a stroll around the neighborhood , riding us kids for stupid stuff like , " Your shoe 's untied , that 's a misdemeanor " and we 'd jeer back with , " Hey , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on visits home ) and we 'd all laugh and he 'd tell us stories about what cops did and that . Those were good times . Will had a funny streak too . I mean ha-ha funny , not weird funny . But you had to wonder sometimes . A lot of the stories he told us were just plain piles of BS . Like that yarn he spun about how he got Car 17 . According to him , cop cars did n't come off the lot ; they ran wild , in herds , and you had to rope and ride your own and break it like a bronc . Like the Texas Rangers , he told the littler , gullible kids . You and your horse are buddies and ride the range together , looking for outlaws . We use cars now , not horses , but it 's the same thing . But that was n't all , he went on . You want a car that wo n't break down or quit on you in the middle of a high-speed chase , or when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust your life to . So I put a spell on mine , he said . He related how after he brought 17 in off the range , he soaped her up and hosed her down in an empty parking lot under a full October moon , to wash all the bad stuff out of her , then rubbed on two coats of wax , to seal the good stuff in . Then he put his hands on the borough seal they 'd put on her driver 's side door , and spoke the magic words of the police department : to protect and to serve . And that was that , he wrapped it up . She was mine after that . Why , if we did n't lock her in the garage , she 'd follow me around like a puppy and wag her trunk like a tail . Even the littler kids were n't dumb enough to swallow that . " Yeah , that 's a ripe one , " my brother used to say while holding his nose . We all held our noses for that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest , not so much then , but later on . It sure helped explain a lot of things . Officer Will never had a serious girl that we knew of , but he loved cars from the time he could push hot Wheels across the kitchen floor . Car 17 was his baby . He treated her like a princess , kept the oil changed and the engine tuned and slipped her special at the pump when the cops were supposed to use regular . " He 'd take it to bed with him if it 'd fit , " his mother used to complain . But he 'd been that way with the beat-up Ford he 'd rescued and rebuilt back when he was a kid . It 's how he was with cars . And the car paid him back . We started hearing stories around - not Officer 's Will 's tall tales , but stuff from other people , some of " em cops . The kind that make you shake your head and go nah or yeah , now pull the other one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy ran a stop sign , and when the cops tried to pull him over he took off . Got up on the highway and ran it all the way up to one hundred and fifty , with Officer Will right on his tail . " I did n't know our cars could go that fast , " some other cop said later . The chase ended when 17 tapped the speeder from behind and sent it into a spin . The car ran off the road and rolled . Turns out the driver , who was n't hurt , had a couple pounds of pot in his trunk . That back-end tap is a neat maneuver , we all seen it used on Top Cop Videos . We wanted to know where Officer Will learned it . " I did n't , " he said , in his version of the story . " She just kind of got away from me . The thrill of the chase , you know . " Then there was that other story , the one people wondered and whispered about . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us seen it . Officer Will would n't tell that one . I think it scared him a little . I know it scared the crap out of me . But love and duty are kinda scary , when you stop to think about it . IT STARTED WITH a hit and run on Falmouth Street , out at the edge of town . Some drunk wobbling along the berm near Mosley 's Bar got himself mowed down . At least , the cops reported , that 's what the tire tracks said , " cause nobody witnessed anything . A couple of guys in the bar thought maybe they remembered hearing a car engine around the time the guy got hit , but that was all . No squeal of brakes , no thump . The cops found flecks of green paint on the guy , and put out a call to local garages to let " em know if somebody brought in a dented green car , but nothing came of it . Then some kids out partying in Sell 's Park said some nutcase came after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One kid got clipped and had some bad bruises , but otherwise he was okay . A cop , not Officer Will , passed by right then , and the other car took off . The kids said the car might 've been green , but it 's tough to tell when it 's going on midnight and you 've been knocking back beers for the last couple hours . Somebody remembered a big dent in the passenger-side door , but nobody saw the driver clear . It was like the car did n't have a driver . This prompted recollections of Officer Will 's best ghost stories , about rogue cars that prowled the streets hunting pedestrians . These were cars that had been in hit-and-runs and caught a taste for blood . They 'd slip out of their owners " driveways at night and go roaming around for victims . Or the wild cars , the would-be cop cars that never got caught , that would creep into town and attack people , like man-eating tigers . To stop them , you had to cut their gas lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come back . The little kids passed these stories around like baseball cards , but I was going on twelve by then and did n't buy it no more . Not all that much , anyway . Then the green car ran down an old lady in the street , right in the middle of the afternoon , and it stopped being funny real quick . This was right by the grocerette , so there were plenty of witnesses . By all accounts , the car had been parked at the curb with nobody near it , and did n't make a move until the old lady started crossing the street . People said it was the squeal of the tires that turned their heads around . That green car peeled away from the curb and went at her at top speed , they said . No swerves , no brakes . Hit her head on , ran over her and lit out . No accident . Just pure and simple murder . Of course people looked for a license number . We 've all been trained by TV cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no plates . Nobody could even remember if it was a two-door or a four-door . Nobody got a look at the driver , either . In fact , nobody could remember seeing a driver . Not even hands on the wheel . Speculation flew all over town like crows at a dump heap . Some crazy kid . Some psycho guy . Some twisto who 'd seen too many movies . Some high school science geek who 'd rigged a car so he could steer it by remote control and now was out for revenge . That did n't explain the victims , " cause there was n't any connection , but the cops still took it all down . The little kids , of course , decided it had to be one of Officer Will 's wild cars that 'd gone bad and was out killing people , and they begged Officer Will to hunt it down and catch it . " We 're all on the case , " he reassured us , and he was n't kidding around . Haberville had about nine-ten cops back then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene of the crime . This was n't some drunk or druggie weaving his car around the roads anymore . This was deliberate murder . You do n't commit murder in Haberville , not with our cops on the job . Officer Will got to the grocerette within an hour of the first report . He parked 17 across the street from where the green car had been sitting and checked in with the ranking officer . The duty cops still milled around and warned people to go on home , folks , show 's over . The old lady had already been carted off in an ambulance . That did n't stop people like me and the other kids from hanging around to see what was up . Not that much was left , just a few oil stains on the tar by the curb , and some other stains , that were n't oil , in the middle of the street . The duty cops questioned witnesses and jotted down notes , while the others , like Officer Will , listened in but did n't interfere . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lookie-loos they went back to their cruisers . " Hey , " one of the duty officers called to Officer Will . " Get your car off the crime scene . " " What are you talking about ? " Will said . " She 's clear . I put her right over - " He pointed to the empty curb . Empty because 17 was n't there anymore . While the cops were grilling people she 'd slipped out of park and rolled across the street . I do n't remember seeing her move ; I 'd been watching the cops work , like everybody else . But there she was , with her back end sticking out in the street . Her front end sat right over the oil stains left by the green car . Like she was trying to pick up the scent . Officer Will got in and moved her , and the cops scraped up samples and did what they could , but without a better description than " green car " or a license plate number , what they could do did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a reward of $1,000 for anybody who could tell them who owned the green car . Officer Will asked us kids to keep our eyes open and come straight to the cops if we saw anything . And no more playing in the street . A couple of us did prowl around town , giving the squint to any car that had even a speck of green on it . Part of it was to help out Officer Will , but - yeah , I admit it - a lot of it was the reward . A thousand bucks is like all the money in the world when you 're ten or eleven . And it was summer , and we were out of school . What else was there to do ? So we rode our bikes for hours on end , and went places we probably shouldn't 've , and bugged the bejesus out of the grownups and phoned in all sons of tips . Like Danny Feinberg , who turned in his brother 's girlfriend 's cousin " cause the guy had a green VW . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sure what kind of car we were looking for , just that it was green and maybe had a dent in the door . But nobody turned up squat . None of the tips panned out , and nobody got the reward . I heard through my brother , who heard through Joel , that " the cops were working with the DMV and checking up on anybody who owned a green car of any year , make or model . The auto body places swore up and down they had n't worked on any green cars , or repainted any to some other color . Some sicko from out of town , was Dad 's opinion . Some asshole passing through . Probably in Nevada by now , running down people on the Vegas strip , or headed for southern California to join the rest of the crazies . Funny about the driver . Nobody remembered seeing anyone behind the wheel . I guess when a car 's bearing down on you all you can see is the grill . The driver kinda gets crowded out of your memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a Mafia car or a spy car . That started a whole other line of rumors , like the mob was trying to move into Haberville and these were all hits . What a drunk and some high school kids and an old lady buying bananas had to do with the mob , nobody had a real answer for . So we went on looking for a dented green car . You figure if you find the car , the driver will have to turn up . Things stayed quiet for almost two weeks . The big rush of leads petered out , and people stopped jumping every time some jerk revved his engine . We figured maybe Dad 'd been right , it was just an asshole passing through . Then the car attacked again , and this time it went for a kid . Little Andy Klosky . I knew him . His brother Mike and I played softball . Mike and his buddy Ed went out to the quarry on Wanner Road to sneak smokes , and Andy tried to tag along . They told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , to Mike 's eleven , still young enough to bawl and pitch a fit and threaten to tell their mom . Mike chucked a pebble at him and called him a baby and swore to pound him to hell and back if he squealed to anybody . The kid went off , still crying , with lots of You 'll be sorries flung back over his shoulder . He ran down the hill toward Wanner Road . They 'd come up to the quarry the back way , through the fields and brush , but if you 're eight and you 're in a hurry to get your older brother in trouble , Wanner Road 's the quickest way home . Soon 's he was out of sight Mike and Ed forgot about him and tried to light up the Marlboros Ed had pinched from his dad . They heard the scream first , high and thin and too far away . Then the roar of the engine . They both knew what was up . The green car and the hit-and-runs were all anybody talked about . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravel drive that leads into the quarry turns into Wanner Road . They came in on the tail end of disaster , little Andy lying on the road , crying , with his shirt ripped and blood on his face and knees and elbows , and the green car just kind of oozing along the macadam , like it was stalking him . Mike yelled something and charged at the car . Ed , when he told his version later , said he was right behind Mike , but I do n't know , I mean , it was n't his kid brother about to get squashed . They both agree that Andy scrambled up when he heard Mike 's voice and started bleating for his brother . Maybe the car was scared it might lose out on its victim , because it stopped its farting around and shot straight after Andy . Lucky for everybody Wanner Road is a piece of crap at the best of times , and does n't get borough maintenance that often . The car hit a pothole - one of those hefty ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim off . The bumper missed Andy by maybe an inch , Ed said . If it was n't for that pothole , Andy would 've been gloop on the blacktop . By that time Mike had got hold of Andy and dragged him off the road and back up into the grass . He figured the driver would take off , now that there were witnesses around . But that did n't happen . Damned if that car did n't wheel around , Mike said , and aim its grill at him and Andy , and them with nowhere to run . That 's when Ed redeemed himself , or shook off his shock , or got really , really stupid , or all three . He ran at the car from the side and tried to yank open the passenger door . Do n't ask me what he was thinking . After the reward money , maybe . The door was locked or stuck or something and would n't budge , but Ed got a good look inside . Then the car roared its engine and leaped like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeds . The front end just missed Mike and Andy , but the back end tagged Mike a solid one on the hip as it fishtailed past . It shot up Wanner Road and disappeared . This was back before everyone in the world had a cell phone , so they had to limp themselves over to the nearest house and ask if they could use the phone to call the cops . The lady who lived there took one look at " em and dialed 911 on the spot . They got our cops , state cops , an ambulance , and I think the Fire Marshal , and the Channel 14 Action News Van . The green car got bumped up from local menace to six o'clock headline . Little Andy was okay , turns out . He just had some scrapes and bumps and was scared half to death . Mike had it worse : that last tap from the car 's rear end came near to busting his hip . They had to take him and Andy in the same ambulance " cause they would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a bunch of bruises . He did n't tell the grownups anything , not even our cops . Maybe if Officer Will 'd been there he might 've spoke up . But he was off-duty then so Ed did n't , except to say it was the green car for sure , and to point out which way it went . Mike and Andy got to stay overnight at the hospital , but they sent Ed home after maybe an hour . Then we all got together and he told us everything , from snitching his dad 's Marlboros to watching the car tag Mike before it flew up Wanner . And he told us what he saw inside when he looked through the window . " Nobody . There was n't nobody driving . I thought maybe it was some kids hid down on the floor and pushing the pedals , y'know ? So I even looked there . But there was n't nobody . Swear to God . " OUR COPS and the statics beat the bushes for maybe three hours without turning up anything . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Ed told his story I got to thinking . About cars gone feral . Cars with a taste for blood . Cars that hated us because we made them to carry us around and serve us . A car like that 's not gon na be found unless it wants to be . Two weeks back , while everybody else was out poking around parking lots and side streets with thoughts of rewards in their heads , I was cruising my bike around the edge of town , on the gravel roads and maintenance lanes and dirt drives . In the wild places . Most of them dead-ended into brush tangles or narrowed out into game trails , but for a couple of dozen yards or so stayed wide enough to hide a car . I 'd been up by the quarry before , but did n't find anything . But then , I had n't stayed long . Because I 'd heard something like a growl , and caught a glimpse of a shine in the undergrowth . Probably a dog , with the sunlight glinting off its eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gleam I glimpsed was headlights . I do n't know for sure because I lit out of there and did n't look back . I did n't tell anybody " cause I did n't want to get razzed for going wussy . But maybe if I 'd said something to Officer Will , Mike and Andy wouldn't 've ended up in the hospital . So there I was , on my bike , out on Wanner Road . I was n't thinking about any reward , at least , not all that much . Mostly I was thinking about Ed 's eyes when he told us what he saw , or did n't see , through the green car 's window . And I thought about wild cars , and Officer Will , and what Mike and Andy could 've looked like . Wanner Road runs straight as a pin off 2nd Street in town right on up to the quarry . Then it doglegs right and kinda meanders around the hillside a while before it spills out onto Coventry Pike . The quarry 's got a gated fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that the deer hunters use . Come the end of November you see pickup trucks parked along it in the morning , sometimes two abreast . If it 's wide enough for two side-by-side pickups , a car could slide in with no trouble . The cops were all gone when I got to the quarry . It was coming up on late afternoon by then . I was walking my bike up the gravel drive when I heard a car on the road . I got me and my bike up into the trees just in time . Car 17 tooled up Wanner like she meant serious business , with Officer Will behind the wheel . I 'm sure the other cops had told him they 'd already combed the place . But that was Officer Will . Had to check it out for himself . Car 17 slid around the potholes smooth as mama 's stockings , almost like she could see " em . When she slowed , my heart rate speeded up , and I shrank back further under the trees . I was sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . Car 17 turned in at the entrance and trundled to a stop on the gravel , and Officer Will got out . Nobody 'd worked the quarry since my grandpop was my age , but there were still sheds and a garage and enough bare spots to park a car . Even though the cops had n't found him , they probably figured the green car 's whacko driver was hiding out up there . It would n't be the first time some bum or group of bums or whatnot had set up living quarters there and had to be rooted out . Officer Will had a big iron key that he tried on the gate . It took him a bit of grunting and twisting , but he finally jiggled it open . It swung in with a screech that clawed at my ears and told the whole world they were here . Officer Will thinned his eyes at the road and the trees and the decrepit quarry buildings . Then he went in , murmuring into his hand radio . Car 17 stayed outside the fence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my bike and started sneaking through the trees over to the fence so I could see . By now I was telling myself the cops had it right , some sick bum was holed up here and he was using his car to run people down . He went after Mike and Andy and Ed because they got too close to his hideout . Ed and what he said he saw was just a load of crap . Cars do n't drive by themselves . I could n't see from where I was , so I edged along the fence to over by the gate . I scrunched down in the weeds and hoped Officer Will would n't notice me . I was being really stupid , worse than Ed even . He might 've shot at me by accident . But hey , I was eleven then . You expect a kid to have sense ? I was at the gate and peering through it when a bomb went off behind me . Least , that 's what it sounded like . I almost jumped out of my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shriek . Turns out it was 17 backfiring . A shut-off car with its engine cooling does n't backfire . It ca n't . But I did n't think of that till way later . Anyway , both of us whirled , me with my one hand still clutching the fence . That 's when we spotted the green car , crawling up the drive toward us , quiet as a ghost . Car 17 's backfire had wrecked its ambush . The green car was n't happy about getting found out , and it let us know it with a big engine rev that sounded like a tiger roaring . It did n't accelerate . It lunged . Right up the drive , right through the open gate , right at Officer Will . Officer Will yelled into his radio and clawed for his service pistol , then dove for cover . The car shot by him and nearly rammed a toolshed , but veered off just in time . I could see the steering wheel spinning , with no hands on it . No driver . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rasp of its engine and the scrape of its tires on the grit . Nobody started this car , or steered it , or parked it or put on its brakes . It had run to wildness , gone feral , and it found it liked the taste of human blood . Kids or cops , anything would do . It chugged and coughed and set its tires for another run . Now Officer Will had his gun out , and he was firing at the tires . One bullet pinged off the bumper , but another hit the front left tire dead on and punctured it . That just made the car 's engine growl all the nastier . Did n't slow it down any , either . It went right for him on three good tires and one flabby donut of rubber . He held his ground and kept shooting , aiming at the grill now , trying to hit the carb or the battery or some other mechanized vital organ . I hung onto the fence with my feet stuck tight to the ground , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Officer Will and the green car , with just his gun between them . He held his ground a bit too long . The car came at him and he dodged . It clipped his side and sent him spinning . He hit hard and did n't get up . The green car raced on right through the gate , then hit the drive and swung around . I swear to Cod , it favored that bad tire , like a dog with a hurting paw . But it was n't done yet . It set its sights on Officer Will and pointed its grill dead at him . Then it leapt forward again . Car 17 rammed it in the side . She was parked . Her engine was off . But she moved and she moved with a purpose . She hit the green car and knocked its aim off and sent it careening almost into the fence . Then she rammed it again , a body blow to the passenger side . Its bad tire popped with a crack like a gunshot . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood as she backed away . The green car screamed . I swear it screamed . A big long whistle like a teakettle , or maybe a hot radiator . It limped around and glared at 17 through its headlights . She 'd positioned herself in the center of the yard , between the green car and Officer Will , who still lay stunned on the ground . They were partners , and she had his back . The green car took a run at her . She leapt to meet it . They hit full on like a couple of bull elk in rut , with one almighty crash . Car 17 eased back , with her hood all crumpled and her bumper askew . But the green car had taken the worst of it . When it lurched aside , it left a trail of oil , and I think maybe brake fluid . Its engine made a high thin noise that had all sorts of mad in it . Car 17 made no noise at all , except for the crunch of her tires on the gravel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kind of sidled along the fence like it wanted to get to the gate . Car 17 angled to block it . Suddenly it flew into reverse , and slid past her before she could stop it . It ran backwards at full speed , aimed at Officer Will . He was up on his knees by now , groping around for his gun . He found it just as the car came at him . He rolled like mad out of its way , then snapped off a pair of shots . At least one bullet , maybe both , hit the other front tire . The green car skidded and lurched , and its front end scraped dirt for a couple of seconds . Then 17 charged in . She was all over that car like a bad case of rust , ramming and slamming . It tried to go for Officer Will again , and she sideswiped it a good one . The green car made one last run for the gate , but with both front tires gone it could n't do better than a hobble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the fence . She used her body to wedge it in tight . Up against the wall , sleazebag . The green car 's engine made wheezy crackling noises , like it was cursing , or crying . Officer Will moved up in a crouch , yelling , " Out of the car ! Out of the car now ! " His face was gray as old paste . Guess he was n't used to his own car catching the bad guy without him . But he patted her crumpled hood before he moved in on the green car . " Hold him , " he said . I heard that clear as day . Her engine purred in response . Officer Will grabbed hold of the passenger door handle and flung the door wide and aimed his gun in . " Christ Jesus , " he said . He slammed the door . No Down on the ground and hands on your head . That was n't going to happen . I think he knew that before he opened the door . He patted 17 's hood again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached into his pocket and pulled out a jackknife . Because the only way to kill an evil car is by cutting its gas line . And that 's when the green car went for broke . It squealed away from the fence , and left a long scrape of paint on Number 17 's side and a long strip of chrome on the ground . It reared up on its good back tires , full speed in reverse . It never slowed or swerved . That 's just how it went over the edge of the quarry . I did n't see it go in , but I heard the splash . I turned loose of the fence then and ran inside . I had to see . Officer Will and I reached the edge at about the same time . We were just in time to watch the green car 's front end sink out of sight in the water . I do n't know how long I stared at the ripples , but when I finally looked away I saw Officer Will staring at me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all along ? " " Yeah , " I said . Oh crap , was I in for it . He moved his mouth around a lot , like he was trying a couple of sentences on for size , but discarding them before they got to be words . Finally he said , " A crime scene 's no place for a kid . Get your ass out of here . " " Yessir . " And I ran , with a wide detour around 17.1 swear her one good headlight glared at me . I made it back to my bike just as the first backup unit came racing up Wanner Road . I pedaled home like I was jet-propelled . I threw my bike on the lawn and ran upstairs and did n't come out of my room until after dinner . I could n't . Every time I heard a car I 'd start shaking and my skin would go goosebumpy . I could n't go down in front of Mom and Dad like that . Call me wussy if you want to , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my room was Dad roaring up the stairs at me to come down and see this . " This " was the story on the news . It was all over local channel 14 for a good twenty minutes at least . They 'd dredged the green car out of the quarry . It was all banged up and battered and hung on the end of the hoist like a big dead fish . Some cop 's face , Captain Somebody , filled the screen . He said they 'd got a tip and tracked the homicidal driver to the quarry . After a tense shootout , the driver ran his car off the edge . Whether it was suicide or a botched escape attempt , the captain was n't making a guess . A team of divers was on the way , he said , to search the quarry bottom for the driver 's body . He was specific on body . No way anybody could 've survived that plunge , and the water temperature was like minus subzero down there . That 's why you kids should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These places are dangerous . The interview was all him . Officer Will stood off in the background and did n't say much of anything . Mostly he stayed next to 17 , checking over her damage . Maybe talking to her . Comforting her . It was hard to tell . I found out later Officer Will cut the green car 's gas line and put a bullet through its engine soon 's they got it to the surface . Nobody tried to stop him . The car did n't go to impound , either . They towed it straight to the junkyard , with a full police escort . By the time the update aired on the eleven o'clock news , the green car had been destroyed . THE CASE of the Hit and Run Homicides , as the papers played it up , made the front page of every daily and a couple of weeklies for about twenty miles around . The official story was , it was some nutcase from out of town who used his car to kill at random . The cops had frogmen scouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all sorts of holes and hangups down there , so they did n't expect to find a corpse . Two nights later Officer Will dropped by our place . He assured Mom I was n't in any trouble and asked if he could talk with me a minute . We went out on the front porch and chatted about nothing until Mom stopped peering through the curtains and went away . First thing I did when we hit the porch was stare at the curb . Officer Will had brought his personal car , an old Jag he was nursing back to hot status . He saw where I was looking , but did n't say anything until Mom left . " She 's in the shop . That mother banged her up something fierce . " " But she 's okay ? " He peered down at me kinda funny . " Yeah . She 'll be okay . " We did n't say anything for a while . Then he got right to the point . " You saw the news ? " " Uh-huh . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to try yanking me . I told you he was cool . " Because there was n't any driver . Was there ? " He was staring at the curb too , at the Jag sitting there all quiet and normal . Just a car . " I do n't have any explanations , or I 'd offer one . The wild car theory 's the best I can do , and that 's just a fairy tale . What I need to know is what you 're telling the other kids . " " Nothing . I did n't say a word . And I 'm not going to . " Except maybe later to Ed , in private , so he would n't go crazy and get locked away or something . He saved Mike and Andy . We owed him . " I 'm eleven . That does n't mean I 'm stupid . " He accepted that . But I had to ask . " So what about 17 ? " That got me a shrug , and his full-on smile . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had a laugh , then he left . The next day I had an earnest talk with Ed , and we swore on our souls never to tell . Days passed and no body turned up at the quarry . Then somebody knocked over the convenience store on Coventry Pike , and life got back to normal . The Hit and Run Homicides dropped off the news and gradually faded away . The average cop car , Joel told me once , only stays in use about three years . But Officer Will would n't give up 17 . He even offered to buy her . So the borough kept her in service . As long as she wanted to run , they were willing to let her . About five years after the fight at the quarry , Officer Will responded to a domestic disturbance call . On Wanner Road , of all places . Some guy got to fighting with his wife , and it spilled outside . Officer Will tried to calm the guy down . The guy pulled a gun and shot him three times point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn and rammed the guy and pinned him up against the side of his own house and held him there until backup arrived . Officer Will died at the scene . After the guy got lugged off to jail and the ambulance took Officer Will , they tried to move 17 . She would n't budge . Her engine would n't even turn over . They could n't figure out what was wrong " cause she had n't even been shot at . Finally the borough sent a tow truck , and they hauled her to the garage . That was the story of Officer Will and Car 17 . I 'd never told the whole thing through to anybody , but I told it to her , lying there under her chassis where no one but she could hear me . Reminding her of what she was and what she meant to us . " I know you 're hurting . We all are . We all miss him . But you 're different . You 're a cop . You have to go back out there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out behind some garage . He 'd want you out on the street , stopping speeders and killer cars and stuff . Protecting and serving , like it says on your door . You ca n't just let that go . " She did n't make any noises , so I do n't know if she was listening . But I heard footsteps on the gravel . One set was foel 's sneakers . The other was boots . " Okay , kid , " somebody said . " Get out of there . " I rolled out from under 17 . The boots belonged to Herschel Wertz , Simpson 's son-in-law and the guy who ran Simpson 's Garage . Joel 's boss . Joel was standing next to him and looking about ten years old , more scared for his job than for me . " He said he could fix her , " he babbled . " I 'm really backed up , and there 's nobody here , and I know him and he 's okay with cars , so I - " " Broke the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The guy looked at me , then at 17.1 think his eyes softened , just a little . Everyone had liked Officer Will . " Any luck with her ? " he asked me . " I du n no , " I said . " I did what I could . " He nodded . " You 're Chuck , right ? I 've heard good things about you . But do n't push it again . Now get lost . " I bobbed my head and ducked past him , but he 'd already turned his glare on Joel . " As for you - " Whatever Joel meant to blather got lost in the rumble of 17 's engine turning over . It stopped me cold and dropped Joel 's jaw . Wertz went " Huh ? " and ambled over to look . Her hood was still up . There was her engine , purring away , all her belts and pistons running like they were supposed to . " You said you could n't find anything wrong with her , " Wertz said to Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It was just a couple wires , " I said . " Could 've got knocked loose anywhere . Joel would 've found " em the minute he put her up on the rack . " " Uh-huh . " Wertz peered down at the engine . Joel sidled around him and stuck his hand in through the open driver 's side window . Car 17 's engine shut off . Wertz looked from Joel to me , then to 17 . " I 'll cut you both a break this time . Get that car roadworthy so we can get it back to the department . You know how much them things cost ? " He stalked off toward his office , head cocked to watch us to make sure we followed . We dutifully trotted after him . Joel 's face was pasty , and he would n't look back at 17 . Maybe he was thinking , like I was , how her keys were still in his pocket . They got Car 17 a new panner and put her back out on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she transferred in from Collier . Joel said she had a solid record as a cop . I wondered how well she knew cars . Pretty well , it turned out . Her dad had been a mechanic . She took her new job seriously , and treated her patrol car with respect . Pretty soon the stories started cropping up again : robbers busted , cariackers thwarted , speeders chased down and caught by the lady cop in the car that did things it shouldn't 've . Officer Tanya took it in stride . " A cop 's a cop , " she said to a bunch of us once , and patted 17 's hood . " The lady and I are here to get the bad guys off the streets . Make the world a safer place for you kids . And speaking of safety , you on the bike , why are n't you wearing a helmet ? " No need to worry about Officer Tanya and her car . They were both in good hands . SO THAT 'S HOW it happened , back when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , it did n't make me want to be a cop , or a mechanic . I 'm aiming to become a teacher . Who'd 've imagined that ? The end came while I was away at school . Joel told me about it . There was some accident , and Officer Tanya and Car 17 were racing to the scene . Some guy on a cell phone ran a stop sign and plowed into them . Car 17 got knocked into the path of a truck , and her front end got smashed all to hell . Officer Tanya was pretty banged up , too , but she still crawled out of the wreckage and insisted on arresting the guy before the EMTs loaded her into the ambulance . " I never saw her , " the other driver insisted , even though she had her lights on and her siren blaring . I heard he was thinking of suing the borough , something about speeding police putting innocent people at risk . They took Officer Tanya to the hospital and 17 to the garage . Joel was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he heard about Car 17 , he went down to the garage and they let him in , like he 'd let me in umpteen years ago . It was bad , he told me . Her frame was skewed , and her engine was cracked in three places . But the worst , he said , was when he touched her . She 'd always felt a little warm to the touch , he said , especially on the hood , even when the engine 'd been off for hours . Now it just felt like cold , dead metal . " Dead " being the word that rang hardest in his mind . There was no fixing her , so they scrapped her . Took her to the junkyard and crushed the remains . Whatever 'd been in her was long gone by then , so I do n't think she felt anything . I went by the graveyard my last trip home , to check out a rumor I 'd heard . It turned out to be true . Somebody 'd put a car 's steering wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headstone . The maintenance crew had left it there , and no mourners or kids had touched it . I wanted it to be 17 's , so I told myself it was .
