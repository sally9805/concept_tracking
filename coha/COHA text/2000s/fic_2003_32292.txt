Chapter One Rayford Steele had endured enough brushes with death to know that the clich was more than true : Not only did your life flash before your mind 's eye , but your senses were also on high alert . As he knelt awkwardly on the unforgiving red rock of the city of Petra in ancient Edom , he was aware of everything , remembered everything , thought of everything and everybody . Despite the screaming Global Community fighter-bombers-larger than any he had ever seen or even read about-he heard his own concussing heart and wheezing lungs . New to the robe and sandals of an Egyptian , he tottered on sore knees and toes . Rayford could not bow his head , could not tear his eyes from the sky and the pair of warheads that seemed to grow larger as they fell . Beside him his dear compatriot , Abdullah Smith , prostrated himself , burying his head in his hands . To Rayford , Smitty represented everyone he was responsible for-the entire Tribulation Force around the world . Some were in Chicago , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in New Babylon . And as the Jordanian groaned and leaned into him , Rayford felt Abdullah shuddering . Rayford was scared too . He would n't have denied it . Where was the faith that should have come from seeing God , so many times , deliver him from death ? It was n't that he doubted God . But something deep within-his survival instinct , he assumed-told him he was about to die . For most people , doubt was long gone by now ... there were few skeptics anymore . If someone were not a Christ follower by now , probably he had chosen to oppose God . Rayford had no fear of death itself or of the afterlife . Providing heaven for his people was a small feat for the God who now manifested himself miraculously every day . It was the dying part Rayford dreaded . For while his God had protected him up to now and promised eternal life when death came , he had not spared Rayford injury and pain . What would it be like to fall victim to the warheads ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicolae Carpathia to know the man would not cut corners now . While one bomb could easily destroy the million people who-all but Rayford , it seemed-tucked their heads as close to between their legs as they were able , two bombs would vaporize them . Would the flashes blind him ? Would he hear the explosions ? feel the heat ? be aware of his body disintegrating into bits ? Whatever happened , Carpathia would turn it into political capital . He might not televise the million unarmed souls , showing their backsides to the Global Community as the bombs hurtled in . But he would show the impact , the blasts , the fire , the smoke , the desolation . He would illustrate the futility of opposing the new world order . Rayford 's mind argued against his instincts . Dr. Ben-Judah believed they were safe , that this was a city of refuge , the place God had promised . And yet Rayford had lost a man here just days before . On the other hand , the ground attack by the GC had been miraculously thwarted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that , trust , believe , have confidence ? Because he knew warheads . And as these dropped , parachutes puffed from each , slowing them and allowing them to drop simultaneously straight down toward the assembled masses . Rayford 's heart sank when he saw the black pole attached to the nose of each bomb . The GC had left nothing to chance . Just over four feet long , as soon as those standoff probes touched the ground they would trip the fuses , causing the bombs to explode above the surface . Chloe Steele Williams was impressed with Hannah 's driving . Unfamiliar vehicle , unfamiliar country-yet the Native American , who had been uncannily morphed into a New Delhi Indian , handled the appropriated GC Jeep as if it were her own . She was smoother and more self-confident than Mac McCullum had been , but of course he had spent the entire drive across the Greek countryside talking . " I know this is all new to you gals , " he had said , causing Chloe to catch Hannah 's eye and wink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the weathered pilot and former military man , who referred to all the women in the Trib Force as " little ladies " but did not seem consciously condescending . " I got to get to the airport , " he told them , " which is thataway , and y'all have got to get into Ptolemas and find the Co-op . " He pulled over and hopped out . " Whicha you two is drivin ' again ? " Hannah climbed behind the wheel from the backseat , her starched white GC officer 's uniform still crisp . Mac shook his head . " You two look like a coupla Wacs , but ' course they do n't call ' em that anymore . " He looked up and down the road , and Chloe felt compelled to do the same . It was noon , the sun high and hot and directly overhead , no clouds . She saw no other vehicles and heard none . " Do n't worry about me , " Mac added . " Somebody 'll be along and I 'll catch a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and slung it over his shoulder . Mac also carried a briefcase . Gustaf Zuckermandel Jr. , whom they all knew as Zeke or Z , had thought of everything . The lumbering young man in Chicago had made himself into the best forger and disguiser in the world , and Chloe decided that the three of them alone were the epitomes of his handiwork . It was so strange to see Mac with no freckles or red hair . His face was dark now , his hair brown , and he wore glasses he did n't need . She only hoped Z 's work with her dad and the others at Petra proved as effective . Mac set down his bags and rested his forearms atop the driver 's side door , bringing his face to within inches of Hannah 's . " You kids got everything memorized and all ? " Hannah looked at Chloe , fighting a smile . How many times had he asked that on the flight from the States and during the drive ? They both nodded . " Lemme see your name tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Indira Jinnah from New Delhi , " Mac read . Chloe leaned forward to where he could see hers . " And Chloe Irene from Montreal . " He covered his own name tag . " And you 're on the staff of who ? " " Senior Commander Howie Johnson of Winston-Salem , " Chloe said . They 'd been over it so many times . " You 're now the ranking GC officer in Greece , and if anybody doubts it , they can check with the palace . " " Awright then , " Mac said . " Got your side arms ? This Kronos character , at least a relative of his , has some more firepower . " Chloe knew they needed more firepower , especially not knowing what they would encounter . But learning the Luger and the Uzi-which they knew the Greek underground could supply-had been more than enough to tax her before they left Chicago . " I still say the Co-op people are going to clam up when they see our uniforms , " Hannah said . " Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The radio under the dashboard crackled . " Attention GC Peacekeeping forces . Be advised , Security and Intelligence has launched an aerial attack on several million armed subversives of the Global Community in a mountain enclave discovered by ground forces about fifty miles southeast of Mizpe Ramon in the Negev Desert . The insurgents murdered countless GC ground troops and commandeered unknown numbers of tanks and armored carriers . " Global Community Security and Intelligence Director Suhail Akbar has announced that two warheads have been dropped simultaneously , to be followed by a missile launched from Resurrection Airport in Amman , and that the expected result will be annihilation of the rebel headquarters and its entire personnel force . While there remain pockets of resistance around the world , Director Akbar believes this will effectively destroy 90 percent of the adherents of the traitorous Judah-ites , including Tsion Ben-Judah himself and his entire cabinet . " Chloe 's hand flew to her mouth , and Hannah grabbed her other hand . " Just pray , girls , " Mac said . " We all but knew this was comin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's easy to say from here , " Chloe said . " We could lose four people , not to mention all the Israelis we promised to protect . " " I 'm not takin ' it lightly , Chloe . But we got a job to do here too , and this is no safer than a mountain under a bomb attack . You keep your wits about you , hear ? Listen to me-we wo n't know what happened at Petra till we see it with our own eyes or hear it from our people . You heard the lies already , from the GC to their own forces ! We know for sure there 's only a million people in Petra and- " " Only ? ! " " Well , yeah , compared to several million like they said . And armed ? No way ! And did we kill GC forces-murder ' em , I mean ? And what about commandeering those- " " I know , Mac , " Chloe said . " It 's just- " " You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irene . And remember everything we went over in Chicago . You may have to fight , defend yourselves , even kill somebody . " " I 'm ready , " Hannah said , making Mac cock his head . Chloe was surprised too . She knew Hannah had warmed to this assignment , but she could n't imagine Hannah wanted to kill anyone any more than she did . " The gloves are off , " Hannah said , looking to Chloe and then back to Mac . " We 've gone way past diplomacy . If it 's kill or be killed , I 'm killing somebody . " Chloe could only shake her head . " I 'm just saying , " Hannah said , " this is war . You think they wo n't kill Sebastian ? They very well already could have . And I 'm not counting on finding this Stavros girl alive . " " Then why are we here ? " Chloe said . " Just in case , " Hannah said , using the Indian lilt Abdullah had taught her in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , hefting his bags again . " Our phones are secure . Keep the solar receptors exposed during the daytime- " " C'm on , Mac , " Chloe said . " Give us a little credit . " " Oh , I do , " Mac said . " I give you more than a lot of credit . I 'm impressed , tell you the truth . Comin ' over here for somebody you 've never met , well , at least you , Chloe . And Hannah , er , Indira , I do n't guess you got to know George well enough to give a-to , uh , care that much about him personally . " Hannah shook her head . " But here we are , are n't we ? " Mac said . " Somebody was here workin ' for us , and best we can figure out , he 's in trouble . I do n't know about you , but I 'm not leavin ' here without him . " Mac spun and stared at the horizon , causing Chloe and Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it moved their way . " Y'all run along now , " Mac said . " And keep in touch . " Rayford 's first inkling was that he was in hell . Had he been wrong ? Had it all been for naught ? Had he been killed and missed heaven in spite of it all ? He was unaware of separate explosions . The bombs had caused such a blinding flash that even with his eyes involuntarily pressed shut as tightly as his facial muscles would allow , the sheer brilliant whiteness seemed to fill Rayford 's entire skull . It was as if the glare filled him and then shone from him , and he grimaced against the sound and heat that had to follow . Surely he would be blown into the others and finally obliterated . The resounding boom sent a shock wave of its own , but Rayford did not topple , and he heard no rocks falling , no mountainous formations crashing . He instinctively thrust out his hands to steady himself , but that proved unnecessary . He heard ten thousand wails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even with his eyes closed , he saw the whiteness replaced by orange and red and black , and now , oh , the stench of fire and metal and oil and rock ! Rayford forced himself to open his eyes , and as the thunderous roar echoed throughout Petra he realized he was ablaze . He lifted his robed arms before his face , at least temporarily unaware of the searing heat . He knew his robe , then flesh , then bone would be consumed within seconds . Rayford could not see far in the raging firestorm , but every huddled pilgrim around him was also ablaze . Abdullah rolled to one side and lay in a fetal position , his face and head still cocooned in his arms . White , yellow , orange , black roaring flames engulfed him as if he were a human wick for a demonic holocaust . One by one the people around Rayford stood and raised their arms . Their hoods , their hair , their beards , faces , arms , hands , robes , clothes all roared with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rayford looked above their heads but could not see the cloudless sky . Even the sun was blotted out by the massive sea of raging flames and a pair of roiling mushroom clouds . The mountain , the city , the whole area was afire , and the fumes and plumes and licking flames rose thousands of feet into the air . What must this look like to the world , Rayford wondered , and it struck him that the mass of Israelis were as dumbfounded as he . They staggered , eyeing each other , arms aloft , now embracing , smiling ! Was this some bizarre nightmare ? How could they be engulfed by the slaughtering force of the latest in mass-destruction technology yet still stand , squinting , with puzzled looks , still able to hear ? Rayford opened and closed his right fist , inches from his face , wondering at the hissing flarelike tongues of fire that leaped from each digit . Abdullah struggled to his feet and turned in a circle as if drunk , mimicking the others by raising his arms and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire from their bodies melding and contributing to the whole . Abdullah pulled back to look Rayford in the face . " We are in the fiery furnace ! " the Jordanian exulted . " Amen ! " Rayford shouted . " We are a million Shadrachs , Meshachs , and Abednegos ! " Chang Wong joined the other techies in his department as their boss , Aurelio Figueroa , led them to a huge television monitor . It showed the live feed from the cockpit of one of the fighter-bombers as it circled high above Petra , broadcast around the world via the Global Community News Network . Later Chang would check his recording of the bug in Carpathia 's office to monitor the reactions of Nicolae , his new secretary Krystall , Leon , Suhail , and Viv Ivins . " Mission accomplished , " the pilot reported , scanning the target and showing square miles raging in flames . " Suggest subsequent missile sequence abort . Unnecessary . " Chang clenched his teeth so tight his jaw ached . How could anyone survive that ? The flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the pilot had to avoid it to keep the picture clear . " Negative , " came the reply from GC Command . " Initiate launch sequence , Amman . " " That 's overkill , " the pilot muttered , " but it 's your money . Returning to base . " " Repeat ? " The voice sounded like Akbar himself . " Roger that . Returning to base . " " That 's another negative . Continues ...
