We are so used to storing our computer files in folders and scrolling through lists of online-search results that it may seem perverse to try to reinvent the way we view these things on our computer screen . But two companies are aiming to do just that . Fractal:Edge has developed an interface called Fractal:PC ( $20 ; available in March ) that replaces file folders in Windows with a system of colored circles , above . Each circle represents a folder . If a circle is green , it means you have recently modified a file in that folder . If a circle is red , it means you have n't . To look inside each circle ( folder ) , you simply rest your mouse over it for a moment . The company claims Fractal:PC makes it easier to find folders and files , in part because you do n't have to click to open a folder .
