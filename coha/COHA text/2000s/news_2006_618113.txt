<p> Sarasota , Fla.  --  At 9:56 on a sun-kissed morning a few miles off the southwest Florida coast , Christopher Jung slipped into the sea he loved one last time . <p> His wife of 11 years , Laurie , steadied herself on the deck of a fishing boat as a crew on a nearby shrimper carefully lowered a large cement structure containing his cremated remains into the cool , green ocean . <p> Moments later a fluorescent orange buoy surfaced , signaling Christopher " Chris " Hyowon Jung  --  a 45-year-old avid diver and deep-sea fisherman from Roswell  --  had reached his final resting place at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . <p> " This is so my husband , " Laurie Jung said , removing her black sunglasses to blot tears streaming down her cheeks . " This is where he 'd want to be , his last fishing trip . " <p> Plenty of people scatter loved ones ' ashes at sea . But with the help of an Atlanta company , Eternal Reefs , Laurie Jung said goodbye in an unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to attract new life . <p> Jung and about two dozen others on the battered blue-and-white boat have mixed family members ' cremated remains with marine-grade concrete to form an artificial reef , called a " reef ball . " Once on the ocean floor it creates a rocky ecosystem that 's home to a wide variety of plant and animal life , some of it threatened or endangered . <p> " It 's such a fitting memorial for Chris to be at sea , which he so loved so dearly , " Laurie Jung said , " while giving back to the environment . " <p> About 450 miles away , Eternal Reefs ' three employees are based in a two-story house on a shaded street in Atlanta 's Virginia Highland neighborhood . <p> Since 2001 , Eternal Reefs has handled arrangements for more than 350 people and animals , burying them in government-protected reef beds off the Southeastern coast . <p> " This is building public reefs with private money , " said Eternal Reefs ' George Frankel . <p> A father-in-law 's request <p> The company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a University of Georgia graduate , started Reef Ball Development Group , which manufactured concrete " reef balls " designed to help save the disappearing reefs . Reef balls are intertwined on the ocean floor , where algae and other plants attach themselves . <p> In 1998 , Brawley 's father-in-law , Carlton Glen Palmer , asked Brawley if he would inter his remains in one of the reef balls . He died a short time later , and Brawley fulfilled his request . Eternal Reefs was born . <p> Brawley patented his formula for reef balls and got EPA approval to drop them in the ocean . The Army Corps of Engineers and local municipalities also must approve the sites . Brawley brought on Frankel , a high school buddy , and , later , Chuck Kizina , a scuba instructor with a background in the funeral home business . <p> Once someone dies and their ashes are mailed to Eternal Reefs , the family spends a weekend building the memorial reef at a Sarasota concrete yard . <p> The memorial reefs are gray and porous , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish to swim through . They can hold the cremains of a person , a pet or a family . <p> To be put into a community reef  --  where ashes can be mixed with those of strangers  --  costs $995 . From there , prices range from $1,995 to $4,995 depending on the size . <p> Each reef ball has a bronze plaque with the deceased 's name and an inscription . Family members get satellite coordinates of the memorial , and many later dive to see them , Brawley said . <p> A goodbye ceremony <p> On a recent day , Laurie Jung and her group gathered at Marina Jack in Sarasota at 7:30 a.m . <p> There were a couple of children , but most were adults from around the country , strangers who 've come to know one another through the lengthy process . <p> The salt air was penetrated by the smell of a cigarette a woman was smoking and the coffee another sipped as they prepared to board " Flying Fish II , " the 75-foot fishing boat Eternal Reefs chartered to take them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the open-air boat began navigating the channel that would lead to the pristine waters of the Gulf . <p> About a dozen of those on board were there for Dave Wolff , a 39-year-old self-proclaimed adventurer who died in a motorcycle crash in South Florida last year . <p> " He was a lover of the ocean , " said his mother , Joyce . " To put him in a box and put him on a dresser would not be fitting . " <p> Reef ' what he wanted ' <p> Chris Jung was stunned when he was diagnosed with late-stage cancer last October . He and Laurie , who loved diving in the Florida Keys , decided his ashes would be scattered there . <p> Later , Laurie remembered hearing about Eternal Reefs on a Discovery Channel special . She showed him the company 's video presentation as he lay dying . <p> " He immediately agreed that 's what he wanted , " his widow said . Chris Jung died at home April 21 . <p> About the same time Jung was diagnosed last fall , Debby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of her mother and her beloved golden retriever off the Florida coast . <p> " I could not think of anything more I could do for my mother than to have her in the place she loved , " Murray said during last week 's trip . <p> Eternal Reefs staffers in the shrimp boat lowered the memorial reefs into the water . After the final memorial reef was lowered , the shrimper departed and the Flying Fish II moved into position over the memorial site . The families had been given football-sized replicas of the reefs ( no remains inside ) , which they decorated with flowers and mementos . <p> One by one , family members dropped their replica reefs into the ocean . <p> " Goodbye , my honey . I miss you , " Laurie Jung mouthed as she dropped her reef  --  adorned with orange birds of paradise , her husband 's favorite  --  into the water . <p> As crew members readied the boat for the 30-minute trip back to land , a line of yellow and pink carnations bobbed in the boat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each name over a loudspeaker , and the captain sounded the vessel 's foghorn for each loved one lost . <p> As he does on each voyage , Frankel concluded by reading from John F. Kennedy 's famous speech , " The Sea . " <p> " I really do n't know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea . ... I think it 's because we all come from the sea . ... And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean . <p> " And therefore we have salt in our blood , in our sweat , in our tears . We are tied to the ocean , and when we go back to the sea  --  whether it is to sail or to watch it  --  we are going back from whence we came . " <p> A LIVING MEMORIAL : HOW IT WORKS <p> 1 .

From there , Eternal Reefs staffers drive the cremains to a concrete yard in Sarasota , Fla . <p> 4 . Family members spend a weekend building the reef memorials in Sarasota . They combine the cremains with a special concrete mixture and let it set overnight . <p> 5 . Later , family members head out on a chartered boat for a memorial at sea . Eternal Reefs staffers lower the reefs into the ocean . <p> 6 . The reefs then attract animal and plant life for years to come . Photo : FRANK NIEMEIR / StaffMemorial reefs
