ON THE FRINTHIAN PLANE dreams are not private property . There is no such thing as a dream of one 's own . A troubled Frin has no need to lie on a couch recounting dreams to a psychoanalist , for the doctor already knows what the patient dreamed last night , because the doctor dreamed it too ; and the patient also dreamed what the doctor dreamed ; and so did everyone else in the neighborhood . <p> To escape from the dreams of others or to have a secret dream , the Frin must go out alone into the wilderness . And even in the wilderness , their sleep may be invaded by the strange dream-visions of lions , antelope , bears , or mice . <p> While awake , and during much of their sleep , the Frin are as dreamdeaf as we are . Only sleepers who are in or approaching REM sleep can participate in the dreams of others also in REM sleep . <p> REM is an acronym for " rapid eye movement , " a visible accompaniment of this stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of electro-encephalic wave . Most of our rememberable dreams occur during REM sleep . <p> Frinthian REM sleep and that of people on our plane yield very similar EEG traces , though there are some significant differences , in which may lie the key to their ability to share dreams . <p> To share , the dreamers must be fairly close to one another . The carrying power of the average Frinthian dream is about that of the average human voice . A dream can be received easily within a hundred-meter radius , and bits and fragments of it may carry a good deal farther . A strong dream in a solitary place may well carry for two kilometers or even farther . <p> In a lonely farmhouse a Frin 's dreams mingle only with those of the rest of the family , along with echoes , whiffs , and glimpses of what the cattle in the barn and the dog dozing on the doorstop hear , smell , and see in their sleep . <p> In a village or town , with people asleep in all the houses round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shifting phantasmagoria of their own and other people 's dreams which I find it hard to imagine . <p> I asked an acquaintance in a small town to tell me any dreams she could recall from the past night . At first she demurred , saying that they 'd all been nonsense , and only " strong " dreams ought to be thought about and talked over . She was evidently reluctant to tell me , an outsider , things that had been going on in her neighbors ' heads . I managed at last to convince her that my interest was genuine and not voyeuristic . She thought a while and said , " Well , there was a woman - it was me in the dream , or sort of me , but I think it was the mayor 's wife 's dream , actually , they live at the corner - this woman , anyhow , and she was trying to find a baby that she 'd had last year . She had put the baby into a dresser drawer and forgotten all about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it - Had it had anything to eat ? Since last year ? O my word , how stupid we are in dreams ! And then , oh , yes , then there was an awful argument between a naked man and a dwarf , they were in an empty cistern . That may have been my own dream , at least to start with . Because I know that cistern . It was on my grandfather 's farm where I used to stay when I was a child . But they both turned into lizards , I think . And then - oh yes ! " she laughed - " I was being squashed by a pair of giant breasts , huge ones , with pointy nipples . I think that was the teenage boy next door , because I was terrified but kind of ecstatic , too . And what else was there ? Oh , a mouse , it looked so delicious , and it did n't know I was there , and I was just about to pounce , but then there was a horrible thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and huge , hairy hands groping at me - and then I heard the three-year-old next door screaming , because I woke up too . That poor child has so many nightmares , she drives us all crazy . Oh , I do n't really like thinking about that one . I 'm glad you forget most dreams . Would n't it be awful if you had to remember them all ! " <p> Dreaming is a cyclical , not a continuous activity , and so in small communities there are hours when one 's sleep-theater , if one may call it so , is dark . REM sleep among settled , local groups of Frin tends to synchronize . As the cycles peak , about five times a night , several or many dreams may be going on simultaneously in everybody 's head , intermingling and influencing one another with their mad , inarguable logic , so that ( as my friend in the village described it ) the baby turns up in the cistern and the mouse hides between the breasts , while the eyeless monster disappears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dream , perhaps a dog 's , since the pig is rather dimly seen , but is smelt with enormous particularity . But after such episodes comes a period when everyone can sleep in peace , without anything exciting happening at all . <p> In Frinthian cities , where one may be within dream-range of hundreds of people every night , the layering and overlap of insubstantial imagery is , I 'm told , so continual and so confusing that the dreams cancel out , like brushfuls of colors slapped one over the other without design ; even one 's own dream blurs at once into the meaningless commotion , as if projected on a screen where a hundred films were already being shown , their soundtracks all running together . Only occasionally does a gesture , a voice , ring clear for a moment , or a particularly vivid wet dream or ghastly nightmare cause all the sleepers in a neighborhood to sigh , ejaculate , shudder , or wake up with a gasp . <p> Frin whose dreams are mostly troubling or disagreeable say they like living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but lost in the " stew , " as they call it . But others are upset by the constant oneiric noise and dislike spending even a few nights in a metropolis . " I hate to dream strangers ' dreams ! " my village informant told me . " Ugh ! When I come back from staying in the city , I wish I could wash out the inside of my head ! " <p> EVEN ON OUR PLANE , young children often have trouble understanding that the experiences they had just before they woke up are n't " real . " It must be far more bewildering for Frinthian children , into whose innocent sleep enter the sensations and preoccupations of adults accidents relived , griefs renewed , rapes reenacted , wrathful conversations with people fifty years in the grave . But adult Frin are ready to answer children 's questions about the shared dreams and to discuss them , defining them always as dream , though not as unreal . There is no word corresponding to " unreal " in Frinthian ; the nearest is " bodiless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' incomprehensible memories , unmentionable acts , and inexplicable emotions , much as do children who grow up on our plane amid the terrible incoherence of civil war or in times of plague and famine ; or , indeed , children anywhere , at any time . Children learn what is real and what is n't , what to notice and what to ignore , as a survival tactic , a means of staying alive . It is hard for an outsider to judge , but my impression of Frinthian children is that they mature early , psychologically ; and by the age of seven or eight they are treated by adults as equals . <p> As for the animals , no one knows what they make of the human dreams they evidently participate in . The domestic beasts of the Frin seemed to me to be remarkably pleasant , trustful , and intelligent . They are generally well looked after . The fact that they share their dreams with their animals might explain why the Frin use animals to haul and plow and for milk and wool , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sensitive dream-receivers than human beings , and can receive dreams even from people from other planes . Frinthian farmers have assured me that their cattle and swine are deeply disturbed by visits from people from carnivorous planes . When I stayed at a farm in Enya Valley the chicken-house was in an uproar half the night . I thought it was a fox , but my hosts said it was me . <p> People who have mingled their dreams all their lives say they are often uncertain where a dream began , whether it was originally theirs or somebody else 's ; but within a family or village the author of a particularly erotic or ridiculous dream may be all too easily identified . People who know one another well can recognize the source-dreamer from the tone or events of the dream , its style . But after all , it has become their own as they dream it . Each dream may be shaped differently in each mind . And , as with us , the personality of the dreamer , the oneiric I , is often tenuous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very puzzling dreams or those with powerful emotional affect may be discussed on and off all day by the community , without the origin of the dream ever being mentioned . <p> But most dreams , as with us , are forgotten at waking . Dreams elude their dreamers , on every plane . <p> It might seem to us that the Frin have very little psychic privacy ; but they are protected by this common amnesia , as well as by doubt as to any particular dream 's origin , and by the obscurity of dream itself . And their dreams are truly common property . The sight of a red and black bird pecking at the ear of a bearded human head lying on a plate on a marble table and the rush of almost gleeful horror that accompanied it - did that come from Aunt Unia 's sleep , or Uncle Tu 's , or Grandfather 's , or the cook 's , or the girl next door 's ? A child might ask , " Auntie , did you dream that head ? " The stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , the truth . <p> Frinthian families and small communities are close-knit and generally harmonious , though quarrels and feuds occur . The research group from Mills College that traveled to the Frinthian plane to record and study oneiric brainwave synchrony agreed that ( like the synchronization of menstrual and other cycles within groups on our plane ) communal dreaming may serve to strengthen the social bond . They did not speculate as to its psychological or moral effects . <p> From time to time a Frin is born with unusual powers of projecting and receiving dreams - never one without the other . The Frin call such a dreamer whose " signal " is unusually clear and powerful a strong mind . That strong-minded dreamers can receive dreams from non-Frinthian humans is a proven fact . Some of them apparently can share dreams with fish , with insects , even with trees . A legendary strong mind named Du Ir claimed that he " dreamed with the mountains and the rivers , " but his boast is generally regarded as poetry . <p> Strong minds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream that she lives in a warm , amber-colored palace without directions or gravity , full of shadows and complex rhythms and musical vibrations , and shaken often by slow peaceful earthquakes - a dream the whole community enjoys , though late in the pregnancy it may be accompanied by a sense of pressure , of urgency , that rouses claustrophobia in some . <p> As the strong-minded child grows , its dreams reach two or three times farther than those of ordinary people , and tend to override or co-opt local dreams going on at the same time . The nightmares and inchoate , passionate deliria of a strong-minded child who is sick , abused , or unhappy can disturb everyone in the neighborhood , even in the next village . Such children , therefore , are treated with care ; every effort is made to make their life one of good cheer and disciplined serenity . If the family is incompetent or uncaring , the village or town may intervene , the whole community earnestly seeking to ensure the child peaceful days and nights of pleasant dreams . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly came to everyone in the world , and who therefore also dreamed the dreams of everyone in the world . Such men and women are revered as holy people , ideals and models for the strong dreamers of today . The moral pressure on strong-minded people is in fact intense , and so must be the psychic pressure . None of them lives in a city : they would go mad , dreaming a whole city 's dreams . Mostly they gather in small communities where they live very quietly , widely dispersed from one another at night , practicing the art of " dreaming well , " which mostly means dreaming harmlessly . But some of them become guides , philosophers , visionary leaders . <p> There are still many tribal societies on the Frinthian plane , and the Mills researchers visited several . They reported that among these peoples , strong minds are regarded as seers or shamans , with the usual perquisites and penalties of such eminence . If during a famine the tribe 's strong mind dreams of traveling clear down the river and feasting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the journey and the feast so vividly , with such conviction , that they decide to pack up and start downriver . If they find food along the way , or shellfish and edible seaweeds on the beach , their strong mind gets rewarded with the choice bits ; but if they find nothing or run into trouble with other tribes , the seer , now called " twisted mind , " may be beaten or driven out . <p> The elders told the researchers that tribal councils usually follow the guidance of dream only if other indications favor it . The strong minds themselves urge caution . A seer among the Eastern zhud-Byu told the researchers , " This is what I say to my people : Some dreams tell us what we wish to believe . Some dreams tell us what we fear . Some dreams are of what we know though we may not know we knew it . The rarest dream is the dream that tells us what we did not know . " <p> Frinthia has been open to other planes for over a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great influx of visitors . Many tourists avoid the plane under the impression that the Frin are a race of " mindsuckers " and " psychovoyeurs . " <p> Most Frin are still farmers , villagers , or town-dwellers , but the cities and their material technologies are growing fast . Though technologies and techniques can be imported only with the permission of the All-Frin government , requests for such permission by Frinthian companies and individuals have become increasingly frequent . Many Frin welcome this growth of urbanism and materialism , justifying it as the result of the interpretation of dreams received by their strong minds from visitors from other planes . " People came here with strange dreams , " says the historian Tubar of Kaps , himself a strong mind . " Our strongest minds joined in them , and joined us with them . So we all began to see things we had never dreamed of . Vast gatherings of people , cybernets , ice cream , much commerce , many pleasant belongings and useful artifacts . ' Shall these remain only dreams ? ' we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' So we have done that . " <p> Other thinkers take a more dubious attitude toward alien hypnogogia . What troubles them most is that the dreaming is not reciprocal . For though a strong mind can share the dreams of an alien visitor and " broadcast " them to other Frin , nobody from another plane has been capable of sharing the dreams of the Frin . We can not enter their nightly festival of fantasies . We are not on their wavelength . <p> The investigators from Mills hoped to be able to reveal the mechanism by which communal dreaming is effected , but they failed , as Frinthian scientists have also failed , so far . " Telepathy , " much hyped in the literature of the interplanary travel agents , is a label , not an explanation . Researchers have established that the genetic programming of all Frinthian mammals includes the capacity for dream-sharing , but its operation , though clearly linked to the brainwave synchrony of sleepers , remains obscure . Visiting foreigners do not synchronize ; they do not participate in that nightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But unwittingly , unwillingly - like a deaf child shouting they send out their own dreams to the strong minds asleep nearby . And to many of the Frin , this seems not so much a sharing as a pollution or infection . <p> " The purpose of our dreams , " says the philosopher Sorrdja of Farfrit , a strong dreamer of the ancient Deyu Retreat , " is to enlarge our souls by letting us imagine all that can be imagined : to release us from the tyranny and bigotry of the individual self by letting us feel the fears , desires , and delights of every mind in every living body near us . " The duty of the strong-minded person , she holds , is to strengthen dreams , to focus them - not with a view to practical results or new inventions , but as a means of understanding the world through a myriad of experiences and sentiences ( not only human ) . The dreams of the greatest dreamers may offer to those who share them a glimpse of an order underlying all the chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginings of daily and nightly existence . <p> " In the day we are apart , " she says . " In the night we are together . We should follow our own dreams , not those of strangers who can not join us in the dark . With such people we can talk ; we can learn from them and teach them . We should do so , for that is the way of the daylight . But the way of the night is different . We go together then , apart from them . The dream we dream is our road through the night . They know our day , but not our night , nor the ways we go there . Only we can find our own way , showing one another , following the lantern of the strong mind , following our dreams in darkness . " <p> The resemblance of Sorrdja 's phrase " road through the night " to Freud 's " royal road to the unconscious " is interesting but , I believe , superficial . Visitors from my plane have discussed psychological theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's views of dream are of much interest to them . The Frinthian " royal road " is trodden not by one secret soul but a multitude . Repressed feelings , however distorted , disguised , and symbolic , are the common property of everybody in one 's household and neighborhood . The Frinthian unconscious , collective or individual , is not a dark wellspring buried deep under years of evasions and denials , but a kind of great moonlit lake to whose shores everybody comes to swim together naked every night . <p> And so the interpretation of dreams is not , among the Frin , a means of self-revelation , of private psychic inquiry and readjustment . It is not even species-specific , since animals share the dreams , though only the Frin can talk about them . <p> For them , dream is a communion of all the sentient creatures in the world . It puts the notion of self deeply into question . I can imagine only that for them to fall asleep is to abandon the self utterly , to enter or reenter into the limitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
