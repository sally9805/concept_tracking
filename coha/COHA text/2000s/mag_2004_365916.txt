Andy Hanson , 24 , is on a mission to break the most popular arcade game in America , a simulated golf match called Golden Tee . Over the next few months , he will spend days swinging at trees , walking into water hazards and bashing the game buttons as hard as he can , really trying to give the console a good whack . <P> Esteemed employee that he is , Hanson hopes to make the game stall , crash or buzz like a bad toaster . And , yes , he wreaks this havoc for a living , working as many as seven days a week in a Chicago-area office the size of a strip mall . <P> Video-game abuse has become a career these days , a crucial part of the $11 billion video-game industry . Hanson is a quality-assurance tester , who plays through every conceivable video-game scenario , looking for bugs , or problems , in a program before they hit the real world . Testers report glitches  --  a character walking offscreen , for example  --  to their company 's programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the game goes back to the testing department for further scrutiny , and the cycle repeats , often for months , until the game is bug free . " Testers are a special breed , " says Richard Ditton , executive vice president of Incredible Technologies , the company that makes Golden Tee . " They somehow delight in breaking things . " But he adds , " If they tell us not to ship a product , we wo n't . " <P> Just one undetected bug in Golden Tee could cost the company as much as $100,000 , the price of fixing the problem and sending an update from its headquarters in Arlington Heights , Ill. , to game operators around the world . It 's a frightening figure , Ditton says , when you consider the multitude of things that could go wrong with the programming , affecting everything from a game 's 3-D images to its virtual sportscaster . <P> It used to be that video games were tested by their creators and perhaps a few colleagues . Today 's titles , however , are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Testers are a lot like the crash-test dummies of the industry , " says Jason Della Roca , director of the International Game Developers Association , a professional society . First-year testers make about $32,000 , while bug hunters with six or more years in the field earn about $53,000 , according to Game Developer magazine . <P> At Incredible Technologies , Hanson and his colleagues toil away in a dimly lighted room with charcoal gray carpeting , messing with the latest version of Golden Tee , due in 500 locales in November . Each tester has a code-melting specialty  --  simulating a drunken frat boy , for example  --  but all suggest that talent goes only so far when they 're breaking games until sunrise . Admits Hanson : " You 're just doing the same redundant thing , over and over again . " Sounds par for the course .
