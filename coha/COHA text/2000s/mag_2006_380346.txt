Anxiety about avian flu is spreading far faster than the disease . Watch enough reports on television about the outbreaks in Turkey , and you could worry yourself sick . In my opinion , the anxiety is unfounded . At the moment , the H5N1 influenza virus is mainly a threat to birds . The virus can infect and kill other animals but only if they have close contact with infected birds . The big concern is that it will gain the ability to pass easily from person to person , possibly by exchanging genes with an ordinary flu virus in the body of some unlucky person infected with both . That has not happened yet , and until it does , there can be no pandemic . Much has been made of the virulence and lethality of the avian-flu virus , but new findings suggest that mild and asymptomatic infections in humans may have gone unnoticed ; the virus may turn out to be far less deadly than we have been led to believe . Even if it does mutate into a more transmissible form , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general pattern of all influenza pandemics , including the terrible one of 1918.
