The East End is n't just for New Yorkers anymore . Its genteel Main Streets , stunning beaches and top-flight restaurants are drawing discerning travelers from across the country and around the world . Edited by heidi mitchell AT THE FAR EASTERN end of Long Island , a forty-mile stretch of bucolic beach towns beckons with an unexpected mix of rustic charm and glossy high style . Though it was cultivated for decades as an insular retreat for New Yorkers , the Hamptons has emerged of late as one of the most inviting locations for travelers worldwide . Photograph : PHOTOGRAPHS , THIS PAGE AND OPPOSITE : BRIAN DOBEN One reason for the community 's broad appeal is the diversity of its hamlets , from sleepy Sag Harbor to the more social pace of East Hampton . The common thread shared by most of these villages is Montauk Highway ( Route 27 ) , the thoroughfare that snakes across the region , sometimes past pristine farmland and rugged , windswept dunes , sometimes right through the middle of town . Two hours east of Manhattan , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Water Mill , Bridgehampton , Sagaponack , Wainscott , East Hampton , Amagansett and finally Montauk ( locals refer to it as the End , which it actually is ) . Photograph : The main attraction on Sag Harbor 's Main Street . Whichever town you visit , the season 's high point is the Fourth of July , replete with wall-to-wall parades , parties , fireworks , busy shops and Main Streets awash in flags . But there is another , less public incarnation of the Hamptons : meandering roads canopied by ancient elms leading past the homes of celebrities , VIPs and billionaires , people you 're likely to see riding around in restored hot rods or on bicycles . Even the most privileged seem to bend to the casual mandate . Above all else , the natural beauty of this part of the world is hard to match . The Hamptons may indeed appear to be something straight from a Hollywood soundstage , yet to those who migrate here cyclically with the tidal pull of summer , this is the most authentic of American retreats . SOUTHAMPTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hamptons  --  one of the oldest in the entire state of New York , in fact  --  and there are ample historic remnants to show for it . The Old Guard still thrives in Shingle-style houses bordered by impeccably manicured privet hedges and at private clubs for golf , tennis and bathing . Main Street and its environs go a long way toward making these residents feel at home , with such preppy offerings as Brooks Brothers , Lilly Pulitzer , Stubbs &; Wootton , Ralph Lauren , J. McLaughlin and J. Crew ; the pace is a little slower than in neighboring hamlets , as Montauk Highway does n't pass through downtown . Popular beaches run the gamut from the European-friendly Flying Point to the perfect sands off Gin Lane : Cryder Lane , Cooper 's and Little Plains . Photograph : East Hampton 's 1770 House , where antiques mingle with modern conveniences . Your morning is well-spent people-watching over a cappuccino at Sant Ambroeus ( 30 Main Street ; 631-283-1233 ; santambroeus.com ) , where impossibly attractive Europeans gather at the espresso bar . Fine Italian dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . You wo n't need a reservation at Silver 's ( 15 Main Street ; 631-283-6443 )  --  the restaurant does n't accept them  --  which you 'll surely be thankful for after sampling the outstanding lobster-accented menu at lunch ( it also does n't serve dinner ) . The meticulously restored 1708 House ( doubles from $145 ; 126 Main Street ; 631-287-1708 ; 1708house.com ) has a secret . In addition to three spacious cottages and twelve bedrooms in its handsomely decorated main house , there 's a gorgeous private wine bar tucked beneath its first floor , accessible only to hotel guests ; stone walls , exposed beams and tables set with backgammon and chessboards complete the cozy picture .

BRIDGEHAMPTON Along with the adjacent hamlets of Water Mill , Sagaponack and Wainscott , Bridgehampton was historically a farming community . The recent building boom may have done away with much of the evidence , but cornfields , vineyards and roadside farm stands still enhance the landscape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a popular annual polo tournament and the Hampton Classic Horse Show . The best local beaches include Gibson , Mecox and Sagg Main . Within the whitewashed walls of Loaves &; Fishes ( 50 Sagg Main Street ; 631-537-0555 ; landfcookshop.com ) , in a shack just off Montauk Highway , lobster salad  --  infamously priced at $100 a pound in summers past  --  is among the bespoke takeout alongside prepared meats , onion tarts , fish salads and baked desserts . The same owners operate the Bridgehampton Inn ( doubles from $390 ; 2266 Main Street ; 631-537-3660 ; bridgehamptoninn.com ) , which runs a cooking school to complement its six guest rooms . Casual dining in Bridgehampton is excellent : World Pie ( 2402 Montauk Highway ; 631-537-7999 ) serves family fare and pizza from a wood-burning oven ; the Candy Kitchen diner ( 2391 Main Street ; 631-537-9885 ) is known for its burgers and French fries as well as homemade ice cream that is as fantastic as its star-watching . East of Bridgehampton , in Wainscott , is Main Beach Surf &; Sport ( 352 Montauk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from all over the Hamptons for the gear , expertise and activities offered , including canoeing in neighboring Georgica Pond . SAG HARBOR This former whaling town still prides itself on the 18th-century architecture and salty landmarks of its heyday . But judging by its picturesque harbor , currently filled with yachts , and residents like Cindy Sherman and E.L . Doctorow , it seems that Sag Harbor has settled nicely into its new glory days . The beaches you 'll want to visit : Long Beach , off Noyac Road , and Haven 's Beach , off Bay Street . The unquestioned hub of Sag Harbor is the American Hotel ( doubles from $400 ; 49 Main Street ; 631-725-3535 ; theamericanhotel.com ) , renowned for its excellent Continental fare , attentive service and homey wood-paneled ambience . It 's an inviting place , even if it is notoriously difficult to get a reservation , be it for lunch , dinner or one of its eight well-appointed guest rooms . Just down Main Street is the in-demand Sen ( 23 Main Street ; 631-725-1774 ; seninthehamptons.com ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Sag Harbor 's real ace in the hole , and a prime location to enjoy it is Tutto il Giorno ( 6 Bay Street ; 631-725-7009 ) , a modern Italian restaurant co-owned by Gabby Karan de Felice ; right next door is Urban Zen ( 4 Bay Street ; 631-725-6176 ; urbanzen.org ) , a fashion and lifestyle shop owned by her mother , Donna Karan . EAST HAMPTON The lively village of East Hampton encompasses a compelling mix of sequestered residential enclaves and formidable public thoroughfares for shopping and dining . Vying for your attention here is Ralph Lauren , with no fewer than four outposts , as well as Gucci , Tory Burch , Catherine Malandrino , Tiffany , Coach , Elie Tahari and J. Crew . Beaches range from the private shores of the Maidstone Club and the Georgica Association to the public Main Beach , where you 're just as likely to have a bona fide celebrity sighting . In the early 19th century , East Hampton was one of the first towns in the area to open accommodations for travelers , and it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them beautifully aged and restored , on the same idyllic stretch of Main Street near Town Pond . At the head of the class is the Baker House 1650 ( doubles from $695 ; 181 Main Street ; 631-324-4081 ; bakerhouse1650.com ) , which has just five rooms and the most immaculate interior and grounds , including 200-year-old wisteria vines . To the east is the 1770 House ( doubles from $495 ; 143 Main Street ; 631-324-1770 ; 1770house.com ) , where large flat-screen televisions in the seven guest rooms stand out among the antiques . It also has two good restaurants : one , a tavern below the main level , features an imposing fireplace and a full slate of comfort food ; the forty-seat dining room upstairs is more formal . The venerable Maidstone Arms ( doubles from $395 ; 207 Main Street ; 631-324-5006 ; maidstonearms.com ) is under new ownership and plans to reveal its refreshed interior and restaurant this spring .

Cittanuova ( 29 Newtown Lane ; 631-324-6300 ; cittanuova.com ) is the newest addition in town , with a contemporary Italian menu and a young well-dressed clientele . AMAGANSETT From its low profile and quiet Main Street , you 'd never guess that Amagansett ranks among the region 's richest hamlets and houses most of the Hamptons ' celebrities : Gwyneth Paltrow , Sarah Jessica Parker and Alec Baldwin , to name a few . Albert 's Landing , Atlantic Avenue and Indian Wells are the top beaches . Stephen Talkhouse ( 161 Main Street ; 631-267-3117 ; stephentalkhouse.com ) is home to year-round live music and has been the site of impromptu performances by Paul Simon , Billy Joel and Paul McCartney , all of whom have homes nearby . The Napeague Stretch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , has some of the Hamptons ' best surfing and freshest seafood , so it 's not surprising that you 'll find casual fish shacks with terrific offerings . The Lobster Roll ( 1980 Montauk Highway ; 631-267-3740 ; lobsterroll.com ) , also known simply as Lunch , serves lobster salad on hot-dog rolls as well as steamers and crab cakes . Farther east is the Clam Bar ( 2025 Montauk Highway ; 631-267-6348 ) , a roadside shack  --  complete with a dining counter and bar stools  --  that sells lobster rolls in addition to fish-and-chips and clam chowder . And back in town , at the former site of the long-standing Gordon 's , is Mezzaluna AMG ( 231 Main Street ; 631-267-3010 ) , scheduled to open this month with an Italian menu similar to that of the original restaurant on Manhattan 's Upper East Side .
