Time capsules tell us a lot about what people in the past thought the future would be like . If you happen to be putting together a time capsule right now , please do not include this column . ALL MY LIFE , I have wanted to stop time . I see almost no value in the future , and I suspect that virtually every technological advance since the advent of the gramophone has been  --  on balance  --  detrimental to the human race.1 Our slow erosion of authentic consciousness will never stop , and there is nothing we can do about it . This , of course , is merely my opinion , solely based on anecdotal evidence . As such , it 's possible that my opinion is wrong . And I certainly hope that is the case , because if I have learned only one thing from existence , it is ( probably ) this : It is more lucrative to write about why things are good than about why things are bad , chiefly because the former is so much more complicated than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enslavement to the very elements of modernity that I bemoan ; for the purposes of my own psychological security , it would be nice to believe that " progress " is actually progress , even though it ( usually ) is not . This is a story about slowly flying to Tulsa and not seeing a car . GETTING THERE In June of 1957 , the community of Tulsa buried a Plymouth Belvedere in a downtown concrete bunker beneath the Oklahoma topsoil . The car would act as the public vortex for a time capsule that would be unearthed five decades later . It would also be the grand prize in a stridently futuristic contest : During the summer of its entombment , various local citizens were given the opportunity to guess what the population of Tulsa would be in 2007.2 Whoever was closest ( and was , presumably , still alive ) would win the ( now classic ) car , along with several gallons of gasoline and oil . It appears that people in 1957 were n't positive that gas and oil would still be in use half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be : We used to imagine that cars of the future would probably run on uranium , potato peels , and distilled water . Photograph : Illustration by David Hughes It was this optimism that drew me to Tulsa . The motive behind any time capsule is inherently positive  --  at worst , it suggests some kind of ( non-robot-dominated ) future will , at least , exist . Cynics do n't bury cars in the ground . The excavation was scheduled for June 15 of this year ; it was the linchpin for an event unironically titled Tulsarama ! I left for Tulsa on June 14 . Unfortunately , I elected to travel via Northwest Airlines , an organization whose incompetence would be best described as Ruthian . The problems start immediately : My plane out of LaGuardia airport sits motionless for almost an hour , causing me to miss a connecting flight in Detroit . The airline redirects me to Minneapolis , but that flight is also delayed ; when I do arrive in Minnesota , I miss another connection and find myself forced to stay overnight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. flight ( to Memphis ! ) , but the plane does n't take off until 7:40 A.M. No explanation is given . This causes me to miss another connection , so I sit in the Memphis airport3 for four hours . My eventual flight to Tulsa is also late . I miss the excavation entirely . That fucking car was in the ground for fifty fucking years , and I still could n't get there on time . It 's too bad the 9/11 terrorists did not patronize Northwest Airlines ; they undoubtedly would have been stranded in Logan airport until they all collectively renounced Islam . When I finally arrive in Tulsa , the city is abuzz over Tulsarama ! , at least judging from the front page of the Tulsa World . Almost every hotel is filled to capacity . However , there 's now a shared grimness regarding the condition of the Plymouth Belvedere : Several feet of water seeped into the vault , coating the vehicle in rust and grime . They remove it from its watery tomb , but there is no possible way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay positive . " This is nobody 's fault , " a seventy-three-year-old man named Jim Sosebee tells me as we share a cab ride downtown . Now living in Texas , Sosebee had been an Oklahoma marine when he attended the car 's funeral in 1957 . " Back in those days , nobody knew nothing about waterproofing a concrete vault . " I assume this man knows what he 's talking about , but I 'm still a little surprised by this revelation . Waterproofing a concrete vault seems exactly like something people would have understood fifty years ago . BEING THERE Having missed everything except Saturday night 's Tulsarama ! Sock-Hop ( Fabian , Bobby Vee , and the Chiffons are scheduled to perform ) , I decide to find a bar and drink until my situation improves . This turns out to be harder than one might anticipate ; taverns do n't seem to exist here . I have lived in some of the least exhilarating cities in America , but Tulsa is almost like urban sarcasm . Tulsa makes Akron seem like Las Vegas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reenactment of the opening ten minutes of 28 Days Later . All the avenues have names like Denver and Detroit and Cincinnati , as if those cities were theoretical , unattainable utopias . The townsfolk are incredibly nice , but the emptiness is relentless ( and kind of terrifying ) . I ca n't fathom what things are like here when they 're not having a festival . After forty-five minutes of meandering , I finally find a restaurant called Tsunami Sushi , just up the street from a dive bar called Dirty 's and another called 1974 . There is a superthin kid outside the sushi restaurant wearing an apron and smoking a cigarette . His name is Eli , he 's nineteen ( bearded and laid-back ) , and he 's on break from his job as a cook . We talk a little about the ' ' 57 Belvedere and the town that buried it . " I hate Tulsa , but only because I live here , " says Eli  --  the kind of sentiment anyone who comes from anywhere can instantly understand . " Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love working at Tsunami 's , for example . The people who work here are hella cool . And Tulsa has some awesome underground tunnels . Huge , train-sized tunnels . They 're amazing . " I do n't know what this means , 4 so I ask him how he views the future . I ask him what he thinks the world will be like in 2057 . " I 'm pretty pessimistic , " he says . " The way America spends its money , the way we are hated around the world . . . I do n't know if there will ever be an all-out war , 5 but people are walking around angry . " I ask him when ( or how ) America went wrong ; curiously he says , " Disco . " Considering that this kid was born eleven years after the release of Saturday Night Fever , I find his thesis intriguing . " It was terrible music , " he explains . " And it was all flash . It was just something to make stupid people happy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishes his cigarette , and we shake hands . He goes back inside to work . I continue to sit on a bench outside the restaurant , staring at a barren street . Two minutes later , a different nineteen-year-old comes outside for five minutes of smoking . This kid 's name is Levi.6 He 's a busboy with a ponytail . And unlike Eli , he adores Tulsa . He will never leave . " I love it here , " says Levi . " In my opinion , it 's the world 's biggest little city . I know they say that about Reno , but they should say it about Tulsa . This is kind of a hard thing to explain , but there is so much action here  --  it 's just that there 's nothing to do . " I sort of know what he means , but not totally . When I question Levi about his vision for the future , he insists that he 's very optimistic . But when I ask him why , his reasoning is confusing : He starts talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the problematic issues with Tulsa 's exploding Hispanic population . He tells me , " Every street in this town is dangerous at 1:00 A.M. Every single one . " Why , I ask , would these things make him enthusiastic ? " Tulsa is growing like crazy , " he says . " It 's headed in the right direction . " And then his cancer stick is extinguished , so Levi returns to busing tables . Obviously , these are just two nineteen-year-olds , chosen in a manner that 's less than random . Neither is a metaphor for anything . But I want to point something out : One of these teenagers was pessimistic about the future while 1 ) enjoying the present and 2 ) worrying about the past . The other was optimistic about tomorrow , despite the fact that his description of today was terrible . It took me a while to figure out which person I could relate to more . I 'm still not completely sure . LEAVING THERE Not wanting to be on any street after 1:00 A.M. , I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles vampire novelist Anne Rice . I mention what Levi had said about the murder rate . " That 's all true , " she says as her car radio plays " Escape ( The Pina Colada Song ) " and something off the second Bad Company album . " I do n't feel safe in my own home . They will come right into your house and kill you . I wish they would all just kill one another off , because that 's all they know . " At first , I 'm pretty sure I know who they are supposed to be , so our conversation becomes vaguely uncomfortable . But then she starts talking about attending a recent Kool and the Gang concert at a casino , so who knows ? I am in no position to judge this woman . Up in my hotel room , I turn on the television . It appears I have missed the first eight minutes of the local news , so  --  once again  --  I do n't see any footage of the rusted Belvedere . Its existence mocks me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Showtime is airing Basic Instinct 2 , and Sharon Stone suddenly strikes me as the human equivalent of the ' ' 57 Plymouth : an iconic creation that was once glamorous and futuristic but that now only reminds us of a slightly better , slightly weirder past ( particularly during moments when we try to jam her back into the living present ) . Stone was born less than one year after the burial of this Belvedere . All things considered , I suppose she 's held up considerably better than the car . No water damage . I guess I do n't know why I believe the world is getting worse . It seems like it obviously must be , but I 've been wrong before . Maybe it 's my own fault . If nostalgia is remembering the past as better than it actually was , what word is its opposite ? What word describes imagining a future that will be worse than logic dictates ? Whatever it is , I need less of it . And perhaps Northwest Airlines needs more . Firewater FOR CENTURIES , nonsocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone invent water that makes me drunk ? For some reason , this eternal goal seems as unattainable as the perpetual-motion machine ; the closest we 've ever come was Zima , but that turned out to contain a radioactive isotope that made everyone gay . Still , key members of the scientific community ( or at least the ones employed by Smirnoff vodka ) keep trying . The latest offering is something called Smirnoff Source , a product billed as " the first malt beverage in the U. S. to combine pure spring water + alcohol . " I 'm not sure why its marketing team elected to use math to describe this drink , but I went to a state college . Here 's the good news : Source is remarkably crisp and refreshing ( almost thirst quenching ) . It 's like a vodka soda with way too much ice . Here 's the bad news : It 's only 3.5 percent alcohol by volume , so you need to drink about seventeen pints of this firewater to feel anything . But here 's the great news : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you add a little Fierce Melon Gatorade . I think this stuff has real potential as a complementary fluid ( I see it as the desperate man 's grenadine ) or as a means for making fourteen-year-old girls vomit . Either way , science wins again .  --  C. K. 1 A key exception : air-conditioning. 2 382,457 , roughly triple what it was in ' ' 57. 3 Excellent pork ribs there , though . I could gain a lot of weight in this airport . 4 It is speculated that these tunnels ( now used for tourism ) were used by bootleggers during Prohibition . 5 I think he means a nuclear war . 6 I have not made these names up . For whatever reason , employees of Tsunami Sushi have names like Deadwood characters . 7 Tulsa had fifty-three murders in 2006 . This was actually a slight decrease from 2005 , when it had fifty-eight . <p>
