My father was a missionary among the colored , or mixed-race , people of Beaufort West in an area of scrubland that is South Africa 's version of Arizona . That 's where I was born , and now the house where I was born is a museum . Next door is the church where my father preached , my mother played the organ and I pumped the bellows for it . Maybe that 's where , subconsciously , I started getting interested in the pump , which is all the heart is , after all . I can remember as a boy when they rang a big bell in Beaufort West at 9 o'clock , and all the colored people had to leave town for the night . My father , however , would not accept any difference between white people and black or colored people . I learned that tolerance from my father , who said to me , " Son , for some people the mills of God grind slowly but surely . " And here we are in Mandela 's South Africa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mills . <P> My mother taught me ambition . You must always be the first , she used to say . But she also tempered that with humility . I think that helped me later in life . Whatever happened to me , I always tried to find time for everybody . <P> I did n't dissect beetles or anything when I was a boy . There was no great event that made me go into medicine . I had an elder brother studying mechanical engineering , and I was interested in that . My parents had another child between my brother and me who died when he was three or four . I do n't remember him , but my father once showed me a little biscuit with the boy 's teeth marks in it . Now I look back , and I see pictures of the little boy and the terrible suffering in his face , and I realize that he died of a heart problem and that had he lived in my time , I , as a cardiac surgeon , probably could have cured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , the house was in mourning . He told me medicine was a better choice than engineering , and when I went to university , I vowed I 'd never have to tell my parents I had failed . And I never did . <P> I 've had a lot of lucky choices forced on me in my life . The first was going into medicine , not engineering . The second was having to leave a general practice , which I loved , because the business could n't support three partners . The third was applying for a bursary in England and being turned down . If I 'd got it , I would never have become a heart surgeon because they were n't that far advanced in heart surgery in England . The fourth was when I was studying general surgery under Professor Owen Wangensteen at the University of Minnesota . One day I was invited to lend a hand on work on a heart-lung machine . That 's when I became fascinated by open-heart surgery . That 's what led me back to South Africa to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplant . Before that , I had applied for a job in London , and again I was turned down . If I 'd got it , I would n't have done the heart transplant . So you see my life is full of luck .
