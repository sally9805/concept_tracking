" Huddled against the Canadian winter of 1968 , " as their " autolegend " has it , George Saia , Ronald Gabe and Michael Tims dispensed with their birth names and became , respectively , Jorge Zontal , Felix Partz and AA Bronson . " Being a trio , " they wrote in a manifesto , " frees us from the tyranny of the individual genius . " 1 Photograph FILE magazine ( vol. 5. no. 4 ) , 1983 , " Special General Idea Issue-Mondo Cane Kama Sutra , " offset periodical , 26 pages plus cover , 14 by 11 inches . // A year later , drawing a trajectory that connected Rrose Slavy to the drag queens of 1969 's Stonewall riots in New York , the three began working under another signature rubric , " Miss General Idea . " A 1971 altered photograph , which they called their " artist 's conception , " figures her as a transvestite , rubber-outfitted version of Hugo Ball at Cabaret Voltaire . Miss General Idea functioned as the group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Idea beauty pageants that set out in countercultural fashion " to ( capture ) glamour without falling into it . " 2 Contestants for the 1971 pageant were selected from the group 's artist friends , and the winner that year , Vancouver artist Michael Morris , was crowned " queen " and is remembered in the annals of General Idea activity as Marcel Idea . There followed over the course of a 25-year collaboration what seems like a tireless outpouring of museum installations , boutiques , films , performances , photographic works , manifestos and publications such as FILE magazine , which re-figured the logo and format of Life magazine . Filching anything that flowed through the contemporary art and culture media stream , File was part of the group 's overall effort to dispense with the avant-garde/popular culture divide and to co-opt promotion for the sole , Dada-like purpose of generating more promotion . It anticipated many queercore and punk zines of the later ' ' 70s and ' ' 80s ( of which , thanks to local figures like Bruce LaBruce , Toronto was a fountainhead ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the widely distributed , anti-globalist Vancouver-based publication Adbusters . During the 1980s , General Idea turned the larger part of its effort to the AIDS disaster , adapting the " viral logic " of the simulacrum , a concept they took from writer William S. Burroughs , to the production of multiples . The collaborative was enormously successful at getting the word out , Their meaningfully transgressive reinscription of Robert Indiana 's ubiquitous " LOVE " logo as " AIDS " ( 1987 ) , mass-produced and distributed on posters , billboards , tchotchkes , electronic images , lottery tickets and stamps ( it even made the cover of the Journal of the American Medical Association ) became-with Gran Fury and Donald Moffett 's brilliant Silence=Death campaign and 1989 's landmark exhibition " Witnessing : Against Our Disappearance , " curated by Nan Goldin-among the most effective works of cultural activism aimed at breaking through the denial , inaction and ineptitude in which the official response to the public health crisis was mired . With nearly 200 objects , " General Idea : Editions , 1967-1995 " is the first show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which originated at the Wrttembergischer Kunstverein in Stuttgart and toured internationally in 1992-93 ) to gather so substantial a number of the trio 's works . Barbara Fischer , director of the Blackwood Gallery at the University of Toronto at Mississauga , took on what must have been the daunting task of assembling nearly three decades of the collaborative 's multiples-daunting in that it was never , in the strict sense , General Idea 's purpose to supply museums or collectors with archivable fine-art objects . Their prints , banners and photographic material , often queered versions of work from the modernist canon , were the implements of participatory , usually ephemeral gestures and events . General Idea 's early work echoes Broodthaers 's critique of the museum industry during the late ' ' 60s and early 70s . Broodthaers turned a critical eye on the ways museums create and administrate cultural values . He devised elaborate exhibitions , such as " Museum of Modern Art-Department of Eagles " ( 1968-72 ) , which mocked the installation format and with great humor exposed the ways in which museums use art to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Idea 's first efforts focused on the production and dissemination of art 's discursive set-up material , mostly the paperwork that surrounds and supports both the creation and reception of art , including press releases , clippings , notices and reviews , exhibition announcements and invitations , self-published postcards and broadside handouts , mail-art projects , catalogues , art posters and entry kits for the Miss General Idea pageants . Most of this early material consists of offset prints appropriated from ' ' 30s and ' ' 40s fashion ads , with the urban , Deco , slightly shady but elegant ( like Toronto itself ) look of noir film . Eventually , these practices would expand into the architectural realm of pavilion , storefront and museum design , including a series of shops that functioned as small retail outlets for General Idea 's inexpensively manufactured multiples . These projects , The Belly Store ( 1969 ) for example , parodied art 's connection to commerce and suggested ways of making art available to a larger , less exclusive public . In 1974 , the group announced the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Toronto . Art Metropole still functions as a not-for-profit business , selling artists ' books and multiples online . What General Idea produced and performed was also suffused with emergent queer politics . One recognizes in the group 's numerous early chain letters and mail-art projects , such as the Orgasm Energy Chart ( 1970 ) , echoes of Ray Johnson , and , in their installation and performance work , of the earlier film and performance work of Jack Smith . Smith 's 1963 cult film classic Flaming Creatures introduced a cast of campy and erotic voluptuaries , some of them drag queens , in a series of beautiful and delirious tableaus . It drastically pushed the envelope of gender and sexual representation at the time , and was impounded immediately after its release . Drag and transgenderism are now art world and pop culture common-places ( from Madonna to Grayson Perry ) . But prior to mass culture 's absorption of these marginal practices , the immediate impact of Smith 's work on the underground activities of its day is clearly evident in General Idea 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " creatures " who participated in her pageants . Through the late ' ' 70s and into the early ' ' 80s , General Idea honed its take on the appropriationist methods that characterized the vanguard art of the period . Influenced by then-current theoretical trends , the three devised recombinant strategies that treated modernist and more recent art and found objects alike as textual objects . Magic Palette ( 1980 ) originated as a found set of colored anodized aluminum cups editioned as a cocktail service with a tray shaped like a traditional artist 's palette . A post-card of a Lucio Fontana monochrome painting with slashes from the early ' ' 60s was reformatted in 1991 as an edition of table-top Kleenex dispensers called Gesundheit ( Why Not Sneeze Lucio Fontana ? ) . The title , of course , playfully echoes Duchamp 's Why Not Sneeze Rose Slavy ? ( 1921 ) , whose own title references Duchamp 's female alter ego . General Idea 's handmade edition of glass dildo/butt plugs , Dick All ( 1993/2001 ) , provides a humorous companion piece to Duchamp 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yves Klein 's was a favored point of departure . Klein 's multidisciplinary project of the 1950s included monochrome painting , writing , martial arts , performance , musical composition and film . It furthered the movement of art beyond the formal restrictions of the individual mtier and pushed the European avant-garde toward the Nouveau Ralisme advocated by critic Pierre Restany . General Idea took great pleasure in parodying Klein 's 1958 " Anthropometries , " in which the French artist slathered his lovely female models with " International Klein Blue " paint and , using them as " living brushes , " publicly performed large-scale action paintings . For XX bleu ( 1984 ) , the collaborative used three life-size , stuffed white Standard French poodles to smear large blue X 's on enormous spans of unstretched canvas . The poodles had been fabricated by a Berlin taxidermist to General Idea 's specifications and , it must be noted , no real animal parts were used . In retrospect , it is somewhat astonishing that even prior to the AIDS epidemic and Zontal 's and Partz 's HIV-positive status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and medicine in works that were send-ups of both the pharmaceutical and taste industries . In the late 70s , Colour Bar Lounge was conceived as a laboratory-cum-cocktail bar where experimental drinks were mixed and served in test tubes . With the lounge , General Idea set out to develop a new gay science " dedicated to the eradication of abstract depressionism and the encouragement of artful research . " 3 For the Colour Bar Lounge 's , debut at the 1979 Basel Art Fair , the Italian dealer Lucio Amelio published six lounge decor images , including the famous Nazi Milk ( 1979 ) , which features an altered photograph of a uniformed blond boy , a glass of milk in his hand , the residue of milk above his lip an explicitly Hitlerian trace . The dairy industry 's more recent " Got Milk ? " ad campaign , which shows healthy , smiley models with milk mustaches who extol the presumed health benefits of the beverage , acquires a certain uncanniness in light of General Idea 's earlier image . By the early ' ' 90s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , with the consciousness of the AIDS crisis , General Idea developed an entirely new strategy for elaborating the critical meaning of older works of art : they altered them through " infection . " The signature red . green and blue of the LOVE/AIDS logo were used to chromatically replace the primary colors of a classic Rietveld chair ( Infected Rietveld , 1994 ) . The influence of Duchamp continued to pervade the collaborative 's efforts . In 1921 Duchamp proposed that Dada works might " protect against ... life 's multiple troubles , something like Little Pink Pills which cure everything . " 4 General Idea altered Duchamp 's own alterations of a found chromolithograph landscape , Pharmacie ( 1914 ) , by inserting three hovering red , green and blue capsule forms ( called " placebos " by the artists ) , and retitled it Infected Pharmacie . Photograph Gesundheit ( Why Not Sneeze Lucio Fontana ? ) , 1991 , two found postcards , Kleenex-brand packaged tissue in plastic box , by 4 3/8 by 6 inches // Infected Pharmacie , 1994 , gouache on chromogenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current exhibition , Fischer has gathered samples of the artists ' student projects , and these works make clear the consistency of General Idea 's project virtually from the outset . In the early years of the Xerox machine , Ron Gabe ( Partz ) produced a small signed edition of three photocopied reproductions of Pop works , notable among them Warhol 's 100 Soup Cans ( 1967 ) . The " Xerox Series " procured a failing grade for Partz in the printmaking course , but to a remarkable degree , it anticipated later appropriations by Sherrie Levine , Richard Prince , Ronald Jones , Nayland Blake and others . More pointedly , Partz 's choice foreshadowed the ways in which General Idea would draw on and move beyond the Warhol legacy . As the artistic purveyor of so much disaster , Warhol maintained a mechanically overdetermined " disinterested interest " in his subjects . The disturbing beauty of the " Disaster " works was achieved by projecting the banalized images of horror that pepper the tabloids onto the austere , estheticized plane of late-modern monochrome painting . Warhol 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own words , a " statement " on the " harsh , impersonal and brash materialistic objects on which America is built today . " 5 Yet after the attempt on his life , Warhol himself seemed vulnerable to the violence that his art commented upon ; the distance between the artist and his subject matter was more disassociative than esthetic or even ironic , a symptom perhaps of the trauma .

Courtesy the artist . // In contrast , General Idea launched illuminating critiques of the culture and pharmaceutical industries while not losing sight of the healing and medicinal powers of irony . Even as it was engulfed in the AIDS disaster and was losing two of its own ( Zontal and Partz both died in 1994 ) , the collaborative continued to pull off provocatively gay Duchampian pranks .

Courtesy Galerie Frdric Giroux , Paris . // Since the deaths of his partners , Bronson has produced some powerful works dealing with mortality , survival , grief and renewal . Felix , June 5 , 1994 ( 1994/99 ) features a photograph taken by Bronson of Partz in the hours that immediately followed his death . Bronson prepared Partz 's body as though for a wake , dressing it in a Klimtian array of wildly patterned textiles and arranging some of Partz 's favorite things around it : a tape recorder , cigarettes , a TV remote control .

Bronson continues to produce a wide range of projects , including sculpture , installation , video , performance and Internet works . He likens his post-General Idea experience to that of a stroke victim . " Without Felix and Jorge ( and consequently without General Idea ) , " he wrote in a recent e-mail exchange with this writer , " I found myself without an identity , and my work since then has focused on reconstructing an identity . " His 2003 show at Galerie Frdric Giroux in Paris , titled " AA Bronson*Healer , " featured a trade booth at which one could purchase a two-hour " healing session " with the artist . In the General Idea spirit of marvelous bluff-in this instance , a bluff that surely did not compromise the sessions ' personal , therapeutic and overall cultural value-Bronson issued printed certificates to authenticate and document each consumer 's purchase .
