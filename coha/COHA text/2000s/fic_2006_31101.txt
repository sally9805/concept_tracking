Los Llanos 1991 Don Chan Lee Coln de Juan Dolio ignored the stench that wafted through the valleys of Los Llanos . From the outside of his humble wooden house nothing seemed out of the ordinary . The passion fruit and mango trees were lush , shaking their leaves with the mildest of sea breezes , gossiping stories to the birds about Don Chan 's strange old-man ways . The pigeons lifted their beaks , concerned that Doa Caridad had n't left rice for them to feast on . It had been three days . No rice . No Doa Caridad . Only the strange smell from the small house where the Coln family had lived for three generations . The house sat in an abandoned landscape . Its faded rose-colored paint peeled off . The train stocked with cane stalks woke the lazy goats in the yard where they lay , as if to guard the aging couple who refused to leave Los Llanos . The hungry pigs roaming his land turned their noses away . Many from the valley had taken off to live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doa Caridad stayed behind .  --  I ca n't close my eyes without the city coming back and spitting on me , he said to the younger folk who accused him of being afraid of change . Miraluz Altagracia Natera asked the driver to park far enough away from the house so as to not jolt Don Chan . There was a stillness in Los Llanos that crept under her skin . The young man with a cleft lip who assisted Don Chan and tended to the land rich with mangoes , pltanos , cacao , and lechosas had called Miraluz weeks before .  --  I do n't think it 's right for the old lady to be so far away from a doctor , the caretaker had said .  --  Bythe time anyone gets help , it 'll be too late to save her . I do n't mean to disrespect , but nothing anyone says to the old man sinks into that hard head of his .  --  I 'll do my best , Miraluz said , knowing very well that she was the daughter Don Chan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Santo , would marry . It had been a few months since she 'd last taken a trip to Los Llanos . She often called or sent word to Don Chan , but the trip from San Pedro de Macors to Los Llanos was long enough for her to keep postponing it . Miraluz held her breath and pounded on the makeshift door . The flamboyan tree , rich with yellow flowers , bent over the porch and shaded the house from the harsh midday sun . The sky , a brilliant blue , made the cane fields iridescent .  --  Anyone home ? she yelled , contemplating whether she should pull the door open or wait .  --  Open the door . It 's me , Miraluz . She pushed against the latch . She had hired the driver for two hours and did n't have time for Don Chan 's stubbornness . As she marched inside the little house , it trembled from her haste . That damn house , over seventy years old , the only one in the area to survive numerous hurricanes , revolutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me now . The house was in complete order : the cement floors freshly mopped , the wood for the kitchen stove piled up neatly into a small pyramid , the cans of water filled to the brim ; the furniture propped against the walls , leaving the room spare , as if waiting for a gathering . Not much had changed in the eight years since she 'd moved to the city . If it had n't been for the strange odor that permeated every room , she would 've thought it was 1965 and that any minute , Santo would burst through the door with some news about the Yanquis , or Doa Caridad would have piled up the viveres in the kitchen , freshly plucked from Los Llanos 's communal garden , filling up the bellies of anyone who entered the Coln household . And Don Chan would be smoking his cigar , sitting alone somewhere , close enough to look over everyone , but far enough to gather courage for the battle . Miraluz noticed the photographs she had sent Don Chan of her children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door to the old couple 's bedroom was partly opened . Miraluz caught a glimpse of Doa Caridad on her bed , behind the mosquito net . She covered her nose with her hands and her throat swelled from holding back tears . Don Chan watched over Doa Caridad , who lay peacefully on worn yellow sheets , her brown skin turned ashen , her full lips dry and cracked . The relentless sun poured in through the window over her . The small wooden cross over the bed tipped over . His cigars rested beside a small glass of rum and a red candle lit to keep them company . A cassava shell filled with water and a yucca root placed on her nightstand for her journey .  --  She said it was her time . Don Chan 's voice cracked from disuse . Miraluz put her hand on his bony shoulders . If she let go of him , Don Chan would fall apart , he was sure of it . He had spent hours sitting by the bed , watching over his wife . He tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms over and under the sheets , changing the dial of the small radio , opening and closing the shutters , batting away the flies that sat on her face . Miraluz pressed herself against his back , and bent down to kiss his head . Her hands were warm on his neck . How long had it been since someone had touched him ? Her touch awakened his body . He had n't died with his wife . He had waited for Doa Caridad to say something to make sense of her departure . Seventy years with his old lady , and she took part of his mind with her . Do n't , he wanted to tell Miraluz , whose fingers lifted away from him . Do n't move . I ca n't bear the absence . Miraluz let go of Don Chan and saw his body fold over . She listened to his soft exhale , and walked away to allow him privacy . She asked the driver to take her to the nearest phone to call Don Chan 's son , Santo , who had moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know what to do . She hoped that his wife , Esperanza , would n't pick up the phone .
