There 's nothing easier than falling out of shape , especially in the U.S. Americans may no longer lead the world in science , engineering and productivity , but with TiVo on the flat-screen , Domino 's at the door and an arsenal of remotes within easy reach , we 've got leisure time nailed . <P> Climbing off the couch and getting back into condition is a dicier proposition . Trying to do it too fast can actually be dangerous . " Among those at greatest risk for heart-attack death is the habitually sedentary person who engages in unaccustomed physical activity , " warns Barry Franklin , physiologist and chairman of the American Heart Association 's Physical Activities Committee . Before starting even a minimal exercise program , therefore , you should call your doctor for a preworkout O.K. or even a checkup . <P> Once you 've been cleared for takeoff , the first step you take may be just that : a walking program that begins modestly and then builds up .

" I ask my patients if they could manage as little as eight to 10 minutes , " he says . " Most of the time they say they can , and then come back having done 14 or 15 .

" Besides , once you 're comfortable with a more modest workout load , you can slowly increase it  --  about 10% a week , Foster recommends . Government guidelines suggest that if you 're having trouble finding the time or energy for a full exercise session , you can still get significant health benefits from 30 to 60 minutes of exercise broken up into 10- or 15-minute segments throughout the day .
