How the Dave Matthews Band lost its way , found one another and made the best music of its career <p> DAVE MATTHEWS SINGS THE LINES IN A DEEP , grainy voice that reverberates like a steam engine in the chilly night air : " Bartender , please/Fill my glass for me/With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free/After three days in the ground . " <p> Behind him , the rest of the band fights the despair in " Bartender , " the epic highlight of the Dave Matthews Band 's new album , Busted Stuff , with muscular resolve . Drummer Carter Beauford and bass guitarist Stefan Lessard hit a marching-army groove ; Boyd Tinsley builds a wall of drone on his electric violin ; LeRoi Moore punches the beat with the elephantine honk of his baritone saxophone . <p> The extended mounting tension - Matthews repeats that chorus like a prayer - finally explodes in the song 's bridge . The band veers into a jubilant stomp , Matthews blows his voice out in high hallelujah and a row of white spotlights blazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roaring - in Shoreline Amphitheatre , south of San Francisco . <p> It is an extraordinary moment , the midpoint summit of a two-and-a-half-hour show , and Matthews knows it . On the video screen overhead , the camera zooms in on his face as he sings and smiles , one eyebrow arched in what looks like surprise , as if Matthews ca n't help asking himself : How can so many people get so much joy from a song written from deep inside a bottle ? <p> THE NEXT AFTERNOON , IN THE LONG , grand living room of his suite at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in San Francisco , Matthews talks at length and frankly about " Bartender " - in his estimation , one of the best songs he 's ever written . <p> " It 's not the happiest idea in the world , thinking about dying and what your life means , " he says , sipping coffee , his ruggedly boyish features in dark profile against the gray mist outside his panoramic windows . " And the Jesus thing is an impossible comparison : Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this bartender in front of me and save my life ? " But at the time he wrote those words , Matthews notes , " I was drinking a lot . " <p> Born in Johannesburg , South Africa , and raised on the run in the New York suburbs , in Cambridge , England , and in Charlottesville , Virginia , Matthews poured a lot of drinks for other people in his early twenties . From 1987 until the formation of the Dave Matthews Band in 1991 , Matthews worked as a bartender at a pub called Miller 's in Charlottesville where , he says , " I 'd meet people who would shatter your faith in the world . There was one fella whose wife was deathly ill . He spent everything he had , sold his business in New Jersey , because they could n't get medical insurance . I watched this man crumble . Years later , I saw him working the early shift at Dunkin ' Donuts . " <p> Matthews , now thirty-five , never fell that far . " Materially , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe . Since the release of its independent debut , Remember Two Things , in 1993 , the Dave Matthews Band has issued four RCA studio albums - Under the Table and Dreaming ( 1994 ) , Crash ( 1996 ) , Before These Crowded Streets ( 1998 ) and Everyday ( 2001 ) - plus four two-CD live sets that have sold a combined 20.7 million copies in North America . The Dave Matthews Band is also one of rock 's biggest touring attractions . In 2000 alone , the group grossed more than $80 million on the road ; last year , twenty-one of the fifty sold-out shows on the band 's summer tour were in stadiums . <p> Naturally , there was a lot of celebrating . " To me , the Dave Matthews Band was all about the life of drinking , " says Lessard , 28 . The youngest member of the band by almost two decades ( Beauford , the oldest , is forty-three ) , Lessard joined the group right out of high school . " This is how gullible I was : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tripping Billies ' - I did n't know that was from the Bible . I thought Dave came up with that . <p> " But drinking was always a positive thing , " Lessard insists . " It never got depressing . And if Dave was going too far , I never recognized it . Coming back drunk from the bar - that 's what we were all striving for . " <p> " I was what they call a joyful drunk , " Matthews says . " I 'm much more charming with a buzz on than without it . But drinking started to get in the way of things that mattered . It encouraged an indifference in me . " He makes a dismissive grunting sound . " You know , those weird noises you make when you do n't give a damn . " <p> That 's how he first recorded " Bartender " two years ago , during the Dave Matthews Band 's agonizing , ultimately scrapped 2000 sessions with producer Steve Lillywhite , now known and widely bootlegged as The Summer So Far . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says of the song curtly , " it sucks . " On Summer , he moaned and grumbled through " Bartender " like the kind of dipso you desperately try to avoid in a bar . <p> That 's not how he sings it now . Matthews has stopped drinking , at least to excess . ( " I like the way wine tastes , " he says . " I 'm not going to do anything too rash . " ) And he cites marriage and fatherhood as two big reasons for his turnaround . In August 2000 , Matthews wed his girlfriend of eight years , Ashley Harper ; the following August , Harper gave birth to twin girls , Stella and Grace . <p> " I 'm more in wonder of everything , " Matthews says . " When I wake up in the morning , it 's not so much , Ugh , what happened ? ' If I 'm away from my wife , the first thing I want to do when I wake up is call her . It 's the last thing I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , I 'm just so happy that I 'm awake to that fact . " <p> Lessard says he can tell the difference in Matthews : " His voice is much stronger onstage . We had some problems at the beginning of the year " - in April , Matthews postponed two sold-out nights at New York 's Madison Square Garden because of throat strain - " but he took care of it . He did n't talk to anybody , did n't go out and party . " <p> Busted Stuff testifies to Matthews ' new attention to clarity . Nine of the eleven songs on the record , produced by the band 's longtime engineer , Steve Harris , have been rescued from The Summer So Far and re-cut with a focus and force that opens up the hope previously hidden inside loner 's hymns such as " Busted Stuff , " " Grey Street " and " Grace Is Gone . " " The lyrical content is similar , if not exactly the same , " says Bruce Flohr , senior vice president of A &R; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has worked closely with it ever since . " But they 're not dead-end streets . I find more joy in the songs . Dave is singing them from a different emotional place . " <p> " I feel like I 've finished the picture , " Matthews says of Busted Stuff , and " Bartender " in particular . " I 'd left those songs in an ugly little pile . Going back was like seeing old friends again . This is some of the best stuff I 've ever written and some of the best stuff the band has ever played . <p> " There 's still a lot of melancholy , " he notes . " Bartender ' is still a heavy song . But it 's not a fuck-it-all song . It 's not sung by the guy you want to get away from in the bar . He 's somebody you can sit next to at the bar and go , Hey , nice to see you . ' " <p> TWO YEARS LATER , MATTHEWS keeps spotting them at gigs - hard-core fans who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the mainstream sheen of the album the Dave Matthews Band made and released instead , Everyday , produced by AOR drill sergeant Glen Ballard . At a recent show , Matthews saw a woman wearing a T-shirt that read , LONG LIVE LILLYWHITE . <p> " Which is nice - I hope he lives forever , too , " Matthews says . A British hit-maker who worked on U2 's early LPs , Lillywhite produced the Dave Matthews Band 's first three studio albums - combined sales : more than 12 million copies - before he and the group parted in May 2000 after five months of recording in Charlottesville and only the twelve tired Summer tracks to show for it . <p> Then there was the jerk who held up a sign in front of Matthews one night that said , GLEN BALLARD IS THE DEVIL . " I thought , Have you ever met the man ? ' " Matthews snaps . " I had someone take the sign away . I did n't want to find myself diving into the audience and getting bad publicity for beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the head . ' " <p> Lessard is astonished by his own small share of the grief . " I 've had fans go off on me at two in the morning , " he says , " about how much they hated Everyday and why did n't we release the Lillywhite sessions . I 'm like , You 're telling me you hate my work ? ' " <p> Beauford , a drummer of ferocious energy and forthright tongue , will tell you precisely what he does n't like about Everyday : " My creativity , my expertise , as well as that of the other guys in the band , was smothered . The record did n't need us . " Beauford replicated , beat for beat , drum licks from the Matthews-Ballard song demos . Tinsley and Moore played from charts , then had their parts folded into a mass of keyboards and power chords . <p> Everyday is tight , bright and commercial ; it has sold 3.3 million copies since its release in February 2001 . But it is not , Beauford says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Matthews and Ballard - " and they did an incredible job . " <p> Matthews is exhausted by the whole debate . " Just sitting here , doing this interview , is strange compared to what 's unfolding in the world , " he says wearily . " It 's like talking about pia coladas in a blizzard . " The fact is , he and the band were right to halt and discard the Lillywhite sessions . Steve Harris , who also engineered the Summer recordings , believes that Lillywhite and the group over-recorded Matthews ' songs to death . " Sweet Up and Down " was one Summer number that did n't make it to Busted Stuff . " There must be ninety performances of it on tape , " Harris says . " But number twenty-six is no different from number eighty-five . " In comparison , " You Never Know " - a complex bundle of time signatures that is one of two new numbers on Busted Stuff - was written by Matthews , then arranged and cut by the band , in four days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Busted Stuff - essentially a brand-new Summer - is the best and quickest record the Dave Matthews Band has ever made , five weeks from first day to final mix . Of the band 's five studio albums , it is also the most faithful to the group 's unique live-show dynamics : the locked grip of Beauford 's rolling drums and Lessard 's pinpoint bass ; the way Tinsley 's iron-hummingbird flourishes and Moore 's strong , wise blowing , with its echoes of King Curtis and Hank Crawford , color and lift Matthews ' dusky voice . <p> Personally , though not musically , the Dave Matthews Band is a case study in disparity , a tremendously successful whole defined by remarkable differences in age , race and personal history . Beauford , who was born in Charlottesville , and Moore , who is forty and from Durham , North Carolina , were experienced jazz-fusion cats playing in Virginia clubs together while Matthews was bartending at Miller 's and Lessard was taking piano lessons in high school . Tinsley , 38 , and the band 's other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was twelve , and that was by mistake . " I wanted to be a guitar player , " he says with a gravelly laugh . " I signed up for this strings ' class in junior high , figuring a guitar had strings . It was an orchestra class . That 's how I started out - by not paying attention . " <p> " We did n't grow up playing in the mud together , " says Lessard , who is originally from Anaheim , California . And he had trouble , at first , adjusting to life on the road with much older musicians . " I had a pretty sheltered upbringing . When we pulled off the road to take a piss next to the van , I would be really worried , because I knew you were n't supposed to piss on the side of the road . <p> " It 's not that we 're not friends , " Lessard insists . But what you see on stage is " five completely different people pulling together to make something work . You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour , Matthews , Lessard , Tinsley , Moore and Beauford travel in separate buses - for comfort , to accommodate friends and family , and because they can afford it . Lessard says Beauford likes to split the venue immediately after the last note of the encore : " But I like to stay for at least an hour and hang with the crew , watch them load out . " <p> There is also the matter of the set list . ( In two nights at Shoreline Amphitheatre , the group played thirty-three different songs , repeating only two in the second concert . ) About a half-hour before showtime , Matthews writes a lineup of tunes , then gives it to monitor engineer Ian Kuhn , who makes a computer printout and runs it by Lessard and Beauford for comments . " Sometimes Stefan will send it back to me , and the whole order will be changed , " Matthews says . Tinsley and Moore are content to find out what 's on the menu at the last minute . " They just go , What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang out together the most is onstage , " says Tinsley in his San Francisco hotel room one afternoon , surrounded by remains of his room-service breakfast . " That 's the time . " All five members wear earpiece monitors during the show , and between songs Matthews often turns his back to the crowd , yakking and laughing with the others through a small microphone clipped to his shirt . " We 're just joking , " Tinsley says , " cutting each other down , pointing out some girl in the front row . The audience does n't know . It 's between us . <p> " It 's an unusual band , " he concedes , " one that is probably not supposed to work . Others look at it , see three black guys and two white guys , and wonder what the hell is going on . Not only that , there 's a violin and a saxophone . They 're seeing all these peripheral things . <p> " For us , " Tinsley goes on , " that shit was never important . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' If the music is there , everything else will be fine . " <p> THE SETTING IS PEACEFUL : A SMALL patio ringed with greenery , adjacent to the studio at the Plant in Sausalito , California , where the Dave Matthews Band recorded Busted Stuff . The subject is racism - what Matthews saw , how it touched him - during his life in South Africa . <p> Matthews was two years old when his family moved to the U.S. ; he became an American citizen at thirteen . But Matthews , who was raised in the Quaker faith , spent his high school years back in South Africa . His father , John , a physicist , died of lung cancer when Matthews was ten ; his mother , Val , a painter and architect , then returned with Matthews , his brother , Peter , and his sisters , Jane and Anne , to the far northern suburbs of Johannesburg . Matthews emigrated for good when he was nineteen - five years before the fall of apartheid - to avoid compulsory military service . ( Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some friends from the Quaker church at a retreat in this little Afrikaner town and going into an ice cream parlor , " he says , talking over the constant babble of a small fountain in one corner of the patio . " The people running the place said we could n't sit there because half of us were black . Then we thought about the language they used : You ca n't sit in here . ' " Matthews and the other white kids went back in and sat down ; their black friends perched in their laps . <p> " They served us , but we did n't stay long , " Matthews goes on . " We left and hoped we did n't get our heads kicked in . " <p> When asked if forming a mixed-race band was a reaction to his experiences in South Africa , Matthews thinks for a long moment , then replies , " I do n't know . " He will say that Beauford and Moore were two of the best musicians in Charlottesville , a university town rich in hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the C and O , where the entrance ran along a wall behind his drum kit . There was a small window in the wall , too , above Beauford 's head . " A lot of times , Dave would be peeping in , " Beauford says , " checking me out . I 'd turn around and go , Who 's this guy ? ' " <p> " I 'll tell you though , I sometimes have this anti-European thing inside me , " Matthews confesses , " which is crazy , because that 's what I am " - of Dutch-Irish descent on his father 's side and German on his mother 's . " I find myself feeling ashamed , although I 'm not responsible for history . " <p> He gives an example . " Years before we got together in the band , I knew LeRoi - he played at Miller 's a lot - and we used to get drunk together , sit at the bar and get into fights . <p> " Not serious ones , " he stresses , " just arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think a lot of it was that I was a white South African . That was often the topic of conversation - racism . " Matthews grins . " But we became good friends . " <p> Pressed on the issue of who really leads the band that bears his name , Matthews defers , at least in part , to Beauford . " I 'm the principal songwriter , " Matthews says . " I 'm singing things I came up with . But Carter was the one who spoke out that summer of the Lillywhite sessions and said , We need to change . ' I often choose not to speak my mind . I do that in every part of my life . " He shrugs . " That 's my shortcoming . But if Carter says we need to talk , we talk . " <p> Beauford says Tinsley was the frontman in the Dave Matthews Band 's club-and-frat-party days : " A lot of people thought Boyd Tinsley was Dave Matthews , because he was talking all the time . Dave never spoke at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he had to step up . We convinced him and told him that when he did speak to the crowd , make sure it was very little . Do n't give them a speech , just Thank you . ' " Eleven years later , that 's still pretty much what Matthews says , every fourth or fifth song each night . <p> On the patio in Sausalito , Matthews considers the magnitude of his success and the expectations dead ahead . He shivers slightly , and it 's not from the breeze . " I feel this is definitely a point of change , " he says . When the Dave Matthews Band 's summer tour ends on September 8th at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George , Washington , Tinsley will complete his forthcoming solo album . Lessard is writing songs on his own ; Beauford is interested in scoring films . RCA 's Flohr says he 's waiting " for LeRoi to say when he 's got a window open , so I can use him on every session we do . I would have that guy blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthews has no plans other than to keep writing songs at his current home in Seattle , where Ashley is attending graduate school . ( He still has a big spread on the James River south of Charleston , on the same country road where Tinsley and Lessard live . ) " I 'm a bit apprehensive about making the wrong choices , " he admits . " That thought is always in the back of my head - Are we at the top ? Are we finished doing what we do ? ' <p> " But I 've never worked as hard at anything as I have with this , at all of us keeping this band together , " Matthews says proudly . " The important place the band holds in my heart - that is something I will never easily walk away from .
