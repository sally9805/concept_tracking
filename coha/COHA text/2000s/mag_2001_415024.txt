Because its foliage is not stiff , it forms a loose mound . It is n't recommended as an edging plant because it spreads aggressively and will quickly grow into turf areas and flowerbeds . It works well in large beds as a ground cover , where weeds have a hard time competing with it . Liriope thrives in a moist , fertile , well-drained soil and will take sun or shade .

They make a nice sweep of green in the landscape and can be used as a low-maintenance lawn substitute . They excel under trees where many turf grasses struggle .

Space liriope 8 to 10 inches apart and mondo grass 4 to 6 inches apart . Large plantings should be put out in a gridlike pattern . If the soil is loose and you water and fertilize periodically , they should mesh tightly together in a couple of years . Mulch new plantings with finely shredded bark . Bark keeps weeds out and moisture in . It also allows stolons to move under the mulch so plants can spread . Try one of these can't-miss ground covers . Do n't limit them to just edging sidewalks and driveways . Plant them en masse or where your grass wo n't grow . You really have nothing to lose-they thrive on neglect . <p>
