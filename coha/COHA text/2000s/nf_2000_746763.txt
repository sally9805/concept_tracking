Part 1 : Cultural and Intellectual Contexts <p> Of all the policy issues that come to us in K-12 arts education , one of the most vexing arises from the tremendous confusion that many people seem to have about the nature and use of intellect in the arts . Some of this confusion arises from disciplinary territorializing in higher education , some from conditions in contemporary culture , and some from disparate goals in the arts community itself . The purpose of this two-part article is to discuss this condition , along with other dilemmas , what may lie behind them , and how they may be addressed . I want to assume that both in the contemplation of the arts ( thinking about ) and in the doing of them ( thinking in ) , intellectual engagement is of the essence . I want to argue that both kinds of intellectual engagement , but especially first of the two , have little value unless they find their source in making art , not just contemplating it . Most of the time I shall be focusing on music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am comfortable with this because underneath any number of distinctions among the arts lie deeper things that unify . In fact , as I think about who we are , how we were created , and what we are capable of , I can not help believing that all disciplines are dialects of one another . If I am correct in this , I have no doubt that the practitioners of the other arts will sense appropriate connections with what I am saying about music and proceed from there . All along , I want to assume that a thoroughgoing approach to arts education will provide the ordinary artistic instinct owned by all people with a reason for a particular kind of whole engagement in the arts themselves that in turn deeply engages and develops many dimensions of the intellect . Speech Logic Exclusivism : Education 's Intellectual Shortfall <p> Education policy discussions often reflect a split between the arts and the liberal arts , or between performance-based and humanities-based arts education . Those who are committed to the idea that words and numbers are the primary , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want to understand that the worlds of still and moving images and of abstract sounds , pitches , and textures are fertile areas for the application of intellectual technique . Likewise , those who are the actual practitioners in the arts do not take the time or cultivate the ability to show , from the inside out , how intellectual action is an intrinsic part of making and performing art . <p> With the exception of mathematics , some of the sciences , and the arts ( including drama , for larger reasons than its artistic use of words ) , all other academic disciplines rely almost exclusively on speech logic as their explicative medium . Consequently , a vast majority in education have seen to it that speech logic is the predominant discursive form . After basic skills development , math logic becomes the province of specialists ; thus , higher mathematics is not a regular form of public discourse . Speech logic is , and it works admirably when one worded artifact is used to inquire into , and make connections with , another worded artifact , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet other thoughts from many fields as long as words are the primary discursive form used to effect the linkage . The academic intellect has become so locked into this approach that two things have resulted . <p> First , discursive forms that do not use words are thought not to be equally or accurately discursive , and therefore are thought to be incapable of intellectual content or encounter on their own terms . Second , while there may be an acknowledgment on the part of some educators that forms of discourse outside of speech logic may in fact have intellectual content and intrinsic meaning , the majority are either loath or too lazy to learn the forms so as to think in them . Consequently , they feel intellectually vindicated encountering other discursive forms only through the use of words , and if something can not be said with words , it must not contain anything of intellectual substance . It is relegated , in short , to another domain in which intellect is not at issue . However sophisticated , wide-ranging , and probing this thinking about may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking in . <p> This focus on speech logic combined with the symbolic power of scientific-sounding terminology may be one of the primary reasons why we are so much a culture of analysis and theory : analysis of and theories both of and about . But learning to do analysis of and theory about do not guarantee at all that we become conversant in . I once asked a highly respected philosopher if it was possible to construct a philosophy of art , including an aesthetic theory , without going to art museums or attending concerts . His immediate response was , " Of course . " He was essentially saying that it is possible to intellectualize about something without necessarily having to have actual experiences in it . Meanwhile , the result would satisfy the demands of the discipline even though it would perpetuate , even validate , the distance from practice that thinking about so much subsists on . This difference between practices about and practices in can lead to any number of analogies that , outside of the arts , prove how shortsighted this approach is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory work ; a medical student can learn anatomy without going into the dissecting room ; one can intellectualize about fine wines without developing a tasting for them ; one can work out an ethical theory without binding oneself to live by or in it ; one can be painstakingly taught to memorize and replicate , thus perform , the sounds of French poetry without learning to think in French . Parenthetically , the learning of French or any of the usual languages required of a liberal arts education often lends only a semblance of linguistic otherness to the curriculum . It can be merely an extension of the speech logic compulsion and often bears no resemblance whatsoever to learning in a truly different way of imagining and crafting with intellectual technique in a variety of logics . What we have , in this institution of about-ness , is a heap of abstractions that do not integratively apply , that lie outside of the real practice of the very things around which the abstractions are constructed . The irony is that no thinking educator would ever allow such disjunctions to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , for far too many , having information about would suffice . <p> At base , thinking about and thinking in are an infinity removed from each other . Although it is possible to think about music or art with words , or to use philosophical concepts and techniques about music in musical decision making , it is impossible to think in philosophy with the discursive forms of music , musical concepts , and techniques . The typical academician would certainly accept the former possibility but would take umbrage if told to do the latter . This same academician , however , appears to feel quite comfortable with limiting the world of musical and artistic thought to an outside discursive form , namely words . With due respect and equal candor , one can only say that such people are less than liberally educated . Yet they claim to be imparting a liberal arts education to the majority of America 's college educated populace , and putting the conceptual touches to the professional education of America 's public school teachers . <p> This intellectual shortfall can only be termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if one form of discourse were superior to the inherency of another , but it is studded with disenfranchisement , as if other forms of discourse were not welcomed . Were the classical concepts about liberal arts learning  --  its orthodoxy  --  to be seriously and fully lived out  --  its orthopraxy  --  a very simple but revolutionary shift would result : All disciplines would be studied and practiced in their indigenous discursive forms . Therefore , thinking in would precede and inform thinking about , and all people educated in this way would have earned the right to a historically elegant cultural station , namely amateurism , and only in this wide-ranging literacy would their special calling be validated . Serious and sincere educators and policymakers must wake up to this shortfall , this exclusivism , and bend every effort to welcome all forms of creative discourse into the circle of intellectual thought . In the arts , this can be accomplished only through intellectually informed experiences in the making and performing of art . Musical Experience and Experientialism <p> We are rightly said to be living in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . It would be wrong , for example , to speak of any human event or a sequence of them in this or any other time as if it were not partly or wholly an experience . Throughout history we have regularly and justifiably talked about things like religion , cuisine , sport , art , marriage , child rearing , and education as experiences . Even the word " driven " may be insufficient to describe the way we presently behave because it is just as risky to say that experience is not an important driving force in the doing of anything in any society . Hence we need to clarify what meaning might be attached to " experience . " <p> A true , or full experience is something we so completely go through that it can be described in multiple ways and from different perspectives , each of which is incomplete without the others . It is a synthesis , a balanced composite in which " experience " in the contemporary sense is but one segment . There is a comprehensiveness to it that , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have life and to participate in the civilization that brings shape , value , and style to our living . It is how we define these experiences or what we include in them that shows balance or imbalance , narrowness or width in the way we live . In other words , our view of experience is an exegesis of our world view . <p> To have a culinary experience in the fullest sense , then , is to experience a fullness ( no pun here ) beyond mere eating . It is to savor , to taste and see beyond the immediate delights of an expertly prepared and presented meal , further into the manifold history , generosity , and richness of the higher things of a culture . It is to be nurtured beyond nutrition . Or , we can eat and experience a short-lived sensation , a good one we hope , but short-lived and self-enclosed . This , too , is an experience but not a complete one . It is a feeling that comes simply of having eaten and having enjoyed the taste . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , or experiences , that make up our living and if each is short-lived and self-enclosed , we are drawing closer to the idea of an experience-driven culture in the contemporary sense . But there is one more step . These short-lived and self-enclosed events are summed up in feelings . This is what I would call experientialism : short-lived immediacies and satisfactions driving a world view , and this is what I mean when I critique the idea that we live in an experience-driven culture . <p> In the world of commerce , experientialism is transposed into advertising and selling : creating immediacies and offering satisfaction . The church of late sees itself providing " experiences " in worship ( the latter often described as a mood or an attitude ) . The hard edges of doctrine are rounded off into expressivism and meeting " felt needs . " In a disturbing way , " seeker friendliness " is the ecclesiastical counterpart to market research . The educational world has one foot in the boat and the other on the dock as it markets what it calls experiential learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not itself an experience . With feelings , immediacies , and satisfaction floating around everywhere , our language dutifully adjusts . " Unique " and its newfound comparatives  --  rather unique , almost unique , quite unique  --  are used to commend the experiencing of anything from an omelet to a spiritual encounter . Church sanctuaries are renamed " encouragement centers . " If we say thank you , we feel relieved to know that , after all , it was " no problem . " <p> And we must go on , directly to music , for this art form has become the centerpiece of a culture given over to short-lived , self-enclosed feeling . More will be said about music and culture in another section , but here we concentrate on the fact that music 's usefulness is posited far more on how it feels than what it substantively is . Nor should we think that this happens only in popular music . Any kind of music that becomes popular , for whatever length of time , does so in direct proportion to its ability to vibrate with  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . It does not matter whether there is a significant intellectual expenditure on the part of the composer or performer in bringing the music about , for there is no desire on the part of the consumer to engage with the music in that way . To think through a piece of music is unnecessary when it provides its own affective lubricant . If intellectual content does exist , it is ignored because , after all , music is feeling ; it is experience ; it is to be enjoyed this way ; therefore , its ability to bring satisfaction is its own justification : " The music makes me feel a certain way I can identify with it , and if it does n't make me feel a certain way , then it 's not my music . " There is very little attempt to widen the inquiry or to extend the curiosity . The upshot is that " experience , " countermands experience . <p> This brings us to a statement about music that , in one guise or another , has been around for years : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind . " It can be found in more sophisticated forms in philosophical thought , both as praise and warning . It has been a strategic point of reference in the church , at least since Augustine , prompting many to question music 's use ( or overuse ) due to its seeming ability to hold direct sway over those who might not yet be spiritually capable of handling such sway . At the same time , it has been used by ecclesiastical behaviorists to move the sinner to repentance and the faithful to worship . Those in the secular world who take the quick fix approach to music therapy bank on this same perspective . <p> The educational problem with the belief that music bypasses the mind is that it contains a half-truth . Music of any kind is powerfully affective and speaks easily to the emotions . Notice I did not say " directly to the emotions . " Those who say that music appeals directly to the emotions more than imply that the mind is not connected to the emotions . This is a major metaphysical error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps trichotomizing the human being into disparately functioning layers of mind and spirit , or body , mind , and spirit-three peas in a pod or three ball bearings in a cup . The question , of course , is one of identifying and describing the pod or the cup , in that the two or three entities seem so complete in themselves . Those who acknowledge categories of body , mind , and spirit must make a choice between trichotomy or unity , one in which separate categories are mystically juxtaposed , or one that espouses the paradox of unity-in-distinction and distinction-in-unity . Doing this brings something like " emotional response " or " intellectual engagement " into conversation with and under the scrutiny of the whole , while each part of the whole scrutinizes each of the others . We can thus concentrate on the wholeness of what it means to be uniquely human . Contrary to the contemporary blight of " experience " countermanding experience , experience now broadens experience . The difference is obvious : the first is reductionism , the second , synergism . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perceived to bypass the mind ; and if intellectual action is reserved only for word-based or mathematics-based theoretical and analytical corners of a culture , then it follows rather easily that intellectual engagement with music will either be dismissed as a silliness or reserved for those who have chosen to intellectualize about it , including intellectualizing about its lack of intellectual substance . This is certainly the case in our culture , and to the extent that it is , all connections between musical creator and music receiver are de-intellectualized . The educational policy implications of this severing are enormous . The Intellectual Humility of Music <p> In part 2 , I will talk more particularly about how the making and performance of music depend heavily on the forceful use of intellect . Until then , we can allow this assumption to stand : Music , on its own , can demand significant intellectual prowess and can contain intellectually deep content . Given this , the question arises as to why this prowess and depth , this music logic , is not more easily recognized or is so easily put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ways that full experience has been culturally narrowed to mere pleasure . But when we look into music itself , irrespective of this present cultural flaw , we recognize that , in a peculiar respect , it may lend a hand in creating the very problem under discussion . Music may be its own worst enemy . <p> How ? Simply this way : It is in the very nature of music ( and to varying degrees , other art forms ) so to hide its intellectual processes and procedures that a listener can still experience aesthetic satisfaction without having a working knowledge of what they have missed . A relatively untrained listener can engage more than superficially in the unfolding of a sonata-rondo form , a procedurally complex fugue , a metamorphically subtle jazz improvisation , without knowing how to follow the structural grammars and the development of ideas , or how to bring definition to the unique design that results therefrom . At the same time , highly trained listeners who know every procedural turn to a tee and who can listen with complete understanding can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilled by the same " over-and-aboveness " that strikes the uninitiated . Or , one can concentrate deeply for some of the time and then drift away , only to rejoin without paying a " listening " penalty for momentarily having lost their way . We can walk into the middle of a performance and , even though we would like to have listened to it from the beginning , be fulfilled by the remainder . <p> I believe it can be argued that , of all forms of human discourse and expression , great music can be the most intellectually " at work , " the most profound , the most complex , without forcing us to know that it is . Something is at work in this elusive artifact , down deep yet quickly at hand , where the mind can capture and the spirit can respond to final syntheses without knowledge of their inherent complexity . I believe that the intellectual content of great music may be so finessed by its sheer artfulness , its " over and aboveness , " that it can make one intellectually sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having the ability to follow in the musical equivalent of word-for-word unfolding . I truly believe that music , without letting up on its insistent demand to be fully understood , possesses a discursive graciousness , a redeeming humility , that gives the uninitiated a welcome that would not have been there in other forms of discourse . Finally , in this gracious giving of itself , in the way it subtly befriends the mind , in its superb way of delighting us with some of human creativity 's most intricate and balanced designs , music can bring a sense of completion to those who do n't understand it fully  --  only to add to its completion ( as paradoxical as this may sound ) the more one 's understanding increases . This is what I can only call the intellectual humility of music  --  I might even go so far as to call it the innocence of music . I do not think I exaggerate in this , nor am I trying to create a false pretense for what some may call an intellectually soft art form . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It opens the way for unscrupulousness and quick-fix sonic pleasure , for intellectual banality , unabashed kitsch and mediocrity-for content without substance and contrivances without depth . It opens the way for the critics to come back with the old saw that if music can go straight to the emotions without engaging the intellect , why be so concerned with intellectualism ? And of course it allows the speech and numbers advocates to return to their shelters with doubled satisfaction and renewed provincialism . And it finally allows them to exercise their intellects in continued thoughts about music , as if by so doing to impute to it some sort of academic citizenship . <p> This humility and graciousness toward the uninformed is but one part of the reward of music . The reward is at least doubled for the trained listener , the completely informed performer , or anyone in the process of becoming one . It can be put this way : The receiving intellect ( re-creative listening ) , the performing intellect ( creative re-presentation ) , and the composer 's intellect ( creative initiation ) are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity can not exist outside of the making of music , and the making of music is not complete if is but two-sided : composer and performer . It must include the listener for whom an educational process must be developed in which intellectually informed performing is at the center . Being at work in music thus precedes and surrounds being at work about music . This premise is just as important for the musicologist , the philosopher of the arts , and the music critic , as it is for the amateur . Popular Culture and the Intellect <p> Here is one way of talking about popular culture : It is a succession and intersection of quickly popular things that have short-lived popularity . The culture in which these things are embedded is simply a point of view that validates this given-time popularity ; what may be popular in the culture now , may not be in a month , or even fifteen minutes from now . It is quite difficult , therefore , to define popular culture by what may be " in " at a given time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the cultural scene for awhile , enough to become our wedding march du jour , does not mean that contemporary mass culture is undergoing a shift to the things of high culture or that intellectual aspirations are increasing . It means that there is something in this composition that , for a while , hits on the contemporary receptors and equates somehow with other likenesses that titillate the same receptors , whether they come from Tibet or Austin , Texas . The resurgence of interest in chant , of all things , has less to do with a cultural desire to reunite with older ecclesiastical traditions , moral chastity , self-denial , and the classical connections to masses , motets , and Christian worship , than with an overarching union of cultural minimalism and New Age spirituality that , for a limited time , chooses to vibrate with this splendid , millennium-removed artifact . ( None of the foregoing is meant to imply , however , that those in control of consumerism  --  the gatekeepers  --  do not have a plan . They do . It is ruthless in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk that the consumer is given the feeling that he or she has actually done the choosing . ) <p> Popular culture can also mean the kind of culture that , irrespective of content , presently is the dominant culture compared with other kinds that could be , could have been , or once were . It is a massive set of choices , complete in itself , possessing its comprehensive ways that , in their fullness , are seen as a negation , an improvement , a paraphrasing , or a coalition of choices . Depending on one 's point of view , our contemporary popular culture is any one of these . <p> For those who hold to a traditional view of ethics , morals , hierarchical systems , and classical thoroughness , mass popular culture is a negation . It is doing away with , or has done away with , the best that a culture can offer and is giving little or nothing in return . Those who hold this view may be right ( and I am among them ) . But we must take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that make up the worst cultures . The seeds of one are in the fruits of another . The difference may lie only in a culture 's possession of a set of central values and protocols that clearly speak for the good and against the bad . <p> For those who take issue with the high view and prefer a free-ranging consortium of relativities  --  moral , ethical , and artifactual  --  this culture of relativity is an improved culture . There are laws and there are values , but they are infinitely interpretable and , through the application of legal and hermeneutical technique , can be manipulated to justify a wide range of choices . This is a culture in which side-by-side anomalies can coexist without fear of suppression . ( Well , at least it appears that way . ) However , such a culture can be steered one way or another not on the basis of principle but on who wields the power . Those who begin by applauding the freedom and easiness of choice soon find themselves buried in a melange of competing power plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to learn that free-ranging relativity is the very laboratory for its opposite-creeping absolutism and variegated fundamentalism . <p> Those who see one culture as a paraphrase of another might say that popular culture ( with its own vocabularies for good and bad , right and wrong ) is simply a popularized variation on classicism ( with its particular vocabularies for the same ) and be content with the implied return of the classical . What goes around comes around . The trouble with this is that paraphrase implies stasis . Nothing really changes ; we simply depend on alternate ways of saying the same thing . Those who see the present culture as a coalition of other massive choices lace their talk with globalism , multiculturalism , diversity , and the world as a family . They overlook a startling reality : Except through a centralized creation of cultural esperanti ( the " in " word for this is " fusion " ) it is impossible to create a global economy through the efforts of big business , to create a global village through the efforts of socio-theologians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . Masking this reality falls to the creation of politically correct choices imposed on the whole so as to give the semblance of agreement and coalition . So far , these choices have only resulted in new prejudices , new separations , caricatures , and false stylizations . We still bash and we still coddle ; we have just created new objects for coddling ( " other " cultures , choice , feminism , for instance ) and bashing ( Western culture , choice , and masculinity , for instance ) . Another phrase for this arrangement is " fundamentalist liberalism . " <p> Any or all of the above comes under the scrutiny and critique of the prescriptivists and the descriptivists . The prescriptivists , many of whom see the present culture as a negation , possess a cultural ideal that serves a protest point . It calls for a working synthesis of intellectual probity , aesthetic depth , moral and ethical centeredness , simplicity and complexity , and protracted attention at the expense of easy gratification . At its best , this ideal is teacherly , conservative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly blue-nosed , arrogant , and judgmental . It can hide prejudice under aesthetic one-upmanship and moral naysaying . It can dichotomize classical and popular , or high and low , by forgetting that , at their best , both are participants in a creative continuum , and each can join in the quest for excellence . It shows itself in a kind of academic aloofness and in a confusion of greatness with pastness , to the extent that anything contemporary is treated as suspect . We can call this negative side fundamentalist conservatism . <p> The descriptivists are the scientists ( particularly the social and behavioral scientists ) and the pollsters . The best of them use their craft and their sciences to tell us what present culture is , to diagnose what may be wrong with it , and to offer wisely crafted help in its healing . But many of them misuse their craft by going beyond description and assistance into pulpitry by implying that because culture is this way it should really be that way ; or , in an individualist variant , implying that , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall use my science to promote my agenda . Words Powerful and Powerless <p> Given these possibilities and conjectures , and given the possibility that contemporary culture may be a Babel of all of these voices at once , a more helpful approach might be to outline three crucial and interrelated issues that rise above these different cultural models . Taken together , they suggest that there is something radically wrong  --  that art , words , intellect , education , and the relationships among them are all in trouble . <p> The first issue is the diminution , if not death of , a reverence for words and for their careful placement within an idea and its articulation . This condition can not be fully understood without the recognition that the loss of a moral center , a truth center , allows us to use words not only untruthfully , but with abject carelessness . While speech logic exclusivism denotes intellectual provincialism , speech logic neglect denotes intellectual banality . Between politics ( for which language is adjusted to fit any socio-moral situation ) , the advertising industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and moral relativism ( for which language is its deconstructed lackey ) , there is virtually no forum in which a consistent working respect for this fragile but central medium is in evidence . <p> " Awesome " now describes anything from a pizza to an orgasm to a vision of the Lord . " Excellence " usually means any one of three things : perfection , profitability and winning , or mere ordinariness relabeled . We have stripped our superlatives of their moral , ethical , and aesthetic majesty , thanks to politics , advertising , and postmodernism . If we lose our superlatives , having failed to reserve them for uniqueness , and if just about anything is now " rather unique , " then what do " good " and " goodness " mean ? What then is " average , " given our tendency to make everyone " special " ? If a standing ovation is now the norm for virtually any public performance , must we take wing to remark on uniqueness ? <p> I now move to the second issue , and it ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficially give the impression that I am turning my back on the previous comments about speech logic exclusivism and the intellectual humility of music . But I hope to make a different kind of point , and I hope the reader you will see it . The demise in the art and craft of speech logic has left a discursive vacuum for which musico-visual communication seems to be the replacement . George Steiner , as early as 1972 , prophetically said that music has become the new literacy of Western civilization , and many other more recent commentators have made parallel statements . It is now music that galvanizes , that does the speaking , that provides the gathering voice by which identities are forged and social groupings bonded . <p> It is one thing for people to be drawn together by a cultural wholeness of which music making is an evidence . It is quite another for music to be the determinant , the centripetal force , that subsumes instead of corroborates the whole . This inversion not only marks the secular side of culture , but a significant portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrament . It is the stylistic facilitator for worship . It is worship 's gathering force , instead of worship being the gathering force for it . People choose worship styles on the basis of musical style , which establishes group identity . Meeting needs is the behavioral answer to proclaiming truth , and music is the experiential " tool " ( a favorite word among worship leaders ) to facilitate the whole . Hence music is looked to for what it can bring about instead of being a witness to what only God can bring about . The words accompanying the music ( for that is what they now do ) have suffered the same fate as in secular culture . Careless choices , exaggerations , imprecisions , mantra-like repetitions , and outright theological lapses are covered over and excused by the primacy of the musical experience . I realize I am spending more time speaking about the church than general culture . This is intentional and unavoidable . First , the parallels between the two are obvious . Thus , I could have shifted the emphasis to general culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions are historically held accountable for guiding all truth debates , for speaking up against wrong and living for what is right , and if these institutions sidestep those duties or devise culturally satisfying paraphrases of them , then it is not the culture that is finally to be condemned but the religious institutions . <p> Music is everywhere , and it seems that we can not do whatever makes up our work , our recreation , and even our rest , without it 's being somewhere : foreground , middle ground , or background . It is music  --  I do not think I exaggerate here  --  it is music that has become as much an addiction as the harder stuff against which we wage a legal , moral , and , to this point , a losing war . As with all addictive substances , more of it is needed , and then even more , to accomplish the same transient fix . The user becomes used by the substance . Again , I do not think I exaggerate in moving this phenomenon over to music . We seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompany , and even drive , the doing . The purveyors of music bend every ethic to convince us that this is right . Down to the very youngest of our children , music supervises the social , material , sexual , and spiritual growth curve of the masses . The only room for the intellect in this darkened scheme is in the analysis of the situation ( thinking about ) , and this can be done only from the outside and only in words , assuming that the ones who use the words still prize their beauty and precision . Otherwise , music and music-making remain mere functions of identity , need , feeling , and facilitation . Music itself is denied the intellectual pursuits called for by its own logic . <p> Third , our culture is marked by an overriding preference for shallowness and intellectual thinness . This is the obvious counterpart to the experientalism and language degradation already mentioned . Intellectual depth and popularity simply do not coincide . The deeper something is taken , the less popular it is liable to be . Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be examined as to how deep it can go . It is not that something should be rejected because it is popular ; that is simply one more form of snobbery . There are always times when the deep and the widely accepted consort admirably . Even shallowness , if it is rightly understood , has legitimacy and dignity to the extent that it participates in a reciprocating continuum : deep to shallow and shallow to deep . Thus , a culture that goes deep , as all high cultures certainly do , welcomes the kinship that simple and complex , immediate and gradual , ornamental and metamorphic , and even entertaining and engaging have with each other . <p> But the shallowness of contemporary mass culture is another matter . This kind becomes and remains its own widespread singularity . Hence there can be no graduation , no reciprocation , no growth , no increase of depth , nor for that matter , height . Transiency , trendiness , and fast change furnish the relief and serve as stand-ins for wholeness and creative maturity . Data flow substitutes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality , and episodic living for deepening continuity . Popular culture is much like staying the same age , continually having first birthday parties that are mere ornamentations of each other . <p> It is impossible to examine this issue of shallowness without returning to the subject of popular music  --  not that much of it is not serious and heartfelt ; not much of it is not truly well done and , in its way , creative . But it is shallow ; it is passing ; its styles and stars , with rare exception , come and go . They must , because shallowness does n't last . It needs its successors and , of course , the industry sees to it that its merchandise remains shallow enough to demand replacing . Otherwise we would not have a multibillion dollar industry , catching people , especially the young , by the purse strings at every turn . As to the lyrics , much is made of them and the meaning that they carry , how personal they are , how they strike this or that life 's chord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they appear deep , it is because , at best , they strike something that could be taken to a far deeper level . But do they do this , lastingly , and transcendently ? Almost never . Instead , they give off that embarrassingly kitschy seriousness and self-remarkability ; they have a first impression , catchword depth . They subsist on the personality-ridden , cultic sacramentalism of the music . Meantime , no little amount of brow-knit journalism is spent on the " meaningful relevance " of the lyrics of this music , the way it " sees down into things " , and reflects " the way it is , " speaking ever so knowingly for the young , who speak in return by spending and adulating , spending and adulating . <p> Here 's the tragedy : Our young people have been commercially degraded to the point where we actually believe they are intellectually and morally capable of very little . This is the worst kind of abuse imaginable , for it strikes at the very core of what the Judeo-Christian heritage calls imago dei , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created . To be given life this way is a profound mystery and a profound dignity . To be created this way means that even the most average person is capable of amazing reach and depth . But , as a success-driven culture , we reserve creativity for the gifted and craft for the average , failing to understand that , at any level , the two are inseparable . Despite all of the talk about what our young people ca n't do , we can only blame ourselves . But the truth is , in their present " condition , " they are truly hungry ; they truly reach out for and grapple with ideas , and they truly listen hard when faced with the kind of probing , comprehensive , humane , teacherly , and  --  above all  --  authoritative mentoring that marks our best parents and educators . Please note that I did not say " powerful " mentoring , for power is what this culture is riddled with , and it is power that we must dismiss from our ways . <p> But authority is another matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right rather than who is right . It issues out of the integrity of the idea rather than the force of the person articulating it . It refuses to manipulate and control and leaves room for thoughtful debate and choice . I am quite convinced that power perpetuates shallowness and forbids depth , otherwise power would not be power . Totalitarianism , in all its forms , quenches depth at any cost , for it is depth that sees into truth , applies the truth , and welcomes the shallow in order to deepen it . Once again , I do not think I exaggerate when I say that the shallowness of this culture has been repressingly brought on and perpetuated by those who have the power , whether it is political , commercial , ecclesiastical , or pedagogical . And once again , I say that the grief being done to our young by a culture of shallowness-a culture of pretended depth created by political , educational , and commercial pretenders-should cause everyone who has ever been near a child 's mind to bend over with sadness and anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have not led to the demise of intellectual thought as much as they have relegated it to two narrow and disparate operational corners . The first of these is truly consistent with itself . It entails deep thought about both the simplicity of depth and the depth of simplicity , whatever the art form , discipline , or field of study . It is elegance about elegance , wisdom about wisdom , beauty about beauty , and integrity about integrity . It understands that finely articulated linkages and syntheses can be forged out of deep likenesses ; it treats anomalies as violations rather than excusable relativities . It also sees mystery as mystery ; it is not wearied reaching for the transcendent ; it is thus unafraid to invoke faith and awe while standing ethically firm and socially decent . It sees the difference between using and enthroning reason , thus allowing itself glorious room for unlimited imagination partnered with order and discipline . This is high culture ; there is no other phrase for it , past , present , or future ; this is civilization at its struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that presses in on the contemporary scene , this civilizing remnant is vibrant and truly with us . There is more of it than we think ; otherwise there would be no Thomas Cahills , no Cormac McCarthys , no Bernard Haitinks , no Keith Jarretts , no Martha Grahams , no C. S. Lewises , no Andrew Wyeths , no Einojuhani Rautavaaras , no great orchestras or libraries or art galleries . <p> Whereas in a classical culture one can sense numerous procedural , ethical , and aesthetic connections running back and forth between low and high culture , that is not the case today . Hence the tragedy lies not only in high culture 's exile , but in the absence of an intellectual , aesthetic , and moral highway between it and the massive , self-enhancing , self-congratulating popular culture . True , some connections have been attempted , one through the relativizing grid of deconstruction and another through the rhetoric of an incomplete multiculturalism . Deconstruction ( and postmodernism ) are attractive intellectual toys because they do not call for any centering devices . Speech logic can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no speech logic . Intellectualism outruns itself in avoiding any commitment to absolutes and certainties . As to multiculturalism , it is woefully lacking because , as we know , its politically corrected version can not abide the notion of a high culture . There is a fundamental fear that the abrupt reality of human creativity , and the unequal show of it from individual to individual and culture to culture , might cut into the rhetoric of empowerment and rights . <p> It is in the second operational corner that we see a subtle breakdown . Here , high culture and mass popular culture bed down with each other without so much as a blink , in that the intellectual and scholarly apparatuses of the former lend intellectual credibility to the latter . This is what I mean . I believe that any fair reading of cultural history would reveal that academia , the academic intellect , and its scholarly enterprises would not be possible without the steadying ethos of high culture . ( Without bogging down in the question of which could have caused which , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is high culture that both demands intellectual work and grants the privilege of deliberative time , as well as the protocols , the materials , and the means for analyzing , contextualizing , critiquing , praising , conjecturing , and creating . Hence we have bodies of extraordinary scholarship for all the disciplines , including the arts . <p> So far so good . Until the almost concurrent beginnings of the discipline of ethnomusicology and the emergence of popular culture studies , musical scholarship was given almost entirely over to the study of music of high culture . Musical scholarship involved scholarly depth addressing creative and re-creative depth , or deep thought about based on deep thought in . Again , so far so good . While the pure subject of ethnomusicology is beyond the scope of this article , I think it fair to say two things . The discipline of ethnomusicology addresses high culture in non-Western traditions , but it is also dedicated to the study of folk and ethnic music ; thus scholarly depth is given over to the creative and re-creative actions of cultures and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between shallow and deep , high and low , or popular and classical . In this sense , ethnomusicology can rightly be called deep thought about based on creative fullness in . <p> But the world of music scholarship no longer stops here . While using the same intellectual , scholarly , and research tools that are devoted to the study of the music of high culture , a significant community of scholars now devotes its thought to the music of a culture that has virtually eliminated the life of the intellect from its operating center . Even so , the presence and the quality of the analysis , the thinking about , bring a seriousness and stature to it that it would not otherwise have . After all , mass culture is being studied ; it is being taken seriously ; it does join the Bachs and the Stravinskys and the Palestrinas , for they , too , have been seriously studied . This kind of credentialing , of course , satisfies the multiculturalists for whom qualitative differences are not an allowable issue . It also creates enough connective tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of inquiry , and to study the " further ramifications " of Americanized and commercially hyped packages of " world " and " ethnic " music . <p> To sum up , it is the formalized thinking about in all of its variants that brings deep thought and intellectual perception into an alliance with self-perpetuating shallowness . Intellectualizing can remain its own high art form in spite of the object of its inquiries . And as has been previously stated , this kind of thought simply perpetuates the substitution of thinking about for thinking in , except that now there is an intellectual distance of an entirely different order between the two . We are left with the alternatives of thinking deeply about shallow things or thinking deeply about the complexity of all things  --  shallow to deep , that is  --  until some greening rain falls on us all and brings depth back into conversation with valuing , and valuing with cherishing , and cherishing with excelling . Conclusion <p> The previous analysis , even if only partially complete or accurate , shows the tremendous challenge arts education faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of forces with vast cultural power that promote and reinforce the confusion that many people seem to have about the nature and use of intellect in the arts . This confusion has taken its toll on arts education policy . In briefest form these forces are the following : A belief that speech logic and in some settings , math logic , are the exclusive means of discourse about the arts A consequent division between thinking about the arts and thinking in the arts , prompting a formal division between humanities-based and performance-based arts education The natural tendency of the arts , and particularly music , to hide even the deepest intellectual content , thus prompting many to assume that it can not be important An experientialist mass culture with music as its center , preempting both the value of comprehensive experiences and the wise placement of the arts within them The demise of a reverence for words and their careful choice in the articulation of ideas The loss of a moral and spiritual centeredness that further compromises intellectual activity and allows the mechanisms of the advertising industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given-time popularity , governed by commercial gatekeepers that substitute for deliberation , deep content , and intellectual thought A minority high culture , cornered but vibrant , that continues to thrive and to lend warning and wisdom to an otherwise darkened society A scholarly presence of deep thought about shallow things that vicariously grants intellectual credibility to that which may have none of its own <p> These problems are not insurmountable , but they do require careful sorting of what is going on in the culture at large . There is an emerging hope that arts educators are finding an opening . Seizing the opportunity means doing at least three things : ( a ) creating a conceptual base for the integration of speech logic and the logics of music and the other arts ; ( b ) giving primary recognition to the immense intellectual content of the arts themselves so that intellectual work about the arts is seen as a consequence or analog , not a substitute ; ( c ) insisting on work in the arts as a primary means of arts education . <p> In part 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following questions : <p> What is intellect and what is artistic mindedness ? How are music making and performing intellectual ? What is creativity ? How do imagination and craft work together ? To what extent is musical perform ance creative ? What are the benefits of a complete music ( and arts ) education ? How can we turn speech logic to our own advantage in arts education and instruction ? <p> By Harold M. Best <p> <p> Harold M.
