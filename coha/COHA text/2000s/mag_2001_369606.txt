If things get really bad , Bill Clinton may think about blaming some of his fund-raising problems on Franklin Roosevelt . After all , it was F.D.R. who started the trend toward big-time presidential libraries that has Clinton trying to raise $150 million to build his center in Little Rock , Ark . Before F.D.R. , the most your typical President could look forward to was a shack with a plaque . When he left office , he held on to his papers . But F.D.R. , who invented the modern presidency , also invented the modern presidential library . In 1939 he bequeathed his papers to the government and donated part of his Hyde Park , N.Y. , estate for a library . In 1955 , Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act , which created a public-private partnership : an ex-President would raise money to build his library , but Washington would pick up most of the tab for maintaining the documents housed there . ( This year the Federal Government will spend about $38 million on the libraries . ) Subsequent acts guaranteed that such documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource , " says L.B.J. biographer Robert Dallek . <P> Today there are 10 presidential libraries , not counting the still disputed Nixon papers , which are housed in a suburban Washington warehouse , and Clinton 's planned facility . But the library is now just part of a former President 's operation . Attached to the libraries are privately funded museums and foundations . These have become minor tourist attractions ( presidential libraries combined get some 2 million visitors annually ) and , in some cases , major employment programs for the ex-Presidents ' pals . Because the presidency keeps getting bigger , so do the libraries . Gerald Ford 's library has more documents than F.D.R. 's . No wonder Presidents leave office with a tin cup in hand . " They 've become mendicants in some ways , " says a presidential-library official . L.B.J. got the Texas legislature to help fund his ; George Bush received $1 million each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait . And Clinton is hoping to hustle contributions well north of $1 million a pop .
