Chapter One ASK A SILLY QUESTION ART THEFT , OF COURSE , " SAID THE ELEGANT MAN , " HAS BEEN overdone . By now it 's thoroughly boring . " Dortmunder did n't say anything . His business was theft , of art or whatever else had value , and he 'd never supposed it was meant to be exciting . Nor , while tiptoeing around darkened halls in guarded buildings with his pockets full of stolen goods , had he ever found boredom much of a problem . The elegant man sighed . " What do people of your sort drink ? " he asked . " Bourbon , " Dortmunder said . " Water . Coca-Cola . Orange juice . Beer . " " Bourbon , " the elegant man told one of the two plug-uglies who 'd brought Dortmunder here . " And sherry for me . " " Coffee , " Dortmunder went on . " Sometimes Gallo Burgundy . Vodka . Seven-Up . Milk . " " How do you prefer your bourbon ? " the elegant man asked . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi-C , Scotch , lemonade , Nyquil- " " Do you drink Perrier ? " " No , " said Dortmunder . " Ah , " said the elegant man , closing the subject with his preconceptions intact . " Now , " he said , " I suppose you 're wondering why we all gathered you here . " " I got an appointment uptown , " Dortmunder answered . He was feeling mulish . When a simple walk to the subway turns into an incident with two plug-uglies , a gun in the back , a shoving into a limousine outfitted with liveried chauffeur beyond the closed glass partition , a run up the stocking of Manhattan to the East Sixties , a swallowing up into a town house with a garage with an electronically operated door , and an interview at gunpoint with a tall , slender , painfully well-dressed , 60ish , white-haired , white-mustached elegant man in a beautifully appointed and very masculine den imported intact from Bloomingdale 's , a person has a right to feel mulish . " I 'm already late for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to be brief , " the elegant man promised . " My father- who , by the way , was once Secretary of the Treasury of this great land , under Teddy Roosevelt-always impressed upon me the wisdom of obtaining expert advice before undertaking any project , of whatever size or scope . I have always followed that injunction . " " Uh-huh , " said Dortmunder . " The exigencies of life having made it necessary for me , " the elegant man continued , " to engage for once in the practice of grand larceny , in the form of burglary , I immediately sought out a professional in the field to advise me . You . " " I reformed , " Dortmunder said . " I made some mistakes in my youth , but I paid my debt to society and now I 'm reformed . " " Of course , " said the elegant man . " Ah , here are our drinks . Come along , I have something to show you . " It was a dark and lumpy statue , about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains and sitting on a tree trunk . " Beautiful , is n't it ? " the elegant man said , gazing fondly at the thing . Beauty was outside Dortmunder 's visual spectrum . " Yeah , " he said , and looked around this subterranean room , which had been fitted out like a cross between a den and a museum . Bookcases alternated with paintings on the walls , and antique furniture shared the polished wood floor with statuary , some on pedestals , some , like this bronze of a young girl , on low platforms . Dortmunder and the elegant man and the armed plug-uglies had come down here by elevator : apparently , the only route in and out . There were no windows and the air had the flat blanketlike quality of tight temperature and humidity control . " It 's a Rodin , " the elegant man was saying . " One of my wiser acquisitions , in my youth . " His mouth forming a practiced moue , he said , " One of my less wise acquisitions , more recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming my wife . " " I really got an appointment uptown , " Dortmunder said . " More recently still , " the elegant man persisted , " we came to a particularly bitter and unpleasant parting of the ways , Moira and I. As a part of the resulting settlement , the little bitch got this nymph here . But she did n't get it . " " Uh-huh , " Dortmunder said . " I have friends in the art world , " the elegant man went on , " and all men have sympathizers where grasping ex-wives are concerned . Several years earlier , I 'd had a mold made of this piece , and from it an exact copy had been cast in the same grade of bronze . A virtually identical copy ; not quite museum quality , of course , but aesthetically just as pleasing as the original . " " Sure , " said Dortmunder . " It was that copy I gave to Moira ; having , of course , first bribed the expert she 'd brought in to appraise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave her with scarcely a murmur , but my nymph ? Never ! " " Ah , " said Dortmunder . " All was well , " the elegant man said . " I kept my nymph , the one and only true original from Rodin 's plaster form , with the touch of the sculptor 's hand full upon it . Moira had the copy , pleased with the thought of its being the original , cheered by the memory of having done me in the eye . A happy ending for everyone , you might have said . " " Uh-huh , " said Dortmunder . " But not an ending at all , unfortunately . " The elegant man shook his head . " It has come to my attention , very belatedly , that tax problems have forced Moira to make a gift of the Rodin nymph to the Museum of Modern Art . Perhaps I ought to explain that even I can not with any certainty bribe an appraiser from the Museum of Modern Art . " " He 'll tell , " Dortmunder said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underworld , " the elegant man said , " spill the beans . " " That is n't the argot of the underworld , " Dortmunder told him . " No matter . The point is , my one recourse , it seems to me , is to enter Moira 's town house and make off with the copy . " " Makes sense , " Dortmunder agreed . The elegant man pointed at his nymph . " Pick that up , " he said . Dortmunder frowned , looking for the butcher 's thumb . " Go ahead , " the elegant man insisted . " It wo n't bite . " Dortmunder handed his bourbon and water to one of the plug-uglies ; then hesitant , unfamiliar with the process of lifting teenaged girls dressed in curtains-whether of bronze or anything else-he grasped this one by the chin and one elbow and lifted ... and it did n't move . " Uh , " said Dortmunder , visions of hernias blooming in his head . " You see the problem , " the elegant man said , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groin all quivered from the unexpected shock . " My nymph weighs five hundred twenty-six pounds . As does Moira 's copy , give or take a few ounces . " " Heavy , " agreed Dortmunder . He took back his drink and drank . " The museum 's expert arrives tomorrow afternoon , " the elegant man said touching his white mustache . " If I am to avoid discomfort-possibly even public disgrace-I must remove Moira 's copy from her possession tonight . " Dortmunder said , " And you want me to do it ? " " No , no , not at all . " The elegant man waved his elegant fingers . " My associates " - meaning the plug-uglies- " and I will , as you would say , pull the scam . " " That 's not what I 'd say , " Dortmunder told him . " No matter , no matter . What we wish from you , Mr. Dortmunder , is simply your expertise . Your professional opinion . Come along . " The elevator door opened to his elegant touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Fortunately , " the elegant man said , " I kept the architect 's plans and models even though I lost the town house itself to Moira . " Dortmunder and his host and one plug-ugly ( the other was off getting more bourbon and sherry ) stood now in a softly glowing dining room overlooking a formal brick-and-greenery rear garden . On the antique refectory table dominating the room stood two model houses next to a roll of blueprints . The tiniest model , barely six inches tall and built solid of balsa wood with windows and other details painted on , was placed on an aerial photograph to the same scale , apparently illustrating the block in which the finished house would stand . The larger , like a child 's dollhouse , was over two feet tall , with what looked like real glass in its windows and even some furniture in the rooms within . Both models were of a large , nearly square house with a high front stoop , four stories tall , with a big square many-paned skylight in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then at the small , then at the photograph of the street . " This is in New York ? " " Just a few blocks from here . " " Huh , " said Dortmunder , thinking of his own apartment . " You see the skylight , " suggested the elegant man . " Yeah . " " It can be opened in good weather . There 's an atrium on the second level . You know what an atrium is ? " " No . " " It 's a kind of garden , within the house . Here , let me show you . " The larger model was built in pieces , which could be disassembled . The roof came off first , showing bedrooms and baths all around a big square opening coinciding with the skylight . The top floor came off , was set aside and showed a third floor given over to a master bedroom suite and a bookcase-lined den , around the continuing square atrium hole . The details impressed even Dortmunder . " This thing must have cost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant man smiled . " Not quite , " he said , lifting off the third floor . And here was the bottom of the atrium-fancy word for air shaft , Dortmunder decided-a formal garden like the one outside these real-life dining-room windows , with a fountain and stone paths . The living and dining rooms in the model were open to the atrium . " Moira 's copy , " the elegant man said , pointing at the garden , " is just about there . " " Tricky , " Dortmunder commented . " There are twelve steps down from the atrium level to the sidewalk in front . The rear garden is sunk deeper , below ground level . " " Very tricky . " " Ah , our drinks , " the elegant man said , taking his , " and not a moment too soon . " He sipped elegantly and said , " Mr. Dortmunder , the workman is worthy of his hire . I shall now outline to you our plans and our reasoning . I ask you to give us your careful attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to suggest whatever improvements come to your professional mind . In return , I will pay you-in cash , of course-one thousand dollars . " " And drive me uptown , " Dortmunder said . " I 'm really late for my appointment . " " Agreed . " " OK , then , " Dortmunder said , and looked around for a place to sit down . " Oh , come along , " said the elegant man . " We might as well be comfortable . " Tall , narrow windows in the living room overlooked a tree-lined expensive block . Long sofas in ecru crushed velvet faced each other on the Persian carpet , amid glass-topped tables , modern lamps and antique bric-a-brac . In a Millet over the mantel , a French farmer of the last century endlessly pushed his barrowload of hay through a narrow barn door . The elegant man might have lost his atriummed town house to the scheming Moira , but he was still doing OK . No welfare housing necessary . With a fresh drink to hand , Dortmunder sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , " the elegant man said , as Dortmunder wondered who this " we " was he kept talking about ; surely not the plug-uglies , giants with the brains of two-by-fours , sitting around now on chair arms like a rock star 's body-guards . " Our first plan , perhaps still feasible , involves that skylight and a helicopter . I have access to a heli- " " Loud , " Dortmunder said . The elegant man paused , as though surprised , then smiled . " That 's right , " he said . Dortmunder gave him a flat look . " Was that a test ? You wan na see if I 'll just say , ' Yeah , yeah , that 's fine , give me my grand and take me uptown , ' is that it ? " " To some extent , " agreed the elegant man placidly . " Of course , apart from the noise-a dead giveaway to the entire neighborhood , naturally , the house would swarm with police before we 'd so much as attached the grapple-still , apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive solution . At night , from above- " " Illegal , " interrupted Dortmunder . " Eh ? " " You ca n't fly a helicopter over Manhattan after dark . There 's a law . Never break a law you do n't intend to break : people get grabbed for a traffic violation , and what they 're really doing is robbing a bank . That kind of thing . It happens all the time . " " I see . " The elegant man looked thoughtful . Smoothing back his silver locks , he said , " Every trade is more complicated than it appears , is n't it ? " " Yeah , " said Dortmunder . " What 's plan number two ? " " Ah , yes . " The elegant man regained his pleased look . " This involves the front door . " " How many people in this house ? " " None . " Then the elegant man made a dismissing finger wave , saying , " The staff , of course . But they 're all downstairs . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " " If you say so . Where 's this Moira ? " " She should be in England , mired on the M four , " the elegant man said , looking extremely irritated , " but the delay I 'd arranged for her to undergo did n't quite take place . As a result , she is probably at this very moment boarding her flight to New York . She 'll be here sometime early tomorrow morning . " Shrugging away his annoyance , he said , " Nevertheless , we still have all of tonight . Plan number two , as I started to say , has us forcing entry through the front door . Three strong men " - with a graceful hand gesture to include both himself and the silent plug-uglies- " with some difficulty , can jog the statue onto a low wheeled dolly . Out front , we shall have a truck equipped with a winch , whose long cable will reach as far as the atrium . The winch can pull the statue on the dolly through the house and down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of the truck . " " That sounds OK , " said Dortmunder . " What 's the problem ? " " The guard , " the elegant man explained , " outside the embassy next door . " " Oh , " said Dortmunder . " And if you get rid of the guard .... " " We create an international incident . A side effect even more severe than the breaking of helicopter-at-night laws . " Dortmunder shook his head . " Tell me about plan number three . " " We effect entry through the rear , from the house on the next block . We set various incendiary devices and we burn the place down . " Dortmunder frowned . " Metal does n't burn , " he objected . " A flaw we 'd noticed ourselves , " the elegant man admitted . Dortmunder drank bourbon and gave his host a look of disgust . " You do n't have any plan at all , " he said . " We have no good plans , " the elegant man said . " Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand dollars ? " Dortmunder sipped bourbon and looked patiently at the elegant man . Who smiled , a bit sadly . " I see what you mean , " he said . " Say two thousand . " " Say ten thousand , " Dortmunder suggested . " I could n't possibly say ten thousand . I might find it possible to say twenty-five hundred . " It took three minutes and many little delicate silences before Dortmunder and the elegant man reached the $5000 honorarium both had settled on in advance . Continues ...
