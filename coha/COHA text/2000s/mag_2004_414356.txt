You must work quickly to draw Jupiter , but not as quickly as you may think . // ANYONE CAN DRAW JUPITER . With just a little preparation ( and a steady atmosphere ) , even " artistically challenged " observers can sketch amazing amounts of detail visible on the king of planets . Here 's how I 've learned to draw Jovian features that I see in the eyepiece . The Blueprint Jupiter rotates very rapidly , making one complete revolution on its axis in less than 10 hours . This means that features sweep across Jupiter 's central meridian ( an imaginary line connecting the planet 's north and south poles ) at a rate of nearly 1o ' every 15 minutes . So the face of the planet appears to change very quickly . To make an accurate drawing , you 'll need to record the planet 's finest details in 10 minutes or less . But do n't worry . With proper planning you can stretch that 10 minutes into an hour . The first step in drawing Jupiter is to make a blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Jupiter diagram at the bottom of this page shows the relative positions of the planet 's major belts and zones . Photocopy it onto sheets of drawing paper ( I use Strathmore acid-free , 50-pound sketch paper , 300 series ) , and draw a blank disk the same size beside the diagram . Working with gentle strokes I use a #4B Pentalic woodless pencil ) , shade the blank disk . Do not press down hard with the pencil , since you want to produce a medium gray tone . Use your index finger to create a uniform tone and use a tortillon ( a paper  --  fiber blending stump ) to add the effect of limb darkening . Now , with the diagram as your guide , use a straightedge to place tick marks at the outer edge of the shaded disk showing the positions of the two polar regions and the planet 's four major belts : the South Equatorial Belt ( SEB ) , North Equatorial Belt ( NEB ) , South Temperate Belt ( STeB ) , and North Temperate Belt ( NTeB ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts have varied in width and intensity through the years , their latitudes have remained fairly constant . Note , however , that some of them might not be visible , especially in small telescopes , so the tick marks are merely reference points . Here 's what your completed blueprint should look like : // Laying the Foundation The art of drawing starts with seeing . The first thing you should do at the telescope is spend 10 minutes critically examining the main Jovian features . At this point you 're not looking for fine details , but rather the extent of the polar regions and the four primary belts . With a large telescope you probably can not help but see lots of distracting details . In such cases I defocus the image ever so slightly to subdue the fine structure . Once you are confident in what you see , spend the next 10 minutes sketching the true extent and position of these features . Use the tortillon to smooth them out . Take as much time as you need ; this is , after all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will probably look something like this : // Spend the next to minutes adding any additional belts such as the South South Temperate Belt ( SSTeB ) or North North Temperate Belt ( NNTeB ) . Finally , using an eraser , create the light zones between the belts ( I use a malleable gum eraser , which I can pinch into a point or flatten until it has an edge ) . If some zones are darker than others , use your pencil to fill in the proper shade . Again , take your time to get the shades and contrasts right . You can also add some textures to the major belts and zones . Dappling with an eraser , for instance , will create a mottled texture . At this point your drawing will probably look like this : // The Race Begins By now you 'll have been at the eyepiece for at least a half hour , and you 'll have before you a foundation that represents the full face of Jupiter with all its belts and zones laid out accurately in latitude . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus and seek out the finer details . Once again I recommend spending at least 10 minutes doing nothing but looking . After that , record the time ( and date ) and start your final drawing . Now you are racing the clock . As quickly as possible , record with your pencil and eraser the most obvious fine details you can see in 10 minutes . Despite the time pressure , pay close attention to each feature 's position relative to the planet 's limb and central meridian . When 10 minutes are up , record the ending time . But you 're not finished . Use the final io minutes of the hour to fill in any extremely fine details that might be lurking between the features you 've just drawn . Also be sure to mark the preceding ( west ) and following ( east ) sides of the planet and note whether south is up or down . // The Reward If you practice drawing Jupiter on many nights , you 'll soon become adept at seeing and recording finer and finer details . Each night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more precious than any electronic image . You will have in your possession a one-of-a-kind image - something that no one else could have created or reproduced in exactly the same way It 's a personal representation of a world 400 million miles distant seen through the eyes of someone who loves the sky . If you are a budding artist just beginning to draw Jupiter , be sure to save your sketches in a notebook for future reference . * Author Affiliation When it comes to keeping tabs on planetary happenings , contributing editor STEPHEN JAMES O'MEARA prefers the eye and sketchpad to cameras and computers . // <p>
