The U.S. is declaring war on money laundering by terrorists , drug dealers and crooked politicians . Private banking might be the first casualty . <p> " It 's time to get tough , " Senator John Kerry ( D-Mass. ) recently told the Senate Banking , Housing &; Urban Affairs Committee . While the bombs fall on Kabul , Kerry is pushing one of several bills zipping through Congress to crack down on 25 " uncooperative " and " renegade " offshore-bank secrecy havens , from Nauru , a tiny Pacific island , to Israel . <p> " The banking community has certain sensitivities , " explained Senator Charles Grassley ( R-Iowa ) . " Respect for each other 's relationships with clients ; a kind of lack of transparency ; maintaining privacy ; respect for secrecy . Well , in normal times I think we would respect that . But these are not normal times . It 's time we put these sensitivities we have respected within the banking community aside . " <p> Congress ' war on dirty money , in short , is aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One private banker we spoke to called some of Congress ' preliminary findings " hysterical . " Michel D(c)robert , director general of the Swiss Private Bankers Association , warns " the risks of throwing the baby out with the bath are pretty high at the moment . " <p> This is a big baby . Private banks worldwide manage an estimated $16 trillion in assets , according to the Senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations . Private banks , stand-alone or operational units within a larger bank , are defined as specialized banks providing financial services to high-net-worth individuals . Some of those wealthy clients want personal investment advice , some want a shelter from politically unstable home countries , says Clive Bannister , director of HSBC 's private banking unit , with $170 billion under management . But these are n't the only reasons . Another : hiding money from ex-spouses , tax collectors and creditors . The problem , notes Senator Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) , sponsor of the money laundering bill that cleared the Senate on Oct. 4 : " Servicing a client almos t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money laundering  --  secret trusts , offshore accounts , secret-name accounts and shell companies . " <p> The International Monetary Fund estimates that 2% to 5% of global GDP , or $600 billion to $1.5 trillion , is laundered on its way through the economy , with anywhere from a third to half that amount entering the U.S. financial system . While the Bin Laden money trail currently points to correspondent banking abuses and to hawala ( an ancient Islamic system of transferring cash ) , a string of 1990s scandals revealed that a lot of dirty money has historically been laundered by private banking . <p> Almost two dozen private banks around the globe  --  from venerable Credit Suisse to M.M. Warburg Bank  --  unwittingly helped whitewash the five-year kleptocracy of Nigeria 's General Sani Abacha . The September 1999 Congressional Research Service Issue Brief to lawmakers states that General Abacha and his family may have stolen " over $3.5 billion , " almost bankrupting Nigeria 's treasury in the process . In 1998 , weeks after General Abacha died of a heart attack , his wife was stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foreign currency . <p> El Hadj Omar Bongo , the president of oil-rich Gabon exposed in 1997 during France 's notorious Elf Aquitaine bribery scandal , was a private banking client dating back to 1970 . Asif Ali Zardari and his wife , former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto , were found guilty of bribery by the Lahore High Court in 1999 . The Pakistani government claimed they stole $1 billion from state coffers , using a Swiss attorney to run their tainted fortune through scores of elite private banks in Dubai , Switzerland and the U.K. Zardari was caught and jailed ; Bhutto went into exile . <p> Raul Salinas , brother of Mexico 's former president Carlos Salinas , was a civil servant officially earning $190,000 a year while he ran hundreds of millions of dollars in narcotics payoffs through U.S. , U.K. and Swiss private bank accounts , according to the Senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations . Salinas ' wife was arrested in 1995 at the exclusive Banque Pictet in Switzerland , where she and her husband held approximately $84 million under a false name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder conviction . ) <p> In this scandal Citigroup 's private bank took a big hit to its reputation . Investigators declared that the bank had gone to such extreme lengths to hide Salinas ' identity  --  and was so lax in its internal controls  --  that it had unwittingly become a participant in his money laundering scheme . The day after Salinas was arrested , Citi 's private bankers in New York , London and Zurich got on the phone with each other and , Senate investigators claim , " the tape transcripts indicate that the private bank 's initial reaction to the arrest was not to assist law enforcement but to determine whether the Salinas account should be moved to Switzerland to make the discovery of assets more difficult . " <p> " The culture of private banking has to change , " says Elise Bean , deputy legal counsel to Congress ' permanent subcommittee on investigations . " The kind of secrecy that some people want is way beyond what is legitimate and way beyond what any private bank should be providing . " <p> In the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private bankers and their professional instinct to shield clients from investigations . The Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) , a global body set up by the first President Bush , refined its 40 recommendations on how to combat money laundering , which in turn triggered the rewriting of bank laws across the globe . The underlying message : Private banks should be managing assets , not laundering them . <p> The FATF 's philosophy for bankers : Know your customer . HSBC private bankers , for example , can now open a new account only after a supervisor and a compliance officer have independently verified that the bank knows the end beneficiary of the accounts and can identify the source of the wealth . Ian Woodhouse , director of European private bank consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers , notes that private banks are investing heavily in software systems that track beneficial ownerships of accounts and flag unusual payments . <p> Congress wants to empower the Treasury Department to prevent any country , government or financial institution that harbors crooks or does " not adhere to the higher standards of banking behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The U.S. will freeze assets and bar the offender from doing business in the U.S. <p> Okay , but what if one of these questionable institutions did business with a mainstream European bank which , in turn , did business with the U.S. ? " If a large country with a sophisticated banking system continues to deal with banks in one of these small countries that we know are designed to hide money , " declares Senator Charles Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) in the Sept. 26 Congressional Record , " they will face penalties in dealing with our banking system . Even the French or German or British or Japanese , which have huge banking systems , have to be part of our system . " <p> There is a limit , of course , to how far the U.S. can reach in imposing its notions of clean banking on the rest of the world . The scary thing for foreign bankers , though , is that their home-country governments are often quite sympathetic to those notions . European bureaucrats like tax cheats as little as U.S. congressmen like terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that Congress will run riot over client confidentiality , but Congress has had enough of some of their clients . Asif Ali Zardari <p> The husband of Pakistan 's former prime minister was called " Mr. 10% " until he was finally convicted of bribery . Alleged theft : $1 billion . <p> Sani Abacha <p> Nigeria 's murderous strongman and his family are alleged to have stolen $3.5 billion betwen 1993 and 1998 . Died of natural causes . <p> Raul Salinas <p> The brother of Mexico 's former president was convicted of murder after being accused of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Asif Ali Zardari <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sani Abacha <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Raul Salinas <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Richard C.
