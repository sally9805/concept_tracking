<p> PRIVATE equity firms seem to be snapping up everything in sight  --  but they 're also selling stakes in many of the companies they have acquired . <p> Last year , almost half of the more than 150 initial public offerings in the United States involved such sales by buyout firms , a higher share than ever before , according to Jay Ritter , a finance professor at the University of Florida who specializes in I.P.O. research . <p> Generally , however , the returns were nothing to brag about . On average , shares in such sales , known as buyout I.P.O. 's , performed far worse last year than both the overall market and other companies that made their public debuts , according to figures from Thomson Financial . <p> Indeed , four of the biggest , mostly closely followed sales  --  involving shares of Sealy ( backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts ) , Warner Chilcott ( Bain Capital ) , Magellan Midstream Holdings ( the Carlyle Group ) and Goodman Global ( Apollo Management )  --  dropped sharply after they went public and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels . <p> Hertz Global Holdings , which has gained substantially since its public offering in November , may be more the exception than the rule . The company  --  owned by a consortium including the Carlyle Group , Clayton , Dubilier &; Rice and an investment arm of Merrill Lynch  --  has a strong equipment leasing business in addition to brand leadership in car rentals . The public sale represented 28 percent of the shares . <p> Still , automatically ruling out any investment in buyout I.P.O. 's may prove short-sighted . Two academic studies last year showed that such I.P.O. 's have given investors a good shot at beating the market over the long run . In one study , Jerry Cao , a doctoral candidate at Boston College , and Josh Lerner , a Harvard Business School professor , found that buyout offerings from 1980 to 2002 returned 43 percent , on average , over the subsequent three years , versus just 26 percent for the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index over the same span  --  a difference of 17 percentage points . Similarly , Professor Ritter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market from 1980 to 2003 outperformed the S. &; P. by 18 points in their next three years . <p> Professor Lerner quickly acknowledges that it would be highly impractical for most investors to try to duplicate these results on their own . They could n't pick stocks randomly or even every one in a single year and expect a sure gain , as amply illustrated by the results of 2006 . Investors would have to buy them all  --  more than 400 in his and Professor Ritter 's studies . <p> Nevertheless , there are solid reasons that reverse leveraged buyouts have tended to do better than the overall market , he said . Among the most important factors , he said , is " how much engagement the private equity firm has with a company . " <p> The more involved the firm has been , the more likely that the I.P.O. 's returns will beat the market , he said . With that in mind , investors should consider how long a private equity firm owned a company before taking it public . Many private equity firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using mainly borrowed money , then doing little more than bringing the company to market as quickly as possible . This can result in fat profits for the private equity firm , with the newly marketed company struggling under a mountain of debt . <p> The study by Professor Lerner and Mr. Cao showed that companies bought by private equity firms and then sold to the public in a year or less underperformed the market by 5 percent over three years . Sealy , Warner Chilcott , Magellan Midstream Holdings and Goodman were all relatively short-term holdings before the private equity firms brought them to market  --  roughly two years , compared with an average of seven for all the companies in the study . <p> The study also found an apparent link between the size of the stake sold by buyout firms and the shares ' subsequent performance . When the firms unloaded a smaller part of their stakes  --  an average of 9 percent  --  in taking private companies public , the shares performed 30 percent better , on average , than the S. &; P. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an average of 23 percent of their stakes  --  the shares ' return was generally no better than the index 's , the study found . <p> Also important was what the private equity firms did with the money raised in the I.P.O. 's . If they used the cash to pay off debt , Mr. Cao and Professor Lerner found , the stocks would gain 13 percentage points more , on average , than if they used the funds to pay the owners large dividends and advisory fees for their stewardship . <p> In addition to these factors , strong management and good cash flow to support debt payments and operations are beneficial for I.P.O. 's of all sorts . <p> Koppers is a classic example of an old-line industrial company given a second chance in the market , said Lawrence Alexander , an analyst at Jeffries &; Company . Koppers was a fading 80-year-old coal-products giant when it was taken private 18 years ago , but its stock rose sharply after Saratoga Partners , its principal owners for the last decade , took it public last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public when Koppers made its debut ; it sold comparable stakes a week later and in November for substantial profits . <p> " It 's a different business now , " Mr. Alexander said . " They 've got a better mix and they used some of their I.P.O. funds to make an excellent acquisition . " <p> A COMPUTER components maker , Smart Modular Technologies , has also done well its second time around as a public company . Linda Killian , who manages the IPO Plus Aftermarket fund , owns shares in the company and said she has a lot of confidence in one of its principal shareholders , the Texas Pacific Group , which used some of the I.P.O. funds to pay down debt . " They 're good investors with a well-deserved reputation for turnarounds , " she said . <p> Robert Napoli , an analyst at Piper Jaffray , said he likes the prospects of another company , Clayton Holdings , a mortgage services business with a blue-chip Wall Street clientele . Clayton 's revenue and market share rose after its I.P.O. last March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both earnings and the share price have since recovered . <p> Mr. Napoli expects the shares to rise to $21 this year from their current trading level of $18.61 . Mr. Napoli said the firm 's backers , TA Associates , still have " substantial ownership in the company and they 've got a good track record . " <p> Yet , with the I.P.O. supply channel building up , the market may remain soft and the performance of many newly reborn companies may be disappointing again this year . If so , investors hoping for above-average gains will have to do more than kick the tires of whatever the buyout firms roll out the door. ##
