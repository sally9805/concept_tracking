First came the warmth . Three weeks after New Year 's and the thermometer did what it never does in January in Algonquin Bay : it rose above the freezing mark . Within a matter of hours the streets were shiny and black with melted snow . There was n't a trace of sun . A ceiling of cloud installed itself above the cathedral spire and gave every appearance of permanence . The warm days that followed passed in an oppressive twilight that lasted from breakfast to late afternoon . Everywhere there were dark mutterings about global warming . Then came the fog . At first it moved in fine tendrils among the trees and forests that surround Algonquin Bay . By Saturday afternoon it was rolling in thick clouds along the highways . The wide expanse of Lake Nipissing dwindled to a faint outline , then vanished utterly . Slowly the fog squeezed its way into town and pressed itself up against the stores and the churches . One by one the red brick houses retired behind the grubby grey curtain . By Monday morning Ivan Bergeron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept late , having drunk an unwise amount of beer while watching the hockey game the night before . Now he was making his way from the house to his garage , which was less than twenty yards away but totally obscured by fog . The stuff clung in webs to Bergeron 's face and hands ; he could feel it trailing through his fingers . And it played tricks with sound . The yellow bloom of headlights glided by , dead slow , followed  --  after an otherworldly delay  --  by the sound of tires on wet road . Somewhere his dog was barking . Normally , Shep was a quiet , self-sufficient kind of mutt . But for some reason  --  maybethe fog  --  he was out in the woods and barking maniacally . The sound pierced Bergeron 's hungover skull like needles . " Shep ! Come here , Shep ! " He waited for a few moments in the murk , but the dog did n't come . Bergeron opened up the garage and went to work on the battered Ski-Doo he had promised to fix by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon , and the thing was still in bits and pieces around the shop . He switched on the radio , and the voices of the CBC filled the garage . Usually , when it was warm enough , he worked with the garage door open , but the fog lay in the driveway like some creature out of a nightmare and he found it depressing . He was just about to pull the door down when the dog 's barking got louder , sounding like it was coming from the backyard now . " Shep ! " Bergeron waded through the fog , one hand out before him like a blind man . " Shep ! For God 's sake , can it , willya ? " The barking changed to growling , interrupted by peculiar canine whines . A tremor of unease passed through Bergeron 's outsize frame . Last time this had happened , the dog had been playing with a snake . " Shep . Take it easy , boy . I 'm coming . " Bergeron moved with small steps now , edging his way forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog . " Shep ? " He could just make the dog out , six feet away , down on his forepaws , clawing at something on the ground . Bergeron edged closer and took hold of the dog 's collar . " Easy , boy . " The dog whined a little and licked his hand . Bergeron bent lower to see what was on the ground . " Oh my God . " It lay there , fishbelly white , hair curling along one side . Toward the wrist end , the flesh still bore the zigzag impression of a watch with an expandable bracelet . Even though there was no hand attached , there was no doubt that the thing lying in Ivan Bergeron 's backyard was a human arm . * * * * * If it had n't been for Ray Choquette 's decision to retire , John Cardinal would not have been sitting in the waiting room with his father when he could have been down at headquarters catching up on phone calls , or  --  better yet  --  out on the street making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys . But no . Here he was , stuck with his father , waiting to see a doctor neither of them had ever met . A female doctor at that  --  as if Stan Cardinal was going to take advice from a woman . Ray Choquette , Cardinal thought , I could wring your lazy , inconsiderate neck . The senior Cardinal was eighty-three  --  physically . The hair on his forearms was white now , and he had the watery eyes of a very old man . In other ways , his son was thinking , the guy never got past the age of four . " How much longer is she gon na make us wait ? " Stan asked for the third time . " Forty-five minutes we 've been sitting here . What kind of respect does that show for other people 's time ? How can she possibly be a good doctor ? " " It 's like anything else , Dad . A good doctor 's a busy doctor . " " Nonsense . It 's greed . A hundred percent pure capitalist greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a year on the railroad . We had to fight like hell to get that kind of money , and by God we fought for it . But nobody goes to medical school because they want to make thirty-five thousand dollars . " Here we go , Cardinal thought . Rant number 27D . It was like his father 's brain consisted of a collection of cassettes . " And then you 've got the government playing Scrooge with these guys , " Stan went on . " So they become stockbrokers or lawyers , where they can make the kind of money they want . And then we end up with no damn doctors . " " Talk to Geoff Mantis . He 's the one who took the chainsaw to medicare . " " They 'd make you wait , anyways , no matter how many of them there were , " Stan said . " It 's a class thing . Class not only must exist , it must be seen to exist . Making you wait is their way of saying , I 'm important and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a shortage of doctors . That 's why we have to wait . " " What I want to know is , what kind of young woman spends her day looking down people 's throats and up their anuses ? I 'd never do it . " " Mr. Cardinal ? " Stan got to his feet with difficulty . The young receptionist came round from behind her desk , clutching a file folder . " Do you need some help ? " " I 'm fine , I 'm fine . " Stan turned to his son . " You coming , or what ? " " I do n't need to go in with you , " Cardinal said . " No , you come too . I want you to hear this . You think I 'm not fit to drive , I want you to hear the truth . "
