A marked contrast divides the South Korean capital city of Seoul . The U.S. Embassy near Kwanghwamun on Sejong-no reminds people of a war zone : hundreds of heavily armed riot police guard the embassy building and every nearby alley. ( n1 ) However , the Russian Embassy at the old Paejae School and the Chinese Embassy at Myongdong are so peaceful and quiet the guards at the entrance doze . The United States helped fight the 1950-53 Korean War and assumed the responsibility for South Korea 's survival through generous economic and military assistance programs after the war . During the war , the Chinese and Russians backed the North to fight the South and the United States . However , viewing these embassy buildings may lead people to believe that South Korea 's enemy is the United States . Also , a minor traffic accident or bickering becomes a big social issue when it is committed by U.S. soldiers . Although Korean victims of American crimes receive wide media attention , almost no coverage is given to unprovoked attacks against American service personnel by Koreans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Forces Korea ( USFK ) , which are seen as either helpful or harmful to South Korea . Even if the approximately 36,000 U.S. troops are stationed to help maintain South Korean security , some people , particularly younger Koreans , see the troops not as protectors but as occupiers . The younger generation also believes the USFK is a barrier to the reunification of the Korean peninsula , their most ardent wish . In short , they regard the U.S. military presence as being against the interests of the Korean people . <p> On the other hand , other South Koreans believe the country 's national interests take precedence over the Korean people 's minjokjuui ( nationalism ) . They see protection of their economic prosperity , democracy , and human rights as national interests and believe the USFK has served South Korea 's vital interests well . They attach more importance to the South Korea-U.S. military alliance rather than to the reunification of both Koreas , for reunification implies the rejection of the United States . In sum , what determines South Korean views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : alliance or nationalism . <p> The South Korean perception of American forces is an important issue for Korea-U.S. relations . An opinion survey of seventy-two Korea experts in America , conducted by Tonga Ilbo ( East Asia Daily ) , reported that 68.0 percent of respondents were concerned about the rise of anti-American sentiment in South Korea . As for the causes of the phenomenon , 20.4 percent pointed out several problems incurred by U.S. military bases in densely populated areas , and 8.2 percent indicated a series of incidents involving U.S. soldiers ? ( n2 ) This paper analyzes South Korean views of American forces in recent years . It also examines important factors that influence Korean perceptions of the USFK . General Survey of Korean Views of the USFK <p> According to the U.S.-Soviet agreement to divide the Korean peninsula at the 38th parallel immediately before the end of World War II , on 7 September 1945 General Douglas MacArthur , commander of the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers , formally established American control in Korea south of the parallel . The next day , Lieutenant General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea . American forces established the United States Army Military Government in Korea ( USAMGIK ) . The USAMGIK was the only government in the southern zone of the Korean peninsula . <p> South Korea became a sovereign state ( Republic of Korea ; ROK ) in August 1948 under the auspices of the United States . On 29 June 1949 , the United States withdrew the last of its combat forces from South Korea . But American forces returned to South Korea in early July 1950 to fight the Korean War . Since then , the U.S. military presence in Korea has continued . <p> Today , American soldiers are more visible in downtown Seoul than in any other Asian capital . U.S. forces live in relative isolation from their Korean hosts . The United States concentrates many of its troops in spartan quarters near the demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) , but other personnel fill an enormous and comfortable rear guard camp in Seoul . The Yongsan military installations , once the home of the Japanese Imperial Army , now occupy about as much space as Seoul 's entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as scarce and expensive as it is in Tokyo , the grandeur of the Yongsan military base includes swimming pools , commissaries , schools , and 1950s-style suburban houses . American troops legally are protected by a Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) that usually allows those associated with the American military to live beyond the reach of Korean civil law . In general , South Korea has been one of the few nations in which the United States could do as it pleased despite local opposition . <p> The U.S. military presence had been a taboo subject for Koreans . As late as the 1970s , anyone who suggested withdrawal of U.S. forces might have faced instant arrest and been charged with supporting North Korea in violation of the strict National Security Law . During this time , debates in America concerning the withdrawal of troops disappointed many South Koreans and made them feel uneasy about their nation 's security . The American decision to withdraw the Seventh U.S. Army Division in 1970 , which decreased the number of the USFK from approximately 60,000 to 40,000 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Carter administration announced its plan to withdraw the Second U.S. Army Division from South Korea in 1977 , most Koreans expressed fears that this action would prompt North Korea to invade and asked Americans not to support the withdrawal . Carter 's withdrawal plan caused a major political crisis , even public panic , in South Korea . The United States was forced to drop the idea . <p> Recently , however , the U.S. military profile has been debated and even has been criticized by some South Koreans because of their growing confidence in their country . Such criticism has developed into friction between the two allies . Because a powerful hostile force lies just to the north of the DMZ and no peace agreement or nonaggression pact with North Korea has been reached , a majority of the South Koreans desire the continued presence of U.S. forces . In short , the high-profile U.S. military presence has served Korean needs for the past many years , but lowering that profile has become an essential issue for Seoul and Washington . <p> Today , the nongovernmental organization ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , want a total U.S. military withdrawal from South Korea and an end to the ROK-U.S. alliance . Instead of pushing the cause of withdrawal , however , they focus on issues that reduce the political credibility of the alliance . By doing this , the activists market themselves as advocates of Korean national pride within the framework of the alliance but seek to undermine and ultimately destroy the alliance . The political establishment , meanwhile , remains committed to the security alliance and emphasizes its importance . In early September 2002 , then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung told a group of foreign journalists that " some people are emotional in criticizing the United States , but America is an ally that is necessary and important for our national interests . U.S. troops are here for peace on the Korean peninsula . " ( n3 ) In late January 2002 , Yi Hoe-ch'ang , then president of the main opposition Grand National Party , said at the Asia Society in New York that " the USFK should remain in South Korea for stability and balance of power in Northeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that South Korea 's prosperity had been built on its military alliance with the United States and the American military presence , which had played an essential role in deterring another war on the Korean peninsula , and that " most Korean people are well aware of the USFK 's role . " ( n4 ) <p> The South Korean stance on the U.S. military presence is complex ; it is a mixture of national pride and realism . Many South Koreans resent the " unnatural " effects of the American military presence and are ashamed to rely on foreign troops for their national security when their rival North Korea does not . For a people with a history of being an independent nation , visible reminders of dependence upon the United States ( e.g. , the presence of the Yongsan garrison in downtown Seoul ) are irritating . In the early 1990s , an opposition lawmaker stressed that " it is true that America 's military presence has sometimes hurt our standing in the international community and hurt the pride of the people of South Korea . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so accustomed to American protection that they tend to regard any changes as a dangerous betrayal of the ties between the two nations . Because of the North Korean military threat , many South Koreans do not want a rapid change in security ties between their country and the United States . In his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 12 May 1989 , U.S. ambassador-designate Donald P. Gregg testified that " most Koreans , while critical of some aspects of our military presence , recognize the need for a continued U.S. security commitment including the presence of U.S. troops . " ( n6 ) An American analyst expressed the same opinion , saying in June 1987 that " not many Koreans seem to endorse ' Yankee go home ' in a literal sense-removing the American soldiers who beef up Korea 's defense . ' We still think we need the troops for our protection , ' one student told me , between their choruses of ' Yankee go home . " ' ( n7 ) <p> An early 1997 poll of fourteen hundred Yonsei University students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are anti-American , " whereas 21.2 percent indicated they are " pro-American . " However , the phobia against the United States did not lead to a prevailing demand for the withdrawal of American forces from South Korea . Surprisingly , 50.2 percent of the students polled admitted that the U.S. military presence " is needed , " whereas 31.8 percent opposed the stationing of the USFK in their nation. ( n8 ) According to an opinion survey of one thousand Koreans conducted by the Han ' gyore Sinmun ( Korean People Newspaper ) from 16 through 17 September 2000 , 70.6 percent of the pollees said " the USFK should continue to stay here to deter a potential North Korean invasion into South Korea " despite considerable progress in inter-Korean relations at the time . On the major role of U.S. troops since 1945 , 76.3 percent of those surveyed agreed that they " have served as a deterrent to war " on the Korean peninsula , although 23.2 percent disagreed with that assessment. ( n9 ) <p> South Koreans ' ambivalent views of the U.S. military presence have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops or for their presence " so far as circumstances permit , " instead of immediate withdrawal or perpetual presence . The surveys in table 1 reveal that many South Koreans are skeptical of the American military presence in their country but still feel a need for it . <p> A wide generation gap is found between the conservative , older generation ( fifties and older ) and the progressive , younger generation ( twenties and thirties ) concerning the American military presence . The older generation survived the Korean War and humiliating poverty after the war and remembers the American help and sacrifice . The younger generation are accustomed to an affluent and democratic society and find it difficult to tolerate heavy-handed Americans and misbehaving GIs ; they want an ally that respects their national pride and dignity . Many South Koreans , especially from the younger generation that did not experience the bitter Korean War years , take for granted a fifty-plus-year peace and seem confident that no hostility will occur from their " fellow " North Koreans. ( n10 ) According to a Chungang Ilbo ( Central Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 January 2003 , 13.8 percent of those questioned demanded a complete pullout or substantial reduction of American troops and 42.8 percent favored a small-scale reduction of the forces . On the other hand , 41.5 percent maintained the USFK should remain at the present level and 2.0 percent asserted that it should be expanded . But opinions ranged widely according to the age groups . Although 51.5 percent of those age fifty and older emphasized the USFK should retain the current level , only 29.5 percent of people in their twenties agreed . Whereas 8.0 percent of those age fifty and older supported a full withdrawal or large-scale reduction , 15.4 percent of people in their twenties favored it. ( n11 ) Yongsan and SOFA <p> Today , many South Koreans resent the " unnatural effects " of the U.S. military presence . For example , Koreans are reminded of the advantages and isolation of American life in South Korea every time they see American goods from U.S. commissaries on the black market . Moreover , the isolation of many American soldiers leads Koreans to be suspicious of what lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the center of foreign power in Korea . During the Japanese colonial period ( 1910-45 ) , the area became the headquarters of the Japanese Imperial Army . After 1945 , the U.S. Army set up headquarters in the vacated Japanese military headquarters and has stayed ever since . No other nation on earth has a foreign military facility in the center of its capital city . That South Koreans continue to tolerate the existence of foreign troops in the heart of their capital city is , by any standard , an anomaly . The Yongsan base often has been called " the number one U.S. colony , " " the United States of America in South Korea , " and " the fifty-first American State " by cynical Koreans . <p> During the years of authoritarian rule , media censorship muzzled Korean dissatisfaction with the U.S. military presence . This began to change in the early 1980s , when opponents of the Chun Doo-hwan regime began to view the United States as an accomplice in the authoritarian rule and as a barrier to reunification . The success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising national pride and confidence . After years of military-oriented authoritarian rule and relative poverty , South Korea moved toward becoming a prosperous democratic nation , an " advanced nation " as the lingo of the times described it . By the end of 1987 , South Korea had taken a new road to democracy . Thus , Koreans could express their views freely on such heated issues as U.S. forces , a subject that had long been taboo . <p> South Koreans called to move USFK headquarters from the 699 acres of Yongsan to a rural area . In 1991 , Seoul and Washington agreed to do so by 1997 , with South Korea bearing the full cost of the move . But this effort fizzled because of high costs and the crisis over the North Korean nuclear weapons project in 1994 . In 1991 , the USFK returned the South Post golf course to South Korea , which is now the Yongsan Family Park . <p> The economic crisis of 1997 caused a temporary collapse in national confidence among South Koreans , pushing discussion of the ROK-U.S. alliance off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the recovery came quickly and powerfully . The speed of recovery and the successful World Cup in the summer of 2002 restored national confidence , particularly among younger generations who came of age during democratization in the 1980s . <p> The issue of moving the U.S. military base out of Seoul came to the fore again in December 2001 , when the USFK revealed plans for a large new apartment complex in the Yongsan compound . The project evoked resentment among many Koreans , who suspected that Washington was planning to keep the Yongsan base permanently . To avoid public anger over the apartment project , the ROK government and the USFK dusted off the relocation plan , titled the " Yongsan Plan . " At that time , the two sides postponed a final decision on a new military base . However , in early 2003 , Washington decided to move the military base because of intense anti-Americanism among Koreans and the increasingly strained alliance between South Korea and the United States . On 18 March 2003 , a high-ranking official at the Defense Department stated the U.S. government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early as possible . The new site would be 817 acres of land near the Seventh U.S. Air Force base in Osan . The cost for relocation was estimated between $2 billion and $3 billion , far less than the original relocation cost of $20 billion . On 24 July 2003 , Seoul and Washington agreed to complete the relocation by 2006. ( n12 ) <p> Since the late 1980s , the SOFA has become a time bomb in the ROK-U.S. relationship and a major source of anti-Americanism for many Koreans , who believe it is heavily in favor of Americans . A Chungang Ilbo survey of 1,006 Koreans , conducted from 3 through 6 August 2000 , indicated 75.7 percent of those surveyed state the bilateral pact " is unequal " ; only 18.9 percent regard it as " equal . " ( n13 ) When Koreans speak of wanting more respect from the United States , the nation is referring to the same respect America shows Japan , their former colonial ruler . <p> The SOFA is a pact guaranteeing benefits to U.S. soldiers , within specific legal boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eighty-five countries in Asia , Europe , and the Middle East . Generally , when two countries enter the agreement , it is the country with less power that requests the pact be signed , which provides legal measures to manage and to prevent crimes by foreign soldiers . The SOFA between South Korea and the United States was signed in July 1966 under fierce pressure by Seoul . Before the pact , there had been no way to punish U.S. soldiers who committed such crimes as murder or rape in Korea . Some clauses that had been considered unfavorable to Korean victims were removed in the 1991 and 2000 revisions. ( n14 ) Despite these amendments , South Koreans believe they did not experience fairness under the SOFA ( see table 2 ) . ( n15 ) <p> South Korean government officials and Americans advocated the second revision to the SOFA in 2000 . A Korean Foreign Ministry official asserted , " the SOFA has been an uncomfortable chair to sit on . But we will be able to sit on it for a longer period from now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. ambassador to Korea said in his 7 February 2001 speech in Seoul that the rewritten SOFA " strengthened the foundation for a continued , strong military relationship between us based on the simultaneous respect for Korea 's growing democratic traditions and the maintenance of the rights of our service members . " ( n17 ) However , civic groups and critics denounced the outcome of the talks for failing to meet public expectations , and it was probable that the two sides would engage in serious disputes over the handling of specific crime cases . <p> That probability turned into reality in November 2002 , when the call for another SOFA revision gained momentum following the acquittal of two American soldiers , whose forty-five-ton armored vehicle killed two local Korean teenage girls in June . The track commander and the driver of the vehicle were court-martialed after the USFK denied the South Korean government 's request in August to exert jurisdiction over the two soldiers . Under the present SOFA , the U.S. military has primary jurisdiction over personnel who commit crimes while on duty . Whether an American soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seven-member jury , consisting of all Americans , dismissed the U.S. military prosecution 's charges of negligent homicide against the two GIs . <p> The U.S. court-martial decisions , as had been anticipated , created outrage among Koreans . The protests of civic groups over the court ruling gradually became less about the verdict and more about anti-Americanism . One of the most intense waves of anti-Americanism in recent years swept throughout South Korea . Thousands of NGO members and student activists demonstrated outside the U.S. military camp where the trials took place . Some U.S. facilities in Seoul were attacked with Molotov cocktails , and some entertainment spots banned American soldiers . In downtown Seoul , a Western-style bistro put a sign on its windows stating , " Not welcome the Americans . " Some civic groups protested in front of the White House in Washington . In early December in Seoul , around seventeen thousand citizens paraded with candles in hand , calling for revisions to the SOFA. ( n18 ) On 27 November , President George W. Bush made an apology through Seoul Ambassador Thomas Hubbard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also expressed regret in person at the Thirty-fourth ROK-U.S. security consultative meeting held in early December in Washington. ( n19 ) Candlelight vigils protesting the acquittals of the two soldiers continued into 2003 . <p> The younger generations believe this so-called U.S. military armored vehicle incident severely hurt Koreans ' pride , especially when viewed with a string of incidents involving the USFK , most notably the Nogun-ni civilian massacre that occurred in July 1950 ; a bombing accident in 2000 that involved a U.S. jet fighter at a strafing and firing range at Maehyang-ni , some eighty kilometers south of Seoul ; and illegal dumping of toxic chemicals into the Han River , the main tap water source for the population of Seoul and its neighboring provinces . The younger generation are less prone than their parents to tolerate U.S. arrogance and want the two countries to be equal . North Korean Threat <p> The most important factor to influence South Korean views of the USFK has been the presence of hostile North Korea beyond the DMZ . North Korea constitutes a threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean War and its continued threat to invade the south have justified the U.S. military presence and made the American withdrawal a taboo subject , a policy that existed even before the Korean War . On 13 October 1948 , immediately after the ROK was established , a quarter of the members of the ROK National Assembly introduced a resolution calling on the United States to remove its troops from Korea . But the public mood in South Korea shifted after the outbreak of the Yosu-Sunch ' on Rebellion . On 19 October 1948 , two thousand troops of the Fourteenth Regiment of the South Korean Army , instigated by the Communists , rebelled at the port city of Yosu as they were about to embark for Cheju-do to suppress the uprising on the island . The troops seized control of the city and the nearby rail junction at Sunch'on . The rebellion finally ended on 26 October , but it unsettled the South Korean public , undermined confidence in their security forces , and increased the likelihood of an overt North Korean military assault across the 38th parallel . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same politicians who had sponsored the resolution demanding that American troops leave now clamored for temporary halting of the withdrawal. ( n20 ) <p> The Korean War has long been known as " the war that has never ended . " The armistice of July 1953 was to be the first step along the way to a peace agreement to formally end the struggle . But no such pact has ever been arranged . To this day , the border between South Korea and North Korea remains one of the most heavily militarized in the world , with about 1.2 million North Korean troops on one side and some 700,000 ROK army and 36,000 American troops on the other . <p> The Communist regime of North Korea is still unpredictable . According to a poll of twelve hundred South Koreans compiled by Chungang Ilbo between 31 August and 14 September 2002 , 49.3 percent of those polled believed that the possibility of North Korean provocation of another war " still remains , " whereas only 14.8 percent disagreed with this assessment. ( n21 ) A Tonga Ilbo survey of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50.0 percent believed North Korea " is militarily the most threatening country , " whereas 30.0 percent worried about Japan. ( n22 ) Consequently , since 1953 the United States has maintained a military presence in South Korea , to serve as a reminder that an unprovoked attack on the ROK will be regarded as an attack on an American ally . The majority of South Koreans have supported the U.S. military presence in their country as a deterrent against the Communist North . <p> Although there is a link between a North Korean military threat and the South Korean views of the USFK , many people see North Korea as the problem of Korean nationalism . Former U.S. ambassador to the ROK James T. Laney stated in April 1995 , " For South Koreans , North Korea is not a foreign policy or a security issue  --  it is an emotionally charged domestic political issue . " ( n23 ) Thus , when the relationship between the two Koreas is strained , the presence of U.S. forces has not been a subject of discussion in South Korea , and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the South and the North have eased , national self-reliance has been emphasized and an anti-U.S . mood has prevailed . In other words , the more harmonious those inter-Korean voices grow , the more Seoul has to rework its strategic relationship with the United States . <p> Recently , anti-Americanism has surged in South Korea with an atmosphere of reconciliation between the two Koreas . The historic inter-Korean summit between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , which was held in Pyongyang from 13 through 15 June 2000 , provided the impetus for such rapprochement . As the North Korean threat began to recede , many South Koreans wondered whether they should continue with the inconvenience of U.S. troops . Indeed , this thaw between the two Koreas provided a convenient platform for those who always opposed the U.S. military presence to promote their cause among the broad spectrum of the South Korean public . <p> President George W. Bush 's definition of North Korea as part of the " axis of evil " angered many who support reunification in South Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pyongyang regime than at the North Koreans . They have criticized hard-line U.S. policy for making the Communist regime drag its feet on budding rapprochement with the South . Pyongyang has stayed away from the dialog table with Seoul on the pretext of Washington 's hard-line policy toward it . Those who support pro-reunification have asserted that Koreans ' desire to end their national division is challenged by a U.S. desire to keep a hegemonic grip on Northeast Asia . In early September 2002 , a pro-reunification lawmaker maintained that " America 's aggressive policy has forced South Koreans to change their perception of what an ' ally ' means . In the past , a country that helped deter a war on the Korean peninsula was an ally . But now , only those who contribute to promoting inter-Korean peace , reconciliation and unification should be considered our ally . " ( n24 ) Those who promote reunification no longer regard North Korea as the enemy . Even the North 's admission that it has a clandestine nuclear weapons program has not altered their position ; indeed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would make Americans less arrogant . <p> But the current situation on the Korean peninsula is not different from that of the past . North Korea has the desire and the capability to develop nuclear weapons , to build and to export medium-range missiles , and to build and to stockpile biological and chemical weapons . Nothing has changed with respect to the North Korean threat because Pyongyang continues its " military first " policy and its goal to reunite the Korean peninsula under the Kim Jong Il regime ? ( n25 ) The North 's admission in October 2002 that it had continued its nuclear weapons program using enriched uranium demonstrated the gravity of such a threat from North Korea . Many South Koreans are asking , " Is North Korea a major threat or an object of cooperation ? " Although the definition of North Korea as the " main enemy " is believed by a majority of South Koreans , this viewpoint can not be changed because the threat of another war has not yet completely disappeared . However , South Koreans also want increased interchanges between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of their northern " brothers " so reunification is achieved . As in the past , the perceptions of North Korea will directly influence South Korean views of U.S. forces . " Anti-Americanization " of South Korean Society <p> In late 2002 , the single biggest issue in South Korea was not North Korea 's secret nuclear weapons program but anti-Americanism . After the acquittal of the two U.S. soldiers , protesters surrounded the U.S. embassy in Seoul and representatives of various Korean NGO organizations went to the United Nations in New York and to the White House to display signs stating " U.S. troops out of Korea . " The number of Koreans who sympathize with anti-Americanism is growing rapidly . The situation was so serious that a survey by the American-based Pew Research Center found that Americans thought South Korea to be the " Asian nation most critical of the United States . " ( n26 ) <p> In fact , the past several years have witnessed the de facto anti-Americanization of South Koreans . A look at reader comments on articles on Internet sites of Korean newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . To these opinionated netizens , Washington , not Pyongyang , is the problem because it is an " evil empire " bent on dividing and weakening Korea . <p> A Korean Catholic priest on a hunger strike a block away from the U.S. Embassy in downtown Seoul , protesting the acquittal in late 2002 , who had been a leading anti-American activist since the 1980s , maintained the anti-American movement had changed over the years : " It was really a minority movement twenty years ago . Now it has widespread public recognition . There is an angry wave sweeping the country today . " He mentioned South Korean resentment of the U.S. military presence in the country : " The public does admit some necessity of the U.S. troops here , but it has begun to demand a fair alliance . Without fairness , the U.S. military ca n't be an ally  --  it is an occupation force . " ( 27 ) <p> In fact , a few years ago , anti-American activists commonly were viewed as radical leftists or " Reds . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , and anti-Americanism was regarded as equal to pro-Communism . At that time , the movement against the United States was a risky mission and attracted little support . The country was politically conservative and the authoritarian regimes of the time suppressed free expression of such views . <p> But recently anti-Americanism has become a national issue and is taken seriously by Seoul and Washington . The Korean public sees no risk in expressing anti-Americanism because of democratization of South Korean society ; they are free to express their feelings , including resentment . " American arrogance " has increased public sympathy for anti-U.S. , feelings . Many Koreans , especially the younger generation , think their country deserves more respect from its primary ally . Today anti-Americanism is no longer limited to a few radicals or ideologues but has spread among the people in all age groups and professions . <p> The anti-Americanization of South Korean society is closely associated with its increasing inclination to the left. ( n28 ) At the end of the 1980s , any attempt to realize leftist ideologies had been seen as destructive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accepted as long as it does not damage the country 's security . The number of the " progressives "  --  specifically , the pro-reunification force-is increasing rapidly . In South Korea , the best way to understand persons ' ideologies is to look at their feelings toward the United States and North Korea . Today the ideological median is not to yield to the two countries but to maintain a balance . Viewed in this light , a significant number of South Koreans , including former president Kim Dae-jung and incumbent president Roh Moo-hyun , who are cool toward Washington and enthusiastic about Pyongyang , are inclined to the left ? ( n29 ) As a result of Kim Dae-jung 's high-profile efforts to engage Pyongyang , many South Koreans are more skeptical of the United States , their long-time ally , than they are of heavily armed North Korea and believe the United States , not North Korea , is the bigger threat to their country . Some of Roh Moo-hyun 's supporters have suggested a division of labor between North Korea and South Korea in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South takes charge of the economy . <p> It is important to consider the rapid democratization of South Korean society to understand Koreans ' changing perceptions of the USFK . The criticism of U.S. forces has not been totally due to Koreans ' anti-American inclinations because a majority of Koreans still support the continued stationing of the troops in their country . In particular , the SOFA is based on the presence of U.S. forces . Without the USFK , there would not be a SOFA . <p> Recently , many Koreans have criticized American troops for the inconvenience incurred by their presence . Thus , Koreans have developed the movement to revamp the SOFA and to move the Yongsan base out of their capital . In their democratization movement , they have attempted to eliminate a number of authoritarian " sanctuaries , " dismantle the privileged few , and claim their inherent rights ; the targets include the privileged classes and organizations , regardless of their nationalities  --  the USFK among them . The people involved in the movement believe the time has passed when U.S. troops enjoyed privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Korean peninsula . Democracy , therefore , is the crux of the problem of the USFK . The South Korea-U.S. military alliance and arrangements governing the U.S. military presence , particularly the Yongsan base and the SOFA , are products of Korea 's past authoritarian governments . The alliance itself never has stood the " democracy test " it now faces . Conclusion <p> In recent years , the relationship between South Korea and the United States has faced challenges from both within and without , and fundamental and dramatic changes have created a vastly altered context of the relations between the two countries . Domestic changes in South Korea , particularly rapid economic growth and recent political democratization , have triggered great transformation of the Korean-U.S. relationship . Friction has been inevitable between the two nations , and as a result anti-Americanism has increased among Koreans . <p> Anti-Americanism at first was the domain of radical students who protested " U.S. imperialism " and U.S. support for Korean dictatorship with demonstrations and firebombs . Although some of the same types of protests still surface occasionally , today anti-Americanism has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived failure of the United States to reward and to respect South Korean accomplishments . <p> There is no opportune moment for anti-Americanism , but the present is a sensitive moment for South Korean-U.S. relations to sour . The North Korean nuclear problem is unclear . Because of tensions between the South Korean governments ( the past Kim Dae-jung administration and the present Roh Moo-hyun administration ) and the U.S. government over the U.S.-North Korea policy , the relationship between the two countries could be severely damaged if anti-American protests spread . Even if the North Korean nuclear problem is not resolved , the South Korean-American alliance faces a serious readjustment . As a result of a series of remarks questioning the structure of the ROK-U.S. military alliance by President Roh Muhyun and an upsurge of intense anti-Americanism , U.S. officials moved swiftly to press Seoul on plans for relocating U.S. forces . Those plans were based in part on new military concepts in Washington calling for a ground force more maneuverable than the massed infantry . In early 2003 , U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said American troops would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the redeployment of 14,000 infantry personnel from positions along the DMZ to the area south of the Han River or the topic of downsizing the USFK were under discussion in Washington . In early March 2003 , Rumsfeld revealed that U.S. forces could be completely moved out of South Korea at any time. ( n30 ) In mid-March , a high-ranking Pentagon official said the trip wire function of U.S. troops near the DMZ was outdated and Washington would relocate the Second Infantry Division stationed at Tongduch'on , some 15 miles southeast of the inter-Korean Military Demarcation Line , to south of the Hah Riven He ' added that if South Koreans wanted the removal of American forces from their country , they would leave " at any time , even tomorrow .

The troop reduction process was stopped by the nuclear crisis initiated by Pyongyang in 1993 , but the plan is still in effect . Large-scale U.S. troop reduction would be a fundamental readjustment in the alliance between the two countries . <p> It would be dangerous if anti-Americanism triggered a U.S. decision to initiate a realignment of American forces , in particular a partial or full withdrawal , without regard to resolving the status of North Korea 's nuclear program . The scale and speed of U.S. troop withdrawal must depend on the level of tension on the Korean peninsula , the progress of South-North Korean relations , and improvements in South Korea 's military preparedness . The anti-American movement must not lead to the large-scale withdrawal of U.S. forces from Korea because this is not in the best interests of South Korea and the United States ; also , despite their intermittent outcries against some aspects of American troops , a majority of South Koreans still want the continued U.S. military presence ( n33 ) South Koreans should recognize the reality that their country heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , above all , national defense
