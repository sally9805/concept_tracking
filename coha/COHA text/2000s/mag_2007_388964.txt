Photograph : PHOTOGRAPHY BY KEITH SCOTT MORTON In the dining room , Nancy exposed the beams and had the old pine floors cleaned but not refinished , to keep their patina . Everyday dinners are more likely to take place at the gateleg table in the " keeping room . " Strawberry flowers in old pharmacy bottles add color to a monochromatic palette . Nancy enlarged the opening from the keeping room to the kitchen , adding salvage-yard antique posts where needed . RUG : WOODARD WEAVE . Part detective , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of houses who excels at uncovering a dwelling 's original attributes while bringing the interiors gloriously into the present day . She found this project , a 1795 clapboard house on 20 acres in Woodbury , Conn . " The property took my breath away , " says Nancy . " I opened the gate and knew this was it . " She also saw great potential in the house , despite its dark exterior and warren of low-ceilinged rooms . She ripped out the dropped ceilings , stripped plaster and lathe down to the posts and beams , and opened up many of the rooms with wider doorways and additional windows . Nancy completely redesigned the kitchen and converted three small rooms upstairs into a spacious master bedroom and bath . Then she filled the house with furnishings in her trademark white palette , enriched with soft grays that seemed to suit the New England locale . " This house is much simpler than my previous homes , " says Nancy . " As you gain experience , you realize less is really more . " BEFORE : The exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun porch windows , and planted an all-white " moon garden " with hollyhocks and hydrangeas . The kitchen feels refreshingly open and airy , thanks to the white-and-gray palette and the absence of upper cabinets . Nancy added a medley of distinctive pulley lights from Europe , and an antique dish rack dated 1865 that was , she says , " the perfect weathered gray . " Blending old and new BALANCE " I 'm thinking about two things when I look at an old house , " says Nancy Fishelson : " Keeping the integrity of the original architecture , and satisfying my desire to open up spaces and bring in light . You have to balance the two . " SALVAGE " If I need to replace or patch old beams or flooring , I look for existing pieces to borrow from another area of the house or at architectural salvage yards . " BRIGHTEN Nancy widened room openings , joined neighboring rooms , and added windows and French doors to bring in more light . She chooses not to obscure windows with curtains or blinds , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use white for interiors , " says Nancy . " I find it creates a clean , fresh slate . " BEFORE : In the kit-chen , Nancy replaced two small casement windows and brick walls with a bank of twelve-over-eight windows , lifted the ceiling and added the beams . She nabbed bargain cabinets on eBay , painted the maple bases white , and added Fireslate countertops . Each " found " object finds its particular place . In the sun porch , an old dollhouse overlooks an antique child 's bed . The gleaming copper tub in the master bath was another eBay find . Old sinks delight Nancy , too , including the soapstone sink for the laundry/mudroom and the porcelain apronfront sink in the ( surprise ! ) master bedroom . Nancy took three small rooms upstairs , each of which had only one small window , and combined them to make a spacious master bedroom and bath . To fit windows above a shed roof in the back , she had to tuck them right up against the ceiling beams , " but those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she observes . The chair to the right of the old iron bed is called a " make do chair , " which is to say , someone added an upholstered back and wings to a ladder-back chair to form an unusual yet charming hybrid . <p>
