In June 1938 Virginia Woolf published Three Guineas , her brave , unwelcomed reflections on the roots of war . Written during the preceding two years , while she and most of her intimates and fellow writers were rapt by the advancing fascist insurrection in Spain , the book was couched as the very tardy reply to a letter from an eminent lawyer in London who had asked , " How in your opinion are we to prevent war ? " Woolf begins by observing tartly that a truthful dialogue between them may not be possible . For though they belong to the same class , " the educated class , " a vast gulf separates them : the lawyer is a man and she is a woman . Men make war . Men ( most men ) like war , since for men there is " some glory , some necessity , some satisfaction in fighting " that women ( most women ) do not feel or enjoy . What does an educated-read : privileged , well-off-woman like her know of war ? Can her recoil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " difficulty of communication , " Woolf proposes , by looking together at images of war . The images are some of the photographs the beleaguered Spanish government has been sending out twice a week ; she footnotes : " Written in the winter of 1936-37 . " Let 's see , Woolf writes , " whether when we look at the same photographs we feel the same things . " She continues : // This morning 's collection contains the photograph of what might be a man 's body , or a woman 's ; it is so mutilated that it might , on the other hand , be the body of a pig . But those certainly are dead children , and that undoubtedly is the section of a house . A bomb has torn open the side ; there is still a bird-cage hanging in what was presumably the sitting room ... // The quickest , driest way to convey the inner commotion caused by these photographs is by noting that one ca n't always make out the subject , so thorough is the ruin of flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her conclusion . We do have the same responses , " however different the education , the traditions behind us , " she says to the lawyer . Her evidence : both " we " - here women are the " we " - and you might well respond in the same words . // You , Sir , call them " horror and disgust . " We also call them horror and disgust ... War , you say , is an abomination ; a barbarity ; war must be stopped at whatever cost . And we echo your words . War is an abomination ; a barbarity ; war must be stopped . // Who believes today that war can be abolished ? No one , not even pacifists . We hope only ( so far in vain ) to stop genocide and to bring to justice those who commit gross violations of the laws of war ( for there are laws of war , to which combatants should be held ) , and to be able to stop specific wars by imposing negotiated alternatives to armed conflict . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aftershock of the First World War , when the realization of the ruin Europe had brought on itself took hold . Condemning war as such did not seem so futile or irrelevant in the wake of the paper fantasies of the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 , in which fifteen leading nations , including the United States , France , Great Britain , Germany , Italy , and Japan , solemnly renounced war as an instrument of national policy ; even Freud and Einstein were drawn into the debate with a public exchange of letters in 1932 titled " Why War ? " Woolf 's Three Guineas , appearing toward the close of nearly two decades of plangent denunciations of war , offered the originality ( which made this the least well received of all her books ) of focusing on what was regarded as too obvious or inapposite to be mentioned , much less brooded over : that war is a man 's game-that the killing machine has a gender , and it is male . Nevertheless , the temerity of Woolf 's version of " Why War ? " does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rhetoric , in its summations , rich in repeated phrases . And photographs of the victims of war are themselves a species of rhetoric . They reiterate . They simplify . They agitate . They create the illusion of consensus . // Invoking this hypothetical shared experience ( " we are seeing with you the same dead bodies , the same ruined houses " ) , Woolf professes to believe that the shock of such pictures can not fail to unite people of good will . Does it ? To be sure , Woolf and the unnamed addressee of this book-length letter are not any two people . Although they are separated by the age-old affinities of feeling and practice of their respective sexes , as Woolf has reminded him , the lawyer is hardly a standard-issue bellicose male . His antiwar opinions are no more in doubt than are hers . After all , his question was not , What are your thoughts about preventing war ? It was , How in your opinion are we to prevent war ? // It is this " we " that Woolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow her interlocutor to take a " we " for granted . But into this " we , " after the pages devoted to the feminist point , she then subsides. // No " we " should be taken for granted when the subject is looking at other people 's pain . // * * * // Who are the " we " at whom such shock-pictures are aimed ? That " we " would include not just the sympathizers of a smallish nation or a stateless people fighting for its life , but-a far larger constituency-those only nominally concerned about some nasty war taking place in another country . The photographs are a means of making " real " ( or " more real " ) matters that the privileged and the merely safe might prefer to ignore . // " Here then on the table before us are photographs , " Woolf writes of the thought experiment she is proposing to the reader as well as to the spectral lawyer , who is eminent enough , as she mentions , to have K.C. , King 's Counsel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . Imagine then a spread of loose photographs extracted from an envelope that arrived in the morning post . They show the mangled bodies of adults and children . They show how war evacuates , shatters , breaks apart , levels the built world . " A bomb has torn open the side , " Woolf writes of the house in one of the pictures . To be sure , a cityscape is not made of flesh . Still , sheared-off buildings are almost as eloquent as bodies in the street . ( Kabul , Sarajevo , East Mostar , Grozny , sixteen acres of lower Manhattan after September 11 , 2001 , the refugee camp in Jenin ... ) Look , the photographs say , this is what it 's like . This is what war does . And that , that is what it does , too . War tears , rends . War rips open , eviscerates . War scorches . War dismembers . War ruins . // Not to be pained by these pictures , not to recoil from them , not to strive to abolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be the reactions of a moral monster . And , she is saying , we are not monsters , we members of the educated class . Our failure is one of imagination , of empathy : we have failed to hold this reality in mind . // But is it true that these photographs , documenting the slaughter of noncombatants rather than the clash of armies , could only stimulate the repudiation of war ? Surely they could also foster greater militancy on behalf of the Republic . Is n't this what they were meant to do ? The agreement between Woolf and the lawyer seems entirely presumptive , with the grisly photographs confirming an opinion already held in common . Had the question been , How can we best contribute to the defense of the Spanish Republic against the forces of militarist and clerical fascism ? , the photographs might instead have reinforced their belief in the justness of that struggle . // The pictures Woolf has conjured up do not in fact show what war , war as such , does . They show a particular way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as " barbaric , " in which civilians are the target . General Franco was using the same tactics of bombardment , massacre , torture , and the killing and mutilation of prisoners that he had perfected as a commanding officer in Morocco in the 1920s . Then , more acceptably to ruling powers , his victims had been Spain 's colonial subjects , darker-hued and infidels to boot ; now his victims were compatriots . To read in the pictures , as Woolf does , only what confirms a general abhorrence of war is to stand back from an engagement with Spain as a country with a history . It is to dismiss politics . // For Woolf , as for many antiwar polemicists , war is generic , and the images she describes are of anonymous , generic victims . The pictures sent out by the government in Madrid seem , improbably , not to have been labeled . ( Or perhaps Woolf is simply assuming that a photograph should speak for itself . ) But the case against war does not rely on information about who and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evidence enough . To those who are sure that right is on one side , oppression and injustice on the other , and that the fighting must go on , what matters is precisely who is killed and by whom . To an Israeli Jew , a photograph of a child torn apart in the attack on the Sbarro pizzeria in downtown Jerusalem is first of all a photograph of a Jewish child killed by a Palestinian suicide-bomber . To a Palestinian , a photograph of a child torn apart by a tank round in Gaza is first of all a photograph of a Palestinian child killed by Israeli ordnance . To the militant , identity is everything . And all photographs wait to be explained or falsified by their captions . During the fighting between Serbs and Croats at the beginning of the recent Balkan wars , the same photographs of children killed in the shelling of a village were passed around at both Serb and Croat propaganda briefings . Alter the caption , and the children 's deaths could be used and reused. // Images of dead civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe , as did the hourly reruns by Al Jazeera , the Arab satellite television network based in Qatar , of the destruction in the Jenin refugee camp in April 2002 . Incendiary as that footage was to the many who watch Al Jazeera throughout the world , it did not tell them anything about the Israeli army they were not already primed to believe . In contrast , images offering evidence that contradicts cherished pieties are invariably dismissed as having been staged for the camera . To photographic corroboration of the atrocities committed by one 's own side , the standard response is that the pictures are a fabrication , that no such atrocity ever took place , those were bodies the other side had brought in trucks from the city morgue and placed about the street , or that , yes , it happened and it was the other side who did it , to themselves . Thus the chief of propaganda for Franco 's Nationalist rebellion maintained that it was the Basques who had destroyed their own ancient town and former capital , Guernica , on April 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a later version , by dropping bombs manufactured in Basque territory ) in order to inspire indignation abroad and reinforce the Republican resistance . And thus a majority of Serbs living in Serbia or abroad maintained right to the end of the Serb siege of Sarajevo , and even after , that the Bosnians themselves perpetrated the horrific " breadline massacre " in May 1992 and " market massacre " in February 1994 , lobbing large-caliber shells into the center of their capital or planting mines in order to create some exceptionally gruesome sights for the foreign journalists ' cameras and rally more international support for the Bosnian side . // Photographs of mutilated bodies certainly can be used the way Woolf does , to vivify the condemnation of war , and may bring home , for a spell , a portion of its reality to those who have no experience of war at all . However , someone who accepts that in the world as currently divided war can become inevitable , and even just , might reply that the photographs supply no evidence , none at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valor and sacrifice have been emptied of meaning and credibility . The destructiveness of war-short of total destruction , which is not war but suicide-is not in itself an argument against waging war unless one thinks ( as few people actually do think ) that violence is always unjustifiable , that force is always and in all circumstances wrong-wrong because , as Simone Weil affirms in her sublime essay on war , " The Iliad , or The Poem of Force " ( 1940 ) , violence turns anybody subjected to it into a thing . No , retort those who in a given situation see no alternative to armed struggle , violence can exalt someone subjected to it into a martyr or a hero . // In fact , there are many uses of the innumerable opportunities a modern life supplies for regarding-at a distance , through the medium of photography-other people 's pain . Photographs of an atrocity may give rise to opposing responses . A call for peace . A cry for revenge . Or simply the bemused awareness , continually restocked by photographic information , that terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tyler Hicks that The New York Times ran across the upper half of the first page of its daily section devoted to America 's new war , " A Nation Challenged , " on November 13 , 2001 ? The triptych depicted the fate of a wounded Taliban soldier in uniform who had been found in a ditch by Northern Alliance soldiers advancing toward Kabul . First panel : being dragged on his back by two of his captors-one has grabbed an arm , the other a leg-along a rocky road . Second panel ( the camera is very near ) : surrounded , gazing up in terror as he is being pulled to his feet . Third panel : at the moment of death , supine with arms outstretched and knees bent , naked and bloodied from the waist down , being finished off by the military mob that has gathered to butcher him . An ample reservoir of stoicism is needed to get through the great newspaper of record each morning , given the likelihood of seeing photographs that could make you cry . And the pity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from asking what pictures , whose cruelties , whose deaths are not being shown . // * * * // For a long time some people believed that if the horror could be made vivid enough , most people would finally take in the outrageousness , the insanity of war . // Fourteen years before Woolf published Three Guineas - in 1924 , on the tenth anniversary of the national mobilization in Germany for the First World War-the conscientious objector Ernst Friedrich published his Krieg dem Kriege ! ( War Against War ! ) . This is photography as shock therapy : an album of more than one hundred and eighty photographs mostly drawn from German military and medical archives , many of which were deemed unpublishable by government censors while the war was on . //
