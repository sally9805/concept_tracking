It was a cold and somber day . Nearly a quarter of the labor force was out of work . Banks had shut their doors . Farms were going belly up . Breadlines snaked through city streets . Standing jut jawed at the lectern before the Capitol 's assembled throng on his first Inauguration Day , Franklin Delano Roosevelt countered the sense of helplessness , telling the shaken nation , " The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . " He then outlined a plan of economic revolution : bank and stock-market reforms , public-works programs , and emergency relief for farms . But the day 's solemnity made room for celebration too , as Roosevelt answered cheers by shaking his hands over his head like a prizefighter . Later he wagged his top hat at marchers in the Inauguration parade , including four men pushing lawn mowers , a gibe at outgoing President Hoover 's remark that if Democrats won , grass would grow in the streets .  --  By Margot Roosevelt New Deal           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
