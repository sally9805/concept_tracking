A Storm Warning <p> Sage <p> Yucatn , the present day <p> MTrida is an ancient city , sensual and sophisticated . I loved it on sight and dreamed of getting lost there , a fantasy that haunts me still . <p> As special guests , our wooden chairs had been placed on a small dais in the center of tiny Parque Santa Lucfa . Sitting in the front row , making notes , I watched couples dance on an improvised stage . Dark-suited men darted like moths . Women in white whirled coquettishly , trays of champagne glasses delicately balanced on their heads . <p> I knew about balancing acts , have gotten good at them . Not now , not tonight , I pleaded to  --  to whom ? Ixchel ; this was her territory . I want to have fun tonight , I told the Mayan moon goddess . This is my time . <p> Leaning back , I fluttered a sandalwood fan against the sultry night , savoring the quaint old park with its graceful archways and lush plantings . The mariachi band sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When lightning sliced the sky I sat up with a start . A low roar echoed in the distance , barely discernable . Thunder crashed above me now . How quickly the weather changes in Yucatn . The first , fast drops of rain pelted my hair , splashed my face . Companions were already up and running . Behind us was a narrow street , beyond that our hotel . Two group members were halfway there , our leader shepherding the rest across deepening rivulets of rainwater . <p> I turned back to the stage and saw male dancers scatter in all directions . The women performers , gowns sodden now and clinging , looked uncertainly at one another , hands raised to trays still balanced on their heads . A goblet slid off , shattering on ancient paving stones . Mariachis grabbed their instruments and ran from the bandstand . Thunder crashed again , long and ominous . <p> Another fiery bolt slashed the horizon . " Sage , are you coming ? " someone called to me from across the street . Hesitating , I looked again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their twice-told tales . So tedious . Lost luggage in Guadalajara , leaky toilets in Taxco . I ran  --  in the opposite direction . The mariachis were disappearing into a cantina on the far side of the square . El Troubabor . Liking the sound of it , I hurried toward the blinking Christmas tree lights that marked the bar 's lofty stone entryway . My high heels slipped on rough stones . An experienced traveler should have known better , but I could n't resist the slinky shoes waiting so long in my closet . <p> Pushing open the elaborately carved wooden door , I rushed inside , glad to be out of the rain , a smooth marble floor beneath my feet . Too smooth . I slid , missed a step , and pitched forward into the dark , smoky room . An awful moment , tumbling in slow motion . I fell headlong , or would have , if a stranger 's arms had n't reached out and caught me . For the tiniest moment I relaxed against his shoulder . . . . How good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long had it been ? <p> " Are you all right ? " the man asked in American English . He looked a little younger than me , early forties , perhaps ; tall , rangy , and smiling softly . I 'd never seen him before , yet felt in some crazy way that I knew him , might even have been waiting for him . <p> " I 'm fine . " I stepped back , wobbly , embarrassed . The room was filled with people , all of them looking at us . " Thank you , " I gasped . <p> " Come , join me . " He gestured toward the ornate mahogany bar where his drink waited , something dark and sparkling in a snifter . <p> Still shaky , I settled onto a bamboo stool , its back thickly padded with embroidered pillows . Mayan designs : Ixchel , my favorite , alongside ferocious snouts and plumed serpents . <p> My reflection stared back from the cloudy mirror behind the bar . Wide eyes , wary like a startled cat . I took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silken whimsy had failed to cover . Good haircuts are hard to come by ; I was glad to have one . <p> " +Una margarita , seora ? " the bartender asked , his ring-heavy hands already busy pouring . <p> " Sf , por favor . " <p> " You speak Spanish ? " the man beside me asked . <p> " Espaol por tontos . " <p> " +Tontos ? " <p> " Dummies  --  it gets me by . " <p> The mariachis , grouped in a corner , tuned up instruments that seemed none the worse for the shower . Much of the brass was dented , the tuba tarnished , but the brave sound raised my spirits immediately . Tasting the salt from the glass 's rim , I looked about the cantina : intimate , heavy with history ; faded elegance , but still inviting . This was the colonial part of town , the adobe walls a good five hundred years old . I liked the ancient grillwork at the windows , the bright woven rugs scattered across the tile floor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw poignant reminders of Mexico 's turbulent past . These were the heroes of the revolution : men in white with broad sombreros , bandoliers bristling with bullets , rifles ready . Young , unformed faces with fierce dark eyes . I picked up a bar napkin , jotted a few hurried notes , and looked up to see my rescuer watching me . <p> " This is a nice place to remember , " he nodded . One eyelid seemed a little heavier than the other , slightly engaging , a wink waiting to happen . " The mariachis end up here nearly every night to play their own favorites . Will you be in town long ? " <p> I shook my head . " No . Here today , Chichen Itza tomorrow , then Cancn ; finally , Campeche . " <p> " Oh , you 're on a tour . " <p> " Sort of . I 'm the person who gets people to want to take tours . Now , is that a good thing ? " I swirled the liquid in my glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzled , I explained : " I 'm a travel writer . My current magazine assignment is Mexico 's romantic destinations . " Actually , I thought , he was rather romantic . Dark blue eyes , penetrating ; slim hips ready for the ghost of a gun belt . <p> He nodded at the wall of photographs that I 'd been examining . " You consider revolutionaries romantic ?
