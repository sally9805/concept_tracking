A Xi'an gang broke into the 2,000-year-old tomb of China 's Empress Dou and made off with a slew of rare artifacts . Here 's how : <P> 1 Near Empress Dou 's burial mound , raiders use a TANGAN to take soil samples , which indicate the exact location of the 131 ft. by 131 ft. tomb , buried deep underground <P> 2 To speed up the digging , the gang blows out a crater at the surface with dynamite . They are careful not to set off the charge directly over the tomb  --  the impact might collapse the roof <P> 3 A tunnel 115 ft. deep is excavated . The gang uses ropes to lower members and gear into the hole . An AIR BLOWER powered by a PORTABLE GENERATOR pumps in fresh air from the surface <P> 4 To reach the tomb 's roof , the raiders begin digging a 40-ft. spur tunnel at 98 ft. below <P> 5 The raiders saw through the tomb 's wood-plank roof . Wearing GAS MASKS , the gang now has access to the burial chamber  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Imperial gravediggers surround tombs with charcoal and dried mud for protection against moisture <P> Only cypress wood was used , probably for its ability to absorb water <P> Statues symbolize the servants , soldiers and maidens who served the royals in life <P> Empress Dou 's coffin is surrounded by a wooden structure called huangchang ticou , a burial method reserved for Han dynasty emperors and their wives and concubines <P> TOOLS OF THE TRADE <P> GAS MASKS Filter out stale air and noxious gases  --  built up during centuries of decay  --  inside the tomb <P> TANGAN This special shovel , which has a curved blade and steel screw-on handle extensions , can extract soil samples from 115 ft. below the earth 's surface <P> AIR BLOWER An industrial electric fan pumps fresh air down the tunnel shaft to ventilate the burial chamber <P> PORTABLE GENERATOR The diesel-powered machine produces electricity to run fans and lights <P> Sources : Xi'an Municipal Public Securities Bureau ; Shaanxi Archaeology Research Institute ; China 's Buried Kingdoms ( TIME-LIFE Books )            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
