Do n't mean to make you paranoid , but you could be spooking your man in the sack . Fear not , we 'll fill you in on his passion peeves so you can steer clear . // Passionate and pleased are looks you want to see on your guy 's face in the heat of the moment . Panicked is n't . Yet even the most self-assured man can get shaken up during sex if you do or say something that jolts him out of his comfort zone , explains William Fitzgerald , Ph.D. , a sex therapist in Santa Clara , California . And if you think the guy you 're bedding down with is immune to being wigged out during the act , you 're sadly mistaken . " If women had any idea how vulnerable men are about their sexuality , they 'd be a lot more gentle with them in the bedroom , " says Lou Paget , sex educator and author of The Big O. To avoid erotic errors that 'll make him say " Ugh " instead of " Ohhh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during , and afterplay faux pas . NUMBER 1 coming on too aggressively Most guys dig girls who embrace their sexuality and are carnally creative , but being more forward than the Jacuzzi girls from Meet My Folks could bug him out big-time . We 're not saying you should forsake your fearless female self for a passive persona . Just do n't whip out your vibrator too soon or pressure him to do more than he 's willing to . " I practically went through the Kama Sutra-twice-at my girl 's request , " says Rodolfo* , 27 . " She just kept asking , " What next ? " Then we 'd switch positions and she 'd ask again . Trying to keep up with her was more work than fun , so my " unit " just quit on me . " Plus , when you barrage your guy with sex requests ( or spring XXX moves on him ) , it can make him feel that you need these erotic extras to be turned on by him . " If your man is n't secure about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make him feel threatened , " says Julian Slowinski , Psy.D. , coauthor of The Sexual Male , who adds that your man may also feel like he ca n't match your stamina . And if he 's not up for the challenge , you 'll both miss out . So how do you know if taking a lascivious lead will rattle your guy ? Try some brave moves before you hit the bedroom , like grazing his twins with your hand or grabbing his butt while you 're kissing , then asking him how it felt . If he pulls away or acts less than enthusiastic , turn the temperature down a notch . NUMBER 2 mentioning another man Repeat after us : I will never , ever use the words " My ex used to ... " or " A guy I once dated would ... " or " This one time in Vegas , the bellboy and I ... " when you 're in bed . It may seem like a harmless little detail you 're sharing , but guys totally take it personally . " Telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive him crazy , " says Paget . " There will be a videotape on endless loop in his head of you having sex with someone else . " Aaron , 28 , got downright startled when his ex-girlfriend brought a book of kinky sex suggestions into the sack and mentioned she 'd leafed through it once with her ex . " I felt like she was saying , " My ex is so great ! Look what we did together , ' while we were lying there naked , " remembers Aaron . " What guy wants to hear that or have to compete with that in bed ? " And the same thing goes for mentioning your favorite sex scene starring Brad Pitt ... unless you happen to be Jennifer Aniston . NUMBER 3 crying Sometimes sex is so good that it 'll bring tears to your eyes . But it 's this simple to a guy : Tears equal bad . That 's because your man may not be able to tell the difference between tears of pleasure and tears of anguish , and that confusion can send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to read the situation when a woman is suddenly emotional in bed , " says Slowinski . So even though carnal crying is a spontaneous reaction that you 're more than entitled to display , he 'll assume the worst if you do n't fill him in ASAP . And beyond that , he might get totally turned off . " Nothing freaks me out more than a woman who cries during a hookup , " says Michael , 27 . " One time , I set up this candlelit dinner with a girl , and we drank a ton of wine . Later , when we were having sex , I guess the alcohol made her emotional because she started bawling right as I was having an orgasm ! I know it sounds bad , but afterward , I just wanted to run for the door ... and it was my apartment . " NUMBER 4 staying silent Worse than crying in bed is not making a peep . You may worry that belting out your wildest sex noises will make you sound like a hyena in heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to please you , so they need some response to find out if they 're hitting the right spots or making the right moves . Play mute and they 'll worry that they 're the worst lay you 've ever had . " Absence of feedback makes a guy wonder , Am I doing something , wrong ? " explains Fitzgerald . " Your silence feeds his self-doubt , and when a guy feels insecure about whether he 's pleasing you , chances are , he 'll pull away . " Case in point : " I once dated this gorgeous dancer who was very proper , but I figured that once we were in bed , her prim facade would fall away and she would be an animal . Wrong ! " says Tyrone , 30 . " She was totally silent while we were having sex , so after a while , I just stopped . Sex is supposed to be a fun sharing experience , but this was n't . If a woman is n't saying anything , a guy 's gon na assume she 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you pipe up and let your sex sounds rip-whether you 're moaning or telling him how amazing he 's making you feel-your guy is going to be doubly turned on . He 's with a sexy , energetic chick and getting verbal kudos for doing something right . The bonus : By giving him audio feedback when he 's touches you right , you get exactly what you want too . NUMBER 5 staring him down As sexy as soul-gazing sounds , staring deeply and unwaveringly into the eyes of your man for more than 30 seconds at a time could be more cringe-inducing for him than picking up your yeast-infection meds for you . " Women maintain good eye contact with guys because it makes them feel more connected in bed . But for many men , overdoing it can be too direct and off-putting , " says Fitzgerald . " He can feel scrutinized or examined , like he 's being evaluated . " And when he 's trying to relax and get his love groove on , being judged will do anything but jack up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your man think you want to get too serious , too fast . " I 'd only been dating this girl for a month , but every time we had sex , she 'd play this psycho staring game where she 'd never break my gaze or even blink , " says Chris , 26 . " It made me have to shut my eyes or look away . It was like she thought that if she kept looking at me , I 'd blurt out " I love you " or something . Definitely not a turn-on . " A stare down can also make him feel like he 's on the basketball court and has two seconds left to sink the best three-pointer of his life . " It freezes me up when a girl just keeps looking at me , especially when she 's on top , " says Adam , 22 . " What does she expect me to do ? Am I not satisfying her ? All these questions start rushing through my head . " And no guy wants to sweat that much between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you 've forged a more intimate connection outside of the bedroom . Sidebar Rewind ! How to bring the mood back after a between-the-sheets blunder BUTTER HIM UP . Say that you were so out-of-your-mind turned on by his body/moves that you got carried away and accidentally called him the wrong name . Cap it off with another ego-stroker about his bedroom skills . DOWNPLAY IT . Generally , guys do n't like to overanalyze , especially in the sack . And blabbing about what you did wrong ( like mentioning your ex ) may magnify the problem . So breeze over the issue-chances are , he 'll move on . BE HONEST . Sometimes admitting that you know you went a little overboard-whether it 's surprising him with new crazy moves or having an emotional outburst-may take him off the defensive .
