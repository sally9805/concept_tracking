Section : SPECIAL REPORT <p> What if the American Heart Association endorsed the trans-fat diet ? Problem , right ? <p> Look at what the American Diabetes Association is spoon-feeding people with diabetes sugar . <p> Not to worry : We 've got the solution right here . <p> IT 'S A WONDER NO ONE HAS TRIED TO have Mary Vernon 's medical license revoked . <p> Since 1999 , the 52-year-old family doctor has been treating diabetic patients in Lawrence , Kansas , with an approach that was abandoned by most physicians in the 1930s . Worse , this Depression-era remedy is the opposite of the current guidelines established by the American Diabetes Association , a nonprofit organization that spent nearly $51 million on research in 2005 , and so should know a thing or two about how to handle diabetes . <p> There 's no question that Dr. Vernon is trouble  --  but for whom ? Not her patients , that 's for certain . They just wo n't stay sick . People walk into her office afflicted with type-2 diabetes and , by every objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million that says that is n't supposed to happen , not in a clinic in Kansas , and definitely not as a result of cleaning out the refrigerator . <p> " My first line of treatment is to have patients remove carbohydrates from their diets , " explains Dr. Vernon , a petite , energetic mother of two who also serves as the president of the American Society of Bariatric Physicians . " This is often all it takes to reverse their symptoms , so that they no longer require medication . " <p> That 's it ? <p> That 's it  --  a simple strategy , but one that 's controversial . If Dr. Vernon and a growing cadre of researchers are correct about carbohydrates , we may be looking at an epic case of ignorance on the part of the medical community . That , however , pales next to the implications for the American Diabetes Association , namely that the very organization dedicated to conquering diabetes is rejecting what could be the closest thing we have to a cure . <p> +++ <p> ALTHOUGH NOT AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 , its prevalence in the United States has risen by 47 percent , a trend that 's expected to take a space-shuttle trajectory in the next decade . That 's because nearly half of American men today either have the condition or are on the verge of developing it , according to a new report from the National Institutes of Health . And the consequences are considerable : Diabetes is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease , slashing a man 's life span by an average of 13 years . Dodge early death and you could still end up impotent , blind , in kidney failure , or , most likely , minus a foot . ( A gangrenous limb or digit is amputated every 6 minutes in the United States . ) <p> " This is a ' grab your muskets , fellas , the wolves are at the door ' scenario , " says David Katz , M.D. , an associate professor of public health at Yale University school of medicine . " What once was ' adult-onset ' diabetes  --  a condition mostly of overweight , sedentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the age of 10 . " <p> So what exactly is diabetes ? In freshmanbiology terms , it 's a disease of the hormone insulin . Secreted by your pancreas , insulin moves glucose  --  the form of sugar your body uses for energy  --  from your bloodstream into your cells . Problems arise , however , when , often due to excessive weight gain , your cells start to become resistant to the effects of insulin . ( It knocks no one answers . ) As a result , more insulin is required to dispose of the same amount of glucose . ( The knock becomes a loud banging . ) This condition , called insulin resistance , is the first stage of type-2 diabetes . <p> As insulin resistance worsens over time , your pancreas has to pump out enormous amounts of insulin to force glucose into your cells . ( Hey , let 's use a sledgehammer ! ) Eventually , your pancreas has trouble keeping up , leaving you with chronic high blood sugar , a.k.a. hyperglycemia  --  the defining marker of diabetes and the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it only gets worse from here : If the resistance continues to mount , some of the insulin-producing beta cells inside your pancreas can " burn out " and stop working altogether . ( In type-1 diabetes , an autoimmune disorder destroys most or all of the beta cells . ) Once beta cells burn out , you 're looking at a lifetime of daily insulin injections . <p> Or not , if you believe Dr. Vernon . <p> Unlike protein , fat , and fiber  --  which have little if any impact on blood sugar  --  carbohydrates such as starch and sugar are quickly broken down into glucose during digestion , which is then absorbed into your bloodstream . The more you eat , the higher and faster your blood sugar rises . Therefore , if you have diabetes , it would make sense to control your blood sugar by limiting your carbohydrate intake . Another benefit of consuming fewer carbs is that you often end up consuming fewer calories , and that can help lower weight , which , in turn , reduces insulin resistance . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes build their diets around bread . Okay , not just bread . In explaining the foundation of its Diabetes Food Pyramid , the ADA Web site  --  the public face of the organization  --  states , " This means you should eat more servings of grains , beans , and starchy vegetables than of any of the other foods . " And while high-fiber whole grains are emphasized , a slice of whole-wheat bread is still more than 80 percent starch . <p> Granted , sweets are at the pinnacle of the pyramid , though so are " fats " and " oils , " which makes it appear that the ADA 's main focus is n't on high blood sugar at all but rather on a different affliction . <p> " Long-term , what you 're really concerned about is heart disease , " says Marion Franz , R.D. , a member of an 11-person team of experts who coauthored the ADA 's 2006 nutrition recommendations . " It 's the major cause of death for people with diabetes . " In other words , they use food as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabetes itself . <p> When it comes to controlling blood sugar , the ADA seems to push drugs as hard as diet . An ADA position statement published in August 2006 advises that people newly diagnosed with type-2 diabetes immediately commence taking metformin , an oral medication that slows the body 's internal production of glucose , helping to lower blood-sugar levels . With total sales of met formin having neared $1.1 billion in 2005 , according to IMS Health , this recent recommendation must have brought a big smile to big pharma  --  and a look of utter disbelief to the faces of the ADA 's critics . <p> " They 're contradicting themselves , " says Richard Feinman , Ph.D. , director of the Nutrition &; Metabolism Society and a professor of biochemistry at SUNY Downstate medical center , in New York City . " They want diabetics to take medication to lower their blood sugar , but recommend a diet that has the opposite effect . " <p> At least the ADA 's recommendations are pointing in the same direction in the case of overweight people with diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise to reduce insulin resistance . What 's odd here , however , is that they do n't advise giving the lifestyle component a chance to work before reaching for the pill bottle . <p> " Metformin is insurance for people who are n't following their diet and exercise plan , " explains John Buse , M.D. , Ph.D. , president-elect of medicine and science for the ADA . <p> The message to insulin-resistant America : We do n't think you 're going to help yourself , so here , take this . <p> +++ <p> WHEN BRIAN LONG AWOKE COVERED IN HIS own blood , he knew it was time to see a doctor . The boil that had been festering on his right thigh for 2 months had finally ruptured . On the recommendation of a friend , the 30-year-old business owner made an appointment with a local doctor . Luckily , her name was Mary Vernon . <p> " As soon as I saw the type of boil Brian had , it was obvious to me that he had diabetes , " recalls Dr. Vernon , explaining that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heal  --  are one of the few outward signs of diabetes . A glucose test provided the necessary confirmation : Long 's blood sugar was 360 milligrams per deciliter , almost four times higher than normal . <p> Dr. Vernon instructed Long to adopt a low-carbohydrate , high-fat diet instead of the ADA 's well-established dietary guidelines . His condition reversed  --  and fast . In just 3 months , he was no longer diabetic . And this was without ever taking a single dose of metformin or injecting insulin . <p> " My treatment did n't seem like a treatment , " says Long . " All I had to do was change my eating habits . " <p> This turnaround may have amazed Long , but Dr. Vernon is more matter-of-fact about the remedy and the results . " I believe in addressing the cause , not the symptoms , " she says . " That 's why I first eliminate the foods that raise blood sugar . It 's only logical . " <p> So logical , in fact , that Elliott Proctor Joslin , M.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century ago . According to carefully documented patient logs he kept from 1893 to 1916 , Dr. Joslin successfully treated dozens of diabetic patients  --  including his own mother  --  using a diet made up of 70 percent fat and just 10 percent carbohydrates . <p> Then , in 1921 , a Canadian scientist named Frederick Banting found that by injecting diabetic dogs with insulin , he could lower their blood sugar back to normal . Soon after , insulin therapy made the leap from these hyperglycemic hounds to human beings . By the 1940s , insulin was in widespread use , and low-carbohydrate diets were on the decline . Dr. Joslin was later labeled a medical reactionary . <p> " Instead of advising people with diabetes to first restrict carbohydrates , physicians simply started prescribing enough insulin to accommodate patients ' carbohydrate intake , " says Dr. Vernon , who some 60 years later is trying to pick up where Dr. Joslin left off and reeducate academics and physicians by sharing her observational evidence . In published , retrospective reviews of her patients ' medical charts , Dr. Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet for more than 60 people who had diabetes or were at high risk of developing the disease . <p> Of course , in the world of medicine , the experience of one doctor carries little scientific weight compared with experimental studies conducted under controlled conditions . That 's why , in 2003 , researchers at Duke University set out to test Dr. Vernon 's findings in a laboratory setting . The results of their 16-week study : 17 out of the 21 diabetic patients who participated were able to significantly reduce their medication or discontinue it altogether . <p> " When you cut out carbohydrates , reducing insulin and other diabetes medications is n't just a benefit , it 's a necessity , " says William Yancy , Ph.D. , lead author of the Duke study . " Otherwise , blood-sugar levels would drop too low . " <p> +++ <p> " YOU NEED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DIETARY carbohydrate to provide enough fiber , minerals , and vitamins , " says the ADA 's Dr. Buse , when asked why a person with diabetes would want carbohydrates , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Why risk a nutritional deficiency in someone with a chronic health condition ? Except this is exactly the gamble you 'd take if you ate according to the ADA 's own Diabetes Food &; Nutrition Bible . An analysis of the high-carbohydrate , low-fat plan , presented last January at a conference of the Nutrition &; Metabolism Society , showed that it did n't provide the recommended dietary allowances ( RDA ) of four essential nutrients : potassium , iron , vitamin D , and vitamin E. The ADA diet , in fact , was deficient . <p> The culprit ? The plan 's 2,000-calorie limit , says Judith Wylie-Rosett , Ed.D. , R.D. , a coauthor of the ADA 's 2006 nutrition recommendations . " The more you restrict calories on any diet , the harder it is to get the nutrients you need from food . " <p> It might be hard to imagine how a high-fat , low-carbohydrate diet would be any more nutritious , even if the calories were in the right range . But that 's only because most of us have a skewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think low-carb means low-produce . In truth , many vegetables contain very few carbohydrates per serving , and most of those are the fibrous kind , which hardly budge blood sugar . So vegetables are not only acceptable but encouraged on a low-carb diet . <p> Dr. Vernon , for example , recommends that most of her diabetic patients eat vegetables at every meal . Dr. Joslin , back in 1893 , proposed that patients simply limit their vegetable intake to those containing " less than 5 percent carbohydrate content , " which he identified as spinach , tomatoes , asparagus , broccoli , and 23 other choices . And in a survey of more than 2,000 low-carb dieters , Feinman discovered that 80 percent actually consume greater amounts of vegetables than they did before they adopted the approach . <p> More bizarre than the ADA 's general recommendation of carbohydrate consumption , though , is the organization 's stance on sucrose , commonly known as table sugar . According to the ADA , there 's no need for people with diabetes to restrict their intake of the sweet stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raising blood sugar , sucrose is no worse than starch . <p> " That 's an almost devious justification , " says Feinman . " Starch may be the worst food you can eat in terms of controlling blood sugar . " <p> A bit of chemistry : Sucrose is composed of equal parts of two simple sugars , glucose and fructose . The former is the same glucose that circulates in your bloodstream . As such , it 's already in the form your body needs , so it 's easily digested and quickly raises blood sugar . Fructose , however , has to be converted to glucose in your liver . This slows down the rate at which it 's digested , and reduces its impact on your blood sugar . <p> Starch , on the other hand , consists almost entirely of glucose . In fact , think of starch  --  the primary carbohydrate in bread , rice , pasta , and other flour-based foods  --  as a bundle of glucose molecules , held together by chemical bonds . These bonds start to dissolve the moment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter your bloodstream . As a result , starch has an even greater impact on blood sugar than sucrose ; essentially , it 's like injecting glucose before your shot of insulin . " The ADA 's implication is that likening sugar to starch is a favorable comparison , " says Feinman , " when it 's actually the opposite . " <p> The ADA 's sanctioning of sucrose  --  as well as that of starch  --  does come with one caveat : " Intake must be adequately covered with insulin or other glucose-lowering medication . " That sounds like you can eat all the sugar you want , as long as you take enough drugs . <p> " We 're not saying it 's okay for people with diabetes to eat lots of sweets , " says Franz . " But they deserve the right to eat all types of carbohydrates , just like any other person . " Never mind that the need for more medication usually indicates that a disease is worsening . " This is like saying it 's all right to eat contaminated spinach just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +++ <p> THE MOST OBVIOUS OBJECTION TO TREATING diabetes with a low-carbohydrate diet that 's high in fat is that , well , it 's high in fat . After all , saturated fat is cardiac kryptonite , right ? <p> Wrong , says Jeff Volek , Ph.D. , R.D. , a nutrition researcher at the University of Connecticut . " Our research indicates that replacing carbohydrates with saturated fat has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health , " he explains . " A low-carbohydrate diet decreases the body 's production of saturated fat and increases its ability to burn the incoming dietary fat . " In fact , says Volek , more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies published since 2003 show that a low-carbohydrate , high-fat diet is more effective at reducing overall heart-disease risk than a high-carb , low-fat regimen . And , just like the diet that Dr. Vernon prescribes , each of these meal plans ranged from 50 percent to 70 percent of total calories from fat . <p> Still , opponents argue that while the number of these studies may make a compelling case for following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What works in the short term has not always been proven to be beneficial in the intermediate and long term , " says Dr. Buse . " In an organization such as the American Diabetes Association , you have to be data-driven , not opinion-driven . " <p> Translation : If there is n't published evidence of how a diet performs in what Dr. Buse calls the intermediate term  --  which he defines as a study that lasts 3 to 6 years  --  the ADA wo n't support it as a treatment option . Which means all the short-term studies that Volek cites  --  and the clinical experience of doctors such as Dr. Vernon  --  do n't count in the ADA 's world , even though low-carbohydrate diets have produced only positive findings . <p> " I think the onus should be on the ADA to show data that suggests low-carbohydrate diets are n't beneficial in the intermediate term , " says Feinman . " All evidence we have suggests otherwise , including epidemiological . " <p> Feinman is referring to studies on Greenland Eskimos , who prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart disease and diabetes on the planet . One 25-year study found that only one out of the 1,800 people monitored developed diabetes . Their diet : almost entirely fat and protein , and only about 3 percent carbohydrates . <p> Even with all the accumulating evidence , there 's no doubt that the high fat content of low-carbohydrate diets is worrisome for many people . And this may be why more physicians do n't advocate the approach , even though many follow it themselves : A University of Pennsylvania study reports that doctors prescribe a low-fat diet to their patients 67 percent of the time , yet when it comes to their own diet , they more often go low-carbohydrate . <p> +++ <p> AT THE MCDONALD 'S AT 6TH AND WAKARUSA in Lawrence , Kansas , the employees have to fill some unusual orders , like when Brian Long strides in and asks for a double cheeseburger  --  hold the bun . <p> In the nearly 10 months that Long has been following Dr. Vernon 's dietary advice , he 's picked up a few tricks for staying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every McDonald 's , though he prefers the one on Wakarusa . " Here , the cashier does n't look at you funny when you order it , " he says . " Maybe it 's because it 's only a few blocks from Dr. Vernon 's clinic . " <p> Long does n't realize it , but according to many nutrition experts , cutting carbohydrates from his diet was supposed to fall somewhere between impractical and impossible . Most people with diabetes simply ca n't or wo n't do it . " An extreme diet does n't work well in the long term , " says Franz . <p> " Which do you think people would find more practical ? " asks Dr. Vernon . " Avoiding bread and sugar , or taking an insulin shot every day ? " Before you answer , consider that the ADA , America 's leading authority on diabetes , refuses even to pose this question to millions of diabetes sufferers , leaving them unaware that there may actually be an alternative to leading a medicated life . <p> " You might prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dr. Vernon . " But in my experience , patients are far healthier and happier without it . " She pauses for a moment . " And is n't that the whole point ? " Diabetes by the decades <p> Since of diabetes has risen 765 percent . In that period , consumption of refined carbs in the form of corn syrup  --  the main sweetener in soda  --  increased 20-fold per person . Now imagine how this timeline would look if carb control , not insulin , had been the treatment of choice .

One caution : If you 're currently taking medication for high blood pressure or high blood sugar , consult your physician first , as this diet will cause both to drop . THE RULES <p> Eat until you 're satisfied , not stuffed . <p> Do n't skip meals , especially breakfast . <p> Include protein , such as meat , cheese , and nuts , with every meal and snack . THE FOODS <p> Vegetables : Down as many as four servings a day of nonroot vegetables . That means broccoli , asparagus , spinach , and any other leafy green vegetable . One serving is 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cup cooked ( half a ball ) . <p> Meat and eggs : Eat as much of these foods  --  which include poultry and fish  --  as you want ( i.e. , until you 're full ) . <p> Cheese : Have up to 4 ounces of hard and firm cheeses daily  --  for instance , Parmesan , American , and Cheddar . One serving is about the size of two dominoes . <p> Fruit : Limit yourself to 1 cup of berries or melon a day . <p> Nuts : One ounce a day . EXTRAS <p> ( Help yourself ) <p> Condiments : Mustard , horseradish , soy sauce , and Tabasco sauce . <p> Salad dressings : Oil and vinegar , and full-fat dressings  --  such as ranch  --  that contain no more than 2 grams of carbohydrates per serving . <p> Oils : Olive and canola are best ; use only small amounts of other oils . <p> Beverages : Drink 64 ounces of water a day . Then consume only two servings of diet soda per day and unsweetened tea and coffee as desired ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to customize your meal plan , go to MensHealth.com , keyword diabetes .
