Section : World Report A rare visit to North Korea 's capital city finds life is hard and illusions prevail <p> PYONGYANG , NORTH KOREA  --  The Youth Heroic Highway is the capital city 's pride , a 10-lane showpiece lined with massive monuments . The government finished it less than two weeks before the visit of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  --  by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of its youngest workers . " Every night , there were rows and rows of children in the pitch black , pounding away with hammers , " says one longtime resident . " But already , sections are falling apart . " <p> To impress their American guests , the North Koreans trotted out their best performers , threw on the lights in a usually dark city , and paved over their problems . But , like the heroic highway , this is a society on the verge of breaking . <p> The city is like a movie set , one omnipotent director 's warped vision of utopia . Huge sports stadiums and concrete apartment blocks line clean , wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary songs on the sidewalk to inspire their comrades . Colorful murals shout , " Let Us Be Armed With Socialist Ideals ! " The only thing lacking in this workers ' paradise is life . Buildings are largely empty in a city that is supposedly home to 2 million people . Factories lie dormant , without electricity or fuel to power production . There is no litter on the streets . Policewomen in powder-blue suits and heavy makeup stand in the middle of intersections , spinning on their heels and pointing their batons mechanically . Their job is to direct traffic in lieu of the perpetually dark stoplights , so they do it , even though the few cars on the streets are driven by military men who speed by , ignoring police and pedestrians alike . <p> Since the country stopped receiving aid from the Soviet Union 10 years ago , everything has been put on pause . Descending into the bomb shelter turned subway is like finding the buried remains of Soviet-era Eastern Europe . The trains are , in fact , from East Germany , still sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only additions are two familiar portraits hanging at one end : the late " Great Leader " Kim Il Sung and his son , the ruling " Dear Leader " Kim Jong Il . Passengers sit quietly with their hands folded . When the power cuts off , as it often does , they wait in the darkness for hours . <p> Across the street , the No. 1 Department Store contains shelf after shelf of the same dust-covered goods  --  tin cups , toy tanks , rubber galoshes in primary colors . A few schoolchildren wander around peering at the plastic bottles of perfume , but no one buys anything . One fluorescent bulb casts an eerie blue light across the entire floor , a boarded-up escalator in the middle . <p> Scrounging for rice . So where is everyone ? Busy trying to survive . On the road leading out of the city , lines of men and women of all ages trudge along , cloth bags stuffed with vegetables and potatoes balanced on their backs and heads . They are walking as far as hundreds of miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itinerants huddle around piles of burning leaves to keep warm . In the winter , thousands of women and children are mobilized to scrape the ice off these roads on their hands and knees . Now , the old women carefully sweeping the ground with handfuls of straw are just scrounging for kernels of rice that may have fallen off passing trucks . <p> Hundreds of thousands have already died from a famine that struck the country in the mid-1990s . The World Food Program , whose donations come chiefly from the United States , now feeds 8 million people , or about a third of the nation 's population . <p> The problem is not only lack of food but lack of hope . " North Koreans suffer from mass depression . They have no future , no ideas , and nothing to live for , " says Norbert Vollertsen , a physician with the German medical aid group Cap Anamur , who has lived in the country for a year and a half . " All day , they are just waiting . . . . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to do , men spend their days drinking low-quality alcohol and smoking , and as a result most over the age of 50 are dying from liver or lung cancer . The elderly and handicapped are not visible because people die young . Surgeries are performed by candlelight , without anesthesia , in unheated rooms with wires running across wet concrete floors . In the university hospital , considered to be the best in the country , the intravenous drip is made from a used beer bottle . Women line up for abortions because they can not feed more than one or two children but also can not afford contraception . <p> Perks for the elite . Still , the elite have no incentive to change the system . They live in gated compounds , in ivy-covered buildings surrounded by grassy lawns . For entertainment , they have a world-class golf course designed by Japanese architects and a bowling alley , all payable in dollars . During celebrations , one Western resident says , the parking lot of the Cultural Palace is a sea of the newest models of Mercedes-Benz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , as he courts diplomats from around the world ? Will he undo the self-imposed isolation that makes people wary of speaking to foreign visitors ? What will happen when people who have spent the last half century worshiping Kim Il Sung 's creed of juche ( self-reliance ) take a look beyond the set , when they learn of the riches just over the heavily fortified border with South Korea ? <p> For now , Kim 's moves are cautious and limited . But some experts see vast economic potential if he eases the nation 's rigid , Stalinist control and unleashes its people 's energy for productive purposes . " If someone pressed a button , it could be like China in the late 1970s , " says a diplomat stationed in the city . For that , the North Korean people doubtless will have to wait awhile longer . <p> " It 's like they are waiting for Godot .
