Do not adjust your screens . That dark chap crooning beside a bosomy , winged model in a Venetian palazzo in a new Victoria 's Secret commercial is Bob Dylan . The counterculture bard who once sang of " Advertising signs that con you " is now a TV pitchman . Recruited for his " confidence and gravitas , " according to a Victoria 's Secret spokesman , Dylan plays his 1997 song Love Sick in the spot ( in which , coincidentally , parts of models seem to defy gravitas ) . His record label called the ad " a great way to reach people with Bob 's music . " It 's also a great way to hang out with lingerie models . We suspect Rod Stewart is already dialing his agent .
