THE BEGINNING <p> Listen , I tell you a mystery : We will not all sleep , but we will all be changed- in a flash , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed . 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 <p> There are certain rules to surviving a horror movie ... Never , ever , ever under any circumstances say , " I 'll be right back . " Because you wo n't be back . Jamie Kennedy , Scream <p> GOODLAND , KANSAS <p> One week from tomorrow , at precisely 6:11 in the morning , the rapture or apocalypse or Armageddon or whatever else you 'd prefer to call it , is going to occur . <p> But only in Goodland , Kansas . <p> The rapture will not take place anywhere else in the world . It will not crash the stock market , cause cars to wreck , or leave planes without their pilots . Husbands will not leave for the kitchen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the living room and discover that their wives are now nothing more than piles of clothes . Power plants will not shut down , leaving televisions , light bulbs , street lamps , and hairdryers without electricity . Running water will not stop , forcing citizens to take baths in rivers and wash their clothes in lakes . Meteors will not crash into the ocean and create tidal waves . Nuclear missiles will not be launched from the USSR , North Korea , East Germany , or any of those pesky countries in the Middle East . Barcodes will not be tattooed onto wrists or foreheads . The number 666 will be nowhere in sight except for those rare instances when a customer at McDonald 's buys nothing but a Filet O ' Fish and a medium strawberry shake , and the total including tax comes out to be six dollars and sixty-six cents . A world government will not be formed . Computers will not melt down because they are confused about what the year 2000 actually means . Aliens will not blow up the White House . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like this will happen anywhere but in Goodland . <p> This goes against conventional wisdom . Most people think that when the end comes it will be widespread : Trumpets will sound and horsemen will appear and it will be a whirlwind of all kinds of tribulation-from pre-trib , to post-trib , to middle-trib . But that does n't make sense . It 's just not how such things work . It 's not true to the pattern of how other miraculous destruction has occurred in history . <p> There are always warning signs . <p> God did n't simply destroy Nineveh-Jonah was swallowed by a whale and then sent to warn Nineveh of its impending doom . Moses warned Pharaoh before the plagues hit-and even the plagues started out innocently enough , simple stuff like frogs and locusts before the heavy hitters like blood rivers and death angels . Peter warned Ananias and Sapphira , Lot warned Sodom and Gomorrah-and in the end they were all destroyed to warn others about the dangers of wickedness . <p> This is what will happen in Goodland . Their rapture will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sacrificial lamb . It makes sense . Once everyone sees how powerful the rapture is , they will be afraid , or excited ; they will hit the floor and repent of their sins . Everyone , everywhere , will know the truth . Not only that , but this event will provide God a chance to see how things go . He can look at the rapture and see what worked and what did n't . He can watch the good , the bad , and the ugly of the apocalypse so He can know how to improve it when He takes it global . <p> Goodland is the test market for the rapture . <p> The ultimate warning sign for all to repent . <p> WILL HENDERSON <p> Will was running late . At this rate he 'd never make it home in time for dinner . And this was n't just dinner . This was Monday night dinner . This was the most important meal of the week for the Henderson family . The meal for which his mom spent the whole day cooking things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistachio fruit salad . <p> Will knew he should have left Nate Jackson 's house sooner . But Nate had just returned from a family trip to Kansas City where he got the most impressive set of brand-new , mint-condition DC graphic novels Will had ever seen . " Look how cherry these are , " Nate said as he opened the cellophane packaging and slowly took out the comics . Nate was right . These were cherry . Batman and Superman looked lifelike on these pages . No , they looked better than lifelike . Every detail on every page was breathtaking . Otherworldly . How could someone be expected to keep track of time when looking at comics like this ? <p> " Can I read it ? " Will asked . <p> " Yeah , just be real careful . Mom said I 'm not even supposed to open these because they 're so nice . " <p> Will sat on the edge of Nate 's bed and flipped the comic books open . He turned to one page after another , reading about the adventures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , and at that moment he was lost in thought about Batman . Will felt bad for Batman . The Flash could move at the speed of light , Wonder Woman had an invisible jet , and Superman had a ridiculously unfair amount of powers ( flight , laser vision , X-ray vision , wind breath , super strength-and those were just his basic powers-it seemed like he could just come up with a brand-new power whenever he needed it ) . And then there was Batman . He had exactly zero superpowers . He was rich . He had a lot of money . His trust fund was his power . He could buy really cool cars and planes and bat gadgets that could do anything and everything . But Batman could n't do anything for himself . Will thought all the other superheroes probably looked at Batman like he was a poser . Batman was the rich kid who had to buy his way into the Super Friends club . That must have made Batman really sad . Will thought Batman probably lay in bed late at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other superheroes said . Batman probably would even look towards the heavens and pray , " Please God , give me some kind of superpower . It does n't have to be much . Just the ability to jump over a building or become invisible or shoot beams of ice or fire out of my hands . " <p> Will was almost in a trance flipping through the pages thinking about Batman when Nate said , " Dude , do n't you have to be home ? It 's almost dark . " <p> Will looked up at the clock . " Shoot . I got ta go . " He jumped off Nate 's bed , ran down the stairs , and opened the door to leave . " See you later Mrs. Jackson , " Will said . <p> " If the Lord tarries , " Mrs. Jackson called from the kitchen . <p> Once Will was out of Nate 's house he started walking home down the gravel road . The road was on the outskirts of Goodland and on either side were large cornstalks as tall as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even at his quick pace he would n't make it home in time . His family lived so far away from everybody . <p> Still , he needed to make it home in time . This was Monday night dinner . This was a huge deal . So , the only chance he had to make it home before he was grounded for the next month was to cut across the cornfields . <p> Will stepped into the fields and knew that if he walked in a straight diagonal line , he would cut at least twenty minutes off his walk home . He 'd just have to keep walking quickly and he 'd be there in no time . He 'd be there before his mom could call Nate Jackson 's mom and ask where he was . Will did n't like when his mom talked to Nate 's mom . They always talked about religious things . <p> Of course most people talked about religious things in Goodland . Will had visited some of his cousins in Denver last summer and noticed that no one around there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " when they said goodbye . But in Goodland that was just how most people said goodbye . Kind of like saying " Geshundheit " after someone sneezes . But the thing is , most people say " Geshundheit " after you sneeze . It seemed to Will that no one said " If the Lord tarries " anywhere else in the world . He wanted to make sure so he tested the theory out a month ago when his family visited Worlds of Fun amusement park in St. Louis . The teenager buckling Will into the roller coaster told him , " Have a good ride . " And Will answered , " If the Lord tarries . " <p> The teenager looked at Will as if he were from Neptune . <p> On their road trip home from the amusement park , Will asked his mom , " How come nobody else talks like we do ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " his mother answered . <p> " Nobody in Denver or at Worlds of Fun says things like , ' If the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> " That 's because they 're not concerned with the rapture , " his mother said . <p> " Oh . " <p> " You know what the rapture is , do n't you ? " <p> Of course he knew what the rapture was . Everybody knew what the rapture was . He 'd heard about it lots of times in Sunday school . People around town talked about it every once in a while . And from the way people talked , Will always worried that it was coming soon . That made Will scared . He did n't want to die . <p> Not that it was really dying . Or was it ? He 'd have to go away . His life on earth would be over . Is n't that essentially what dying is ? Does it matter if you skip the pain ? Or is the pain part of dying ? Do you have to experience something bad like a bullet through your chest or a car wreck or liver cancer or AIDS or burning or drowning ? Is that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the things that Will liked about the rapture . He 'd get to skip the pain part of dying . It was like God would hit fast forward or skip to the next chapter , and he 'd be whisked away to some magical place with clouds and harps and singing . He 'd be whisked away to heaven . <p> So it was n't really heaven that bothered him-it was just that there was so much here that he had n't experienced . He had n't graduated and thrown his cap high into the air . He 'd never learned to drive or been able to pick up a girl by himself on prom night . He would n't be able to go on a camping trip with just his friends like they 'd always planned they would when they were old enough . He had n't ever owned his own house , or had a job where he made lots of money that he could spend on video games and guitars and flat screen TVs . <p> Worst of all , he 'd never even had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other guys at school said they had . And he 'd certainly never had the S - word with a girl . And he sort of wanted to do that too . Not until he was older . Not until his wedding night , and maybe not until a while after that . The S - word sounded crazy and weird and like a lot of fun , but also kind of scary and intimidating for Will right now . <p> But it would n't always be scary . Someday he would be ready . <p> Still , he did n't think about the S-word much , but he thought about his wife all the time . He wondered what she would look like . She 'd probably have blonde hair and she 'd like to play soccer or volleyball . Will even wondered if he knew his wife right now . Sometimes , during math when the teacher was writing long division problems on the board , he 'd look around the classroom and wonder if his wife was sitting in class with him . Was she a few desks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday , once they were married , they 'd talk about math class and tell each other , " That 's where I first noticed you , in math , during those super boring lessons . That 's when I knew we 'd be married . " But that day would never come . He 'd never get to have that conversation with his wife . He 'd never even get to know who his wife really was . <p> He 'd probably be raptured before then . <p> And that was n't fair . This was a point Will often brought up in his prayer time . " God , why ca n't you wait until I 'm old , like twenty-five , until you bring the rapture ? Let me do some of the stuff that people have gotten to do for thousands and millions of years before me . Is n't that fair ? " And then Will felt like God spoke the answer to him : No , that was n't fair . The rapture had to come someday ; it could n't wait until everyone turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , there were some people who were babies or little kids and they 'd never get to experience all the good stuff Will had . They 'd never get to ride a bike , or white-water raft , or go see the Kansas City Royals play live and in person . He should consider himself lucky he 'd gotten to do all of that . Even more , he would be very lucky that the rapture was going to happen in his lifetime . He was special . <p> And then he stopped . <p> He looked around . He was so deep in thought about the rapture and Worlds of Fun and his future wife that he 'd lost his place in the cornfields . <p> Where are you ? There was barely any sunlight left . He was n't even supposed to be in the cornfields . If his parents knew that he 'd cut across the cornfields , he could n't imagine how grounded he would be , but it would be bad . He would probably still be grounded after the rapture . The adults did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched on as far as the eye could see , in every direction , rows and rows of endless cornstalks like trees in a forest . Will could navigate them ; he 'd done it before , but he had to pay careful attention to the subtle changes and markers along the way . And he thought he was paying attention . But all the thoughts of the rapture crept in and distracted him . It happened to him sometimes . Emily made fun of him because of it . His mom said it was n't his fault . One thought could jump onto another and another . But she also said just because it was n't his fault did n't mean he would n't have to fight against it . She said he needed to pay attention , and that was n't easy ; that 's why they called it paying . <p> He was paying attention now . <p> He knew exactly what to do to get out of the fields ; he had n't been so lost in his thoughts that he 'd completely lost his bearings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then right five hundred steps , and then left six hundred steps . Like that , he 'd be out of the cornfields . He could run home , he 'd be there before dark-he 'd outrace the sun if he had to . Then he could go back to normal things like worrying about the rapture . <p> He started counting each step . He knew right where he was the whole time , and once he got near his last few steps he could feel the outside world , taste the fresh air , and imagine what it would look like outside of the green and yellow and brown blur he 'd been staring at for the last half hour . And as he walked out of the cornfields something odd happened . <p> There was more corn . <p> The six hundredth step looked just like every other step . He had n't left the fields at all . He closed his eyes and listened . Surely he could hear people playing and talking ; there would be cars driving on the road , and these sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscalculated . But he was close . He just needed a little help to guide him the rest of the way . <p> He listened-and-nothing . <p> Now he was going to have to do something that would give him away . He 'd have to yell . And then everyone for sure would know that he was in the cornfields . They would tell him , " I told you so . This is exactly why we say , ' Do n't play in the cornfields . ' " He would tell them he was n't playing , he knew exactly where he was . He just got a little distracted . But those logical explanations would fall on deaf ears . <p> That was a price he was willing to pay . " Is anybody out there ? " Will said , loudly and confidently without quite yelling it . There was still a shred of hope that someone would be nearby , someone who 'd guide him out of the fields so he could avoid trouble . <p> " Anybody ? " He half-yelled again . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much more about dying of thirst in the cornfield . He knew that you died of thirst way before you died of hunger , which seemed weird to Will because he usually felt hungry a lot more than thirsty . <p> So this time he yelled , " Please , I 'm lost . I need some help . PLEASE ! " <p> Silence . Someone could hear him . They were just trying to prove a point . They were trying to teach him a lesson . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
