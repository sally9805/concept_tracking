1 . Alyssa Snyder Is Troubled Lissy Snyder hated nature , especially its lavish variety on the eastern end of Long Island . All those sudden winged or crawly creatures everywhere , feeding on one another and on you , too , if you were n't vigilant . Ants in the pantry , moths batting at the lamps , something living or dead plucked discreetly from the pool every day . And then there were the piano-tuner birds that shrieked or sang the same two notes incessantly , and the ones that seemed to be typing in the woods behind the house . Once in a while , Lissy stood at the spruce-lined border of the property and yelled " Shut up shut up shut up ! " just to get a little peace and quiet . But they would begin again the moment she turned her back , like a rowdy junior high school class mocking a substitute teacher . She had sweet-talked Jeffrey into buying a beach house while they were still on their honeymoon , a time he would have gladly agreed to anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she had n't bargained for the rampant flora and fauna in Sagaponack . That was supposed to be upstate somewhere , or in New England , where wildlife belonged , where rabid bats were as common as houseflies , and bears were said to be driven mad by menstruating women . In Lissy 's childhood memory of an idyllic Southampton summer , before her father left , before the death ofher beloved nanny , there was a vast velveteen lawn skirting her cousins ' house and , behind it , the sand dunes that led to the sea , and everything that lived there knew its place : the lobsters in their traps or in a citrus vinaigrette , the other secrets of the deep kept appropriately secret . Fireflies flashed around the porches at night , accompanied by the strumming of hidden crickets , but they 'd seemed pretty harmless ; her Grandmother Ellis had called their performance " a charming petit son et lumire . " Now , on a balmy June day during her second Sagaponack season , Lissy peered anxiously into the patio garden . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her summer reading club , the Page Turners ; she 'd already plumped the cushions in the screened gazebo , where they convened . The group was led by Angela Graves , who 'd taught English Lit at some tiny women 's college in Texas a million years ago . Ardith Templeton had found her through an ad the previous winter in the East Hampton Star . " Enhance your summer with the company of great books . Retired professor of literature will lead the way . " The flowers that Pedro and his crew tended were nice enough , fragrant and colorful , except for all the bees they attracted , and the way their brief blooming reminded Lissy of her own mortality . She would turn twenty-eight in October , and although none of her mirrors , not even the cruelly lit and magnified one on her dressing room table , had yet hinted at the ravages of aging or even the slightest dimming of her crisp blondness , she felt that her shelf life had begun to expire . Maybe all that required reading-never her strong suit-was undoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Angela herself , who must have faced the sun fearlessly all her life and was now a bas-relief of age spots and wrinkles . Lissy had felt flattered when Debby and Joy , whom she knew from yoga class in the city , invited her to join the book club . And she was thrilled when they 'd accepted her offer of a designated meeting place , along with the name she had come up with for them . The original Page Turners had been the group for slower readers she 'd been made to join in the third grade at the Betsy Ross Day School , where the letters of the alphabet had a habit of reversing themselves to her , and she often had to be coaxed into concentration . But she did n't mention any of that to her current book group friends . Everyone in the Hamptons wanted to get to know beautiful and aloof Ardith better . She was like those savvy , popular girls at school in whose orbit Lissy had dizzily spun without ever coming any closer to them . And Larry Templeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisioned a brilliant , career-enhancing friendship evolving from this casual connection , and Jeffrey 's astonished pride in her . Every other Tuesday since Memorial Day , Angela Graves drove her blue Chevy Neon from The Springs to Lissy 's more desirable neighborhood and sat among the dewy-skinned young members of the grown-up Page Turners , a veritable bulletin from their grim future . Some of the books she extolled were equally grim Victorian novels , in which infants or their new mothers routinely died and , not surprisingly , sexual repression was the rage . Lissy had been thinking , on and off , about having a baby . Not that she was beset by maternal yearnings , but perhaps it was time . It was n't as if she had a real career to interrupt ; even she knew that being a part-time , freelance party planner was n't a serious or inspired pursuit . The sprinkling of referrals she 'd had so far had been favors from business acquaintances of Jeffrey 's : a couple of toddlers ' birthday parties , an anniversary dinner for someone 's senile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the honorees equally insensible . Besides , a few of Lissy 's friends had started families already , bucking the national trend of waiting until your ovaries dried up and fell off . She might well be in on the beginning of a new trend . It astonished her sometimes that she made so many crucial decisions this way , guided by arbitrary social patterns rather than passion . But it was how she 'd been raised , as if everything depended on some invisible , incontestable clock . Time for dinner , hungry or not . Time for bed ( ditto for sleepiness ) . Time for school , let go of Mummy 's hand , Alyssa ! Time for deflowering . Time to get married . And why not ; how did you ever know if you were really in love , anyway ? Still , starting a family might be inconvenient , or worse , and especially complicated right now . If , as Angela Graves suggested , Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein was merely an elaborate metaphor for childbirth , what could one expect ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda , who would require all of her energy and concentration , during the final weeks of the summer , after their mother brought them back from a European trip . Lissy could play at mothering then , if those beautiful but daunting children allowed it , and make an informed decision for once . Why , it might even be fun . She was supposed to have finished reading Can You Forgive Her ? for today 's session of the Page Turners , although it was incredibly long and printed in such microscopic type . Angela had given them the title back in January , just after they 'd first signed up , instructing them to start reading it then , but Lissy had n't gotten around to it right away . And now , flailing to catch up , it seemed more like winter reading to her-that endless blizzard of pages flecked with the blown soot of words . She skimmed as quickly as she could through the chapters that dealt with politics and money , in favor of the romantic passages . But even sounding out the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Glencora , Plantagenet-badly fatigued her . Imagine saddling a child with a name like Plantagenet ! The bloated little paperback had been wedged open and propped against the sugar bowl as she ate breakfast that morning , and it was dangling from her hand as she peeked into the flower garden later . In fact , she 'd hardly been seen without it for the past few weeks . Jeffrey carefully pried it from her sleeping fingers at night , and he always tucked in one of his business cards to save her place , which never seemed to change . Chapter 14 , Alice Vavasor Becomes Troubled . Lissy relied on the chapter headings-she 'd read all of those right away . They gave the novel a somewhat predictable shape , something she would n't have minded having in her own life . Jeffrey Makes a Killing on Wall Street . Lissy Sparkles in Book Discussion Group . Wherein the Myth of the Evil Stepmother Is Dispelled . Jeffrey had made more than a few killings on Wall Street , most of them back in the crazy early nineties-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a teenager ! And then , like everybody , he 'd lost a bundle in the downswing . He was still wealthy , though , by most standards , when he and Lissy met and married two years before . There was more than enough for a showy courtship and wedding ; this house they 'd christened Summerspell ; his sailboat , the Argo ; those outrageous alimony and child support payments ; and the extravagant Manhattan life he and his new bride pursued . But he fretted about the past and about the future . She would often discover him in the middle of the night , a prisoner of his own bad dreams in striped pajamas , his worried pale face eerily illuminated by the glow of his computer screen as he tracked the global markets . Jeffrey was haunted by nonfinancial concerns , too , especially his absentee fatherhood and his survival of the World Trade Center disaster , when so many of his colleagues had perished . To complicate matters even further , he believed that his life had been saved by his then four-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended that fateful morning , instead of going to work on the ninety-sixth floor of the first tower to be hit . And then there were the letters from Danielle , his ex-wife , so full of vitriol they seemed to burn his fingers when he opened them . Lissy sometimes read them in the privacy of her bathroom later , and felt just as stung by their tone and content . How could she accuse him of abandoning her and the children when he was so generous , and still seemed to have one foot firmly in their lives ? Danielle and Jeffrey had already been estranged when Lissy met him , but Danielle referred to her as " that woman " or " your stupid , blond slut " in her letters as if Lissy were some kind of home-wrecking whore and not his legal , loving wife . And she was n't stupid , even if she felt that way sometimes . Worst of all , Danielle always addressed him as Jeffie , a nickname from his past that looked disturbingly like an endearment on the page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lissy would cluck at him and urge him back to bed , where she 'd assume his insomnia and a condensed version of some of his fears-the less personal ones-while he snored peacefully beside her . What if they became poor , or at least not as rich anymore ? That was where the chapter headings might have come in handy . Would she have stuck things out ? Did she love Jeffrey for himself ? Who was he , exactly ? How hard it was to separate and sort out the many facets of identity and affection and commitment . And then he made his comeback , a spectacular and unique killing on some combination of investments and strategies-something to do with offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico-that made him the envy of the financial community and the uneasy focus of the SEC for a while . His business card , placed so inconspicuously in her Trollope that it seemed to be a part of the text , soothed her with its tone of authority : jeffrey j. snyder , esq . president and cfo world trade consultants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictional , she did n't know precisely what her husband did for a living . Left to her own choice of reading material , Lissy would have purchased a pile of easy , glossy beach books gleaned from the bestseller lists and thumbed her way through the thick , perfumed summer issues of Vanity Fair and Hamptons . Her membership in the Page Turners forced her into an attitude of self-improvement , although she had yet to sparkle or even overcome her shyness at the meetings any more than she ever had in the classroom . If she 'd been able to finish Can You Forgive Her ? or any of the shorter assigned novels in time for the appointed discussions , she might have fared better . Unfortunately , she had never moved up to the Whiz Kids , the highest-level reading group at Betsy Ross , and her difficulty with the printed word served as a soporific-more efficiently now than even sex or Ambien-as it had most of her life . She would begin to doze off soon after she began reading , her eyes losing focus first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy , even when she was curious about the story 's outcome . In college her roommate , a scholarship grind named Cynthia Ann Pope , had shared voluminous class notes with Lissy and even wrote some of her papers in exchange for clothing and cash . These days , without Cynthia Ann 's assistance , Lissy browsed through or just read part of the way into most books , and then hastily checked out plot summaries and criticism on the Internet . She 'd Googled her research for Can You Forgive Her ? even before she 'd begun reading the first page . So she knew , if the title had n't been a big enough hint , that a moral decision was begged of the reader by Trollope , and that most academics , just like Trollope 's heroine , had voted in favor of decency and true love . She could probably safely take that stance herself during the discussion . But right now she had to focus on the refreshments required of her as the Page Turners ' hostess , the one job at which she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Cutty 's daughter , what was her name again ? - skulked at the sink . The girl needed to tweeze her eyebrows and do something about her posture . Lissy said , " Hi ! " and smiled at her with forced friendliness . Without waiting for the usual scowling response , she opened the refrigerator to check on the pile of creamy little sandwiches under their sheltering dome , and the pitcher of mango mint iced tea working up an appealing cold sweat on the shelf just above . Then she went to the powder room , where the rose petals of soap she 'd brought from Paris , when the beach house was still only a postcoital tease , lay nestled in a Lucite shell . She patted the impeccable , monogrammed linen guest towels and gazed critically at herself in the mirror . But instead of touching up her lipstick or adjusting an errant strand of hair , she found herself looking into her own eyes and wondering if she would have forgiven Alice Vavasor for whatever it was she 'd done . Well , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wait and see what the others said . But then she was ambushed by another stray thought-would she ever do anything that would require the forgiveness of strangers ? - and felt a shivery thrill of prescience.
