Wicked Musical Tie-in Edition The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West Chapter One Munchkinlanders The Root of Evil From the crumpled bed the wife said , " I think today 's the day . Look how low I 've gone . " " Today ? That would be like you , perverse and inconvenient , " said her husband , teasing her , standing at the doorway and looking outward , over the lake , the fields , the forested slopes beyond . He could just make out the chimneys of Rush Margins , breakfast fires smoking . " The worst possible moment for my ministry . Naturally . " The wife yawned . " There 's not a lot of choice involved . From what I hear . Your body gets this big and it takes over -- if you ca n't accommodate it , sweetheart , you just get out of its way . It 's on a track of its own and nothing stops it now .

" Think of it as a spiritual exercise . Custody of the senses . Bodily as well as ethical continence . " " Self-control ? " She laughed , inching toward the edge of the bed . " I have no self left . I 'm only a host for the parasite . Where 's my self , anyway ? Where 'd I leave that tired old thing ? " " Think of me . " His tone had changed ; he meant this . " Frex " she headed him off --  " when the volcano 's ready there 's no priest in the world can pray it quiet . " " What will my fellow ministers think ? " " They 'll get together and say , ' Brother Frexspar , did you allow your wife to deliver your first child when you had a community problem to solve ? How inconsiderate of you ; it shows a lack of authority . You 're fired from the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no one to fire him . The nearest bishop was too distant to pay attention to the particulars of a unionist cleric in the hinterland . " It 's just such terrible timing . " " I do think you bear half the blame for the timing , " she said . " I mean , after all , Frex . " " That 's how the thinking goes , but I wonder , " " You wonder ? " She laughed , her head going far back . The line from her ear to the hollow below her throat reminded Frex of an elegant silver ladle . Even in morning disarray , with a belly like a scow , she was majestically good-looking . Her hair had the bright lacquered look of wet fallen oak leaves in sunlight . He blamed her for being born to privilege and admired her efforts to overcome it -- and all the while he loved her , too . " You mean you wonder if you 're the father " she grabbed the bedstead ; Frex took hold of her other arm and hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in general ? " She stood , mammoth , an ambulatory island . Moving out the door at a slug 's pace , she laughed at such an idea . He could hear her laughing from the outhouse even as he began to dress for the day 's battle . Frex combed his beard and oiled his scalp . He fastened a clasp of bone and rawhide at the nape of his neck , to keep the hair out of his face , because his expressions today had to be readable from a distance : There could be no fuzziness to his meaning . He applied some coal dust to darken his eyebrows , a smear of red wax on his flat cheeks . He shaded his lips , A handsome priest attracted more penitents than a homely one . In the kitchen yard Melena floated gently , not with the normal gravity of pregnancy but as if inflated , a huge balloon trailing its strings through the dirt . She carried a skillet in one hand and a few eggs and the whiskery tips of autumn chives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short phrases . Frex was n't meant to hear her . His sober gown buttoned tight to the collar , his sandals strapped on over leggings , Frex took from its hiding place -- beneath a chest of drawers -- the report sent to him from his fellow minister over in the village of Three Dead Trees . He hid the brown pages within his sash . He had been keeping them from his wife , afraid that she would want to come along -- to see the fun , if it was amusing , or to suffer the thrill of it if it was terrifying . As Frex breathed deeply , readying his lungs for a day of oratory , Melena dangled a wooden spoon in the skillet and stirred the eggs . The tinkle of cowbells sounded across the lake . She did not listen ; or she listened but to something else , to something inside her . It was sound without melody -- like dream music , remembered for its effect but not for its harmonic distresses and recoveries . She imagined it was the child inside her , humming for happiness . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , beginning to extemporize , warming up , calling forth the rolling phrases of his argument , convincing himself again of his righteousness . How did that proverb go , the one that Nanny singsonged to her , years ago , in the nursery ? Born in the morning , Woe without warning ; Afternoon child Woeful and wild ; Born in the evening , Woe ends in grieving . Night baby borning Same as the morning . But she remembered this as a joke , fondly . Woe is the natural end of life , yet we go on having babies . No , said Nanny , an echo in Melena 's mind ( and editorializing as usual ) : No , no , you pretty little pampered hussy . We do n't go on having babies , that 's quite apparent . We only have babies when we 're young enough not to know how grim life turns out . Once we really get the full measure of it -- we 're slow learners , we women -- we dry up in disgust and sensibly halt production . But men do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death . Ah , we 're slow learners , Nanny countered . But they ca n't learn at all . " Breakfast , " said Melena , spooning eggs onto a wooden plate . Her son would not be as dull as most men . She would raise him up to defy the onward progress of woe . " It is a time of crisis for our society , " recited Frex . For a man who condemned worldly pleasures he ate with elegance . She loved to watch the arabesque of fingers and two forks . She suspected that beneath his righteous asceticism he possessed a hidden longing for the easy life . " Every day is a great crisis for our society . " She was being flip , answering him in the terms men use . Dear thick thing , he did n't hear the irony in her voice . " We stand at a crossroads . Idolatry looms . Traditional values in jeopardy . Truth under siege and virtue abandoned . " Wicked Musical Tie-in Edition           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
