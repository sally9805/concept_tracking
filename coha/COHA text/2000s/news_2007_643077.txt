<p> SAVING money can be expensive . <p> Indeed , the quest to save dollars in the nation 's $2.1 trillion annual health care bill is becoming a lucrative market of its own . Thousands of companies , large and small , are pitching cost-saving ideas that range from electronic patient records to new medical devices . <p> It 's not all marketing hype . Experts in health policy agree that there is a real opportunity to curb health spending , which last year was the equivalent of $7,000 for every man , woman and child in the country . Studies predict a gain of as much as 30 percent in efficiency , mostly through reducing unnecessary tests and prescriptions , paperwork and medical mistakes . <p> Such streamlining would not cut the nation 's total medical spending , as long as there is a growing aging population with ever-increasing health needs . But certain measures are expected to help keep costs from spiraling . <p> Every cost-saving product or service requires an upfront investment , which bets that it will produce overall savings . And so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved , but it is not going to be cheap , " said David M. Cutler , a health economist at Harvard University . <p> The path to saving can be particularly uncertain in the United States ' fragmented health care economy  --  a mix of risk , regulation and profit in which the incentives are often contradictory . A physician , for example , may try new approaches to trim the costs of providing care , but the results usually benefit insurers more than doctors . Strides in efficiency may be good for society , though there may be scant financial motivation for the doctors themselves . <p> The experience of Dr. Richard Baron , who practices with three other physicians in an office in Philadelphia , provides a glimpse into the predicament . In 2004 , Dr. Baron and his colleagues made the transition from ink and paper to computers and electronic health records . They were doing what health care reformers had been advocating for years . But the arithmetic of investing in health-information technology is daunting , especially for small practices like Dr. Baron 's . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , servers , software and installation . <p> The office 's annual technology costs , he said , were about $50,000 , including maintenance and technical support , and he plans to upgrade the three-year-old computers at a cost of $54,000 . Those costs do not include the lost productivity in the first year , when the staff was learning to use the new technology . <p> Dr. Baron 's office has saved money  --  in transcribing medical reports , for example  --  and his practice now handles its 6,000 patients with three fewer office employees . He described other benefits , mainly the ability to find information quickly for patients , hospitals , insurers and labs with a few keystrokes . <p> The technology , Dr. Baron said , has also helped make him become a more adept physician . But it has not yet paid off in dollars and cents : the savings in salaries is less than the costs entailed in computerization . " It is a high-risk venture , " he said , " and you do it at your own financial peril . " <p> Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , but only 5 percent of them are in offices with five doctors or fewer  --  where about half of all doctors practice . <p> Dr. Anne Wilson has her own internal-medicine practice in Rockville , Md. , and has felt the pinch of reimbursement cutbacks from Medicare and other insurers . Buying computers and software for electronic health records , Dr. Wilson said , would mean a big cost with no clear payoff . <p> " I ca n't capture the economics of scale as a sole practitioner , " she said . " Electronic health records may well be a good thing , as a collective good , but why should I make the investment if I do n't get any of the gains ? " <p> Physicians get only about 11 percent of the savings from electronic health records ; the real benefit goes mainly to private and public insurers because , for one , they are paying for fewer unnecessary tests , and automated record-handling is a big cost saving for the payers , according to a study by the Center for Technology Leadership , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , and others reap most of the benefit , " said Dr. David J. Brailer , who was the national health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration from 2004 to 2006 . " The incentives are totally awry . " <p> In recent years , another well-promoted effort to try to cut costs while improving care has been the use of specialty cardiac hospitals . Specialty hospitals , in theory , should be able to achieve quality and efficiency by focusing on a single part of the body . Yet a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in March found that in regions where cardiac hospitals had opened , the overall rates of angioplasty and open-heart surgery more than doubled after four years , compared with regions without specialty hospitals . <p> This is another example of the paradox , with the lure of saving money undermined by marketplace realities . In the nation 's fee-for-service system of medical payments , the more procedures that are done , the more money a specialist or a hospital receives . <p> New technology also tends to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by angioplasty and stents , meshlike tubes often put in heart arteries to keep them open after blockages have been cleared . Stenting , which became common in the late 1990s , costs less , is not as invasive as open-heart surgery and involves shorter recovery times . So the number of open-heart , coronary-bypass surgeries each year has dropped by more than 100,000 since the mid-1990s , but more than a million stent procedures are now performed each year . <p> " The trigger for intervention is lower and the pool of treatable patients is larger , " said Dr. John D. Birkmeyer , director of surgical outcomes research at the University of Michigan and a co-author of the journal article . " These are institutions with an incentive to increase the supply of surgically treatable disease . It 's a matter of if you build it , they will come . " <p> Questions in the last year about the long-term safety and effectiveness of stents are causing some patients to think twice about them . Nevertheless , the stent-first approach to heart disease in the last decade has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often older and less healthy than the typical open-heart patient years ago . One consequence is that the rate of postsurgery kidney failure has increased sharply , a costly and life-threatening complication . <p> Once again , entrepreneurs are ready . The answer to the kidney problem , say engineers at Design Medical , a start-up company in Pelham , N.H. , is a new pump for the heart-lung machines used during surgery . With the better blood flow resulting from the new pump , aging kidneys and other organs will come through open-heart surgery in better shape , potentially saving up to $2 billion in hospitalization and treatment costs , said Doug Vincent , president of Design Medical . <p> The catch is that the new pump will cost $2,000 , about 10 times more than conventional pumps . " Yes , it would be more expensive , " Mr. Vincent said . " But if we 're right it would save a lot of money . " <p> The best way to improve health care and contain costs is to take a new approach , said Dr. Dean Ornish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , San Francisco , and a leading proponent of preventive medicine . Medicine is currently practiced , he said , as part of a " disease care system " geared to reactingto the consequences of bad health instead of treating the underlying causes . More than 90 percent of heart disease , Dr. Ornish insists , is preventable . <p> Over the years , Dr. Ornish has led several projects showing that fundamental changes in diet , exercise and stress management can stop and even reverse heart disease . <p> Preventive programs cost money upfront , but can cut overall treatment costs to insurers by 30 percent or more , yet few insurers pay for preventive care . <p> A third of people with health coverage switch insurers every year , so insurers reason that their investment in preventive health measures could become another company 's gain . <p> That attitude may be changing , though . Last year , Medicare agreed to cover a dietary program designed by Dr. Ornish . <p> " Given the failures of high-tech medicine , these low-tech approaches are starting to get the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-tech remains in favor , despite recent studies raising doubts about the value to many patients of widely used medical devices like heart defibrillators . The lucrative medical-device market in the United States is a favorite of venture capitalists these days . <p> " The medical technology race is a promise that we will continue to try to do everything we can , " said David Cassak , an editor at In Vivo , which covers the medical-device industry . <p> That may be a noble goal . But it is hardly a prescription for controlling costs . Health care reformers say that treatments are justified when there is evidence of sound science and financial logic . That threshold , it seems , is not the standard today . Studies done by researchers at Dartmouth College show large differences in treatment , and costs , for elderly patients in their last few years of life in different parts of the country . And , they found , more aggressive and expensive treatment does not prolong life  --  and may even shorten it . <p> " You need to move toward well-defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health care system , " said Jonathan S. Skinner , an economist at Dartmouth . " But that 's not going to be easy , and it 's going to be fraught with difficult choices . " <p> #
