When you 're following one of the biggest cats in the Western Hemisphere , be aware that one might also be following you . <p> On a fresh May morning sixteen years ago , I was walking with ten of my students along a beach in Costa Rica 's Corcovado National Park , when we came across the tracks of a sea turtle , leading out of the water and into the thick jungle beyond . A female turtle , we assumed , had come ashore to lay her eggs the night before . But no tracks led back to the water ; instead , a set of jaguar paw prints crisscrossed the turtle 's flippered swipes in the sand . Sure enough , we found the turtle in the woods , partly eaten . It was a seventy-five-pound olive ridley , which the jaguar had dragged about 300 feet into the forest . After taking a few pictures to document our find , we returned to the beach . Minutes later we spotted two animals about a mile away , loping in our direction . We promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched in awe as a female jaguar and her cub approached , then passed within twenty feet of us . <p> That lucky sighting was my first encounter with a jaguar in the wild . I was n't looking to spot one , let alone study the big cats . In fact , few people were studying them in the early 1990s , because they are so hard to find and follow . Jaguar field biologists often go several months without catching a glimpse of one . Yet no radio collars , no traps , no rigged cameras had been necessary for my first sighting , which profoundly marked me , both as a professional biologist and as a human being . I wanted to know more about their ecology , to study the factors that have made them endangered , and to track them in their natural setting . <p> It would be three years before I saw my next wild jaguar . By then , my colleague Joel C. Saenz , now at the National University of Costa Rica in Heredia , and I had resorted to pooling our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey , the white-lipped peccary ( Tayassu pecari ) in Corcovado , which has one of the highest concentrations of jaguars in Central America . <p> Jaguars populate a snaking strip of land from southern Arizona and New Mexico southward to northern Argentina . Hunting pressures on both jaguars and their primary prey , plus deforestation , have caused the species , Panthera onca , to disappear from several areas within that stretch , including the whole of El Salvador and historically extensive ranges north of the Mexican border . In fact , sightings that mark the northern limit of the jaguar 's range are recent ; after decades of absence from the United States , the occasional jaguar was sighted in Arizona and New Mexico , beginning in 1996 . In spite of its comeback , the jaguar is still considered in great danger of extinction . Needless to say , tracking the stealthy , solitary animals remains exceedingly difficult . <p> Our initial objective was to gather information about the peccaries ' and jaguars ' movement patterns . Was Corcovado large enough to maintain long-term populations of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined that jaguars feed mainly on peccaries and marine turtles . The finding was surprising , because it is clear that a jaguar could eat any animal that crosses its path , including a human being . ( There are no records , however , that jaguars have ever attacked people in the wild . ) On reflection , though , opting for peccaries and sea turtles makes sense for the jaguars : adults of both kinds of prey are easy targets and weigh between eighty and ninety pounds , so they provide a good deal of energy in one fell swoop see photographs at bottom left of next page . <p> We also realized that jaguars are active hunters by day as much as by night . Although they are skillful tree climbers and excellent swimmers , they travel mainly on the ground , walking along man-made trails . According to our findings , male jaguars require at least ten square miles of territory to support their energy needs ; females require about four square miles . The ranges of individuals , however , can overlap . <p> Those early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( WCS ) , the National Geographic Society , and Idea Wild . Soon we were tracking more jaguars and more of their prey . On one memorable occasion Saenz and I had followed a group of peccaries across the jungle and shot a big one with a dart , hoping to collar it . But because the tranquilizer needs about ten minutes to take effect , we had to pursue the peccaries . Off we ran , jumping through the forest , across a dry , sandy streambed , through more forest , and across another streambed  --  where we saw our footprints in the sand . We were going in circles ! But on top of our footprints were a set of paw prints from a big jaguar that had also been following the peccaries  --  or perhaps following us . Somehow it seemed as if the jaguars of Corcovado remained one step ahead of us . Or is that behind ? <p> Jaguar pelts , along with those of ocelots , are stacked high in a Brazilian poacher 's store . In spite of international efforts to ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them continues , and some of the cat 's populations are still in decline . <p> Individual jaguars ' coats vary in color on their backs from stunning golden-yellow to sandy brown , dotted with black , rounded rosettes . The jaguar 's belly is white with solid black spots . The top coats of the jaguars enabled us to differentiate them , and like many field investigators , we gave our subjects names . Monster was the largest cat we saw in Corcovado , weighing in at about 220 pounds , Rosa had a spot in the shape of a rose on the left side of her body , and she searched for sea turtles on the beach at every new Moon . Negra was the curious one , eager to investigate and rub against the camera " traps " that we began setting up near the beach in 2003 . <p> The camera traps have become essential to our research in Corcovado and Guanacaste national parks see map on opposite page . We place automatic cameras at sites we think are attractive to the jaguars . Each site has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggers them . What we want , of course , is to capture enough of the animal on film to identify it by its coat pattern , but what we often get is a picture of its tracks or a stray tail . In any event , one of our most effective tricks for attracting jaguars to our camera stations turns out to be . men 's cologne . <p> The idea came from a chat I had some years ago with a WCS colleague . Men 's perfume had been useful , he told me , in attracting wild cats to scent stations elsewhere . With a little experimentation in Corcovado , we found out that jaguars can not resist the smell of Calvin Klein cologne , specifically " Obsession . " They seek out the fragrance from miles away  --  perhaps because of the civet scent in it . Regardless , the stuff works , and so all our stations are baited with the perfume . The photographs enable us to identify individuals by their unique pattern of spots , as well as to make general estimates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Three favorite prey of the jaguar are pictured above . The white-lipped peccary ( left ) and sea turtle hatchlings ( middle , with a jaguar print ) , as well as adult sea turtles , are the most hunted prey in Corcovado National Park . The squirrel monkey ( right ) often evades its feline nemesis , thanks in part to the vocal warnings of its fellow monkeys . <p> If you 're lucky enough to see a wild jaguar in person , the observation is far more thrilling , and can be more informative , than a photograph . Once I went out to look for Jill ( a female jaguar named in honor of my first field assistant ) , not long after putting a radio collar on her . I wanted to make sure her radio transmitter was working properly , and to check on her general well-being . <p> After about an hour of walking through the jungle with nay radio antennas , I located Jill resting among the buttresses of a tree . She was only eighty feet or so from where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground and try to slither toward her on the forest floor . I was making good progress on nay stomach when a group of squirrel monkeys started calling from the trees above me . I recognized the particular call they were making  --  something like that of a barking dog  --  as their danger signal . <p> I looked up at them , but they were n't looking at me . I thought , " Hmmm , they usually make that sound when they see either a snake . or a feline . " With that thought , I turned to nay right and froze on the spot : just fifteen feet away was a male jaguar . Again a jaguar had been following my movements without my knowledge . Once this jaguar knew I had noticed him , he simply turned and walked casually into the thick woods . I was left puzzling over his behavior , but not fearful . Especially after that incident , fear was not a factor for me ; the animals simply are not aggressive toward people . <p> In many ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal can save itself the trauma of wounds from hunting prey , competing for potential mates , or fighting territorial battles . A wound in the jungle , after all , can mean a hasty death , since parasites abound . <p> Only in two-week-long mating encounters , and in the rearing of the young  --  a process that takes about eighteen months  --  do jaguars interact with one another . Most mothers bear two cubs , though litters of one cub or as many as four are not uncommon . In some cases a litter can include one spotted and one black cub ; people once distinguished the black jaguars as " panthers . " ( The term is a general one , however , and it has also been applied to leopards and cougars with entirely black coats . ) <p> Evolution has placed jaguars at the top of the food chain , but left them with one possible weakness : poor sprinting skills . Unlike the other big cats in the genus Panthera  --  including leopards , lions , and tigers  --  jaguars do n't run much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then pounce . Making incredibly silent approaches , the cats simply lunge from the shadows of the jungle and swiftly bite their prey in the neck . Why run when there 's nothing worth running from and nobody knows you 're coming ? <p> In spite of their lack of aggression , jaguars are coming in closer contact with people as we encroach on their habitats . In Costa Rica , farmers have recently shot jaguars when the cats strayed from within national parks and raided pig farms or cattle ranches . Yet the jaguars have good reason for fanning out to seek alternative food sources . Three of their favorite prey species , the white-lipped peccary , the collared peccary , and the paca ( a large rodent related to the common agouti ) , are all falling victim to massive hunting for their succulent meat . <p> Many national parks of Costa Rica ( dark green ) offer some protection for the country 's threatened jaguars . The author has conducted extensive field studies in Corcovado National Park , in the southwest corner of the country . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protected areas , or even inside the park boundaries if rangers are n't vigilant , since that 's where more animals reside . In Corcovado , for instance , the peccary population has fallen by some 60 percent since 2000 because of hunting pressure . The hunters use high-caliber automatic rifles , such as AK-47s , which can kill as many as fifty animals in a few minutes . During the same six years , jaguar numbers in Corcovado dropped from about 150 animals to a mere thirty or forty . <p> When jaguars lose their food supply and face starvation , they naturally seek other means of survival . Farms become targets . And once they kill a domestic cow or pig , they learn that farm animals are easy prey . So hungry jaguars , in turn , become the targets of farmers ' wrath . Fortunately , funding in 2005 from the Moore Foundation supported the hiring of fifty-three new park rangers for conservation areas on the Osa Peninsula . Our studies show that the peccary population has recuperated since then . But it will take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery in Corcovado . <p> Efforts to stop deforestation in some areas and to support ecological restoration in parks such as Guanacaste are also helping support the jaguar populations . Still , three Costa Rican national parks , Tortuguero , La Amistad , and Braulio Carrillo , are suffering serious losses of their jaguars . <p> Another threat to the cats ' safety comes from the fur trade , which underwent frenzied growth in the 1960s . In Brazil alone , 15,000 jaguars were being killed every year . The year 1973 marked a change in the trade of jaguar pelts : the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) helped to cut down on the traffic in jaguar pelts . Yet in countries such as Nicaragua , a black market for pelts still exists see photograph at top of page 32 . There you can buy a full pelt for about $200 , not to mention other products such as belts , shoes , and wallets . <p> Costa Rica depends ever more heavily on tourism and wildlife conservation for its income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's living resources . Nevertheless , a single country can not make much headway without the support of its neighbors . Alan Rabinowitz , a WCS biologist who has worked avidly to protect jaguars in Belize , has proposed establishing a multinational " Jaguar Corridor , " which would run from the southwestern U.S. through to northern Argentina . Ideally , the corridor would include enough protected areas in every country along the way to sustain a healthy , contiguous jaguar population . Barriers , both physical and political , continue to prevent that kind of linkage . One case in point is the proposed " border fence " between the U.S. and Mexico . <p> Adult jaguars are excellent tree climbers , often using trees as resting spots , scratching posts , or caches for their prey . The author once found a marine turtle stashed ten feet above the ground in Costa Rica 's Guanacaste National Park . <p> Whether or not a Jaguar Corridor is established , new research must focus on mapping and understanding the distribution of jaguars across the countries that make up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making progress in determining how the parks ' managers can best protect jaguars and their prey . We must continue that work  --  much about the jaguars has yet to be discovered  --  but , more urgently , we need to extend our existing collaborations to other research teams . The goal must be to ensure that populations of jaguars do not continue to disappear from any of our countries . Education and bans on hunting the jaguars ' prey inside protected areas will help . <p> Human beings have to remember that we , too , belong to nature . What we do to nature , we do to ourselves . The linkages of cause and effect are circular , just as my chase of the peccaries was . Like the jaguar in the forest , what is lurking in our shaded future may be unrecognized and unknown , but it may also be ready to cover our heavy tracks with new and unexpected ones of an entirely different cast . <p> To find Web links related to this article , visit **25;1697;TOOLONG and click " Online Extras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 2007 .
