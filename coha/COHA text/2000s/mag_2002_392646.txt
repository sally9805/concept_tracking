Practical ? No , but these cars deliver the most fun on the road for the money . // oFF THE TOP of my head , I do n't know who makes my toaster . Making toast is n't very involved , and my toaster demands little of me . So long as I pay my electric bill , it 's happy . I do n't think about my toaster , and I certainly do n't relish the opportunity to depress a plastic lever and let the laws of thermodynamics work their magic . A lot of cars today are like toasters . They are appliances . They are simple , unobtrusive pieces of technology that require little from their owners-just put the thing in D , step on the gas and you 're on your way . And , like toasters , these cars are safe , reliable and reasonably efficient-which is great , except that , like toasters , they 're also kind of boring . In many cases , it seems that automakers have engineered the soul out of cars to score points with J.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you think your car is electric ; suspensions are designed so much for comfort 's sake that you can barely feel the road . This is n't so great if you like cars . I like cars . I like the way they sound . I like the way they corner . I like the way they accelerate . More important , I like it when my car lets me know it 's doing those things . There are fabulous vehicles out there that do a miraculous job of insulating you in cocoonlike luxury , and while I salute their engineering achievements , they 're not for me . I like the mechanical-ness of a car , and I want to be a part of it . Do you too fidget in your responsible sedan or versatile SUV , wishing for something a little more fun ? Fortunately , some car makers still understand that there 's more to driving than just going from point A to point B. They assemble their engineers and tell them to build the car they 'd like to drive themselves . These engineers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're now blessed with more cars that put driving first than at any time in recent memory . Are such cars practical ? Usually not . Cup holders , foldable rear seats and storage compartments are not what these cars are all about . These cars do n't trumpet their luxurious appointments or tout their Swiss-Army-knife usefulness . These cars are fim . I 'm not getting into some ridiculous " you are what you drive " discussion because , after all , cars are nothing but metal , plastic and glass-but you are what you drive . These cars say that you want to stand out at least a bit ; that you care more about performance than status ; that you replace your brake pads more frequently because you use them more often . Cars with these qualities are nothing new . For years you could tear up the road in a fun car-unless the car broke or it was so difficult to drive that you wound up seeing more ditches and fences than checkered flags . What 's new are cars that are as reliable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your face without requiring Indy  --  worthy driving skills . The same engineering prowess that makes some cars boring also makes fun cars exponentially better than in the past . Now you can buy an auto with a throttle that 's responsive , steering that 's dead-on accurate and ( perhaps most important ) a suspension tuned more for cornering and stability than plush luxury-and you can do your best Aj . Foyt impression without worrying about how much the next realignment 's going to cost . Five of the most fun cars on the road are , in my opinion , machines that have come out in the past year or so . For what you 'll pay for any of them , you 'll get more smiles than you would from any similarly priced model . Of course , since these cars are all limited or special editions of existing models , that price point is pretty much nonnegotiable-all go for full list price if not more . ( The list prices below include popular options and destination fees , but not taxes . ) Some are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well-made and reliable . See which fits you best . Mini Cooper List price : $18,200 Mini Cooper hysteria is such that people are willing to wait months and pay full bust-out retail for the privilege of owning one . It 's entirely justified . The new Mini is one of the first great cars of the 21st century . Even without its stylish design , the Mini will win you over with its eager four-cylinder engine that begs you to drive it faster . The whole package is a bit more refined than the boy-racer Ford SVT Focus-the other sub-$20,000 new fun car I like-but that does n't mean the Mini 's any less capable . The suspension , a corporate cousin of what goes into BMW 's sedans , is taut and does its best to keep the Mini composed , but not so much that you ca n't have a little fun with it . I 've never been in a car that was so go-cart-likethe suspension and the light steering kept the Mini pointed wherever I wanted it-yet so solid . The whimsical interior , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is gravy : with that drivetrain and suspension , I would have taken the Mini with a plywood dash and seats made out of oily rags . BMW M3 convertible List price : $55,920 I 'm an okay driver , I 'm not a great driver . I 'm probably the worst kind of driver , because I 'm just good enough to get myself into trouble . This made me a bit nervous about driving the M3 because it is one of the greats , a sports sedan so dominant in international competition that it was ultimately banned . Of all the models in this article , the M3 is the most serious performance car-in the right hands , it can give a Porsche 911 a run for the money That BMW and I are still on good terms is testament to the M3 's surprisingly forgiving nature . The 333  --  hp engine has more power than most anyone ever needs , and that power is only an ankle flex away at any given time . The multilink suspension keeps you in a straight line , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast and slow down in mid-turn . The SMG ( sequential manual gearbox ) dispenses with a clutch and instead makes you change gears , Formula I-style , by flipping a set of paddles mounted behind the steering wheel . Even better , you can switch the transmission to automatic when you 're slogging through downtown traffic . Fantastic . By the time I gave the M3 back , I 'd remembered that I 'm often initially intimidated by people who turn out to be my closest friends . Jaguar S-type R List price : $62,400 When I was a kid , my dad had an Oldsmobile Cutlass . It was an ordinary enough car , except that he managed to buy the " special police package , " which meant that the standard engine and shocks had been swapped for more heavy-duty equipment ( this included a big-block V-8 that put out something like 400 hp ) . To the naked eye , however , my dad 's car looked like every other regular American sedan . Today my dad would probably want to buy a Jaguar S-type R. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the R badge indicates that everything ( namely , the engine , now rated at 400 hp ) has been upgraded for some serious law-breaking speed . Of course , this being a Jaguar , such performance never comes at the expense of comfort or civility . It 's a different interpretation of performance : All the other cars in this piece lay their cards on the table when it comes to what you can expect from them , but the Jag likes to play it close to the vest . You know those little races on the interstate that crop up between you and another driver ? You can win those in the S-type R. Moreover , they 'll never see you coming . You can even do this with three other people in your car . And they could all be asleep . Mercedes-Benz SL 500 List price : $89,385 Some of the most fun I had in this car was when it was n't even moving . The new SL features a crowd-pleasing , folding steel roof that can be activated remotely from the key . Trust me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which inevitably has drawn a few onlookers , and startling them when the roof begins to do origami and disappear into the trunk . And unlike previous SL models-some of which were driven more by valet parking attendants than by their owners-this latest number is a hoot to drive . This SL can be described only in superlatives . Nothing comes close to its engineering , quality and technology ( and at these prices , nothing should ) . The suspension constantly adjusts to provide optimum handling and comfort ; the brakes are electronically actuated ( as opposed to the oldfashioned mechanical linkages ) to improve control and shorten stopping distances ; the transmission learns your driving style ( lead foot or grandma ) and adapts accordingly . And even at high speeds with the top down , the cabin is serene enough to prune a bonsai tree . You do n't normally think of a roadster as a daily driver-but after some time behind the SUs wheel , you would n't want anything else . Ford SVT Focus List price : $19,490 The SL may represent the ultimate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $90,000 to have a great time behind the wheel if you 're willing to forgo some performance . This Focus proves that . I liked the original Focus hatchback when it came out in 1999 . It did n't look like so many other three-doors , with its sharp , angular lines and bizarrely placed tail lamps , and it had one of the best chassis around : superstiff and ready to handle whatever you could throw at it . Unfortunately , the original Focus ' engine was n't really up to the task , so let me thank Ford 's in-house tuner division , the special vehicle team ( SVT ) , for turning the Focus into the car it always should have been . The SVT Focus is a genuine hot hatch : You can drive it as if you were in the Monte Carlo Rally , and it will plant itself on the tarmac as if it were made out of Elmer 's . Grip like this is hard to come by at three times the price . Author Affiliation Sam Grobart writes about cars for Esquire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
