Everyone needs goals and for many young aspiring musicians , the pinnacle of achievement in their youthful lives may quite possibly be attaining a seat in the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra . But dream as hard as they might , little Johnny and Jane will not be able to reach that goal without the help of good music instructors , a supportive family and a lot of practice . Perhaps that does not sound too difficult , but considering that a steady trend over the last several years has seen music programs in Toronto-area schools cut back drastically , parents of musically inclined youngsters are being forced to look outside the school system for alternatives to supplement their children 's musical education . A case in point , the Toronto District School Board announced at the beginning of June that it will begin to phase out instrumental music classes in Grades 4 through 6 over the next three years . Strings and band instructors and other resources currently available to those grades will be " redeployed " to Grades 7 and 8 music classes . Critics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a negative impact on the musical preparedness of children as they enter middle and secondary schools . These cutbacks have occurred despite an Ontario government mandate to include music in the province 's education curriculum for Grades 1 to 8 . According to the Ministry of Education , the study of music enhances kids ' intellectual and emotional development . It not only helps develop their practical artistic skills , but also enables them to sharpen their reasoning and critical thinking abilities . Yet , cutbacks at the school board level continue and have been happening over a long period of time , says Ann Cooper Gay , music and artistic director of Canadian Children 's Opera Chorus in Toronto . " I taught for 16 years in the public school system , and I have watched it just go down , down , down , to the point where there 's almost nothing ( offered ) , " she says , " although we still have our magnet schools , like Claude Watson ( School for the Arts ) and Etobicoke School of the Arts and Cardinal Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrolment in these top-end arts-oriented schools is limited each year and admission standards are rigorous . Families wanting to instill a love of music in their children have to look outside the school system to the myriad of private and group lessons offered in the city . Classes range from private music instrument lessons to band instruction to choirs for children . The Koffler School of Music in North York is one example . Private music instrument instruction is offered for piano , flute , violin , guitar and recorder . The school also has a children 's choir ( ages seven to 11 ) and a youth choir ( 12 to 18 ) . Through the Royal Conservatory of Music , the Koffler School is able to offer onsite group classes for kids aged newborn to six . Programs for young kids include preparatory music classes , eurhythmics movement classes and Kodaly singing lessons . In addition , a Suzuki school provides violin , cello and piano classes for children aged from three years old . Theory and history lessons for older kids are also offered by Koffler . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kitchen percussion is educational , but you 're using instruments that can be found in your house - from your kitchen cupboard , garage or basement , " explains Adrienne Cohen , Koffler 's director of music . Koffler 's programs run during the academic year and auditions are required for kids wanting to participate in the choirs where they 'll have the opportunity to perform throughout the community . Graph Not Transcribed These music classes help bridge the gap created by the cutbacks , says Cohen . " These programs are very popular because people want to ensure that their kids get some kind of music education . " The Greater Toronto Area provides dozens of options , such as the Toronto School of Music Canada , North Toronto Institute of Music , Toronto School for Strings and University Settlement Music and Arts School . The Royal Conservatory of Music offers private and group music instruction at both its downtown Toronto and Mississauga locations . In addition , Suzuki music programs are offered at various locations throughout the city . Music retailer Yamaha Canada also offers classes to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few years , such as the Bach Children 's Chorus and Chamber Youth Choir , Toronto Mendelssohn Youth Choir and Yip 's Children 's Choir . Perhaps the most well-known is Toronto Children 's Chorus ( TCC ) , established in 1978 to provide a children 's choir to sing with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra . Since that time , TCC has come into its own right , recording CDs and touring extensively over five continents . Also popular is the Canadian Children 's Opera Chorus ( CCOC ) . Similar to Toronto Children 's Chorus 's beginnings , the CCOC was originally founded in 1968 to fill the need for children to take part in operas performed by the Canadian Opera Company , however , the CCOC has its own board and operates separately from the COC itself . As an opera chorus , the CCOC offers kids a unique experience in choral singing Cooper Gay says . " The one thing that really separates us from a stand-up-and-sing choir is that we offer kids training in drama , so they learn , hopefully , to move with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies . " The CCOC has five chorus divisions , ranging from the Ruby Chorus for children aged five to six years to the Youth Chorus for 16 to 20 year olds . The Main Chorus , for kids aged 10 to 16 years , is considered the CCOC 's flagship choir . Children are required to audition each year for placements in the choirs , regardless of whether or not they were members in previous years . While Cooper Gay says she does n't feel the CCOC necessarily fills a gap created by public school cuts to music programs , she has seen firsthand the effects of the cutbacks . " I do auditions every year and I think , " Holy smokes , there are kids who can not sing in tune . ' It makes me so mad because what has happened is they do n't have any training in schools , " she says . " So I 've decided what we need to do is get them when they 're young , get them when they 're five years old , and put them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting it anywhere else . " The CCOC also offers a bursary program for parents concerned about heavy tuition costs . " No child is ever turned down because of money , " Cooper Gay says . " We have a really good bursary program ( for children of low-income families ) thanks to the Bank of Montreal . " In a similar vein , part of the mission of University Settlement Music and Arts School is a belief that quality music and arts programs should be available to families of all income levels . Anne Yardley , University Settlement 's music and arts school director , says her organization not only provides subsidies for lower-income families but also offers group classes that are particularly affordable . In addition , musical instruments can be rented at low cost because many kids ca n't afford to purchase an instrument outright . Currently , group classes for children are fairly limited . Some programs include music for pre-schoolers aged three to five years , creative dance for three to five year olds , and ballet , jazz and tap dance for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a children 's choir and add an ear-training and sight-singing class . The school 's subsidy fund is based on total family income and the number of family members living in the home . In addition to renting instruments for a nominal fee , University Settlement also provides its practice facilities free of charge . Scholarships for gifted students are also offered . When the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra ( TSYO ) holds its annual auditions in early September this year , it will be looking for young musicians capable of playing at a high level , says Sarah Richardson , the youth orchestra 's manager . The 15-year-old girl who was appointed TSYO concertmaster last year might have felt like it was a dream come true . But she is an exceptionally talented musician with prior experience playing in orchestras , Richardson explains . The young girl did n't achieve that success without years of practice , private lessons and a family ready to support her as she strove toward her dreams . As the CCOC 's Cooper Gay says : " Kids can do anything . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just little people , but they are just as capable of doing anything an adult can . The more you believe in a child and the more you give them that space where they can feel comfortable and secure , the higher they 're going to go .

Koffler 's director of music , Adrienne Cohen , says she finds parents are very supportive of the school and many will volunteer their time for certain activities , for example , designing a program for a student recital . The type of parental involvement can be expressed in other ways , such as being aware of children 's music practice times and offering gentle encouragement for weary eyes and fingers . Parents should be cautious about over-committing their child , though . Registering children in too many music programs at a time can lead to frustrated expectations and negatively impact overall schoolwork . And above all , parents should gauge whether or not a child 's motivation stems from a genuine interest and desire in studying and excelling at music , or simply a wish to please or appease a pressuring parent . To help children develop an interest in live musical performance , parents may want to consider taking their child to music recitals and concerts on a regular basis . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
