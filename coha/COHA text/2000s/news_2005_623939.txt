<p> Hi , I 'm Stu . Come in . Sit down and I 'll take you to bed , " says the host at Supperclub , welcoming guests who are about to embark on an unconventional dining experience . <p> Dressed in black pants and shirt , with a white sport coat and platform saddle shoes , Stu Gerry is the first person diners see after walking through the all-black entry of this warehouse-size space on Harrison Street . Only later does Stu explain that the dark walls , charred chair , sooty chandelier and black bouquet of roses pay homage to San Francisco and the 1906 earthquake and fire . <p> Diners then enter into La Salle Rouge  --  " because everything sounds better in French , " says a receptionist  --  to have a drink and wait for a table . The bar is awash in red  --  red floor , red walls and red banquettes , with dozens of disco balls spinning from the ceilings . <p> " OK , " Stu says dancing over to us and extending his hand toward the double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He opens the doors to reveal what looks like the stage set from Woody Allen 's " Sleeper . " The two-story , all-white room is lined with enough mattresses and fluffy pillows to accommodate 150 . The DJ booth is front and center , along with an exhibition kitchen flanked by open stairways that lead up to the mattress-lined mezzanine . Patrons are instructed to take off their shoes and " climb into bed . " <p> This unique restaurant and bar is a branch of a club in Amsterdam , operated locally by Alex Lustberg and Tad Glauthier . They adhere to the basic concept of the Dutch club , with a few modifications . For example , in Amsterdam people spend five or six hours eating in bed ; in San Francisco , the limit is about three , maybe four hours on weekends . <p> Just about everything in Supperclub is tongue-in-chic  --  a bit naughty and ultimately harmless . The gymnasium-size room is like a blank canvas waiting to fulfill whatever fantasies guests may have in mind , aided by the artistic and friendly servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artistic director . <p> One time the outfits were inspired by exotic animals , another time a gender-bender S &M; experience a la " The Rocky Horror Picture Show . " On my last visit , each waiter was free to wear what he or she liked . Ours was in lounging pajamas with a mandarin top and a black-and-white cap that looked like an upside-down tulip . He had wildly painted eyes that still could n't upstage his Ultra Brite smile . Another server was outfitted in a U.S. Navy dress jacket that was often open or removed to reveal his hairy chest and vinyl hot pants . With ruby-red lips and false eye lashes that looked like they were clipped from a newborn fawn , he completed the outfit with knee-high black platform boots that showed off his shapely shaved legs . <p> To explain the finer points of the evening , our waiter hopped into bed with us . The five-course menu ( $60 ) is designed to be a surprise , much like the rest of the evening . He asked if we had any dietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , leaving behind a Chinese takeout carton filled with truffled popcorn . It 's an appropriately symbolic snack , because throughout the night , diners are entertained by performance artists , singers and acrobats , who are often joined by the gregarious , energetic service staff . <p> An aerial artist may swoop down from the ceiling , an exotic dancer with dragon-like fingernails might undulate around the room with a live snake wrapped around her arm , and a waiter from the bar may don a sherbet green evening dress and roller skate to a disco beat . Between courses , a cadre of masseuses offers massages . <p> With only one seating a night , the pace is leisurely , even if the surroundings are frenetic . After allowing from 30 minutes to an hour to get settled and order the first round of drinks , the first course arrives . One night it was two intertwined prawns on a bed of shredded lettuce and a blanket of chile sauce . Other nights , Jerry McGinnis , who was the chef at Jianna in North Beach before opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been better if the grated potatoes were at least served close to room temperature ; another night he featured his own rendition of tuna salad nicoise . <p> Generally by the second course  --  always a soup served in a whiskey glass  --  diners have begun to snuggle into the extra-soft pillows and become acquainted with their fellow bedmates . The soup , like the menu , changes weekly , but recent offerings included roasted tomato , white bean puree with smoked ham , and cream of cauliflower with croutons and bright dribbles of fruity olive oil . <p> About the time the soup is served , two " cats " in black leotards slink down one of the staircases . Patrons are offered a peacock feather so they can tease the human cats and watch them roll over , bat the feather and snuggle up to patrons . <p> The performers , like the food , change often . You can imagine my surprise one night when , while eating the ahi appetizer , I turned away from my dining partner and said hello to the hairy backside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my other side talking to another customer . <p> While the mixed greens under the tuna were properly dressed in citrus vinaigrette and enhanced by a snowy flurry of egg whites , tapenade and haricot verts , the saffron aioli did n't provide quite enough interest to perk up the fish . <p> Patrons really get into the mood of things after the third course . One night it was four-cheese ravioli with chives and lemon verbena oil . Flavors were bright and the dish tasted good even though the corners of the pasta were leathery , as if they 'd sat out too long , and the filling was a bit grainy . Another night McGinnis prepared Asian-style barbecued baby back ribs , and Stu brought around disposable rubber gloves so diners would n't soil their hands . The ribs were stacked on a spicy green papaya salad with cilantro , toasted garlic and chile oil , a combination that stumbled a bit because the vinegar bit back . <p> By that time the crowd was so excited that a gaggle of women celebrating a birthday on the mezzanine formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the dining room . Eventually Stu asked everyone to climb back into bed so waiters could serve the entree . <p> The kitchen seems to add an extra dash of creativity to the main courses . On one visit , McGinnis served slices of lamb loin fanned over a hillock of spinach surrounded by Israeli couscous and deep-fried chickpeas . Another night he draped fork-tender beef tenderloin over sauteed rainbow chard and a gratin of sweet potatoes redolent of ginger . The plate was unified with a port wine demi-glace that added just enough sweetness without overpowering . On my final visit , the kitchen marinated quail in ancho chile and paired the bird with posole and marinated napa cabbage ; it had the same acidic kick as the tuna appetizer , but the drizzle of cilantro creme fraiche did n't smooth it out significantly . <p> McGinnis is often able to produce combinations brash enough to pull diners ' attention away from the surroundings , at least for a moment . However , with only a single menu ( along with a corresponding vegetarian option ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup , a puckery salad or a blood-rare quail . <p> Keeping in the outrageous spirit of the evening , the chef tries to incorporate some unexpected presentations into the mix  --  serving soup in clear glasses and popcorn in Chinese carryout containers , for examples  --  but at times he goes a little too far , such as using an ashtray for his huckleberry creme brulee . <p> On other visits , McGinnis used martini glasses for a dense chocolate mousse capped with poached pears , and to hold cubes of lemon pound cake with cranberry orange compote , chantilly cream and bits of candied orange zest . <p> As the meal winds down , the crowd revs up . The waiter brings the check and emphasizes that diners can stay as long as they want . Before long , the remaining people in the restaurant will be mingling with the hordes in the bar . <p> On weekends , people line up outside to get in , and even midweek the bar is packed . As we jostle through the crowd , hearing snippets of pick-up lines and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the door . " OK , " I say , " Let 's go to bed . " <p> Wines , beverages lack spark <p> Because Supperclub does n't charge a cover , the cost of entertainment has to come from somewhere . Alcohol seems be the logical place . While the food is reasonably priced at $60 for a five-course menu , the wine list is high , with most markups starting at triple wholesale . <p> While there are many good selections , the list lacks a well-defined point of view and is n't as interesting as the food . <p> Specialty cocktails range from $7 to $9 , which is more or less the going rate these days . Most are on the sweet side  --  Black Cherry Drop ( $9 ) with vodka , lemon and Chambord ; Wedding Cake ( $7 ) with vanilla vodka and pineapple juice ; and De Chocolade ( $9 ) , composed of vodka , chocolate liqueur and Creme de Cacao . <p> The 50-plus item wine list is divided into categories by style , such as Crisp &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There you 'll find such labels as the 2003 Flowers Chardonnay ( $68 ) and the 2004 Bonterra Lakeview Vineyard Roussane ( $36 ) . Red wines include 2004 Carneros Creek Pinot Noir ( $40 ) , the exceptional 2002 Shafer Firebreak ( $68 ) and the 2003 Joel Gott Dillian Ranch Zinfandel ( $47 ) . <p> If you bring your own wine , corkage is $20.  --  M.B. <p> CHART : <p> Supperclub 657 Harrison St. ( near Hawthorne , between Second and Third streets ) , San Francisco ; ( 415 ) 348-0900 .
