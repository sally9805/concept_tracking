When I was young our winter-wear would n't have permitted anyone to look sexy . The look then was like the inflated figures in a Macy 's parade , puffy and down-stuffed , colorful rubber boots , with pompons on the hats our mothers knitted , matching mittens hanging on yarn from our coat sleeves . Fashion then did n't have in mind sprinting along the highway on a bitter frozen day in muscle-sheathing elastic fabrics , costumed from head to foot like a superhero . The jogger on the highway shoulder outside Telluride had every straining tendon and ligament , every flex and thrust , defined in his shining black outfit . Running hard , his mouth made a white grimace under his yellow bug-like goggles . Velocity Man , on his way to save the day . <p> And on a Sunday , no less . I had braked when I saw him , hobbling my old Saab apologetically toward the center line to be sure he understood I knew he possessed the moral high road , hiding my smoldering cigarette beneath the dash as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , banking on a rumor I 'd heard that nothing you did the first ten days of pregnancy affected the fetus in the least . A grace period , some stepping-down time from your bad habits . God 's air lock . And then , amazingly , there was my brother , also on the highway shoulder , but not wearing Lycra . Not likely . He was climbing into the passenger side of his car . I pulled up behind it , assuming he 'd stopped to pee or that the car had broken down again . We were two miles from town on the only road into it . <p> " Beer ? " Sonny asked , unsurprised when I opened the driver 's door . There was a box of cans on the back seat . <p> " No , thanks . What 's going on ? " <p> " I 'm taking a break . " <p> " From what ? " <p> " Getting this heap home . " His heater blew ; the day , mid-April and barely into spring , had begun with rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it alternated between snow and hail , soft ice or harsh . On the windshield the snowflakes melted upon contact . This was the treacherous seasonal moment when it seemed that winter might never end , that summer was a sappy dream left over from a storybook . " What are you up to ? " he asked . <p> " Back from the bin . " I blushed , but my brother would n't ask where I 'd spent the night , or who with . On Saturdays I drove the hundred twenty-five miles to Grand Junction to visit my husband , then slept at another man 's house . He and I went out drinking at the Junction bars , which were different from the Telluride bars . Happier , I thought . Younger , this time of year , while the junior college was still in session , and certainly no dumber . Up in Telluride the ski runs had shut down , and the party animals had gone home . Their hosts were vaguely sour , used , and disillusioned . The slopes had turned treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How 's Larry doing ? Close that door . It 's a witch 's tit . " <p> I tossed the cigarette butt over the car and onto the bike path , then settled into the driver 's seat of the Nova . Sonny had bought it just recently to restore and its interior smelled like hound dog and its prey . " You should drink whiskey , if you 're so cold . " <p> " Do n't go there , " he said , shaking his head , finishing the beer . His gloves were wool , without fingers because he 'd snipped them off . <p> " He 's fine , " I told him , concerning Larry . " He says he meets really interesting people in the hospital . He says he 's still achieving nirvana at least once a day , when they let him have the solarium to himself . He asked me to bring him his bridge books next week so he can teach one of the other patients how to play , try to wrestle up a foursome ... " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on coming home anytime soon . He likes it there . " <p> " What 's not to like ? Nirvana every day ? " <p> " That 's what he claims . " <p> " Although I could never get bridge straight . " <p> " Me , neither . " <p> Sonny popped another top and drained half the can . Because it was diet beer , he could drink twice as much . He 'd asked me to pick up more for him , down in Junction where it was cheaper , and I 'd forgotten . I was forgetful . He said , " You wan na do me a favor ? " <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " Drive me back to my truck . " He threw a thumb over his shoulder . <p> I craned around and saw Big Red , sitting behind a few hundred yards , also on the roadside . Its roomy cab and rounded edges made it seem homey , smiling grill and side mirrors like little ears , snow on its roof like a flattop haircut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like Big Red , " I said , " but this car seems kind of cursed . " <p> " She 's been manhandled . " He patted the cracked dash . Overhead , dusty material sagged . Blond dog hair clung to everything , a few downy feathers , dank undercurrent of dead fish . A hunter had owned it before he had a heart attack out in the woods alone . At auction , Sonny had been the only bidder . Such was the advantage of being so out of step with the rest of Telluride , where the Range Rovers ruled . Today , because the Nova had needed a valve job , my brother had been driving the two vehicles home by himself , leapfrogging the five miles from his friend 's illegal garage down the canyon . <p> " Drive ahead , run on back , " he explained , running his fingers like legs . " Drive ahead , run on back . " <p> " In those boots ? Why did n't you wait and let me help you this afternoon ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't help ; she was n't finished avenging herself on him for some past bad behavior . <p> " I needed the car now . " Sonny was simple that way ; he wanted something , he went and got it , even if it meant running some portion of the distance home in freezing sleet , wearing his logger 's boots and ball cap and cut-up gloves . What portion ? I wondered . The whole five miles ? Ten , since he had to shuttle back and forth ? This was one of those story problems math teachers are always trying to persuade you will come up in your real life . " I reckon we could figure a better method , " he said , " now there 's two of us . " <p> " But now there 's three cars . " <p> " Damned if they do n't still have us outnumbered . " <p> The state trooper rushed by , heading out of town with his lights on and his siren off . <p> " Go , Smokey , go , " urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The bartender back in Grand Junction had n't been the one from the night before . I was just glad the place opened on Sunday ; I had n't realized it was also a diner . <p> " I 'm here to pick up my credit card . " <p> He was the daytime tender , too young , soft from TV and Pop-Tarts and higher education , somebody who could handle no more difficult patron than the elders , the early risers who opened the place at ten ordering hard fried eggs and red beer . A few of them leaned over the bar , still as wax figures , occupying every other stool , eyes an easy blur behind fudgy lenses . Cigarette smoke , at this hour , smelled somehow fresh rather than noxious , like a bristling campfire at dawn , complete with the odor of bacon wafting about . <p> " I do n't find a card , " the youth reported , sniffing . He had a hell of a cold , a bead of clear mucus moving in and out of his nostril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked drawn on with red ink . <p> " Well . " It was so exhausting , the missing credit card , the long chain reaction . And the place was warm , smelling of fried pork . I decided to delay the labor , the retracing of my steps . " How about a bloody mary ? " The bartender took a second to decide whether to ask for ID ; it still happened to me maybe half the time . But not for much longer . <p> He made the drink with Clamato . " Nautical , " I said , settling at an empty stool between two men . " Naughty , " I added . " Maybe the card is under the counter , with the bad checks and the lost-and-found ? There might have been an altercation ? " <p> The drunk on my right said , " That 's a good breakfast drink . It 's got food value . Beer has food value as well , " he indicated his own glass . " This Guinness , here . " We watched the creamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geologic event . " But food , you know , does not have beer value . " He , alone among the group , did n't even pretend to eat . <p> " No , " I agreed . " That is the problem . " <p> " Wherever your credit card is , it is n't here , " the bartender said , using two fingers to plug his sneeze . I 'd left the card to run a tab , then there 'd been pool balls flying on account of some college girls and their boyfriends , a town-gown kind of dispute . We 'd exited through the back door , the one with the panic handle that claimed to be only for emergencies , into the alley and down the block , laughing , floating . My friend was Jonathan ; he said he 'd seen enough bar fights to know when to leave . I was trying to fall in love with him . Escapades like this were helpful . The effort required diligence , an active imagination , an ability to overlook . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease , the advantage of gravity . He was fifteen years younger than my husband ; close to my age , in other words . Though I saw no evidence of the fracas , I knew this was the place because my car still sat in its parking lot out front , morose rusted Saab . It was remarkable what could happen one night and be utterly forgotten in the light of the morning after . This enduring establishment , named Earl 's , like the human body , withstood a drunken brawling assault and resurrected itself , day after day after day . The pool balls sat racked and ready , the cues returned to their case . The trembling hands at the bar , reaching for their drinks . <p> My brother Sonny had once told me he 'd rather die than quit drinking . I felt certain I was sitting among like minds . <p> " You know , you can cancel the card , " the bartender said wearily . I could tell he thought he was better than any of the people he served . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked . <p> " I have to figure out which card it is . " I had a lot of credit cards , each with a low limit , because I was somebody credit-card companies thought ought to be spread thin . I paged through them in my wallet while the man beside me , old enough to be my father , gave me discouraging scenarios concerning spending sprees . <p> " That fella could be all the way to Mexico by now . " <p> " By God , " the Guinness drinker on my other side affirmed . <p> " He could be putting himself up at a swanky four-star motel , getting himself whatever he beck and calls , all on your nickel . I once had somebody charge himself airline tickets on my Visa-and you know that card never even left my billfold , I had it on my person the whole time , in my ass pocket-and here it comes charging me , anyway , some somnabitch flying from Vegas to Boston . " <p> This line of conversation tapped into the computer nerd in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fears concerning fraud . One phone call , he kept saying pedantically , wiping his runny nose . Easy as pie . I made the call after spreading the contents of my wallet on the bar and narrowing the options . There 'd been no " activity " overnight on the missing card , not even here at Earl 's , according to the person who named herself my representative . Did I want to wait and see if I located it ? She , like the barkeep , felt herself superior to carelessness and its consequences . <p> " Nah , I should cancel that card , anyway . " I should . I had debts now that Larry was in the hospital . I did n't want to bother him with them . Part of his trouble lay with over-assuming everybody 's problems . In his false largesse and skewed lucidity , he believed he was capable of solving anything . He could fix the world , he believed , if he applied the simple lessons of Zen Buddhism to every part of his day . " Flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllables , bestowed like a blessing . He 'd not slept in nearly a week when I brought him to Junction . He 'd ridden in the back seat like a pet or child , lying with his feet up against the window , explaining the inventions he had in mind to patent , the choreography that would transform his restaurant kitchen into a model of efficiency . At his intake he was asked if he felt like killing anyone , himself or others . No , no , no , he 'd said impatiently , waving at the air . Corporeal concerns had left him ; the life of the mind , he maintained . He needed time to think . That was four months ago . Our insurance , his insurance , would cover another two before raising much of a fuss . <p> " Buy you one of those ? " asked the Guinness man . My glass was empty but for the pulpy remains , a limp celery stalk , a few lime seeds and their green rind . " I 'm not going to make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm just offering to buy you a drink . " <p> " Sure . " <p> He nodded at my shirt front . " You been at the hospital ? " I looked down to see the guest sticker still stuck to my shirt . <p> " Yes , " I said . And , like him at this bar , I would be there again . Meanwhile , I would spend the morning in the warm smoky haze of avuncular concern , sipping my liquid breakfast before heading home alone . <p> The day before , Jonathan had met me at the drugstore across from the hospital , as usual . I kept waiting for my heart to leap , as it was supposed to , at the sight of the beloved . He sat looking exhausted-unshaven , hair savaged by his worrying hands-wearing mint-green scrubs , playing solitaire on his laptop computer at a plastic table . The plastic chair below looked ready to give up , legs splayed beneath his massive bulk . Perhaps it was his size that allowed him to be a nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had the wild good looks of genetic luck , and he was indifferent about them , like money he had inherited rather than earned . No doubt he would lose his handsomeness to disregard and intemperance . His muscle , someday soon , would melt to fat . <p> He smiled when he saw me , a slow spreading that made wrinkles at his eyes . It was a sad smile ; he worked with damaged people because he was damaged himself . He was a gentle giant , and there was n't one of his patients he could n't carry or restrain in his arms . His job was at the hospital psych ward , but not on Larry 's floor . Jonathan 's patients were confined to chairs or small padded rooms or the deeply debilitating doze of sedation . My husband , stabilized on a few helpful pharmaceuticals , lived upstairs . His stay was voluntary-necessary , it seemed , but voluntary nonetheless . Jonathan 's patients had not volunteered . They 'd been abandoned , or rescued , depending , but they were n't at Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer and tucked it into his armpit . " How 's it going ? " <p> " Good . " I nodded , nervous , but not in love , I did n't think . I wanted to be in love . I wanted to locate love , as I had known it , and invest it somewhere , in Jonathan , if I could . He was kind , modest , complicated , a good kisser . Why did n't I love him ? My love for my husband had burst into discrete pieces when he himself came undone . I could name them-concern , fear , fondness , pity-all separate like parts of a broken object it was my job to reassemble , an object whose lynchpin I seemed to have misplaced . If I 'd known he was going to have a psychotic break , I would have gotten pregnant last fall and by now be halfway to a new kind of love , the love of a baby-me for it , it for me , the two of us for its father , and his for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pregnant , the barhopping and the overnights in Jonathan 's bed would have been utterly unthinkable . Pregnant , I 'd have installed a little cop , helping me toe the line . <p> " So it was a good visit ? " Jonathan asked as we walked against the wind to retrieve my car . He 'd made it his chivalric duty not to meet my husband , not to learn anything of him . My husband . When we got married , twelve years ago , I could not speak those two words with a straight face . One year ago , when it was clear that my husband was unhappy but before he went completely AWOL , I had given him permission to sleep with another woman , a waitress at his restaurant . He 'd gotten as far as her bedroom , as far as a long kiss , before he changed his mind . I had been so proud of us then , me the open-minded , him the devoted , each of us choosing an unexpected course . I naively believed that represented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I lied to Jonathan . <p> He pulled on his sweater and hat as we went , shifting the computer around like a paperback in his large hands . " ' Cause there was a suicide on his floor early this morning , " he said , once inside my Saab . He sighed , unsettled . His big body absorbed bad news , trapped it inside so that it could n't afflict anyone else . <p> " Larry did n't say anything . " <p> " An Italian woman , a transfer from the ER . They treated her hypothermia over there , and then sent her our way . Nobody understood what was up with her because she was n't talking , not in Italian , not in English , nothing . She was just about to get moved downstairs when they found her . And how she got two belts , I 'll never know . One would have been hard enough . I was hoping nobody on the second floor knew about it yet . " <p> " Belts ? " <p> " Buddy Belts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She hanged herself ? That seems so ... " <p> " Painful ? " Jonathan supplied , messing his messy hair . " Desperate ? Senseless ? Retarded ? " <p> " Difficult . I would n't even know how to tie a noose . " <p> " Remember , she had belt notches to work with . " <p> " I see . " Italian , I thought . <p> " And a showerhead . If she 'd weighed any more than she did , it would n't have held . " We rode in silence to our usual first stop . " They called me to come take her down . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " The car coughed when I switched off its engine , always three coughs before it quit . " Have you touched a lot of dead bodies ? " <p> " I guess . Depending on what you think of as a lot . " He breathed audibly , as large people did . " I think more than I could count on one hand , but less than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had sex with , " I said . <p> " ' People ' ? " <p> " Men . A boy or two . " <p> " Let 's drink tequila tonight , " he said , shoving the computer under the seat and climbing out . He would forget it there , I thought . It would ride home with me tomorrow . " Tequila , " he repeated , " even though the margaritas here taste like Gatorade . " <p> We always started at the Alpine , where the Western coeds went . From there we would migrate toward Jonathan 's duplex , stopping along the way to warm up , to sink further into the drunkenness that would allow me to make love with him later . At Earl 's , fifth and final stop , where we 'd been waiting for our turn at pool , he swept me smoothly out the door when he noticed the gun inside the jacket of one of the local guys playing against the college boys . The two balls that flew off the table when he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoked a fight nonetheless . <p> " I 've dealt with enough blood and guts this week , " Jonathan claimed as we hustled down the alley . I felt half-carried , him large , me light with alcohol . The last woman he 'd held had been dead . It was only two blocks to his duplex ; our course had built into it a fail-safe drunk-driving logic . At his house we started kissing the minute we had closed the door , drama and tragedy adding , tonight , to my attraction to him : the gun tucked in the guy 's jacket played a part ; the Italian woman hanging from two belts dangled somewhere between us , my husband 's ghostly disappearing self . Love , I urged myself , biting Jonathan 's plump lip . He moved backward down the hall , me on his feet-tops like a child , past the second bedroom where his daughter stayed on the nights he had custody . Stuffed animals . A poster of a singing group , five scrubbed boys of varying skin tones , the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had liked as a girl . <p> When Jonathan lay asleep and I gazed through his skylight into the clouds , I did n't realize I was dreaming . It seemed real : I was where I was , who I was , and who I was with . But my teeth were falling out , the roots beneath them softening and letting loose one by one . Strange , dangerous men , those from Earl 's , had broken into Jonathan 's house and were wreaking havoc in the kitchen , drawers crashing to the floor , the clatter of silverware , the garbage disposal ready to eat digits and limbs , if need be-a loud fantasy in a home so silent that you could hear a clock tick . A pack of clever wolves waited outside , in case we thought we could escape . And how could anyone love me now , I kept thinking , me without my teeth ? <p> And before all that , Saturday morning at Mercy General . I was still queasy from having hit an animal with my car , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , when I saw my husband at the rec room window . I had looked up accidentally , shaking off that highway event , and there was Larry , his face and hands pressed up against the glass . His tortured expression reached into my chest . I wanted to call his name out , shout a warning , make him step back immediately . I ran into the building , passing the fish-mouthed front-desk receptionist and storming up the stairs , hurrying down the hall until I found him . He wore his black cotton pants , chest and feet naked , and stood at the floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the parking lot . I was glad to know the window was reinforced . You could see the fine wires , if you stared closely into the glass , an intricate , nearly invisible web . I stood catching my breath ; he had n't heard me , perhaps had n't even seen me down below . Larry had his hands spread reverentially on the smooth , cool surface , smearily , his cheek and chest pressed to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if listening for information carried in the wires in the glass , perhaps wishing not to break through but to squeeze into its transparency , to enter the flow . I could see his ribs , the loose skin where once he 'd been robust . His eyes were pinched shut and that was the part that most scared me . What was he praying ? And why was it so anguishing ? He was fifty-two years old but seemed older , the flesh on his face slack , his whiskers and chest hair white . I did n't know how to imagine what he was doing , or why he 'd left our home and his business , or why this place , of all the ones , was where he wished to be . <p> The receptionist from downstairs caught up with me , brandishing the sign-in form on her clipboard . Her annoyance was silenced by the spectacle of my husband . " We have to have a record , " she finally whispered . <p> For months I had entered this place murmuring my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd found him on the living room carpet among a pile of dirt and roots and broken pots , our houseplants pulled from their shelves and destroyed . " I ca n't take the responsibility , " he 'd said simply . " The responsibility is plaguing me . " Just the need to water them once a week tormented him ; he lay in the mess as if to join it , another life for someone else to nourish and encourage . I 'd thought his busking at his own restaurant was a joke , him sitting out front with a hat on the sidewalk , strumming his guitar ; then a week later he 'd fired the entire kitchen staff and given away the contents of the walk-in , thousands of dollars worth of meat and cheese and chocolate and cream . No telling what might happen next ; the head waitress had wisely locked up the wine cellar . His unhinging was erratic , some of it lighthearted . But this full-body press on the window did n't look good . It was as if he wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the landscape . <p> The receptionist was only too glad to retreat to her post . <p> " Larry , " I said . " Larry , what are you doing , baby ? " <p> He pulled himself away slowly , peeling his cheek off like a sticker . He 'd left an odd imprint , fingerprints , the squashed side of his face . " My feet are freezing , " he said , looking down as if he had just realized they were his , wiggling his toes . His nails needed grooming , along with every other piece of personal hygiene . That had been the first to go , caring about his appearance . And it had played such a large part before , since I was younger than he , and he wanted to feel presentable . Only the young could afford to be slovenly and still attract a mate . Even Jonathan , at thirty-five , would soon have to put out some effort . <p> I led Larry slowly to a couple of vinyl-covered easy chairs in the corner , grouped there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nurses and patients passed through the large rec room but paid no attention to us . Nobody really seemed to occupy the same universe here . There was something liberating about being among people so completely unself-conscious . Or maybe it was narcissism that made them seem nonjudgmental-they were too busy worrying about themselves to worry about others . But there was also something terrifying . My plan , as it had been every recent Saturday , was to have sex with Larry . Pregnancy was my only salvation , I believed , and even if I was n't ovulating , I wanted to have an explanation for when Jonathan succeeded where Larry had failed . These were the lies I lived by : not loving Jonathan , betraying my husband . Put together , they equaled a truth , which was that I needed a child . I was thirty-six and could no longer tolerate the jittery limbo of my life . Once I had a child , I would know what to do . Every move I made would have a glowing imperative attached like a corona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been having sex with Jonathan for ten weeks now , the three most recent of them unprotected . <p> Larry sat breathing hard , frightened . He searched my face as if I 'd just pulled him from the sea , as if he were still in the throes of drowning , desperate , and not quite sure that I had his best interest at heart . Did I ? <p> " Did you take a drug holiday , hon ? You know they do n't like you to do that around here . Should I run fetch something ? " <p> " Say , Martin , " he called out anxiously to a passing pajama-clad man . Here was a familiar , safe harbor . The guy smiled , tilting his head like a friendly dog . A piece of his fine brown hair flopped down like that dog 's ear . " You have n't met my wife . Come meet my wife . " Martin held his hand out as he approached : shake . There was a gap in his pajama bottoms , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd met him a few weeks before ; it was electric shock that had messed with Larry 's memory . Or maybe , in his enlightened state of mind , Larry divined my plan for an accidental pregnancy and was rebelling , deflecting my attention . I did not doubt his heightened consciousness ; it just was n't very useful , sequestered as it was in his mind , feeding like a worm on his physical substance , surrounded for months now by these reinforced walls . <p> Martin was an English professor at Ft . Lewis College , in Durango . He 'd timed his stay to coincide with a sabbatical . Alarming how thoughtful and reasonable the people on Larry 's floor were , practical in their way . Martin could , and did , recite Shakespeare . He was preparing himself for a summer repertory production of Hamlet . " ' Give every man thine ear , ' " he 'd advised me at our first meeting , " ' but few thy voice . Take each man 's censure , but reserve thy judgment . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Polonius , " he 'd said , undaunted as everyone else here by sarcasm . <p> He settled himself daintily on the arm of Larry 's chair , his pants gap now completely open , like a grin , guileless . They began discussing the possibility of pulling together a bridge foursome . There were the two of them , and one of the orderlies , and this new admission , a young deaf woman from Italy where bridge apparently was not just for the geriatric crowd . The only problem was her not being able to hear or speak , yet they were optimistic that they could work around that . Larry held up four fingers , then made a shoveling gesture : this would be four spades . Martin put a fist on his chest , pointed to his ring finger : hearts , diamonds . But what would be clubs ? And no-trump ? <p> " I just wonder how advanced she is , " Martin fretted . " You ca n't overestimate the importance of everyone 's being somewhere near the same in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy ? Not necessarily bridge ? " <p> " You have to wonder if limbo will be able to fully concentrate , with his other duties , " Larry said . <p> The television across the room was muted : another window into another world , this one of commercials aimed at children , JeIl-O , Barbie , Play-Doh , an onslaught of action and primary colors . I could still make out the prints Larry had left on the glass of the picture window . You could probably see them from below , outside . I 'd come from the windy road into the static recirculation of this room , where extraordinary minutiae made up my husband 's conversation with his new friend . He had n't seemed so banally out-of-touch , so dotty , a few minutes ago ; then , he had seemed at the zenith of misery . Which did I prefer ? Now Larry took my hand , stroking it benignly , the way he might a flat stone or the head of a slumbering cat . In the midst of their bridge party plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also because for the remainder of my time with Larry , Martin stayed perched on the chair arm . His asexual personality overruled his open PJ fly . Every week there were different but similar circumstances to help me realize the altered and mystifying atmosphere of my marriage . I was being taught every Saturday the lesson of losing him without losing him . When the buzzer sounded that meant lunch would be served in five minutes , I rose to leave . Relieved , reprieved , ready to go find Jonathan across the street . <p> " Join us ? " Martin asked politely . So mannerly , these nuts . <p> " No , thanks . You want to come with me ? " I asked Larry ; I knew he would say no ; I asked to offset my guilt , to get away scot-free . " Maybe to a real restaurant ? For a real meal ? " With real people , I wanted to add . Out there in the real world . <p> " These are real people , " he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden insight-bittersweet deja vu-made me burst into tears . A flash of heat , mucus , helplessness .

" I forgot that you played bridge ! " he said . " Honey , is that why you 're crying ? Oh , honey , you of course ought to be our fourth ! How could I be so dumb , to have for- " <p> " It 's not bridge , " I said , sniffling . " Good God . Bridge . " <p> " A Saturday game , what was I thinking ? " <p> " It 's not bridge . " My outburst was over . <p> " Are you sure ? " He cocked his head playfully , looked under his lids , nudged his forehead toward me , as if I were being coy . <p> " I am positive . Absolutely . " <p> Now he held my face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he summoned from storage , comforting me . He still performed it well . He kissed my cheeks , one , then the other , his lips so dry I could hear them chafe my face . This was as close as our bodies were going to come today . <p> " I love you , " he said serenely . In his irises I saw vast space , the blue-green of the ocean , of the sky , of the deep and crippling uncertainty that had landed him here . And I said what every coward says when challenged by that sally : " I love you , too . " <p> Before I left Telluride , I stopped by Sonny 's house to see if he needed anything in Grand Junction . Fruit or tools or some other supply . The sky was already beginning to cloud up ; my breath came in steamy puffs . He was awake early , as always , today building a dog pen out of scrap metal , old box springs and parts of a swing set , a structure he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife 's pair of matching dogs sat watching from Big Red 's truck bed , where he 'd trapped them . They wore sweaters , fat Pekinese with their smashed faces and sputtering outrage . The word Sonny applied was Warthog : noun , verb , adjective . " That 's right , Warthogs , " he said when they leapt to bark and froth at me , " let 's just see if you can warthog your warthog asses out of that . " To me he said , confidentially , " They 're starting to piss me off . " <p> Inside the house a shade slat twitched : his wife , posted at the window . <p> " You want me to come with ? " he asked , pushing back his safety goggles , welding gun pointed at the ground . Sonny would n't enter the hospital proper because sick people bothered him , but he enjoyed a trip to Grand Junction regardless . We could drive in Big Red instead of my car , listen to country music , eat burgers and drink beer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home tonight instead of tomorrow-a totally other visit , a different agenda entirely-but I knew Jane Lynn wanted him at their house . Her hand was on the blinds not fifteen feet away . They had only recently gotten back together , and one of her chief complaints against Sonny was the time he spent looking after me . And it had n't helped that for a few months he had rekindled a flame with his old high school sweetheart , her and her four children . I liked the girlfriend better than his wife ; I 'd said so twenty-some years ago , when Sonny had dropped one for the other , and it was Jane Lynn I 'd said it to . <p> The girlfriend was sweet , the kind of large happy woman whose bra strap was persistently sliding down her arm , who out of genuine affection called everyone " sugar " and hugged you goodbye wet-eyed . She had very sweet children that her complete loser of a husband had abandoned . He was in jail for manufacturing and peddling methamphetamines . I thought Sonny had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children's-rescue . The first I 'd known about his affair was when he 'd showed up at my house wearing a nasty wound on his forearm , a dirty hankie held in place with duct tape . This was where he 'd sliced off his tattoo , Jane Lynn , the wife he thought he was done with . Her name had been excised , and the sore was ugly . The arm festered , a sickening green fluid that escaped from beneath a rough brown patch of scab . Every shirt he owned had a rusty left sleeve . <p> " Did n't anyone ever teach you about infection ? Or how to get out blood ? " I asked him , pouring hydrogen peroxide over the mess , quelling nausea . <p> " I can field-dress a deer , " he said stubbornly . " I can get out a tattoo . " <p> I 'd been jealous of his flushed , renewed love . It was as if he 'd reclaimed his youth , gone merrily down that other path . He 'd be a great father ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I 'd lobbied in vain for nieces and nephews . And the girlfriend had two of each , Daisy , Adam , Melanie , Mikey , their names like a lingering jingle in my head , ready-made little blond tikes young enough to adjust , squint their big blue eyes , and view my brother as their father , me the fun aunty ... Then , not long ago , he 'd asked Jane Lynn if he could return to their marriage . <p> " I got tired of the squalor over there , " he said of the girlfriend 's home . His arm was n't even healed when he came back . Jane Lynn had made some conditions for his return . Probably he was supposed to stop spending so much time with me . I knew for a fact that drinking was forbidden , although that 's the request he made of me Saturday morning : buy him a few cases of Bud Light . He went to the truck 's dash for his wallet , taking a moment to menace the Pekinese with a hissing tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails across the slick surface of the bed . <p> " I found this under the seat a while back , " Sonny said . He handed me a spent yellow shotgun shell . It held a rolled piece of paper with my name on it and a date more than ten years past : 8-8-88 . Since I was born on 6-6-66 , I found dates noteworthy . I 'd engraved 7-7-77 all over town when that day came ; same with the 8 's and 9 's . I left my phone number on napkins tucked under the glass-tops of tables , my initials carved in the soft walls of saunas , in the boards offences , the bark of trees . A part of a poem , a line from a song , a lovelorn query , moony messages sent into the universe in search of an answer , a responding soul , that alleged prince . At a bar in junction called Earl 's , I 'd penned my initials in an equation with Jonathan 's on the wall of the women 's room stall : J.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02-02-02 , and for the first time felt a discouraging downward tilt , imagining somehow a gravestone , that other public place where dates were registered . These notes had once been a record of my own fantastic hopefulness . Beneath Big Red 's front seat I 'd tucked this one , the reverse side of which read all the little emptiness of love . . . Those eloquent ellipses I 'd drawn in , a trail of sentimental crumbs that wished to dispute the claim . <p> " That 's yours , right ? " Sonny asked . <p> " Yep . " So far as I knew , he was the only one who 'd ever found any of my messages . <p> " You want me to put that back under the seat ? " Big Red was a fixture , could be used like a safety deposit box . My brother held out his hand , and I returned the scroll in its ribbed tube . <p> On the road to Grand Junction I got teary , feeling sorry for myself . The landscape turned an Impressionistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning lights , construction cones , slow curves , bare trees furred into ash-colored fluff . My father had taught me to drive on this road , unhappy passenger pulling air between his teeth and clutching the chicken handle , stomping at what would have been the brake . When he and my mother moved away , he told Sonny to look after me . That explained Sonny 's consternation when I started dating Larry-a man older than himself-since the match would n't have pleased my father . But surely they were relieved that I was finally doing the things grown-ups did . And Larry eventually endeared himself to my family . He had taken good care of me until lately . Then in stepped Jonathan the nurse ; the first time we met he was tending me after I 'd fainted . Hospital odor : that nauseating alchemy of blood and antiseptic , the cool fluorescence of the halls , like walking into a refrigerator where half-dead people were stored , living only by the grace of machinery and medical personnel . Why should that place , the epicenter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my knees ? Jonathan sat cross-legged beside me on the floor , unalarmed , instructing me to breathe slowly and lower my head . When I told him my name was Sissy , he disagreed , " No , no , do n't worry . People faint all the time . " <p> " No , I do n't mean I 'm a sissy , I mean that 's my name . " My brother was Sonny , my parents ' son , and I was his sister , Sissy . <p> " Sissy , " said Jonathan . <p> And now , driving to Grand Junction , I thought of how I 'd lied to Jonathan . I was a sissy . I would tell him so , since it was , in fact , Jonathan I was going to see . It was Jonathan to whom I 'd turned myself over . <p> Down the familiar highway I rolled , through the little towns and the bigger ones , away from the brooding winter clouds of Telluride and into the mild high desert outside Grand Junction . Down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands selling juice and jerky . On the last long stretch of flatlands , just before the big sign that announced the city limits , a notorious speed trap where you had to drop from sixty to thirty-five in an instant , I saw the marmot . This was where I 'd been cited , three different costly times these past months ; now I knew better . Today , instead of a motorcycle cop holding a speed gun like a hair dryer , the marmot sat in the sign 's shadow , poised , quizzical , nervy . Whistling pig , big as a beaver . " Do n't move , buddy , " I murmured , tapping the brake . " Do n't you dare- " I had failed to note his partner , who suddenly dashed from the other side of the road , his brown fur the rich thick pelt of a Russian hat . I swerved but felt him bump under the back tire , soft yet fatal . I screamed , braking , putting my fingers in my mouth , and looking to the rearview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement . " Oh my God , you damn dummy ! " Injured , in violent agony , squealing . A fine spray of blood from its gasping mouth . His friend had disappeared ; there was no human traffic except me . I 'd hit animals , yet never before left a survivor . My obligation was to put it out of its misery , anybody knew that . " Sorry , sorry , sorry , " I murmured , looking once more in the rearview , longing to see another vehicle come finish what I 'd begun , my brother in Big Red , for instance , its bright rounded hood and headlights and grill familiar as a face bearing down . Some agent of mercy to do the right thing , aim his wheel at the creature 's chest swiftly and without hesitation-sparing what suffered , killing with kindness . <p> But I could n't do it . No matter how painful that backward glance-and I kept looking behind , long after the animal was out of sight-I could n't stop myself from driving away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
