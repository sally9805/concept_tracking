Making Time for a Baby <P> " Women should not have to choose between a family and a career . If two people want to raise a family , both must sacrifice equally . " SARAH ELIZABETH GLEASON South Portland , Maine <P> Author Sylvia Ann Hewlett should be hailed as a hero for her enlightening book , Creating a Life : Professional Women and the Quest for Children , but instead she is being criticized as an anti-feminist SOCIETY , April 15 . Please ! Hewlett did not invent female biology ; she only reports the facts , saying that at 27 a woman 's chances of getting pregnant begin to decline . As a mother who had a child at age 30 , I know that parenthood is all about making hard choices . Having a child is a lifestyle choice . If a woman is not willing to adjust her professional schedule to accommodate her biology , then maybe she should examine the reasons behind her motivation to have a child . ELLEN GOODMAN Glen Ridge , N.J. <P> Reasonable women will gladly sacrifice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family is truly a priority . It 's really not any more complicated than that . Women have always paid a higher price when it comes to having children , and they always will . NANCY MIXELL Oxford , Ohio <P> Exactly what is the tragedy when self-centered career women who are over 40 discover that they have " forgotten " to have a baby ? Is n't the world overpopulated already ? Career choices , like life , are full of consequences , some good , some bad . I hope your article will persuade younger women to accept their choices and their consequences . REBECCA MOCCIARO Los Angeles <P> If at age 40 I find myself in a doctor 's office , crying into a Kleenex , it wo n't mean I 've lost my identity . Although society instructs us otherwise , parenthood or childlessness need not be the keystone of a woman 's identity  --  just as neither is the foundation of a man 's . CHRISTINE PELTON HAWKINS St. Louis , Mo . <P> Why is it that men can do whatever they want in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make concerning their future ? AMY BALDWIN Scottsdale , Ariz . <P> The panic I sometimes feel at my limited procreative shelf life often gives way to anger that I can not control my ability to bear a child . Some of us are so adept at multitasking , we have come to believe that having children is a biological right . For those women who want children , the failure to have them not only teaches a sobering lesson in the limitations of science , it also provides a discomfiting look at one 's own mortality . PAMELA MATHIASEN Los Angeles <P> If indeed the ticking biological clock for women is a real problem , then all members of society  --  men and women , the business world and stay-at-home parents  --  should be involved in discussing how best to balance work and home life . All parents should be supported in their decisions , regardless of gender . It 's high time we stopped framing work-and-family discussions as women 's issues . LORI EICKMANN Dublin , Calif . <P> Jaw-Jaw or War-War ? <P> I am amazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 15 . Would President Bush have negotiated with the enemy for the custody of Osama bin Laden or other al-Qaeda fighters ? No . Then why does Bush expect Israel to negotiate with Yasser Arafat ?
