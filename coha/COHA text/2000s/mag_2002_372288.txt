The New Thinking on Breast Cancer <P> " Early detection is still the best preventive measure , and that means yearly mammograms , even in women younger than 50 . " RICHARD B. REILING , M.D. Columbus , Ohio <P> Bravo to Christine Gorman for her comprehensive article on breast cancer MEDICINE , Feb. 18 ! She certainly did her homework . I can substantiate the text of her entire article with research I did on the disease . It 's a relief to know that many other women are certain to benefit from her conscientious effort . JOANNE TOMARCHIO Coconut Grove , Fla . <P> I had my first mammogram at age 62 and another a year later . The second one showed a shadow that turned out to be an early cancer that was virulent enough to pass on to my lymph nodes . I had a mastectomy and six months of chemotherapy . Thirteen years later , I am cancer free . Without that mammogram , I would n't today be a cancer survivor . Go get that mammogram ! BERNICE RUBINSTEIN Baltimore , Md @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sexually suggestive photo on your cover ? The article is about cancer , not under any circumstances a sexy topic . You trivialized a deadly health problem that affects men as well as women . BARBARA CRYSTAL Melrose , Mass . <P> You left out one critical consideration : the cost of treatment . When a mammogram or breast exam reveals a lump or calcification , how does an uninsured woman pay for a sonogram or biopsy , let alone surgery and radiation or chemotherapy ? What good is early detection if you ca n't afford treatment ? JUDITH PLAYER New York City <P> Women are still dying of breast cancer in appalling numbers , while the cancer establishment makes billions of dollars on treatments that are not addressing the underlying issues of causation and prevention . Women do n't need more drugs to artificially regulate their estrogen levels , or more debilitating surgery . They need to know what causes breast cancer and how to prevent it in their daughters ' lifetimes . BEVERLY F. BACCELLI , PRESIDENT MASSACHUSETTS BREAST CANCER COALITION Randolph , Mass . <P> Unsinkable Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh about until I read Molly Ivins ' take on the experience MEDICINE , Feb. 18 . Regarding hair loss , I also prayed for God to leave me my eyebrows and eyelashes ; I thought losing them would make me look really sick . As for not having breasts , put it this way : if you compare my body with my 10-year-old son 's , between the neck and waist we look identical , except he is the one with nipples . Just to be here today , however , and to be able to write this make me happier than having breasts ever did . PATTY BAILEY Cambridge , Ont . <P> Thank you , Molly Ivins , for expressing your suspicion that " cancer does n't give a rat 's ass whether you have a positive mental attitude . " For years , I have tried to counter those who say peace of mind can cure cancer . Ivins came through with a great comeback !
