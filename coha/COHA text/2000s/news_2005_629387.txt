<p> The Kings had it all going well . They had a shrewd general manager , a top-drawer coach and a town that loved them . <p> It took some work to ruin all that , but they seem to have done it . <p> The trade of Chris Webber and departure of Vlade Divac sacrificed the Kings ' leadership , but those things happen . But when the Kings chased Phil Jackson this offseason , then failed to extend Rick Adelman 's contract , they turned their coach into a lame duck . <p> Just when the Kings needed to empower their coach , they cut his legs from under him . A team without leadership knew the coach was running out of time . By last week , Kevin Martin , a decent enough young player who has accomplished absolutely nothing in the NBA , could complain about his playing time and get away with it . <p> At the same time , the organization has been pushing for a new arena . This is always a dicey public relations move , particularly with owners Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! channel lives that might not need public funding . Charitable though the Maloofs are in Sacramento , it 's always a tough sell to explain why a town that fills the arena needs to do more . <p> Arco Arena might not be one of the NBA 's new Taj Mahals , but Sacramento can understandably question why it wo n't do . And the argument that a new downtown arena would enliven the neighborhood might bring up the fact that there is no downtown . <p> Team president John Thomas , whose time in Houston demonstrated his ability to alienate anyone , has been made the point man . Threats to make a deal or lose the team are no longer veiled . <p> But beyond all that , the time to seek public funding for an arena is when the team is on the way up or at the top , not while the team is in decline . <p> The Kings will likely get their arena . Sacramento will not let their one top-level professional sports franchise walk . <p> But it seems certain it will lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week <p> Rockets - At Clippers , Saturday . The Rockets get their first look at the flavor of the month . The Clippers have gone past proving they are for real to moving into first place in the Pacific Division with Satur-day 's 101-91 win over the Suns . <p> NBA - Spurs at Timberwolves , Thursday . With the Timberwolves rolling and the Spurs still the standard , " Tim Duncan " and " Kevin Garnett " offer another matchup of the league 's best ( ever ? ) power forwards . <p> ... <p> Sidekick gets his due <p> With " Scottie Pippen " ' s No. 33 going to the United Center rafters next to " Michael " " Jordan 's , " the inclination to diminish Pippen 's contributions to the Bulls ' six championships has become less fashionable . <p> It never made much sense . The Bulls won six championships . Pippen was the second-best player on the team by a wide margin . His wide variety of talents on both ends of the court went a long way to making the Bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early seasons . <p> His act in Houston - where he was incredibly high maintenance and pointed fingers more than an auctioneer - does not change what he did at his best . It also did not change his opinion of himself . <p> " I sort of look at myself as being a great player who played alongside the greatest player who ever played the game , " Pippen said . " I think it is very hard to put that into perspective when you are used to watching , I guess , a pussycat chasing a big tiger all the time . But I think I have earned my stripes in this game . <p> " I have been able to go out and do what I felt was the best that I could as a leader . I want players now to know that I was a great fundamental player and I gave it my all for the 16 years that I was able to put it on the court . " <p> ... <p> Moses imparts wisdom <p> When " Maurice Cheeks " returned to Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit . Malone 's schedule worked for him to be in Philadelphia last week , and the timing was ideal with the Sixers struggling with the concept that rebounding is permissible . <p> In town to visit , Malone also offered a rebounding clinic . <p> " The main thing is that you win ballgames by defending , playing defense , " said Malone , the game 's greatest offensive rebounder . " You play defense and you rebound . Scoring is automatically going to come . So if they do those two things , they 're going to start winning a lot of ballgames . <p> " To rebound is one of the biggest things all the time . When you rebound , only one guy got the ball and everybody 's watching that guy . He 's got to make a decision . Who 's he going to give it to ? <p> " Rebounding is the most important thing about basketball . It 's not all about scoring . It 's all about who 's going to get that rebound . " <p> ... <p> Kings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had enough concerns , but the Knicks reached Seattle and things got really tough . <p> It seems guards " Nate Robinson " and " Jamal Crawford " are both from the Seattle area , so Brown had a difficult challenge trying to continue his odd pattern of starting players in their hometowns . Why exactly Brown thinks this is important is not clear . But this seams to be his top priority . <p> In Seattle , playing both would have meant snapping " Stephon Marbury " ' s streak of 260 consecutive starts , which also mattered to Brown . So Robinson , fresh out of the University of Washington , started , and Crawford scored 31 second-half points to key the win as everyone left happy . <p> But Brown 's desire to play Secret Santa with starting assignments is more than goofy , particularly because it has gone beyond who starts , which does not matter than much , to who plays at all , which does matter . <p> In Detroit , he started local product " Maurice Taylor " , then did n't play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonics center " Jerome James " played in Seattle , then did not get off the bench against the Clippers a night later . Last month , Los Angeles native " Trevor Ariza " got the start against the Lakers , then sat out the next game . <p> So with players around the league asking for trades when unhappy with their minutes , the New Yorkers should ask to go to the Knicks , where they at least will start half the games . <p> ... <p> Not-so-happy return <p> The Jazz spent much of the season 's first month eagerly awaiting " Andrei Kirilenko " ' s return from an ankle injury . But now that he is back , Kirilenko has seemed desperate to make up for lost time , changing his game in ways that have made a mess of his offensive style . <p> Kirilenko was always a player that did not need plays called for him , scoring with energy and contributing in every way . But he has been forcing shots , overdribbling and making low-percentage passes . He is scoring just 11.5 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I still ca n't find my game , " Kirilenko said , complaining about his role and the Jazz offense . " All my shots are a little different than last year . I do n't have position for layups for some reason . I probably need to talk to coach a little bit to do something different . ... <p> " I 'm kind of running in the offense , I 'm playing , playing , playing , and like , for three or four times , I do n't touch the ball . It 's hard to play without touching the ball . " <p> ... <p> Chasing the stars <p> Though Spurs forward " Bruce Bowen " has long been known as one of the league 's best defenders , his play last week offered perhaps the most vivid demonstration of his excellence . He hounded " Kobe Bryant , Dirk Nowitzki " and " Allen Iverson " to unusual struggles . <p> Bryant and Nowitzki combined to make 12 of 46 shots . Iverson made a solid 15 of 32 shots . After Bowen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoreless in the third . <p> " I think he 's the most talented defender in the league in the sense that he guards more different kinds of players than I think anybody does , " Spurs coach " Gregg Popovich " said . " You go from guarding the Nowitzkis to point guards to ( shooting ) guards , to ( small forwards ) . I do n't know how many people can do that . He 's incredible . <p> Bowen 's defense was so tight , he got under Iverson 's skin . <p> " They let him be as aggressive from the beginning to the end of the game , " Iverson said . " They just let him get away with a lot of stuff . " <p> ... <p> Lost in translation <p> Cleveland 's " Damon Jones " is playing and talking well again , but he still seemed an unlikely choice to be the first NBA player to land an endorsement deal with a Chinese sporting goods company . But after announcing that he is close to signing with Li-Ning Sporting Goods Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company seeking to increase its profile . <p> " They felt with my personality and my glamorous looks that I could bring a little pop to the brand , " Jones said . <p> ... <p> Rant of the week : Do n't listen to this claim by GMs <p> WITH the Pacers struggling so unexpectedly , sparking assumptions that a roster shakeup might be coming , GM Larry Bird said this week that he 's listening to offers , but he 's not working the phones himself . <p> That 's mighty polite of him , but not terribly original . Every GM says that . They 're all Frasier Crane : " I 'm listening . " <p> Apparently the phones in the offices of NBA GMs do n't have buttons . They can only receive calls . <p> But if they are all only listening , who are they listening to ? Apparently trades only happen if the general managers bump into each other in the airport . <p> NOTES : **25;6866;TOOLONG
