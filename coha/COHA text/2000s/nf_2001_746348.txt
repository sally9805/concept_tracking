The argument of this article is that persuasion is a topic largely neglected by anthropologists , who prefer to see human behavior as conforming to cultural rules or driven by social forces . Drawing on his experience in the advertising business in Japan , the author examines persuasion in light of cultural heuristics available to would-be persuaders striving to create different types of social relationships . <p> persuasion ; advertising ; theory ; social relationships ; Japan <p> My purpose in this article is to raise a large issue and to offer a few examples to stimulate further research . The issue can be summed up in a single word - persuasion . <p> Persuasion is my business . In 1983 I was hired by Hakuhodo Incorporated , Japan 's second largest advertising agency , as an English-language copywriter . During the years that I worked for Hakuhodo , from 1983 to 1996 , I participated in numerous competitive pitches to large corporations . Some were to Japanese companies , presenting export advertising for use in markets outside Japan . Some were for Japanese advertising , presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such organisations as Coca-Cola , Anheuser-Busch , Buena-Vista International , Tiffany , BMW , and the Hawaii Visitor and Convention Bureau . <p> Persuasion is a major part of my life ; but when I try to discover what anthropologists have had to say about it , I find only one book on my shelves that includes the word in its title - Persuasions and Performances by James Fernandez ( 1986 ) . When I open James Wilce 's new book , Eloquence in Trouble , and turn to the index , I spot entries for Pierce , performance , performativity , and Petuli ( the name of one of Jim 's informants ) . There is no entry for " persuasion . " Determined to pursue the matter , I turn to the Library of Congress and use the Internet to search its catalogue . Searching for " persuasion " alone turns up 1292 entries . Conducting a Boolean search for " persuasion " AND " anthropology " produces zero - none whatsoever . I begin to suspect that persuasion is simply not a topic that attracts much anthropological interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthropology Index Online for a series of words , each of which denotes a communication-related topic in which anthropologists might be interested . The results of this search are striking . <p> Searching for " persuasion " produces eleven entries ; searching for " ritual " produces a hundred times as many , 1119 . Yes , there are substantial results for " marketing " ( 42 ) , " poetics " ( 46 ) , " negotiation " ( 47 ) , " storytelling " ( 47 ) , " rhetoric " ( 49 ) , " metaphor " ( 96 ) , and " performance " ( 333 ) . The measure is crude , but the overall trend is clear , as the topic shifts away from the crudities of selling to safer , more aesthetically pleasing topics , where social actors are more like stage actors and less like Willy Loman in the flesh , the more anthropological work we find . Predictable ? Yes . Still , are n't these results a little odd ? <p> I think of studies of magical healing that first assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is done . I think of studies of social movements with charismatic leaders and of careful descriptions of performances by storytellers , actors , preachers , and prophets . I think , in particular , of studies of consumerism in which the consumer is depicted as either the victim of market forces or a sturdy exemplar of resistance to them . Wherever I look , I see cases in which persuasion was part of the process but never identified - let alone the-orised - as such . <p> As a working hypothesis I offer the following propositions : As anthropologists we prefer to see human behavior either as conforming to cultural rules or as driven by social or other forces . Yes , it is true : Ethnography of the old-fashioned " X is the custom of the Y " type has long been discredited . Biography , history , and social movements are in . " Agency " has become a hot topic in social theory - discovering " resistance " has become a clich . Yet , as a group we anthropologists still , it seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freely accept what someone else has to say and to focusing attention on the salesman 's art - the sales talk by which that acceptance is secured . <p> By averting our eyes from persuasion , we ignore , however , the bulk of the on-going social activity by which market driven societies are constituted , manipulated , and driven up the spiral of endless transformation to which the economist Joseph Schumpeter gave the name " creative destruction " ( McGraw 1997 : 2 ) . To explore that form of activity we must , I suggest , leave behind the security of rules and forces and venture where anthropologists have rarely gone before . We must then examine interactions where , as I have written , " marketers are more like surfers trying to catch the next wave than engineers building dikes " ( McCreery 2000 : 5 ) , where , to borrow a wonderful phrase , meaning does n't sit still : " meaning flows " ( McCracken 1990 ) . <p> The troublesome question , of course , is how to get a handle on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave behind rules and forces and focus , instead , on heuristics , by which I mean here the schema by which professional persuaders orient their behavior and explain to themselves what they do . Watching a Master at Work <p> When I went to work for Hakuhodo , the man who hired me was Senior Creative Director Kimoto Kazuhiko . By his Japanese colleagues ' standards Kimoto-san was urusai , not only demanding but vocal about it . He did n't suffer fools gladly , and , when we started working together , he suffered a great deal . New to advertising and highly unsure of myself , I would cling fiercely to whatever ideas I came up with . Overcome with defensiveness and inspired by the folklore of Western advertising in which great copywriters secure their reputations by displaying the habits of prima donnas , I was always forgetting the wise words of Alice Buzzarte , Kimoto-san 's friend and , before she passed away , the dean of Tokyo copywriters , who had warned me during our interviews that , " In our business you have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of your brilliant ideas - are going straight into the trashcan . " <p> In the U.S.A. the creative revolution of the sixties had made irreverence heroic and created a cult of creative genius . Its heroes were men like Bill Bernbach , one of the three founders of Doyle Dane Bernbach , creator , along with art director Helmut Krone , of the impudent and highly successful ads by which Volkswagen took on the oversized , overweight , gaudily styled products of Detroit 's Big Three . One classic example was the newspaper ad in which a deliberately miniature photograph of a Volkswagen Beetle was positioned under the headline " Think Small . " <p> Bernbach and those who followed his example were ferocious critics of what they saw as the overorganization and creative dullness that had , they claimed , overtaken advertising in the mass-culture fifties . One of the most famous of these creative revolutionaries was George Lois , quoted by Thomas Frank as saying , " If you 're not a bad boy , if you 're not a big pain in the ass , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Frank 1997 : 80 ) . Frank describes Lois as follows , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> At first glance Kimoto Kazuhiko 's approach seemed a throw-back to the fifties , when American advertising agencies preached the virtues of careful scientific research and operated in the bureaucratic mode described in The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit . He wore the suit , he smoked , he drank . But it was n't the kind of market research that agencies venerated to which Kimoto-san turned for support . His approach was more direct , to study the products on which we worked - primarily copiers , printers , computers - to be sure that he knew as much or more about them than the managers in our clients ' advertising divisions . I never saw him make a presentation without sounding far more knowledgeable than anyone else in the room . In retrospect he seems to me to epitomize the Japanese marketing style that Johansson and Nonaka ( 1996 ) describe as relentless . In private he was frankly contemptuous of the agency 's claims that its market research was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products and needs . He also had strong views on how a presentation should work . <p> The agency should , he said , offer the client at least three , but never more than four or five , proposals . In the West , agencies might offer just one proposal ; but in Japan that is shitsurei , an insult to the client . The client is meue no hito , the one to whom you look up . As an oft-quoted maxim puts it , in Japan okyakusama wa kamisama ; the customer is god . Gods demand a choice of offerings , and the Western agency approach of insisting on a single proposal - whether backed by scientific evidence or claims of creative genius - would be , in effect , blasphemy . <p> Offering more than four or five proposals would , however , lead to confusion . The Kimoto approach was to carefully explain the merits of each proposal . Then , when the client asked which was the agency recommendation , he replied by reviewing his explanations , pointing out that each proposal offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important to the client . Taking a cue from the client 's response , he could then say , in effect , " Well , in that case . . " <p> My mentor was highly conscious of the fact that the people to whom we made presentations were not the real gods , their superiors , who would make the final decision . He repeatedly stressed to me the importance of providing a simple explanation for each of our proposals . It had to be simple enough , he said , for the person we told it to tell it to his or her boss . If offering only a single proposal was shitsurei , offering too many would make it impossible to keep the explanations simple . He was scathing about colleagues who offered seven or eight proposals with no explanation at all and waited for the client to make an unassisted decision . Learning to Talk Coca-Cola <p> Later , in the early 1990s , I had the opportunity to work with another great persuader . Paul Guilefoile is the best account executive that I have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a group of brothers , all of whom have followed their father 's example and achieved executive positions in multinational companies . Paul is currently the president of Kirin Tropicana , the firm in charge of marketing Tropicana citrus juice in Japan . When we met , he was working at Hakuhodo on the Coca-Cola account . <p> Like Kimoto-san , Paul also wore the suit - more often a sharply tailored blue pin stripe than the grey flannel that Kimoto-san preferred . He , too , smoked , drank , and drove himself hard . He , too , was relentless when it came to preparing strategies and re-checking every detail before we made a presentation . His presentations were also like Kimotosan 's , three or four carefully tailored proposals that would give the client a choice without making the choice too complex . What working with him added to my own toolbox of heuristics was a set of three key points about the language we used in our presentations . <p> 1 ) We must use the client 's language the way the client uses it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the linguistic level corporate culture is largely a matter of knowing and using the jargon in a way that marks you as an insider , a serious business person who knows the company 's business . <p> Especially critical here is the need to avoid the company taboos . In the case of Coca-Cola , that meant , for a ( possibly apocryphal ) example , remembering that " refreshment " could only be used of Coke . It was hard on the folks who had to come up with different expressions to describe the effects of Fanta or Sprite ; but there it was , a trap just waiting for the outsider unaware of Coke 's internal usage . <p> 2 ) We must use the client 's language a little differently . <p> Advertising agencies sell professional services . It is part of their mystique that they claim to add value to advertising that their clients ca n't add for themselves . It is thus an absolute imperative to say something that , without violating taboos , seems fresh and interesting . <p> 3 ) We must speak concretely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul impressed on me , is especially important in dealing with American companies that are legalistically inclined to insist on the letter of what they believe that they have been promised . Consider , for example , the case of the director of a TV commercial who decides at the last minute that he has a great shot in mind that was n't in the Storyboard the client approved . It may , indeed , be an improvement ; but shooting schedules are tight , and unless the client has someone present who has sufficient authority to agree to a change , the result may be a client upset by what are seen as violated expectations . Ambiguity is tactically important as a way to avoid these kinds of problems . Comparing the Tips of Icebergs <p> Comparing the presentation styles of Kazuhiko Kimoto and Paul Guilfoile to the aggressively romantic individualism attributed to George Lois , we may find ourselves tempted to leap to sweeping generalizations . The former seem so Japanese ; the latter seems so American . We have to remember , however , not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of the man in the grey flannel suit . We also have to remember than when Kazuhiko Kimoto and Paul Guilfoile made their presentations , their behavior was shaped in large part by the manners of Japanese big business , in which the relationship of agency to client , supplier to customer , is always hierarchical and , on the agency side , properly deferential . There are in Japan other styles of persuasion which appear to reverse these assumptions or seem to reject them altogether . Selling is War <p> In September , 1991 , HILL , the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living , published an issue of the Seikatsu Shimbun ( The Lifestyle Times ) in which the topic is Kudoki no Buki ( Weapons of Persuasion ) . The HILL researchers write that , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The approach used by these professionals is , it appears , very different from that of advertising executives speaking to clients who are treated like gods . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> While the Japanese agency executive 's presentation to his clients recalls the stately logic of worship , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelm his target . At least as described by HILL , in this case it is war , not worship we are talking about . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The last sentence in this description is a vital one . The agency executives not only position themselves as subordinates and supplicants in relation to their clients , their goal is to build an enduring relationship . The tension that accompanies all presentations arises from the fact that a negative response from the client may weaken or destroy the relationship on which the agency 's business depends . The sex-industry scout 's approach is , in contrast , a hit and run affair . While more intensely focused on an individual target , its verbal style resembles that of the traditional street vendor or , nowadays , the supermarket demonstrator , whose verbal pyrotechnics are a way of attracting trade from a crowd of passing strangers . Here relationships are fleeting . <p> Both the agency executive 's presentation and the sex-industry scout 's spiel have traditional roots . Arguably , each reflects an approach characteristic of the vertically organized , group-oriented society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style is shaped by the need to manage enduring , hierarchical relationships within and between groups . The other is shaped by the need to sell to strangers with whom no enduring relationship is expected . There is , moreover , a third style shaped by a different imperative . Neither an attempt to maintain close , long-term , and emotionally charged relationships within and between groups , nor a way to form and manipulate fleeting relationships with strangers , this style is , instead , associated with the forming and maintaining of loose ego-centered networks . This style is cool , laid back , detached . Relationships are desired but intimacy is not . <p> You may , perhaps , feel that the sort of verbal violence employed by the sex-industry scouts described in Weapons of Persuasion is more than a little obnoxious . Many young Japanese would , it seems , agree . Just two years after the research reported in the earlier study , HILL published Living as 1/34th . This study describes Japanese youth in their late teens and early as preferring a style of communication the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noticed , but hate putting themselves forward and absolutely detest being verbally pushed around . Now the HILL researchers write , PREFORMATTED TABLE Summing up the Argument <p> This handful of cases is altogether too small to be anything like a representative sample of persuasive communication in Japan . They may , however , suffice to suggest a few lines along which the study of persuasion might proceed . <p> Sketching broad cultural differences is one possibility . George Lois ' self-portrayal as a creative genius may seem to mark a historical break from the research-oriented style of American advertising in the fifties . But from a Japanese perspective , which insists on offering the client choices , both exemplify an excessively pushy claim that a single creative solution is the best possible one . <p> The various Japanese examples remind us , however , that what we call a culture is not so much a set of rules as a set of possible heuristics , a toolbox filled with approaches that may be more suitable in some situations than in others . The professional persuaders who work for advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouts use an aggressive hit-and-run approach whose style resembles that of traditional street peddlers . Both need to attract attention , close a quick sale , and then move on . Enduring relationships are not a feature of either business . Young people who prefer silent appeal detest this kind of pushy approach . They would like to be noticed and be able to form casual , undemanding relationships , but are wary of intimacy and intruding on each other 's space . <p> Noticing how different styles reflect different types of relationships , we may also wonder if some are more prevalent at different historical moments , in different generations , in different social classes , or in different localised subcultures . The contrast between the advertising executives ' painstakingly planned and carefully understated offerings to their client-gods and the sex-industry scouts ' aggressive bombardment of the women they pursue suggests a number of contrasts long familiar to scholars of Japan : Tokyo versus Osaka , samurai versus shitamachi . The growing appeal of silent appeal may mark an historic shift from close , " wet , " emotional relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to looser , " drier , " more detached relationships between members of ego-centered networks . <p> Returning to a global and comparative perspective , we observe that this shift from group to network is part of a process that seems to be taking place throughout the developed world . Marketing driven consumerism replaces industrial production as the engine of economic growth ( see , for example , Bauman 2000 ; Fowles 1996 ) . As this process continues to unfold , what counts as persuasive , when and where , is clearly a topic worth pursuing . Reflections on a Gap <p> Readers of an earlier version of my argument have chided me for making too little of anthropological work on , in particular , rhetoric , metaphor , and performance ; ideology and hegemony . Do I really mean to say , they ask , that anthropologists have nothing important to say that bears on the subject of persuasion ? No , that is not what I mean at all . <p> When , as an unemployed anthropologist , I got into the advertising business , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy indeed . Lvi-Strauss 's injunction to look for " a logic in tangible qualities " ( 1969 : 1 ) served me well in working with art directors . Turner 's description of the properties of dominant symbols gave me useful targets to work toward in developing what I hoped would be powerful advertising . Like dominant symbols , I thought , ads should also exhibit condensation of multiple references , unification of disparate significant , and the polarization of meaning around the sensory pole , where emotion is generated , and the ideological pole , where logic congregates ( Turner 1967 : 27-29 ) . I detected a similarity here with a familiar advertising paradigm , the conception of a brand as composed of both emotional and function benefits , unified in a powerful image . Later , I noted a convergence between marketers ' talk of " positioning , " and Fernandez 's assertion that metaphors are devices for pushing pronouns why not products ? around in cultural spaces ( 1986 : 8 ) . <p> Summoning my courage to return to the academic fray , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwanese exorcism . Now it was revealed clearly as a process by which amoral demons are persuaded to accept the social contract that empowers the exorcist to expel them . But to understand the mechanisms by which this social drama was enacted , I had to turn to the work of linguistic anthropologists on performance , and poetics , and the formalization of ritual language ( McCreery 1995 ) . Looking back , I note how beautifully Lvi-Strauss 's reanalysis of the Kwakiutl Quesalid 's transformation from skeptic to shaman ( 1993 1963 : 175-180 ) evokes my own exotic career . <p> Thanks to my readers , I now have new sources of inspiration . As I noted in my introduction , " agency " has become a hot topic in social theory . Many of us now struggle to find that militant middle ground between the equally abstract extremes of positivism and postmodernism to which Michael Herzfeld calls our attention , where we search for ways to articulate social and cultural analysis with " the intimate concerns of ordinary people " ( 1997 : 25 ) . Herzfeld 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play through which people try to turn transient advantage into a permanent condition " ( p. 25 ) sounds a good deal like branding to me . If allowed just one additional example , I would mention Cintron 's description of the moments in Don Angel 's speech , where words , " gave way to gestures and sounds during the high points of a narrative in order to more completely and dramatically represent what was being communicated " ( 1997 : 64 ) . This vijeto ( old-fashioned ) Mexican performance sounds like a great TV commercial . <p> And yet , a gap remains . For all the talk of social poetics or the rhetoric of everyday life , finegrained studies of interaction in the worlds where salesmen speak to prospects who are free to reject their offers , where hegemony or ideology may limit the range of options but do not eliminate choice , remain rare ( see , for example , Moeran 1996 ; McCreery n.d . ) . As Miller observes , there is a corps of workers who have been neglected in studies of capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dominate advertising agencies , marketing and retail " ( 1997 : 11 ) . Here our cultural maps are strangely empty , and we find ourselves tempted to see only monsters . The time has come , I think , to fill those empty spaces and take a closer look at the monsters , who , at the end of the day , may bear an uncanny resemblance to ourselves . <p> Now we have come full circle , and there are no easy answers here . There are huge gaps , indeed , in our understanding of persuasion , the salesman 's art that does , indeed , make our world go round .
