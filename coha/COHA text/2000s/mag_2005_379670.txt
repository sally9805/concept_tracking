It has been nearly 25 years since Drs . Barry Marshall and J. Robin Warren showed that the vast majority of peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori , a discovery that was honored last week with a Nobel Prize . Yet I 'm always surprised by how many ulcer sufferers do n't realize that their stomach pains can be easily and effectively cured with antibiotics . <P> A peptic ulcer is a sore in the protective lining of the stomach or duodenum ( the upper part of the small intestine ) . The most common symptom is a burning pain between your belly button and your breastbone . It 's usually worse at night or when your stomach is empty . <P> No one knows how H. pylori gets into the stomach  --  it may be through eating , touching or even kissing  --  and 80% of people who are infected with the bug never develop ulcers . There may even be some truth to the old ulcer myths : stress and spicy food do n't create ulcers , but they can certainly make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be pinned on H. pylori . Instead , they are caused by prescription and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs , such as ibuprofen , aspirin and naproxen , that interfere with the body 's mechanism for protecting the stomach lining . The ulcers are particularly common among the elderly , who take a lot of those medicines . Healing begins as soon as you stop taking the drugs . <P> Ulcers caused by H. pylori can take longer  --  two to six weeks . The usual treatment is a combination of antibiotics , acid suppressors and something to protect the stomach lining . <P> Bleeding ulcers that eat all the way through the stomach lining are a serious medical condition that can be life threatening . If you experience sharp , sudden pain in the upper abdomen or have black or bloody stools or vomiting , get emergency care . <P> Sanjay Gupta is a neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent
