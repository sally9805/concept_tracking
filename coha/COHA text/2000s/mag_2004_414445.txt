With three hit movies-Bend It Like Beckham , Pirates of the Caribbean , and Love Actually-already under her belt and King Arthur out this month , Keira Knightley is the biggest English sensation since , well , Becks. // * Hollywood is teeming with teen celebs these days , but Keim Knightley is hardly your average young starlet . That became apparent the moment the gorgeous 19-year-old walked into a coflee shop ( on time ) near her Richmond Upon Thames , England , home , weanng baggy jeans and an old , oversize sweater that did n't expose even a sliver of skin , her rich chocolate brown hair haphazardly thrown back in a clip . And then there 's the new set of fringe framing her fine-boned face , which she explains is a last-ditch effort to cover up the spots ( Brit-speak for acne ) on her forehead . Keira 's " Who cares ? " approach to her appearance is a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood divadom . But what really makes her stand out is her ability to pick small projects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over a year ago that she first scored with American audiences in the little soccer flick that could , Bend It Like Beckham . A few months later , she was back on the big screen opposite Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Carribean , which was one of the highest grossing movies of last summer . By Christmastime , she was starring with Hugh Grant in the holiday season s most adored comedy , Love Actually . No doubt her impressive rsum has something to do with the fact that acting talent-and good luck-is in her blood . The daughter of an actor father and playwright mother , Keira was horn out of a bet . Her father made a wager with her mother : Sell a play and we can afford to have another child . ( They already had her brother , Caleb , now 25 . ) Her mother sold a play , and shortly after , Keira was conceived . A precocious child , she begged her parents for an agent , and they got her one when she was 6 . At age 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Phantom Menace as Natalie Portman 's handmaiden , and she 's been working steadily ever since . This month , she returns to her epic roots in King Arthur , playing Guinevere , a ravishing beauty who 's no shrinking violet-a description you can attribute to Keira herself . Keira is animated and open about everything except whether she has a boyfriend ( it 's been reported that she 's dating Irish model Jamie Dornan ) , and she 's always ready to laugh at her supposed flaws . And that makes her even more perfect in our eyes . C You showed off fancy footwork in Bend It Like Beckham . Did you play soccer as a kid ? K I was very sporty at school . I was captain of the girls ' soccer team , but I still had to learn to play for Beckham , because my version of playing soccer was being fast and kicking people in the shins . It was n't : proper stuff . I did about 20 weeks of training for the movie . C Did you ever meet Becks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Madrid and I sat behind Posh Spiee , which is the closest I 've ever gotten to David Beckham . He was meant to come to the premiere here in London , but he broke his toot , so he did n't make it . C Speaking of hot guys , tell me about the first time you met your Pirates of the Caribbean costar Johnny Depp . K was really , really nervous . We had the road-through in his club in L.A. , the Viper Room . When I saw him come in , I had my teenage moment . Johnny sat down next to me and turned to me and said , " Hey , you must be Keira . " He had just had his gold teeth done that day for the movie . And I just said , " Oh God , what 's happened to your teeth ? " C What is your favorite scene from Pirates ? K The stuff on the island with Johnny , because I can say I 've been stuck on a desert island with Johnny Depp . C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest film . King Arthur ? K This film is a different take on the classic story . This is action . British women used to fight alongside the men , so it is historically accurate . Guinevere 's a strong woman who tries to seduce Arthur and Lancelot . That made her very interesting to play . C She kicks a lot of butt . How much training did you do ? K When I took the role , the producers said , " Listen , we want you to bulk up . We want you to be a lot bigger than you are . " I trained about four days a week for three months before the movie , and then pretty much every day when filming started . I 'd do an hour and a half to two hours of weight lifting , and then I would spend three hours boxing , fighting , or horseback riding , even though I never ended up riding in the film . C You 're only 19 , and you 've already done a few nude scenes in The Hole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . All the people I 've worked with so far have been incredibly protective . I just did another one for The Jacket . I went up to John , the director , and said , " fust make this look good , I do n't care . " It 's just part of the work . C What 's your type of guy ? K Athletic but with something going on upstairs or it 'll never last very long . Intelligence is very important . Even if the guys not aesthetically pleasing , he can become really attractive if he 's smart . I also think dreadlocks are great ... and shaved heads . C What 's your biggest turn-off when it comes to guys ? K Vanity . If a guy spends a long time in front of the mirror in the morning , you know there 's a problem . C What 's your ideal date ? K It has to be something really stupid . The most fantastic date I 've ever had was going bowling , because I do n't bowl and I 'm awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date . C What 's something about you that 's very British ? K I have n't had my teeth straightened . Are n't British people known for having crooked teeth ? It 's funny , when I was in L.A. , people were like " Wow , your teeth are n't actually that bad . " C What do you do for fun ? K I 've started to cook . I make a damn good lemon pie . I 'm cooking coq au vin tomorrow and having people over . I also love art galleries and shopping . I 've got a big shoe thing that I 'm trying to curb . I paint and draw , but very badly . I also take bad photographs . C What 's your biggest regret ? K Not finishing college . I left after three months ... I was desperately unhappy there . You have to have a backup in this business , and I do n't have that , and that 's terrifying . But it also makes you work harder . C What 's the hardest thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sight reading is still a big problem ... it 's always something that is ( mite embarrassing . I 'm also incredibly self-conscious about my body . People send over dresses for me to wear to these functions , but I often feel like a 5-year-old in my mom 's clothes . So I just wear jeans and a top every single time . But I 'm going to tiy to wear a dress ... maybe to the King Arthur premiere . It will be a long one . I would never wear a short skirt . C Do you work out and watch what you eat ? K I should exercise more than I do , but I am very lazy , so I do n't . And I was about to say I do n't eat junk food , but ice cream and chocolate is pretty junky , is n't it ? My mom has always kept pretty healthy things in the house . We eat fresh , good food ... no chucking all the crap in . I would say we do eat a lot of pasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sensible about it . 1 do n't believe in any of those crazy diets . C What 's something you 'd like to change about yourself ? K I 'd have longer legs and bigger tits . C YOU looked pretty voluptuous in Pirates .... K The cleavage was painted in . It was amazing . It took 45 minutes every single morning for the bloody makeup artist to paint it in . Its all about shading . C What 's your biggest girlie indulgence ? K Manicures , pedicures , and facials . I am getting into it , which is odd because I was always a tomboy . But I had to start getting facials to get all the makeup off , and it felt great-you teel like a lady afterward . I 'm a big bath girl as well . When I 'm on vacation , I 'm running a bath . C What 's the craziest rumor you 've heard about yourself ? K Apparently , I 've had my lips done . A journalist phoned up my agent the other day and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . We have a picture of her coming out of a plastic surgeon 's . " My agent said , " She 's 19 , she has n't had her lips done . She has n't had any plastic surgery ! " Jesus , I mean if they had been accusing me of wanting to get a boob job , I could understand that . But my lips ? C What 's the weirdest thing a fan has ever said to you ? K A guy in the Glasgow airport came up to me and said , " I 'm really sorry , but can I kiss you ? " I let him . C I 'm sure you made his day . K Maybe he made my day . Sidebar " A guy in the airport came up to me and said " Can I kiss you ? " I let him . " Sidebar KEIRA 'S CRUSHES Here are the hotties who JOSH HARTNETT " He 's so cute .
