Chapter One THERE ARE FOUR ACKNOWLEDGED WAYS of meeting your maker : You can die by natural causes including illness ; you can die by accident ; you can die by another 's hand ; and you can die by your own hand . However , if you live in Washington , D.C. , there is a fifth way of kicking the bucket : the political death . It can spring from many sources : frolicking in a public fountain with an exotic dancer who is not your wife ; stuffing bags of money in your pants when the payer unfortunately happens to be the FBI ; or covering up a bungled burglary when you call 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue home . Michelle Maxwell was currently stalking the pavement in the nation 's capital , but because she was n't a politician , that fifth choice of mortal exit was not available to her . In fact , the lady was focused only on getting so wasted she 'd wake up the next morning with a chunk of her memory gone . There was much she wanted to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , pushed open the bullet-pocked door of the bar and stepped inside . The smoke hit her first , some of it actually from cigarettes . The other aromas were rising off substances that kept the DEA jacked up and in business . Brain-piercing music crushed all other sounds and would provide an army of hearing specialists with lucrative business in a few years . While glasses and bottles clinked , a trio of ladies ground it out on the dance floor . Meanwhile , a pair of waitresses juggled trays and bad attitudes , all the while prepared to slug anyone attempting to grab their ass . The bar 's collective attention turned to Michelle , the only WASP in the house this or probably any other night . She looked back at them with enough defiance that they returned to their drinks and talk . That status could change because Michelle Maxwell was tall and very attractive . What they did n't realize was that she could be nearly as dangerous as a bomb-wrapped terrorist and was looking for any reason to put her foot through someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back and wedged in , nursing her first drink of the night . An hour and more drinks later , the woman 's rage began to swell . Her pupils seemed to grow dry and harden , while the rest of the eyeball eased to a blood red . She lifted a finger at the passing waitress who satisfied her thirst one last time . Now all Michelle wanted was a target for the fury that had laid claim to every square inch of her . She swallowed the last drop of alcohol , stood and whipped her long dark hair out of her face . Michelle 's gaze zoned the room grid-by-grid looking for the lucky one . It was a technique the Secret Service had pounded into her head until that instinct of observation became the only way she could look at anything or anyone ever again . It did n't take long for Michelle to find the man of her crystallizing nightmare . He was easily a head taller than anyone else in the place . And that head was chocolate brown , bald and beautifully smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlobe . His shoulders spanned about a mile . He wore baggie camouflage pants , black military boots and an Army green shirt that showed bare arms full of knotted muscles . He stood there sipping his beer , swaying that big head to the beat of the music , mouthing trash lyrics it was impossible even to hear . Definitely her kind of guy . Michelle shoved aside a man who stepped in front of her , walked up to this living mountain and tapped him on the shoulder . It felt like she was touching a block of granite ; he would do very nicely . Tonight , Michelle Maxwell was going to kill a man . This man , in fact . He turned , slipped the cigarette from his lips and took a swig of beer , the mug barely visible in his bear paw of a hand . Size did matter , she reminded herself . " What 's up , baby ? " he said , idly blowing a smoke ring to the ceiling and taking his gaze off her . Wrong move , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggered backward , knocking down two smaller men . The impact sent a shock wave of pain from Michelle 's toes to her pelvis , so hard was his chin . He tossed the mug at her ; it missed , but her slashing front kick did n't . He bent over as air was torn from his gut . Michelle next slammed a vicious kick to his skull with such force she could almost hear his vertebrae screaming over the apocalypse of the music . He fell back , one hand pressed against his bloody head , eyes wide in panic at her raw power , at her speed and precision of attack . Michelle calmly eyed both sides of his thick , quivering neck . Where to hit now ? The trembling jugular ? The pencil-thick carotid ? Or perhaps the chest cavity , throwing his heartbeat into a fatal misfire ? And yet it looked like the fight had gone out of the man . Come on , big boy , do n't disappoint me . I came all this way . The crowd had cleared back except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming her man 's name . She aimed a meaty fist at Michelle 's head , but Michelle deftly sidestepped the charge , grabbed her attacker 's arm , bent it behind her and gave her a push . The lady kept right on going , taking down a table and two patrons sitting there . Michelle turned back to confront the boyfriend , who was doubled over , breathing hard and clutching his gut . He suddenly made a bull run at her . That charge was halted by a crushing kick to his face , followed by an elbow thudding against his ribs . Michelle finished this off with a neatly executed side-kick that disrupted a good bit of the cartilage in his left knee . Screaming in pain , the big man dropped to the floor . The fight had now turned into a slaughter . The silent crowd took one collective step back , unable to believe David really was kicking the crap out of Goliath . The bartender had already called the cops . In a place like this , 911 was the only number on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks of things it was doubtful they would be in time , though . The big man managed to stand straight up on his one good wheel , blood running down his face . The swells of hatred in his eyes said everything that needed to be said : Either Michelle had to kill him or he was going to kill her . Michelle had seen that same look on the face of every son of a bitch she had ever kicked the male ego out of and that list was impressively long . She 'd never started one of these fights before . They usually resulted from a thick-headed slob hitting on her and not reading the not-so-subtle cues she sent back . Then she would stand up to defend herself and the men would fall down , with an imprint of her boot on their knuckled heads . The blade whipped at Michelle after being pulled from the mountain 's back pocket . She was disappointed by both the choice of weapon and the feeble thrust . She sent the knife sailing away with a well-aimed kick that broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back touched the bar . He did n't seem so big now . She was too fast , too skilled , his superior size and muscle were useless . Michelle knew that with one more shot she could kill him : a snap of the spine , a crushed artery ; either way he was six feet under . And from the look on his face , he knew it too . Yes , Michelle could kill him and maybe vanquish the demons inside her . And that 's when something snapped inside Michelle 's brain with such ferocity that she almost deposited all the booze in her belly on the heel-scarred floor . For perhaps the first time in years Michelle was seeing things as they were really meant to be seen . It was startling how fast the decision was reached . And once she made it , she did not revisit the issue . She fell back on what had dominated her life : Michelle Maxwell acted on impulse . He threw a weary punch and Michelle easily sidestepped it . Then she aimed another kick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamp a big hand on her thigh . Reenergized at having finally seized his elusive quarry , he lifted her up and threw her over the bar and into a shelf of wine and liquor bottles . The crowd , delighted at this change of events , started chanting , " Kill the bitch . Kill the bitch . " The bartender screamed in fury as his inventory spilled over the floor , but he stopped when the big man came over the bar and laid him out with a wicked uppercut . Next , he picked Michelle up and twice slammed her headfirst into the mirror that was hanging over the demolished booze , cracking the glass and maybe her skull too . Still enraged , he drove a massive knee right into her gut , and then threw her to the masses on the other side of the bar . She hit the floor hard and lay there , her face bloody , her body going into spasms . The crowd jumped back when the big man 's size sixteen boots landed next to Michelle 's head . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her body dangling like a spent yo-yo . He studied Michelle 's limp form , apparently deciding where next to hurt her . " In the face . In the damn face , Rodney . You mess it up good , " screamed his lady , who 'd picked herself off the floor and was dabbing at the beer , wine and other crap staining her dress . Rodney nodded and swung a big fist back . " Right in the damn face , Rodney ! " his lady screamed again . " Kill the bitch ! " barked the crowd a little less enthusiastically , sensing the fight was just about over and they could return to their drinking and smoking . Michelle 's arm moved so fast Rodney did n't even seem to realize he 'd been struck in the kidney until his brain told him he was in awful pain . His scream of fury actually drowned out the music still ripping from the bar 's sound system . Then his fist connected to her head , once , knocking a tooth out ; and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Big Rodney was hauling back for the crusher when the cops kicked down the door , guns out , looking for any reason to start shooting . Michelle never heard them come in , save her life and then arrest her . Right after the second blow landed she started to fade into unconsciousness and did n't expect to be coming back . Before she blacked out completely Michelle 's final thought was simple : Goodbye , Sean . The events and characters in this book are fictitious .
