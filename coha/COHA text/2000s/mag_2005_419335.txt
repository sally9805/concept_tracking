Here , the Mediterranean Sea narrows down to a width of just 10 miles before connecting to the Atlantic Ocean on the west side of the Straits . It 's a short sea crossing , and it 's also where Africa and Europe practically touch . As a result , the Straits have played host to a variety of invading armies over the centuries . This is where Arab culture meets European culture , where Muslim meets Christian . Cruising these waters , the sense of history is palpable . I had arrived in Spain to join a flotilla of boats scheduled to cross the Straits to Morocco from Puerto Banus , near Marbella on the Mediterranean side . Sea Ray International and Marina Marbella of Spain had coordinated the boats for the cruise . Among them were new models from Sea Ray , Boston Whaler , Baja and Sea Pro , in sizes ranging from a 68-foot cruiser to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready to depart , the forecast called for 25-knot winds in the Straits , so most of the boats stayed behind . Two of the larger Sea Rays , including a 68 I was on , got under way . This was a day trip to Morocco . I was looking forward to checking out the marina development in that part of the Arab world , where there 's potential for exciting new cruising grounds . Virtually all boats entering the Mediterranean from the Atlantic automatically turn north to head along the Spanish shore , and for good reason . This is sophisticated boating country . With such nice amenities in the north , could Morocco lure boaters in the other direction ? As we moved into the Straits , there was plenty of shipping traffic , as there often is . Skippers in these waters need to keep a watchful eye , particularly for the fast ferries . This area seems to have its own weather climate , too . The wind gets funneled into the narrow passage so there are always stronger gusts here than outside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it running in opposite directions . On our crossing , the wind was from the east , and when it met the current flowing to the east , the seas became difficult and unpredictable . Both Sea Rays coped well with the challenging conditions . We were able to run 25 knots most of the time . As we approached the African shore , we saw big swells . We seemed to literally surf into the marina entrance at Smir . There are few places in the world where you can travel by boat from one continent to another in just 10 miles . And there are few places with such a rich history . Millions of people have sailed this course before . This is where the Visigoths and the Vandals started their invasion of Europe . The Phoenicians were here , and later the Romans . Then it was the French , the Spaniards and the British who all laid claim to this critical entrance to the Mediterranean . British Admiral Horatio Nelson finally established control just 200 years ago . The crucial points of the area are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcroppings that mark each side of the Straits . To the north is Gibraltar , which is still British despite the fact that it 's connected to the Spanish mainland.To the south is Ceuta , which , strangely , is Spanish owned . Gibraltar is comprised of towering cliffs , a defining point for the end of the continent of Europe . Ceuta is much less dramatic , but nonetheless , a well defined navigation point from which we steered along the African coast . As we approached Smir ( on the Mediterranean side ) , police were in evidence . We produced our passports , and all was handled without any of the aggression I 've encountered in some other countries . It seems Morocco is in a period of change . This was evident even in the confines of the marina , which is relatively new and meets all modern requirements . There were men in flowing robes and camels standing alongside sleek , fiberglass yachts . I took a short bus ride into town where the contrasts are even greater . There are modern highways and buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed in centuries . A maze of alleys climbs up the hill above the town and comprises the market . Here you can buy everything from disposable diapers to live chickens and rabbits . A strong stomach is recommended for a walk around here . The bazaar sells traditional crafts , carpets , silverware and exquisite wood carvings . I came out of the souk wondering if it was a film set or the real thing . Back on board the Sea Rays , it was time to begin the two-hour ride back to Puerto Banus . We did n't get far before we saw the police again . The Spanish police maintain a heavy patrol presence along the coast due to the smuggling of both drugs and immigrants . It 's no surprise that our two fast powerboats running in the gathering darkness attracted their attention . They came alongside and sent a boarding party to check us out . When they realized that we were a group of harmless boaters , they became friendly , but it was not difficult to sense the tensions that exist in this region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats without lights trying to scurry across the Straits under the cover of darkness . All in all , it was a lot of adventure for one short day . Morocco is worth a longer visit . There is so much to do and see , particularly along its Atlantic coast , including places like Casablanca and Tangier . And there are enough marinas and ports to offer a variety of cruising experiences . Illustration <p>
