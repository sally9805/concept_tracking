WHILE LEADING the Steelers to seven straight wins , rookie Ben Roethlisberger has been drawing raves about his arm strength . ( " It 's what I would call rare , " Chargers coach Marty Schottenheimer told SI.com . ) But the 6 ' 5 " , 241-pound quarterback knows that consistent , hard throws have as much to do with his core as with his arm . " It 's important to get your core strong because you do so much twisting and rotating when you 're throwing , " says Roethlisberger , who has worked to strengthen his midsection since his high school days in Findlay , Ohio . Steelers assistant strength and conditioning coach Marcel Pastoor now trains Roethlisberger up to three times a week , concentrating on the QB 's abdominals , obliques , hip flexors and lower back . // Roethlisberger -- whose QB rating of 101.3 is fourth in the AFC -- says a powerful core is especially helpful when he 's being chased . " Your technique kind of goes out the window when you 're on the run , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hips , abs and back . You can use the torque and twist of your body to help give you a couple extra yards . Having a strong core definitely helps me get more velocity on my ball . " Even if you do n't play football , a strong core helps bridge lower- and upper-body strength , improving posture and easing even basic home chores . Here 's a look at Roethlisberger 's routine . // MEDICINE BALL TOSS // Once a week Roethlisberger and Pastoor play catch with a 12- to 16-pound medicine ball , doing two sets of 10 tosses . Pastoor says it mimics the finish of a pass because the arms are going forward , the hips back . // MEDICINE BALL SIT-UPS // Pastoor stands above a supinme Roethlisberger and drops the medicine ball . Roethlisberger catches it in mid-sit-up , brings it to both sides ( left ) , then throws it back . ? The exercise strengthens his hip flexors , obliques and abs , and Roethlisberger does two sets of 10 , concentrating on the rotation of his body . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do because it strengthens all around your stomach , " says Roethlisberger . But he cautions , " You do n't want to do it too close to games if your ribs are hurting . " // ROTARY TORSO TWISTS // Steeler 's trainers introduced Roethlisberger to this exercise , done on the aptly named rotary torso machine , and it quickly became a favorite . ? " This is n't too painful , and you ? get good results , " says Roethlisberger , who does one set of 10 to 12 rotations in each direction to work several of his core muscles . ? " Most guys do crunches and only get their stomachs . ? It 's important to have all of it , but for me it 's more important to have strong obliques the sides of the abdomen than to have a strong stomach . " // SWISS BALL HYPEREXTENSIONS // In this lower-back-strengthening exercise Roethlisberger 's size works against him . ? " His legs are long , so he 's at a mechanical disadvantage , " says Pastoor . ? " It 's easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of 12 to 15 reps , lying on an exercise ball and raising his legs from the floor to the position shown , where he holds for two seconds before lowering . ? " My lower back always got sore easily . ? This has helped , " he says . ? " It gives me a stronger twist when avoiding tackles . ? It really helps me get away from those guys . "
