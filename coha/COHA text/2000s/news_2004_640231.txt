<p> The reputedly apathetic youth voters that political candidates have been ignoring for decades are coming to life . <p> Energized by 9/11 , the war in Iraq and lukewarm job prospects , 18- to 29-year-olds have awakened from a deep political sleep . <p> For the first time since the ' 60s , college students are buzzing with an activism focused on improving campus life , influencing state and local policies and choosing the next president . <p> At least that 's how some campus observers see it . The real test will come in November . <p> ' This year we could see a million more college voters than in 2002 , ' says Dan Glickman , director of Harvard University 's Institute of Politics . <p> ' Considering that the ( 2000 Gore-Bush ) race was decided by less than a half-million votes , politicians will ignore them at their own peril . ' <p> Student activists do n't look much like their counterparts from the ' 60s . Some still stage sit-ins , but most prefer to staff voter-registration booths , boycott companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesting by not buying Pepsi or by downloading music because they do n't agree with the recording industry , ' says Robert Rhoads , University of California at Los Angeles associate professor and author of ' Freedom 's Web : Student Activism in an Age of Cultural Diversity ' ( Johns Hopkins University Press , 1998 ) . <p> Glickman says students are inspiring others to vote by having ' a peer ask them , face-to-face ' to get involved . <p> George Culpepper keeps busy between classes at Metropolitan State College of Denver doing just that , and by agitating in the name of the Republican Party . <p> Technically , his mission was to found an Auraria campus chapter of the College Republicans and motivate them to promote the party 's agenda . But ask Culpepper about his favorite achievements , and he answers unabashedly . <p> ' I 've been stirring up trouble , ' he says . <p> Last fall , the 29-year-old ex-Marine raised his campus profile by resigning from a campus organization to protest what he calls the liberal leanings of the club 's sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The group meets once a week to assign volunteer jobs , share dates of upcoming state Republican events and plan activites . At the end of the hour , they celebrate the coverage they 've garnered in area newspapers . <p> In the past several weeks , that 's included speaking out against a campus environment they describe as uncomfortably liberal and an affirmative-action bake sale . <p> Culpepper and another student have filed grievances against a political science professor , alleging she was biased against them because of their conservative politics . Those grievances were reported in the CU-Denver Advocate , along with a statement from the professor saying she has since received death threats and hate e-mails . <p> ' It 's a typical liberal tactic , making her look like a martyr , ' Culpepper says . <p> To reward Culpepper for keeping a high profile , the Colorado GOP asked him to serve as state chair of the College Republicans . He 'll start the new job in March . <p> Instead of dropping out like their counterculture peers , activists are signing up to work within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true for students of color , women , gay and lesbian students and others who feel marginalized . <p> Students came together in the ' 80s to protest apartheid , but their level of activism changed when the threats got closer to home , Rhoads says . <p> ' We started noticing an uptick in student interest in poltical engagement and voting after 9/11 , ' says Glickman , whose Institute of Politics has been studying students for five years . <p> ' What tends to get people interested in politics are local issues , ' he says . Sergio Gonzales is a case in point . The 2000 Columbine High School graduate was n't interested in politics until his second year on the University of Colorado 's Boulder campus . <p> ' I joined groups that help Latinos and other under-represented students feel comfortable on campus , ' says the grandson of Colorado activist Corky Gonzales . ' While I was in those groups , I became familiar with other issues . ' <p> Gonzales spent his junior year on CU 's Legislative Council , then was elected student body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now 22 and a registered Democrat , Gonzales says he is proudest of the nonpartisan things he accomplished on campus . Among them : improving the quality of life and forging a better relationship with city officials . <p> Gonzales spent his summer crafting the S.H.E . ( Support for Higher Education ) campaign and this fall built grassroots support that carried it to the state legislature this month . <p> He also organized a troop of volunteers to staff information tables on campus , help students write postcards to their legislators ( about 4,000 were mailed from CU 's campuses ) , and talk with parents , businesses and public school teachers about the funding cuts . <p> And he hired three people to staff a New Voters Project , registering students to vote in upcoming elections . By November , he hopes to have 90 percent of the student body registered and ready to voice their opinions to Colorado 's state legislators . <p> Although he admits he ca n't prove it , Gonzales says he believes interest in politics is growing among his generation . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect us ' <p> He also thinks his generation is learning how important it is to express its opinions in the voting booth . <p> ' When you have American idols and MTV talking about how cool it is to vote , you get that message over and over . Young people are starting to wake up . ' <p> In election years since 1992 , MTV has waged a Choose or Lose campaign that calls on recording artists to spread the message : Voting is cool . <p> Viewers moved to register or get further involved can do so on MTV 's website . And should students want more information about the candidates and the issues , MTV produces news shows directed toward its young viewers . In 2000 , it hired reporter Gideon Yago to cover the presidential campaign , and in 2003 it sent Yago to Kuwait to cover the war with Iraq . <p> If viewership surveys are any indication , it 's working . Young viewers voted Yago among their top 20 most trusted sources of information , higher than Dan Rather , Peter Jennings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2000 , 17.6 million ( about 73 percent ) actually voted . This year , MTV hopes to help get 20 million to the polls . <p> If the Iowa caucuses are any indication , that goal should be easy to meet . Youth turnout in Iowa was four times greater than in 2000 . <p> Political leanings <p> A Harvard University Institute of Politics poll last month found 31 percent of students described themselves as Republicans , 27 percent Democrats and 38 percent Independent or unaffiliated . <p> A UCLA poll of incoming freshmen in September found 24 percent described themselves as liberal , 21 percent as conservative . The largest group called its politics ' middle of the road . ' <p> 61 percent of college students approve of the president 's job performance , compared to 54 percent of all 18- to 29-year-olds . <p> 37 percent of all 18- to 29-year-olds say they would vote to re-elect Bush ; 34 percent would vote to elect someone else . <p> 87 percent of college students ( including 70 percent of Republicans ) say ' members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ' mostly not telling the truth ' about the situation in Iraq . <p> 87 percent of young Republicans say the Bush administration made the right decision to invade Iraq , compared to 38 percent of young Democrats . <p> Sources : Harvard University 's Institute of Politics poll , Oct. 2003 ; UCLA 's American Freshman annual survey , Sept. 2003 ; Pew Research Center survey , Jan. 2004 ; Newsweek Poll , Jan. 2004.
