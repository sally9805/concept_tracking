I stood in the doorway and stared . I 'd never seen a school dormitory before , and I could n't believe my eyes . It was a long , thin room , and although the walls were a lovely rose-pink , it was so empty . Just six dressers , six chairs , and six beds arranged in neat and tidy rows . And a thought hit me -- zonk ! I was going to have to share with five other princesses ! I gasped . I did my best to pretend it was a sort of cough , but it was n't easy . And then I saw something else , and my mouth dropped open , and I really could n't close it . Not one of the beds had satin sheets ! The sheets were plain white cotton but did look very clean . All the same -- how could any princess be expected to sleep on plain cotton sheets ? " Now dear , unpack your things and make yourself at home . " Queen Gloriana smiled at me as if everything was perfectly normal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the first one here in Rose Room , but the other princesses will be arriving any minute . They 're all lovely girls , and I 'm sure you 'll become great friends ! " The principal waved again as she glided away , her long velvet skirts brushing the floor as she went . " Thank you , Your Majesty , " I said as politely as I could , but my heart was thumping . I hurried to the window and lookedout . I was just in time to see my father 's golden coach glinting in the sunshine before it turned the corner of the driveway and disappeared . If I had n't heard someone com-ing up the stairs , I 'd have cried my eyes out . I mean , what was this place ? I 'd been reading up about The Royal Palace Academy for the Preparation of Perfect Princesses for ages . The brochure was full of pictures of sweeping staircases and the magical lake with swans floating on their own reflections . Best of all , there was the Princess Academy Annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful ballroom ever , with a dark blue ceiling lit by millions of tiny sparkly stars , and lots and lots of the most beautiful princesses in the loveliest dresses twirling around and around the room . And it all happened on the very first evening of the new school year ! I 'd been dreaming about the Birthday Ball . I could imagine every head turning as I drifted onto the dance floor . I 'd decided that my dress would be soft pink with lots of swirly petticoats , and my tiara would be so sparkly that everyone would be completely dazzled . No one would ever notice my hair was a boring brown color and my nose was n't exactly perfect -- because if I was at the Princess Academy Birthday Ball , then I 'd be beautiful too . I nagged and nagged Mom and Dad until they said I could go to the Academy , and then I nagged a whole lot more until Mom agreed to let me have the dress I 'd imagined . ( It was n't exactly right , but it was close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school year . But as I stared miserably out of the window , I knew I 'd made a huge mistake . Queen Gloriana was scary . The school was too big . The dormitory was awful . I did n't want to share a room with anyone , let alone five girls I 'd never even met . I decided I absolutely had to run away . At once . " Hello , " said a voice from the doorway . I turned , blinking hard so whoever it was would n't see I was nearly crying .
