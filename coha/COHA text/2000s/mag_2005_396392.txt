New interventions needed to save infants and to spare mothers <p> During roughly every minute you spend reading this article , a mother somewhere in the world will pass on to her infant HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Damming this current of HIV transmission would be rather simple from a medical standpoint . But it requires either a daunting financial cost or a Faustian biological bargain in which a mother acting in her infant 's best interests may reduce her own later chances of avoiding full-blown AIDS . Researchers are searching for a better deal , but with every passing minute , another newborn gets the virus . <p> In prosperous countries , a woman with HIV can begin a lifelong course of drugs that not only increases her life span but also cuts her chance of passing the virus on to her baby during pregnancy , birth , and breast-feeding from 25 to 40 percent to less than 2 percent . But in much of the world , the cost of continuous treatment is prohibitive , and physicians must make calculated trade-offs to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That task gives rise to the Faustian bargain . Two well-timed doses of a single drug , nevirapine  --  one dose going to the woman as she begins labor and the other going to the infant within the first 3 days of life  --  can substantially cut a newborn 's risk . The treatment drops the baby 's chance of acquiring HIV to less than half what it would be without any medication to mother or child . <p> For that benefit , however , a mother takes on a dire risk . She may develop resistance to anti-HIV drugs that persists for months or years . If nevirapine or related drugs are later used to treat these mothers as their HIV infections progress toward AIDS , the medications may not help . <p> What 's more , drug resistance in the mother may be detrimental to her later babies because nevirapine might no longer reduce the risk of transmission . <p> Recent studies have evaluated these benefits and risks . Now , health officials are looking for inexpensive treatments that protect both mother and child . <p> <p> DEFENSIVE DELIVERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic part of prenatal care . But in developing countries , many women do n't receive any medical attention during pregnancy or do n't have access to HIV drugs . Worldwide , less than 10 percent of women with HIV receive any treatment to prevent HIV 's spread to their infants , estimates James McIntyre of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg , South Africa . <p> The inexpensive drug nevirapine can rapidly cut the concentration of active HIV particles in the mother and , if given promptly to the newborn , may prevent any virus that slips in from taking hold . <p> A landmark study called HIVNET 012 , which has been under way in Uganda since 1997 , has determined that , for preventing mother-to-child transmission , nevirapine is superior to the drug zidovudine , which was previously given to mothers late in pregnancy and to infants in their first week of life . Nevirapine cut transmission risk during the first 18 months of life to 16 percent , compared to 26 percent transmission with zidovudine . <p> The trial did n't test advanced drugs , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim markets as Viramune , is cheaper than the more effective drugs and is sometimes provided free of charge . Since 2000 , the Ingelheim , Germany-based company has donated some 400,000 doses of its drug to prevent infections in newborns in dozens of developing countries . Elsewhere , generic doses of it can sell for about 25 cents each , and several international AIDS organizations subsidize the drug for treating pregnant women . <p> Public perception of single-dose nevirapine treatment took a nosedive after media reports last December exposed flaws in the Uganda study , in particular , incomplete record keeping surrounding possible side effects , such as liver toxicity and skin reactions . The study is funded by the U.S. government and includes researchers at the National Institutes of Health , based in Bethesda , Md . <p> In the wake of the revelations , a number of people , including key African political figures , discouraged the use of nevirapine in pregnant women . Concerns about HIVNET 012 have had " a chilling effect on the use of this drug , " says pediatrician Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Turning away from the treatment is wrongheaded , says McIntyre , and most other HIV researchers agree . <p> Whatever the study 's flaws , McIntyre says , its fundamental conclusion is still correct . Single-dose nevirapine is " a safe intervention and effective up to a certain point , " he says . " For the 90 percent of women who have access to nothing , I still do see a role for single-dose nevirapine . " <p> Following the controversy , a nine-member committee of the Institute of Medicine in Washington , D.C. , reviewed HIVNET 012 . In an April 7 report , the panel reaffirmed the trial 's findings . Nevirapine is justifiably the cornerstone of efforts to reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in much of the world , says Kline , who served on the panel . <p> Nevertheless , says McIntyre , in light of the controversy , the need to find better alternative treatments has never been more urgent . <p> <p> CRUSHING RESISTANCE At the crux of the nevirapine dilemma is HIV 's skill at developing resistance to antiretroviral drugs . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete any prescribed course of antibiotics , physicians prefer to hit HIV with steady doses of medication rather than with intermittent wallops . <p> To become resistant to nevirapine , HIV needs only one chance mutation at any of several sites in its genetic code . Substantial quantities of the drug linger in the body for up to 3 weeks after a single dose , and that lag gives the virus plenty of time to evolve . <p> A study of Thai women last year demonstrated the consequences of nevirapine resistance . Gonzague Jourdain of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and his colleagues recruited 1,844 pregnant women infected with HIV . Some of the women received a dose of nevirapine as they entered labor . <p> The women were observed for up to 4 months after delivery . If their health worsened , they were prescribed a daily antiviral drug regimen that included nevirapine . <p> Among the women who had not taken nevirapine , the drug regimen benefited two out of three by suppressing viral activity for at least 6 months . Among those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later drug regimen , Jourdain and his colleagues reported in the July 15 , 2004 /New England Journal of Medicine/ . <p> Other studies indicate that most genetic mutations that make HIV impervious to nevirapine simultaneously give the virus resistance to related drugs known as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) . This group includes many of the most widely used anti-HIV drugs . <p> In the short term , emerging resistance may make little difference to a mother who could n't afford HIV drugs . But the World Health Organization has an operation under way that aims to deliver , by the end of this year , a steady supply of HIV drugs to 3 million infected people who ca n't afford to purchase them . Infected mothers with dependent infants might be a natural choice for priority care , but because of nevirapine exposure during childbirth , many of those women may not get the full benefit of the drug . <p> New methods of detecting resistance ( see " Recognizing Resistance , " below ) are assessing how long nevirapine resistance lasts . Sarah Palmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her colleagues took blood samples from 29 pregnant women who were about to receive single-dose nevirapine and from the same women up to three times in the 14 months following delivery . They then tested each of the blood samples for nevirapine-resistant HIV . <p> Standard viral testing indicated that drug resistance arose in the majority of the women and then fell , with no resistance measurable 11 months after the single dose of the drug . But according to a new assay that Palmer 's team developed , 88 percent of women who 'd shown evidence of drug-resistant HIV on at least one postdelivery test still carried some resistant virus 11 months after delivery . <p> Those data , which Palmer presented in February in Boston at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections , suggest that at least 22 percent of women receiving nevirapine during childbirth still harbor drug resistance more than a year later . <p> What these findings mean in terms of health and sickness remains unclear , Palmer says . <p> Apart from the danger that nevirapine resistance may pose to mothers , Neil Martinson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subsequent children born to those women . Nevirapine resistance in mothers might render subsequent maternal doses of the drug useless , making transmission of HIV more likely at the end of a later pregnancy , he says . <p> In a pilot study of 186 women that Martinson and his colleagues recently conducted in Soweto , South Africa , prior use of nevirapine seemed to increase the risk of HIV transfer during a later pregnancy . Martinson says that the resulting transmission rate , 14 percent by 6 weeks after birth , was n't as high as he feared it might be and that the difference observed between the groups might be due to unrelated factors . <p> Nevertheless , he and his colleagues say , more data are urgently needed to inform doctors ' decisions , as HIV-infected women are increasingly returning to birth wards in places such as Soweto after taking nevirapine at least once before . <p> <p> NEW APPROACHES To stop resistance from arising in women who take nevirapine for the sake of their children , researchers are investigating several combinations of relatively inexpensive drugs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , Franois Dabis of Victor Segalen University in Bordeaux , France , and his collaborators treated 329 pregnant women in the Ivory Coast from the 32nd week of gestation until 3 days after each had delivered . The researchers administered two daily antiviral drugs , zidovudine and lamivudine . Moreover , they gave each woman a dose of nevirapine at the beginning of labor and each child a dose of that drug on the second day after birth . The newborns further received daily zidovudine for the first week . <p> Using conventional methods , the investigators monitored the blood of the infants and mothers for drug-resistant HIV for 6 weeks after delivery . <p> Fewer than 10 percent of the women appeared to develop drug-resistant virus during the study , and most of those who did had virus resistant to lamivudine rather than nevirapine , the researchers found . Less than 5 percent of the infants acquired HIV , Dabis reported at the Boston conference in February . He concludes that a short course of combination therapy before delivery leading up to a one-time-only dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that drug . <p> In a separate study , Palmer and her colleagues compared rates of nevirapine resistance in 10 women who had received single-dose nevirapine only and 22 similar women who had also received either 4 or 7 days of Combivir , a drug that contains zidovudine and lamivudine , following delivery . <p> Using the newer , more sensitive assay , the researchers found that resistance was three times as frequent with nevirapine alone as with both Combivir and nevirapine . Palmer described those findings on June 8 at the 14th International HIV Drug Resistance Workshop in Quebec City . <p> Another approach under consideration is withholding the mom 's half of the single-dose nevirapine treatment , thus preventing virus within her from being exposed to the drug and developing into a resistant form . At least two teams of researchers are exploring this option . <p> One trial was conducted by Robert Shapiro of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and Ibou Thior of the Botswana-Harvard School of Public Health AIDS Initiative Partnership in Gaborone , along with their colleagues working in Botswana . They demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of nevirapine to the child soon after birth seems as effective at preventing infection as is a dose to the mother during labor and to the newborn . However , the study did n't estimate the risk of such women developing zidovudine-resistant infections , which could limit their options for future treatment . <p> In a different study , McIntyre and his colleagues treated infants whose mothers had n't received nevirapine with either a single dose of nevirapine or 6 weeks of daily zidovudine . In both approaches , less than 20 percent of the infants became infected during their first 3 months of life . The study did n't follow the infants beyond that age and did n't assess zidovudine resistance . <p> While the researchers have n't directly compared either of these regimens with a regimen that includes giving mothers nevirapine , they suggest that , in certain situations , exclusively treating infants to prevent infection may be a valid alternative to giving drugs to mothers . <p> In light of the recent studies , the World Health Organization is considering whether to more strongly encourage health workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of nevirapine and one or more other drugs , rather than nevirapine alone . <p> Permanent , multiple-drug therapy should continue to top the list for people who have access to it , says Dabis . But numerous simpler alternatives are needed because the availability of specific drugs varies greatly from region to region . For many women , he says , single-dose nevirapine is still the most effective practical treatment for preventing infections in newborns . <p> The several recent studies on mother-to-infant HIV transmission have marched in parallel through phases of design , data collection , and analysis , Dabis says . " We will have to live with this data for quite a while , " he says , because many of the scientists are near the end of their current round of research , and completing the next round of studies will take several years . <p> Although many questions remain , Dabis says , making recommendations about medical treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women is something " we can not defer .
