He had just awakened from the dream when the tunnel coming out beneath Hut 109 collapsed . It was just before dawn , and it had been raining hard off and on since midnight . It was the same dream as always , a dream about what had happened to him two years earlier , as close to being as real in the dream as real was until the very end . In the dream , he did n't see the convoy . In the dream , he did n't suggest turning and attacking . In the dream , they did n't get shot down . And in the dream , no one died . Raymund Thomas Hart , a skinny , quiet young man of unprepossessing appearance , the third in this family after both his father and grandfather to carry the saint 's name with its unusual spelling , lay cramped in his bunk in the darkness . He could feel damp sweat gathered around his neck , though the spring night air was still chilled with the leftover cold of winter . In the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the weight of the rain-soaked earth and the air filled with the whistles and shouts of the guards , he listened to the thick breathing and snores of the men occupying the bunk beds round him . There were seven other men in the room , and he could recognize each by the distinctive sounds they made at night . One man often spoke , giving order to his long-dead crew , another whimpered and sometimes cried . A third had asthma , and when the weather turned damp wheezed through the night . Tommy Hart shivered once and pulled the thin gray blanket up to his neck . He went over all the familiar details of the dream as if it were being played out like a motion picture in the darkness surrounding him . In the dream , they were flying in utter quiet , no engine sound , no wind noise , just slipping through the air as if it were some clear , sweet liquid , until he heard the deep Texas drawl of the captain over the intercom : " Ahh , hell boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . Tommy , find us the way home , willya ? " In the dream , he would look down at his maps and charts , octant and calipers , read the wind drift indicator and see , just as if it were a great streak of red ink painted across the surface of the blue Mediterranean waves , the route home . And safety . Tommy Hart shivered again . His eyes were open to the nighttime , but he saw instead the sun reflecting off the whitecaps below them . For an instant , he wished there was some way he could make the dream real , then make the real a dream , just nice and easy , reverse the two . It did n't seem like such an unreasonable request . Put it through proper channels , he thought . Fill out all the standard military forms in triplicate . Navigate through the army bureaucracy . Snap a salute and get the commanding officer to sign the request . Transfer , sir : One dream into reality . One reality into dream . Instead , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain 's command , he 'd crawled forward into the Plexiglas nose cone of the B-25 to take one last look around , just to see if he could read a landmark off the Sicilian coastline , just to be completely certain of their positioning . They were flying down on the deck , less than two hundred feet above the ocean , beneath any probing German radar , and they were blistering along at more than two hundred fifty miles per hour . It should have been wild and exhilarating , six young men in a hot rod on a winding country road , inhibitions left behind like a patch of rubber from tires squealed in acceleration . But it was n't that way . Instead , it was risky , like skating gingerly across a frozen pond , unsure of the thickness of the ice creaking beneath each stride . He had squeezed himself into the cone , next to the bomb-sight and up to where the twin fifty-caliber machine guns were mounted . It was , for a moment , as if he were flying alone , suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , separated from the rest of the world . He stared out at the horizon , searching form the rest of the world . He stared out at the horizon , searching for something familiar , something that would serve as a point on the chart that he could use as their anchor for finding the route back to the base . Most of their navigation was done by dead reckoning . But instead of spotting some telltale mountain ridge , what he 'd seen just on the periphery of his field of vision was the unmistakable shape of the line of merchant ships , and the pair of destroyers zigzagging back and forth like alert sheepdogs guarding their flock . He 'd hesitated , just an instant , making swift calculations in his head . They 'd been flying for more than four hours and were at the end of their designated sweep . The crew was tired , eager to return to their base . The two destroyers were formidable defenses , even for the three bombers flying wing to wing in the midday sun . He had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , and the line of ships will be out of sight in seconds and no one will know . But instead , he did as he 'd ' been taught . He had listened to his own voice as if it were somehow unfamiliar .
