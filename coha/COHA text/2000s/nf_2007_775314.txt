Twice as Good // Alabama , 1892-1962 // The story of Condoleezza Rice begins at the close of the nineteenth century on a cotton plantation in southeastern Alabama , near the flourishing little town of Union Springs . The area was on the edge of Alabama 's Black Belt , named for the rich soil and slave labor essential for cotton , the state 's number one cash crop . By the early 1890s the slaves had been free for more than a generation , but so many remained as sharecroppers on the masters ' plantations that planters still controlled the lifeblood of the land . New railroads that intersected in Union Springs had only made the planters richer , as their grand Victorian and Greek Revival homes attested . Now they could send their cotton to the markets in Montgomery in hours instead of the days it had taken by mule . // In 1892 , according to the census records of the surrounding Bullock County , Condoleezza Rice 's grandfather , Albert Robinson Ray III , was born . His father was a plantation field hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice family lore , was the white owner of the plantation , and his mother was a favored black servant in the plantation household . The family has no written record of Alto , and there are no clues in the 1890 or 1900 Bullock County census records . Rice knows little about Alto-her great-great grandfather-or the nature of his relationship to her great-great-grandmother beyond the apparent one of sexual exploitation of servant by master common to this place and time . " I know that Alto , who was white , was either Italian-born in Italy and made it here somehow , or his parents made it here somehow , " she recalled in an interview years later . // Rice also knew that one of her great-aunts , Nancy Ray , had sandy-colored hair and blue eyes . That was clear from the photographs of Nancy that Rice saw as a child , and from the recollections of her parents and grandparents . White ancestry was common to other middle-class black families in Birmingham , and across the South-one of Rice 's black friends claims a Jewish judge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was no cause for shame . Many black household servants were taught to read , were exposed to fine things like " silver and china and linen , " and came to learn " about how advantaged Americans lived , " said Rice 's friend Freeman Hrabowski , a Birmingham native who is now the president of the University of Maryland , Baltimore County . ( Hrabowski says his great-great-grandfather was a white slave owner from a plantation near Selma . ) One of Rice 's friends has recalled jokingly discussing with her whose white ancestors were more aristocratic . " It was just sort of part of the landscape , " Rice said . // Whatever the specifics of Rice 's ancestry-the family says there were white landowners , favored household servants , and education going back generations on her father 's side as well-the important point is that it powerfully shaped her view of herself as a black patrician . Any serious look at her life must begin here , in an intermingling of the races and two separate strands of American history . Rice grew up seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the least , her ancestry was a crucial part of the self-confidence that fueled her rise . She never considered herself an outsider or called herself an " African-American " - to her ears an immigrant designation she has always rejected . // " We have a racial birth defect that we 've never quite dealt with , " Rice said . " Which is that , really , there were two founding races-Europeans and Africans . They came here together , there was miscegenation . We founded and built this country together , and we are more intertwined and intertangled than we would like to think . " She has long said that the shock over Thomas Jefferson 's relationship with the slave Sally Hemmings was misplaced and naive , although she acknowledges the legacy of rape that produced so many mixed-race children in the South at the time . " It 's a legacy that was basically not one of choice and volition but of violence and oppression , " she said . " And so I think that 's why people have trouble admitting it and talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , the Italian ancestry appears to have been a source of pride , or at least was valued enough to make the family pass Italian names down through succeeding generations . Albert Robinson Ray III 's brother was named Alto , and later , Albert would name one of his own sons Alto-Alto Ray , Condoleezza Rice 's uncle . Two of the other children of Albert-Angelena and Genoa-also had Italian names . // Condoleezza is of course an Italian name , too , made up by Rice 's mother from the Italian musical notation , " con dolcezza , " which means " with sweetness . " The family story has always been that Rice 's mother picked the name because she was a classically trained musician and loved Italian opera . But in an interview in late 2006 Rice suggested that her name was in part inspired by the man she believes to be her Italian ancestor . " Alto , as you can tell , is an Italian name , " Rice said , adding , " as is Condoleezza. " // In Union Springs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Condoleezza Rice 's grandfather , other than his likely labor in the cotton fields . Rice family lore picks him up again at the age of eleven , around 1904 , when a white man is said to have assaulted his sister . Albert responded to the attack by beating up the white man , a crime so severe for a black youth that he fled Union Springs , terrified that he would be lynched . His fears were not unfounded : Like much of the South , Bullock County experienced a sharp erosion of black civil rights after Reconstruction ended in 1877 . Between 1889 and 1921 in Bullock County there were seven documented lynchings. // As the Rice family tells it , Albert ended up at a Birmingham train station at 3 a.m . Somehow-the family has few details-Albert met a white family , the Wheelers , who owned a coal mine and took him in . Albert lived with the Wheelers and worked in their mine until well into his twenties . // Albert Ray may have been fleeing , but in 1904 he was also following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magic City , " the name given to Birmingham only three decades after its birth . // The city had been incorporated in 1871 by ten investors who formed the Elyton Land Company in what was then the town of Elyton and bought 4,457 acres of mineral-rich property at a point where two major railroads were expected to intersect . By the start of the twentieth century , Birmingham was a booming postwar manufacturing city , named for the gritty industrial center in England , and was said to be the only place on earth where the essential ingredients of iron- and steel-making-coal , iron ore , and limestone-existed in one spot . Birmingham was heavily dependent on poor black laborers like Albert Ray , who helped fuel a growth so phenomenal that in 1904 , the same year he arrived in town , the city 's boosters chose Vulcan , the Roman god of fire and the forge , as the symbol to promote Birmingham worldwide . The city sent a giant statue of Vulcan as its exhibit to the 1904 St. Louis World 's Fair , where it won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , today Vulcan overlooks Birmingham from the top of Red Mountain . He has had a more recent and direct role in Condoleezza Rice 's life : During George W. Bush 's 2000 presidential campaign , Bush 's foreign policy advisers-Rice was their coordinator-nicknamed themselves the Vulcans , after the statue in Rice 's hometown . At first the name was an inside joke , but the advisers began to use it publicly because it captured the image of power , toughness , and durability they sought to portray . // In 1918 , Albert Ray was still working in the Wheelers ' mine when he married , at the age of twenty-eight , Mattie Lula Parham , a classically trained pianist and a graduate of St. Mark 's Academy in Birmingham , an institution Condoleezza Rice later recalled as a " finishing school . " Parham 's father , Rice said , had been " somebody high up in the African Methodist Episcopal Church . " The family does not know how Albert and Mattie Lula met , but Rice does know that they settled in Hooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years 1923 and 1936 they had five children-another Albert , another Mattie , Angelena , Alto , and Genoa . Mattie , with her classical training , gave piano lessons to the children in the neighborhood , for 25 cents a lesson , and Albert , with no education , branched out from coal-mining to a blacksmith business and then construction . He built the house the family lived in , at 3708 Fourth Street West . As he prospered , he added on , expanding from five rooms to ten . He also dug the well , kept cows and pigs , and owned a car . The Rays were the third or fourth family in Hooper City , upwardly mobile for the time , and proud . // " I guess we might have been poor , but we never knew we were poor , " Genoa McPhatter , the youngest child , said . " I can remember we always got practically everything that we wanted . " The family dressed well- " Mother shopped at expensive stores for us , so consequently we grew up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " My daddy had a lot of white friends , " McPhatter said , recalling how whites would come in for horseshoes to her father 's blacksmith shop . " To be perfectly frank , we did n't even realize when they would come that it was segregation , because they had such a good relationship there together . " // Albert and Mattie Lula sent all five children to black colleges in the South : Tuskegee in Alabama , Spelman in Atlanta , Johnson C. Smith in Charlotte . Angelena , Condoleezza Rice 's mother and the middle of the five children , stayed home and graduated from Miles College in Birmingham . In the family , she stood out for her musical abilities-she played the piano like her mother-and for her sharp tongue . " She was a very sweet , kind child , but do n't say anything to her , " McPhatter recalled of her older sister . " If she did n't agree with what you were saying , if she felt like it was wrong , she could really lash out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Birmingham at Fairfield Industrial High School , in a black working-class community of the same name that overlooked the massive U.S. Steel mills . Angelena was a refined presence in the scruffy town-beautiful , light-skinned , with an insistence on standard English . " The thing I remember most is she drilled us in writing , " recalled Richard Arrington , Jr. , Birmingham 's first black mayor , who was one of Angelena 's students . She taught him , he recalled , to say " had gone " instead of " had went . " " Nobody had ever told me that , " Arrington said . " My parents had come out of the Black Belt and we spoke black dialect in our home . " One of Angelena 's other students was Willie Mays , a source of family pride , which Condoleezza Rice made sure to mention in an early meeting with George W. Bush , a lover of baseball and the former managing partner of the Texas Rangers . // It was at Fairfield High that Angelena met a fellow teacher , John Wesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charismatic and outgoing . On Sundays he preached in Birmingham at Westminster Presbyterian , a position he had inherited from his father . The preaching job was part-time , as was common in those days . From Monday to Friday Rice taught gym and served as Fairfield 's head basketball coach and assistant football coach . Although he did not have the property of the Rays , there was education and white ancestry in his family , too . // John Rice 's grandmother was Julia Head , the mixed-race daughter of a white plantation owner-Condoleezza Rice 's **27;489;TOOLONG another favored black house slave from Greene County , in western Alabama . As the family lore has it , when Union soldiers ransacked the neighboring plantations at the end of the Civil War , Julia , under instructions from her white father , hid the horses from the Northern invaders-an act of loyalty , or at least of obedience , that the family cites today . // Julia could read and write , as could the man she married , a former slave from South Carolina named John Wesley Rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia and John Rice settled as tenant farmers in Greene County , where they raised a son , also named John Wesley Rice , Condoleezza Rice 's grandfather . John Wesley Rice eventually graduated from Stillman College , the historically black school in Tuscaloosa , an accomplishment of such note in the Rice family that Condoleezza Rice made it a centerpiece of a speech she gave at the 2000 Republican National Convention . In what was effectively her introduction of herself to the nation , Rice told the delegates in Philadelphia the story of " Granddaddy Rice . " Her narrative , which made clear that she was from a black educational elite , set out the themes of self-reliance and godliness much admired by her Republican audience . // " George W. Bush would have liked Granddaddy Rice , " Rice told the delegates . " He was the son of a farmer in rural Alabama , but he recognized the importance of education . Around 1918 , he decided he was going to get book-learning . And so , he asked , in the language of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Granddaddy Rice was told of Stillman , where he enrolled but ran out of cotton to pay for tuition after his first year . What was he to do ? " Praise be , as he often does , God gave him an answer , " Condoleezza Rice told the crowd . " My grandfather asked how those other boys were staying in school , and he was told that they had what was called a scholarship . And they said , ' If you wanted to be a Presbyterian minister , then you can have one , too . ' Granddaddy Rice said , ' That 's just what I had in mind . ' " // Rice drove home her point : " And my family has been Presbyterian and college-educated ever since . " // Granddaddy Rice 's education encompassed literature as well . In a story that Condoleezza Rice has often told , her grandfather spent the astonishing sum of $90 during the Depression on seven leather-bound , gold-embossed books , including the works of Dumas , Shakespeare , and Hugo . When Rice 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay for them over time . ( In later years his niece , Theresa Love , Condoleezza Rice 's aunt , would go to the University of Wisconsin and get a Ph.D . in Victorian literature. ) // Granddaddy Rice 's first congregation was in Baton Rouge , but the church soon dispatched him to start schools and Presbyterian congregations all over the South . By 1943 , he had settled in with his last congregation , a small mission in Birmingham that became Westminster Presbyterian . In 1951 , after the church had completed a new building on Sixth Avenue South , he turned over the pulpit to his son , John Wesley Rice , Jr. , the gym teacher and high school coach who had earned a divinity degree , as his family expected , from Johnson C. Smith University in North Carolina . // Three years later , on Valentine 's Day 1954 , John Rice , Jr. , and Angelena Ray were married by Granddaddy Rice in Angelena 's mother 's music room in the family house in Hooper City . The wedding was tiny-and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and only child was born . " My mother said it was a good thing I was n't early , " Rice recalled . //
