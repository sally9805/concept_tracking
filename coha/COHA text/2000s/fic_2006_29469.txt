Chapter One KING PETER A heavy transport bearing the Earth Defense Forces logo settled onto the Whisper Palace plaza to the sound of cheering almost loud enough to drown out the landing jets . An honor guard carved a safe corridor through enthused spectators toward the shuttle and laid down a purple carpet for King Peter and Queen Estarra . Taking steps in perfect synchronization with hers , the young King spoke from the corner of his mouth so none of the professional eavesdroppers could hear . " I so rarely get to announce good news that is n't an outright lie . " Well aware that Chairman Basil Wenceslas was watching and ready to respond if they made the slightest wrong move , Estarra answered with equal caution . " We 've had to report the deaths of soldiers far too often . Greeting genuine returning heroes is a vast improvement . " No one had expected to find EDF soldiers alive this long after the battle of Osquivel ; the missing men and women had been presumed killed by the alien hydrogues . Now , blinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the debarkation ramp , jostling each other as if they could n't wait to drink in the air of Earth . All of the smiling refugees wore new uniforms provided bythe rescue crew . According to reports , they had immediately ejected the clothing given to them by their Roamer captors ( or was it " hosts " ? Peter wondered ) out the disposal chutes . Barely able to contain the ecstatic mob , the guards let the corralled VIP relatives and selected loved ones forward . During the return voyage , former Chairman Maureen Fitzpatrick had transmitted the names of the POWs . Excited families bounced from one rescued survivor to another until , like puzzle pieces , the right ones interlocked with hugs , joyous shouts , and mutual weeping . Despite this glowing reception , Peter knew the Hansa government was thoroughly embarrassed to find anyone there . The EDF 's clash with the hydrogues at Osquivel had been an utter disaster and a frenzied retreat . Many wounded soldiers were left to die aboard disabled vessels and unclaimed lifepods . But a band of Roamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fallen had gone to the ringed gas giant with the intent of establishing a memorial , and by sheer coincidence had encountered the Roamer shipyard and secured the hostages ' return . Without question , many more soldiers could have been rescued if the panicked EDF had n't abandoned them . Once the heady celebration was over , people would begin asking questions . Basil , you certainly have egg on your face , Peter thought and realized that that was when the Chairman proved most dangerous . Behind his eyes he saw a memory-flash of bloodied water , butchered dolphins , lifeless glassy eyes of the once-playful sea mammals : Basil had not reacted well to the leaked news of the Queen 's unsanctioned pregnancy . Peter could not get the smell of blood and saltwater out of his nostrils . " Keep to the schedule , " Basil 's voice scolded from his tiny ear microphone . " This is taking too long . " He squeezed Estarra 's hand and faced the transport , waiting for the main event . Sensing an even greater spectacle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a thud and a groan , metal sliding against metal . Interior floodlights shone with a glow like banked fires . Soldiers and cargo handlers used lifting apparatus and gravity-reducers like wranglers transporting a chained prehistoric monster . A small hydrogue derelict . Roamers had found the dead ship drifting in the rings of Osquivel after the great battle . Though this scout vessel was less than ten meters in diameter , the crowd drew in a near-simultaneous gasp of amazement and fear . As lifters lowered the derelict to the ground , Maureen Fitzpatrick approached Peter and Estarra with her grandson , one of the thirty refugees , and shook the King 's hand as if he were a business partner . As a former Chairman , Maureen understood both how little power Peter truly wielded and the necessity of playing the game . " Sire , we had to let the Roamers escape in exchange for this derelict . I hope you agree it was an acceptable bargain . " " I 'm sure the Roamers wo n't cause us any particular harm . " He considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted vital military resources . Another one of Basil 's boondoggles . " You made the right decision . Now we have an intact enemy ship to study . I will see to it that both of you receive recognition for your service . " Pleased to be in the limelight again , Maureen looked like a plump cat that had just swallowed a whole mouthful of canaries . Estarra looked at the quiet young grandson of the old Chairman . " You seem distracted , Mr. Fitzpatrick . Are you well ? " " Sorry-I was ... thinking about someone . " " All this talk about Roamers must be distressing to him . " Maureen touched the young man 's arm . " He and the rest of the EDF survivors deserve a long furlough , King Peter-if I can convince General Lanyan of that . " Hansa scientists hurried into the security zone , eager to get their hands on the alien ship . Engineering Specialist Lars Rurik Swendsen was like a child unwrapping the largest present at a birthday party . " Just look at it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be able to build counterparts using similar technology . This could be the biggest advance since producing Soldier compies from Klikiss robot designs , or ... or the Klikiss transportals themselves . Just think of it ! " The tall Swede looked as if he might start dancing . Maureen interjected , " We 've also secured detailed notes and logbooks from tests performed by a Roamer engineer . Some of the data may be useful . " Dignitaries came forward to have their images taken beside the hydrogue ship . With so much disheartening news lately , media reporters would seize upon this happy story , just as they had repeated the unofficial announcement of the Queen 's pregnancy . Even so , this small derelict was a grim reminder that the hydrogues could strike Earth at any time . However , Peter thought of Basil lurking behind shadows in the Palace , it would be refreshing to confront an enemy who is n't afraid to face you . ( Continues ... )                @ @ @ @ @
