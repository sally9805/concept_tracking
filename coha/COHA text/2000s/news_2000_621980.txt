<p> A few years ago , Irish writer Joseph O'Connor apparently had run out of novel ideas for his novels and hit upon the gimmick of visiting the 16 communities called Dublin in the United States to see how they compared to the original  --  the real  --  Dublin . <p> Bear in mind that O'Connor is the brother of rocker Sinead , so readers knew to expect the snideness to be laid on as thick as a fake Irish brogue . He condemned Dublin , Ga. , for racism , upbraided Dublin , Texas , for being a dry town ( not a Guinness stout to be had ) and wryly observed that Dublin , N.H. , is the home of the magazine Yankee . <p> O'Connor 's sharpest barbs , however , were reserved for our beloved Dublin , jewel of the Tri-Valley and celebrator of all things Irish this weekend with its annual St. Patrick 's Day festivities . <p> Our Dublin is dismissed by this babbling bloke as a " vast and seemingly unending sprawl of shopping malls , discount furniture warehouses and drive-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like raving individualists . " Oh , and this about the town 's ambience : " dreary and brain-dead . " <p> Ouch . Not even Wilde at his meanest could skewer a town as thoroughly as O'Connor did our Dublin . What did our faux Dublin ever do to deserve this literary lashing , except pay homage to its more more famous and historic namesake each March ? In rebuttal , here is Nancy Feeley , executive director of the chamber of commerce of our fair ' burb : " That 's a very unfair depiction of Dublin . We 've gotten past all that . I heard that that Irish writer just quickly drove through town . Anybody who 's actually been in our Dublin knows there 's more to it . " <p> Indeed , our Dublin is a jewel as precious and rare as the Emerald Isle . And that 's no blarney  --  so help me Frank McCourt . A visitor just has to look hard enough to see so many , many similarities . After all , that 's what Irish immigrants Michael Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the Bay Area for a place to settle , saw the green rolling hills and said something to the effect of " Park it here , lads . ' T is the verdant heath for us . " <p> Our Dublin revels in its link , however tenuous , with the one in Ireland . The town turns green this weekend with its usual St. Patrick 's Day festivities , including the parade , festival and dinner-dance . Representatives from Bray , Ireland  --  Dublin 's sister city and a suburb of the real Dublin  --  will be in town . And Guy Houston , our ' burb 's mayor , is going across the pond , along with Dublin High School 's marching band . <p> Walk up to any Dubliner and ask her about Irish history , and she 's liable to get it right . Tami Brugman , sipping coffee in a Starbucks at Hacienda Crossings , gladly took our impromptu multiple choice quiz . She knew that James Joyce , not Joyce Carol Oates , wrote " Dubliners , " and that hurling is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last call . <p> " I 've only lived in Dublin a year after moving from Hayward , " Brugman says , " but I think it 's neat how ( the city ) makes a big deal out of St. Patrick 's Day . " <p> Indeed , all things Irish pervade Dublin 's streets this weekend . Sorry , Mr. O'Connor , but your Dublin 's got nothing on ours . Let us compare : <p> THEIR DUBLIN : Kilmainham Gaol has attained world renown for housing  --  and executing  --  some of Ireland 's most famous freedom fighters from the Easter Rising in 1916 , including James Connolly , Padraig Pearse and Joseph Plunkett . <p> OUR DUBLIN : The Federal Correctional Institution has gained world renown for housing such outlaw luminaries as Patty Hearst , Ted Kaczynski , Michael Milken and Heidi Fleiss .

" <p> OUR DUBLIN : A thriving suburban metal scene in the late ' 90 produced the Tri-Valley quintet Total Eclipse , whose next gig is next Friday night at Club Boomerang on Haight Street in San Francisco . The group 's signature tunes include " Guardians of Metal , " " Bloodbath " and " nevermore . " <p> " We 've got a good response in Europe , " says drummer Ramon Ochoa , who reports that Total Eclipse still has n't found the record contract it 's looking for . <p> THEIR DUBLIN : Its public transportation system , DART , alienated commuters with a recent rail strike . Passengers also have complained about lack of parking spaces at DART stations in numerous letters to the editor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strike since 1997  --  and , hey , the Dublin-Pleasanton station had barely opened by then .
