SOMETIME DURING THE NIGHT , my breathing simply stops . I wake , chest throbbing , and suck hard at the air . But it is as if fingers have pinched closed my trachea , as if 1 am drawing breath through a sponge . I heave my body forward , reach for the walls , the light switch , anything . This is real : I am going to suffocate . The room blurs and darkens . Somehow , a needle point opens in my throat , allowing a thin stream of oxygen into my lungs . Consciousness edges back toward me , and in the moment of clarity I grab for the telephone and punch the number I know from previous emergencies . I try to say Eddie 's name , but my voice is a wisp , static on the wire . Even so , the woman who answers knows me . " Bunny , " she says . " Bunny , you 've been told not to call this line . " But , I try to say , but- Panic swells against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is holding the phone up in the air . I make out the basement sounds of boiler pipes clanking and the throb of music from the club above . She pulls the phone back to her mouth . " Eddie 's still onstage . Which you know . Which I know you know . " Her name is Angelica and she owns the Double Wide , where Eddie and his band often gig . She 's ofthat leathery tribe of original punk rockers who preserve a minute but pure fraction of their scene in places like New York , L.A. , and London . The roots of her white blond hair are salt-and-pepper ; her tattoos have become abstract with time . Like many of the survivors , she 's in some program-NA , Rational Recovery-which is why her husband Jimbo handles the drinking part of the bar . She 'll sleep downstairs while the bands play , and then wake at five or so to mop beer , count the till , do paperwork . I know what I seem like to a woman like that , who sleeps below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough , she 'll eventually pull on her jeans , climb the stairs , and wave at Eddie in a pause between songs . She 's tough , Angelica , but she knows what it 's like to wait home . Of course by the time Eddie picks up the phone , I 'm breathing fine again . He agrees this does n't necessarily mean it 's psychological . I 've gotten some pretty serious diagnoses over the years . Doctors have variously suggested asthma , a spore from inhaling bird shit , or emphysema . My current theory : It has something to do with my lying down . The episodes only occur at night , a weight that settles on my chest . I 've read that rogue tissue will sometimes grow close to the organs to unpredictable effect . Not for the first time , I tell this theory to Eddie . " But for now , I mean ? You 're OK ? The guys are-we 're in the middle of a set . " In his voice I hear the studied forbearance , the muted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , I imagine , it would only be for them that he would brave the resentment of his bandmates , risk losing the small audience he has . But , as in all relationships , we 've made our bargains and patience is Eddie 's end . Of course I worry about whether I do my part-if there 's some imbalance , if I am accumulating secret debt that will exact its price in suffering . Nights like these , I mean . I worry . But mostly I 'm convinced I make a fair contribution . Above Eddie , in a club the size of a nice public restroom , there are a handful of men the age of young grandfathers and a couple of twenty-year-old girlfriends . The men are the same ones from the last gig . They 're all musicians , all play in the bars just like the Double Wide where Eddie goes on nights off . The girls are never familiar . They are always being traded for others young enough to be impressed by knife scars and a little basic knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches the kids on MTV , the next generation of rockers miming his guitar riffs and trademark sneer . Crushing Defeat , Eddie 's band in the seventies , had been a musicians " band , and his influence , via bigger names , is everywhere these days . The way he sees it , it 's just a matter of time before ( as happened between sixties rock " n " rollers and the great blues legends that preceded them ) Eddie gets rediscovered . He jokes about how he wo n't bother with compunctions or artistic integrity this time around , how he 'll eat and shit corporate pabulum , as long as they sign the checks . He 's an incurable optimist that way . It 's been my job , for the past ten years , to believe in him with him . His triumphant return ! Just around the corner ! Of course it is ! But late at night when my lungs ache , it 's hard to see how it 's important for him to finish the third set for the same old crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . " Go ahead , baby . It 's OK . " " It 's not , " he says . " I can tell it 's not . " I shrug into the phone , and we know each other so well , have known each other so long that he hears the gesture . " Half an hour , baby , " he tells me . The girls , even now , go wild for that voice . On the dot . Set your clock . " Set my clock , indeed . Fifty-five minutes later he arrives home and curls his wind-whipped body against mine . There is the muffled smell of the city in winter , the faint tang of his boozy sweat , and I breathe easy . I 've heard Eddie lie to his friends about the clothes I buy for him , say they 're knockoffs or were gotten secondhand . Which is fine . I try to be sensitive . For example , I 'm careful to buy things that fit his look , to update only gradually . Designers make military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , without my asking , he 's dressing up for me . He emerges from the bathroom still steamy from his shower , selects a mod-looking suit , his Beatle boots , rubs a fingerful of wax into his unruly hair . He 's not always so cooperative . He 's not ( even though we joke about it ) my kept man . I pay the rent , sure , get the check when we eat somewhere nice , but he has his work . The band is serious , certainly puts in more hours a week than the socalled professional artists I represent . Eddie brings in some money . He 'll do light construction for friends buying lofts , give high-priced guitar lessons to teenagers who 've stumbled across Crushing Defeat ; and of course , there 's always the door from the Double Wide . It 's enough . We both get uncomfortable if I have to supply his spending cash . It 's been , I guess , a year since I stopped going to his gigs . I just ca n't stay up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let him off the hook as far as my openings go . It is n't that he does n't like art-he 's more knowledgeable than many of my collector clients about the New York scene-but the crowd does n't fit Eddie 's idea of a good night out . I 'm with him , honestly , but it 's how I make my living , and there are times when I need a date . Eddie has this savant ability with a certain kind of man . I do n't know : There 's a little something of the ex-con in him , big fists and arms , which coupled with his gentle voice tend to seduce small , powerful men . And women , obviously-how he won me in the first place . The husband of Marisol Bell , one of my newer artists , is the right sort for Eddie 's charm . Lately Don Bell has been giving me trouble . He 'll complain about my commission , which is completely standard , and about her sales , which are , I 'll admit , pretty poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't told him , but I have my eye on a vintage Gibson for him if this all works out . " Eddie , come on . " I push his hand away . The cars ahead dodge in and out of lane in momentary synchronicity , as if they 're making some kind of big conceptual braid . Which just proves I 'm in show mode , readying with my snake oil of art criticism and elixir of theory . Meanwhile , Eddie is sliding his fingers up my skirt . " Seriously . Stop it , " I tell him , but my smile is n't serious at all . That 's the way it goes . Something about the sensation of his calloused fingertips on my tender parts still feels as dangerous as ten years ago , as when he was married and I was a twenty-five-year-old girl , as when we both called ourselves " artists . " We 're thirty minutes early , but there are already disasters at the gallery . Eddie gives me his rock star smile , nods toward a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's never been to college , but he collects words and facts like pocket change . Still , occasionally , he 'll mispronounce something-Dada with a nasal a , libretto with the same accent as in library-and it 'll break me open . The shock of it , this big smart man chewing European languages like a mouthful of rocks . I rarely make mistakes about my artists , but I admit that in the case of Marisol Bell , I might have been dazzled by expensive production and some art school legerdemain . She calls herself an " elemental artist , " though she was a chemist first . First is a hard thing to imagine in one so young , and I now suspect this means an undergraduate minor and an internship . What she makes are glass boxes and bottles that appear to contain colored gasses frozen midosmosis . She 'd won a competition , and sciencey things had been showing well in rival galleries . Visually her work bored me from the start , but I 'd thought I could sell the concept . Water would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned me . That 's the height of arrogance , he said , to think that your taste is so rarefied that things you dislike are more likely to appeal to the masses . And he 'd been right . I put her into a group show and got enough interest to draw a midlevel critic . He even brought a professor friend to help him figure out Marisol 's methodology . But that had been the problem . There was n't any . According to the chemist , Marisol 's elemental art was illusion . I already had the solo show lined up by the time the article came out , but I had not yet settled on a guest list . Understand , I have relationships with collectors . They rely on my taste . It would have been unwise , given the publicity , for me to spend too much capital on an event like Marisol 's opening . So this is an evening for newer or perhaps less-serious collectors . For people who want art to match their decor . It is about trying to recoup losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back agitating about why she does n't have a museum show yet Thus , Eddie . By the time I hunt down the missing case of white wine , find a place for the seahorse wisp in a cube , the first guests are filtering in . It 's another three-quarters of an hour before I have a pause for Eddie , who I imagine slugging wine , sullenly eyeing the crowd , my perpetual bad-boy prom date . But his corner is empty , the crossword folded on a chair , and Eddie has drifted into conversation . " Wonderful , " I say . " I 'm so glad you two have met . " Marisol Bell wheels on me in such a way that I think she 's angry . " You 're married to Eddie Bright ? How could you not tell me ? " " We 're not married , " Eddie says . " Sorry , " says the artist . " I 'm always doing that . God- " She shakes her head at herself , then continues scolding . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no idea Eddie was still playing . I had no idea he was your partner . " To me , Crushing Defeat has never been anything . I was in Boston , listening to The Cars and Adam Ant , in the year or so one could call Crushing Defeats heyday ; but Eddie and I will occasionally meet people who 'd heard them on college radio or on some New York stations way back when . Marisol , though , is from Arizona , the wrong demographic by ten years . Of course there are always oddball music junkies , denizens of indie record stores , who 've dug Eddie up one way or another , and I suppose Marisol must be one of those . " Eddie Bright , " she says again . " What label are you with now ? " Eddie shrugs . " We have our own label . We represent a few bands , had a kind of local hit with the Double Wide collection . " Eddie 's " local hit " meant they 'd sold about five hundred copies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our bargain holds even when he 's talking to a pretty girl . " Fantastic , " Marisol says . " Do you ever-I mean , this is probably totally presumptuous-but would you ever play a private gig ? " Eddie shrugs . " I would n't say it 's impossible . " " ' Cause , God , I feel like my work could have an incredible conversation with your music . I mean , would n't that be an event ? " For perhaps the same reason I 'm uncomfortable at this moment , the husband suddenly appears at Marisol 's shoulder . He 's quite a bit older than she is , which is a familiar story , the way a lot of pretty young artists get the time to develop their talent . Oh , Don ! " she says . " Its Eddie Bright . " Don offers his hand , cocks his eyebrow . " Do we know each other ? " Eddie laughs his big , warm laugh . " I would n't expect so . Your wife remembers my little band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I mean by Eddie 's genius , that your wife , having seen immediately that the guy was nervous , reassuring him . Eddies intuitive when he wants to be , has a natural ability to flatter . Eddie looks at this guy Don 's high-end jeans , the brand of the sunglasses sticking out of his shirt pocket , and thinks : corporate . Thinks : but married to a sculptor . And so Eddie asks , " You 're also an artist ? " " Hardly , " says Don . " Just an art lover . " He slips his arm around Marisol , makes a gesture which is almost certainly a possessive slap on the ass . At her first solo show . And Eddie , my Eddie , laughs with Don at his stupid joke . Art lover . Good one . Then , OK , something else happens . I see Eddie 's eyes flick up to the banner with Marisol 's name , make some connection . When he turns back , he 's almost sparkling , as if , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped onstage . I do n't know what he 's seen , exactly , what he 's noticed , but my peevish lover has suddenly turned on Eddie Bright , Rock Star . It 's this thing in his hips , in his eyes , in the slight slack of his lips . It 's always worked on me . But I 'm not his audience , nor , to my surprise , is Marisol Bell . " What did you say you did again , Don ? " Eddie is glowing with testosterone , with genius and tragedy , with whatever makes lame boy wolves show their bellies to their pack leaders . And Don Bell ? Don Bell is considering his manicure . Don Bell could give a shit about Eddie Bright . " Yeah , " says Don . " Yeah , so , anyway . Bunny . You 've got a minute for me , do n't you ? " I cast Eddie the secret sign for save me , but his instincts are gummed with stardust . " Do n't worry about me , " Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Don take my elbow , to steer me in the direction of the crudits . Don Bell , Don Bell tells me , has a few concerns . Or , he says , call them suggestions . He 's been working the crowd , and he does n't recognize anyone 's name . I get Don as the kind of guy who would study up for his wife 's profession , read the right magazines , develop a file on his Palm . Don is the sort of guy who likes to be an expert on everything . " You have a reputation , " he is saying . " We 've been told you could deliver the big guns . What about the Rappaports , for example ? Do n't they collect newer artists ? " I laugh in a way I hope is somewhere between polite and amused . " They collect twentieth century , if that 's what you mean . But you don't-Don-you do not begin with Rappaports . " Don nods , but he 's not an idiot . He 'd read that art critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't want to second-guess you or anything . It 's just ... I mean , I do n't want Marisol disappointed . " I look him in the eye , which is my best tactic for people like Don , who is used to being people 's boss . Honey , I want to tell him , I 've dealt with people who would sprinkle your stock options on their breakfast cereal . " You 're a businessman , Don . You can see the point of smaller-scale clients , of letting the buzz build . " " If there were something she could do . A different direction she could explore . " He sees my face , and his hardens . " Or something I could do . A space I could rent , or , you know , my business contacts . " " I 'll let you know , Don . But it's-it tends to be more organic than that . " There 's a part of me that enjoys a conversation like this , an even match . My work may have a genteel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not every day I encounter an equal in the oilier aspects of my craft . Don gives me a bit of a smile-collusion , perhaps respect from a well-matched sparring partner-and I smile back . Nothings going to be settled tonight . Now we shift away from each other . We find our lovers across the room , between a smog-orange bit of mist and a green sheet of fog . Marisol 's champagne flute is tilted dangerously in her hand , spraying little droplets as she laughs at Eddie 's joke . Don and I , at the same moment , step forward to catch that glass . A curious fact about the creature who visits at night ( kneels on my chest , blocks my air ) : She never comes when Eddie is with me . I think it 's because I sleep on my side to accommodate him . Even though as my business has improved , we 've gradually upgraded from our ten-years-ago furniture-my student stuff , the castoffs from his wrecked marriage-we 're still sleeping in my old double bed . Eddie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with all sorts of extravagant things : cherry sleigh beds , NASA-approved mattresses , eiderdown and pillowtops ; but we never quite have . And so we 're always a little crowded . Still , there 's enough room tonight for him to draw away when I try to touch him . He has a bad back , and sometimes my arm beneath his body or my head on his pillow can aggravate the pain . But it 's not the back this time . " What ? " I ask . " You seemed to have an OK time . " " Sure , " he says . " It was n't bad . " " You know I 'd never bring you unless I needed you , baby . " I place my hand once more against his skin . I feel his muscles harden beneath my touch , but if that 's a sign of discomfort , he 's out of luck . His body is flush with the edge of the mattress . " That guy , Don Bell , " Eddie says after a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , perhaps , be expecting this , but I 'm not and I inhale with surprise . A mistake . Eddie is sensitive to the signs of lying . " Let 's see , " I say . " Marisol told me it was something with music . Or entertainment law ? Anyway , a parasite of some kind . Like me . " Eddie usually responds to my self-denigration , since it implies good things about him . But again , not this time . " About six months ago ? " His voice is hard , even . Eddie 's anger manifests as a lack of affect , as going cold . " When we were at that huge Creepers/Dolls show . I pointed out that security guy , in front of us at the latrines , the spiral logo on his back . I told you-and this I remember-that was the logo for Don Bell 's company . That the show must be one of his productions . " He speaks away from me , without turning . " Baby . " I place my other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Baby . Hey , I 'm sorry , baby . I guess it 's a pretty important thing to forget . " But . But " forgetting " is n't precisely what I 'd done . More like , filed away the memory with other difficult or inconvenient information . Now , it slots into place : the pungent smell of chemical toilets , the scuffed grass of every outdoor venue , the red-eyed kids peeling bills off their fat wads of cash . I had already met Don Bell then ; remember now that his name , when Eddie spoke it , had been familiar enough . This just proves it , Eddie had said . Onstage the geezer punk rock Dolls were lifting their veiny arms to thousands of screaming adolescents . Once upon a time the Dolls might have been called a knockoff Crushing Defeat , might just have merited that compliment . A whole other generation , Eddie had said . The children were buying amulets , drugs , bootlegs , posters . They were buying the teenaged Creepers with their sweetly pierced tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what moved him , what he was reminding me of now , was that because of Don Bell , those kids were also buying the Dolls . Now dozens of possibilities , easy things and hard , slip between Eddie and me , microthin but real . Things I could have done , things I could still do , on the strength of my acquaintance with Don Bell . I make no offers . Eddie is silent . I listen to his breath , measured and shallow , but it tells me nothing . He could have forgiven me ; he could be sleeping ; he might be glaring still into the space beyond our bed . Which is not how it 's supposed to be . I can read Eddie . I can hear his anger in a sibilant plural , read his loneliness in the angle of his spine . We can read each other . And so , whatever we look like to the rest of the world , alone , in bed , we have always been a perfect match . The air thins ; my chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standard practice in adultery to avoid mention of the betrayed spouse , but I had n't been interested in etiquette . I 'd wanted to know everything about Eddie 's wife . I 'd wanted to hear about the tantrums , the drunken striptease , the places she called him from at dawn . Eddie made the gentleman 's effort to protect her , to keep her from our bed ; but in his own way he 'd been as desperate to tell as I 'd been to hear , and he gave me what I wanted . He could have survived , he told me . Even for the sake of something as fragile as love , and as vague as the idea of marriage , he would have lived through the blackouts , stanched the nosebleeds , salved the inexplicable bruises . He could have borne it all , if only he could have been prepared . And for a while this was possible . She was a deliberate addict , limited her binges to Friday nights , and then only when they had money . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added Saturdays , and then the occasional holiday . And so on . Soon there was no in-between . By the time he met me , her moods lifted and touched down like tornadoes . Daylight . Wednesdays . In the middle of a matinee . Back then , when Eddie and I were new lovers , I 'd simply wanted to hear ugly words about my rival in the mouth of her man . It is only now , much later , that I understand what Eddie was trying to say about predicting . My night visitor , like Eddies wife , began with a routine . But she has broken her own rules . She came to me with Eddie at my side . It seems so terribly unfair . In the days since that attack , every moment has been potentially treacherous . There is no time when I can be certain she will not come . I wait . Entering an empty elevator , I imagine myself arriving at my floor slumped and lifeless . Or in the shower , collapsed , the water long gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wary . The next ambush comes on a sunlit Monday afternoon . I have been taking advantage of Eddie 's absence-he and the boys are rehearsing in their studio-to tidy his practice room . I renovated this space for him , as a birthday present , about two years ago . I hoped the working telephone , stocked fridge , and reliable heat would woo them from their drafty loft . But they must like the feel of roughing it or the isolation of being unreachable . They never come . Still , Eddie will write in here , practice a few hours a week , and these sessions leave evidence , little scrolls of LifeSaver wrappers , fine hairs , balled tissues . In theory , I do n't come in this room . In theory , I respect his privacy . But when we run out of mugs or glassware in the kitchen , I feel it gives me permission to excavate . Here is a coffee cup lined with felty green mold . Here , a pen leaking ink onto sheet music . Here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason-I am collapsing , clutching at myself like some bad melodrama of heart attack . It 's got me . And this time , there is no way to call Eddie . How do you judge a lie you tell yourself ? Is it the same sin as a lie you tell someone else ? As a child , I was paddled with equal vigor for actual falsehood as for things withheld . Then , the punishment had seemed unjust . Often I protested that I had not even known there was a thing to confess . Now , of course , I see that there are layers of not telling , a spectrum between secrecy and self-delusion . The poles may not be equivalent , but there is a point between that represents a kind of ignorance so deliberate , so enormous , its consequences may be more pronounced than those of its intentional neighbor . Which is to say , I know it is n't asthma that makes my breath seem to cease . It is n't a dust allergy or histoplasmosis . In fact , it 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a fourth or fifth visit to his office , put it to me bluntly : If my breathing really had stopped as many times as I had symptoms , I would have died or been brain damaged years ago . I did not share his observation with Eddie . But I am not not a complete charlatan . I have sensations that are just as I 've described to the EMTs and nurses . In the moment , I believe myself completely . I do not remember driving to Eddies studio , the complex process of getting the car from the garage , of entering the code to lift the gate . I do not remember navigating the crazy dogleg turn that divides the two neighborhoods . Later I will remember only one moment of the trip : the dry , papery sound of my breath , a pigeon floating past my windshield . The postcard I picked up in Eddie 's practice room , the one that stopped my breath , was quite like any of the dozens of others that arrive in our mailbox each month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side depicts the artist 's best work , and on the reverse are the details of the event . There was nothing odd about finding such a thing in Eddie 's space . Even its placement , beneath his sheet music , need not necessarily have indicated duplicity . But Marisol s Kermit-green wisp on the front , and her phone number , her handwriting , on the back , made all the possibly innocuous explanations melt in that moment . Now , parked near the band 's warehouse space , I contemplate the postcard with quieter breath . I measure Eddie 's big thumbprints , note how they have smeared Marisol 's ink . I consider how the glossy surface has wrinkled , how its corners are bent , as if it has been carried in a pocket close to the skin . Now that I think of it , it is easy to call up the image of Marisol at her show : She shakes her bracelets down her arm , leans forward to make a desk of the gallery wall , licks the tip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile as he takes the card from her hand . Yes , he 's saying , sure . I 'd love the chance to work with you . Honestly I can not say if I recall this , having watched with a dumb grin over the rim of my wineglass , or only imagine it . Regardless , much seems obvious to me now : the fact that Eddie 's studio is mere blocks from Marisol 's , how free and unaccounted for are their hours here . Nothing would have been simpler . I find the studio with Crushing Defeat 's logo , and slide the key in the lock . I open the door . The room has the hushed emptiness of settling dust , of indirect light angling grayly into a vast space . Neither Eddie nor the band has been near here today . I have to check the address of Marisol 's studio . She rents-or Don Bell rents for hera loading dock with a great metal gate she keeps raised in the summer . I have been there a few times , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as possible . It keeps the terms of the relationship clear . There is the smell of yeast in the air . A few small bakeries still operate out of these buildings , though increasingly even artists do n't work here anymore . Many of the warehouses have views of the water , and all have high ceilings and wide wooden floorboards . These days the upper units are selling for two million five . Soon I will move my office here , perhaps my apartment , but I am waiting until the gutters no longer glisten with broken windshield glass , until it is more completely transformed . The gate at Marisol 's is pulled open high enough for a tall man to walk beneath . The space is vast , crowded with heavy metal shelves , found objects , the fruit of an impressive productivity . I recognize a few pieces-unsold sculptures from the show-but I can also see she is experimenting . The newer stuff is familiar-puffs , clouds , wisps-but these versions are constructed from different materials . Liquid , it looks like , fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly strike me . To make the substance look insubstantial is quite a trick-yet a trick just the same . I sense movement on the loading dock above and go still . I have prepared nothing to say , no showdown speech . Fingers seem to tighten around my throat-but they release . I am safe . The person approaching me is only Don Bell . He smiles , and though the smile is the same oiled mechanism I 've encountered before , there 's something lesser about it-as if it , too , has been reconstructed in an unfamiliar material . I watch the points of his shoes descend . " No one 's here , " he says . " Marisol , I mean . She is n't here . " " You are , " I say , " which is fortunate . I 've been meaning to talk to you . I think there are things we could talk about . " " Sure , " says Don Bell . " If you look at it a certain way , we have a lot in common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " So much , really , in human commerce turns out to be negotiable . Don Bell has been developing this second-stage concept for festivals , has been looking for really talented musicians to fill the spots . " Kids are so sophisticated these days . They 're so resistant to marketing . I need to find the genuine article . Something totally noncommercial , something with the raw talent to win over a first-time audience , " says Don Bell . Odd , I tell him , since the second-stage concept is so much like one I 've been toying with : a series of joint shows of established artists and a few up-and-comers who have been directly influenced by them . My clients , like his teenagers , love to have the feeling they 've discovered something . " I was thinking I 'd begin with environmental art , " I say . Between professionals like us , few further words are required to get things settled . Things settle . An understanding is established . Eddie and his boys will join Don 's summer tour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marisol will appear on a new postcard . You could call them bribes , what we are offering our lovers , but they 're good ones . Hearts-desire good . Neither Don nor I doubts that it 's enough to get precisely what we want in return . On the car ride home I start to plan how I 'll put the idea to Eddie . As with the new suits and dress shirts I give him , delicacy is called for . But I am also a believer in self-interest . Eddie will find a way to accept my gift , to understand its terms . Soon , though , I 'm thinking of other , more pleasant things . I 'm thinking of the summer , the months when he 'll be on the road . I will save considerable money by his absence . There are groceries I wo n't buy , dinners out , too , and cash I wo n't secretly slip into his wallet . It will be enough , perhaps , to top off my apartment fund . More : There will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe I have earned . I will make certain there are windows in the bedroom , and I will finally buy myself a decent , adult mattress . Maybe I 'll fly out to wherever he is to tell him that I am moving . Spend the night in a good hotel , somewhere in western cattle country . Maybe I 'll just do it over the phone . Either way , on what Don pays him , Eddie will have banked enough by the time he returns to make it on his own . It 's not that I do n't love Eddie . It 's just that there are things I want that I ca n't have with him . And I have come to owe him too much to leave for something as slight as my own pleasure . But now there 's this , a cause for my effect . Now it has almost been done for me . We have known each other so long , Eddie and I , we have lived so close , that we speak without speaking . He hears my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flattened palm . I open the door , and he looks up . He knows what I have come to say , and I steel myself for the excuses that will embarrass us both , the pointless recriminations . But this is something else . It must be some trick of the light from the airshaft , some way defeat blossoms in him , or the simple exhaustion of having two women . Because he looks to me suddenly like his future unfolded , like the story of how he will become old . I see as if it is happening now the way arthritis will twist his fingers , the way his knees will give , the way his lungs will start to heave . How inevitably he will lose his music . He stands now , but his spine can not quite straighten , his hands do not entirely unbend . Already too old for the crowds at the outdoor shows .

This is who you will have to leave . Author Affiliation MELANIE CONROY-GOLDMAN is an assistant professor of English at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Maine .
