This will be a good weekend for reading . I picked up a dozen of Vernie Crabtree 's killer chocolate chip cookies at the French Club bake sale yesterday . ( I do n't know what she puts in them , but they 're chewy and crispy at the same time . ) Those , a pot of coffee , and a good book are all I will need for the rainy weekend rolling in . It 's early September in our mountains , so it 's warm during the day , but tonight will bring a cool mist to remind us that fall is right around the corner . The Wise County Bookmobile is the one of the most beautiful sights in the world to me . When I see it lumbering down the mountain road like a tank , then turning wide and easing onto Shawnee Avenue , I flag it down like an old friend . I 've waited on this corner every Friday since I can remember . The Bookmobile is just a government truck , but to me it 's a glittering royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even love the smell of books . People have often told me that one of their strongest childhood memories is the scent of their grandmother 's house . I never knew my grandmothers , but I could always count on the Bookmobile . The most important thing I ever learned , I learned from books . Books have taught me how to size people up . The most useful book I ever read taught me how to read faces , an ancient Chinese art called siang mien , in which the size of the eyes , curve of the lip , and height of the forehead are important clues to a person 's character . The placement of ears indicates intelligence . Chins that stick out reflect stubbornness . Deep-set eyes suggest a secretive nature . Eyebrows that grow together may answer the question Could that man kill me with his bare hands ? ( He could . ) Even dimples have meaning . I have them , and according to face reading , something wonderful is supposed to happen to me when I turn thirty-five . ( It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . ) If you were to read my face , you would find me a comfortable person with brown eyes , good teeth , nice lips , and a nose that folks , when they are being kind , refer to as noble . It 's a large nose , but at least it 's straight . My eyebrows are thick , which indicates a practical nature . ( I 'm a pharmacisthow much more practical can you get ? ) I have a womanly shape , known around here as a mountain girl 's body , strong legs , and a flat behind . Jackets cover it quite nicely . This morning the idea of living in Big Stone Gap for the rest of my life gives me a nervous feeling . I stop breathing , as I do whenever I think too hard . Not breathing is very bad for you , so I inhale slowly and deeply . I taste coal dust . I do n't mind ; it assures me that we still have an economy . Our town was supposed to become the " Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia . " That never happened , so we are forever at the whims of the big coal companies . When they tell us the coal is running out in these mountains , who are we to doubt them ? It 's pretty here . Around six o'clock at night everything turns a rich Crayola midnight blue . You will never smell greenery so pungent . The Gap definitely has its romantic qualities . Even the train whistles are musical , sweet oboes in the dark . The place can fill you with longing . The Bookmobile is at the stoplight . The librarian and driver is a good-time gal named Iva Lou Wade . She 's in her forties , but she 's yet to place the flag on her sexual peak . She 's got being a woman down . If you painted her , she 'd be sitting on a pink cloud with gold-leaf edges , showing a lot of leg . Her perfume is so loud that when I visit the Bookmobile , I wind up smelling like her for the bulk of the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emeraude . ) My father used to say that that 's how a woman ought to be . " A man should know when there 's a woman in the room . When Iva Lou comes in , there ai n't no doubt . " I 'd just say nothing and roll my eyes . Iva Lou 's having a tough time parking . A mail truck has parked funny in front of the post office , taking up her usual spot , so she motions to me that she 's pulling into the gas station . That 's fine with the owner , Kent Vanhook . He likes Iva Lou a lot . What man does n't ? She pays real nice attention to each and every one . She examines men like eggs , perfect specimens created by God to nourish . And she has n't met a man yet who does n't appreciate it . Luring a man is a true talent , like playing the piano by ear . Not all of us are born prodigies , but women like Iva Lou have made it an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't believe what Iva Lou 's wearing : Her ice-blue turtleneck is so tight it looks like she 's wearing her bra on the outside . Her Mondrian-patterned pants , with squares of pale blue , yellow , and green , cling to her thighs like crisscross ribbons . Even sitting , Iva Lou has an unbelievable shape . But I wonder how much of it has to do with all the cinching . Could it be that her parts are so well-hoisted and suspended , she has transformed her real figure into a soft hourglass ? Her face is childlike , with a small chin , big blue eyes , and a rosebud mouth . Her eyeteeth snaggle out over her front teeth , but on her they 're demure . Her blond hair is like yellow Easter straw , arranged in an upsweep you can see through the set curls . She wears lots of Sarah Coventry jewelry , because she sells it on the side . " I 'll trade you . Shampoo for a best-seller . " I give Iva Lou a sack of shampoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You got a deal . " Iva Lou grabs the sack and starts sorting through the samples . She indicates the shelf of new arrivals . " Ave Maria , honey , you have got to read The Captains and the Kings that just came out . I know you do n't like historicals , but this one 's got sex . " " How much more romance can you handle , Iva Lou ? You 've got half the men in Big Stone Gap tied up in knots . " She snickers . " Half ? Oh well , I'm-a gon na take that as a compliment-o anyway . " I 'm half Italian , so Iva Lou insists on ending her words with vowels . I taught her some key phrases in Italian in case international romance was to present itself . It was n't very funny when Iva Lou tried them out on my mother one day . I sure got in some Big Trouble over that . Iva Lou has a goal . She wants to make love to an Italian man , so she can decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eye-talian men are my Matta-horn , honey , " she declares . Too bad there are n't any in these parts . The people around here are mainly Scotch-Irish , or Melungeon ( folks who are a mix of Turkish , French , African , Indian , and who knows what ; they live up in the mountain hollers and stick to themselves ) . Zackie Wakin , owner of the town department store , is Lebanese . My mother and I were the only Italians ; and then about five years ago we acquired one Jew , Lewis Eisenberg , a lawyer from Woodbury , New York . " You always sit in the third snap stool . How come ? " Iva Lou asks , not looking up as she flips through a new coffee-table book about travel photography . " I like threes . " " Sweetie-o , let me tell you something . " Iva Lou gets a faraway , mystical twinkle in her eye . Then her voice lowers to a throaty , sexy register . " When I get to blow this coal yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell wo n't waste my time taking pictures of the Circus Maximus . I am not interested in rocks ' n ' ruins . I want to experience me some flesh and blood . Some magnificent , broad-shouldered hunk of a European man . Forget the points of interest , point me toward the men . Marble do n't hug back , baby . " Then she breathes deeply , " Whoo . " Iva Lou fixes herself a cup of Sanka and laughs . She 's one of those people who are forever cracking themselves up . She always offers me a cup , and I always decline . I know that her one spare clean Styrofoam cup could be her entree to a romantic rendezvous . Why waste it on me ? " I found you that book on wills you wanted . And here 's the only one I could find on grief . " Iva Lou holds up As Grief Exits as though she 's modeling it . The pretty cover has rococo cherubs and clouds on it . The angels ' smiles are instantly comforting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Iva Lou 's face . Her innocent expression is just like the cherub 's . She really wants to know how I am . My mother died on August 2 , 1978 , exactly one month ago today . It was the worst day of my life . She had breast cancer . I never thought cancer would get both of my parents , but it did . Mama was fifty-two years old , which suddenly seems awfully young to me . She was only seventeen when she came to America . My father taught her English , but she always spoke with a thick accent . One of the things I miss most about her is the sound of her voice . Sometimes when I close my eyes I can hear her .
