<p> Bears fans ought to keep an eye on what 's happening in Philadelphia , where the rocky relationship between Donovan McNabb and media and fans coupled with Andy Reid 's personal problems might create an opportunity for the Bears in the offseason . Assuming , of course , the Bears are in the market for a starting quarterback . <p> McNabb is n't what he once was  --  an elite NFL quarterback . But he would be as good as anyone the Bears have had at the position for decades . Even if he was just a stopgap player at the position , as one NFL executive suggested this week , he would be at least as good as Steve McNair was for Baltimore last season , with the possibility of getting significantly better a year removed from knee surgery . <p> The big question , of course , is whether McNabb , a former Mount Carmel High School star whose family remains in the south suburbs , would want to come to the Bears . A source close to McNabb said earlier this year that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bears did n't have a lot to offer on offense . The offensive line is aging . They do n't have a top- flight running back . And other than at tight end , the receiving corps  --  wide receivers and backs  --  would need a major upgrade to attract a front-line quarterback . <p> It 's a harsh assessment , and one many people have n't considered . But there are two things the Bears could offer McNabb : a chance to come home and a chance to get out of Philadelphia . The Eagles have been as bad as the Bears in the first half of the season and as big a disappointment to their fans . McNabb , who was booed on draft day by fans , has taken the brunt of the blame for a 3-5 start . <p> Many are clamoring for rookie Kevin Kolb , the Eagles ' surprise first pick who increased the schism between the team and McNabb , who obviously would 've preferred weapons to help him , not replace him . <p> " It 's easy to blame the quarterback when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole reason why we lost these games , " McNabb told reporters in a news conference Wednesday . " I can definitely help , yes , I can . But I should n't get blamed for everything that goes on around here . " <p> McNabb has learned to take criticism in Philadelphia and insists he 's not going to allow it to deter him from the goal at hand  --  even if the backup is more popular than the starter . <p> " If people continue to talk about it , if they feel like it 's helping them vent and get some stuff off their chest , that 's great , " he said . " But when I 'm in this building , I 'm prepared to be the guy who can go out there and help us win games . " <p> Reid has plenty of distractions to deal with himself now that his sons , Britt and Garrett , have been arrested on weapons and drug charges and caused a lot of public embarrassment to their family . Garrett , in particular , apparently has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time around the Eagles ' facility . <p> There was even a ridiculous Internet report this week that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has upset some league personnel by not coming down hard on Reid after a judge called his house " a drug emporium . " The idea was that the commissioner has lorded over players with an iron fist and would n't have forgiven one if a friend or family member had brought drugs to the home . <p> It 's missing the point , completely , of course . Who knows what action Goodell has taken ? The personal- conduct policy instituted in the off-season is designed to punish multiple offenders , not guys who might be accused of bad parenting . <p> Regardless , all the piling on might drive Reid from his job , although he has insisted he 's not going anywhere . Clearly , he remains a great McNabb supporter , and his departure could spell the end for the veteran player . <p> EX FACTOR <p> TANK JOHNSON <p> Dallas Cowboys DT <p> The former Bears defensive tackle , who spent two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut after an early morning traffic stop in Arizona mere hours after the end of the team 's minicamp , will finally line up for the Cowboys today against the Giants . He was suspended by the NFL for the first eight games of the season . Johnson is expected to play about a quarter , mostly on first and second downs . He will split time with nose tackle Jay Ratliff and is projected as an eventual starter . Remi Ayodele will be inactive with Johnson in the lineup . <p> BIG NUMBER <p> 3 The rank of Brian Urlacher 's No. 54 Bears jersey among the top 10 in sales this year , according to figures released by Reebok , the official supplier of NFL jerseys . San Diego 's LaDainian Tomlinson and New Orleans ' Reggie Bush are the only players who rank ahead of Urlacher . Peyton Manning and Brett Favre fill out the top five , and Tom Brady is No. 8 . <p> THE LAST WORD <p> " I feel like I 've been playing with one flat tire since the first game . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to get it fixed at some point , but I do n't think that 'll be during the season . I 've just got to keep playing with the pain . " <p> Ahman Green , Texans running back , who has battled knee problems <p> HOT READS <p> Just win one , baby <p> The Bears are n't the only team looking to reboot their season after a bye week . The winless Rams say they 're looking for a new start in the second half after failing to get a victory in their first eight games . And to think some so-called experts thought the Rams would be a playoff team . No NFL team has gone 0-16 , but the Buccaneers lost 14 in 1976 before the schedule was expanded . <p> " You do n't want to have a season with no wins ; that 's unthinkable , " wide receiver Brandon Williams told reporters in St. Louis . " That 's only been done one time , and we do n't want to be the second team to do it . That 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team has been crippled by injuries , said self-scouting and evaluating where things went wrong was a pointless exercise in the bye week . Instead , he has preached throwing out the first half of the season and not looking back . <p> " Everybody definitely has a new focus , and it has to be the only way we look at it , " Linehan said . <p> Crime blotter <p> Do n't look now , but Jacksonville has replaced Cincinnati and Chicago as the new trouble spot in the NFL . Offensive lineman Richard Collier and linebacker Justin Durant were arrested eight days ago in the wee hours of Saturday morning after allegedly falling asleep drunk in their cars . Collier was in a McDonald 's drive-through , and Durant pulled over on a highway exit ramp . Both were suspended two games . <p> The team also fined offensive lineman Khalif Barnes for being late to work on Saturday morning . Barnes got in trouble a couple of weeks ago when he crashed his car into a tree at 6:30 on a Saturday morning , even though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive . The Jags also lost Marcus Stroud to a four-game suspension for violating the league policy on steroids and related substances . <p> Rare McNair <p> Ravens quarterback Steve McNair is a quiet , unassuming type not known for flashes of emotion . But he finally had enough from the Baltimore media and fans who apparently have made him a scapegoat for the offense 's failings and want Kyle Boller to start ahead of him .
