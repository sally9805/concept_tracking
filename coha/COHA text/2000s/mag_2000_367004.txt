Pop quiz . Who are more likely to be dissatisfied with the appearance of their chests , men or women ? Who is more likely to be concerned about acne , your teenage son or his sister ? And who is more likely to binge eat , your nephew or your niece ? <P> If you chose the women and girls in your life , you are right only for the last question  --  and even then , not by the margin you might expect . About 40% of Americans who go on compulsive-eating sprees are men . Thirty-eight percent of men want bigger pecs , while only 34% of women want bigger breasts . And more boys have fretted about zits than girls , going all the way back to a 1972 study . <P> A groundbreaking new book declares that these numbers , along with hundreds of other statistics and interviews the authors have compiled , mean something awful has happened to American men over the past few decades . They have become obsessed with their bodies . Authors Harrison Pope and Katharine Phillips , professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberto Olivardia , a clinical psychologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Mass. , have a catchy name to describe this obsession  --  a term that will soon be doing many reps on chat shows : the Adonis Complex . <P> The name , which refers to the gorgeous half man , half god of mythology , may be a little too ready for Oprah , but the theory behind it will start a wonderful debate . Based on original research involving more than 1,000 men over the past 15 years , the book argues that many men desperately want to look like Adonis because they constantly see the " ideal , " steroid-boosted bodies of actors and models and because their muscles are all they have over women today . In an age when women fly combat missions , the authors ask , " What can a modern boy or man do to distinguish himself as being ' masculine ' ? " <P> For years , of course , some men  --  ice skaters , body builders , George Hamilton  --  have fretted over aspects of their appearance . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half of men do n't like their overall appearance , in contrast to just 1 in 6 in 1972 . True , men typically are fatter now , but another study found that 46% of men of normal weight think about their appearance " all the time " or " frequently . " And some men  --  probably hundreds of thousands , if you extrapolate from small surveys  --  say they have passed up job and even romantic opportunities because they refuse to disrupt workouts or dine on restaurant food . In other words , an increasing number of men would rather look brawny for their girlfriends than have sex with them . <P> Consider what they 're spending . Last year American men forked over $2 billion for gym memberships  --  and another $2 billion for home exercise equipment . Men 's Health ( " Rock-hard abs in six weeks ! " it screams every other issue ) had 250,000 subscribers in 1990 ; now it has 1.6 million . In 1996 alone , men underwent some 700,000 cosmetic procedures .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
