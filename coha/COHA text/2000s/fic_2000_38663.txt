Mr. Tao had outlived his wife but that did n't bother him , he always said . In time he would catch up to her in heaven . Each day he waited calmly in his chair . The winter light moved square by square across the tile floor . On Friday afternoons when I came by he looked at me through cataracts as blue as porcelain and shrugged , as if to say , " Why do you visit me ? I have no interest in food . " <p> I do n't think he suspected why I always sat so long with him . I wanted him to eat , of course , but my other reason was a selfish one . He made me less uncomfortable than the other residents because his room never smelled . At eighty-five years , and ninety-eight pounds , he had the breath of a young man . He did not give off the odor of someone rotting from within . The air that hung about his bed and chair was clean and healthy . <p> " Not even a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midDecember . " There 's a new restaurant on Canal Street that makes the most delicious vegetarian dumplings . They 're as pure as monk 's food . " <p> " Good for the monks . " <p> None of the other Chinese residents at my church retirement home had as indifferent an appetite as Mr. Tao . It was from talking with them that I had thought up the idea for my service contribution : to supplement their meals with odds and ends from downtown . Some lived in suites with kitchens and depended on me for fresh tofu . Some craved an occasional takeout order of softshell crab . I would get their orders and hurry away . Coming back on the train with sacks of groceries , I felt necessary , even happy . <p> " Not even some green tea ? " <p> " I have everything I need . " <p> I looked around the room . On the wall hung a lunar calendar with holidays in red , donated each year by the Xidong Bank . The shelf over the table held only a bilingual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leather slippers sat another , smaller pair of purple slippers embroidered with pansies and geranium leaves . I never asked about them . <p> " I bet you could use a good meal yourself , " he said . <p> When I looked away I saw a small cross opposite his chair , nailed on the wall where you would n't notice unless the door was closed . <p> " Why do n't you answer ? " <p> " I am not an eater , " I said . " I am a cook . " <p> " Who do you cook for ? " <p> " My husband , when he lived with me : ' <p> " Where is he now ? " <p> I did not know . Three years ago , one bright , cold morning in late November , he had left the house without a word . I had just made a pot of red bean porridge ; he had left behind his emptied bowl and porcelain spoon . <p> So many meals I had made for him . When we were young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had made dumplings small as pigeon 's eggs , filled with savory juice that filled the mouth when they were bitten into . I had sliced red autumn peppers so perfectly that each piece cooked to the exact same sweetness . In later years , when he grew tired , I steamed him chicken with hambones in the clay pot I had inherited from my mother . I had stewed spareribs with cloves and ginger and fresh acacia honey . How was it possible that I could have cooked for him for so many years and never known what he wanted ? <p> Mr. Tao had shifted in his chair . " I hate food , " he said , and his voice was bitter and hungry . <p> " How can you say that ? " I asked . " You are in such good health at your age because you ate well during your life : ' <p> " I was a slave to it . " <p> His words burned angrily into the room . " Those celery hearts . That ginger pork . That broth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whole chicken breast , for flavor . The ginger sweet and fresh , sliced thin like curling paper with the knife I kept so sharp for her . The fresh egg whites swirling into ribbons . Filled with protein to keep me young . Now look at me . I am living so long because of her care . I may never see her again . " <p> He stopped talking then . I think he had forgotten I was there . In the long silence I stood up as quietly as possible and left the room . <p>
