One reason politicians seem so dorky is that other than the filibuster , there are n't any cool parliamentary procedures . But the ultimate move  --  the one that 's making Aaron Sorkin even more upset that he wo n't be writing The West Wing next season  --  is to halt a vote by hightailing it out of town and then evading the cops looking to drag you back . It 's always a ratings grabber , like when some Republicans in the U.S. Senate locked themselves in their offices to quash a vote on a campaign-finance-reform bill in 1988 , causing a sergeant at arms to carry Bob Packwood feetfirst to the Senate floor ( after determining that Lowell Weicker was too heavy ) . The stunt pulled by Democrats in the Texas legislature last week was to avoid a vote on redistricting the state to create more Republican members of Congress . <P> It started two weeks ago , when House majority whip Tom DeLay came home to Texas to stir up trouble . DeLay saw a chance to boost the Republican majority in Congress by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22-to-10 advantage . The Republicans drew some funny lines , like the ones dividing Austin into four districts , one of them connecting the capital to the border of Mexico 300 miles away . Though redistricting is usually done only after a Census , DeLay had a pretty good rationale for wanting one , since Republi-cans beat the daylights out of the Dems in Texas in the last statehouse elections yet had two fewer U.S. Reps for the state . <P> Faced with a further erosion of their party 's power , 51 of the state 's 62 Democratic lawmakers packed their toothbrushes and at least one acoustic guitar last Sunday and ran away . Without a minimum of two-thirds of the 150 legislators in their seats , a vote ca n't be held , but a house rule allows the speaker to order the arrest of members trying to thwart a quorum and force them back to their seats . So , like Jesse James heading for the Oklahoma hills to evade Texas Rangers , the Dems waited until the cover of night , then met in small groups at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tight that only the group leaders knew where they were going , the Democrats sneaked off , over the state border to the safety of Ardmore , Okla. , 300 miles away . Sure , they could have gone to Mexico , but they wanted to show they were serious . Being in Oklahoma is like self-flagellation for a Texan . <P> Only one member was nabbed by Johnny Law , outside her house . And several African-American Democrats chose to go to work , in part because the Republican plans would have created more black districts . In the end , 51 rebels checked into a Holiday Inn , where they were booked two to a room . Monday morning they went to the Denny 's attached to the hotel to work on strategy while fortifying themselves with Moons over My Hammy ( ham , cheese and scrambled-egg sandwiches ) . At 3 a.m. , the Democrats were awakened and brought down to the Holiday Inn basement , where they camped out with the media because of tornado warnings .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
