I have heard all the arguments . Graph Not Transcribed I have listened to the claims that the Greeks were playing something much like it as far back as 500 BC . I have been to Vienna to gaze at the Pieter Bruegel paintings that appear to include an impromptu game any Canadian would recognize instantly . I have studied the literary evidence that Nova Scotia 's Thomas Chandler Haliburton was writing as far back as 1810 about kids " hollerin and whoopin like mad with pleasure , " as they cuffed something that may or may not have fallen from the south end of a horse , back and forth with wooden sticks . But if you want to see where shinny hockey was truly invented , let me take you to Huntsville , Ontario , in 1957 . Let us head for Dufferin Street high on the reservoir hill where town ploughs have left a wide , flattened surface and high banks . Let it be a crisp fall day when the leaves have fallen , the days have shortened and the endless season has begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothpicks . " And let us see it still played in February when the stick blades have become so thin they could stab a cherry , as we chase the same ball , now frozen , that we chase every season but the hot summer months when we are at cottages and campsites , dreaming about getting back with our friends and hearing , once again , the one call as familiar to Canadian kids as the call of the loon is to Canadian tourists . " Caaaarrr ! " With luck , it will be Mr. Mulhern  --  or , as we all know him , " Uncle Danny , " though he has no known relatives  --  and he will guide his brown Buick so the tires straddle the stones we have piled for goal posts , with a happy wave of his hand and a nod of approval . The teams endlessly change , the sides made up using various techniques including tossing all the sticks in the centre and having one kid , eyes shut , disperse them one at a time in opposite directions , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up  --  everyone perfectly aware of who will be chosen first , and who , unfortunately , must go last .

Games are over at ten goals , and new teams instantly reassembled with the shout , " Game on ! " starting the match that will carry on until mothers grow cranky calling us in for supper . There are few rules : no slashing , no cross-checking , no " golf " shots . Don Wilston 's big German shepherd , Rick , can watch but not play . And whoever shoots the ball past Mary Street , chases it . There is one rule particular only to Dufferin Street and not likely found on any of the thousands of road hockey shrines across this country : no chasing the tennis balls into Mrs. Wieler 's raspberry patch even if , in early fall , all the raspberries have long since been picked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap an extra sugar maple each March and grants the players exclusive rights to the sap  --  God 's Gatorade  --  when spring gloriously extends games into evening play . Morley Callaghan once called hockey " our national drama , " and so we should think of road hockey as our little theatres of the game , where the first taste is developed and where drama and comedy play out on small stages from one end of the country to the other . Each version of the game has its own ethos , and yet is recognizable by all as one and the same . Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed A back street in Huntsville in the 1950s , a side street in Brandon in the 1930s , a dead-end street in Dartmouth in the 1960s  --  each has equal claim to the game that has meant more to young Canadians than any other in any form . There is a certain beauty to the many variations on pickup hockey : the opportunity to dream , to seek magic , to fail and fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years , Canada has been plagued by stories of adults seeking to outlaw this activity that one court complainant in Hamilton , Ontario , called " totally uncivilized . " It has happened in Miramichi , New Brunswick , in Nepean , Ontario , in Port Coquitlam , BC , and will happen again elsewhere before this year is out . Neighbours will complain , the police will be called and , all too often , the issue will be settled in court  --  usually , mercifully , tossed out by a judge with enough sense to realize there are better uses for the law than putting a damper on children " hollerin ' and whoopin " like mad with pleasure . " " Road hockey is part of Canada , " Don Annett , a businessman who supported a citizens ' revolt to strike down a bylaw prohibiting road hockey in Listowel , Ontario , told reporters . " If anything , I think it teaches the kids to be even more aware of traffic . " " Like fishing or golf , " Globe and Mail sports columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered not so much by officials enforcing a code of conduct , but by self-imposed etiquette . To keep playing , rather than taking your stick and going home at the first slight , requires learning how to function co-operatively with others and acknowledge a few simple rights and wrongs . " And to acknowledge as well , this proud Dufferin Street alumnus would suggest , that there is something pure and sweet about road hockey that is worth preserving by action if not by law . A game that is forever being invented is one that should go on as long as there are players wanting to play . THERE ARE FEW RULES : NO SLASHING , NO CROSS-CHECKING , NO " GOLF " SHOTS . THERE IS SOMETHING PURE &; SWEET ABOUT ROAD HOCKEY THAT IS WORTH PRESERVING . <p>
