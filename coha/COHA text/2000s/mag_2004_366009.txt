Jazz pianist Bill Charlap approaches a song the way a lover approaches his beloved . He wants to know its origins , its shape , its moods . He wants to view it from every angle  --  melody , harmony , lyrics , verse . He even wants to hear about its romantic history  --  what other improvisers have done with it . When he sits down to play , the result is an embrace , an act of possession . The tune rises , falls , disappears and resurfaces in new forms as Charlap ranges over the keyboard with nimble , crisply swinging lines , subtly layered textures , dense chords and spiky interjections . But no matter how imaginative or surprising his take on a song is , he invariably zeroes in on its essence . When he finds it , he says , " it 's like a rose coming into bloom . " <P> Charlap himself is coming into bloom these days , after years of paying his dues as a musician 's musician . His deepest ardor is for the works of classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the so-called Great American Songbook . In the annals of composition , he maintains , " these songs represent a new blueprint for a truly American style . They will always be vital and au courant , as timeless as Beethoven . " Over the past few years , with his trio mates , Peter Washington on bass and Kenny Washington ( no relation ) on drums , Charlap has built on that blueprint in a succession of beguiling and acclaimed CDs on the Blue Note label . Written in the Stars ( 2000 ) samples Porter , Gershwin , Irving Berlin and Harold Arlen , among others . Stardust ( 2003 ) , on which the trio is augmented by such guests as Tony Bennett and guitarist Jim Hall , is all Hoagy Carmichael . The best so far , this year 's Somewhere , focuses on the theater songs of Leonard Bernstein . <P> Charlap , 38 , can claim this music as a birthright . His father , who died when he was 7 , was Broadway composer Moose Charlap ( Peter Pan , Kelly ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny Goodman and co-starred on Perry Como 's 1960s TV show . In his parents ' Manhattan apartment , young Bill mingled with composers like Charles Strouse , who wrote the musical Bye Bye Birdie , and lyricists like Alan and Marilyn Bergman ( The Way We Were ) and the one he called " Uncle Yip , " E.Y . Harburg ( Somewhere Over the Rainbow , April in Paris ) . <P> He followed this immersion with a solid grounding in classical and jazz piano , then launched his career with the Gerry Mulligan Quartet and later with a quintet led by saxophonist Phil Woods , with whom he continues to make appearances today . " What struck me was his depth , " says Woods . " A lot of young players have university credentials but have lost touch with the street . They all sound the same . Not Bill . He really gets down deep into it . " <P> These days Charlap 's career is getting down deep too . When Jazz at Lincoln Center unveiled its Dizzy 's Club Coca-Cola last month , Charlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present a concert in February titled Great American Songwriters . He was also named to take over next year as artistic director of the well-regarded Jazz in July festival at Manhattan 's 92nd Street Y.
