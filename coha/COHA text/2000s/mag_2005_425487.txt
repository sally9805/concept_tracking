Before you hire a contractor or start building , read this expert advice . Photograph // In 12 years of home construction , I have never talked to anyone who had realistic expectations about building a house . We green building types usually are even worse because our goals are so high - we do nt simply want a good house , we want to transform our lives and save the planet in the process . These are wonderful aspirations . I have no desire to denigrate them , but I would like to inoculate the dream with a bit of realism while also providing tips for grabbing that dream by the horns and dragging it into the light of day . The first hard lesson is that you - and only you - are responsible for your house . You may need the help of professionals , but ultimately only you can figure out how to integrate your idiosyncratic personal needs with your exact spit of land . The point is that a good house is the symbiosis between specific people and a specific place . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice but to get involved in the creation of your house . The only question is , how far should you go ? Build it yourself , or write checks and watch from the sidelines ? To me , the only imperative is that the house comes from you . The number of people you get to help with the building is unimportant . Even the most rugged individualist with only a few hand tools and a pickup that hauls soil and straw ( for making cob ) has enlisted the help of hundreds of people - those who designed and built the truck , manufactured the tools or grew the straw . Enlisting the help of architects and builders is no different - we all need help . The important thing to realize is that the building buck stops with you - die house is your dream , and it 's your money . LEARN THE BASICS None of us are indigenous builders with an intuitive understanding of the materials we 'll be using and how they can come together to create a complete entity called a house . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) It 's not enough to say that you 're going to build a house with straw , earth or wood . You have to understand how those materials will interact wirh your particular outside environment in a way that creates the inside environment that you need to be comfortable , happy and healthy . To do mat , you 'll need to research four basic topics and how they relate to your particular situation . Whether you 're going to build it yourself or just take responsibility for the process , you need to understand : Structure . The manner in which your building will hold itself up . Temperature . The mechanism by which your building will maintain a basically stable interior temperature in the face of fluctuating outdoor temperatures . Separation . How you 'll separate your building from the destructive forces of nature ( sun , water , wind and life-forms ) . Connection . The ways in which your building will keep you in constant connection to those same natural forces - air , water , sunlight - because they are precisely what you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics , you 'll encounter differing opinions . In fact , if you 've ever seriously researched anything , then you 've learned that experts tend to disagree . In home construction , experts do n't just disagree , they sometimes live in alternate universes . I ca n't think of one basic building topic on which I have n't read credible yet diametrically opposed opinions : venting , vapor barriers , building materials , insulation values , air exchange - the list continues . Experts debate these things , and " best " practices go through constant revisions and updates . Photograph There is no substitute for practical experience . If you 're not familiar with construction , then learn valuable lessons by building a shed ( left ) or office ( right ) that 's a small , simple version of your house . // Another problem is misinformation . The fact is that many well-meaning people involved in the varied realm of green building see it as a crusade , a battle of good versus evil . In struggling to get people to listen , they can fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unfortunate result is that you have to take everything with a grain of salt . Here 's just one example : Until recently , it was common to see claims that three-string straw bale walls produce insulation values of up to R-60 ( R-value is a measurement of resistance to heat flow ) . After the excitement cleared and the science floated to the surface , it seems that the more accurate R-value for three-string straw bale walls is in the low 30s . That 's wonderful insulation , but it 's about half of the original claims . There are similar myths for many other green building systems and materials . The best protection against this problem is to distrust superlatives . If someone claims that a material or system is easy , cheap or the best , exercise at least a little skepticism . On the other hand , a plethora of useful information and wonderful , knowledgeable people are out there . You have to create a balance between your superior knowledge of your exact situation and the superior experience and general knowledge of experts . TRUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the places involved , theories and learning will only take you so far . When looking for guidance , you need to find people who share your green building point of view and have experience with your local environment , both climatic and human . If there are any surviving indigenous building practices in your area , then thats the first place to start - find out what the old-timers are doing . Do n't forget that in many ways there are more similarities than differences between green and conventional buildings . Therefore , local experience - even if it is staunchly conventional - often is quite valuable . Plastering is a good example . The ways in which different plaster mixes will perform in your area can be determined only through experience . I 'd rather discuss a mix with a local building veteran than have an experienced green builder from another climate choose my mix . The best approach is to listen to both experts and then make your own decision . CAN YOU BUILD IT ? The success of your house will be measured in the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look identical . One could be drafty , moldy and experience structural damage in just a few years . The odier could be warm and cozy , withstanding the elements for many years without damage . The difference would be in the details . Is the flashing correctly installed around the roof , chimney , doors , windows and at the base of the walls ? Where does rainwater go after it hits the roof ? Is there a foundation drain ? Was the passive solar thermal mass inside the house isolated from the earth and the outside air ? Should it have been for your climate ? The answers to these and other questions ca n't be easily determined after your house has been built . They require planning and careful attention to detail during construction . Detailing is a potential downside to choosing some green building techniques because these approaches are not yet part of die construction vernacular . Where do you turn for advice when you have technical difficulties attaching wood roof framing to a monolithic cob wall ; or when you are confused about flashing details for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Text that seems clear in print can be incredibly incomplete when you are trying to carry out the operation described . Inexperience and trailblazing do n't go well together . If you do n't know what you are doing , then choose building alternatives dial have a history in your area and lean on those experienced with them when you need help or advice . Having said all of that , I think you can build or be very involved in building your own house . The less experience you have , the more preparation you 'll have to do . The ideal approach would be to get involved in a project similar to your own with an experienced person in your area . If you plan to build with wood and straw , dien look for work - whether paid or volunteer - using those materials . If you cant find a project similar to what you have in mind , then build a small version of your house - perhaps a workshop or playhouse . Make sure it has all of the elements that your real house will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Either way you do it , the hands-on experience will teach you invaluable lessons : either that you do n't want to build your own house , or specific things you 'll need to do better to make the real house work . Though I 'm a professional builder and consultant now , my interest in housing started with the desire to build a house for myself . I began with a lot of book learning , then I eventually quit my job to become a construction worker . I spent several years learning by making a living in the building trades . Still , when I started building my house , I was overwhelmed by the task . It took about four times longer and cost much more than I had anticipated . It all turned out fine in the end , but I would n't want to do it again . On the other hand , my house is my biggest achievement . I know how everything goes together , its strengths and weaknesses . Building my own home has given me skills , muscles and a perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , I really recommend it . I 'll add this : No matter how much you prepare , in the end you wo n't think you prepared too much . IF YOU DO N'T WANT TO BUILD IT You 've done your research and you know what you want , but you do n't want to build it yourself . What do you do ? This is a difficult question because you are n't going to be the typical client - you want to be very involved in the decision-making process . There are things you definitely want to try ; there are other things you want to discuss before making a final decision . Many contractors will balk at this level of involvement , often for good reason . Professional builders are paid not only to build , but also to spend large amounts of their clients ' money . The fact that clients employ contractors to spend their money is often forgotten - nearly every builder has a handful of stories about bad clients . Approaching someone with such a history and saying you want your house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do your homework , this problem should solve itself . You 'll be able to explain the theories behind different aspects of the design and why they are important . Introduce your project with enthusiasm and honesty , and it will be obvious that you 're an important member of the team . Photograph The owner-builders of this straw bale home in western North Carolina took a patient and deliberate approach : gaining experience through other projects , getting to know the site beforehand and focusing on details during construction . // The problem of finding good people to work with is exacerbated by our modern mobile society . Probably the worst thing you can do is move to a new area and begin building right away . Not only will you be unfamiliar with local conditions , but you will have no social network on which to rely . Remember , we are social animals . You ca n't expect to build the kind of relationships needed to create such a masterpiece as a good house by screeching into town and waving your checkbook around . People work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build good houses for personal satisfaction and pride . If things are to go well , then your builder needs to be your friend , or at least someone who respects you as part of the community . Once you find someone who you trust and who is willing to work with you , make it your mantra that you will be a great client . Put yourself in the contractors shoes and it wo n't be difficult to calm down at frustrating moments . At the same time , you have to hold firm to making your own decisions . This is your house and having someone else build it is a compromise that waters down its specific nature to some degree . The balance between not getting in the way and remaining the decision maker will be a graceful dance . BOUNCE BACK FROM MISTAKES Regardless of how much you prepare , mistakes are inevitable . The best way to minimize them is with a construction process that combines intense preparation with flexibility while building . Let 's look at straw bale construction for an example . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when using straw bales . First , you need to decide how your bales are going to interact with water and water vapor . Next , you need to plan die logistics of the construction carefully . In my climate , I recommend using a skeletal framing structure and installing the bales as infill . That way , you can build a roof to shelter the bales before diey ever arrive . Finally , you need to plan all of the details that will keep your bales dry for many years to come : flashing , stem wall height , gutters , drainage and plaster . Even with all ofthat preparation , straw bale infill allows for some flexibility during construction . Window placement , for example , can be adjusted by mocking up bales and setting windows in place to see how they work . Diligent preparation will give you the peace of mind to be creative and adaptable during construction - that 's the dynamic you want . Of course you 're still going to make mistakes . You 'll be in very good , or at least very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to prepare , and , hey , we all make mistakes . As in life , the grace with which you bounce back will say more about you than pretty much anything else . THE PARADOX OF A GOOD HOUSE For me , green building is n't about fads , right versus wrong , how things ought to be or how you wish things were . It 's about how things are : How you are , how your land is and how the two can come together . Yet the true reason most people are drawn to building their own homes is to fulfill a dream - that place where you can relax , where all the pieces of your life come together in a harmonious whole . Photograph Whether you build your own house or hire a contractor , get involved in the process , says author Clarke Snell. // The paradox of building a good house is that you have to remain grounded in reality while dreaming . To do that , you have to understand and deal honestly with die realities of your situation - your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time constraints , your personal likes and dislikes , your social network - while allowing yourself to push die envelope of your perceived limitations . It 's the dance between these two poles that ultimately will lead to what will be your good house .
