Though our challenges are growing more complex , our tools for meeting those challenges are growing more sophisticated , according to speakers at WorldFuture 2006. // It has been said that it takes a village to raise a child , and it is becoming increasingly clear that it will take a global village to " raise " humanity-that is , to create a working future for all of the world 's people . Whether you are seeking the best education for your own child , brokering a deal for your company , or resolving a tense conflict between warring factions , one thing is certain : Relationships matter . This truism was suggested frequently in the observations of many speakers and participants at the World Future Society 's annual meeting , " WorldFuture 2006 : Creating Global Strategies for Humanity 's Future , " held in Toronto this past July . According to Society President Tim Mack , the conference welcomed more than 1,000 attendees from 34 countries , with the largest non-North American contingent arriving from South Korea . The goal of the meeting , Mack said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " - that is , to determine what it is we want to do next in creating our collective future . The Society last met in Toronto in 1980 , and its return to Canada afforded the opportunity to explore the importance of the Canadian-U.S. relationship . Accomplished journalist Pamela Wallin , who recently completed duties as Canada 's consul general to New York , emphasized the importance of face-to-face encounters in the " dance of diplomacy , " because " diplomacy is about seeing through other people 's eyes . " She quipped , " The Canadian and U.S. views of each other are like a one-way mirror , " where the United States is " benevolently ignorant " of Canada , while Canadians are wiser-and not always benevolently so-about the United States . Even neighbors as close as Canada and the United States need to work diligently on their relationship , Wallin said , citing John F. Kennedy 's famous observation about the United States and Canada : " Geography has made us neighbors . History has made us friends . Economics has made us partners . And necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally change , but Wallin cautioned that " getting along does n't always mean going along with the decisions of your partner . " Challenges for the Future More than 100 sessions at World-Future 2006 addressed these and other major forces of change : * A " demographic tsunami " is looming on the " coast " of the United States as baby boomers approach retirement age , according to David Walker , comptroller general of the U.S. Government Accountability Office . * Computer capacity is increasing in accordance with Moore 's law-it was predicted in 1965 to double every 18 months for the next 10 years , but Moore 's law has held and will hold " as far as the eye can see , " according to science writer Joel Garreau . The only limitations come from quantum mechanics , human ingenuity , the market , and human values . * Technologies are increasingly being turned inward in such areas as human enhancement , Garreau added . For example , four U.S. companies are already racing to bring " memory pills " to the market , which will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging baby boomers. * Global warming will have civilization-altering impacts on the planet . " We may be within 10 years of irreversible climate change , " said scholar Thomas Homer-Dixon of the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto . Creative Collaboration Solving these problems will require new solutions that demand not just technological ingenuity , but also collaboration and creative resourcefulness . Individuals are becoming more technologically empowered-with both positive and negative consequences . Among the most dangerous , according to Homer-Dixon , is the capability of smaller groups or even individuals to kill more people . And yet , that same empowerment is letting communities do things like create online " crime maps " of their neighborhoods and do better real-time surveillance and reporting than police departments can do , said Deborah Osborne , a crime analyst with the Buffalo Police Department . Joel Garreau , too , noted the power of technology-enabled individuals , such as those on Flight 93 who , on September 11 , 2001 , came up with a " bottom-up " solution and took collective action to thwart terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass destruction . Leadership could do a much better job of nurturing our connected " oneness , " said Lance Secretan , former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations Environment Program and the author of One : The Art and Practice of Conscious Leadership ( The Secretan Center , 2006 ) . Many of our problems , he said , are due to leaders who are cowardly , self-serving , dishonest , unfeeling , and ineffective . He described the " CASTLE " principles for leadership that will enhance our oneness : Courage , Authenticity , Service , Truthfulness , Love , and Effectiveness . Connecting to Deal with Complexity One of today 's greatest challenges is the complexity of the problems we face . In health care , for instance , it is difficult for a family doctor to treat complicated diseases or conditions such as diabetes , noted William Rowley , COO and senior futurist at the Institute for Alternative Futures . Patients may be referred to specialists rather than treated immediately by one doctor . One solution may be found in community health centers in inner cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the Futures Lab 's Wayne Pethrick put it , " It 's not what you know that matters . You do n't need to know everything . What matters is who you know that knows . " Connectivity , he suggested , is critical . This connectivity is taking new forms , as virtual relationships become more commonplace , said Derek Woodgate , president of the Futures Lab and co-author , with Pethrick , of Future Frequencies . " You might have more friends on My-Space a social networking Web site than in real life , " he pointed out . " We 're reconceptualizing intimacy . " Another distinction of MySpace as opposed to other media is that its entire contents are created by users , who upload not only information about themselves , but also their own videos , photos , and music , according to Stephanie MacKendrick , president of Canadian Women in Communications . But technology is not a panacea for connectivity , MacKendrick warned , and " connectivity " is not the same as effectiveness . We may be incorrect in thinking that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies such as the increasingly ubiquitous cell phone . " We fear being out of touch , " she pointed out . " We lose confidence in our ability to operate on our own . " Cell phone use in public may also be creating more reserve among strangers in public . Institutions such as governments and corporations may have a harder time dealing with change than individuals do . As GAO 's David Walker pointed out , the U.S. government simply does not have a strategic plan for the future or for dealing with the megatrends shaping the future , though the work of the GAO comes close , since it uses foresight tools such as modeling and scenario planning . " Government structures need to be rearranged to capitalize on opportunities " and to deal with challenges such as a potential bird flu pandemic and population aging , Walker said . GAO 's work is based on environmental scanning , conducted both by employees and by outside futurist consultants . Walker pointed out that 188 countries have GAO-like of-fices-auditors-that are helping sort out the challenges and opportunities of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demographic facts and are now doing something to address the fiscal challenges of aging populations . Walker said that knowledge sharing among governments would encourage greater cooperation on issues such as sustainability . To do this will require the transformation of government structures . The United States needs to recognize " that challenges need multilateral , global efforts . No country can or should go it alone , " he said . Scenario planning and strategic planning are not enough . The United States , he said , needs to change how it thinks and acts : It needs to " partner for progress " - to reach across institutional lines to share knowledge , including with business and with other countries . " America faces decades of red ink due to aging population , " because of the health-care crunch , entitlement programs , and other issues , Walker warned . " There is no way we will grow our way out of this fiscal hole , . . . and time is working against us . " Reducing the Risks of Change Many futurist consultants are devoted to helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and several participating at the conference offered insights . Kenneth Hunter of the University of Maryland 's Institute for Global Chinese Affairs said never tell people you 're going to change something instantly ; rather , " relentless prototyping " is the more effective approach in introducing change , as it allows for testing improvements and reduces people 's anxiety in making wholesale change . " Change implementers must be capable of working on the connections among groups , " Hunter said . " Help them deal with their fear of loss . People resist leaving their comfort zone . " Dealing with risk and rapid change could drive the " next big thing " in technological development-the convergence of systems to enable problem solving at lower risks . The " killer app " here is simulation , said Jeff Wacker , vice president and CIO of Global Industry Solutions for EDS . With advanced pattern recognition and powerful new models that provide the relevant contextual information about the overwhelming mass of data we can now gather , " the future will become more predictable . " World Future Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance because ways of doing things become entrenched ; assumptions and procedures are seldom challenged . Thus , " If you 're the one suggesting change , you need to have more than good information . Keep it positive : Somebody always profits from change . Look for ways you can impart that information and show how people can benefit from it . " Brown was one of the participants in a session entitled " The Search for Intelligence Life : Why Foresight Systems Fail and How to Make Them Work , " which was moderated by Jay McIntosh , Americas director of retail and consumer products for Ernst &; Young , the session 's sponsor . Often resistance to change has to do with an inability to analyze risk appropriately . " Risk aversion hinders progress , " said Randall Yim , formerly head of the U.S. Homeland Security Institute . " We focus on blame and judge effectiveness with results , when luck has a lot to do with it , " Yim said . " ' Smart luck " is opportunity that you 're prepared for . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a culture of fear . " Yim observed that the Department of Homeland Security was created in order to improve information sharing , but it did n't happen because there was still a strong culture of secrecy . A better model of information sharing , he said , would be an infrastructure similar to the highway system , with multiple information destinations . Business futurist Edle Weiner , president of Weiner , Edrich , Brown , Inc. , agreed , arguing that we need to look at multiple , " parallel information streams of intelligence , " as information critical to an organization is increasingly nonlinear and contradictory . Much of this critical intelligence is open and freely shared ; Weiner noted , for example , that Eli Lilly collects intelligence shared by scientists all over the world and that many organizations now use blogs to gather intelligence . One challenge to this open-source knowledge sharing is determining what information is true and useful . Once again , the message is that relationships matter : As Weiner noted , you are more likely to value the opinion of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares your values than the advice of a remote , distracted doctor who does not . " It 's all about relationships , " she said . " If you want to make intelligence systems work , take a lot of people to lunch . " Maps for the Future Since it 's hard to go anywhere without a road map , many speakers focused on ways of conceptualizing and contextualizing the future . For instance , George Washington University management professor William E. Halal described the work of the TechCast project he directs . TechCast creates an " online learning system " to enable experts in a variety of fields to collectively forecast when emerging technologies may reach mainstream status . ( For more information , see Halal 's article in this issue . ) Similarly , consultant Jim Mathews of The Futures Network LLC offered a detailed analysis of technology life cycles , which can help companies understand the risks of bringing a new product to market . Another " map " to understanding change on a large scale is the Spiral Dynamics theory , originally developed by psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emergence founder Don E. Beck . By improving our understanding of the transmission of values and the bases of our core intelligence , we can better see how these forces shape our futures . It is more important , Beck believes , to understand how people think than what they think , as well as why they make the decisions they do and what motivates them . " This powerful conceptual system has been field-tested in some of the most complex environments on the planet , from inner-city Chicago to racially plagued South Africa , " according to Beck . For understanding society 's relationship with technology , the " TechnEcologies " paradigm described by Joel Barker and Scott Erickson , co-authors of Five Regions of the Future : Preparing Your Business for Tomorrow 's Technology Revolution , offered lucid guidance . Technologies exist within cultural contexts that determine their function and value to society . For instance , wind power is an example of " Local Tech " that scale science and technology to meet needs at a very local level . By contextualizing technologies , we can better see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocks . " The Five Regions paradigm tries to look at technology in a different way , in terms of applications , " Barker explained . " We 're living in a time when we 're generating more solutions than problems , " he concluded . Sidebar Dave Mowat of Vancity shares strategies for corporate social responsibilty .

Sidebar Ray Kurzweil 's Fast and Furious Future Will computers become so integrated into our environment that they disappear from view ? Will we replace our white blood cells with microscopic Internet-linked machines ? Will the human life-span extend beyond 200 years ? According to futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil , the answer to all of the above is " yes . " In two special presentations at WorldFuture 2006 , Kurzweil shed light on what he sees as the hidden dangers of the overlapping biotechnology , nanotechnology , and artificial intelligence revolutions . The world-renowned inventor and National Technology Medal recipient also spoke prodigiously of a revolutionary and fast-approaching future . " It 's a pleasure to be before a group that thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The conventional wisdom is you ca n't predict the future . That 's true for individual companies . But the overall impact of information technology follows very predictable paths . The paradigm shift rate is now doubling every decade . In the twenty-first century , we will see 20,000 years of progress at today 's rate of advancement . " Kurzweil provided numerous examples of what he calls the " exponential nature of progress , " giving his views on where that progress would lead us in both the near and the distant future . " When you apply the doubling factor for information , you see that some of the most fantastic sounding scenarios are actually quite conservative , " he said . For instance , because our understanding of the human genome is doubling every year , Kurzweil predicted we will be able to cure many of the diseases we face today-e.g. , diabetes and Parkinson's-within the next 10 to 15 years . He also predicted that , by 2010 , computers will integrate themselves everywhere into our environment . A high point of the conference was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbed the Kurzweil National Federation of the Blind reader ( K-NFB ) . In a tense moment , the large , crowded ballroom quieted as Kurzweil ran a small , handheld device over a section of his most recent book , The Singularity Is Near . The device read from the text in a clear , distinct voice . To wit : " The AI artificial intelligence winter is long since over . We are well into the spring of narrow AI . Most of the examples above were research projects just 10 to 15 years ago . If all the AI systems in the world suddenly stopped functioning , our economic infrastructure would grind to a halt . Your bank would cease doing business . Most transportation would be crippled . Most communications would fail . This was not the case a decade ago . Of course , our AI systems are not smart enough-yet-to organize such a conspiracy .
