The first Caddie Winger ever heard of Wake House was when she was helping her grandmother get her drawers on over the cast on her leg . It was Nana 's second day back from the hospital . " If I was at Wake House , " she said , lying flat on the sofa and holding her bunched-up nightgown over her lap for modesty , " somebody who knew what they were doing would be doing this . " " What house ? Awake ? " " Wake House . That place on Calvert Street across from the thing . The thing , where you go with papers . To get signed . " " The notary ? Put your good foot in here , Nan . Are you talking about that old house with the tower and all the porches ? I think it 's a boardinghouse . " " Before . Now it 's an old folks ' home . " " Oh , you do n't need to go to a place like that , I can take care of you fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nana mentioning a nursing home , imagine that . For the rest of the morning Caddie pondered what it might mean . When the old lady across the street went dotty and her children put her in a nursing home , Nana was aghast . " Shoot me if you ever want to get rid of me that bad , you hear ? Take me out in the backyard and fire away . " Caddie assumed the subject of nursing homes was off-limits forever . That afternoon , though , out of the blue , Nana brought up Wake House again . They were on the front porch , Nana slumped in her rented wheelchair , resting her broken leg on a pillow on top of the low kitchen stool . Caddie stood behind her , braiding her hair . Nana had long , pretty , smokegray hair and , before it softened with age , a long , bony , sharp-featured face . She loved it when people told her she looked like Virginia Woolf . Nobody ever added , " If she 'd lived to seventy-nine instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she said , breaking a drowsy silence . " Who died where , Nan ? " " Wake House . What's-her-name , you know . Pink hair , Tuesday nights . " Hm . Back in Nana 's Buddhist period , when she 'd led a chanting service in the dining room one night a week , an elderly lady who dyed her hair pink had shown up occasionally . " Mrs. Pringle ? " " Inez Pringle , thank you . " " She died at Wake House ? " Nana shrugged . " You have to die someplace . " Caddie leaned over to see if she was joking . Her eyes were fixed on something out in the yard  --  Caddie followed her gaze to what was left of George Bush in Love . That 's how she 'd broken her leg , by falling off the stepladder while putting a final cowboy boot on top of her phallus-shaped , seven-foot-high lawn sculpture . Nana was an artist . " Are you serious ? " Caddie asked . A moment passed . " About what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to braiding her hair . How were they going to wash it ? This old house had only one bathroom , upstairs , and right now Nana could n't stand up at the kitchen sink for longer than a minute or two . Maybe one of those dry shampoos , they were supposed to ... " About Wake House ? Damn right I 'm serious . Call ' em up , find out how much it costs to stay there . " Her next pain pill was n't for forty minutes . She 'd broken her leg in two places , but luckily the breaks were simple , so her recovery was supposed to be long and tedious but not tricky or dangerous . The pain made her irritable , though . That 's all Caddie could think of to account for Nana 's sudden interest in recovering anyplace except the house on Early Street she 'd lived in for fifty years . " Wake House . I even like the sound of it . " " You do ? " It made Caddie think of a funeral home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not a mick ... mick ... " " McNursing Home , " Caddie guessed . " This place is going to the dogs . " " Our house ? " " The whole neighborhood . It 's not even safe anymore . " " Yes , it is . " " No , it 's not . " Caddie stopped arguing , because she never won , but Nana was exaggerating . Early Street might not be what it used to be , not that it had ever been that much , but it still had decent , hardworking families with fairly well-behaved children , plenty of old-timers rocking out their afternoons on the shady , crooked front porches . Crime was still pretty much in the vandalism category , boys breaking things or writing on things . It was getting older , that 's all . Everything got older . " Wake House , " Nana resumed . " I bet it 's got an elevator . Ramps , wheelchairs with motors . People giving you massages . " " Oh , boy . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is a death trap . " " Only about half an hour till your next pill , then you 'll feel better . Want me to play the piano ? You could listen through the window . " " Look it up in the yellow pages . Better yet , take me to see it  --  I always wanted to go inside that place . It 's not just for old folks , you can get well there , too . Conva ... conva ... " " Nan , I know you do n't want to , but if you would just go upstairs , this whole thing would be a lot simpler . I really think . " " No way . " " You 'd be near the bathroom  --  you know how you hate that climb up the stairs four or five times a day . You could sleep in your own bed instead of the lumpy couch . You would n't have to move every time one of my students comes over for a lesson . You could have a bell or a whistle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't mind a bit . It just makes so much more  --  " " No . " " But why ? " " I told you , I 'm not going up there . " " But why not ? " " Once you go up , you never come down . " " Nana , you only broke your leg . " " That 's it , I 've made up my mind . Wake House . I used to know the family , you know . " Maybe Caddie could take one of Nana 's pills for the headache she was getting ...
