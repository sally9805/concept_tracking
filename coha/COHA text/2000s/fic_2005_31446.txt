Endurance Tests Two days after his dog gets hit by a car , my son starts playing dead . I 'm washing dishes when I see him through the kitchen window : sprawled in the backyard , neck bent in a tight angle against the bottom of a tree , the undersides of his arms mushroom pale . I run for the back door , plates rattling on the counter , my sudsy hands slipping on the knob . " Chris ! " I yell , on my knees next to him . " Chris ! " Crying as I reach to straighten his arms and legs , lift his head from the hollow of the tree root . But I force myself not to touch , not to damage him further . " Please , " I whisper . Arms wobbling , I push myself to my feet to call 911 , and then I see him smile . Just slightly , the corner of his mouth tucking into the cheek . Squinting up at me through one slitted eye . " Gotcha . " Behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'd dug Jake 's grave . It was dark as I shoveled pieces of wet earth and piled them to one side , and I was n't sure how well the shrubs would camouflage . But Chris had already seen the heavy garbage bag dragged behind the garage and the towel , rusty with blood and dirt , stuffed into the bin . I 'd said it would be better to stay in his room , knowing even as the words pressed past my lips that he would n't . His face against the front window , watching me pass . Me slapping the mound with the shovel , knowing it would n't matter how flat it was ; he would n't forget what he had seen or turn his mind from what was gone . The next night , my ears twitch as Chris fizzes motor sounds in the bath , varying them for each boat , each speed . My breath loud in my ears at any silence . " Hey , Mom , " he calls . " Can you get me a towel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nonchalance in mine . " I thought second graders remembered that kind of thing , " I say from the bathroom doorway . " Come on , Mom . " " Just going with what you 've told me . " The phone rings , and I point a finger at him . " No splashing all over the floor . " Wet head flipping water with the nod , a fierce motor sound . I 'm busy here . Back down the hallway , I grab the phone just before the answering machine clicks . " Hello ? " Silence . " Oh , sorry , I almost hung up . " Ben . " Hi , " I say , no nonchalance this time , just a compression , a loss of air . " I thought you were n't there . " " Chris is in the bath . " " Well , that 's what I was calling about . " " His bath ? " I joke hollowly . Faint motor sounds buzzing down the hallway . " Come on , Elise . Chris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get used to visitation rights . Sometimes , I want to shake Ben at the front door and make him explain why he 's so good about getting his two weekends a month , when four years ago he could n't wait to leave us both . Other times I feel sorry for him . On the good days . " And why are n't we doing Saturday like normal ? " I flip through my desk calendar , phone cord twisting around my wrist . " Because I want to take him up to the cottage . I told you last time . " He had , but I want to make him tell me again . This is my game . Playing amnesia . " Are you sure he 's up to being away from home two nights in a row ? " I bargain . " Elise , he wants to go , and you know it . " " So it 's just going to be you two ? " " Of course . " " Guys ' weekend , huh ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake . " " No dogs for a while unless you keep it , " I say , and he sighs . I 've won this round , but it does n't matter . My ears twitch again , scanning for splash sounds , but there are none . " All right , whatever . When can I come by ? " " Six . See you . " I 'm already hanging up , his good-bye tiny and canned . I glide down the hall , remembering playing Indian when I was Chris 's age , silently moving over leaves . I 'm on patrol , ready to catch him at it this time . I push open the door , and he 's face down , arms and legs splayed , hair clouding out from his scalp . " Chris , " I demand . Then shout . I look for a heartbeat to tremble the surface , but then I ca n't wait ; I 'm on my knees , sliding on tiles , dragging him from the water , maybe more roughly than necessary . He twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . But his eyes are still closed , as if that alone can maintain the illusion . I sit him on the mat and lean against the tub next to him , not caring that the water 's soaking through to my underwear . " Why are you doing this ? " I watch him breathe , touch dripping horns of hair , try to replace my grab with gentleness . No response . Even now , shivering , arms wrapping around his chest , he does n't open his eyes . He grits his teeth to stop their chattering . " It scares me when you play dead . Is that what you want ? " He opens his eyes and hugs himself tighter . " I want my towel . " That night , I stare at the ceiling for a good hour before finally giving up on sleep . Downstairs I 'm looking through bills . Too late to call Marcie , my closest friend , even with her late hours and the time difference . In our small town , Marcie was the only child whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest and remarried . My father was gone , too ; dead of a heart attack only two years after I was born . So Marcie and I were linked , daughters without fathers , and our mothers let us wander between our houses like sisters . But it was the summer of the endurance tests that glazed our friendship , preserving it for later years . The drills started by the creek that ran behind all of the houses on our street . The first test involved walking barefoot over the sharp stones that washed down from the quarry . Sandals for markers . That first day , Marcie moved them farther and farther apart as the sun angled down through the trees , and I would n't back down , even when the wrinkled skin between my toes bled . We limped home . Then at it again , the next day . It was Marcie who pushed me to get up when I crouched , soaking my raw toes in the trickling water , our secret preparation . In bed again , I set my own marker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about playing dead . Something tells me there might be better choices , that I should be patient and communicative , talk through the problem , all the wisdoms I might offer a parent complaining of a homework-refusing child on teacher conference night . But in times of discomfort , we turn to what we know , and my accountant mother was n't one to facilitate self-esteem through family involvement after a full day of crunching numbers , for which she was paid far less than her male counterparts . So the next night , I 'm all business , helping Chris pick out school clothes and making him a lunch downstairs while he selects a story to read to me . But when I come back upstairs , he 's already turned out the overhead light ; only the night light glows beside his bed . Stretched on his back , eyes pinched closed , chin pointing up in an angle defying the relaxation of sleep . I sit on the bed , my hip against his rib cage , and run my fingers through his fine brown hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I whisper in his ear , letting my lips tickle him . " You are n't fooling me . OK ? " This is too much ; he squirms and opens his eyes . " Mom , " he moans , stretching the word into two syllables , " I was sleeping . " " No , you were n't . " I match the singsong in his voice . " Yes , I was . " " Honey , please . Give me a break . " " No ! " Angry now , he twists away from me , shoulders curled into his neck . Much as I had done , those nights of fiercely whispered arguments , to Ben . Marcie and I were writing and occasionally visiting in college when I met Ben . I was new to dating , on which Marcie alternately teased and coached me . During fall break of my senior year , I spent a weekend with her at Amherst , where she was studying political science on scholarship and secretly dating her married professor . When I told her Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she shook her head . " With all the men I 've dated , you 'd think someone would 've asked me by now . " Books and notes surrounded her on the narrow kitchen table . She rolled a tube of lipstick under one hand . " Not , " she said , " that I would say yes . " That spring , my mother flew with me to Ohio , where Ben 's large family lived . She walked me down the aisle of the small church ; Marcie was my maid of honor . The reception took place on Ben 's family 's farm  --  sweet wine and slices of roast beef on sun-dappled paper plates . I would have agreed to live there , if he had suggested it . But we came to this town because Ben and a college friend planned to start their own architectural firm . Ben wanted to design a house for us , but there was never time between my teaching and his fledgling business . We bought this house , and I was happy that it was near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , which I imagined crowded with our future children and their neighborhood friends . Over the next six years , Ben knocked in walls , moved doorways , and added skylights and porches and landscaping , as if these would make him believe we were n't living in a row of houses as uniform as beads on a string . When I wanted to discuss children , offering to quit my job , Ben said we could n't afford it ; what with a mortgage and the firm 's uncertain future , we needed my teacher 's salary . I knew exactly what he was trying to do when he brought Jake home from the pound ; he wanted to put me off , substitute a dog for a child . Of course , once Ben had agreed to fatherhood , he seemed to embrace it , but somehow I felt his meticulous preparations were more for himself than our child . He built a crib with high slats ; he installed an intercom system  --  the speaker on my side of the bed . He spent long hours working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said one night , pulling a pillow to himself . Instead of me . Eating dinner Friday evening , I study Chris as he checks the bright-green watch his father gave him with the same upward snap of his wrist . He glances at me , as if he feels guilty to want to know the time . His duffel bag waits by the front door . " Are you excited ? " I ask . " Yeah . Dad says he 's going to take me out in his boat . " " That sounds good . " " And he 's gon na let me ride with him on his jet ski . " " Would you like some more milk ? " I 'm at the fridge without waiting for Chris 's answer , imagining him in all that water , all those cold waves . " Dad said he knows a man who has beagles , and he might get me one . " " How about you let Santa bring you one . " " But Christmas is far away ! " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but  --  " " Did you pack your toothbrush ? " I ask , although I 'd watched him drop it into his red bag . He does n't bother to answer ; he knows this is my way of derailing him . Playing distracted . Instead , he gets up to help me clear the dishes . He 's unfailingly polite on the weekends he goes with his father , as if to make it up to me for leaving . It does n't help , even though I appreciate the gesture . I already feel rattled and lonely , anticipating the time without him . The first couple of years after the divorce , I got dressed up when Ben came because I wanted him to think I had suddenly developed a full social life . I knew it was ridiculous . I felt like those soap opera actresses Marcie and I despised , waiting for our cartoons to begin . We sneered at the rich women answering phones in silk dresses , sleeping in red lipstick . How fake , we said . We did n't know adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help myself at first . Playing desirable . These days I do n't bother to dress for those few minutes at the front door . Doorbell , two short rings . Efficient . I let Chris get it . Ben steps in , and I take my time coming to greet him . He 's still tan from the summer , started a beard . Button-down shirt open at the throat , a sweater loose across his shoulders . He catches Chris in his arms and bends to pick up his bag . " Have a good time , " I say . Smiling like he 's someone I 'm passing on the street . " Thanks , " Ben says . And then , " OK , give Mom a kiss . " I lean in for it , closing my eyes so as not to face Ben that closely . Then I shut the door behind them and hold on to the knob , not wanting to walk through the empty house , touch what Chris has left behind . Saturday night : video rentals and lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about the playing dead . " I do n't know either , " she says . " I do n't even know how to get along with Phillip 's kids ! " " I ca n't even talk to him about it . I could n't say , ' Do n't , " I tell her , " ' do this with your father , ' because I do n't want to give him ideas . " I 'm looking out the kitchen window , the backyard tree where Chris folded himself yellowed with porch light . How long did he wait for me to notice ? " Did you tell Ben about it ? " Refrigerator door opening , a cork pulled from a bottle . I pictured the sound bouncing against high ceilings , paintings . " No . He 'd have ten ways I should have handled it . And I can already see him deciding all Chris needs is a new dog , " I say , yawning . The thought exhausts me . " Such a problem solver . But I 'd be the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then there 's what I really feared about telling Ben : Chris playing dead in the white lake waves  --  only not playing dead but drowning  --  and Ben lulled by my explanations . Playing tough . But Marcie has moved on to Chicago 's latest snowstorm and the competition for her job in the prosecutor 's office . She 's living only a couple of hours away from her father but refuses contact with him . Says he had his chance . Me pouring a glass of wine I do n't need , wanting to say the same to Ben . Trying to imagine her life in that lake city , her apartment in some tall , narrow building , her freedom to choose her future , as Ben chose his . We hang up , and I think of the years gone , the tests by the creek , the day she pushed her curly hair behind her ears and then pulled mine into a rubber band ; she never stopped talking , never gave me a chance to object . A lawyer even then . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she 'd said . Words flattened by the rubber band held in her teeth . " You know ? We have to stick together . " I did n't know . Not then . I closed my eyes and tilted back my head as she pulled the ends of my ponytail to tighten the band . " This stuff could come in handy , " Marcie continued . " You never know when you 'll have to give it all you got . " She clenched her fists , and I knew she meant it . We kneeled on a large , flat stone beside a deeper point in the creek . Between our two pairs of hands sat the watch Marcie had just gotten for her eleventh birthday  --  narrow , orange-gold , made for a small wrist . " OK , I 'm gon na count to three and then dunk . " I felt my heart speed up as she counted ; my breaths caught higher in my throat . " Go ! " she said and then gulped in air as she plunged her face into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye as I did the same , skin slapped by the stinging cold . Hands sliding down the side of the rock , digging into smaller , rounded stones in the creek bed . Holding ground . I imagined my face becoming stone , the blood rushing to my head and freezing there . But I did not want to be the first one up . I dug farther into the silt , bit my lip , squeezed my eyes shut tighter . Then I half heard , half felt Marcie pull up to breathe . I followed , and we collapsed on our backs , gasping and coughing . Water running into my ears like cold tears . Marcie checked her watch . When she could speak , she sat up . " A minute and three seconds , " she said , after she caught her breath . " Now , let 's try for a minute fifteen . " On our knees again . While we were under , she grabbed my hand , and we twisted our fingers together . When she started to rise , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up together . Sunday evening , Ben at the door with Chris over his shoulder , asleep . " Could I get some coffee before I hit the road ? " he asks . " Sure . " Heading for the kitchen , wondering if he had questions for me . Any idea why Chris pretended to fall out of the boat ? Playing the better parent . " It 's OK ; I 'll make it , " Ben says , following me . Chris awake now , reaching for me in a way that makes me pull in my breath in gratitude . Ben hands him over . I help him upstairs , into pajamas , into bed . Downstairs , Ben 's opening cabinets , lost in the silverware drawer . I wait until the coffee maker finishes gurgling before I come back . Ben is in the living room , looking out the front window , although in the dark all he can see is his own reflection . Tips the mug back , almost finished . Holds the liquid in his mouth as if he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize . " So , was it a good time ? " Ben swallows , nods . " I think I completely wore him out . " " Well , I guess that 's good , " I say . He looks at me , then inspects his mug , and I ca n't find anything in his expression as he takes it to the kitchen . " I have to get going , " he says . I 'm at the door , waiting to open it until he 's close enough , so as not to appear too eager . Playing polite . He breathes a good-bye , barely looking at me as he passes , hunting the keys in his pocket . Next day , Chris and I are heading home from school , the backseat loaded with his backpack and my students ' geography tests . Mondays are art days for the second graders , and in his lap Chris cradles something wrapped in a brown paper towel . " What is it ? " I ask . Chris pulls back a corner of the coarse paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , but we had to let ' em dry . " " Did you start anything new today ? " " No , I painted it today . " " What is it ? " " Wait until we get home , " he orders , and I laugh , knowing this is payback for all the times I 've made him wait to open fast-food , grocery-store trinkets . " So , was the lake fun ? " My hand on his arm as we turn a corner . Wanting to press him against the seat , hold him safe . Every time . " Yeah . We went out in the boat a lot . " " Sounds like fun . " " Yeah , " Chris says , but he lets his head fall back against the seat . " But ? " " Well , he did n't let me drive . " Good for you , Ben , I think . We pull into the driveway ; I wait while Chris lifts the garage door . It takes all his strength , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our respective bundles inside . I ca n't hold back my question . " You did n't give your dad any scares this weekend , did you ? " Chris pulls his bag and art project closer to his chest . " I told him we 're gon na wait for a while to get a dog . " " OK . " But I 'm not satisfied . I drop the keys , the papers in my arms threatening avalanche . Chris sets down his bag , picks up the keys , unlocks the door . Faces me for a moment before stepping back to let me in . " It 's easier when I 'm away , " he says . " When I 'm here , there 's everything . You know ? " Does n't wait for a response , which is good because I do n't have one . Except : You think I do n't remember everything , too ? But I keep it to myself , watch him unwrap his creation on the kitchen table . A red and blue lump . Red for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were our colors once . " Why red ? " I had asked . " Because it goes with blue , " he said . I lean to hug him , breathe in the bubble-gum scent of his Ninja Turtle shampoo . " It 's beautiful . Where do you want to put it ? " The colors blend as I turn it . " Watch out , it 's still a little wet . " He 's right . Smudges on my fingertips . I put it down . " The mantel ? " " No . It 's for Jake . " I try to add up what he means . But he 's ahead of me . " I want to put it on his grave . " Holding the back door open with his foot . " OK , " I say , pretending to have known what he meant all along . Playing smart . Wondering how many times I 've missed the point . I pull a mason jar from a cabinet . " Let 's put it in this so the paint does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mouth of the jar , his hand still small enough to set it gently on the bottom . I follow him through the yard , past the tree , through the bushes to the mound . He squats beside it , digs a shallow pit with his fingers , places the jar in it . Pats the dirt back around it to make sure it wo n't fall . Tonight Chris 's light is off when I come upstairs from packing his lunch . He 's on his side with his back to me , and I lean against the door frame , weighing whether to come in . He rolls over and squints at me . " Can I have a back rub ? " " Sure . " He flips on his stomach , and I give him the Chris version of a back rub  --  long , gentle strokes from his shoulders to the base of his spine . We do n't speak . When his arms relax and his cheek sinks against the pillow , I slowly swing my legs onto the bed , prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve of mine . I hold him close , as I did the day Jake was hit . It was wet  --  that was the driver 's excuse . Chris and I were getting ready to take Jake for a walk . Streams of rain on the windowpanes still thinning , and Chris tying his shoes while Jake circled and sneezed with excitement . I grabbed a light jacket and called out for Chris to do the same , but he was chasing Jake outside . At the open front door , I bent to pick up the leash and my beat-up loafers , watching Chris rearing back to toss a bone treat to Jake . Jake knew this game ; he was already backing up , preparing for a long chase . " Good throw ! " I said , the bone sailing high into the air . Jake lost track of it but kept running full speed toward the edge of the yard . And then the silver-blue car rounded the curve . I think Chris and I realized at the same time what was going to happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off down the driveway . I dropped the leash and my shoes and jumped off the steps onto the grass , fear already so heavy in me I thought my knees would buckle . In two running strides , I was on the driveway , and I do n't remember if what I heard were the squealing wheels or my own screams to Chris as my feet smacked against cement . I do n't think I have ever seen anything move so fast as my own son , running toward that car . But I caught him  --  tackled him , actually  --  and pressed his face into my neck as Jake was thrown from under the front wheels . The man got out of his car as I hurried Chris inside , ushering him upstairs . " I 'm so sorry , " the man said . He said it again . He looked truly dismayed , brown raincoat frowning with wrinkles . Did I speak to him ? To the garage and back outside with an old towel and garbage bag ; maybe the man said nothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes narrowed so as not to see clearly how the skull had been crushed . That night , holding Chris until his eyes closed in tear-swollen sleep , I wanted to call Marcie , but it was late . If I had called , I would have said that she had been right all along about the tests , how we had to be strong . But I would have told her those creek days were pale preparation , that we never could have held our breath long enough or set our shoes far enough apart . Continues ...
