Albert Handell advises artists on how to discover , sketch , and compose pastel landscapes . <p> I do n't like to travel more than twenty to thirty minutes from my studio to find a painting location . <p> If it 's farther than that , I prefer to stay for a few days at a nearby hotel . Once I arrive at the location , I scout around until I can isolate a scene that touches me . <p> Before I begin painting , I try to make a connection with a part of the landscape . With all that nature has to offer , I want to make sure that I am painting the subject that most attracts me . After I have finished my pastel painting , I like to explore the area to see if there are other motifs to work with . If there are , I plan to return as soon as possible to take advantage of them . VIEWFINDERS <p> With so much subject matter to take in outdoors , it is sometimes difficult to focus in and simplify what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame a composition and determine what to include and what to leave out . This can be as basic as holding up the thumb and index finger on both hands to form a rectangle to sight the area you are considering . A viewfinder can also be made from an empty slide frame or two right-angle pieces of matte board , which can be moved to form a variety of shapes and formats . There is also a wonderful product called Picture Perfect . This has three different formats with tinted windows to help you view your composition and gauge the values of the colors in it . SETTING UP <p> It is much easier setting up to paint on a gray day than on a sunny day . In the absence of the sun , you can set up anywhere and expect a good steady light on your subject , as well as on your easel and palette . Light does n't present any problems . <p> But on a sunny day , setting up is more complicated . It 's best to set up your easel and your painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . This keeps your palette of colors and painting surface in the same kind of light , the soft light of a cast shadow . If you ca n't set up in a cast shadow , the next best thing is to set up in direct sunlight , with both the palette of colors and the painting surface in sunlight . <p> Your palette and painting surface must always be under the same light condition . Otherwise the same colors will look different , throwing off your painting . RETURNING TO A LOCATION <p> I believe in going back to the same area to paint time and time again , as long as you have something new to say . Valuable experience can come from returning to the same subject at different times of the day , in different seasons , and in different weather conditions . It gives you an intimacy with your subject and an awareness of how different it can look under various light conditions . <p> I painted the same location in two paintings , Taos Red and Ranch Land , the former in February and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I caught the landscape on a sunny day , with white snow patches in the foreground . It was overcast when I returned to paint Ranch Land . Notice how completely different the same subject looks in a different season and weather , and from a different perspective . I have passed by this same subject in midsummer and the green leaves take on an importance that ca n't be imagined during the winter months . DISCOVERING YOUR SUBJECT <p> Students often ask how I choose one subject from a multitude of subjects . I admit that my choices are based on intuition . Once something moves me , I try to visualize how it will appear on the size and shape of my surface . <p> It can take years of experience to develop an intuitive sense for finding a subject and to sense how this subject will fit on paper . Even before I have made a mark on the paper , I can already sense whether it will work or not . To artists for whom this Zen approach is inadequate , I recommend making sketches on location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of detail to establish the center of interest . The placement of these shapes is important to the composition . Draw lightly using a hard pastel or a piece of soft charcoal . It may be necessary to adjust the placement of the shapes to improve the composition . The lines you establish will direct the eye . Using the tip of a pastel , you can create expressive lines and further define a shape . You can use the side of a pastel to create areas of tone , suggesting mass and volume with light and shade . By sketching areas of light and shadow , you can also develop the patterns in your landscape . <p> Initially , you will have to decide between painting a close-up of your subject or a vista , or something in between . Although it is ultimately a personal decision , sometimes location can dictate the type of composition used . If the land is flat , you will be able to see more of the sky and far into the distance . The high plateau desert of Santa Fe and northern New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect for painting vistas and skies . Back in Woodstock , New York , the general landscape was more hemmed in , allowing for more close-up views and fewer vistas , though vistas could certainly be found there . <p> Some artists , students , and collectors feel that a landscape is a vista by definition , but I find this to be a very restricting viewpoint , which should not be adopted by the plein air painter . The challenge of interpreting outdoor light conditions and color themes is present in both close-ups and vistas . For me , the light found outdoors makes an outdoor painting what it is . <p> Through composition , the artist tells the story of the subject in relation to the other objects in the painting . Begin a composition by dividing the painting surface into areas . Decide how much space to set aside for the sky and for the ground plane , especially for a vista . The line that separates the two is the horizon line . The position of the horizon line on a painting makes a big difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear to recede into the distance . In other words , the composition of the painting will appear to have greater depth . <p> If the ground plane makes up most of the painting , then focus on it . For the time being , leave the white of the paper to act as your sky , and begin to paint the darker colors of the ground plane and its fields , trees , houses , mountains , and so on , until they are well established . <p> Remember that you are interpreting a three-dimensional landscape on a flat surface . One way to approach composition is to break down a painting into its two-dimensional elements , which ultimately combine to create the sense of three-dimensional space . These elements are the shapes , patterns , and planes . Squinting your eyes helps you see your subject in two dimensions . It eliminates the surface details and groups together all the large shapes . Try to see the landscape in patterns of light and shadow . <p> Establish the largest shapes in the composition first , then the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and group together . Squint in order to see them more clearly . Follow this with adjacent shapes . You can use a single color to relate the shadow masses . I was taught to use raw umber to establish my drawing placement and shadow masses . Afterward , different colors can be painted into this single tone . Varying detail leaves something to the viewer 's imagination and leads the eye from specific areas to suggested areas . To keep the shapes unified , use colors that are similar in value , as illustrated by the distant mountains and foreground foliage in Tonto Wilderness . PATTERNS <p> Patterns suggest realism . They can also be used to express depth and movement . A pattern is a repetition of similar elements , such as diagonal , vertical , or horizontal lines . The shape of a single tree repeated to make a row of trees creates a pattern . There are also patterns of light and shade , and patterns created by repeating colors . For me , using patterns effectively is an important compositional element in realistic painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as realistic . PICTURE PLANES <p> The two-dimensional surface you work on consists of picture planes . These are different from the planes of an object . For example , a rock has a top plane and side planes , which give the object its form . Picture planes , on the other hand , help you to organize your painting . It 's a way of dividing and breaking up the space in a pleasing arrangement . <p> The picture planes of a composition show where objects exist in space . It is the plane on which all of the lines , shapes , patterns , movements , and so on , are planned . <p> Although a painting can have an infinite number of planes , it 's best to keep it simple . Most often , planes have shapes that are simplified and used in composition to create a sense of depth or distance . Sometimes , these shapes overlap ; sometimes , their direction can express the movement of the composition . In the later stages of painting , adding texture and color to planes creates variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as aerial perspective , can be applied to increase the sense of depth and atmosphere . <p> Picture planes and aerial perspective go hand in hand , since both show distance . As the picture plane recedes , you see less detail and more of simple shapes . For example , when painting a distant mountain plane , care must be taken to paint the shape of the mountain a lighter color . Lighter values and muted colors help show distance . On the other hand , to paint a field in the foreground plane , more details are added using more intense colors . <p> If the mountain were painted with a color that was too dark or too intense , then the picture plane of the mountains would come forward too much . <p> As I discussed earlier , it is best to establish a composition by starting with the largest shape . By the same token , I choose to work from the center of interest out . The largest shape usually represents the center of interest . By designing the rest of a painting around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> Be careful not to overstate unimportant elements , as this can weaken the impact you desire . If possible , try to put into the center of interest the lightest light and the darkest dark , the richest color and the sharpest edges , and the most interesting details . VIGNETTES <p> Painting from the center of interest out also gives you the choice of leaving the outer edges of a painting untouched , as with a vignette . A vignette is a painting in which only part of the subject is painted and the rest of the paper is left untouched . The tone of the paper becomes a background that can complement or contrast with the pastel colors . Artists usually choose to do vignettes when painting portraits . In plein air painting , a vignette can be painted as a study , as well as a final painting . <p> The text and illustrations in this article are excerpted with permission from Painting the Landscape in Pastel ( Watson-Guptill Publications , New York , New York ) . $21.95 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 x 15 .
