<p> Rocco Mediate walked out of the scoring hut behind the 18th green at Augusta National Golf Club late Sunday afternoon and shook hands with CBS 's Peter Kostis . <p> " Was it a record ? " he asked , referring to the 10 he had made nearly two hours earlier at the tiny but always treacherous par-3 12th hole . <p> Kostis shook his head . " Sorry , " he said . " The record 's 13 . " <p> Mediate smiled . " I was hoping , " he said , " to at least become part of Masters lore . " <p> For a long time Sunday , Mediate looked like he might become just that for a much different reason . <p> As he walked off the ninth green , his back , which has hampered his golf career for more than a decade , was giving him fits yet again , but he was tied for the lead at 4 under with playing partner Miguel Angel Jimenez and Phil Mickelson and Fred Couples , both playing the seventh hole at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could barely make it to the 10th tee , " Mediate said . " On the other hand , I really thought I was going to win the Masters . In my heart , at that moment , I thought I could suck it up for nine more holes and get it done . " <p> Mediate 's back troubles date from 1994 , when he had surgery for a ruptured disk . He has lost about 50 pounds since the surgery , but still struggles with back pain frequently . Sunday morning , finishing the third round , he felt his back go again when his foot slipped on his second shot to the 15th hole . He finished the round two shots behind Mickelson and went immediately to get some chiropractic treatment in the fitness trailer . He appeared to be limping early in the final round and , after starting with a bogey on the first hole , grabbed at his hip after his second shot to the par-5 second . <p> " Double whammy , " he said . " I felt something go in my hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain I could finish . But then things loosened up for a while . " <p> They loosened up enough that he was able to birdie Nos. 6 , 7 , and 8 to put himself back at the top of what was a very jumbled leader board at that point . Then came the ninth , one of Augusta 's sneakier holes . The drive is straight down a hill , and the second shot straight up a hill to a green that slopes devilishly from back to front . The Sunday pin is always near the front , meaning a player who lands above the hole faces a brutal downhill putt and one who lands hole high or lower will often spin off the green . <p> Mediate 's drive split the middle , and he decided to hit a hard 8-iron rather than an easy 7 . The shot made him nervous , not because of its difficulty but because of the lie . <p> " It was hanging , " Mediate said . " You get those on nine because you 're downhill so often . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I hit the ball , I felt the pain in my back , and I knew I 'd hit a perfect shot . " <p> The shot flew straight at the flag , hit the bottom of the flagstick and moved backward , rolling off the green . Mediate missed an eagle by perhaps three inches . Instead , he had to get a difficult up-and-down for par , which he managed . <p> " I felt tremendous at that moment , " he said . " I mean , excited . I thought I could deal with the pain and keep playing well for nine holes . I really did n't think it would stand me up . But it did . " <p> On the 12th tee , the pain in Mediate 's back stood him up . He had just bogeyed the 11th hole , missing the green to the right and then missing an eight-footer for par . Still , he was only two shots behind Mickelson and Couples at that moment and with Amen Corner still in front of the leaders , anything could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Sunday pin at the 12th is always to the right , just behind the bunker with very little margin for error if someone plays toward the flagstick . Most players opt to play left and try to land the ball safely on the green , make a 3 and run to the 13th tee . There were four birdies there Sunday . The hole is rife with history . In 1992 , Couples 's tee shot barely cleared Rae 's Creek and somehow stopped on the hill without rolling in the water . Mickelson hit his tee shot in the water in 1998 to take himself out of contention . Others have met disaster there through the years , most notably Tom Weiskopf , whose 13 in 1980 is , in fact , part of Masters lore . <p> The hole was playing 155 yards Sunday , and the players , as is always the case on Sunday , were playing from the left side of the tee . Mediate chose an 8-iron and played for the middle of the green . As soon as he began his downswing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut right through him , and the ball came off the club without the sort of loft one expects from an 8-iron . The ball landed just on the far side of the creek and spun back into the water as the huge crowd groaned . <p> " Basically , my back just went psycho on me there , " Mediate said . " When I tried to hit my first wedge , I swear I almost whiffed on it . " <p> Mediate 's first wedge shot from the drop area did n't make it halfway across the creek . His second wedge  --  he was now hitting 5  --  went a little bit farther but also failed to clear the water . Mediate was turning to get another ball before the shot splashed . He managed to get his third wedge  --  with a full swing  --  over the water and into the back bunker . He got onto the green from the bunker and two-putted from 20 feet . In a matter of minutes he had gone from a tie for third place and very much in contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to hide . <p> " To be honest , it kind of sucked , " he said , still trying to smile when he had finally finished with an 80 ( 34-46 ) which left him tied for 32nd place . " I might very well have played the best 71 holes of my life . I 'm really proud of the way I played and the way I hung in there . I just could n't do anything about it . This is n't new for me . I do n't know what is going to happen with it . I 'll have to see how it feels the next few days . " <p> Mediate , 43 , has had one of those might-have-been careers . He has won five times on tour but has often missed long stretches because of his back problems . Two years ago , he finished out of the top 125 on the money list , and last year he had to invoke an exemption granted because he was in the top 50 on the career money list . He made the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year entering the Masters . In fact , he had probably been interviewed more this year about his participation in last year 's World Series of Poker than about his golf . <p> " The back went on me again in December back home Naples , Fla. , and it 's been in and out since then , " he said . " I really thought I could pull this off until the 12th hole . After that , it was just a matter of finishing the golf tournament . If I 'd been someplace else , I might have walked in . Here , though , there was no way . I was going to finish if I had to crawl up the 18th . " He smiled . " I thought I might have to when I got there . " <p> As Jimenez was leaving , he stopped to shake hands with Mediate once again and handed him a cigar . <p> " You 're the best , " Mediate said . He stuck the cigar in his pocket . " I think I 'll smoke it later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the locker room and had one final thought . <p> " I guess what I did at 12 makes for a good story . " He smiled . " Of course , it was n't the story I had in mind . "
