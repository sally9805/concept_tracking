The sky was still dark , as it was every morning when Joanna Harrison began walking the two-mile route that serpentined through the development where she lived . The icy air hit her face , the only part of her uncovered , numbing her skin to a dull ache as she walked past massive houses majestically situated on two-acre lots . But unlike other mornings , she was n't thinking about her day at work , errands afterward , or her children thousands of miles away . She was seeing the weeks unfolding before her in her mind , and she shuddered , not from the cold , but because she knew everything was about to change . And she simply could n't do it again . <p> She 'd never been a fighter . Years ago , Joanna had learned it was better to keep her feelings under control . And resentments ? Well , growing up in her mother 's house , she 'd discovered how to keep them buried deep inside . The only problem she found was the occasional bout of breathlessness as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a voice struggling to be heard . As it did on that bitter morning in March . Just before dawn , as her sneakers hit the ground again and again with a soft crunching of frozen , dead leaves , following a routine she 'd clung to like a lifeline , that voice rose to the edge of Joanna Harrison 's consciousness like the quiet crackling of lake ice about to thaw . <p> Leave . <p> Pumping her arms , she picked up the pace , her sleep-stiff muscles finally warming up . She stopped briefly , bending her left leg a few times until the knee clicked into place . A little arthritis , the harbinger of middle age . She thought of Sharon and how they would have laughed over this . Sharon was the only real friend she 'd made when they moved to New Jersey three years ago . They had jokingly referred to each other as their " surrogate spouses , " going to soccer games and movies together while their husbands , more married to their careers , traveled the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her terribly . <p> The sun was just peeking over the barren hills to the east as she left the sidewalk and headed into the wooded trail that looped behind the houses . Within moments , pale winter sunlight flickered , illuminating the bare trees and the snow-splotched fields in the distance . A glimmer of something ignited inside of Joanna . It had been days since she 'd seen the sun , and she could not recall a winter as bitter or endless as this one . <p> The first snow had come before Halloween , a brief flash of white that was gone within hours as the warm earth soaked it up . By Christmas , life as she knew it had come to a virtual standstill under the weight of nearly thirty inches of powder . She 'd stood at the picture window , the cordless phone in her hand , waiting to hear from her children , stranded at different airports . The holiday she 'd waited for was cut to a frantic forty-eight-hour visit , as Sarah and Tim rushed back to their own busy lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone on another business trip . Life as she knew it had fallen back into its old routine . Now as she walked through the woods and the world came quietly back to life , longing for her children filled her with an ache . <p> Just leave . <p> She was a corporate wife , though . She was used to being alone . Corporate wives were like another breed of single parent . Joanna was always busy , and once the kids were gone , she 'd managed to fill the solitary hours with books and videos , or an occasional adult-ed class . In fact , it was the last course she took , in computers , just after moving to Sparta , that led to the job she now had at a local candy company . It was mindless work , punching data into a computer all day , surrounded by buckets of chocolates and the sickening aroma of cocoa beans roasting . Her career , really , had been her family . She did n't mind . As a motherless child , she wanted nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love and security she 'd never had . They 'd followed Paul on his transfers and promotions all over the country , moves that took him higher in the company , like a real-life game of Chutes and Ladders . In twenty-six years of marriage , they 'd moved more than a dozen times . As Paul kept scaling that corporate ladder , Joanna 's job was to keep the rest of the family from sliding down the chutes . <p> And now she and Paul would be moving again . <p> She thought about Paul 's big surprise last night . He had told her it was just a business dinner . She 'd stood in the atrium of V.I.C . ' s northeast headquarters , just forty minutes from their home , in front of the large crowd of coworkers and even some of Paul 's clients . Ted , Paul 's boss and friend , saluted him for his hard work and sacrifice . And then with great fanfare , Ted announced that Paul was the new vice president of national sales . Cheers erupted and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkled in the trees , a fountain roared , and then her husband 's voice began to fill the atrium with thanks and praise for his company . It was as if his words , echoing off the rising the walls , had lifted her up , high above the room . She 'd watched it all , like a spectator floating above the crowd , and saw the other Joanna far below , smiling , clapping , operating on automatic pilot . After the applause , as Paul walked toward her , she 'd plummeted back to earth , breathless . I ca n't do this again , she 'd thought . Because she knew what would come next : another house , another town ; Paul would be away even more . And she would know no one . <p> And then she 'd begun to hyperventilate . The breath left her lungs as quickly as if it had been sucked out by a vacuum . And she could n't seem to pull another breath in . She was going to cause a scene . Turning to escape to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand gripping her arm . She turned back and there was Paul , beaming . He must have seen the panic in her eyes because suddenly he pulled her to him and kissed her hard . As the crowd cheered , he whispered in her ear , " I need you here right now , Joanna . " <p> And then they were off , working the room , her husband accepting handshakes and backslaps of congratulations , as she was pulled along beside him . <p> Now she looked up as a low-flying plane droned through the quiet morning . Through the leafless treetops she saw a jet heading west across the brightening sky and wondered if it was her husband 's plane . She remembered Paul telling her he could see their neighborhood on this flight path . She imagined him up there , sitting in business class , his laptop opened , his mind already geared for the meeting he 'd be having in California , in spite of their late night . He would be gone for a week or more , again . Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet below ? Was she anything to him or those he worked with , other than Paul 's wife ? <p> As she left the woods , crossing the cul-de-sac behind her house , the newly risen sun flashed off the windows of the houses facing east . Cars sat warming in a few driveways , their exhausts billowing great puffs of steam on this frigid morning . In an hour and fifteen minutes she would be at work , sitting in her cubicle , a poster of Monet 's water lilies staring at her from one carpeted wall , pictures of her children at various ages smiling on her from another . After eight hours , she would come home to an empty house , hit the answering machine , and pour a glass of wine as she listened to the endless beeps from endless telemarketers or Gabrielle , their errant cleaning lady , with another excuse . She would turn on the television for company as she ate dinner alone . And tomorrow it would all begin again . <p> Or would it ? <p> As Joanna walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " I 'll leave , " she said out loud , as she opened the front door . <p> SHE DROVE LIKE AN AUTOMATON , her mind frozen to thought . Before she knew it , a hundred , then two hundred miles went by . By noon she was on Route 95 South , somewhere in Virginia , and the wall of brown woods that lined the roadside began to soften with new leaf buds . Soon it stretched solid and green . Then there was the first purple splash of wisteria , just before the North Carolina border . At the Welcome Center , where she stopped briefly to pick up a map , yellow daffodils smiled up at her . As she walked back to the car , a silky wind brushed her face , softer and sweeter than she 'd felt in a long time . <p> A short while later , her mood began to sink with the sun . As she followed a detour on a flat , winding back road , dusk settled and lights clicked on in the little houses she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as families came together for dinner . She felt so utterly alone . A lump of grief swelled in her throat , cutting off her breath , and she veered into a diner parking lot . Frantically , she dumped the remains of her lunch from a McDonald 's bag and pulled it to her lips , breathing into it slowly , again and again . <p> Twelve hours after driving away from her home in New Jersey , Joanna pulled into a motel off Route 95 , just before the South Carolina border . Her entire body trembled with exhaustion . Never in her life had she driven alone so long or so far . Hunching her shoulders , she stretched her aching arms high overhead , loosening the muscles in her stiff back . Then she squatted a few times , bending her legs until her knee clicked into place . <p> She 'd never stayed in a motel alone before , and was a little nervous . She took a room near the lobby with an inside corridor . It was stale and airless , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dropping her bag on the floor , she collapsed on the bed and closed her eyes . The room began to spin and she felt slightly nauseous . Oh God , what had she done ? This was insane . She had no real plan . She was simply driving to Pawleys Island . She 'd told herself that morning , as she got in the car and a moment of panic seized her , that she 'd figure the rest out when she got there . <p> She got up and tore the wrapper off a plastic bathroom cup and poured herself a brandy from the small bottle she 'd stuffed into her suitcase . Pulling that first sip to her mouth , hands shaking so that the golden liquid trembled in the cup , she thought of her mother for an instant and stopped , picturing the coffee cup that had never left her side . Her mother had fooled no one . Joanna swallowed a big sip , nearly choking as the brandy scorched a fiery trail in her chest that burned even after it was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then she took a hot bath , settling into the shallow tub with a moan of pleasure . After the bath , she poured another brandy , and lay on the bed and turned on the TV looking for the Weather Channel . She had just a few hours driving left in the morning . The weather map for the west lit up the screen instead , forecasting snow up and down the Rockies . She imagined Sarah , up early to clean off her car , wearing some stylish , impractical shoes and no hat , and then driving to her job at the art gallery in Denver . Timmy would probably cram in a few hours of snowboarding between classes , one of the perks of going to college in Montana . She took another swallow of brandy . God , how she missed them . What would they think when they found out she 'd left ? She wondered if Paul knew yet . <p> When she was closing the door for the last time that morning , she 'd stopped , realizing she 'd left no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul would n't be home for days . The note would sit on the counter untouched . So she went in and picked up the phone and left him a voice mail at work , as she 'd done earlier with her boss when she quit her job . I 'm leaving , she 'd told her husband . I 've been lonely and unhappy for a long time . Shame crawled up her skin like a slow heat as she imagined him hearing those words , sounding so banal and ridiculous now . <p> Joanna got up from the bed and made her way unsteadily to the door and slid the chain across . Then she turned on the bathroom light , leaving the door cracked , and turned off the rest of the lights as she made her way back to the bed . The motel room flickered with the blue light of the mute TV and she reached for a pillow , burying her face , catching the clean scent of bleach just before she muffled the first sob . She was leaving everything she 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland , driving over the small causeway that separated Pawleys Island from the rest of the world , hope washed over Joanna . She saw splashes of snowy white in the wide carpet of green marsh , where egrets nudged in the mudflats for food . A heron lifted suddenly and her eyes followed it up to blue sky , vast bright stretches of it into the flat distance , across the island and to the sea . On the bridge , crabbers dropped their cages over the sides , and she felt as if she were entering another world . A slower place where life is simpler and days revolve around the tides and weather . A three-mile spit of sand , just a half mile at its widest , Pawleys Island was home to nothing but dunes , houses , and beach . Old-timers had wisely kept the hands of developers off the island so it was not marred by hotels or high-rises . Midway up the island sat a cluster of historic homes with low cedar roofs , dense shrubs , and old plantation-style porches that overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the historic markers and got out of the car . Surrounded by green marsh glittering in the sunshine , she took a deep breath of salty air and relief flooded through her . This was how it looked and this was how she 'd felt years ago when she 'd first seen it . She was right to come here . <p> It had been ten years ago , maybe more , when Paul had taken her and the kids to Myrtle Beach for the Easter break . The kids , teenagers then , were bored , and each day was a struggle to find some common ground . Finally on the last day , Paul announced he was going golfing . The kids wanted to go to the Pavilion for the rides and games , alone . Joanna took the car and went exploring , heading for Brookgreen Gardens , but passing it somehow and then seeing the sign for Pawleys Island . She 'd turned off Route 17 , and minutes later , the world opened up before her-marsh , sea , and sky . The same feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a simple place to live . <p> Getting back in the car now , she followed the single road on the island south to its end and pulled into a sandy parking area . It was late morning , just two hours since she 'd left the motel in North Carolina . She got out of the car , followed a boardwalk around a dune , and suddenly the ocean was rolling and shimmering in front of her . A channel that separated Pawleys from the next tiny island washed beside and behind her in a gush of green water as it carried the tide into the marsh . She was nearly surrounded with water . For the first time in a long , long time , real joy bubbled up inside Joanna . Perhaps , she thought , it would all be okay . <p> JOANNA CHECKED INTO the small Holiday Inn Express out on Route 17 , and early the next morning , and each thereafter , she was back on the beach , walking and planning her day . And before she knew it , a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although she was no closer to a new life . After her walk , she 'd go back to the motel , heat something in the microwave , shower , and dress . Then she would go to the library . <p> It was nearly impossible for Joanna to enter a library and not think about her childhood . The library had been a sanctuary for her , surrounded by stillness and calm in the after-school hours when her mother had already spent too many hours battling the bottle . Away from her mother 's sharp tongue , she would lose herself in books that would take her away to other places , other lives , and for a while she lived vicariously , imagining she was Nancy Drew , pretty and popular , with a dead mother , a fabulous father , and a housekeeper who doted on her . The summer between fifth and sixth grades she 'd read the entire series , a book a day , practically living at the library . Or occasionally taking her book to the Sand Bar , the local beach on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , reading under a tree far from the laughing families . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
