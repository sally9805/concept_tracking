WHEN I WAS THOROUGHLY ELEVEN , WORKING ON TWELVE , I first met you . You were not part of the gang that beat me up , but you watched them do it . That was the first and only thing I knew about you for the longest time : you liked to watch . Of course you also liked to listen ; did you hear it when the bone snapped in my arm ? I did . And that was when I suddenly knew you were there . Probably , without even knowing it , I had been waiting for you a very long time . Now that you were there , I was tempted to introduce my tormentors . I may as well . That was Sugrue " Sog " Alan who slammed the baseball bat down on my arm ; Sog was not yet seventeen , too young to be drafted or even to join with his parents ' permission , but he was big enough , tough enough , not to have needed the baseball bat ; he could 've broken my arm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy , Larry Duckworth , was only fifteen , but already the handsomest man in Stay More since all the best-looking ones had been drafted or joined up . Maybe Larry was vain and even jealous of my nice face , for he chose not to break my arm but to blacken one of my eyes . The only one of them that I might have beaten in a fair fight was Jim John Whitter , who spelled it Witter and maybe was right but whose stupidity kept him a year behind me in school although he was a year older than me . He took advantage of how the other two had already defeated me to do something he could n't have done alone : kick me in the groin . I wondered if you could even imagine how that felt . You looked the three of them over and betrayed no disdain , though I am trying to picture them for you as villains , which they were . Then you looked at me , on the ground , whimpering in pain and grunting not your name , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernie Pyle , my hero . If Ernie could have come to my cries , even though he was frail and scrawny , he could have trounced all three of them together , he could have obliterated them , with his words , if not his fists . But he did n't come . You did . I liked to think that you felt sympathy for me , if not much knowledge , certainly not yet any affection . I was n't fishing for your pity , nor did I hope you could rescue me , as I had prayed for Ernie 's aid . I was n't even , as some would argue , simply imagining you out of the desperation of the situation . You were there , as much as I am here . You could n't do anything . You could n't protect me from those bullies , but you could , and you did , give me to know that you were there . That would sustain me for ... a long time ( I nearly said forever , but neither you nor I believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the plaster cast on my arm . " Can you get out that newspaper of yours with only one hand ? " Doc asked me . Sure , I said ; it was my good arm , the right one , that peeled the pages from the press . He shook his head . " Who was it got on the wrong side of you , boy ? " he asked me . I winked at you and grinned manfully . " Oh , just some of them , " I said . I was n't going to name any names , except to you . " Well , if they were out to kill ye , they did a right poor job of it , " he said . " I reckon you 'll live . But I was you , I 'd cross the creek without a footbridge next time I seen them a-coming . " When I was not yet six and had just the faintest idea who you were , not enough to keep me from it , I had run away from home and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Doc Swain had organized the search party -- the entire populace , some hundred-odd Stay Morons -- but he had not been the one who had found me , and I suppose it had frustrated him . Now that I come to think of it , now that I 'd met you and had you beside me , now that I 'd speculated interminably about just who it was who 'd found me , I can only wonder : was it you ? During the exciting days following our first meeting ( I was thrilled to see how readily and easily and cozily you shared my bed at night ) , I searched in vain for a good name for you . At school , the little one-room ( white , not red ) schoolhouse across Swains Creek from the village , I had sat alone since August at a desk meant for two . I did n't have infectious cooties , not that I knew of , and I did n't have B.O. , not that anybody had ever told me , and I was n't the only fifth grader : Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit with me , or , rather , I did n't want to sit with him , and he knew it . The only advantage of sitting alone was that during air-raid drills when we all had to get down under our desks , it was easier for me to get under the desk without bumping into and getting tangled up with a deskmate . Air-raid drills were ridiculous ; we had never seen an airplane . Maybe Miss Jerram , a pretty but not terribly bright spinster of twenty-three or thirty-three ( who could tell ? and besides , any unmarried woman past nineteen was considered a spinster ) had not assigned me a seatmate out of spite , because she knew I was smarter than she was . But now I could install you to share my desk , calling you , for want of a better name , Friend . Some of the other kids launched admiring glances at the white plaster cast on my arm , which would soon bear their inscriptions of good wishes , all of them except Sog 's , Larry 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Miss Jerram said , that first day afterwards , " Dawny , do you want to stand and tell us all what-all happened to ye ? " I turned to my new seatmate and said to you , " Friend , why do n't you tell ' em ? " But of course you would not , or could not . It was Jim John across the aisle who blurted , bragging , " That stinkin Jap done went and told on us in that stupid newspaper of his'n , and we whomped the soup outen him ! " Did Miss Jerram understand that ? She could not permit herself to believe that I was smart enough to be a newspaper editor , and therefore she refrained from reading my paper . Or if she snuck a glance at it she never told me . But she knew darn well that most of the student body had been divided , for going on four years , practically since the war started , into two factions , rival camps who opposed each other not only in baseball but in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capture the Flag . With or without her knowledge and consent , these two factions occupied opposing sides of the schoolroom with the aisle as a divider , a demilitarized zone across which spitballs flew . There were the top dogs , led by fat Burl Coe until he got drafted and by Sog Alan in his absence , who called themselves Allies , from the privilege of feeling and sometimes being superior ( most of them came from the " better " families of town , to the extent that the farms in the bottomlands were more productive than those on the mountains ) , and there were the underdogs , who did not choose to be called Axis but had no choice . I certainly did not elect to be an Axis , let alone a despised Jap , but it fell my lot by default . Most of the girls , except a few chosen as sweethearts or sycophants by the Allied generals , were also Axis by default . Before the war , we Axis had been required to be the redskins in games of cowboys-and-Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the bad guy . They were the in-group ; we were the out-group . Whether one was Ally or Axis had nothing to do with how dumb or smart one was , or even social status as such ( in Stay More there were only two social classes anyhow , with hardly any distinction between them : the poor , and the dirt poor -- or , from a different perspective , since none of us were starving and all of us were fairly happy , the rich , and the feeling-rich ) . And just as the Civil War had pitted brother against brother ( including two historically famous brothers from Stay More ) , opposing members of the Allies and the Axis could be found in the same family . For example , early in the war years , when the sides were first drawn , there were the triplet sons , Earl , Burl , and Gerald , of Lawlor Coe , the blacksmith , who , before Miss Jerram organized her War Effort Scrap Drive to remove all of it , had an abundance of waste pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Axis fashioned their arsenals . Burl was the dominant triplet and thus insisted on being an Allied general , leaving his brothers to be the Axis : Earl the Nazi and Gerald the Jap . Dulcie Coe , the triplets ' mother , had given Burl 's tousled auburn locks a GI haircut at his request , had slicked and combed Earl 's hair into a Hitlerian flap , which he darkened with stove polish , adding a false mustache of horsehair , and she had made Gerald 's head look like a parody of the caricatures of Premier Hideki Tojo ; when Gerald 's efforts to give himself buckteeth by gripping his lower lip with his upper teeth did not do the job , his friends -- two of us -- fashioned him a false set from a dead cow 's teeth . The two friends of Gerald , including me , empathized with him by wearing cow 's teeth also during the battles , or even by slanting up the corners of our eyes with charcoal . The other friend was Willard Dinsmore , the smartest of us all , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games requiring strategy , intelligence , and cunning , especially with the brawn provided by our Nazi conspirators , the Axis often routed the Allies . Before long , I 'll introduce you to Willard , and I think you may like him best of us all . But for now , and for a while , it 's Gerald we 're looking at : pudgy , freckled , towheaded , the least and last of three insufferably identical and homely brothers whose names , you are quick to understand , rhymed , the way we all pronounced his as " Jerl . " But no one except his mother called him that . Nearly everyone had a nickname of sorts , as if it were bad luck to speak someone 's actual name . Even their pronunciation of my diminutive , " Dawny , " turned it into a kind of nickname , but ever since the war started all of the Axis and the Allies called me Ernie rather than Dawny because I had once in a moment of extravagance or enthusiasm blurted that I thought Ernie Pyle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald Coe had once blurted that his ambition in life was someday to become mayor of Stay More . This little town , lost as it was in the remote fastnesses of the Ozark Mountains , had never had a mayor , unless you considered that in the old days , more than a century before , Jacob Ingledew , who 'd founded the town with his brother Noah , had proclaimed himself Mayor , mostly just an honorific title . Being least and last always makes one a little more alert and sensitive than those who are first and foremost , and Gerald , or " Mayor Coe " as others began to call him in jest , perceived that Stay More might not continue its relentless decline and population loss if there was a responsible civic government to rescue it . Those who truly knew him , as few did ( you and I among them ) , had every reason to believe that he might actually run for and be elected to the post someday , and , further , that he might actually save the dying town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that is what we all of us had come to call him , Mare Coe , a name that lent itself to further teasing ( a nickname is by virtue of its bestowal a form of teasing ) because of the association with female horses or nightmares or , as Sog Alan usually called him , Mary . Taunts could be easily made : " Mare smokes marijuana , " or " Stay Mare of Stay More , " and , prophetically , Mare would join the marines . Despite his pudginess and his flaring freckles and the anonymity that comes from being identical to two nondescript brothers , Mare had qualities that not only made him the natural commander of the Axis but also , had he lived long enough , might actually have elevated him to mayor of what was left of the community of Stay More . He was smarter than his brothers . Until he graduated from the eighth grade at fourteen , he was Miss Jerram 's star pupil , her pet , and ( some of the kids gossiped ) her secret lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them ( and nobody ever testified the two had ever been seen together outside of school ) , it is a fact that she was the only one who could distinguish him readily from his brothers . The triplets not only looked exactly alike ( they did n't dress identically but wore an indistinguishable wardrobe of overalls and old shirts ) but also talked identically , with the same inflections and only the subtlest differences in their choice of words , which did not escape Miss Jerram 's keen perception : she knew , for example , that Mare 's favorite negative was " Over my dead body , " and his favorite affirmative was " Fine and dandy , " and she smiled at him more often than she did at his brothers . Because she was nice to him , he went out of his way to please her , and even after he 'd graduated he helped her conduct that great award-winning scrap drive and that great knit-off . Paradoxically , as far as the War Effort was concerned , the members of the Axis were much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , I was still in the second grade , and a Red Cross lady came from the county seat , Jasper , to show all of us , including Miss Jerram , who did n't know how , the art of knitting . We learned how to click those needles and loop those skeins for Our Boys Overseas . Soon all of us -- except the Allies , who thought it was sissy , and refused -- were adept at making knitted squares out of the khaki or olive drab yarn from the wool from the sheep of Stay More that had been dyed in advance . When enough squares were finished , they 'd be stitched together into blankets , and although these blankets disappeared we 'd be told how they 'd become part of " Bundles for Britain " and thus warming and comforting to Our Boys Overseas . The Axis girls , like Ella Jean Dinsmore , whom I secretly was crazy about from the second grade on , graduated from doing simple wool squares to knitting mittens , socks , and even sweaters for Our Boys Overseas , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the Newton County prize for Most Yarn Intertwined , a certificate that Miss Jerram dressed up with a frame trimmed with knitting and hung over the blackboard . We did even better for her War Effort Scrap Drive , rounding up virtually everything metallic in the whole town , whether it was scrap or not . Mare Coe drove the hay wagon and mule team we used to load up with the collection -- wagon-wheel rims , hoes , plow points , broken anvils , shovels , everything . We asked him , " What iffen they 're still a-using whatever piece of metal we want ? " and he replied , " Jist ast ' em if they kin someways live without it . " Somehow we talked the few remaining menfolk out of their hammers , saws , and plowshares , the womenfolk out of their washtubs , pots , pans , and tableware , and all of the children sacrificed their jumping jacks , pocketknives , and any other play-pretties made out of metal . Doc Swain was permitted to keep his essential medical tools , but everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of our efforts , it was declared that we 'd collected more scrap than any other rural school in the whole state of Arkansas , and Miss Jerram got the privilege of christening in absentia a liberty ship . Doing things for the War Effort diverted us Axis from our constant battles with the Allies , and allowed us to feel truly superior to the Allies , who remained more interested in games and dirty tricks than in the patriotic activities of the War Effort . The Allies had commandeered as their clubhouse ( " Operations Headquarters " they called it ) an old house built up in a tree nearly a century before by Noah Ingledew . It could n't exactly be called a " tree house " because that conjures up an image of a jerry-built hovel constructed by children , and Noah Ingledew 's house had been an entire double-wing dwelling erected high up in a sycamore tree . The Allies always got the best of everything , and we Axis were consigned to using as our Operations Headquarters an unused back room in the old Ingledew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies ' clubhouse in that sycamore tree was just north of the village , and they had dug foxholes all around the perimeter of it to protect it , and not even Mare Coe could lead a successful assault on those foxholes . Whenever we played War , the Axis usually had to defend the village proper , the main street along which we 'd dug so many foxholes that the grown-ups complained . The Allies were usually victorious in assaulting and taking the village from us . The only times we truly beat the Allies were Saturday afternoon baseball games . With Mare 's help as pitcher , our Axis baseball team could sometimes beat the Allies , who always after a defeat vowed to get even in the trenches , but even there , hurling the old potatoes that we used as hand grenades , Mare could often defend us against the assault of the Allies . The Allies would rather play any sort of game than expend energy on behalf of Our Boys Overseas . The only thing the Allies were willing to do to help the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive for that : it was a way to get into the movies . As his own contribution to the War Effort , Doc Swain offered to take whoever could collect a lard bucket of grease to the Saturday night movies at the only movie theater in Newton County , the Buffalo , on the square in Jasper . The Buffalo was our Rialto . Doc not only was one of the few people in Stay More who possessed an automobile , but also because he was a doctor he had a " C " sticker for it that permitted him to fill his tank at Dill 's Gas and Service . During the war there was a national speed limit of thirty-five miles per hour , and on the dirt road between Parthenon and Jasper there was one little level straightaway , where , if Doc floored the gas pedal on his old heap , he could get it up to thirty-three or thirty-four mph , almost the speed limit . Each Saturday night Doc took the winners of the grease-collection contest the distance of more than ten miles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids was a lard-bucket of grease , meaning usually bacon fat or pork renderings . Often I was in the group of kids who crowded into Doc Swain 's car with their grease buckets , and I got to watch the Movietone News before the serial and the feature came on . That newsreel was always full of the latest thrilling shots of how we were winning the war in Germany and the Pacific . And I decided , for the benefit of all of those in Stay More who could n't go to the movies , to start a newspaper reporting the leading items from the Movietone News . Naturally my main motive was to start giving myself the experience I 'd need to replace Ernie Pyle when he retired . I mail-ordered for $1.98 plus postage ( earned from my after-school job as stockboy and general factotum at Latha Bourne 's general store ) a " hectograph , " or gelatin board , which was a simple wooden tray filled with hard purple gelatin on which a master sheet ( hand-printed with purple pencil ) could be impressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My little newspaper , never running to more than four pages except at Christmas , had reached a circulation of not more than forty at the time I met you . I had decided to call it The Stay Morning Star , a clever play on the town 's name . Putting out the newspaper required me to get up before school every Monday and , after giving postmistress Latha Bourne twenty copies to put in the post office boxes , carry the other twenty around to the RFD mailboxes of those who did n't have post office boxes . It was a long hike , up hill and down vale , in bitter weather that past winter , and sometimes I was tardy for the beginning of school and caught what-for from Miss Jerram . Then on Sunday afternoons I had to hike around to each of those places again and , after being announced by their barking dogs or knocking on their doors , I inquired whether any of them had anything to say that was worthy of being reported in the next day 's paper . On these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the Butterchurn Holler road , occupied by the strange bearded old man known only as Dan . I was n't afraid of him , as most of both the Allies and Axis were . His house was n't scary ; in fact , it was quite pleasant and , being painted yellow , was bright and cheerful . But somehow I sensed , or knew , or had once been told , that he did not want visitors , or company , or friends . Although he 'd been there longer than I 'd been alive , he was still a " furriner , " meaning not a native of these here mountains . He lived there with a girl , presumed to be his daughter , who was never seen in the village , who had never attended the Stay More school , who was reputed to be beautiful by those who claimed to have caught a glimpse of her . I left my little newspaper in their box each Monday morning , but I never even thought of stopping there on Sunday afternoons to ask for news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they possibly have anyhow ? For that matter , few others had any news . The most common thing I heard , after all the effort to reach some of those remote cabins and houses , was " Nothin this week , Dawny , sorry to have to tell ye . " But occasionally , like fishing for hours without a nibble and then landing a lunker , I got something truly newsworthy : a son had been in the D-Day invasion and survived . A son had been killed on his ship in the Pacific by something called a kamikaze , fiendish , which is where a pilot dive-bombs his plane with himself still in it . A son had been in something called the Battle of the Bulge and was wounded . I reported all of this excitement in a style that Ernie Pyle would have admired , even if he 'd have grinned at the way I imitated him . My stories never gave away any troop movements or sank any ships . But usually my reportage was mild and limited to such things as sports ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , the main source of news , visits . Sunday afternoons , the time of my news collecting , were by tradition the time of the week for people to visit one another , and I could usually fill a page with items like WHITTERS VISIT DUCKWORTHS , COES VISIT DILLS , or DINSMORES VISIT DINGLETOONS . But one of the " visits , " I discovered , involved a man too old to serve with Our Boys Overseas who was visiting with a young woman whose husband was one of Our Boys Overseas . " She 's jist my little niece , did n't ye know ? " he said to me , and I reported that fact in my story about the visit , which , however , got me into trouble . When I was hurt and puzzled by the uproar , dear Latha Bourne tried to explain to me , " He 's not really her uncle . They 're not even any kin to each other , which is unusual for any two people in this town . " The small costs of putting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short supply ) were borne by the advertisers : Latha Bourne 's General Store ( " Limited Supply of Post Toasties Just In " ) , Dill 's Gas and Service ( " Three Shade Trees , No Waiting " ) , and even now and again ( although I later learned the AMA would n't have approved ) Doc Swain ( " Come in and ask about what streptomycin can do for you " ) . I was still in love with Latha Bourne , which is what people kept on calling her although she was now Mrs. Every Dill , but I never made a nuisance of myself around her anymore ; I worked as her stockboy , janitor , and delivery boy for a little while after school each day , and once a week I took down her dictation for her ad in my paper , for which she paid me another fifteen or twenty-five cents , depending on whether it was a full-page ad or just a half-pager , although I protested that I could just consider those ad costs the rent on the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my newspaper office . No one , least of all myself , considered my newspaper to be in competition with the county 's weekly , published in Jasper and printed on a real press , which came out on Thursday afternoons and , to my pleasure , always carried the Scripps-Howard syndicated column of Ernie Pyle , which I read religiously . Ernie Pyle was my first experience of the writer whose life is almost as important as his work , and therefore an inspiration to become a writer , not just to entertain or inform people , not just to reach you , but to be admired as a writer . Ernie was just an old Indiana farm boy ; like myself , he had been put to the plow at the age of nine , and like myself he had hated it . Now he was on the front lines , living and sweating with the troops , dodging enemy fire , risking his life to report in his homespun , folksy style the doings and dreams and daring of the enlisted men . He made heroes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed by their hometowns , even their street addresses , and I always watched closely to see which ones were from Arkansas . The very week after the Allies broke my arm , he wrote about some of the boys in Ordnance over in France ( Ordnance is a branch of the Army , not a town in France ) , " The soldiers did a lot of kidding as they sat around taking rusted guns apart . Like soldiers everywhere they razzed each other constantly about their home states . A couple were from Arkansas , and of course they took a lot of hillbilly razzing about not wearing shoes till they got in the Army , and so on . One of them was Corporal Herschel Grimsley , of Springdale , Arkansas . He jokingly asked if I 'd put his name in my dispatch . So I took a chance and joked back . Sure , ' I said , except I did n't know anybody in Arkansas could read . ' " Gentle Reader , everybody laughed loudly at this scintillating wit , most of all Corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a revelation , in more ways than one . It let me know , for the first time in my life , that the rest of the world thought there was something wrong with the fact that we preferred to go barefooted in Stay More , not that we did n't know what shoes are , but because we did n't need ' em . And there were some of my subscribers who could n't read The Stay Morning Star because they never needed to learn how . But the main revelation of that column , startling me , was that it gave you a name . Gentle Reader . I had been calling you " Friend " just as a temporary handle until I found a better one . With Doc Swain and the others I had recently seen a movie at the Buffalo called The Thief of Bagdad , one of the ever-popular Arabian Nights films , and it had a fabulous genie in it , and I thought of calling you Genie , but there were a couple things wrong with that : a genie does one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( even though I 'll try to make you , farther along ) ; and Ella Jean Dinsmore , my secret passion , sometimes was called " Jeaner " or sometimes just " Jeannie , " which sounds just like Genie . So I had to give up that notion . Gentle Reader , that would do just fine , and it would be many more years before I discovered to my dismay how promiscuous you are , reading not just me and Ernie Pyle but everybody else . Still , I 'll always like to remember my first meeting of you , and my first discovery of your name . So when everyone in school , including Miss Jerram herself , was given the opportunity to inscribe my plaster cast , I remembered you . Most of them just wrote their names , or some stupid silly little thing like " Roses are red , Violets are blue ... " or added clever variations , " ... Sugar is sweet , but you stink ha ha ! " Lack of originality was rampant : " When you get married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggie does Jiggs " or " Yours till the Statue of Liberty sits down and the ocean wears rubber pants to keep its bottom dry . " Some were threatening : " Your leg next time , " wrote Sog Alan , " Dry up and blow away , " wrote Larry Duckworth , and " Go climb a weed , " wrote Jim John Whitter . Miss Jerram wrote " Here 's hoping someday you 'll discover that others are n't as dumb as you think they are . " Ella Jean had little to say , but it was sweet : " Hope you go far with the Stay Morning-star . " There were twenty-five people in the schoolhouse and their writings nearly covered my plaster cast , but I was careful to reserve one corner , where I put a dotted line . The expression " dotted line " is n't quite accurate , because usually the line is dashed , not dotted . But it was for you , Gentle Reader :  - -   - -  -   - -   - -   - -   - -    - -   - -   - -   - -  -              @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
