<p> Kill Bill Vol. 2 ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> The Bride Uma Thurman <p> Bill David Carradine <p> Elle Driver Daryl Hannah <p> Budd Michael Madsen <p> Pai Mei Gordon Liu <p> Esteban/Earl Michael Parks <p> Organ Player Samuel L. Jackson <p> Rev. Harmony Bo Svenson <p> Miramax Films presents a film directed by Quentin Tarantino . Written by Tarantino and Uma Thurman . Running time : 136 minutes . Rated R ( for violence , language and brief drug use ) . Opening today at local theaters . <p> Quentin Tarantino 's " Kill Bill Vol. 2 " is an exuberant celebration of moviemaking , coasting with heedless joy from one audacious chapter to another , working as irony , working as satire , working as drama , working as pure action . I liked it even more than " Kill Bill , Vol. 1 " ( 2003 ) . It 's not a sequel but a continuation and completion , filmed at the same time ; now that we know the whole story , the first part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own , although it has deeper resonance if you 've seen " Kill Bill , " just released on video . <p> The movie is a distillation of the countless grind house kung-fu movies Tarantino has absorbed , and which he loves beyond all reason . Web sites have already enumerated his inspirations  --  how a sunset came from this , and a sword from that . He is n't copying , but transcending ; there 's a kind of urgency in the film , as if he 's turning up the heat under his memories . <p> The movie opens with a long closeup of The Bride ( Uma Thurman ) behind the wheel of a car , explaining her mission , which is to kill Bill . There is a lot of explaining in the film ; Tarantino writes dialogue with quirky details that suggest the obsessions of his people . That 's one of the ways he gives his movies a mythical quality ; the characters do n't talk in mundane everyday dialogue , but in a kind of elevated geekspeak that lovingly burnishes the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Flashbacks remind us that the pregnant Bride and her entire wedding party were targeted by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in a massacre at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel . Bill was responsible  --  Bill , who she confronts on the porch of the chapel for a conversation that suggests the depth and weirdness of their association . He 's played by David Carradine in a performance that somehow , improbably , suggests that Bill and the Bride had a real relationship despite the preposterous details surrounding it . ( Bill is deeply offended that she plans to marry a used record store owner and lead a normal life . ) <p> The Bride of course improbably survived the massacre , awakened after a long coma , and in the first film set to avenge herself against the Deadly Vipers and Bill . That involved extended action sequences as she battled Vernita Green ( Vivica A. Fox ) and O-Ren Ishii ( Lucy Liu ) , not to mention O-Ren 's teenage bodyguard Go-Go Yubari ( Chiaki Kuriyama ) and the martial arts killer team known as the Crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to persuade the legendary swordmaker Hattori Hanzo ( Sonny Chiba ) to come out of retirement and make her a weapon . He presented it without modesty : " This my finest sword . If in your journey you should encounter God , God will be cut . " <p> In " Vol. 2 , " she meets another Asian legend , the warrior master Pai Mei , played by Gordon Liu . Pai Mei , who lives on the top of a high , lonely hill reached by climbing many stairs , was Bill 's master , and in a flashback , Bill delivers his protege for training . Pai Mei is a harsh and uncompromising teacher , and the Bride ( whose real name , by the way , is Beatrix Kiddo ) sheds blood during their unrelenting sessions . <p> Pai Mei , whose hair and beard are long and white and flowing , like a character from the pages of a comic book , is another example of Tarantino 's method , which is to create lovingly structured episodes that play on their own while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , ancient and deadly martial arts masters in countless earlier movies , Pai Mei waits patiently for eons on his hilltop until he is needed for a movie . <p> The training with Pai Mei , we learn , prepared The Bride to begin her career with Bill ( " jetting around the world making vast sums of money and killing for hire " ) , and is inserted in this movie at a time and place that makes it function like a classic cliffhanger . In setting up this scene , Tarantino once again pauses for colorful dialogue ; The Bride is informed by Bill that Pai Mei hates women , whites and Americans , and much of his legend is described . Such speeches function in Tarantino not as long-winded detours , but as a way of setting up characters and situations with dimensions it would be difficult to establish dramatically . <p> In the action that takes place " now , " The Bride has to fight her way past formidable opponents , including Elle Driver ( Daryl Hannah ) , the one-eyed master of martial arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer-swilling brother , who works as a bouncer in a strip joint and lives in a mobile home surrounded by desolation . Neither one is a pushover for The Bride  --  Elle because of her skills ( also learned from Pai Mei ) , Budd because of his canny instincts . <p> The showdown with Budd involves a sequence where it seems The Bride must surely die after being buried alive . ( That she does not is a given , considering the movie is not over and Bill is not dead , but she sure looks doomed . ) Tarantino , who began the film in black and white before switching to color , plays with formats here , too ; to suggest the claustrophobia of being buried , he shows The Bride inside her wooden casket , and as clods of earth rain down on the lid , he switches from widescreen to the classic 4x3 screen ratio . <p> The fight with Elle Driver is a virtuoso celebration of fight choreography ; although we are aware that all is not as it seems in movie action sequences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even seem to do what they do . Their battle takes place inside Budd 's trailer home , which is pretty much demolished in the process , and provides a contrast to the elegant nightclub setting of the fight with O-Ren Ishii ; it ends in a squishy way that would be unsettling in another kind of movie , but here all the action is so ironically heightened that we may cringe and laugh at the same time . <p> These sequences involve their own Tarantinian dialogue of explanation and scene-setting . Budd has an extended monologue in which he offers The Bride the choice of Mace and a flashlight , and the details of his speech allow us to visualize horrors worse than any we could possibly see . Later , The Bride produces a black mamba snake , and in a sublime touch , reads from a Web page that describes the snake 's deadly powers . <p> Of the original " Kill Bill , " I wrote : " The movie is all storytelling and no story . The motivations have no psychological depth or resonance , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics . " True , but one of the achievements of " Vol. 2 " is that the story is filled in , the characters are developed , and they do begin to resonate , especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill  --  which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet , deadly punch line . <p> Put the two parts together , and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it , loving it , and transcending it . I confess I feared that " Vol. 2 " would be like those sequels that lack the intensity of the original . <p> But this is all one film , and now that we see it whole , it 's greater than its two parts ; Tarantino remains the most brilliantly oddball filmmaker of his generation , and this is one of the best films of the year .
