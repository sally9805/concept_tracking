One <br> Montaa de Oro State Park <br> Central California Coast <br> Eight years ago <br> This was his chance to get it right . he was nervous but confident . This was good . No . . . great . Perfect . A fresh start . A new day . The first time had been a bloody mess . Of course , it counted . It had been everything  --  which was part of the problem . He 'd been careless . He would n't do that again . Because he 'd learned that killing is never as easy as you hope , but it 's sooo worth taking the time and trouble to do it with style . Practice makes perfect . Here he was and here she was . Take two . <br> Looking up at California State Park Ranger Marilu Feathers , he let a smile tickle his lips and said , " Where there 's smoke , there 's fire . " <br> He pulled one corner of his mouth higher than the other , crafting what was intended to be a rakish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corny old saying , and that would show his mastery of the situation . While he was at it , he arched an eyebrow , aiming to look clever , disarming , maybe even handsome . He was rewarded . She smiled . She was flirting with him . <br> In no mood , Feathers smirked . It was Christmas Eve and this clown was about to make her late to dinner at her parents ' house with her brother and his family . Her young niece and nephew would n't care , but her sister-in-law would find it an opportunity to remind single , childless , thirty-something Feathers about the importance of schedules for children . <br> She 'd taken her horse instead of the Jeep to do one last patrol of the nearly deserted sandspit , ringing in the holiday and a well-earned break with a sunset gallop . And now this . <br> The stranger looked Feathers over with a measure of scrutiny and delight , as if examining a long-sought-after rare book found by chance at a yard sale . He had watched in awe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roan mare , from the pass-through between the dunes and had begun galloping across the sand . She scattered spindly-legged sandpipers and inky black cormorants feeding in the surf while brown pelicans and Western gulls circled above , the gulls calling , " Kuk , kuk , kuk . " <br> He had known she 'd take Gypsy from the stable behind the dunes , would go down the Jeep path onto the spit , and would turn right , toward the Rock . He had known exactly where to position himself . She often rode at sunset , when the sandspit was quiet , but not always . He 'd spent disappointing hours , primed , waiting , only to return home unfulfilled . While frustrating , waiting taught him discipline , which he knew he sorely needed . Now , at last , his reward . His heart had thrilled with each beat of the horse 's hooves upon the sand . <br> He felt his emotions running away with him and  --  just as Feathers had reined in her horse  --  he seized command of himself . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it alive and fresh forever . All he had to do was hold on . Hold on . <br> Feathers pulled up her horse beside the makeshift barrier and managed an insincere " Good evening , sir , " and then the admonishment . " You 're in the snowy plover restricted habitat . You ca n't be here , let alone have a campfire . " <br> He knew that . Who could miss the miles of yellow nylon rope on four-foot metal stakes marked with signs , some drawn by schoolchil ? dren , " Share the beach ! " " We love the snowy plover ! " He thought the stupid bird deserved to go extinct , but he knew that if she could Ranger Feathers would sit on their nests  --  mere shallows in the sand , the lazy birds . He 'd not only purposefully gone into the restricted habitat , he 'd built a fire with driftwood . Brilliant . Did he know how to push her buttons , or what ? <br> Standing near him now , she was a sight to behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely on her big-boned , lean frame . He was beguiled by her uniform , her round , flat-brimmed Ranger Stetson hat , her gun , and her badge . Her plain face so easily adopted that no-nonsense bearing . He 'd seen her laugh , but soon after , her face would reassume that stern countenance , that command presence coveted by cops . It came naturally to Feathers . She had been born for the job . <br> He 'd told her , " Where there 's smoke , there 's fire . " Rakish grin . Arched eyebrow . <br> He returned his attention to the marshmallow he was roasting on the end of an opened wire hanger . The next move was hers . He was so excited , he could hardly stand it . Get a grip , buddy ! <br> Feathers thought , What 's he doing ? Trying to flirt with me ? She guessed he was one of the college kids that abounded in Morro Bay and Los Osos , the relaxed beach cities adjacent to the sprawling state park . A state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike in the jagged coastal mountains or to surf and raise hell on the long stretch of secluded sandy beach reached by foot or horseback via twisting , steep trails that traversed the dunes . Only rangers were allowed to drive there . <br> She had invested a lot of time over her years at the park reprimanding , citing , and sometimes arresting the drunken , the loaded , and the pugnacious of all ages . In addition to providing the public information about hiking trails , campsites , local flora and fauna , and the locations of public restrooms , her job was to enforce the law in the park . Those who did not revere this sacred space would feel her iron hand . She was protective of these eight thousand acres . Her corner of paradise . Her mountain of gold . <br> The young adult visitors were usually in packs , or at least pairs . This jackass was alone , sitting on a cheap , webbed-nylon folding chair . He wore a heavy plaid wool jacket , buttoned to the top , blue jeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pulled low over his ears . She saw no other belongings other than the chair , the open bag of marshmallows on the sand near his feet , and the wire hanger . The jacket , though , had deep pockets . <br> The park was nearly empty . Only a few campsites were occupied . The sandspit was deserted except for this guy . He was burning driftwood , an additional insult to the park . Her park . <br> " Sir , you 're going to have to put out that fire and move out of the restricted area . Now . " <br> " I know , Ranger Feathers . " He pulled the golden , softly melting marshmallow from the flames and swung the wire toward Feathers . " Toasted marshmallow ? " <br> The sudden motion startled the horse , and she pranced backward . Gypsy was Feathers 's personal horse and unaccustomed to aggressive movements . <br> " Watch it , pal . " Feathers steadied Gypsy , the horse moving so that Morro Rock was behind them . The giant , crown-shaped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fading winter sun . <br> She was wearing a brass name tag , but his vision had to be extraordinary if he could read it at that distance in the fading light . She leaned forward and gave the horse a couple of firm pats while eyeballing the stranger . <br> The watch cap covered his hair and part of his eyebrows . He was seated , but his legs and arms were long . She guessed that standing he would be at least six feet . His clothes were bulky , but his build looked average . His face was ordinary . Not handsome or ugly . No distinguishing scars or marks . It was a blank canvas , brightened only by the way he looked at her : adoring and consuming . It put her in mind of the way her brother played with her infant niece , slobbering kisses over the baby while taunting , " I 'm gon na eat you up . Eat you up . " <br> " Did n't mean to scare Gypsy . " Tossing off the horse 's name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels turning as she sized him up , wondering , " Do I know this guy ? " It was all this nondescript , young Caucasian male could do to keep from grinning . He knew how the world saw him . He had learned to use it to his advantage . <br> His adoring gaze made her wary . It aroused her instincts of danger . He hoped it also appealed to another part of her . She would be unaccustomed to such attention from men . She was a rawboned woman with a lantern jaw , a squat nose , and thin lips framing a gash of a mouth . Calling her handsome would be generous . She ? was n't the type of woman who inspired sonnets . But he loved her . He could hardly wait to show her how much . He caught his breath , feeling overwhelmed . <br> Control , he told himself . Control . <br> Christmas always made him emotional . <br> She asked , " Do I know you ? " She searched her mind , grabbing at a memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I seen you ? " <br> He pulled the sticky marshmallow from the end of the hanger with his fingers and blew on it before tossing it into his mouth . He chewed with obvious pleasure , letting out a little moan . He stood and stabbed the wire into the sand , where it wobbled back and forth . <br> He struggled to calm his breath . " Nowhere . Everywhere . " <br> " What 's your name ? " <br> He retrieved the wire hanger and intentionally held it by his side in his left hand , farthest from her , in a nonthreatening manner . He ducked beneath the yellow rope and walked a few feet toward the surf . He wrote in the wet , smooth sand . <br> Feathers cocked her head and squinted at the scrawling . " What does that say ? " <br> He shrugged , chucking the wire away . " Does n't matter . " <br> " Okay , pal . . . " Feathers reached behind her and pulled a small spade from a loop on the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and I 'm gon na escort you out of the park . Being Christmas Eve , if you cooperate , I wo n't cite you . If you do n't , I 'll arrest you and you 'll spend the night in jail . Got it ? " <br> " Ranger Feathers , you know about death . " <br> He was standing a few feet away from her and the horse , his hands by his sides . He ? did n't want to breathe through his mouth , but he ? could n't help it . He 'd never been more rock hard . He was afraid that the slightest movement would make him explode , which would be awkward . <br> Control . <br> " Tell me what you know about death , Ranger Feathers . I want to know . I want to know everything . " <br> She shifted the spade to her left hand and pulled out her two-way . <br> The call would go to Ranger Dispatch . Budget cuts had made staffing thin . They would probably reach out to the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not in enough time . <br> " Do you wear the pearl necklace ? " <br> The question caught her off guard . She released the radio button . <br> " Yes , Marilu . That necklace . Do you like it ? " <br> " So you 're the one who gave it to me . " <br> " That 's right . " <br> " Why ? " <br> " You earned it . The heroism you showed the day you brought down Bud Lilly . . . You were judge , jury , and executioner , ridding the world of a worthless creep . That should be honored in a special way . " <br> Finally , she raised Dispatch . <br> He detected relief in her eyes . A crack in the armor . <br> She announced her location into the two-way and asked for an assist with a ? nine- ? eighteen  --  ? a psycho/insane person . <br> Now . <br> In a flash , his hand was in and out of his pocket . He aimed the snub-nose .38 at a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , even though it was the first time he 'd aimed a gun at a human being , other than at his own reflection in the mirror . <br> She reacted quickly , but not quickly enough . He fired . <br> He could n't believe he 'd missed . He looked at his gun as if it had betrayed him . <br> At the sound of the gun blast , the horse had reared . With one hand , Feathers tried to rein in Gypsy while pulling out her gun with the other . Struggling with the frantic horse , she got off a shot . The horse reeled . <br> His hand flew to his neck , which stung like crazy . He drew back bloody fingers . He stared at the blood . She 'd grazed him . He started to giggle . She 'd only grazed him . But the blood . . . And the heat radiating from the long fissure across his skin . It thrilled and calmed him . His hand was steady . It was like magic . He aimed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aim was true . <br> Gypsy took off at full gallop . After fifty yards , mortally wounded Feathers fell from the horse into the surf , scattering the sandpipers and cormorants . The calls from the soaring birds grew more frantic . <br> Overwhelmed , he dropped to his knees . He tried to keep his eyes open , but the pleasure of release was so sublime , he had to close them as he cried out , his hands clutching the sand . <br> Still panting and fuzzy-headed with bliss , he pulled himself together to finish his mission . He picked up his beach chair and bag of marshmallows and walked to retrieve Feathers ' Ranger Stetson from where it had fallen just within reach of the foamy fingers of the surf . The mare Gypsy , hovering near her fallen master , galloped off at his approach . <br> He took a long , final look at his prize , Ranger Marilu Feathers , bleeding into the sand . The young man  --  whom years later Detective Nan Vining would give the nickname T. B. Mann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next phase of his life had begun . <br> A wave washed away his handwriting in the sand . <br> Continues ...
