Sport at its highest level is a pure rush to the edge of human capability . How often do we get to watch mankind at its absolute best ? We hear a composer 's symphony or see the scar from a brilliant surgeon 's operation , but we seldom see these men and women at the moment of supreme achievement . Sport provides one of the rare theaters where these moments can be glimpsed , and the Olympics are its gaudiest stage , where more records are set and broken than at any other athletic event in the world . By watching athletes like Marion Jones , Michael Johnson and Ian Thorpe push out the boundaries of human achievement , do n't we also grow a little bit ? Our very sense of what is possible expands by just a sixteenth of an inch or a hundredth of a second or even by the very staging of the Games . We are not only faster or stronger than we thought , we are also more indomitable of spirit and hopeful of forgiveness , more willing to ignore past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participating . <P> Yet if the Olympics happened every year or always in the same city , they would n't be so much fun . We save up our enthusiasm during the off years , developing a hungry curiosity not just for the Games but also for the place . The first Olympics of the millennium will be held in Sydney , Australia , a Pacific Rim capital city . Its spectacular harbor and opera house are among the world 's most dramatic settings , superbly fit for what will unfold next week . The harbor is also the site of a signature Australian event , the triathlon , a lung-burning triad of swimming , cycling and running that will be making its Olympic debut . That Australia 's famous sharks may be counted as spectators simply highlights the fact that this is a country and a continent still brimming with frontier spirit . They like a challenge here . <P> Australia is a land peopled first by Aborigines , forcibly resettled by Europeans , and then remade by immigrants from all over the world . A new wave of immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend on it to participate in 300 events , which will be covered by an astounding 21,000 journalists . You can tell yourself you wo n't watch , but you will . Call it the Olympic spirit , call it the love of good television , call it being a sucker for a good race , game , match or fight . Ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls  --  and the children we all become as we get lost in the spectacle  --  turn your attention to Sydney , where for 17 days this fall we will see one hell of a race . The human race . <P> Sure , it 's easy to forget what is glorious about the Games , especially in non-O years . There are times when the five linked rings  --  supposed to represent the harmonious union of continents  --  seem to symbolize instead the tawdry connections between sport and so many of society 's baser attributes . We read all the time about the scandals . Doping . Tainted records . Bribery . Boycotts . And in Olympics immemorial , racism and sexism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big deal of the Olympics .
