Next time you have to wait six weeks for the kitchen door or lawn furniture you ordered , think of Gene Kirila . He would have you order your custom whatever at a store register , then direct you to drive around back , where  --  Presto ! Out it would pop from a portable minifactory . <P> Kirila has devised a system that will make almost any product , anywhere , anytime . Well , at least anything that can be molded  --  which is just about everything we touch these days . Kirila 's Virtual Engineered Composites ( VEC ) process is a factory in a box . The box can be as small as a mop basin or as big ( so far ) as a 40-ft. freight container . Plopped down in the middle of Azerbaijan or Arizona or Angola , it could start pushing out toilet seats one day and pipeline sections the next . <P> VEC 's big secret : a digitally controlled chemical molding system that can be operated on site or , via the Internet , from thousands of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a 3-D fax machine . " <P> The VEC process is to manufacturing what DOS was to the personal-computer business in its early days . If it proves itself , it will lead the way toward an entirely new system of manufacture in which we can make things digitally . " If operating systems could run computers , they should be able to run a factory , " Kirila says . " My big question was this : How do you leverage everything that is happening in the information age and use it to build tangible products ? " <P> Another big question : How does the box work ? <P> Say you want to introduce the Jacuzzi to newly affluent Chinese peasants . Instead of shipping the tubs from California , you simply ship the VEC unit , or cell . To make the tubs , two composite skins are draped over a foam model , and a thermochemical reaction causes them to harden into shape . ( Because no metal bending is involved and the " thermoset " process uses chemistry , not immense heat , the molds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins are then attached to a universal frame . The cell is closed and filled with pressurized water , which braces the skins together . Then composite materials are injected into the mold and catalyzed , causing the materials to harden . Unlike injection molding , a common manufacturing process , VEC 's " floating mold " uses an operating system that constantly adjusts the water pressure and chemical balance . It sounds simple . But when you consider that there are up to 800 variables in the process  --  and thus 800 things that can go wrong  --  the complexity is astounding . <P> Since the entire unit is virtually self-contained , it can be assembled and running anywhere in a matter of days . If the market in baths dries up , you can switch the mold skins to make another product within an hour . Labor ? O.K. , you have to add hardware or electrical wiring to the finished product . But the VEC cell requires three people and very little technical expertise  --  as long as there is a link to the mother node .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
