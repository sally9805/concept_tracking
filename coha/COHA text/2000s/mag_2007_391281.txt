Headnote Geeks , guns and glory : The mad scramble to finish Halo 3 , the most anticipated video game of all time ONE MORNING IN AUGUST , WHEN AN UNFAMILIAR CAR pulls into the parking lot of the video-game developer Bungie Studios , it is quickly greeted by no fewer than three uniformed guards . Bungie is best known for creating Halo , a " first-person shooter " set in the year 2552 that has become one of the most popular video games of all time . It 's only a month before the September 25th release of Halo 3 , which has been three years in the making , and security is tight at Bungie 's headquarters just outside of Seattle . Inside the anonymous , hangarlike building , only seven of Bungie 's 120 employees have access to the all-important server room , which stores the game 's top-secret code - on 50,000 gigabytes of hard-drive space . The room can only be unlocked with a biometric hand scanner . " The precautions are as high as if we were printing money , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final version of the game like plates at the mint . " With Bungie competitor Rockstar announcing the delay of the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto IV until 2008 , Halo 3 stands alone as the highest-profile game this holiday season . There are already 1.2 million pre-orders , and Microsoft is predicting the game will do " Harry Potter numbers . " " It 's our intent to be the biggest entertainment launch of this calendar year , " says Jeff Bell , vice president of global marketing in Microsoft 's gaming division . Bell includes all forms of entertainment in this calculation , including Spiderman 3 , which holds the record for the highest-grossing opening weekend of any film , having peaked at just over $150 million . Now , with only six days to go before the finished game ships to manufacturing plants , there 's a final-stretch sense of frenzy at Bungie HQ , tempered only by a slightly dazed fatigue . Harold Ryan , Bungie 's stocky thirty-six-year-old studio manager , paces the floor with a large iced Starbucks coffee . He 'd been at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catnapped , showered and returned . It 's now just after ten . Jaime Griesemer , a sallow , red-haired gameplay designer , wanders by and notes , glumly , " They locked me out of my computer last week . " As the deadline approaches , Ryan is often forced to lock employees out of the system , lest they continue to tweak the game ; its code is so sensitive that a minor change could have massive , unknown repercussions . At the moment , the main buzz of activity centers around the teams of bug testers , who are still furiously playing ( and replaying ) the game , searching for the tiniest glitches . This geek dream job is not as fun as it might sound . " You 're not just playing Halo all day , " says Jarrard . " You 're playing this piece of this mission . For nine hours . " The Bungie headquarters was designed by one of the studio 's virtual " map " architects . ( They create the jungles , deserts and space stations where Halo 's action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the employees spread out across a windowless , vaguely futuristic space . The mood lighting is designed to cut monitor glare , but it creates a bunkerlike atmosphere , reminiscent of Jack Bauer 's headquarters on 24 . The work force is almost entirely male , with a high proportion sporting glasses , facial hair and Bungie swag ; it looks like a casting call for the next Judd Apatow movie . Halo 's lulling New Age soundtrack emanates from the computers of numerous other cubes , punctuated by the occasional burst of artillery fire . One cubicle 's entire wall is papered with Bill Gates ' face , grinning from a dozen covers of a magazine called Diversity , arranged like a Warhol series of Mao paintings . Bungie was acquired by Microsoft in 2000 - for between $20 million and $40 million , according to the Wall Street Journal . The studio used to be based at the Microsoft campus , but after the completion of Halo 2 , in 2004 , the company moved to its current space . " The people at Microsoft ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily . HALO 'S STORY LINE PITS humanity against an invading horde of alien religious zealots known as the Covenant . The original Halo , released two months after the September nth attacks , sold 5 million copies and became the marquee game of Microsoft 's brand-new Xbox console . Halo 2 , released in 2004 , was even bigger , thanks to a new multiplayer mode that allowed friends - and strangers - to do battle over the Internet . The game sold 8 million copies , earning $125 million its first day alone . The newest version , Microsoft hopes , will be the killer app that inspires millions of rabid Halo fans to upgrade their hardware to the Xbox 360 ( Halo 3 wo n't play on the original Xbox ) . Making a video game , Bungie staffers say , is a lot like making a blockbuster movie , only harder . Head writer Frank O'Connor , a shaved-headed , thirty-six-year-old Scotsman , personally wrote 60,000 lines of combat dialogue . Engineer Hao Chen , who is thirty-three years old and grew up in China , spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure that any water appearing in the game hyper-realistically eddies , flows and creates turbulence around objects . There are graphic artists who focus specifically on designing weapons , others who specialize in armor or vehicles . Head programmer Chris Butcher ( 29 , of Kakanui , New Zealand ) develops complicated artificial-intelligence code to ensure that the marauding enemies attacking players do so in ever-increasingly devious ways . Meanwhile , in one of the testing rooms , eleven guys sit in front of twenty-one computer monitors . Dramatic scenes flash across the flat screens in rapid succession : jeeps flying straight at a gigantic insectlike robot , alien blood spattering on a snowy landscape , spaceships hovering in a purple sky , rifle scopes zooming in and out with furious , phallic intensity . But the testers are nearly immobile , gaming fingers excepted . The players wear headsets , so the room is silent , save for the occasional offhand tester comment . " Did you see Sam Raimi is remaking Clash of the Titans ? " " If I were Kenny Rogers , I 'd have plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " BUNGIE WAS FOUNDED in 1991 by Alex Seropian , then a math major at the University of Chicago . Inspired by the first Gulf War , he created Operation : Desert Storm , a game for Macs that sold 2,500 copies . ( The final battle involved a giant Saddam Hussein head . ) Around this time , Seropian met a fellow student named Jason Jones in an artificial-intelligence class . They became partners , and began writing more Mac games from Seropian 's apartment . Bungie 's first big hit , Marathon , came in 1994 . The game , a first-person shooter set on an abandoned spaceship , was modeled after the wildly popular game Doom , which was only available for the PC . Halo , too , was originally developed as a Mac game . But after catching a demo at a MacWorld convention in 1999 , Microsoft bought Bungie and the studio reworked the game for the then-new Xbox , which needed a flagship title to help it compete with Sony 's popular PlayStation . Halo 's plot is fairly typical sci-fi : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to colonize distant planets , which has resulted in conflict with the evil , garishly armored Covenant . Players control a faceless , armored cyborg called Master Chief- a cryogenically frozen supersoldier , genetically engineered for battle , and the last hope for humanity - who bears more than a passing resemblance to the beloved Star Wars villain Boba Fett . As the game 's story line progresses , players move through various levels of a ring-shaped space station called Halo , all of which is really just an excuse to showcase cool weapons ( the S2 AM Sniper Rifle , the M19 SSM Rocket Launcher ) and commandeerable jeeps , tanks and flying machines ( Scorpions , Banshees and Warthogs ) , and to slaughter as many alien bad guys as possible . But there are also clever surprises . Halfway through the original Halo , an entirely unfamiliar alien enemy called the Flood makes a shocking appearance , forcing players to suddenly face a radically different foe and alter their combat strategy . ( It 's as if , several levels into a game of Pac-Man , the dots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gameplay made Halo stand out from other games . " For the original Halo , we came up with this concept of " thirty seconds of fun , " " recalls Griesemer . " We decided if we could make something fun for thirty seconds , we could just do that over and over , and it would be fun indefinitely . So you see enemies from a distance , shoot at them , have a little bit of a fight , it breaks up , they scatter . And then you keep moving and it starts over again . " THE CREATION OF HALO 3 began with eight months of preproduction , with a core story team fleshing out the game 's plot . During this period , everyone at Bungie can weigh in . A graphic artist might suggest incorporating a cool-looking weapon he 's created , or making a bad guy 's armor green instead of yellow . ( Copies of Guns and Ammo and a magazine called Vietnam are piled in one cubicle . ) Animators and programmers - who attend to details like making sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also push various action set pieces . " With Halo , you 're always asking , What 's the big gameplay ? " says head writer Joseph Staten . " " Well , on this level , you 're going to go to a gas-mining facility and it 's going to start plummeting and you 'll have a fight on this thing as it 's falling through the air . ' So then we come up with a story to make that happen . " Eventually , a detailed outline of each level of the game ends up on a dry-erase board as gameplay designers , led by Griesemer , concern themselves with the specifics of what a player will encounter on each level : weapons , vehicles , terrain , the ease or difficulty of the mission . Griesemer was a philosophy major in college . " It 's funny how many ex-philosophy majors you find in game design , " he says . " You have to learn to observe yourself in philosophy . Like , " Oh , this is a bias . I need to analyze my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gaming . You have to be able to play , but also step outside yourself and say , " Oh , that would have been more fun if that guy had n't killed me . ' " There are other Bungie products in the works , including a super-secret non-Halo game still in the prototype phase and a new Halo interactive series created by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson , a fan . " He does n't even want to call it a game , " Jarrard says . And Halo 2 remains one of the most popular games in Major League Gaming ( the best player , Tom " Tsquared " Taylor , takes in $250,000 a year in sponsorships ) . " We want to make it a televised sport , " says O'Connor , quickly adding , " Let 's be honest , it 's a game , not a sport , like snooker or poker . But like those games , it takes skill . You could cut to commentators , show replays in slow motion . I doubt it 'll be on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have explosions , or trucks flipping over , or tanks blowing spaceships out of the sky . " Despite years of focus groups and testing sessions , auditing every conceivable aspect of gameplay , the Bungie team admits that what makes a game work can be impossible to predict . " There 's this magic thing that happens a month before we ship , " says Griesemer . " It 's terrifying when your boss is like " - he pounds his fist - " " When is the game going to be fun ? ! ' The designer can always see that it is going to be fun . But fun is the last thing to come in . It 's like , " You have to take my word for it . ' " LATER THAT EVENING , IN downtown Seattle , 800 or so guys ( and a negligible minority of women ) form a line at the site of the 1962 World 's Fair . The fair 's most famous artifact , the Space Needle , designed in the Tomorrowland fashion of the era to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . But the draw , tonight , is the former " Spacearium , " now an IMAX theater , where the group will be treated to a sneak peek at Halo 3 . Leaks about the new game have been as closely guarded as the ending of the final Harry Potter novel , so for hard-core fans , tonight 's preview is a very big deal . O'Connor also handles outreach online , and is widely known within the fan community as " Frankie . " He announced the IMAX preview just one day earlier on Bungie 's Web site . Fans had started to line up outside the theater by ten the following morning , for an event that would not begin for another twelve hours . When the doors finally open , a river of dudes courses into the complex . T-shirts - BEEN THERE , WRECKED THAT , the Statue of Liberty holding a pistol instead of a torch - are pretty much the fashion standard ; one fan totes a torn-open , half-empty twelve-pack of Halo 3 Mountain Dew like a briefcase . As they file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , along with a sense of excitement that would precede a rock concert ( or , for this crowd , a group appearance by the cast of Heroes ) . O'Connor soon emerges with a microphone and begins to play a heretofore unseen level of Halo 3 , in which Master Chief maneuvers through a series of tunnels to emerge into a beautifully rendered meadow . The crowd roars when Master Chief races around the landscape in a jeep , when his jeep flips over and crashes in spectacular fashion , when he incinerates another player with a flamethrower . ( To be fair , it 's a pretty easy crowd : They also whoop when O'Connor goes to the game 's menu page and changes one of the playing options . ) Later , O'Connor asks , " Anyone want to see a Spartan laser kill a Warthog at point-blank ? " The answer is unanimous , and extremely loud . Sidebar MASTER BLASTER Halo 3 's main character , Master Chief . Wielding rocket launchers , flame-throwers and other enormous guns , he wages battle against an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around 120 people work at Bungie , including programmers , gameplay designers , writers , musicians and at least one guy whose job it is to make water in Halo 3 look super-realistic .
