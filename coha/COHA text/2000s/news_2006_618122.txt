<p> God does n't always speak from a burning bush , or from atop a mountain . When he spoke to Mary Kay and Charlie Jackson , they were walking the dog . <p> What he told the Jacksons has prompted them to take their kids from school , empty their Doraville home and prepare for a life where people thirst , physically and spiritually . <p> The Jacksons are newly minted Methodist missionaries who are about to move to Ghana , where they will put their engineering degrees to work as never before . They leave Aug. 2 , their 20th wedding anniversary . <p> Mary Kay Jackson , a civil engineer , will help drill wells , bringing water to villages desperate for drinking water and sanitary treatment facilities in the west African nation . Her husband , a mechanical engineer , will teach mathematics at a university in Accra , Ghana 's capital . <p> Their expertise  --  they have five university degrees between them  --  will net husband and wife about $30,000 per year . That 's an eighth of the salary they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 , and Ken , 12 , will sacrifice the security of friends and classes in the DeKalb public schools system to attend classes in Accra . <p> The dog ? His name is Ziker , and he 's already there , staying with family friends . " He 's barking at cows and chasing lizards , " said Mary Kay . <p> The Jacksons will leave Atlanta on a jet bound to London . From there , they 'll board another plane that will take them to Accra , a city of 2 million . They plan to remain there for five years , maybe longer . <p> " No , we 're not scared , " said Mary Kay , 45 . <p> " We 're nervous , " offered 49-year-old Charlie , " once in a while . " <p> " This is what God wants us to do with our lives right now , " she said . <p> Leaving Atlanta <p> Their house , an improbable pink , faux Victorian , is wedged in a leafy little cul-de-sac not far off Peachtree Industrial Boulevard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more money than they are now . <p> It 's a nice home , four bedrooms and 3 1/2 baths , and it 's in disarray . The dining room table has been packed away ; chairs are shoved against each other as if people sitting in them suddenly jumped up and ran off . Oak cabinets in the kitchen bear yellow Post-It notes with varied instructions : Pack to store . Toss . Ghana . <p> They met when they were graduate students at Stanford University . She was from Houston . Westfield , N.J. , was his home . When they married in 1986 , " we decided to split the difference between home places and live in Atlanta , " he said . <p> The years were good . He got a job with Bell Laboratories . She put her education to work at an engineering company that designed and built several water systems , including the F. Wayne Hill Water Reclamation Center in Gwinnett . Chip , who looks like his dad , was born in 1991 . Three years later , along came kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay . <p> Devout Methodists , the Jacksons for years attended Peachtree Road United Methodist Church , where they met Michael and Claire Mozely of Marietta . The Jacksons moved their membership to Dunwoody UMC , closer to their home , but stayed in touch with their friends from Marietta . <p> One night in 1999 , at the Jacksons ' dinner table , the Mozelys said they were heading to Ghana as missionaries . Ghana ? The Jacksons had to look in an atlas to find it . <p> In 2002 , they saw it for themselves when the family visited the Mozelys . A nation about the same size as Oregon , Ghana is a flat land , with more than 20 million inhabitants . They stayed two weeks . <p> The Jacksons returned home struck by what they had seen  --  the beauty of the country , the desperation of its people . <p> One memory was especially vivid . They recalled a visit to a village not far from Accra , where the Jacksons came across children dipping water from a river . It was muddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family sometimes drank the untreated water when they were thirsty . <p> " You saw the needs all around  --  the illness and poverty , " she said . <p> Her children were as moved as she . " They asked me , ' What can we do for them ? ' " she recalled . Mary Kay began asking herself the same question . <p> Charlie , meanwhile , got laid off . Bell Laboratories , his employer , had gone through a series of mergers and name changes , and he was a casualty of the corporate upheaval . In 2003 , he got a job with United Parcel Service and was n't ready to cash in their lives in metro Atlanta . <p> And yet , he felt something , too . <p> " After the kids got turned on to this mission work , I recognized I needed to get with the program , " he said . <p> One summer evening in 2004 , while walking the dog , husband and wife came to a joint decision : They would go . <p> God had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trim lawns . <p> ' Lovely interpretation ' <p> The Mission Society is the Jacksons ' sponsor . Based in Norcross , the society has trained more than 300 missionaries for service all over the world and currently oversees more than 180 . <p> The missionaries ' abilities vary , said Ruth Burgner , the society 's director of communications . Some are teachers , others ministers . Others , such as the Jacksons , bring specialized technical skills to their tasks . <p> But they share at least one trait , she said . Each believes in a " holistic ministry "  --  tending to physical , mental and spiritual needs . <p> " We need to present the gospel in very many different ways , " said Burgner . " And sometimes the only way we can present that is by ministering to their physical needs first . " <p> The Jacksons , she said , " are a lovely , lovely interpretation of that . " <p> The Jacksons have been preparing for their departure for more than two months . They 've attended cultural sensitivity training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colorado . They 've been practicing Twi , the predominant regional dialect . <p> Speaking at area churches and Sunday School classes , they 've raised about $500,000 , which they estimate will underwrite their costs for five years . <p> About half that sum came from their church , Dunwoody UMC , said Wiley Stephens , the church 's senior pastor . The church , whose membership tops 4,000 , is planning to send a team to visit the Jacksons for a couple of weeks next year to offer them whatever help they may need , Stephens said . <p> Back home , a committee will oversee some of the nuts and bolts of the life the family left behind . A real estate agent , for example , has agreed to make sure their house stays rented , and an accountant has promised to keep an eye on their finances , Stephens said . <p> Another group decorated two teddy bears for Chip and Ken . One bears the colors of the Ghanaian flag : red , yellow and green ; the other is red , white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to know we 're always thinking about them , " Stephens said . <p> The Jacksons , meanwhile , are thinking about the days they have left . Their sons are at a Christian camp in Texas , but will rejoin mom and dad in a couple of weeks . After that , it 's a long plane ride , and a new life , for at least the next five years . <p> Five years . When 2011 comes around , Chip will be 20 . Ken , their baby , will be 17 . <p> And then ? The Jacksons do n't know but are hardly worried . They expect God will tell them what to do , just as he did on an evening walk with a dog .
