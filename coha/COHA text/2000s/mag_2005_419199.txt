The Yepun reflector in the foreground has imaged the substellar companions to 2M 1207 , AB Pictoris , and GQ Lupi . It is one of four 8.2-meter reflectors making up the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope in Chile , one of the world 's premier astronomical facilities . Courtesy ESO. // SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS is rarely a straight and smooth path . The history of astronomy offers only a few examples , such as the discovery of the cosmic microwave background and pulsars , where one can point to a specific " eureka " episode when the scientific community quickly accepted a new phenomenon . More often , the picture remains muddled as pieces of it slowly fall into place over many years . The latter scenario certainly applies to the recent spate of images of supposed planets outside our solar system . In the past year two teams have presented images of possible exoplanets , one of which could go down in history as a milestone event - the moment when large telescopes combined with adaptive optics to give humanity its first picture of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which detects planets by their gravitational influence on their host star , direct images raise prospects of follow-up studies to characterize planetary compositions , temperatures , and even meteorology . But each image presented so far is plagued by an element of uncertainty or controversy . Only with the benefit of hindsight will a consensus be reached as to who won the race to image the first extrasolar planet . Several possible exoplanets have been imaged , but none are like anything in our solar system . * EUREKA ATTAINED ? Just as the first discoveries of exoplanets in the 1990s were preceded by several false alarms , previous exoplanet image claims fell by the wayside when subjected to intense observational scrutiny . In 1998 , for example , NASA publicized a Hubble Space Telescope image of the " runaway planet " TMR-1C in Taurus . According to NASA , the object had been gravitationally flung out of its star system . Most astronomers were highly skeptical , however , and their wariness was justified when the object turned out to be a distant background star ( S &T:; April 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yepun acquired this near-infrared image of the brown dwarf 2M 1207 and a faint , redder companion just 0.78 arcsecond away . The companion , 2M 1207b , is gravitationally bound to the brown dwarf . But should a 5-Jupiter-mass object at a distance of at least 55 astronomical units ( a.u. ) from a brown dwarf be considered a planet ? Photograph This false-color image from the Digitized Sky Survey is nearly centered on the star Sigma Orionis , which gives its name to the surrounding cluster of young stars . The inset from the 4.2-meter William Herschel Telescope , in near-infrared light , shows the extremely faint cluster member Sigma Orionis 70 ( orange circle ) . Comparison with evolutionary models suggests that this free-floating object has a mass of only 2 to 8 Jupiters. // In the late 1990s , several teams presented images and spectra of cool , isolated planetary-mass objects in nearby star-forming regions . These " free-floaters " or " planemos " remain controversial , because some astronomers argue that they are low-mass brown dwarfs . Unlike the TMR-1C fiasco , however , evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low as 3 Jupiters , which places them firmly in the planetary-mass regime . Astronomers still do n't know whether these objects formed from collapsing gas clouds ( like stars do ) or whether they represent embryos ejected from newly forming planetary systems . Either way , they are not gravitationally bound to stars , which means they are not " planets " in a conventional sense . But in the past few years , astronomy has witnessed the convergence of large telescopes , adaptive optics for countering atmospheric turbulence , and a winning strategy for exoplanet imaging ( S &T:; April 2004 , page 44 ) . Astronomers are targeting several hundred young , nearby stars ( within 400 light-years ) to catch newborn giant planets while they are still glowing in infrared light . The objects start off hot from the gravitational energy of their formation , but over millions of years they radiate their heat into space , cooling and fading to invisibility like cosmic Cheshire Cats . One of several recently released images will probably turn out to be the winner of the exoplanet-image sweepstakes . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Southern Observatory ) has targeted young stars using Yepun , one of the four 8.2-meter reflectors comprising ESO 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile . On April 27 , 2004 , the team imaged the dim brown dwarf 2MASSW J1207334-393254 , or 2M 1207 for short . This brown dwarf belongs to the TW Hydrae Association , whose members have estimated ages of about 8 million years . The image , which was released last September loth , revealed an extremely faint , red blip just 0.78 arcsecond from 2M 1207 ( S &T:; December 2004 , page 14 ) . The brown dwarf is more than 100 times brighter than its companion , named 2M 1207b . Photograph Above : French astronomer Gal Chauvin led the international team that imaged substellar companions to 2M 1207 and AB Pictoris . Right : Exoplanet images would n't be possible without adaptive optics , which employ fast-acting sensors and deformable mirrors to cancel out the distortions of atmospheric turbulence . The Very Large Telescope 's NACO adaptive-optics instrument , shown here , played a pivotal role in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a very strong exoplanet candidate , " says Ben M. Zuckerman ( University of California , Los Angeles ) , a member of Chauvin 's team . But could this companion be a background star , like the infamous TMR-1C ? The probability of such a chance alignment of two cool objects was about one in a million . A VLT spectrum of 2M 1207b revealed an atmosphere laden with water vapor , indicating a cool , substellar temperature . But what is 2M 1207b 's mass ? If both objects lie at the estimated 230-light-year distance , the 0.78-arcsecond separation on the sky yields a physical separation of at least 55 astronomical units ( a.u. ) , nearly twice the Neptune-Sun distance . That 's much too far to allow a direct mass measurement from the radial-velocity method . Instead , the group relied on evolutionary models that calculate how substellar objects should cool and fade over time . More massive objects retain their heat longer . By plugging 2M 1207b 's age and luminosity into models developed by Isabelle Baraffe and Gilles Chabrier ( University of Lyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object contains 52 Jupiters worth of mass and has a temperature of about 1,250 Kelvin . The same method yields a mass of 25 Jupiters for the brown-dwarf host . But this estimate is valid only if 2M 1207b lies at the same distance as the brown dwarf . In January 2005 Glenn H. Schneider ( University of Arizona ) presented Hubble observations taken on August 28 , 2004 , that essentially confirmed that the two have common motion across the sky ( proper motion ) , a very strong indication that they are gravitationally bound ( April issue , page 22 ) . In April 2005 , Chauvin 's team posted VLT observations from earlier this year that clinched its case for common proper motion . The new results leave only a one-in-a-billion chance that 2M 1207b is a background star . " Our new images show convincingly that this really is a planet , the first planet ever imaged outside our solar system , " says Chauvin . In a paper to appear in Astronomy &; Astrophysics , Chauvin 's team also cited a clever technique pioneered a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ray Jayawardhana ( University of Toronto ) , and Gibor Basri ( University of California , Berkeley ) . They found that many very cool free-floaters in the Upper Scorpius Association exhibit narrow spectral lines , which indicates atmospheric pressure that one would expect in a planetary-mass object 's relatively low-gravity environment ( S &T:; October 2004 , page 20 ) . Their results indicate that evolutionary models actually overestimate the mass of very cool free-floaters . Since the TW Hydrae and Scorpius associations are about the same age , this study implies that 2M I207b 's mass could be even lower than the 5 Jupiters derived from models . Based on this impressive evidence , most astronomers agree that Chauvin 's team has probably imaged a planetarymass object orbiting a brown dwarf . * Not So Fast But many astronomers are reluctant to call 2M 1207b a " planet . " Their hesitation stems not just from the fact that the companion orbits a brown dwarf rather than a star , but that it does so at a very large distance . To many astronomers , this system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively low 5:1 mass ratio and the 55-a.u. separation are typical of binary stars . The 2M 1207 system probably formed from a collapsing cloud of gas that fragmented into two components , which went on to produce 25- and 5-Jupiter-mass objects . When astronomers think of planets , they envision objects that form via the accretion of gas and planetesimals inside a circumstellar disk . Brown dwarfs have very small , low-mass disks , so it 's difficult to conceive how a disk around 2M 1207 could ever form a 5-Jupiter-mass object at 55 a.u . " Given the rather unusual properties of the 2M 1207 system , the giant planet most probably did not form like the planets in our solar system , " Chauvin concedes . " Instead , it must have formed the same way our Sun formed , by a one-step gravitational collapse of a cloud . " The only plausible disk scenarios assume that 2M 1207b formed much closer in . A third body could have gravitationally ejected it to a much greater distance or wrenched it into a highly eccentric orbit whose far point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these scenarios seem rather ad hoc , they are . For astronomers who think planets and brown dwarfs should be distinguished based on how they formed , 2M 12O7b is not a planet . " I find the " sub-brown dwarf " label very appealing , " says Geoffrey W Marcy ( University of California , Berkeley ) , coleader of the team that has discovered most of the 160 known exoplanets . " Its mass is large relative to that of the primary , and its orbital distance makes the simple term " planet " inadequate and simplistic . The term " sub-brown dwarf " suggests its high mass relative to planets and some new formation process at work . " But many astronomers disagree with this reasoning . After all , nobody knows for certain how 2M 1207b formed . In 2003 the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) stated its preference for differentiating " planets " and " brown dwarfs " strictly on mass , leaving formation out of the question . In such a mass-based definition , the dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs is clear-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will experience a brief period of deuterium ( hydrogen-2 ) fusion in their cores . Less-massive bodies lack the oomph to compress their cores to high enough temperatures and pressures to ignite any fusion . Photograph On August 28 , 2004 , the Hubble Space Telescope 's NICMOS nearinfrared camera imaged 2M 1207b ( pink dot ) . The brown-dwarf host , whose position is circled , has been mostly subtracted by image processing . The Hubble observations helped confirm that the brown dwarf and its cool companion are traveling together and thus lie at the same distance . // The IAU position avoids the ambiguities of formation . " Masses are an observable quantity , whereas how something formed a long time ago is unknowable , " says Zuckerman . " What 's of interest to astronomers are the properties of planetary-mass objects : chemistry , composition , temperature , luminosity . So it does n't matter how they formed . " Gibor Basri , who has written extensively on nomenclature issues , agrees . " The 2M 1207 planet defies expectations because it 's too far away and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating to see how the discussion would change if the mass was 0.5 Jupiter instead of 5 Jupiters . At what mass does a sub-brown dwarf get to be called a planet ? I still favor a simple definition for a planet that is not driven by expectations from our solar system . " So unless the evolutionary models are completely out of whack , or if 2M 120 ? b is much older than the estimated 8-million-year age , it 's a " planet " according to the lAU 's mass-based definition . If this logic prevails , Chauvin 's image will deservedly go down in the history books . * Separating Tomatoes from Oranges Regardless of nomenclature , 2M 1207b raises profound issues about the formation of stars and planets . In 1998 the exoplanet-hunting team led by Geoff Marcy and R. Paul Butler ( Carnegie Institution of Washington ) discovered two massive companions orbiting the star HD 168443 . The objects contain at least 7.7 and 17.2 Jupiter masses and orbit the star at 0.3 and 2.9 a.u. , respectively . They must orbit HD 168443 in nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two coplanar , substellar objects orbiting within 3 a.u. of a star strongly suggest formation within a disk , which spells " planets . " Yet both , particularly the outer one , are considerably more massive than 2M 1207b. // An infrared spectrum of 2M 1207b taken at the Very Large Telescope reveals deep absorption lines due to water vapor in the object 's atmosphere . This indicates the cool temperature of a young planet . // Observations by the VLT and Hubble prove that 2M 1207 and its companion have common proper motion , which means they are gravitationally bound . The orange and red crosses mark the observed position of the companion relative to 2M 1207 . Clearly , the two objects remain fixed with respect to each other . If 2M 1207b had been a background object , its relative position would have changed as shown by the gray line . Yepun 's infrared image of the protostar GQ Lupi shows a faint companion 0.73 " away , which translates to a physical separation of about 100 a.u . The system formed only 1 million years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uncertainties in how this process occurs , evolutionary models predict a wide range of possible masses for the companion . // The contrast between the 2M 1207 and HD 168443 systems offers compelling evidence that the star- and planetformation processes can produce objects that overlap in mass . For those who base definitions on formation , a planet can be more massive than a brown dwarf . This is hardly a surprise . After all , why should the planet-formation process cut off exactly at the mass where star formation begins ? " Even though a tomato may have the same mass as an orange , one formed on a citrus tree and the other on a vine . Our job is to separate the tomatoes from the oranges , " says Alan P. Boss ( Carnegie Institution of Washington ) . The low mass of 2M 1207b also bolsters the case that the lowest-mass free-floaters are indeed of planetary mass , which begs the intriguing question of how low in mass the star-formation process can go . Photograph Yepun has imaged a faint companion to the young star AB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronagraph . Although the companion 's mass remains uncertain , it could be on the borderline between planets and brown dwarfs . It is at least 260 a.u. from the star , 6Vi times farther than Pluto 's average distance from the Sun . // * Candidates Galore Two other contenders for First Exoplanet Image have also staked their claims . In late April Chauvin 's group released an image of a substellar companion to the 30-million-year-old K2 star AB Pictoris . These two objects , whose common proper motion has been established , are separated by a whopping 260 a.u. at minimum . According to evolutionary models , the 1,700K companion appears to be right on the cusp between planets and brown dwarfs , at about 13 or 14 Jupiter masses . " If AB Pictoris b is eventually shown to have a mass less than 13 Jupiters , it should take precedence over 2M 1207b as the first imaged exoplanet , since we discovered AB Pic b in March 2003 , " says Zuckerman . In early April , a team led by Ralph Neuhauser ( University of Jena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yepun . This object orbits GQ Lupi - a protostar , not a brown dwarf - at roughly 100 a.u . ( July issue , page 18 ) . It had been imaged in 1999 by Bubble and in 2002 by the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope , which gave Neuhauser and his colleagues the time baseline they needed to confirm shared proper motion . GQ Lupi b 's spectrum indicates a very cool body of about 2,000K . The problem is the system 's extremely youthful 1-million-year age , which stresses evolutionary models to the max . Based on what model one chooses to adopt , GQ Lupi b could be anywhere from 1 to 42 Jupiter masses , though Neuhauser points out that uncertainties in models or temperature estimates could easily push 2M 1207b into the brown dwarf-mass range . If future research demonstrates that this object is near the low end of the possible mass range , astronomers may eventually consider GQ Lupi b to be the first imaged exoplanet . Neuhauser points out the thorny issues relating to nomenclature and priority . " What if a 12-Jupiter-mass object circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planet ? " he asks . " The important thing to me is that around 2004/2005 , several very good candidates have been presented quasi-simultaneously , and it 's probably only a matter of a few years until there will be a consensus for which objects are planets and which are not . But remember , the GQ Lupi companion was first imaged in 1999 . " The floodgates have been opened . With a half dozen teams in the competition , and with more planet image candidates awaiting confirmation of shared proper motion , expect more controversy in the coming months . As more objects are imaged , and as radial-velocity surveys find more planets , the picture will eventually clarify itself , and the winner of the exoplanet-imaging sweepstakes will be declared . In the meantime , the flood of new discoveries and follow-up observations will teach astronomers a great deal about the diversity of substellar objects and the formation and commonality of planets .
