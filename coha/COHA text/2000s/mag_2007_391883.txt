Headnote Portraitist Emmet Gowin 's most enduring subject is his wife HE WAS N'T LIKE the other Danville boys , Edith recalls . He looked sharp that night in 1961 , clad entirely in black for the dance at the Y ; later , she learned that he listened to jazz and classical music . Emmet Gowin wanted to be an artist but was having trouble finding a subject . In Edith Morris , he did . They married three years later , and Gowin went on to make his first photographs of Edith and her extended family It was a welcoming family , and a large one , clustered in five houses on a Danville , Virginia , cul-desac . By 1971 , when this picture was taken , Edith and Emmet had the first of their two sons , Elijah ( playing with a train set ) , and five nephews and nieces ( one of whom appears in a blur near the train tracks ) . Each year , gifts for nearly 20 people would be piled at the foot of a Christmas tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . By mid-morning , the living room floor would be a wasteland of torn wrapping paper . " It would pretty much look like that every Christmas , " Edith remembers . Neither Edith nor Emmet can recall the precise circumstances that led to this photograph , but they know the process well . " She 'll look at me and see the way I 'm looking at her , and she 'll know , " he says . " I do n't even say anything , I just get up and go get the camera . " " What he 'll do is just stare a little bit , " she says , " and I know to keep the feeling I have there , whether it 's a solemnness or whether it 's a glee in my eye-whatever it is , to not get into another mood . " Other photographers have taken their spouses as subjects . Gowin 's mentor at the Rhode Island School of Design , Harry Callahan , made abstract pictures of his wife , Eleanor ; Alfred Stieglitz said the countless pictures he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gowin 's pictures-with Edith 's characteristically defiant , tomboyish air , often tempered by an ethereal light-are anything but derivative . The couple 's collaboration launched a distinguished career : Gowin 's family photographs earned him fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts , and his work has been published in three monographs and featured in numerous museum collections . For the past 34 years , he has taught at Princeton University . For many years Gowin was content to take pictures mostly of Edith and her family , but that began to change in the early ' ' 70s , with the deaths of Edith 's grandmother and two of her uncles . With three of his most beloved in-laws gone , Gowin felt diminished . When he returned to visit with Edith 's family for Christmas in 1973 , he saw that some of the children had built a treehouse in the yard . " I just out of curiosity climbed up , " he says . " One plank had fallen out , and right in that spot there was a marvelous view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wedged his camera through the gap and took the only picture possible . It turned out to be a beautiful image , framed by snow-covered branches , looking out at the home of Edith 's deceased grandmother . He remembers feeling that " just getting up to a high place changed and liberated your vision . " That picture became the bridge between Gowin 's early work and the sort of photography that has absorbed him for the past few decades . Since 1980 , he has devoted himself largely to aerial landscapes-strip mining in the Czech Republic , farm fields in Kansas , apartment complexes in Jerusalem . These photographs , without a human being in sight , might seem a radical departure , but Gowin says no , they are " records of human action . " He is not interested in photographing pristine wildernesses , he adds , but in " tracing out all the lines humans have etched " in the land . And though Gowin 's focus has shifted , he has never stopped photographing Edith , who is now 64 , nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the body and personality that had agreed out of love to reveal itself , " Gowin wrote in 1976 . Now , at age 65 , he says , " My life as an artist follows so closely my meeting Edith and my love for her that I can think of no way of seeing these two separately . " Sidebar " She 'll look at me and see the way I 'm looking at her , and she 'll know , " Gowin says . " I just get up and go get the camera . " He recalls climbing into the treehouse : " Just getting up to a high place changed and liberated your vision . " Gowin says his landscapes ( above , Pivot Agriculture , Washington , 1987 ) are about " tracing out all the lines humans have etched . " But the sustaining thematic arc of his career has been his portraiture of Edith ( right , with Emmet in 2004 ) .
