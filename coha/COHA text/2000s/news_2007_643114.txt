<p> When Luca De Meo , 40 , became chief executive of the Italian carmaker FiatAutomobiles five years ago , one of his relatives  --  he forgets whether it was his aunt or his mother  --  told him , " Luca , you 've got to bring back the 500 , " or the Cinquecento , the chubby little car that symbolized Italy 's postwar economic miracle . <p> And now , following in the tire tracks of the latter-day Beetle from Volkswagen and the Mini Cooper from BMW , Fiat this month began selling an updated version of the classic 500 of 1957 . At 11 feet 6 inches in length , it is about 4 inches shorter than the Ka , Ford 's tiny runabout , but 18 inches longer than the original 500 . <p> More than a year before the car arrived , Fiat started marketing it as a return to everybody 's childhood . In Italy , advertisements appealed to patriotism , with slogans like , " The new Fiat belongs to all of us . " Fiat offers extras on the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag  --  red , white and green  --  and little Italian flags stitched into the upholstery . <p> In France , where the original 500 was lovingly known as the " pot de yaourt , " or pot of yogurt , for its soft shape , the ads read , " The new Fiat is your history too . " <p> In less than a month , Fiat has sold more than 57,000 of the cars . <p> The intrigue surrounding the 500 comes as carmakers in Europe are taking a new look at small autos . European cars have grown over the years , along with European pocketbooks , but with cities getting more congested and gasoline prices at $5 a gallon or higher , carmakers have been anticipating renewed interest in small cars . <p> Now the market is being flooded with such cars . BMW introduced an update of the Mini late last year , and Renault replaced its little Twingo in June . Daimler is preparing to send its tiny two-seater , the Smart , to North America , and most of the Japanese carmakers have what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All these new and retro models are hitting the market just as European car sales have flattened , creating a buyer 's market and forcing carmakers to devise ways to attract customers . <p> Many carmakers see retro models as the answer , because they are instantly recognizable and stir up nostalgia . <p> To some , like Marco Zurru , an auto industry consultant with Roland Berger , marketing a car like the 500 for its style is something of a paradox , because the original 500s were stylish by accident . <p> " Do n't forget , the original 500 sold four million cars , " Mr. Berger said . <p> At the same time , the new 500 is economical , borrowing a variety of components  --  including the platform , the engine , the transmission , the rear suspension , and most of the electrical and electronic equipment  --  from Fiat 's Panda , another compact car that is assembled with the 500 at Fiat 's big new plant in Tychy , Poland . Factory workers there make about $1,200 a month . <p> Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a 500 . ( As an extra , you can even buy a car cover printed to look like the old 500 of 1957 . ) <p> Bringing costs down further , Fiat is sharing the 500 's platform with Ford , which will shift assembly of its new Ka next year to the plant in Poland , from Valencia in Spain . <p> If the 500 is built differently , it is sold differently as well . Five hundred days before its introduction , Fiat asked potential buyers to enter a competition over the Web to design accessories for the car , and about 8,000 people did so . ( The prize ? Free accessories with the purchase of a 500 . ) Among the most popular of those customer-designed extras , at least in Italy , are a clear sunroof and the Italian colors as decoration . <p> The car has about 100 options , including hand-stitched leather steering wheel covers from the furniture maker Poltrona Frau , 11 colors , and 7 interior trims . Prices start at 10,500 euros , or about $14,400 , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 500 is safe , too , despite its diminutive size . It comes with seven air bags , helping to earn it five stars , the highest rating possible , in the standardized European frontal collision test . <p> " Like the Mini , you buy it because it 's interesting , beautiful things for the beautiful , " said Martino Boffa , the managing director in Milan of the marketing consultants Icon Added Value . He added , " It 's not functional ; it 's a luxury item ; it 's a toy . " <p> Mr. De Meo , who was a sales executive at Toyota and Renault before joining Fiat , compares the 500 to the Bic pen . " In the 1950s there was one Bic , and it was black , " he said . " Now there are 50 varieties . " <p> Luca Trazzi , whose design firm , designboom.com , organized the accessories competition , with a jury that included the fashion designer Giorgio Armani and Jasper Morrison , the industrial designer , said the 500 and the Mini were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new 500 , he said , has stoked demand for old ones , which were discontinued in 1974 . " People are paying double what you pay for a new 500 , for any kind of 500 , even 500s from the 1970s , " he said . <p> Of course , the new 500 has its critics in Europe . Reviewing the 500 for Le Monde , the French newspaper , Jean-Michel Normand asked whether " the neo-retro inspiration is the only path forward in producing original and desirable small cars . " He added , playfully , " So what is Citroen waiting for to give us a new 2CV ? , " referring to the classic 2-horsepower runabout . <p> To be sure , the 500 is a classic in North America . There are 500 clubs across the United States and Canada , as well as Web sites and blogs devoted to it . When the Pixar unit of Walt Disney released the animated film " Cars " last year , it featured a yellow 500 named Luigi , who spoke accented English and changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he has no plans to sell the 500 in the United States , lacking a distribution network , even though his boss , Sergio Marchionne , 55 , a native Italian who grew up and was educated in Canada , has said he wants Fiat to re-enter North America in 2009 with the Alfa Romeo brand . <p> Mr. De Meo says the 500 " will not be global in the strict sense , but will be for mature , sophisticated markets . " He added : " A product becomes global because its image is global . " <p> For all its global ambitions , Fiat has cast the introduction of the new 500 as a very Italian event . Daniele Cuniberto , the sales manager at Torino Auto , a dealership a short walk from the Fiat headquarters , said that stripes on the side in the Italian colors were the second most popular extra , exceeded only by the clear glass roof . <p> For Mr. Boffa of Icon Added Value , Fiat has made the 500 " a national event , saying , ' We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing in Italy , he went on , " arouses national sentiments . " <p> " There 's a moralizing , chauvinistic aspect . If you 're Italian , you have to buy a Fiat . " <p> Indeed , roughly one-third of all cars bought in Italy are Fiats . A local economic research firm , the Centro Einaudi , recently calculated that the Fiat Group , with its myriad businesses including farm and construction equipment , accounted for as much as 30 percent of Italy 's economic growth . <p> But will this work outside Italy ? Mr. Zurru of Roland Berger thinks so . " At least in Europe , " he said , " the 500 is linked to a cinematographic experience , a model rich in symbolism . " <p> " You know , " he said , " La Dolce Vita . " ##
