CULTURE WATCH Halloween has grown into a big deal  --  too big <p> One morning about this time last year I stopped at a coffee shop . The line moved peacefully along , until it was my turn to order . " What 'll it be ? " said the fellow behind the counter , still looking down at his cash register . " A chocolate croissant and a cup of  --  Aah ! " I yelled . The man had raised his head and was looking at me with yellow goat-eyes. " ... a cup of coffee , with milk , " I finished , shakily . He was , of course , wearing special-effect contact lenses . But I had forgotten that it was almost Halloween , and , as far as my atavistic self was concerned , I had just gazed into the eyes of a monster . For a split second , it was terrifying . <p> Forget soaring rates of obesity , bankruptcy , and out-of-wedlock births : By far the scariest statistic about contemporary American life is that people now spend more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from Christmas . We spend with abandon even when in the slough of national despond : In October 2001 , with Ground Zero still smoldering and the country questioning whether it would ever laugh again , Americans still bought over $6.9 billion on tubes of fake blood , plastic pumpkins , and ghoul costumes . Heaven knows what the wallet-letting will be this year . <p> " Mummy , look ! A circle of ghosts ! " <p> The children are straining against their seatbelts in excitement as we drive past the most egregious manifestation of Halloween 's new prominence : home decorating . Until the last five years or so  --  and I ca n't imagine what happened to change things  --  most Americans confined their Halloween celebrations to an orgy of candy-giving and - eating . But for whatever reason , the zeal to adorn homes with satanic images seized the national imagination . Lo , people began spiking witch hats and upside-down witch feet into their lawns to make it look as though a cauldron-stirrer had erred in her flight path and crashed straight into the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow ! " <p> We drive past a pretty white center-hall colonial festooned with plastic bats . A gruesome hanged man made of stuffed clothing swings from the limb of an oak tree . I speed up and hope the ardent young hearts behind me wo n't notice . <p> " Wait , Mummy , they 've got a graveyard in their yard ! " <p> I dread this time of year . It 's not that I oppose the wearing of charming costumes by young children . My son Paris 's outfit when he was five still ranks among the world 's dearest . He wore a dark-green turtleneck ( which he already had ) , dark-green trousers ( ditto ) , and on to these we stapled cardboard lightning bolts covered with aluminum foil . He was the only electric eel in a class full of store-bought Pokmons . Nor do I question the rightness of shoving barrels of salt-water taffy down young throats . Goodness knows , I like a sugary tidbit on occasion , and my children can imagine nothing nicer than a sack of individually wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What gets my sacrificial goat is that Halloween is n't about anything . It 's not about death , or life , or fall , or The Fall , or family , or patriotic love of country . It is a completely content-free , dark-caped , sugar-frosted bacchanal in a society that already , every day , gives people license to be content-free , sugar-frosted , and to dress however gothically they like  --  and that includes children . <p> The fact that I lost this battle when the children entered nursery school may explain my acidity . But when I was a girl , Halloween did n't involve obligatory full-school parades , pre-trick-or-treat parties for parents in fancy dress , or coffee jockeys with caprine contact lenses . <p> Halloween was a low-grade thrill experienced chiefly by the very young . We made costumes with the contents of our dress-up trunks , assembled our school-distributed UNICEF boxes , and marched out into the dusk to petition the neighbors for coins and sweets . Rumors abounded of men who slipped razors into apples , so we avoided mansard-roofed houses . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , chewy , and crunchy  --  try to trade away those wax-paper-wrapped maple-nut toffees , and go to bed . <p> Now Halloween is epic-length , parents pay a fortune on mass-produced costumes , and the celebrants who spend most , oddly , fall in marketers ' coveted 25-34 age range ( the age more of partying than parenting ) . Through cunning marketing on the part of stuff-producers , and a dismaying weakness in the American character for stuff-buying , Halloween now " represents the beginning of a new season , not just one holiday , " according to Tracy Mullin , president of the National Retail Federation . Spider rings ! Frankenstein windsocks ! Decorative skull lawnbags with twist ties ! Every year there 's more , and every year it arrives on the shelves a little earlier . <p> A scene from not so long ago : I am pushing a shopping cart filled with my children through a Connecticut supermarket . It is lovely outside , hot and sunny . We are wearing bathing suits under our clothes . <p> " Look , Mummy , candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monstrous heap of chocolates wrapped in black and orange foil . <p> " Halloween candy ? ! " I exclaim , not quite taking in what I am seeing . <p> " Candy ! " cries Violet , who 's three . <p> " Andy ! " echoes Phoebe , who 's two . <p> " Can you believe it , Mummy ? " Molly says scornfully , gesturing at a stack of orange spheres further down the aisle . " Jack-o ' - lanterns in August ! " <p> When a nine-year-old can see through the phoniness of pushing late-October goods in the heat of summer , it must be phony indeed . We rattle disdainfully past the mounds of cheap Halloween candy , all of which , I am sure , has been gathering dust on warehouse pallets for the last ten months . <p> I blame the Irish . The heathen Celts celebrated Samhain , Lord of Darkness , in late autumn . That festival was co-opted by Christianity and became All Hallow 's Eve , the night before All Saint 's Day , which it remains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old peasant practice  --  and Ireland brought us the tale of Jack-o ' - the- Lantern , a shiftless Paddy condemned eternally to walk the earth with only a hollowed-out turnip to light his way ( it became a pumpkin after large numbers of Jack 's people landed at Ellis Island ) . October 31 was for hundreds of years a time to remember the loved and sainted dead , but has long since degenerated into the confused revelry we know today . <p> At school , I whip ' round the mothers to ask why they celebrate Halloween . " It 's a Hallmark-created holiday , " laughs Allison , who likes the tradition but limits her boys ' costumes to the non-funereal . " But c'm on , it 's fun for the kids . " <p> " I do n't like the dark , witchy undercurrents of Halloween , " says Melissa , " but when else do you see high-and-mighty people in clown wigs ? " <p> " I do n't know what it means . We do n't do it in Brazil , " says Kareen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart from Wiccans , who have their own lavender-tinged , Celt-promoting agenda , it 's hard to find anyone who knows why Americans now celebrate Halloween with such vigor . Yet you see middle-class women rummaging furiously through piles of made-in-China lion suits at $12.99 apiece to find the right size for their 18-month-olds . Step into a fabric store , and you will see mothers taking down bolts of cloth suitable for their little Grim Reapers , Gypsies , and Draculas . When they zip those costumes over their children and march out into the night , what do they think they 're doing ? <p> Do n't get me wrong . Americans should be free to buy what they want , even inflatable skeletons and glow-in-the-dark vampire teeth . I also think that adults should have more fancy-dress parties , not fewer , especially elegant ones . <p> But there are two utterly creepy things about Halloween , quite apart from its glamorization of demons and axe-murderers . The first is that it 's a trumped-up festival of nothingness  --  as if our attention spans were so short that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thanksgiving . The second is that for nearly a month every year , Halloween infantilizes the entire country . Giggly pleasure in dress-ups and sweets is fetching in children . But when it overwhelms a great portion of the autumn , and otherwise grown-up people enter into the supposed " spirit " without having any idea why they do so , then it becomes a piece of sustained and irritating whimsy . <p> That 's Halloween for you in a pumpkin-shell : sweet enough for children , but when adults join in , it 's just plain childish . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Meghan Cox Gurdon <p> <p> Mrs. Gurdon 's column , " The Fever Swamp , " appears Fridays on National Review Online . <p>
