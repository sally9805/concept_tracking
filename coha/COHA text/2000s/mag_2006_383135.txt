Patrick first garnered our attention in the ' ' 80s , playing nerd-makes-good roles in flicks like 1987 's Ca n't Buy Me Love . That same year , he married his 48-year-old manager Rocky Parker . He was 21 . By 1994 , that marriage was over , and it seemed like his career might be too .

Cosmo How did a teenager from rural Maine become a Hollywood star by 19 ? PD When I was 15 or 16 , I wanted to be an Olympic skier , so I bought a unicycle because I heard it improved your balance . Then I started juggling and touring with these clowns and won a TV talent contest in New York with my juggling act . From that , I got an agent and , three weeks later , landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fierstein . Doors just opened really fast from there . C Things slowed down for you after Ca n't Buy Me Love . What happened ? P I went through about a decade of rejection . It was like " You blew your opportunity . " And that 's when the real work began . I went back into acting classes but still was n't consistently getting anything . It was a difficult period , having it all and then having nothing . C Grey 's Anatomy turned your career around , to say the least . How does it feel ? P This was the fifth pilot I 'd done , and I had no idea it would be something people would talk about at the water cooler . I completely appreciate it . And now I 'm on the cover oi'Cawio ! We always have Cosmo at our house , so my being on the cover is surreal . C What 's the bravest thing you 've done in your life ? P I think it was getting married the second time . It 's a huge commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you meet your wife ? P This singer I knew suggested I get my hair cut by Jill Fink at Delux . I went in and saw this girl and was like " She 's so hot and sexy ! " And that was Jill . She was just a classic , gorgeous beauty . And when I sat down to have my hair cut , I could n't even speak for a while . She was with somebody at the time , and I was too-so it was five years before we went out . She 's changed my life profoundly , in a positive way . She was the first person who was really there for me . C What do you think is the key to making a marriage work in Hollywood ? P To always be communicating . That 's the hardest thing for me ... not retreating inside myself .

Have you ever been cheated on ? P Yeah . It was in a prior relationship , when I was married the first time , it 's an interesting thing , being cheated on . It destroys your ego and hurts you . It makes you feel inadequate . C Hove you ever cheated ? P In my first marriage , we both cheated . Cheating is not a winning situation . You 're better off having the flirtation than the reality of cheating because it 's not fulfilling for anybody . It destroys your ability to look at yourself in the mirror and say " I 'm a good person . " You look at yourself in the mirror and say " You 're an asshole , " because you 're dishonest .

The male energy is tough enough to restrain as it is . Men want to chase , to conquer . And I think in your 20s , it 's very hard to control those emotions and those temptations . As you get older , you see the stupidity of it . C What did you learn about women from growing up with your three sisters ? P They 're very emotional . And thanks to my mom and sisters , who are all very different and very strong , I 've learned how to navigate their emotions . I think it 's funny that I have this character who 's surrounded by women too . C When it comes to sex , were you an early or late bloomer ? P I lost my virginity when I was 17 . I like sex . It 's important to have a lot of sex because if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to have great , hot sex , and you have to experiment with your partner .

C You recently filmed a steamy shower scene with your costar , Ellen Pompeo . Was it as sexy as it looked ? P No . You just drink a lot of Scotch to get yourself used to the fact that you 're walking around in a flesh-toned thong , and 20 people are watching you make out with someone you barely know . C Are you two friends now ? P Yeah , she 's from Boston , and when I heard her accent , I was like " I love you ! You 're a New England girl . " I really like working with her . We have great chemistry , and I think it 's why the show is the way it is .. . because we get along . Patrick and his wife , Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their 30s .
