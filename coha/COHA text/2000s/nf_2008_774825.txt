The One Day When This Lady Met This Fellow // I wish my mother had been alive for my fiftieth birthday . I think my attitude would have surprised her . Rather than dreading the half-century milestone , I celebrated it . I embraced the idea of getting older . My family was around me all day . At night , they brought out a big cake and I blew out candles . We toasted ? . ? . ? . ? me ! // I said silly things like " fifty is nifty . " Several reporters called , wanting to know how Marcia Brady felt about turning fifty . Politely , I reminded them that Marcia Brady was still a teenager , but I , Maureen , created not in Sherwood Schwartz 's imagination but in the womb of Irene McCormick , felt okay about it . // And no , I responded to another frequently asked question , I had n't had any plastic surgery and did n't plan to . I borrowed Flip Wilson 's line : What you see is what you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd heaped on my body over the years , gravity had been kind to me . I did n't have many wrinkles , at least none that were undeserved . I had few complaints . // But those questions got me thinking . Why would I get surgically pulled , stretched , and Botoxed ? When I looked in the mirror , I wanted to see me . The real me  --  warts , wrinkles , and everything else . I 'd gone through hell and back to get to a place where I could , and indeed wanted to , look at myself  --  and like what I saw . // My mother had spent nearly her entire life doing the opposite , hiding from her past and trying to avoid the truth . It clouded much that she should 've liked . A stay-at-home mother , she was a hard worker , with a good sense of people , good morals , and a good business sense . // Before the end , she came around and was much better and happier for it . By then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in 1921 in Burlington , Iowa , a small town along the Mississippi settled by German immigrants . Her father contracted syphilis while serving overseas during World War I , and he passed it on to her mother . She entered a mental institution with extreme paresis and died there without being able to recognize my mother or her younger sister . // A week after she entered the institution , my mom 's father locked himself in the garage and breathed the exhaust fumes from his car . He died leaving his two girls inside the house . My mother was ten years old when she lost both of her parents . She and her sister moved in with an aunt and uncle . They were dedicated , devoted , and loving people . They provided my mother and her sister with a loving , nurturing home , though small-town life being what it was , my mother and her younger sister were still subjected to scorn . A year later , she was diagnosed with syphilis , an event that scarred her more psychologically than physically for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd inherited the disease at birth from her mother . Following the diagnosis , she was warned not to tell anyone , ever , lest she be branded diseased and dirty . She did n't have to be told . From that first moment on , she felt dirty and diseased . It was the most shameful thing in the world to her . She was also frightened that she 'd end up in an institution like her mother . // She was treated with stovarsol and mercury capsules , though both treatments caused a bad rash and later a more extreme skin condition . She ate her meals off a separate set of dishes . It was like wearing a scarlet A , only worse . At thirteen , she began special treatments at the State University of Iowa in Iowa City to ensure she would never pass the syphilis on to any children she might have . Those treatments lasted for three years and required long and lonely bus rides . // " At the time of her last visit here , on December 28 , 1938 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking mercury and chalk fairly regularly , and had been going to her local physician for weekly Bismuth shots , " her doctor wrote in a report . " Physical examination at the time of her last visit revealed a well-developed , well-nourished female . She was quite cooperative but acted rather self-consciously. " // Despite everything , she did well in school , worked numerous odd jobs , and put herself through business college . She blossomed into a beautiful , intelligent , ambitious young woman . On the one hand , I picture her sitting on those long bus rides to the hospital : alone , scared , praying no one found out about her condition . On the other hand , I marvel at the strength she must have had ; though she did n't show it , she was the strongest woman I 've ever met. // At twenty , she fell in love and married a soldier who was immediately shipped off to Europe . A week later , he was killed in World War II when a German U-boat sank the transport ship he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast with her best girlfriend , Mary Crawley . They wanted to live in Hollywood , among the movie stars and fancy theaters . They dreamed of adventure , maybe even stardom . But they ended up fifteen miles away in Westwood , near UCLA . My mom did n't care . She was happy to be out of Burlington and away from the stares and stigma of her past . // My father , Richard , was the youngest of three children born to Joseph McCormick , a bartender in Riverside , New Jersey . His father was a heavy drinker who abused his wife . He lost everything in the Depression and died in his mid-thirties from illnesses related to alcoholism . // My father 's mother did the best she could to raise her family , but they were very poor and at one point they had to burn furniture to keep warm in the winter . My dad spent most of his youth in a wheelchair , the result of osteomyelitis . By his late teens , though , his illness was gone . Near the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and joined the Coast Guard . One day he was on deck , cooking for his shipmates , and his gas stove exploded , severely burning his leg . //
