KIDS LOVE VIGOROUS ACTIVITY . THEIR BODIES ARE HARDwired for it , and-as any mother who 's spent a rainy weekend indoors knows-when they ca n't run free , they go crazy . Exercise helps children in a number of physical ways : It builds large-muscle strength , improves eye-hand coordination , fosters good balance , and increases flexibility . It also has emotional benefits : When kids master a new activity as they grow , they 'll feel confident . Plus , the rush they get from active fun lasts long after they come in from the playground . The best way to get children moving : Get out there with them and show them how great it feels by playing with them and concocting activities . Some ways to jump-start the fun : TODDLERS The Kangaroo Game Toddlers love jumping , so have them follow your directions as you recite this ditty : " Kangaroo , kangaroo . Jump , jump , jump : ' Then replace the jumping with other moves , such as " Hop up high , " " Roll over , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . " ( Be sure to do this in a safe area , such as a carpeted family room or a grassy yard . ) Freeze and MeIt Get your child running around in a large area free of sharp corners and with no hard floor . When you say " Freeze ! " he has to stand still . In a few seconds , say " Melt ! " and have him make another physical move-say , " Hop on one foot " or " Shake your arms and body " - until you say " Freeze ! " again . Repeat until you 're both pooped . Photograph SUPER STRETCHER Crawl over and under bridges and hills // Bridges and hills This is a great way for both parents and kids to do some stretching . First make a bridge with your body and have your child slither under you . Then make a hill and have her climb over you : Then give her a chance to be both bridge and ; hill . Animal Imitations Play a wildlife version of follow-the-leader . With your toddler in tow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a buffalo stampeding across the grassland , a giraffe reaching to nibble a leaf at the top of a tree , a cheetah stretching after a long nap in the sun , a crocodile slithering through the mud . PRESCHOOLERS Walking 's great exercise , but it can be boring , especially for preschoolers . Jazz up a stroll through your neighborhood by asking your child to do silly walks : fast , slow , sore leg , tiptoe , backward , and so on . For extra fun , join in , and mix in hopping , running , and walking sideways . Backyard Obstacle Course Litter , your yard with items that your child has to walk on ( a string ) , step over ( a piece of fabric ) , jump over ( a stick ) , step into ( a box drawn with chalk ) , run around ( a picnic table ) , or throw a ball into ( a basket ) . The older the child , the more objects you can include . Just make sure that you set up the obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway . Hold one end of a jump rope while your child holds the other . Both of you run as you " tow " her with the rope , or as she tows you . Other jump-rope games to try : the human yo-yo ( child holds one end of the rope , and parent wraps the remainder around her waist , then gently pulls on the end so she spins in place to unwind ) ; tightrope walking ( lay the rope on the floor and have her walk along it ) ; and the ski hop ( lay the rope on the floor and have her jump over it from side to side , just as a skier weaves between slalom gates ) . Living Room Safari Draw and cut out various animal footprints-from the big ones of an elephant to the tiny ones of a gazelle . Lay them out around the house and invite your child to track the various animals around the couch , past the dining table , through the hallway , and up the stairs . It 's even more fun when two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks cross over each other . SCHOOL-AGERS Crazy Olympics You and your child can devise and compete in your own sporting events based on Olympic competitions . Instead of hurling a javelin , try the leaf toss : How far can he throw a handful of leaves ? Expand the competition with a round-theblock mini-marathon , a bicycle race , or walking down a chalk-drawn balance beam in the driveway . Photograph TOWING THE LINE A rope is for way more than just jumping ! // Scarf Dance Give your child a scarf or a square piece of fabric , put on some lively music , and let the dancing begin : She can swirl the cloth , toss it in the air and watch it drop , wrap you in it and then unwind you , and choreograph her own dance . Ball Toss Arrange a variety of containers of differing sizes-flowerpots , bushel baskets , plastic containers , and so on-in a group . Offer kids an array of balls , from Ping-Pong to tennis to big plastic ones , that they can toss into the containers . Older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills . Obstacle Race See who can finish this circuit/obstacle race faster-you or your child : Jump rope 10 times , then do 10 jumping jacks , S bent-knee situps , 5 push-ups , a run down the length of the driveway and back , and anything else that comes to mind . To make it more challenging , add more obstacles , such as Hula Hoops to jump into , a rope to slither under , and a chalk-drawn hopscotch board .
