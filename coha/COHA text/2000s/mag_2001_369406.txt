A year ago in the buckhead section of Atlanta , in the early hours of Monday , a long-running post-Super Bowl party was breaking up at the posh Cobalt Lounge . A scuffle between two groups turned into a fight ; a Champagne bottle was broken over someone 's head ; two men fell . Jacinth Baker , 21 , and Richard Lollar , 24 , had been knifed and were dying . A big man who had tried to break up the fight jumped into a limo , which wheeled away as shots rang out . The man 's name was Ray Lewis , and he was heading into a year that would see him reach the depths  --  shackled , in solitary , roused in the dead of night to make sure he had n't killed himself  --  and then climb to the heights . On Sunday , Lewis , 25 , star linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens , will play in the game he watched a year ago , and the only trouble he 'll cause will be between the sidelines . <P> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up poor in the roughest of Florida Panhandle neighborhoods . He had , earlier in the evening , been strutting in a white mink , having been chauffeured from the game to the club in that stretch Lincoln Navigator limo . His company included Joseph Sweeting , who had befriended Lewis when he was a college star with the Miami Hurricanes ; and Reginald Oakley , a newer friend , from Baltimore , Md. , the one who took the Champagne bottle on the head . " They were guys who would come over to Ray 's during the season , and they 'd ride together in the limo to a game , " says Donald Samuel , an attorney who represented Lewis after the athlete , along with Sweeting and Oakley , had been indicted for double murder . " Ray had some wrong friends . " Several were among the 10 who piled into the Lincoln when it became an escape car . <P> When police picked up Lewis at a friend 's house outside Atlanta , he was uncooperative . " He lied about everything , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that juncture in his life , for him to trust cops more than his friends . He had been cited four previous times for participating in brawls , batteries or assaults and had never been tried . This time he was cuffed , booked and put in jail for two weeks . He likens the days to " hell . " He did n't call his five-year-old son Ray-Ray , because he did not want to have to explain what the boy had seen on television : his dad in leg irons , being led from court . <P> Lewis ' legal team knew from the get-go that things were not as they might have seemed in the hazy dawn of that awful Monday . " It was a weak prosecution , " says Samuel . " I 'm not blaming the police . A guy departs the scene and then does n't cooperate  --  it looks bad . But witness after witness said Ray did nothing , and the prosecution would n't let it go . " <P> Throughout the ordeal , Lewis ' focus on football became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , crush them to strengthen his arms , " remembers Samuel . " The entire trial , day after day , his hands were under the table exercising . He 'd leave court and go work out . " <P> Lewis had not killed the men , and finally the prosecution had to buckle . In June , in exchange for his testimony against Oakley and Sweeting ( who were subsequently acquitted ) , Lewis pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice .
