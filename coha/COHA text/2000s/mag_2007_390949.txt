Casual hookups , mixed signals , drugs , and alcohol  --  they all play a part in a confusing form of sexual assault . Cosmo examines everything you need to know about what some people are calling gray rape . Alicia* has been out of college for three years , and by most measures , she 's doing great : She has a good job as a consultant , a high-rise condo , and a boyfriend her friends envy . But in one disquieting way , she has not been able to leave her college self behind . She is haunted by the memory of something that occurred one night years ago  --  a sexual encounter and an unanswered question : Was I raped ? This is what happened : Alicia had asked another student , Kevin , to be her " platonic date " at a college sorority formal . The two of them went out for dinner first with friends and then to the dance . She remembers that they got drunk but not what she would call sloppy wasted . Photograph : What really happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance , they went to Kevin 's room and , eventually , started making out . She told him flat out that she did n't want it to proceed to sex , and he said okay . But in a few minutes , he had pushed her down on the couch and positioned himself on top of her . " No . Stop , " she said softly  --  too softly , she later told herself . When he ignored her and entered her anyway , she tensed up and tried to go numb until it was over . He fell asleep afterward , and she left for her dorm , " having this dirty feeling of not knowing what to do or who to tell or whether it was my fault . " While it felt like rape to her  --  she had not wanted to have sex with Kevin  --  she was not sure if that 's what anyone else would call it . " It fell into a gray area , " she said recently . " Maybe I was n't forceful enough in saying I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call it rape because she thinks of herself as a strong and sexually independent woman , not a victim . Alicia 's " gray area " experience is something that is becoming so common , it has earned its own moniker : gray rape . It refers to sex that falls somewhere between consent and denial and is even more confusing than date rape because often both parties are unsure of who wanted what . Photograph : Lamar S. Owens Jr . ( left , in &shy; uniform ) was acquitted of raping a fellow Naval Academy student . And it 's a surprisingly common occurrence . The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that 1 in 5 college women will be raped at some point during a five-year college career ; that about 9 out of 10 times , the victim will know her assailant ; and that half of all victims will not call what happened rape . Sixty-two percent of female rape victims in general say they were assaulted by someone they knew , which includes dates , acquaintances , and random hookups . Many experts feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hookup culture : lots of partying and flirting , plenty of alcohol , and ironically , the idea that women can be just as bold and adventurous about sex as men are . How can something so potentially empowering become so damaging ? Cosmo investigates . BLURRED BOUNDARIES A generation ago , it was easier for men and women to understand what constituted rape because the social rules were clearer . Men were supposed to be the ones coming on to women , and women were said to be looking for relationships , not casual sex . But those boundaries and rules have been loosening up for decades , and now lots of women feel it 's perfectly okay to go out looking for a hookup or to be the aggressor , which may turn out fine for them  --  unless the signals get mixed or misread . Shari Rosen , a media recruiter in New York City , found that out on a business trip to Los Angeles . She and a coworker met a man in the bar of the hotel where they were staying . They ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he and Shari returned to the hotel . On the way in , he kissed her deeply . They had a few more drinks at the hotel bar , and then he asked if she wanted to go to his hotel room to see some family photos . She went to his room but after a few minutes said she needed to go . He pinned her on the bed and , according to Shari , sexually assaulted her . She struggled with him and managed to escape . Shari reported the incident to police but did n't press charges . Later , she started working on a documentary about rape and , in the process of interviewing rape victims , discovered that a lot of them felt they had contributed somewhat to what happened . Because they thought they were ( or should be ) in control of their bodies and desires , says Shari , " they 'd say things like " I should have done this " or " I should n't have been in that situation . ' But they 'd also say , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have backed off . ' ' " In gray-rape cases , it 's even easier than in more clear-cut date rapes for women to blame themselves : " If only I had n't gone to that party , this would n't have happened " or " If I had n't worn such a revealing top and come on to that hot guy .... " Laura Taylor , who just graduated from Cornell University , understands why a woman in this predicament might second-guess herself . When she was a sophomore , she met a fellow student at a frat party . They drank , they flirted , and then he invited her to his apartment . There , they kissed for a while , and things got more heated until Laura realized that he was taking off her underwear and entering her . She was drunk , but she says she was aware enough to say no . When he ignored her , she froze  --  a common response , much like Alicia 's  --  and he continued to have sex with her . After he finished , she put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . " I knew something was off , but I would n't have called it rape , " she recalls . That 's what her roommate called it a day later , however , insisting that Laura call the sexual-assault hotline . Even after the hotline counselor assured her that what had occurred was rape , Laura could n't stop asking herself questions like " Why did n't I scream ? " " Why did n't I take him on ? " ( She 's almost 6 feet tall . ) Laura did n't press charges against her assailant . " SHE WANTED IT " The odd thing about the current equal-opportunity hookup culture is that a lot of guys may feel as uncomfortable and confused as their dates do when things end up in bed . Anthony Moniello , 24 , a radio personality for ESPN , says , " I 've had girls tell me " I do n't have sex on the first night . ' And I say , " That 's fine , I respect that . Mind if I play with you a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mind , then she 'll get so hot , she 'll say , " Let 's do it . " That 's the scariest part . Is it then my responsibility to say no ? " One male student at George Washington University , a senior , recounted to the student newspaper that he had woken up naked and drunk next to a girl he did n't know . His friends later told him that the girl had bought him drinks the night before and volunteered to take him home . He ended up feeling taken advantage of  --  that he would n't have hooked up with her if he had n't been so wasted . Another senior at GW expressed his confusion like this : " Sometimes I 'll feel like a girl is n't sure , but then she 'll say yes and I 'll think she 's just being coy . If you regret it or she regrets it , does that make it assault ? " But then there are guys who will admit that they find the whole hookup culture secretly freeing . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " allows guys to be assholes " by hiding behind the " she wanted it , she went after me " excuse . THE ALCOHOL FACTOR All of these complicated scenarios are made even more so by drinking , which is almost always part of the mix . Heavy drinking is a major factor in sexual assaults , and young women 's drinking habits have risen almost to the level of men 's . This makes them more vulnerable to guys who are pushing for sex . In one study of college women by the Harvard School of Public Health , nearly 3 out of 4 rape victims were intoxicated when the assault occurred , a pattern that appears to continue as women move through their 20s . " Women 's self-esteem at that age is tied into how they are experienced by men , and part of dealing with that social anxiety is to drink it away or drug it away , " says New York City psychotherapist Robi Ludwig , PsyD . " They say to themselves that it 'll work out okay , with some thinking that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Brett Sokolow , a Malvern , Pennsylvania , attorney who specializes in sexual assault , if a woman is drunk or otherwise incapable of making a sound decision , then a man who knowingly has sex with her in that condition is indeed guilty of rape . But rape cases where drinking or drugs are involved are difficult to prove in a criminal court if the victim can not remember whether she gave consent or if she blacked out and her partner claims she gave consent , says Sokolow . Last year , a 20-year-old female midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy reported that the academy 's star quarterback , Lamar S. Owens Jr. , raped her . She filed charges and , in a July 2006 court-martial of Owens , said that she had been drinking and could recall very little beyond waking up in her bed in the middle of the night to find Owens having sex with her . Owens testified that she had invited him to her room during an instant-message conversation , and that after a few caresses , they began to have sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding , and he left her room . The young woman testified that she could not remember sending the messages to Owens and that someone had closed the instant-message window on her computer , so they were n't retrievable . A toxicologist for the defense reportedly said that the young woman 's blood-alcohol level showed that she was legally intoxicated , which means she may not have been able to give consent . Nonetheless , the rape charge against Owens was dropped because the five officers on the military jury believed that evidence indicated he had been invited to her room . During his testimony , Owens reportedly said it was a case not of rape but of " sex going bad . " PAINFUL AFTEREFFECTS The psychological effects of what a victim did or did n't do can last for years . " I still panic when a guy is on top of me and positions his body so that I feel restricted , even if we are just making out , " says Alicia . " I have punched a guy because he had innocently placed himself on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or doing their schoolwork , adopt unhealthy eating patterns , turn to drugs , or attempt suicide . Others may start quickly seeking out new sex partners . " They think that this is the way they can prove that the assault did n't affect them , " explains Catherine Busch , PhD , clinical director of the Specialized Trauma Treatment and Recovery Center in Columbia , Maryland , who works with sexual-assault victims . So how do you avoid being a victim without giving up the right to be sexually independent and assertive ? Many psychologists feel that the first step is to acknowledge the dangers inherent in the free-and-easy hookup approach to dating and sex . " We all have vulnerabilities , and we all can be taken advantage of , " says Ludwig . " Though you 're successful at school , sports , whatever , you must see yourself  --  as a woman  --  as vulnerable . If you do n't , you 're at greater risk . " Sarah Belanger , 28 , a communications specialist who works in Boston , has been trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make the choice to leave the bar with the guy , then you are also creating the opportunity for something to go wrong , " she says . " I think that is the point that needs to be driven home to everyone who participates in the hookup culture . Yes , you can practice safe sex . Yes , you can have casual sex without strings . But this behavior carries a risk . " And if something bad does happen , says Laura , seek help immediately , and do n't blame yourself . " It was incredibly empowering for me to say " I 'm a survivor of rape . ' ' " Avoiding the Gray Area Recognize Male Mind Games Beware of statements that make him sound as if he is only thinking of you , such as " I just want to get you off . " Also , be wary of those designed to make you feel guilty , like " You 're going to give me blue balls if you do n't .... " ( He can always relieve himself later . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure how far you really want things to go or confident enough to follow through . Be Straightforward and Clear Telling a partner what you want  --  and do n't want  --  to do is more likely to protect you than assuming you can show him . He may not get the hint . Know Your Rights Under the law , a guy has to get a clear verbal or nonverbal yes from you to have sex . Just because you consent to one sexual activity ( making out , even with few clothes on ) does not mean you have given permission for any other . Also , silence does n't always equal consent , nor does being too drunk to know what you 're doing . <p>
