Chapter 1 <p> September 20 , 1990 <p> The law offices of Pohlmann , McIntyre , Sorensen andFrost surrounded a courtyard in a low , white-painted adobe building in the town of Carmel-by-the-Sea , California . Lush flower bushes , pines , and succulents bedecked the hilly front yard where steps led to the main door . In the bright sun of mid-September the building looked overexposed , bleached like the sand on the beach at the foot of Ocean Avenue . Now , at ten in the morning , streams of Lexuses and Infinitis already cruised this side street , hungry for parking spaces . <p> Nina Reilly grabbed a pile of mail on the receptionist 's desk . She had worked as a paralegal at the law firm for the past year , having snagged this coveted job simply by submitting a rTsumT . Her mother called it Irish luck , but Nina suspected it had more to do with another Irish character trait . Her father , Harlan , knew Klaus Pohlmann because he hobnobbed with everyone , but he would never confess to having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a legend in the community , the most daring and successful lefty lawyer south of San Francisco . He only hired the best , and that included Jack McIntyre , Nina 's latest crush . Jack was over at the Monterey County Superior Court at a settlement conference . <p> Nina called out to the receptionist , " Back in an hour , Astrid . I promise . " <p> Hurrying down the walk , she caught her sandal on the edge of the stone steps and stopped herself from falling by dropping the mail and raising her arms for balance . She dusted the letters as she picked them up , then tossed them through the car window to the seat , counting to keep track in case one fell between the seat and gearshift . <p> Could mean the difference between a future and no future at all , getting every one of those envelopes to the post office . If she was going to be sloppy about details , she might as well slit her throat today and skip the stomachaches and nights of worry altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture , a minor oversight could be lethal . <p> Nina had finished college a few years before with a degree in psychology , studying film , art , and people in the luxurious fashion of a girl-child awaiting her prince . She wished now that she 'd had better guidance from the adults in her life , who should have known  --  what ? The future , what real life held for a single mother in her late twenties entering a slow economy ? Her psych degree had not even prepared her for service positions in the restaurant business . <p> But she was making up for that now , between law classes , paralegal work , and Bob , not in that order . Fog murked its way in front of her . She scrutinized the hazy road for patrol cars , then executed a swooping , illegal U-turn , arriving at the post office in downtown Pacific Grove , heart pounding . She shoved the letters into the metered-mail slot . <p> Relieved to be rid of her latest emergency , she fired up the MG along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowly missed a waiting Acura . She swung onto Pine Avenue , drifting toward the middle line as she rummaged in her bag for the address for Dr. Lindberg . She located his card , swerved to avoid a jaywalking tourist family , and turned left onto Highway 1 . The pines loomed on either side as the fog drizzled over the Pebble Beach road . She drove swiftly the few blocks to her mother 's cottage , parking in front of the huge Norfolk pine in the front yard . <p> Honking , she reminded herself about the miserable people she saw every day at work , injured on the job , alone and poor . She conjured these images to steel herself for the sight of her mother carefully locking up , pausing every few steps , looking down as if she were n't sure where the sidewalk was . Her mother had ordered her not to come to the door . She did n't like being reminded of the changes in her health . <p> In the one minute she had to herself Nina leaned back and closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's see , Wills and Estates tonight . Professor Cerruti made it her favorite class , but she also liked what lawyers called the " settled " law of that ancient and noble subject . Unlike environmental law , for instance , which fluxed through revolutions every time a new president came in , with Wills one could learn rules that had stuck for centuries . How nice if she could apply a few firm rules to the tatty loose ends of her own life . <p> I 'll read the cases while I eat dinner , she decided . So much for school . As for work , she had all afternoon to obsess about how much she was falling behind there . Deal with it when she got back to the office . <p> As for friends , ha ha , they must think she had moved to Tajikistan , for all they ever heard from her ; a boyfriend was not an option , she did n't have time , though she had fallen into some casual overnighters a while back that had left her feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McIntyre came into her office . Her mind began bathing in a certain bubble bath  --  but right now here came her mother , struggling down the concrete walk . <p> Today , the skin on her mother 's face looked tighter than usual . Nina opened the passenger-side door from the inside . Ginny paused to remove her right glove , uncovering a hand scrimshawed in pale blue lines . She leaned in and touched her daughter 's hand . " Honey , why not let me take a cab ? You 're a busy woman . " <p> " God , Mom . You 're like ice . " <p> Nina 's mother had changed so much . Always a handsome woman with sparkling eyes and a daunting energy , she had gradually seemed to lose all color and character . Her skin stretched as tight as a stocking mask over her cheekbones , even pulling her lips back as if they were shrinking . Her once mobile face now looked somehow both flat and puffy , due to both the illness and the steroids used to treat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always look so cheerful , " Nina said , giving her a brief hug after she had maneuvered into the low-slung car . " How do you do it ? " <p> " The right attitude makes me feel stronger . You know how much you hate it when people condescend to you , ' Oh , poor Nina , raising a boy on her own , working so hard ' ? " <p> " Oh , come on . I do n't pity you . " <p> " Sure you do . Anyone with half a brain would . " Ginny patted her shoulder . " Let 's just admire how delightful the leaves are at this time of year , okay ? " <p> Maybe it had been better , those days of not knowing what was wrong , because of the hope they 'd had then . Did her mother still hope ? <p> Nina drove quickly to Dr. Lindberg 's Monterey office on Cass Street . Would she have time later to run by the school library for that book on reserve ? She had a mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procedure class and a paper due for Gas and Oil Law that demanded lengthy research . If she hurried , she could pick up Bob at nursery school , drop him with the babysitter at home , stop by the library , and be back at the office by two . Would Remy notice she had been gone longer than her lunch break allowed ? <p> Gritting her teeth , she thought , Remy would notice . <p> She parked at a meter and ran around to the side of the car . " Need help , Mom ? Those stairs are pretty steep . Let me help you up them at least . " <p> Her mother let her help her out of the car , then shook her off . " I rise to all occasions . That will never change . Please do n't fuss so much , Nina . " <p> " If Matt does n't show up to pick you up , promise me you 'll leave a message for me with Astrid . I 'll come get you . " <p> " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matt . Nina hoped she would call if Matt did n't show up . Again . <p> A few blocks north of Dr. Lindberg 's office , Bob attended a preschool chosen after Nina had looked at a dozen of them and settled on this one as the least of all evils . The playroom walls were covered with outsider art Picasso would have envied , committed by three- and four-year-olds who were never given fill-in-the-blanks coloring books . Children were making collages at each table , and she spotted Bob , dark hair fallen over his round , delicious cheeks , smearing a magazine tearout onto gluey paper a la AndrT Breton or Max Ernst . <p> Seeing her , he called out , " Mom , look ! " Resisting an impulse to check her watch , she pulled up a tiny preschooler plastic chair and sat next to him , nodding at the collage . <p> " Finish up , honey , we have to go . " Thank God he loved the place and was reluctant to leave . " What 's this ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the collage . <p> " My job . " He reached over and with startling dexterity stuck the pieces into their slots to complete a duck puzzle . <p> " Oh . A duck ! Cool ! " <p> " But now watch this . " He dumped the pieces onto the table , then stuck them across the middle in a snaggletooth row . " My keyboard , " he said with a grin . " Like at home . " <p> " But this one you ca n't play . " <p> " Huh ? " He ran his fingers up and down the wood pieces , humming . He was playing a sea chantey CD at home these days . " ' Way haul away , we 'll haul away home  --  ' " <p> " But you ruined your puzzle . " <p> " We can go now . " <p> Taking her son 's backpack and his hand , Nina ushered him to the door . Bob currently loved the cheap battery-operated keyboard she had found at a discount store . He did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes she caught him fingering the same notes over and over with a thoughtful expression on his face . She would have to find a way to pay for piano lessons when he was older . Never squelch potential talent , Ginny always said . <p> As they pulled the door open , an aide handed Nina a paper bag full of dirty pants . " He had two accidents today , " she remarked , carefully noncommittal . Nina took the bag . Bob looked up at her with a worried expression . " Mommy , do n't break my heart , " he said , watching her face . She smiled and patted his hot cheek , hustling him outside , chastising herself for her impatience . <p> On the way to the parking lot , she ran into an old friend she had n't seen for ages . <p> " Well , look at you , " Diana said . <p> Nina hugged her , remembering how much Diana favored flowery perfumes . " When I told you I was pregnant , you never said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scared , " Diana said . " I 'd already had two miscarriages and began to think I 'd never have a child . Her name 's Cori . " They stopped to watch Diana 's curly-haired daughter gather up her backpack . <p> " So you settled down , " Nina said . <p> Her old friend waved a set of flashy rings . " He just would n't let me alone . Good thing . He teaches chemistry at the community college . " <p> " You always said you 'd never marry . " <p> Diana corralled her daughter and nudged her toward a red minivan . " Yeah , surprise ! I turned out normal . How about you ? " <p> " No surprise . I did n't . " <p> Diana tilted her head . " So what if you never go about things the way other people do . You 're exceptional . Not abnormal . " <p> " I decided to get everything out of the way at once , be a single mother , go to school , work like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to a long commitment to some quiet loony-bin spa by the time I 'm thirty . " <p> " I got ta scoot . " Diana started the battle to get her daughter strapped in . " Let 's gossip soon . " <p> " You back at work ? " <p> " Part-time until the little gal 's ready to launch . Two more years . I could n't find full-time child care I can trust that would have her . " Diana latched the seat belt across her daughter 's car seat with a sigh . <p> " It 's like getting them into a good college , applications , interviews . " <p> " And then they reject you or your child , or your private financial status . " Diana shrugged , slamming the door against her cranky child . " I discovered passable child care involved dark rooms with peed-upon plastic mattresses , watery peanut butter , and drunken college students . I realized , hey , I can do that and pay nothing . " <p> How nice for her , Nina thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home with her daughter . How might that feel ? No doubt good , no doubt fortunate . <p> " Take care , " Nina said , strapping Bob into his own car seat . He had a new book to study , so he let the process happen peacefully for a change . Suddenly starving , she climbed inside her car , rustling around in the MG 's glove compartment for a snack . She found nothing to eat there , only an old brochure for a restaurant she could never afford . Disgruntled , she raised her head to another unwelcome vision . <p> Richard Filsen leaned against the brick wall of the church that bordered the parking lot , smoking a cigarette . <p> Copyright 2008 by Pamela O'Shaughnessy and Mary O'Shaughnessy <br> Continues ...
