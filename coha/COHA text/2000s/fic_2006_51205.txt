In recent years , most of Mr. Garcia 's contributions to our pages have been fantasy stories , including the Markovy adventures . A novel entitled Firebird , related to the story of the same name , has just been published . With this new tale , Mr. Garcia shifts gears to give us a science fiction story with a cinematic feel to it . <p> SCARECROW AMY STARED OUT HER bedroom window as the summer sun settled into the flat cornfields , spreading gold fire over the green sea of leaves . Her red hair caught the slanting light , giving her a fiery orange halo . Alert brown eyes searched for the first evening star . Amy ached to make a wish . Tonight she was twelve for the last time . Tomorrow was her birthday , and tomorrow evening would be her wedding night . Leaning farther out the second floor window , straining to see a star , Amy rehearsed her wish . She wanted to be eleven again , or even ten , with her wedding day years away . Amy was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger three times her age - if she was lucky . What a ghastly thought . She would much rather shovel manure with a spoon . But no one gave her that choice . Fat chance . Everyone acted like marrying some strange man was totally natural . No one saw it her way , not Mom , not Lilith , not Delilah , or Dot . Tuck and Nathan were boys , and naturally no help . And Dad had two teenage brides himself - one of them from Amy 's grade . So she appealed to the evening star , since no one else would listen . There it was , a glowing speck , low in the north , just over the shoulder of the scarecrow at the edge of the cornfield . A real star for sure , too far from the sun to be Venus . From the house , the fence line ran due north , and the star was right where Polaris would be , but lower , and brighter . She made her wish at once , " Star light , star bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedded blight . I wish I may , I wish I might , be nine again tonight . " As if in answer , the star shone brighter , becoming plainly visible , instead of just a speck . Astounding , since there was no star that bright to the north . That had to mean her wish was granted , that somehow she would be set free . Then the star fell from the sky . Trailing fire , but still blazing brightly , her star went straight down , disappearing below the northern horizon . What in heaven ( or out of it ) was that ? Nothing that she ever saw before , that 's for sure . Maybe she was fated to wed . Not having the heart to search out a second star , Amy lay back down on the bed , though it was not yet dark . Tonight was her last night alone , in her own bed , in her own home , so she might as well make the best of it . Breakfast came all too soon , and Amy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rousing chorus of " Happy Birthday , " followed by a party , complete with cake and presents . Clothes from her mom and step-moms . Dot gave her a flower , and the boys had whittled her a whistle . Dad gave her his best leather traveling bag . Amy did her best to be sociable , sitting down and thanking everyone for the presents , though she had small appetite for cake . Mother suggested that she try to enjoy herself , saying , " We wo n't be together again for a long while . " No lie . Amy replied , " I do not want to be thirteen . " That was a mere statement of fact , but Mom took it as childish rebellion . " We can not help growing up . I am much older than I would like to be . " Only blonde Lilith tried to comfort her , smiling hopefully and pressing her bare foot against Amy 's under the table . Being youngest wife , Lilith could do little else . They were friends , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing says family like doing your step-mom 's homework . " You are at the age of consent , " Mother reminded her , as if Amy could have possibly forgotten . Dad added practically , " If we do not take you to Concordia to register , then the Bushwhackers will . " At least with Bushwhackers she had half a chance . Being older than all three of his wives combined , Dad took the long view , letting his women handle family issues . Yet he was always attentive and affectionate , being very fond of young girls , treating Amy a lot like a favorite grandchild . And he never laid a hand on her , preferring to correct with a belt . " What is the use of consenting , if I do not want to ? " Amy asked stubbornly . " Consent just means it is up to you , " her father intoned . Mother added , " No one is making you marry . " Delilah smiled wickedly across the table . " There is always the maiden 's academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , the Concordia Academy for Reluctant Virgins made marriage seem a blessing . Delilah had married Dad at thirteen , and thought this was fussing over nothing . With a young daughter , and Lilith as a live-in babysitter , Delilah enjoyed herself immensely . Last night had been her night , and Delilah once told her stepdaughter , " He looks old , but your Dad 's real active with the light out . " Just what every daughter wants to hear . Amy sat in glum silence , wishing a tornado would tear the whole house away . " Maybe no one will want you , " Tuck suggested . " I would n't . " Nathan agreed , " Me neither . " Small chance of that . Some girls were sent home , but not many . Lilith failed both fifth and sixth grade , but had no trouble getting married . Amy knew just by looking in the water pail that someone would want her , young as she was , and without her having to show a lick of sense , or even say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalked upstairs to pack . Delilah 's daughter Dot toddled after her , asking , " Are yew goin ' , Aunti Em ? " Dot could not say Amy , always calling her Aunti Em . It was too hard to explain to a toddler that she was not her aunt , but her half-sister . All she said was , " Yeah , Aunti Em is going . " " Me miss yew . " Dot plainly meant it . " Me too . " She would miss not just Dot and the family , but her whole life , which would very soon cease to be her own . Glancing out the window , she saw the road stretching north past the cornfield , past the scarecrow , disappearing into the morning haze . She heard the boys bringing out the horses to hitch to the wagon . Concordia was a long ride off , and they would need to start before noon . Dot clung to her , saying , " No want you go ! " Squatting down , Amy got on a level with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " For one wild moment , she thought she should take Dot with her , though she had no idea where she was going . But wherever it was it had to be better than here . And Dot was her true sister , the only other female born into the family . But Dot was also Delilah 's daughter , for better or for worse . " Yew will come back ? " Dot demanded . " Yeah , " she gave her little sister a hug . " I will come back for you . " Dot had a good ten years before she turned thirteen ; maybe then Amy could come for her . " Now go find your Mom . " " Bye-bye , Aunti Em . " Dot scooted off , thinking it was a game . Amy wished it was . Stuffing everything she could take into a knapsack , she left her Dad 's leather bag sitting open on the carpet . Then she swung out the window and shinned down the drainpipe , something she had done hundreds of times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pack . Except for chickens scratching about , the yard below was empty . She ducked into the smokehouse and came out with some hard sausage . As she filled her waterbag from the well , Amy took a last look at the house , which was tall and square , with big windows that made it look like a giant dollhouse . Two trees gave the only bit of shade for more than a mile around . When her bag was full , she cut across the chicken yard and went over the back fence , disappearing into the corn . Moving easily through the tangled green maze , she followed the big hand-plowed furrows to the corner where the road heading east to Aurora crossed the one that ran by their farm . This was where the scarecrow stood , wearing Nathan 's shirt and jacket , cast-off overalls , and a ragged straw hat . Pulling the shirt and overalls over her underwear , she tucked the jacket into her pack strap and put her hair up under the hat . From a decent distance she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for her . There was no room for her dress , so she buried her face in the fabric , smelling her mother 's scent , from when they hugged around the cake . Then she stuffed it deep between the cornrows and headed on her way . TIN MAN BROUGHT UP in a very deserted part of Cloud County , with Aurora far to the east and nothing to the west but the county line , Amy had no notion where she should head . Or what the wider world was like . Geography was not one of the three Rs - Reading , Rhythm , and Regulations . But she was determined to follow her star , heading due north , even if it took her into Republic County . Her biggest fear was Bushwhackers , and it was far too soon for them to be searching for her . When her family did not show in Concordia , people would want to know why - but it would be a day at least before she was posted as a runaway bride . Aiming to make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarecrow clothes , not looking back . Wagons went by . Then cheerful families on buggies , but Amy turned down every offer of a ride . In theory she had done no wrong , and had until dusk to register as a bride , but she did not want helpful strangers whisking her into Concordia . After ten or so miles , she had to make her first detour , swinging west through the fields to avoid Jamestown , and the road to Concordia . Now she was clearly on the run , with nothing ahead of her but the county line . Grasshoppers bounded about in the heat , soaring away down the road , waiting for her to catch up , then flying off again . Dust appeared ahead , a small thin cloud that might have been a whirlwind , since it was certainly tornado weather . She watched the dust devil come closer , not feeling especially wary , until the cloud topped a rise . There was a Wheeler beneath it , headed straight at her . Damn ! Only the second Wheeler she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Wheelers lived far to the west , beyond Norton and Oberlin . They were scary fast , and would turn her in as easy as Bushwhackers . Both were always looking out for girls on the run . Leaving the road would just attract attention . Amy pulled her hat down over face and kept on walking , sure he could not he looking for her . Rapidly , the Wheeler got closer , becoming a man in a scarlet suit and black boots , seated atop a silver frame , with two spoked wheels that seemed to turn on their own , whirling along without a horse or peddles , trailing a tall cloud of dust . Grabbing her straw hat to help cover her face , Amy waved vigorously as the Wheeler sped past . That was what a boy would do . He was wearing goggles and a red cap , and guiding the front wheel with silver handlebars , so long and curved that he could lean back in his seat , steering in complete comfort . Fast as he had come , the Wheeler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dust settled , and Amy quickened her pace , determined not to be surprised so easily next time . Now she kept looking over her shoulder , and half a mile farther along she spotted another cloud of dust - this time to the south . Another Wheeler . Two in one day . Or the same one coming back to have a closer look . Amy ducked into the corn , threading through the green rows until she could not be seen from the road . Sure enough , this time the Wheeler seemed to slow , and maybe even stop , as though searching for her . But there was nothing to see , and the dust cloud went whirling off to the north . She no longer felt safe on the road , a feeling soon reinforced by yet another passing Wheeler , this one headed south . Or maybe it was the same one , still looking for her . Heading north through the corn rows , she slid between the stalks , letting the furrows guide her feet . Dodging the Wheelers was no fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star gave her direction . Which was good , since she knew what she was running from , but not where she was going . Without warning , Amy came upon a dish-like depression twenty yards across . There the corn was crushed down , with the flattened stalks radiating outward from the center , where a smaller deeper ring was gouged into the ground . For the first time since leaving the road , Amy saw open sky . It scared her . Something with a big saucer-shaped bottom had fallen out of that sky , crushed the corn , then gone on its way . A distant dust plume signaled another Wheeler on the road . Skirting the depression , Amy sought safety in the narrow green tunnels , sliding between the tall stalks . Crows cawed at the walking scarecrow , but no one else noticed . She soon came on another saucer-like depression , which she also avoided . But beyond that her way was suddenly blocked by a long break in the corn , stretching straight across her path . What to do now ? All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something had whipped through the rows , inches above the ground . Nothing like this ever happened back on the farm . Amy tried to go around the break . She ran right into a great silver wing , slanting into the ground . This stiff silver wing had cut through the corn like a scythe , slicing out a wide clearing . Attached to it was the crushed and burnt fuselage of a sailplane . Forgetting her fear , Amy crept closer . She had seen sailplanes gliding overhead , but never this close up , near enough to touch , if she dared . Wedged inside the crumpled cockpit was the biggest monkey Amy had ever seen . Bigger than her , and dead , with his dried blood spattered over the the smashed controls . Sheesh ! Awfully gory , even to Amy , who gutted pigs and beheaded chickens at home - pigs she considered her friends , and hens she had raised from chicks . Amy backed away slowly , until she was standing smack up against the corn . She hoped that up past Concordia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Wheelers , then this mashed flying monkey . What next ? As if in answer , she heard someone crashing toward her . Horses were coming , many horses , thrashing through the corn . The only folks who casually rode over a farmer 's standing corn , with no care or warning , were Bushwhackers . Amy spun about and vanished into the corn , having little faith in her scarecrow disguise . If Bushwhackers did not like how she looked , they would sling her over a saddle and take her into Concordia just to be sure . Hooting and hollering the whole way . Who needed that ? Not her . She followed the furrows away from the wreck , working her way downwind , in case they had dogs . When she found a safe spot beneath the corn , she squatted and listened for pursuit , unsure what to do next . Following her star had gotten her in more trouble than Amy could have ever imagined . Bushwhackers should not even be looking for her , but here they were , so close she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a soft voice behind her hissed , " Hey , kid . " Amy almost leaped out of her scarecrow pants , spinning swiftly about . Behind her , crouched in the corn , was a dark-haired , smiling girl in a blue-checked gingham dress , wearing pigtails and bright ruby-red slippers . She waved to Amy , saying , " Come here . " Surprised at being called kid by someone smaller than she was , Amy crawled back through the corn to where the girl in the gingham dress was hiding . Looking Amy over keenly , the little girl asked , " Who are you ? " " Tip . " The first male name that came to mind ; it belonged to one of their dogs . " If you say so . " The little girl produced a small clear capsule from her dress pocket , holding it up to Amy 's mouth . " Here , spit in this . " Amy looked at her like she was crazy . " Go on , spit , " the girl insisted . " It wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is that for ? " " DNA sample . " The girl carefully closed the capsule , held it up to the light , then tucked it into her checked dress , adding , " We had better get going . " " Going where ? " " Away from here . " The girl nodded toward the crash site . " That sailplane was a two-seater , and there is only one body . Even Bushwhackers can count that far . " Amy had not thought of that . She asked , " What was that in the wreck ? " " SuperChimp named Ham . He was my pilot . " " Your pilot ? " " Damned good one too , named for the first ape in space . " Getting up , the girl smoothed out her dress , saying , " Come on , before Bushwhackers come looking . " They set out , sliding in silence for most of an hour through green tunnels of corn . With no more obstructions or weird depressions , the cornfields went on until they came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink and rest their hot feet in cool rippling water . Amy asked , " What 's your name ? " " Dorothy , " the girl in gingham replied . " Means Beloved of God , " Amy observed piously . Dorothy nodded . " One of the reasons I picked it . " " You do n't come from around here , do you ? " Amy guessed . Girls she knew did not pick their names . " Heavens , no . " Dorothy smiled at the notion . " I fell out of the sky . Last night , actually . Have n't been here a day . " Amy believed it . Dorothy did not act or talk like a little girl , but Amy did not press the subject , since she was pretending to be a boy . " Fell from where ? " " Kansas system . " Amy had never heard of it . " What county is that ? " Dorothy smiled at her naivete . " Kansas is a G-type star , not far from here . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fairy tales . " What are you doing here ? " " Right now , trying to get home , " Dorothy explained airily . " Got anything to eat ? " Amy opened her pack and produced a piece of cake . Dorothy 's sly smile broke into a grin . " Birthday cake ? " " There 's also some hard sausage . " " Cake 's fine . " Dorothy broke off a bit of frosted corner and stuffed it in her mouth . " So , how old are you today ? " " Thirteen , " Amy admitted . " Sorry to hear that . " " Me too . " Amy forgot she was supposed to be a boy . " So did you run off ? " Amy nodded guiltily . " Do you blame me ? " " Heavens no ! " Dorothy hurried to console her . " Barefoot and pregnant is no way to start junior high . " Dorothy broke off more cake . " Is " Tip " a product of whimsical parents , or part of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am on the run , but I do n't know to where . Last night , I tried to wish upon the first star , and it fell from the sky , trailing fire . I 've been following it ever since . " " That was me , " Dorothy declared , happily splashing her feet in the stream . " Couple of saucers got us . " " Saucers ? " " UFOs , " Dorothy explained . " Those moving lights you see at night . " " Dad says that 's swamp gas . " Dorothy rolled her eyes . " See any swamps on your way here ? " She had n't . Just lots of corn , and summer wheat . " Saucers are scary smart , " Dorothy warned , " and can see for miles . UFOs are why I was lying low , until those Bushwhackers arrived . " Amy told Dorothy about her own adventures since leaving home , dodging Wheelers , then Bushwhackers . Dorothy was impressed . " You saw my ship shot down , and came straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Amy was not so sure . " I thought it was a star . " " Still , you got here , and that 's what counts . " They headed off downstream , walking in the water to confuse their scent , in case the Bushwhackers brought dogs - which they did when they had difficult girls to track . Bushwhackers kept in practice by hunting coons in the dark . This little stream led them to the Republican River , which ran down from Republican County and the Pawnee Nation . They camped on the south bank of the Republican , making a fire , and staring up at the stars , while chewing hard sausage . Amy smirked , saying , " This was going to be my wedding night . " " Disappointed ? " Dorothy asked . " Not at all . " Thirteen and unmarried . Only that morning Amy thought it was impossible , now it felt wonderful . With nowhere to go , this warm campfire seemed the perfect place to be . " Where is Kansas , the star you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Earth . " Dorothy searched the sky , then pointed , saying , " That dim one , there . " " I see it . " Amy knew the night sky by heart . " Kansas is the name of the star . It has two terraformed planets , Wichita and Topeka - but I 'm not from either of them . I was born aboard ship . " " So , how old are you ? " Amy asked suspiciously . " In Earth years ? " Dorothy smirked . " Way older than you . " Small surprise , Dorothy acted much older than anyone Amy knew , except maybe Dad . " But you look like a kid . " " I 'm a Munchkin . " Dorothy acted nonchalant . " We are bio-engineered not to mature , or even go through puberty . " " Why ? " That was the strangest thing Amy had heard since leaving home , weirder than flying monkeys . " Because some folks thought it would be fun . " Dorothy sounded breezy , but still a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy genetechs . I was rescued from a slaver harem when I was four . " " Slavers ? " One of those words Amy had heard whispered by adults , when she was not supposed to be listening . " Like Bushwhackers , only worse . " " So how old are you ? " Sitting in the flickering firelight , Dorothy looked nine or ten , at most . " Thirty-two standard years , not counting relativity effects . I have lived half my life at light speed . " " So you have no family ? " " Conceived in a lab , and born in an incubator . My earliest memories are of living in a creche , with a bunch of other babies for sale , aboard the slaver Hydra . But I have a perfectly fine foster family on Topeka . They 're the folks who raised me . " And Amy thought her life was weird . Next morning they were up with the birds , breakfasting on the last of her birthday cake . As Amy fed crumbs to the sparrows , Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican up into the next county . Once we get past Kackley there are no towns to worry about until we get to the pickup point just beyond Jewel City . Ham was supposed to drop me off , then fly me to safety - but in case something bad happened , there are other arrangements . " Something bad had happened , especially to Ham , spattered all over his cockpit . Now it was just assumed that they were both going to this " pickup . " If Amy had another choice she might well have taken it . Dorothy sensed her fear . " Just remember , west of Jewel City , tomorrow night , near to dawn . Get there , and we are both okay . What you do n't know , Bushwhackers ca n't beat out of you . " A happy thought . Like parents and teachers , Bushwhackers had the authority to thrash the truth out of flagrant liars , or errant runaways . Amy was both . Heading upriver , they crossed over into Republic County , named for the Pawnee Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her in , but late summer was when they had their virgin cornsacrifice to the Morning Star . Not the best time to go knocking on Pawnee long lodges . Eventually they came to a bridge , and a road crossing it , paved with yellow bricks . Each brick was stamped GOLDEN BRICK COMPANY , JEWEL CITY . They set out down the yellow brick road , talking and laughing . Only to find Kackley full of Wheelers , some headed south into Cloud County , most just speeding around town , kicking up dust . Not a pretty sight . This meant another miles-long detour through the fields , consuming most of the morning . Twice , Dorothy begged food and DNA samples from farm families . When they got back to the yellow brick road , it was afternoon already , with many long miles to go . At the county line , the road jogged to the south , for a while forming the border ; then it turned decisively into Jewel County . Almost at once , their luck changed . They came upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , bearing the company motto on his chest , " We Lay Good and Gold Brick . " On his shiny back it said , " Golden Brick Company , Jewel City and County . " " Just what we need , " Dorothy decided , producing an electronic bug , shaped like a spider . Amy watched in amazement as the bug scurried across the gold bricks , then raced up the robot 's tin-plated leg and body . As soon as the spider clamped itself to the robot 's head , the brick layer froze in midmotion . " These repair robots do n't have much of a brain , " Dorothy expained . " Hop aboard . He will do whatever we want . " Dorothy had the robot dump his bricks and pick them up instead . " So long as that bug stays attached , the robot will obey both you and me . Try it out . " Amy told the mechanical man to head west , and he did , carrying them easily over the yellow bricks . This was the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulder , able to see all around , with her feet resting in his metal hand . Though the robot could not outrun the Wheelers , they could easily spot them coming . Amy asked , " What if Wheelers are waiting for us at Jewel City ? " " Wheelers are at their worst at night . " Dorothy had no fear in the dark , being able to gather firewood and count stars long after Amy gave up . They ran into trouble well before dusk . As the sun dipped into the southwest , a silver disk separated from the corona and started sweeping the sky between them and fewel City . Dorothy ordered the robot off the road , headed north fast and hard , saying , " That UFO is hunting us . It came right out of the sun to sweep the road . We dare not approach until dark . " Not content just to hide , Dorothy told the mechanical man to keep going north toward Webber , up by the Pawnee Nation . " Those disks see a long way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed it . Bushwhackers had been on to her faster than she ever thought possible . As the sun set behind them , they kept on going , crossing the White Rock fork of the Republican , and skirting Webber in the dark . Amy worried aloud , saying , " There are nothing but Pawnee up here . " " That 's why we are going through in the dark , " Dorothy explained . " It 's virgin sacrifice season . " " Do n't have to tell me , " Amy whispered back . The Pawnee habit of sacrificing stray virgins to the Morning Star was the only drawback of an otherwise friendly and hospitable people . " What 's beyond the Pawnee ? " This was a question Amy had never thought to ask before . Pawnee to the north , Cheyenne to the west , and Ottawas to the south , those were the limits of her world - heard of , but hardly ever seen . All Dorothy said was , " You 'll see . " And Amy did . Without much warning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ottawas turned into sandy desert , followed by fenced wheatfields shining in the moonlight , backed by stands of corn . She had thought that heyond the Pawnee there could only be more Indians . Instead it looked like home . " Where are we ? " " This is Mitchell County . We are still headed north , aiming to cross the Solomon , west of Beloit . " Amy could tell they were headed north , aimed smack at the Little Dipper , but the rest made no sense . Mitchell County was south of Jewel City . Beloit was just about even with her home , only one county over . " How could we get here by heading north ? " Dorothy sighed . " Here 's where it gets hard . You 're not living on Earth . Not even close . " " Not Earth ? " Where else could she be ? " Brace yourself , " Dorothy advised . " Your world is not even a planet , it 's a habitat , a spinning torus about a hundred miles across , orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of gravity control and 3V effects . North just means moving around the inner surface of the torus counter-clockwise . " Amy stared at Dorothy in disbelief , but the little girl in gingham just said , " Get used to it . Every world is finite . Yours is just smaller than most , and turned in on itself , like an overgrown doughnut . North is counterclockwise , south is clockwise , east is spin ward , and west is anti-spinward . If you go straight in any direction , you will come back to where you started . " Apparently . Amy still could not believe it . " Same is true in the big universe outside , " Dorothy told her , " discounting relativity effects . Ottawas and Pawnee have known this for a long time , but settled folk tend to hide it from the kids . " Proof of this outrageous claim came when they crossed the Solomon west of Beloit , and Amy recognized the big covered bridge , having been there before . Soon they were back in Jewel County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just to the north of them was the yellow brick road that they had left many miles to the south . Dorothy weighed their chances of making the rendezvous . " This is the area they searched yesterday afternoon . They found nothing , so it should be safe to enter , especially from the south . I 've programmed the pickup point into this robot , so whatever happens , try to stay with him . " With nowhere else to go , Amy nodded vigorously . Supported by the swift , strong metal man , she felt invulnerable . From what Dorothy said , there was a huge wide cosmos beyond the narrow limits of her world . This was her best chance of getting there . If she did not go with Dorothy , she might as well give herself to the Bushwhackers . Before they even got to the yellow brick road , Amy saw lights blinking to the east , between them and Jewel City . Dorothy told the metal man to put them down , saying , " We should go on foot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about him ? " Amy had grown fond of the robot . Dorothy smiled at her concern , saying , " I 'm leaving the bug on him , just in case . Hopefully we 're home free . " " Home " and " free " were two words Amy never put together , but Dorothy was full of such odd sayings . As they approached the road , Dorothy whispered for silence . " Pickup is now , two hundred meters north of the road . If you lose me , just keep heading for the Little Dipper . " Amy nodded . Follow the Drinking Gourd . Holding onto Dorothy 's hand , she crept up to the road . Dawn glowed faintly in the east , beyond the lights of Jewel City , but by now the moon had set , leaving only starlight to the north . Amy did not see the road until she stumbled hard on an invisible brick . " Shit ! " Dorothy hissed . " We 've been seen . " By whom ? Amy peered about , nursing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the road , saying , " Run . " Run where ? Suddenly , stabbing bright lights flashed in her eyes , blinding her even more . Unable to see , she fell to her knees , holding her hat . Dorothy stepped between her and the glaring lights , a small dark blur . Wheels whined in the dark , and the lights leaped forward , flashing down the road toward Dorothy . Amy wanted to scream , but did not dare , as the lights sped past and Dorothy disappeared . Blinded again , Amy stared into darkness , still on her knees , listening for Wheelers . Nothing . Amy could not hear any Wheelers , or see the lights of Jewel City . She wanted to call out to Dorothy , but it would do no good . Suddenly , strong hands seized her , lifting her up . She struggled against the merciless grip , expecting to hear a triumphant Bushwhacker yell . But the hands holding her were cold tin-plated metal . It was the robot , and he began to run with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . COWARDLY LION DAWN FOUND AMY sitting in a cold wheatfield , miserable and alone , with the silent robot at her side . Tall fluffy clouds dotted the bright 3V sky . Pickup , whatever that meant , had not happened . Instead she had lost Dorothy , the best friend she ever had . Practically her only friend . Sure Dorothy was weird , but no weirder than tutoring her seventh-grade stepmom , or having Dot call her " Aunti Em . " Given her family , anyone Amy got to know was sure to be strange . Despite Dorothy 's genetic deformity , the Munchkin was the bravest , smartest person Amy had ever known . The only one to say , " Look girl , this is totally nuts . We 're getting you out of here . " Now she was going nowhere . Whoever was coming for Dorothy , did not come for her - leaving Amy with no notion what to do next . Her big , shining , tin-plated robot was strong , fast , tireless , and obedient , but unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man got answers like : PLEASE REPHRASE QUESTION Or maybe : SPECIFY POINT-SECOND And repeatedly : VOID DATA FIELD If he only had a brain . Taking a drink from her waterbag , Amy noted it would need to be filled . Not so easy this far from the Solomon , where creeks were few and dry . Deciding to pee , she got up and walked around behind the metal man , going a good ways into the wheat . Sure , he was just a machine that saw and talked , but it made her feel better . Pulling down her scarecrow pants , she squatted in the wheat , wondering what to do next . Nothing came to mind . As Amy finished , and pulled up her pants , she was blindsided by a tawny blur that shot out of the wheat stalks , knocking her off her feet . Clawed hands seized her , one covering her mouth , the other pressing her into the wheat . Something heavy and hairy had landed on top of her , holding her down and hissing in her ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give us away . " Us ? What did this beast mean ? Though it had hands and fingers , the thing holding her most resembled a man-sized panther , with tan fur and a slight lisp . He whispered , " Promise not to scream , and I will take my hand away . " She nodded vigorously , and his hand relaxed . Amy breathed out , then turned to look at her attacker . Seeing a tawny , yellow-eyed cat face , with white saber-like canines inches from her throat , Amy shrieked . His hand cut off her cry . " You promised , " he hissed . " Screaming will just bring Bushwhackers . " Neither of them wanted that . Amy nodded again , and he relaxed his grip . She asked , " Who are you ? " " Call me Leo , " the big cat suggested , " a lot of humans do . " " What are you ? " " Never seen a SuperCat ? " Leo sounded sorry for her . " We 're a genetic improvement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , created centuries back from human and big cat DNA , to tackle superhuman tasks . " So far , all Leo had tackled was her , but he was rigged for trouble , wearing battle-armor , and a string of gas grenades that dug into Amy 's side . She was also getting her first close-up look at the butt of a militarystyle stinger , tucked into the SuperCat 's furry armpit . Leo 's sly sabertoothed smile widened . " My current task is simple . Have you seen a small dark-haired female in a blue dress ? I fear she is in distress . " " Maybe . " Leo was no Bushwhacker . Or Wheeler . This heavily armed , gene-spliced catman fairly screamed " off-world . " Animals in Cloud County usually knew their place . Only parrots talked , and even the worst chicken-thief coyotes stole about unarmed . " My orders are to rescue her , " Leo explained . " She is Peace Corps , assigned to this world . " Peace Corps . Another word adults only whispered . Besides runaway girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were the worst sort of Jayhawkers , fiends that came in the night to steal naughty girls like Amy . What they did with them , heaven only knew . Dorothy hardly fit the image . Smiling slyly , the SuperCat cocked an eye at her . " Tell me you never heard of the Peace Corps ? " " I have heard of them . " She just did not know who they were . " Good . " Leo got up , setting Amy hack on her feet . " ' Cause they are the only folks within a bullion light-years who give a hoot about your naked-monkey ass . So you need to help me . " Amy finished pulling up her pants , telling her attacker , " You did n't have to jump me while I was peeing . " Leo laughed , standing up on his hind legs . " second best time to hit an awake human . I did n't want to tackle your robot too . That was the only time you parted from him . " " Right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to know that he feared the robot , which was programmed to defend humans from animal attack . Her captor patted chaff off her pants , asking , " So have you seen Dorothy ? " " Wheelers took her . " Amy pointed back toward the yellow brick road . " Heading west . " " Probably taking her back to Wheeler , " Leo decided . " What will happen to her ? " By now she was horribly worried for Dorothy . Wheeler sounded worse than the Concordia Academy for Reluctant Virgins . Furry shoulders shrugged . " Do I look like a Wheeler ? " Not a lot . " So what will you do ? " " Report that she did not make pickup . " Leo was beginning to sound like the robot . Amy scooped up her hat , saying , " I 'm going to find her . " " In Wheeler ? " Leo laughed aloud . Wherever . Two days away from home , with nothing but her scarecrow clothes , and a next to useless robot , Amy knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her whole life turned on that wish-upon-a-star . Going back now would be as good as suicide . " This is nonsense , " Leo declared , as she stalked over to the tin man , telling him to pick her up . The robot hoisted her onto its shoulder . " What will you do for me ? " Amy asked . " If I give up on Dorothy , what do I get ? " Leo shrugged again . " Nothing . " Exactly . Leo meant to abandon her , as soon as she ceased to be useful . Dorothy deserved better than that . Amy told the robot to take her to the yellow brick road , and head west . Rolling his eyes , Leo trotted after her , saying , " You 're going the wrong way . " Amy shot back . " Why do you care ? " " I do n't , " Leo assured her . " But I can not allow you to get caught . You know too much . " Of course . So long as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen Leo , and the SuperCat could not afford to let Bushwhackers beat the truth out of her - then come looking for him . Hardly caring about humans , Leo was very careful with his own furry skin . Leo told her , " Wheelers have to use the yellow brick road , going west to Wheeler . That 's the long way around the torus . We can go the short way , through the Kickapoos to Cheyenne country , getting to Wheeler before they arrive . " Head the wrong way and get there first . Why was she the only one who thought that sounded wrong ? " And you 're coming with me ? " " Reluctantly , " Leo admitted . He could not coerce her so long as she sat atop her tin-plated protector . So they turned about , heading for Kickapoo Country , bypassing Jewel City , Kackley , Norway , and Agenda . When the yellow brick road ended , Leo led her through the badlands in broad daylight , without so much as seeing a Kickapoo . Leo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin man let Amy keep up . In a few hours they had come back around , and were in Cheyenne County , crossing the south fork of the Republican , which should have been miles behind them . On the far bank , Amy saw the yellow brick road rising out of the stream . She had found the west end of the road by heading east , making her world very much smaller than she ever imagined . Leo led her past Wheeler , to a lonely stretch of the yellow brick road west of Bird City , so close Amy glimpsed the half-mile tall aviary tower . She would have liked to get a closer look , but feared being spotted by Birdmen , who were little better than flying Bushwhackers . By now she was a posted runaway bride , with a generous reward for her capture , payable in Concordia . At a shady spot out of sight of the tower , she and Leo settled down to watch the road . Curious about the wider universe , Amy asked the SuperCat , " Where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far away , " Leo replied airily . " Why ? " " Excellent question , especially when I am about to take on a pack of Wheelers , aided by a scarecrow in drag . " Leo clearly did not like their chances , and resented her putting him here . " This is what I do . Every so often , the Peace Corps must be backed by the sure and precise use of force . Something humans are pretty horrible at . " Hard to argue there . All the force in Cloud County , from Bushwhackers to just plain folks , were aimed at making her life hell - for no good reason that Amy could see . This deep in Cheyenne County , there was scant traffic on the yellow brick road , so when a dust cloud appeared , Amy knew it would be Wheelers . Leo looked intently down the road , finally saying , " She 's with them . " " How can you tell ? " All Amy could see was dots beneath the dust cloud . Leo tapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see her yellow bows . " No wonder Dorothy could find her way in the dark . Amy held her breath , watching the dust cloud get bigger . Looking away for a moment , she saw that Leo had vanished , along with the robot . Just like the cowardly lion to leave her all alone . By now the Wheelers were near enough for her to see Dorothy , strapped in a side-car . As the Wheelers drew abreast of her , gas grenades went off along the yellow brick road . Sleep gas billowed up on both sides of the Wheelers , who lost control , skidding and crashing into one another . Dorothy 's side-car kept her motorcycle stable , and it came roaring out of the white gas cloud , with Dorothy asleep , and the tin man at the controls . Very neatly done . Leo rose out of the long grass , never having gotten near the wrecked Wheelers . The robot brought the cycle to a stop in front of Amy , with Dorothy still slumped in the side-car . Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped open , and the girl in blue gingham stared up at the 3V sky , asking , " Where am I ? " Amy knelt down to take her hand . " Just west of Bird City , on the way to Wheeler . " That shocked Dorothy . " What the hell am I doing here ? " " It will take too long to tell , " Leo objected . " We 've missed pickup , and must make for Mount Sunflower . " Dorothy grimmaced . " That bad ? " " Worse , " the SuperCat assured her , helping Dorothy mount the robot . Amy climbed up onto the other shoulder , and they headed for Mount Sunflower , leaving unconscious Wheelers littering the yellow brick road . South of Wheeler , rolling plains rose toward mile-high Mount Sunflower . They crossed the Little Beaver and the North Fork of the Smoky Hill , seeing nothing but Cheyenne lodges and clumps of buffalo . Ominous lightning strikes to the north were followed by distant rolling thunder , on an otherwise sunny day . Clearly tornado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them . " UFO to the north . " Leo glumly agreed , but it was twenty minutes before Amy made out a blue-white spark near the northern horizon , backed by tall spiked clouds and a darkening sky . Feeling the breeze stirring , and pressure dropping , Amy warned , " There 's a tornado coming . " " Do tell ? " Leo had come to the same conclusion . Amy asked Dorothy , " What happens when we get to Mount Sunflower ? " Her Munchkin friend smiled , saying , " The summit has an emergency exit to the habitat - where no one would likely stumble on it . " Despite all Amy had seen , it was amazing to think that her world was so tiny that it had hidden exits into the real cosmos . As the land rose toward Mount Sunflower , rain fell , just a sprinkling at first , followed by hail - stinging pea-sized balls of ice - that grew to frosty marbles , battering at Amy 's scarecrow hat . Wind kicked up , whipping the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunflower circling in a familiar pattern . Holding hard to her hat , she fought the mounting suction . Hail turned to horizontal rain , lashing at their faces , then suddenly ceasing as they entered the eye of the cyclone . Amy clung to the robot 's shoulder , while Dorothy ordered the tin-plated man to run faster . Looking straight up , Amy could see a funnel cloud forming directly overhead , a great gray whirlpool , spinning faster and rising higher . At the summit of Mount Sunflower , debris rained down , twigs , branches , clods of mud , roof nails and barn shingles . Howling winds tore at Amy 's hold on the robot . Her straw hat flew off . A few more seconds , and the swirling funnel of grit and pebbles would pull her fingers free , and whirl her away as well . Amy 's whole world had turned on her - Wheelers , UFOs , Birdmen , Bushwhackers , and now a twister . Leo knelt and grabbed a patch of ground , yanking it up , revealing a pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling Leo off his feet , lifting the ground up with him . Holding grimly to the latch , Leo bellowed for help , telling the robot , " Take us down , damn you . " Only the robot had the weight to resist the twister . Diving into the hole , with Amy and Dorothy clinging to his back , the tin man grabbed Leo as he fell past , hauling the SuperCat in with them . " Close the lock , " roared Leo , clawing at the lock ladder as tornado winds tried to suck them back out . " Shut it , now ! " Fighting tremendous suction , the lock mechanism struggled to obey . Then the robot threw his full weight on the hatch , dragging it closed . Howling ceased , and the wind stopped . Silence filled the small metal airlock . Amy saw they were all there , looking wet and bedraggled - Dorothy , Leo , and the tin man , covered with dirt and twigs , but safe for the moment . Her scarecrow clothes were totally soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was another hatch in the chamber floor . Dorothy showed her how to choose the right-sized suit , and how to seal it tight . Leo had more trouble suiting up than she did . Then Amy hugged the tin man , saying good-bye to the robot , who responded with a pleasant : NULL PROGRAM " I 'll remember you too , " Amy promised the metal man . Dorothy retrieved her bug , then Leo emptied the lock and threw back the bottom hatch . Amy stared down the incredibly deep shaft beneath , startled to see stars at the far end . Literally the end of the world . Cool air from the suit recycler chilled the nape of her neck . She asked Dorothy over the suit comlink , " How do we get down ? " " Easy , " Leo declared , giving her a shove . " Relax and try not to struggle . " Toppling into the shaft , Amy fell right out of the 1-g field , into a slowly accelerating descent . For the first time in her life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth shaft walls slid by , gaining speed , going faster and faster . Then the walls vanished , and she went flying out into the starry void , a tiny self-contained satellite in her vacuum suit . Glancing back , she saw the huge outer hull of the habitat , a gray , faceless wall , slowly receding from her . Dorothy and Leo appeared , two figures in silver suits , shooting out of the gray wall . Dorothy 's suit began to broadcast : MAYDAY , MAYDAY , MAYDAY ... Why May Day ? It was August . Maybe dates were different in space . Leo 's voice cut in . " Saucer port opening . " Amy saw a bright slot appear in the huge gray wall . Three flat disks emerged from the slot . " Saucers coming out , " Leo announced . " Three of them ! " MAYDAY , MAYDAY ... Amy watched the disks grow larger , heading right for them . Close up , they did look like pairs of saucers , one piled upside down atop the other . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackdaw . " Silently , a spark separated from the stars , moving closer , and growing in size , becoming a mini-starship , a nuclear-armed Navy corvette . Glancing back at the saucers , Amy saw that gaping ports had opened on the saucer bottoms . All set to scoop them up . " Hellhounds loosed ! " Leo shouted , as three smaller sparks separated from the Jackdaw . The effect on the saucers was miraculous . Instantly they closed their ports and sped away , firing off smaller decoys to confuse the missiles . Not at all fooled , the Hellhounds streaked by , going straight after the fleeing saucers . Which left the three of them floating alone in space . Amy watched the Jackdaw expand into a long cylindrical ramscoop , with an arsenal of smart-nukes , and minimal crew quarters . Operating on gravity drive , the Jackdaw swept them up into the ramscoop , where automated grapples reeled them in . Crew members helped Amy out of her suit and gave her ship 's coveralls to replace her sodden scarecrow clothes . Dorothy helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now nothing of her world remained . Viewscreens showed the world she had left behind , looking like a great gray donut , hanging amid incredibly distant stars . Hard to believe that everything she knew was wrapped up inside . She asked Dorothy , " What will happen to me . " " Hard to say . " Dorothy sympathized with her dilemma . " But you can stay with me until you make up your mind . " " With you ? " That sounded wonderful . " I have a place in Kansas system , " Dorothy explained . " Which is where we 're headed . Eventually . " Right now they were headed nowhere . Jackdaw was in close orbit around the habitat , keeping watch on her world . Amy shook her head , admitting , " I do n't understand any of this . " " Few folks do , " Dorothy agreed . " Your world is a stolen habitat stashed in a dead system . Navy intelligence thinks it 's a nest of slavers , and that 's why Jackdaw keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they asked for a Peace Corps investigation . " " That 's you ? " Apparently peace and war went hand-in-hand . " Exactly . I was supposed to take a closer look , and try to get evidence . DNA samples , that sort of thing . " " Like when I spit in that tube ? " Dorothy nodded . " You are related to five known slavers , either killed or DNA-identified - men who raided and kidnapped for profit . " And who dealt in gene-altered oddities like Dorothy . " Two cousins , a paternal uncle , and both your grandfathers . " Father always said that before he " bought the farm " he had lived offworld ; now she knew what he had been doing . And why family arguments never fazed him , so long as they were not settled with a blaster . Dorothy took her hand , a strangely parental gesture from someone a head shorter , saying , " You are living proof that this is a slaver haven , where retired slavers go to raise sons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy . " It was fairly horrific to hear your world reduced to those terms , but this all started with her running away . " What will happen now ? " " Maybe nothing . In Kansas system there are folks who say that what happens out here is not our business . " Dorothy did not think that way , having been saved from a slaver creche herself . " These are mostly retired slavers , absolutely bent on avoiding the law . Why not let them live out their golden years in peace ? Civilized worlds only act when our own interests are at stake - that 's what separates us from the barbarians . " Dorothy sounded sarcastic . Amy just stared at her world , orbiting through the void , all turned in on itself . Mom and Dad , Tuck and Nathan , Lilith , Delilah and Dot , all lived in there , along with everyone that Amy had ever known , everything she had ever seen before she turned thirteen . Hard to believe it . All Amy knew for sure was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
