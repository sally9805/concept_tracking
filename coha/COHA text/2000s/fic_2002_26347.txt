Old Town in the Green Groves Laura Ingalls Wilder 's Lost Little House Years Chapter One A Rented House It was wintertime on the prairie , and things were changing all around Laura as she walked to school each morning . The wide prairie skies were no longer softly blue and filled with the voices of bobolinks and meadowlarks and sparrows . Now gray clouds had settled low over the land , and they promised a time of snow and cold and the hungry call of blackbirds in the brown , empty fields . Laura loved the winter for its stillness and its gray-white beauty . But she also knew it could be cruel . She had lived on the prairie long enough to learn that . Laura was not so worried about what surprises winter might bring this year , for Pa had moved the whole family from their farm on Plum Creek to a snug little rented house behind the church in Walnut Grove . Walnut Grove was a newly settled town on the Minnesota prairie , and it was the safest place to be when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but shiver and shake and wait until the storm gave back the land . On Plum Creek blizzards had been hard . Pa had nearly died in one . And some neighbors had died from being lost in the snow . But in a little house in town the Ingalls family would be safer and happier . Pa would n't get lost in a blinding white storm as he drove the wagon home from town . He was already in town . Ma would n't worry so and watch the northwest sky for a low , black line of cloud . And Laura and Mary and Carrie would be more cheerful because they could go to school every day instead of staying in their lonely farmhouse all winter , restless and waiting for spring . Laura liked school , and she was happy to walk there with her sisters each day . Laura had not thought that she would like school , when she was littler . She had n't wanted to be away from the warm company of Ma all day . She had n't wanted to miss Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And most of all , she did n't want to miss Pa and his-happy blue eyes and his good cheer and his stories . But Laura liked school now . She liked it more every day . I like school , " she said to Mary and Carrie as they made their way along the crisp dirt road leading to the schoolhouse . The sky was still not quite light , and Laura held little Carrie 's hand for safety . Carrie was six years old now , but she was still the baby of the family . " I love school , " said Mary , adjusting her shawl against the chilly wind . I could live there if I did n't love home more . " Laura smiled . Mary had always been the best one at learning . Mary had always been the best at everything . She was kindest . She was the most patient . She minded Ma better . And she was n't a tomboy , like Laura was sometimes . Laura knew that she could never be as good as Mary , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good girl they could be proud of I like singing the letters , " said Carrie . " And tag . " ' Laura smiled and squeezed Carrie 's hand . Carrie was a good girl , too . When the road ended , the girls followed the narrow path leading up to the little white schoolhouse sitting alone on the prairie . Laura could see Frank Carr carrying in the water bucket for Miss Beadle and James Harris toting a load of logs for the fire . Miss Beadle had arrived early and already started up a crackling fire in the pot-bellied stove and warmed up the frosty-cold classroom . But the cold prairie wind would blow all day long , and all day long the fire would want feeding . " Good morning , Laura ! " said Rebekah when the girls stepped through the schoolhouse door and into the cloakroom to take off their wraps . " Good morning , Rebekah ! " answered Laura . Rebekah was one of Laura 's favorite friends . She always had a nice word for everybody and she loved to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraps on nails and put their tin lunch pails on the cloakroom bench , it was time to go in and say good morning to Miss Beadle . Then school would begin . Laura thought Miss Beadle was a fine teacher . She always looked so nice , in her pretty white bodice and her long black skirt and her dark hair pulled back and held with a comb . Miss Beadle always opened the school day with a prayer and a song . This morning the song was " Wait for the Wagon . " Laura smiled as she sang , " Wait for the wagon and we 'll all take a ride ! " She was thinking of Pa and how much he loved taking a wagon west . Laura loved it . too . She could go west every day , her whole life long . At the end of the school day , in a softly falling snow and a steady wind , Laura and her sisters walked back to their home in town . When they passed Oleson 's General Store , Laura could see Nellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laura imagined Nellie standing in front of one of the big store barrels , cramming her mouth full of candy until bedtime . Then Laura decided not to think about Nellie at all . She walked on toward the small church with the belfry on top . Behind the church there was home . Soon Laura and her sisters opened the front door of their little rented house and stepped inside . Ma had a pot of beans on the stove , cooking with a side of pork , and the warm house smelled wonderful . Ma had always made every place they had ever lived wonderful . She called it making a place " homelike . " And here , in this small house that was n't even their own , she had done all the special things that made it home ...
