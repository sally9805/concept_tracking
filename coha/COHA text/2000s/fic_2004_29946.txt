Chapter One He hated cases that ended the way this one was going to end . Ethan Truax closed the file folder and placed his hands on the small round table . He regarded the man sitting in the undersized hotel room chair across from him . " You 're sure these numbers are solid ? " he asked neutrally . " Absolutely . " Dexter Morrow smiled his reassuring investment adviser 's smile . It did nothing to conceal the calculating expression in his eyes . " I took them straight off Katherine 's personal laptop last night after she went to sleep . " " You did say that you were close to the boss . " Morrow chuckled . It was the kind of man-to-man laugh that you heard in locker rooms and bars . " Real close . I can tell you from personal experience that she 's almost as good in bed as she is at running her company . " Ethan managed to keep his face expressionless but it was not easy . He was here to get the job done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window the Arizona sun shone down on the hotel 's blue-tiled pool and lounge area . It was warm and bright , the kind of day that made the state famous . But in here there was a chill in the air , and it was not coming from the air conditioner . Morrow casually cocked one ankle on his knee . The collar of his pricey , cream-colored polo shirt was edged with a thin black stripe . The shirt complemented the designer-label trousers and Euro-leather loafers . A gold Swiss watch gleamed on his wrist . Dexter Morrow had it made . He worked in a plush office , played golf in the middle of the week and entertained his clients in expensive places such as the Desert View Country Club . He was a winner here in Whispering Springs . Ethan was about to take it all away from him . " All right , " Ethan said quietly , more than ready for the endgame . " We 've got a deal . " Morrow glanced at the aluminum-sided suitcase that sat on the floor beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Small bills , as agreed . " Ethan reached down , grasped the handle of the suitcase and shoved it across the carpet toward Morrow . In a world where money could be transferred around the globe in the blink of an eye with computers , hard cash in a suitcase was still the transfer method of choice for those who did not want to leave any electronic tracks for the Feds or the SEC to uncover . Morrow picked up the suitcase and hoisted it onto the table . Ethan could tell that he was trying to appear cool but he was not doing a very good job of it . Morrow 's fingers shook a little when he unsnapped the locks . The guy was excited . Morrow raised the lid and looked at the stacks of neatly banded bills . Near-feverish anticipation radiated from him in heavy waves that in another man might have been mistaken for a sick lust . " You want to count it ? " Ethan asked softly . " That would take too long . I 've got to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start asking questions . " Morrow reached into the suitcase . " I 'll just do a random check . " Ethan got to his feet and put some distance between himself and the table . You never knew how a man would react when he realized he 'd been cornered . Morrow riffled through a stack of crisply cut blank paper bundled beneath the single real twenty-dollar bill . For a couple of seconds he did not appear to understand what had happened . Then comprehension struck . His tanned face flushed a dark red . He swung around to face Ethan . " What the hell is going on here ? " he snarled . The bathroom door opened . Katherine Compton walked out . " I was just about to ask you the same question , Dex , " she said . Her voice was flat with controlled anger . Her handsome features were tight and drawn . " But that would be a waste of time , would n't it ? I already know the answer . You just tried to sell those confidential bid figures to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered across Morrows face . " He said his name was Williams . " " It 's Truax , " Ethan said . " Ethan Truax of Truax Investigations . " Morrow 's hands clenched and unclenched at his sides . He appeared to be having difficulty connecting the dots . " You 're a private investigator ? " " Yes , " Ethan said . He was a little surprised by Morrow 's stunned expression . The guy had a history of scams like this one . You 'd think he 'd be accustomed to having things go wrong once in a while . It was n't like he was in any real jeopardy here , and he had to know that . Employers almost never prosecuted in these situations . They did n't want the negative publicity . " I hired Ethan last week when I started to get suspicious of you , Dex , " Katherine said . Morrow spread his hands in a pleading gesture . " Darling , you do n't understand . " " Unfortunately , I do , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for a while , but it 's over . " Morrow glanced briefly at Ethan . Rage darkened his face . He turned back to Katherine . " You 've got it all wrong . You 're making a huge mistake here . " " No , " Katherine said . " Listen to me . I knew there was a leak and I knew that it was very close to you . I was trying to identify the bastard who was screwing you . " " You were the bastard who was screwing me , " Katherine said . " That 's not true . I love you . I was trying to protect you . When Truax put out feelers letting me know that he was in the market for those bid figures , I thought I 'd finally gotten a lead on who was behind the inside leaks . I 'm here because I warned to set him up so that I could get him to spill some information . I was playing him . " " Do n't worry , " Katherine said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hurt the company . We 're all about trust and long-term business relationships at Compton Investments . " She smiled thinly . " But then , you already know that , do n't you , Dex ? After all , you 've worked for me for nearly a year . " " Katherine , you 've got this all wrong . " " You can go now , " she said . " A security guard will meet you at the office . He 'll stay with you while you clean out your desk , and then he 'll take your keys and escort you out of the building . You know the drill . Standard procedure in situations like this . No one will be told why you were let go . I 'm sure that everyone in the firm is aware that you and I were involved . The assumption will be made that we ended our personal relationship . Whenever that sort of thing happens , it is always the lower-ranking executive who leaves the firm , is n't it ? " " Katherine , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing it to us . I 'm doing it to you . Speaking of keys , I 'll take back the one to my from door that I gave you a few months ago . You wo n't be needing it anymore . " She held out her hand , palm up . " I 'm telling you , you 're making a mistake . " Morrow sounded hoarse now . " No , I 'm correcting the one I made when I got involved with you . My key , please . " Her tone sharpened without warning . " Now . " Morrow actually flinched . Ethan was impressed by the speed with which he got the gold key chain out of his pocket . Morrow fumbled the key off the ring and tossed it to Katherine . " I 'll have the locks changed , just to be on the safe side , of course . " Katherine dropped the key into her purse . " This morning after you left I packed up the things you 've been keeping at my place for the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dropped them off at your condo . " Morrow 's face worked furiously . He looked at Ethan . " This is your fault , you son of a bitch . You 'll regret it , I promise you that much . " Ethan took the tiny digital recorder out of his pocket . They all looked at it . Without a word he switched it off . Morrow 's jaw locked when he understood that the threat had been recorded . Without saying another word , he picked up his briefcase , his grip so fierce it squeezed the blood out of his knuckles . He went to the door , opened it and let himself out of the hotel room . There was a short silence . The room seemed to exhale deeply on a long sigh . Katherine did not take her gaze off the door . " Do you think he meant that threat he made to you , Ethan ? " " Do n't worry about it . " Ethan went to the table , picked up the packet of phony twenties and tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer not to take the risk of getting physical . When they get caught , they disappear as fast as possible . He 'll be out of town by this time tomorrow . Day after at the latest . In a couple of weeks he 'll be set up somewhere else , working on his next scam . " She grimaced . " I 'm not doing the world any favors by letting him go without bringing charges , am I ? " " Not your job to do the world a favor , " he said without inflection . " You 've got a responsibility to your company and your clients . It 's a tough call . " " No , " she said without hesitation , " it 's not . The company comes first . We 're in the middle of some extremely delicate negotiations . Between the three branches of Compton Investments here in Whispering Springs and in the Phoenix area , I 've got over fifty employees and hundreds of clients who will be directly affected by this deal . I 've got an obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO she is , he thought . Katherine shook her head , looking weary now that it was all over . " I never thought I 'd ever get taken in like that by a man , you know . I was always so sure of myself and my instincts . So sure that I could spot a phony . " " You did spot Morrow . " He closed the lid of the case and snapped it shut . " That 's why you picked up the phone and called me , remember ? " She was startled by that observation . After contemplating it for a moment , she nodded once , acknowledging the truth of the statement . " Yes , I did call you , did n't I ? " She walked resolutely toward the door . " Thank you for reminding me of that salient fact , Mr. Truax . In all the excitement , I had forgotten that I was the one who finally realized that there was something a little too good to be true about Dexter Morrow . " Ethan followed her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts were working just fine . " " I was actually thinking of marrying him , you know . " Ethan nodded . " It would have been my second marriage , " she added . Ethan nodded again . He stopped in front of the elevators and pressed the call button . " My first husband married me because he wanted to get his hands on my father 's company , " Katherine continued . " When he realized that I was the heir apparent and that I intended to run Compton myself , he filed for divorce . " Ethan prayed to the hotel gods in the vain hope that the elevator doors would open quickly . He understood the client 's need to talk after it was all over . He usually made it a point to listen patiently . He considered the debriefing part of the job . But today he just wanted to be done . A bone-deep weariness was creeping through him . The adrenaline rush that generally accompanied the satisfactory resolution of a case had not hit him back there in the hotel room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well lately . He knew the reason for the insomnia . It was November . November was a bad time . If the past two years were anything to go by , he would not sleep well again until December . Mercifully , the elevator doors opened . Katherine moved inside ahead of him . " Have you ever been married ? " she asked . " Oh , yeah , " Ethan said . Her brow climbed . " Divorced ? " " Three times . " She frowned . He was not surprised . One or two divorces were acceptable in this sophisticated day and age . There were excuses that could be made . Three , however , raised questions concerning possible innate character flaws . " Are you married now ? " Katherine asked . He thought about Zoe waiting for him at home . He summoned up the image of her sitting across from him at breakfast that morning , vibrant and vivid in an amethyst-colored pantsuit . He remembered how the morning sun streaming through the window had touched off sparks in her dark auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious , smoky eyes . His woman ; his wife . The mental picture was a talisman that he carried against the dark forces of November that swirled around him . But part of him dreaded the future because he was pretty sure that sooner or later those forces would triumph and drive Zoe away from him . He punched the lobby button . " Sort of , " he said . Chapter Two It had been a good day . She had not encountered any screaming walls . For the vast majority of interior designers , " screaming walls " implied an unfortunate choice of paint color or a really bad window treatment . But for a psychic designer who happened to be acutely sensitive to the invisible aura left in rooms that had been scenes of violence or strong passions , the term " screaming walls " could be interpreted quite literally . She had not set out in life with the intent of becoming an interior designer , Zoe reflected as she poured two glasses of wine . Her original plan had been to pursue a career as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband had changed everything . She was the first to admit that she had lost control for a time following Preston 's death . What could she say ? She had been a desperate woman . The cops had concluded that Preston had been shot by a transient burglar . The instant she had stepped into the cottage where the murder occurred she knew that was not what had happened . The walls had screamed bloody murder . In her passion to see justice done , she had made the near-fatal mistake of telling everyone who would listen that Preston had been killed by someone close to him . In a desperate attempt to convince her scheming in-laws that one of them was to blame , she had told them that she could sense the terrible rage that the murderer had felt clinging to the walls of the cottage . Big mistake . Her wild claims of psychic talents had given her in-laws the excuse they needed to have her committed against her will to a very private , very exclusive psychiatric hospital . She knew that she was not insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her stay there had very nearly turned the phony diagnosis into a reality . To this day , she still had nightmares in which she walked the halls of Candle Lake Manor . Zoe put the two glasses of wine on a tray together with a plate of cheese and crackers . She picked up the tray and carried it out into the living room of her small apartment . Ethan was on the sofa , leaning forward slightly , legs apart , elbows resting on his thighs . He wore a black crew-neck tee shirt and khaki pants . He held the remote loosely in one hand , absently clicking through the early evening news programs . She remembered her first impression of him that memorable day six weeks before in October when she had walked into his second-floor office on Cobalt Street . Continues ...
