The last remaining trove of Albert Einstein 's personal family letters is being opened to the public this week . They had been closely held by his stepdaughter Margot Einstein , who decreed that they remain sealed for 20 years after her death . Some of the letters are being published by Princeton University Press in the 10th volume produced by the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech , and they are a revelation . " Einstein 's private correspondence refutes the simplistic view of him as an isolated , remote man who immersed himself in his work at the expense of human contact , " says general editor Diana Kormos Buchwald . That is nowhere more true than in the tense months between April and December 1915 , when his family life was unraveling and he was racing  --  under brutal competitive pressure  --  to complete his general theory of relativity . <P> In 1915 , Albert Einstein was struggling to wrest from nature what would turn out to be his crowning achievement , perhaps the most beautiful theory in all of science . Ten years earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which said that time and space were each relative for observers moving at different constant velocities . Now he was trying to generalize the theory by conceiving of gravity as a curving of the fabric of something he called space-time . <P> It was an excruciating period . His marriage to Mileva Maric , an intense and brooding Serbian physicist who had helped him with the math of his 1905 paper , had just exploded . She had left him in Berlin and moved to Zurich with their sons Hans Albert , 11 , and Eduard , 5 . Suffering from acute stomach pains exacerbated by the food shortages of World War I , he was being nursed by a first cousin , Elsa Einstein , whom he would eventually marry . <P> His letters , including some made public this week , show how his personal and scientific struggles intertwined in 1915 , culminating in his great triumph that fall . The tale begins with two letters written in early April by Hans Albert ( known as Adu ) , begging his father to visit him and his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dear Papa , Imagine , Tete can already multiply and divide , and I am doing gometetry ( geometry ) , as Tete says . Mama assigns me problems ; we have a little booklet ; I could do the same with you then as well . But why have n't you written us anything lately ? I just think : " At Easter you 're going to be here and we 'll have a Papa again . " Yours , Adu !
