<p> When the news broke last month that significant questions had been raised about an increase in the risk of a heart attack for users of Avandia , I followed the reports with a bit more avidity than most . <p> As a 50-year-old with a history of smoking and family heart disease  --  not to mention a bit of a paunch  --  I 'm in the sweet spot for a cardiovascular event . More to the point , I am a Type 2 diabetic , and this year , my endocrinologist thought I might benefit from Avandia , a drug made by GlaxoSmithKline that helps diabetics use the insulin they produce more effectively . <p> The headline takeaway last month was that a published study by Dr. Steven Nissen , a noted cardiologist and the man who first alerted the public to the dangers of Vioxx , found that Avandia actually increased heart attack risk by 43 percent and sported a 64 percent increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes . <p> Dr. Nissen 's conclusions derived from a meta-analysis of 42 clinical trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still , he then went on to call Avandia use a " virtual public health emergency . " <p> After reading that , I reached into my medicine cabinet with a pair of tongs , picked up my Avandia prescription and dropped it into the wastebasket . <p> Admittedly , that was the reaction of the Old-Media Man , the person who starts his day reading the morning headlines in the local paper ( in my case , The New York Times ) or jumps out of his recliner after watching an item on the " CBS Evening News . " After calming down , I remembered that I am also a New-Media Man , the kind who has trained himself to drill down and look past the headlines . And an entire niche of blogs and digital news sources on relevant subjects  --  drug risks , Big Pharma , diabetes  --  were at my fingertips for the mining . <p> And here is what I found : everything , except insight . <p> As it turns out , the Web 's penchant for polarized discourse is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential elections . And because the Avandia controversy manages to unite three sectors not held in the highest public esteem  --  Big Pharma , Big Media and Big Government ( the lawyers will be along any minute )  --  it has led to a lot of hyperbole online . And as Michael Moore is about to demonstrate with his new movie , " Sicko , " people are often willing to believe the worst about the health care industry and they are rarely disappointed . <p> " The F.D.A. operates in conspiracy with Big Pharma to hide the dangers of prescription drugs that pose a real safety threat to Americans , " suggested NewsTarget.com ( **30;99;TOOLONG ) , adding that , " Statistically , the F.D.A. has become a far greater threat to the safety of Americans than terrorism . " <p> There is a whole raft of sites that are far more friendly to Big Pharma like DrugWonks.com , which seems to think that the study is much ado about not much , suggesting , " Nissen 's entire approach is a case study of how to use statistical tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clears things up . <p> The controversy is turning into something of a throwdown between cardiologists , who look after the heart , and endocrinologists , who want to use every safe and effective drug in the tool belt to get blood sugars down . The Daily Diabetic ( www.daily-diabetic.com ) spoke for many people who are using or have used Avandia : " The consuming public is just at the mercy of these two camps throwing their own clinical data for us to interpret . " <p> Derek Lowe , a research scientist who has worked for pharmaceutical companies , writes a blog , In the Pipeline ( **25;131;TOOLONG ) . <p> " It is falling into a fairly predictable template , in part because we have had a number of drug safety issues and scares , so this story ends up getting slotted into the same mold as Vioxx on parts of the Web , " he said in an interview . " So we end up reading about the evil mustache twirlers in Big Pharma who knew it was toxic and marketed it anyway . " <p> Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off as cartoon villains is that they have been known to act like them , said Ed Silverman , who covers the industry for The Star-Ledger in Newark , and writes a blog called Pharmalot ( pharmalot.com/ ) . <p> " There is a thread here that continues , that collectively the industry has failed to anticipate and react to the problems with Avandia , " he said . " Glaxo has put some ads out and put out a few key executives for interviews , but things move a lot faster now than they used to . " <p> Many doctors , and indeed the F.D.A. , say they are going to wait for a 4,400-patient study that is under way before they draw hard and fast conclusions , but those results wo n't be due until 2009 . It might end up being something like waiting for Godot  --  many of the people in the trials read the same headlines I did and promptly dumped the regimen . ( And interim results , put out by Glaxo to counter criticism , suggested to some researchers that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , along with the company 's stock , probably wo n't be picking up a lot of steam anytime soon . ) <p> Dr. Peter Rost , an industry whistle-blower and the author of the Question Authority blog ( peterrost.blogspot.com/ ) , said there was extreme value in consumers using the Web as a health resource , even if it is noisy and all over the road . <p> " Yes , you have to sort it out and you have to evaluate , but all of the information used to belong to the moneyed and the powerful , " he said . " Those barriers do n't exist on the Web , so people have access to all sorts of information about Avandia . " <p> Perhaps that 's true , after some time spent researching the whole issue , I decided to just back away from the mouse . Data is not knowledge , and information is not insight ; consumers still have to make their own judgments about the agendas that are at work . <p> When it comes to meta-analysis on breaking issues , the Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Wednesday , I will see my endocrinologist . We will chat for a few minutes about Avandia and no doubt he 'll smile when I entertain him with all that I have learned on the Web . Then after he tells me what he thinks , I will follow my doctor 's orders . <p> #
