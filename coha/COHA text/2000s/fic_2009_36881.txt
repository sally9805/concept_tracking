Down and Out <p> " Moggle , " Aya whispered . " You awake ? " <p> Something moved in the darkness . A pile of dorm uniforms rustled , as if a small animal stirred underneath . Then a shape slipped from among the folds of spider silk and cotton . It rose into the air and floated toward Aya 's bed . Tiny lenses gazed at her face , curious and alert , reflecting starlight from the open window . <p> Aya grinned . " Ready to go to work ? " <p> In answer , Moggle flashed its night-lights . <p> " Ouch ! " Aya squeezed her eyes shut . " Do n't do that ! It 's vision-wrecking ! " <p> She lay in bed another moment , waiting for the spots to fade . The hovercam nuzzled against her shoulder apologetically . <p> " It 's okay , Moggle-chan , " she whispered . " I just wish I had infrared too . " <p> Lots of people her age had infrared vision , but Aya 's parents had this thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck in the Prettytime , when everyone had to wait until they turned sixteen to change themselves . Crumblies could be so fashion-missing . <p> So Aya was stuck with her big nose  --  definitely ugly  --  and her normal vision . When she 'd moved out of her home and into a dorm , her parents had given her permission to get an eyescreen and skintenna , but that was only so they could ping whenever they wanted . Still , it was better than nothing . She flexed her finger and the city interface flickered to life , layering across her vision . <p> " Uh-oh , " she said to Moggle . " Almost midnight . " <p> She did n't remember dozing off , but the tech-head bash must have already started . It was probably crowded by now , packed enough with surge-monkeys and manga-heads that nobody would notice one ugly extra snooping around . <p> Besides , Aya Fuse was an expert at being invisible . Her face rank was proof of that . It sat unmoving in the corner of her vision : 451,396 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city of a million , that was total extra-land . She 'd had her own feed for almost two years now , had kicked a great story just a week ago , and was still anonymous . <p> Well , tonight was finally going to change that . <p> " Let 's go , Moggle , " she whispered , and slipped out of bed . <p> A gray robe lay in a shapeless puddle at her feet . Aya pulled it over her dorm uniform and tied it at the waist , then perched on the windowsill . She turned to face the night sky slowly , easing one leg , then the other , out into the cool air . <p> She slipped on her crash bracelets , glancing at the ground fifty meters below . <p> " Okay , that 's dizzy-making . " <p> At least no monitors were skulking around down there . That was the kick thing about a thirteenth-story room  --  no one expected you to sneak out your window . <p> Thick clouds hung low in the sky , reflecting worklights from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine needles and rain , and Aya wondered if she was going to freeze in her disguise . But she could n't exactly throw a dorm jacket over the robe and expect people not to notice . <p> " Hope you 're all charged up , Moggle . It 's drop-time . " <p> The hovercam drifted past her shoulder and out the window , settling close against her chest . It was the size of half a soccer ball , sheathed in hard plastic and warm to the touch . As Aya wrapped her arms around Moggle , she felt her bracelets trembling , caught in the magnetic currents of the hovercam 's lifters . <p> She squeezed her eyes shut . " Ready ? " <p> Moggle shivered in her arms . <p> Clinging to the hovercam with all her strength , Aya pushed herself into the void . <br> <p> Getting out was much simpler these days . <p> For Aya 's fifteenth birthday , Ren Machino  --  her big brother 's best friend  --  had modified Moggle . She 'd only asked him to make it quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most tech-heads , Ren took pride in his mods . The new Moggle was waterproof , shockproof , and powerful enough to carry an Aya-size passenger through the air . <p> Close enough , anyway . With her arms wrapped around the hovercam , she fell no faster than a cherry blossom twirling toward the ground . It was much easier than stealing a bungee jacket . And except for the nervous-making moment of jumping , it was kind of fun . <p> She watched the windows flicker past  --  dreary rooms full of standard-requisition squalor . No one famous lived in Akira Hall , just loads of face-missing extras wearing generic designs . A few ego-kickers sat talking into their cams , watched by no one . The average face rank here was six hundred thousand , despair-making and pathetic . <p> Obscurity in all its horror . <p> Back in the Prettytime , Aya vaguely remembered , you just asked for awesome clothes or a new hoverboard and they popped out of the hole in the wall like magic . But these days , the hole would n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend . And getting merits meant taking classes or doing chores  --  whatever the Good Citizen Committee commanded , basically . <p> Moggle 's lifters connected with the metal grid beneath the ground , and Aya bent her knees , rolling as she hit . The wet grass squished beneath her like a sodden sponge , soft but shivery cold . <p> She let go of Moggle and lay for a moment on the rain-soaked earth , letting her heartbeat slow down . " You okay ? " <p> Moggle flashed its night-lights again . <p> " Okay ... that 's still blind-making . " <p> Ren had also modified the hovercam 's brain . True AI might still be illegal , but the new Moggle was more than just a wedge of circuitry and lifters . Since Ren 's tinkering , it had learned Aya 's favorite angles , when to pan and zoom , and even how to track her eyes for cues . <p> But for some reason , it did n't get the whole night-vision thing . <p> She kept her eyes closed , listening hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No footsteps , no whir of monitor drones . Nothing but the muffled thump of music from the dorm . <p> Aya rose to her feet and brushed herself off . Not that anyone would notice the wet grass clinging to her ; Reputation Bombers dressed to disappear . The robe was hooded and shapeless , the perfect disguise for party-crashing . <p> With a twist of a crash bracelet , a hoverboard rose from its hiding place in the bushes . Stepping on , Aya faced the glittering lights of Prettyville . <p> Funny how everyone still called it that , even if most of the residents were n't pretty anymore  --  not in the old sense , anyway . Prettyville was full of pixel-skins and surge-monkeys , and plenty of other strange new fads and fashions . You could choose among a million kinds of beauty or weirdness , or even keep your natural-born face your whole life . These days " pretty " meant whatever got you noticed . <p> But one thing about Prettyville was still the same : If you had n't turned sixteen , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all the good stuff happened . <p> Especially if you were an extra , a loser , an unknown . <p> Gazing at the city , she felt engulfed by her own invisibility . Each of its sparkling lights stood for one of the million people who had never heard of Aya Fuse . Who probably never would . <p> She sighed , urging her hoverboard forward . <p> The government feeds always said that the Prettytime was gone forever , freeing humanity from centuries of bubbleheadedness . They claimed that the divisions among uglies , pretties , and crumblies had all been washed away . That the last three years had unleashed a host of new technologies , setting the future in motion again . <p> But as far as Aya could see , the mind-rain had n't changed everything .... <p> It still pretty much sucked , being fifteen . <p> Copyright 2006 by Scott Westerfeld <p> TECH-HEADS <p> " Are you getting this ? " she whispered . <p> Moggle was already shooting , the shimmer of safety fireworks reflecting from its lenses . Hot-air balloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooftops in bungee jackets . It looked like a party back in the old days : self-indulgent and eye-kickingly radiant . <p> At least , that was how Aya 's older brother always described the Prettytime . Back then everyone had gotten one big operation on their sixteenth birthday . It made you beautiful , but secretly changed your personality , leaving you brain-missing and easily controlled . <p> Hiro had n't been a bubblehead very long ; he 'd turned sixteen only a few months before the mind-rain had arrived and cured the pretties . He liked to claim that those months had been awful  --  as if being shallow and vain was such a stretch for him . But he never denied that the parties had been awesome . <p> Not that Hiro would be here tonight ; he was way too famous . Aya checked her eyescreen : the average face rank inside was about twenty thousand . Compared with her older brother , the people at this bash were total extras . <p> Compared to an ugly ranked at half a million , though , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she whispered . " We 're not wanted here . " <p> Aya flipped up the hood of her robe , and stepped out of the shadows . <br> <p> Inside , the air was full of hovercams . From Moggle-size all the way down to paparazzi swarms , each cam no bigger than a champagne cork . <p> There was always plenty to see at tech-head parties , crazy people and kick new gadgets . Maybe people were n't as beautiful as back during the Prettytime , but parties were a lot more interesting : serious surge-monkeys with snake fingers and medusa hair ; smart-matter clothes that rippled like flags in a breeze ; safety fireworks skittering along the floor , dodging feet and sizzling incense as they passed . <p> Tech-heads lived for new technologies  --  they loved showing off their latest tricks , and kickers loved putting them on their feeds . The endless cycle of invention and publicity bumped everyone 's face rank , so everyone was happy . <p> Everyone who got invited , anyway . <p> A hovercam buzzed close , almost low enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , making her way toward a cluster of Reputation Bombers . Here in public they all kept their hoods up , like a bunch of pre-Rusty Buddhist monks . They were already bombing : chanting the name of some random member of the clique , trying to convince the city interface to bump his face rank . <p> Aya bowed to the group and joined the blur of name-dropping , keeping her ugly face covered . <p> The whole point of bombing was to dissect the city 's reputation algorithms : How many mentions of your name did it take to crack the top thousand ? How quickly did you drop if everyone stopped talking about you ? The clique was one big controlled experiment , which was why they all wore the same anonymous outfits . <p> But Aya figured most Bombers did n't care about the math . They were just cheaters , pathetic extras trying to talk themselves famous . It was like how they 'd manufactured celebrities back in Rusty days , a handful of feeds hyping a few bubbleheads and ignoring everybody else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone was telling you who to talk about ? <p> But Aya chanted away like a good little Bomber , keeping her attention on her eyescreen , watching the view from Moggle 's lenses . The hovercam drifted over the crowd , picking out faces one by one . <p> The secret clique Aya had discovered had to be here somewhere . Only tech-heads could pull off a trick like that .... <p> She 'd spotted them three nights before , riding on top of one of the new mag-lev trains , traveling at insane speeds through the factory district  --  so fast that all the shots Moggle had taken were too grainy and blurry to use . <p> Aya had to find them again . Whoever kicked a crazy trick like mag-lev riding would be instantly famous . <p> But Moggle was already distracted , watching a gaggle of NeoFoodies underneath a pink blob floating in the air . They were drinking from it with meter-long straws , like astronauts recapturing a spilled cup of tea . <p> NeoFoodies were old news  --  Hiro had kicked a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient spores , made ice cream with liquid nitrogen , and injected flavors into weird forms of matter . The floating pink stuff looked like an aerogel , dinner with the density of a soap bubble . <p> A small blob broke off and floated past . Aya grimaced , smelling rice and salmon . Eating strange substances might be a great way to bump your face rank , but she preferred her sushi heavier than air . <p> She liked being around tech-heads , though , even if she had to hide . Most of the city was still stuck in the past , trying to rediscover haiku , religion , the tea ceremony  --  all the things that had been lost in the Prettytime , when everyone had been brain-damaged . But tech-heads were building the future , making up for three centuries of missing progress . <p> This was the place to find stories . <p> Something in her eyescreen sent a flicker of recognition through her . <p> " Hold it , Moggle ! " she hissed . " Pan left . " <p> There behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloblets , was a familiar face . <p> " That 's one of them ! Zoom in . " <p> The girl was about eighteen , classic new-pretty surge with slightly manga eyes . She was wearing a hoverball rig , floating gracefully ten centimeters above the floor . And she had to be famous : A reputation bubble surrounded her , a cohort of friends and groupies to keep extras away . <p> " Get close enough to hear them , " Aya whispered . Moggle eased to the edge of the bubble , and soon its microphones caught the girl 's name . Data spilled across Aya 's eyescreen .... <p> Eden Maru was a hoverball player  --  left wing for the Swallows , who 'd been city champions last year . She was also legendary for her lifter mods . <p> According to all the feeds , Eden had just dumped her boyfriend because of " a difference in ambition . " Of course , that was just code for " she got too famous for him . " Eden 's face rank had hit ten thousand after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter million . Everyone knew she needed to hook up with someone more face-equal . <p> But none of the rumors mentioned Eden 's new mag-lev riding clique . She must be keeping that a secret , waiting for the right moment to reveal the trick . <p> Kicking it first would make Aya famous overnight . <p> " Track her , " she told Moggle , then went back to chanting . *** <p> Half an hour later , Eden Maru headed out . <p> Slipping away from the Bombers was bliss-making  --  Aya had chanted the name " Yoshio Nara " about a million times . She hoped Yoshio enjoyed his pointless face rank bump , because she never wanted to hear his name again . <p> From Moggle 's midair view , Eden Maru was slipping through the door  --  alone , no entourage . She had to be headed off to meet her secret clique . <p> " Stay close to her , Moggle , " Aya croaked . All that chanting had left her throat dry . She spotted a drinks tray hovering past . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grabbing a glass at random , Aya guzzled it down . The alcohol sent a shudder through her  --  not exactly what she needed . She snatched another drink with lots of ice and pushed her way toward the door . <p> A gaggle of pixel-skins stood in her way , their bodies rippling through colors like drunken chameleons . She slipped among them , recognizing a couple of their faces from the surge-monkey feeds . A little reputation shiver went through her . <p> Out on the mansion steps Aya spilled the drink out through her fingers , saving the ice cubes . She tipped the glass back into her mouth and started crunching . After the sweltering party a mouthful of ice was heavenly . <p> " Interesting surge , " someone said . <p> Aya froze .... Her hood had fallen back , revealing her ugly face . <p> " Um , thanks . " The words came out muffled , and Aya gulped down cold shards of ice . The breeze hit her sweaty face , and she realized how fashion-missing she must look . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that nose ? " <p> Aya managed to shrug , suddenly word-missing . In her eyescreen she could see Eden Maru already flying across town , but tearing her gaze from the boy was impossible . He was a manga-head : eyes huge and glistening , his delicate face inhumanly beautiful . Long , tapered fingers stroked his perfect cheek as he stared at her . <p> That was the weird thing : He was staring at her . <p> But he was gorgeous , and she was ugly . <p> " Let me guess , " he said . " From some pre-Rusty painting ? " <p> " Uh , not really . " She touched her nose , swallowing the last few shards of ice . " It 's more , um ... randomly generated ? " <p> " Of course . It 's so unique . " He bowed . " Frizz Mizuno . " <p> As Aya returned the bow , her eyescreen displayed his face rank : 4,612 . A reputation shiver went through her , the realization that she was talking to someone important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aya to give her own name . And once she did that , he 'd know her face rank , and then his wonderful gaze would turn somewhere more interesting . Even if in some logic-missing , mind-rain way he liked her ugly face , being an extra was simply pathetic . <p> Besides , her nose was way too big . <p> She twisted a crash bracelet to call her hoverboard . " My name 's Aya . But I kind of ... have to go now . " <p> He bowed . " Of course . People to see , reputations to bomb . " <p> Aya laughed , looking down at the robe . " Oh , this . I 'm not really ... I 'm sort of incognito . " <p> " Incognito ? " His smile was eye-kicking . " You 're very mysterious . " <p> Her board slipped up next to the stairs . Aya stared down at it , hesitating . Moggle was already half a kilometer away , trailing Eden Maru through the darkness at high speed , but part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at her . <p> " I 'm not trying to be mysterious , " she said . " It 's just working out that way . " <p> He laughed . " I want to know your last name , Aya . But I think you 're purposely not telling me . " <p> " Sorry , " she squeaked , and stepped onto the board . " But I have to go after someone . She 's sort of ... getting away . " <p> He bowed , his smile broadening . " Enjoy the chase . " <p> She leaned forward and shot into the darkness , his laughter in her ears . <p> Copyright 2006 by Scott Westerfeld <p> UNDERGROUND <p> Eden Maru knew how to fly . <p> Full-body lifter rigs were standard gear for hoverball players , but most people never dared to wear them . Each piece had its own lifter : the shin and elbow pads , even the boots in some rigs . One wrong twitch of your fingers could send all those magnets in different directions , which was an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headfirst into a wall . Unlike when you fall off a hoverboard , crash bracelets would n't save you from your own clumsiness . <p> But none of this seemed to worry Eden Maru . In Aya 's eyescreen , she was zigzagging through the new construction site , using the half-finished buildings and open storm drains as her private obstacle course . <p> Even Moggle , who was stuffed with lifters and only twenty centimeters across , was finding it tricky keeping up . <p> Aya tried to focus on her own hoverboarding , but she was still half-hypnotized by Frizz Mizuno , dazzled by his attention . Since the mind-rain had broken down the boundaries between ages , Aya had talked to plenty of pretties . It was n't like the old days , when your friends never talked to you after they got the operation . But no pretty had ever looked at her that way . <p> Or was she kidding herself ? Maybe Frizz 's intense gaze made everyone feel this way . His eyes were so huge , just like the old Rusty drawings that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the city interface about him . She 'd never seen him on the feeds , but with a face rank below five thousand , Frizz had to be known for something besides eye-kicking beauty . <p> But for now Aya had a story to chase , a reputation to build . If Frizz was ever going to look at her that way again , she could n't be so face-missing . <p> Her eyescreen began to flicker . Moggle 's signal was fading , falling out of range of the city network as it followed Eden underground . <p> The signal shimmered with static , then went dark .... <p> Aya banked to a halt , a shudder passing through her . Losing Moggle was always unnerving , like looking down on a sunny day to find her shadow gone . <p> She stared at the last image the hovercam had sent : the inside of a storm drain , grainy and distorted by infrared . Eden Maru was curled up tight , a human cannonball zooming through the confines of the tunnel , headed so deep that Moggle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to find Eden again was to follow her down . <p> Aya leaned forward , urging her hoverboard back into motion . The new construction site rose up around her , dozens of iron skeletons and gaping holes . <p> After the mind-rain , nobody wanted to live in fashion-missing Prettytime buildings . Nobody famous , anyway . So the city was expanding wildly , plundering nearby Rusty ruins for metal . There were even rumors that the city planned to tear open the ground to look for fresh iron , like the earth-damaging Rusties had three centuries ago . <p> The unfinished towers flashed past , the steel frames making her board shudder . Hoverboards needed metal below them to fly , but too many magnetic fields made them shivery . Aya eased back her speed , checking for Moggle again . <p> Nothing . The hovercam was still underground . <p> A huge excavation came into sight , the foundation of some future skyscraper . Along its raw dirt floor , puddles of afternoon rain reflected the starlit sky , like jagged slivers of mirror . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , an entry to the network of storm drains beneath the city . <p> A month ago , Aya had kicked a story about a new graffiti clique , uglies who left artwork for future gener-ations . They painted the insides of unfinished tunnels and conduits , letting their work be sealed up like time capsules . No one would see the paintings until long after the city collapsed , when its ruins were rediscovered by some future civilization . It was all very mind-rain , a rumination about how the eternal Prettytime had been more fragile than it seemed . <p> The story had n't bumped Aya 's face rank  --  stories about uglies never did  --  but she and Moggle had spent a week playing hide-and-seek through the construction site . She was n't afraid of the underground . <p> Letting her board drop , Aya ducked past idle lifter drones and hoverstruts , diving toward the tunnel mouth . She bent her knees , pulled in her arms , and plunged into absolute blackness .... <p> Her eyescreen flickered once  --  the hovercam had to be nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , trickling drainage the only sound . As the worklights behind her faded to a faint orange glow , Aya slowed her board to a crawl , guiding herself with one hand sliding along the tunnel wall . <p> Moggle 's signal flickered back on ... and held . <p> Eden Maru was standing upright , flexing her arms . She was someplace spacious and dead-black in infrared , extending as far as Moggle 's cams could see . <p> What was down there ? <p> More human forms shimmered in the grainy darkness . They floated above the black plain , the lozenge shapes of hoverboards glowing beneath their feet . <p> Aya smiled . She 'd found them , those crazy girls who rode mag-lev trains . <p> " Move in and listen , " she whispered . <p> As Moggle drifted closer , Aya remembered a place the graffiti uglies had bragged about finding  --  a huge reservoir where the city stored runoff from the rainy season , an underground lake in absolute darkness . <p> Through Moggle 's microphones , a few echoing words reached her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I always said your big face would get you into trouble , Eden . " <p> " Well , this should n't take long . She 's just behind me . " <p> Aya froze . Who was just behind Eden ? She glanced over her shoulder .... <p> Nothing but the glimmer of water trickling down the tunnel . <p> Then her eyescreen faded again . Aya swore , flexing her ring finger : off/on ... but her vision stayed black . <p> " Moggle ? " she hissed . <p> No flicker in the eyescreen , no response . She tried to access the hovercam 's diagnostics , its audio feed , the remote flying controls . Nothing worked . <p> But Moggle was so close  --  at most twenty meters away . Why could n't she connect ? <p> Aya urged her board forward slowly , listening hard , trying to peer through the darkness . The wall slipped away from her hand , the echoes of a huge space opening around her . Trickles of rainwater chorused from a dozen drains , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She needed to see .... <p> Then Aya remembered the control panel of her hoverboard . In this absolute darkness , even a few pinpricks of light would make a difference . <p> She knelt and booted the controls . Their soft blue glow revealed sweeping walls of ancient brick , patched in places with modern ceramics and smart matter . A broad stone ceiling arched overhead , like the vault of some underground cathedral . <p> But no Moggle . <p> Aya drifted slowly through the darkness , letting the subtle air currents carry her board , listening hard . A smooth lake of black water spread out a few meters below her board . <p> Then she heard something nearby , the slightest catch of breath , and turned .... <p> In the dim blue glow , an ugly face stared back at her . The girl stood on a hoverboard , holding Moggle in her arms . She gave Aya a cold smile . <p> " We thought you might come after this . " <p> " Hey ! " Aya said . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the darkness and sent Aya 's hoverboard rocking . <p> " Watch it ! " Aya shouted . <p> Strong hands pushed her , and she took two unsteady steps backward . The hoverboard shifted , trying to stay under her feet . Aya stuck her arms out , wobbling like a littlie on ice skates . <p> " Knock it off ! What are you  --  " <p> From all directions , more hands shoved and prodded her  --  Aya spun wildly , blind and defenseless . Then her board was kicked away , and she was tumbling through the air . <p> The water struck her face with a cold , hard slap . <p> Copyright 2006 by Scott Westerfeld <br> Continues ...
