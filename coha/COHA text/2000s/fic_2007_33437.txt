Chapter One Ghost Wife SHE WAS HIS FIRST WIFE , BUT AT THE MOMENT when he first saw her she was a seventeen-year-old girl named Arlyn Singer who stood out on the front porch on an evening that seemed suspended in time . Arlyn 's father had just died and the funeral dinner had ended only hours earlier . It was a somber gathering : a dozen neighbors seated around the heavy mahogany dining-room table no one had used for over a decade . Now there were pans of macaroni and cheese and a red velvet cake and a huge platter of fruit , food enough to last a month if Arlie had had an appetite . Arlyn 's father had been a ferryboat captain , the center of her world , especially in his last years ; the captain had burned brighter in the grasp of his illness , a shining star in the dark . A usually silent man , he began to tell stories . There were tales of rocks that appeared in the dark , of mysterious reefs whose only purpose seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known who had never come back . With a red crayon , he drew charts of stars that could lead a lost man home . He told of a tribe who lived on the other side of the water , in far-off Connecticut , who could sprout wings in the face of disaster . They looked like normal people until the ship went down , or the fire raged , and then they suddenly revealed themselves . Only then did they manage their escape . On his night table there was a collection of stones the captain said he had swallowed when he was a young man ; he 'd gone down with a ship and had been the lone survivor . One minute he 'd been standing on deck , and the next , he 'd been above it all , in the sky . He 'd fallen hard and fast into the surf of Connecticut , with a mouth and a belly full of stones . When the doctor came to tell the captain there was no hope , they had a drink together and instead of ice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will bring you good luck , he 'd told the doctor . All I want is for my daughter to be happy . That 's all the luck I need . Arlyn had sobbed at his bedside and begged her father not to leave her , but that was not an option or a choice . The last advice the captain had given her , while his voice still held out , was that the future was an unknown and unexpected country , and that Arlyn should be prepared for almost anything . She had been grief stricken as her father lay dying but now she felt weightless , the way people do when they 're no longer sure they have a reason to be connected to this world . The slightest breeze could have carried her away , into the night sky , across the universe . Arlyn held on to the porch banister and leaned out over the azaleas . Red and pink flowers , filled with buds . Arlyn was an optimist , despite her current situation . She was young enough not to see a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful object into which anything might be poured . She whispered a bargain , as though her whispering could make it true . The first man who walks down the street will be my one love and I will be true to him as long as he 's true to me . She turned around twice and held her breath as a way to seal the bargain . She wore her favorite shoes , ones her father had bought her in Connecticut , leather slippers so light she felt as though she were barefoot . Her red hair reached her waist . She had seventy-four freckles on her face - she had counted - and a long , straight nose her father had assured her was elegant rather than large . She watched the sky darken . There was a line of ashes up above , a sprinkling of chimney soot . Perhaps her father was up there , watching over her . Perhaps he was knocking on his casket , begging to be let out . Or maybe he was here with her still , in her heart , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life without him . Arlie felt her aloneness inside her , but she was hopeful , too . The past was done with . Now she was made out of glass , transparent and clear . She was an instant in time . One damp evening , two stars in the sky , a line of soot , a chattering gathering of neighbors who barely knew her in the dining room . She had convinced herself that her future would arrive on the street where she 'd lived her whole life if only she 'd wait long enough . If she trusted in fate . In the living room , people spoke about Arlyn as though she had died right along with her father . She was n't a pretty girl , after all , just plain and freckly . She had a high-school diploma and , as far as anyone could tell , no particular skills . One summer she 'd worked in an ice-cream shop , and in high school she 'd had a dog-washing service , shampooing basset hounds and poodles in the kitchen sink . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might blow off in the next big storm . People felt pity , but as everyone knew , that was n't an emotion that lasted long . A low horn sounded as the ferry came across the water from Bridgeport ; the fact that there would be fog tonight was discussed as the women cleaned up , wiping off the table , putting away the pound cakes and the casseroles before going out to the porch to say good night to Arlyn . It was a heavy , salt-laced fog that had settled , the kind that circled lampposts and street signs and made folks lose their way . A damp , soft night . The neighbors assumed that once they 'd left , Arlyn would go inside her empty house . Surely she would walk along the hall where her father 's coats still hung on the rack , then take the flight of stairs the captain had n't been able to manage for the past six months . She would edge past his silent room . No more coughing all night long . No more calls for water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold her skin felt like ice ; still she remained on the porch . Her father had said to prepare for the future , and Arlyn was ready and willing . Her destiny was sure to come to her in her darkest hour . That was now , this damp , sad night . It took some time , but after three hours Arlie 's faith was rewarded . By then the fog had turned to a light rain and the streets smelled like fish . A car stopped ; there was a young man inside , lost , on his way to a party . When he got out to ask directions , Arlyn noticed he was taller than her father . She liked tall men . His hair was combed back . He had beautiful pale eyes , a cool gray color . As he approached he shouted , " Hello . " His voice was not what she expected - flat and nasal . That did n't matter . Anything could happen now . Arlyn took a step back in order to study him . Perhaps the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to her in a banged-up old Saab his dad had given him . He could have been anyone , after all . A murderer , an ex-con , a man who would rip the heart from her chest . " I 'm lost , " the young man explained . Usually he would have kept on driving ; he had never in his life stopped to ask for directions . But he was late , and he was the sort of person who was usually on time . Veering from punctuality made him anxious ; it made him do stupid things . For instance , he had circled around this particular block twice . Before leaving , he 'd forgotten to check to make sure his gas tank was full and now he worried that he would n't be able to find a service station before he ran out . The young man 's name was John Moody and he was a senior at Yale studying architecture ; he recognized Arlie 's father 's house as an Italianate worker 's cottage , built , he would guess , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . Not kept up , of course - the roof looked like flypaper , the shingles were badly in need of paint - but charming in a run-down way just as the girl with the long red hair was charming despite her dreadful clothes and the freckles scattered across her pale skin . Arlyn was wearing an overcoat though it was April . " You 're freezing , " John Moody said . Arlyn took this as concern rather than mere statement of fact . The truth was , she was shivering in the cold light of her future , the light that had been cast by this tall young man who had no idea where he was . Arlyn felt faint . Fluttery , really . Her whole life had been spent in a cocoon ; she had been waiting for this hanging globe of an evening . This is when everything else begins . Whatever happens next is where my life will lead me . John Moody came up the porch steps . Rickety . In need of repair . John took a moment to catch his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person having the party . My roommate Nathaniel 's sister . I do n't even know why I 'm here . " His heart was pounding uncomfortably hard . His father had had a heart attack earlier in the year . Was he having one , too ? Well , he 'd never liked speaking to strangers ; he 'd never liked speaking at all . John Moody was a champion of quiet and order . Architecture meant rules one could depend upon . He was a devotee of the clean line and of truth in form , without frills or complications . He did n't like messes of any sort . Arlyn looked over the directions John 's roommate had given him . They were all wrong . " If you want to go to Smithtown , you turn at the corner by the harbor and keep going west . Four towns over . " " That far ? " John Moody had been working hard at Yale throughout the semester , trying to distinguish himself ; all at once he felt exhausted . " I did n't realize I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know how tired you are until you close your eyes . " There was no rush , was there ? Time was suspended ; it was n't moving at all . They went inside and John Moody lay down on the couch . He had long legs and large feet and he fell asleep easily . He could not remember the last time he 'd had a dream . " Just for a minute , " he said . " Until I get my second wind . " Arlyn sat on a hard-backed chair , still wearing her overcoat , still shivering . She watched John fall asleep . She had the feeling that whatever happened next would be the true test of whether or not they were meant to be . John 's eyelids fluttered ; his chest rose and fell . He was a beautiful sleeper , calm , unmoving , peaceful . It felt so right to have him there . The room was littered with chairs that had been pulled into a circle by the visiting neighbors . When Arlyn 's father had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sedated into sleep , he had moaned and thrashed in his dreams and tore at the bedsheets . Sometimes Arlyn would leave him , just for a short time , for a breath of air , a moment alone . She 'd walk down to the harbor and look into the darkness . She could hear the water , but she could n't see it ; she could n't see anything at all . All she 'd wanted , then and now , was a man who could sleep . At last he was here . Arlie left John Moody and went into the kitchen . She had n't eaten for three days and she realized she was famished . Arlie went to the refrigerator and took out nearly everything - the tins of baked beans , the homemade strudels , the ham , the sweet-potato pie , the last piece of red velvet cake . She sat at the table and ate three days ' worth of food . When she was finished she went to the sink , filled it with soapy water , and cleaned the pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse her of being light-headed . She was rational . No doubt about it . She knew what she was doing . She took off her coat , her black dress , her slip , her underwear , even the soft leather shoes her father had bought her . She turned out the light . Her breath moved inside her ribs like a butterfly . In and out . Waiting . If he walks through the door , my life will begin . And indeed , when John Moody came into the kitchen , time hurtled forward , no longer suspended . He was walking to her , shocked by his good fortune and by the dreaminess of the evening , the extreme weirdness of setting out from Yale as a bored college boy and ending up here , in this kitchen . Arlie looked like a ghost , someone he 'd imagined , a woman made of moonlight and milk . The neighbors who thought she was too plain to notice would have been surprised to know that all John Moody could see was Arlie 's beautiful nakedness and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of her as ugly and useless . As for Arlyn , if nothing ever happened to her again , this would be enough . The way he circled his arms around her , the way the dishes in the dish rack fell to the floor , the good white china in shards and neither one of them caring . She had never been kissed before ; she 'd been too busy with bedpans , morphine , the practical details of death . " This is crazy , " John Moody said , not that he intended to stop . Not that he could . Would he hold this against her , years and years later , how waylaid he 'd become ? Would he say she tricked him with a rare beauty no one had noticed before ? All Arlyn knew was that when she led him to her bedroom , he followed . It was a girl 's bedroom with lace runners on the bureaus and milk-glass lamps ; it did n't even seem to belong to her anymore . The way time was moving , so fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the leap from one world to the next , from the over and done to the what could be . Arlyn went forward into time and space ; she looped her arms around John Moody 's neck . She felt his kiss on her throat , her shoulders , her breasts . He had been lost and she had found him . He had asked for directions and she had told him which way to go . He was whispering , Thank you , as though she had given him a great gift . Perhaps she had given him exactly that : her self , her future , her fate . HE STAYED FOR THREE DAYS , THE ENTIRE TIME SPENT IN bed ; he was crazy for her , hypnotized , not wanting food or water , only her . She tasted like pears . How odd that was , that sweet green flavor , and even odder that he should notice . John did n't usually pay attention to people , but he did now . Arlie 's hands were small and beautiful and her teeth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , as he did . The sign of a walker , a doer , a person who completed tasks and never complained . She seemed neat and uncomplicated , everything he admired . He did not know her name until the first morning , did n't learn of her father 's death until the second . And then on the third morning John Moody awoke suddenly from a dream , the first dream he could remember having in many years , perhaps since he was a child . He 'd been in the house he 'd grown up in , a renowned construction his architect father had built outside New Haven that people called the Glass Slipper , for it was made out of hundreds of windows woven together with thin bands of polished steel . In his dream , John Moody was carrying a basket of pears along the hallway . Outside there was an ice storm and the glass house had become opaque . It was difficult to see where he was going at first , and then impossible . John was lost , though the floor plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father was a great believer in minimalism , known for it , lauded for his straight lines stacked one upon another , as though a building could be made purely from space and glass . John Moody looked down to see why the basket he carried had become so heavy . Everything was odd : the way his heart was pounding , the confusion he felt . Stranger still : the pears in the basket had become flat black stones . Before he could stop them the stones arose without being touched ; they hurtled up through the air as though they 'd been fired from a cannon , breaking the windows of the Glass Slipper , one after the other . Everything shattered and the sky came tumbling into the house . Cloud and bird and wind and snow . John Moody awoke in Arlyn 's arms , in a room he did not recognize . There was a white sheet over him , and his chest was constricted with fear . He had to get out . He was in the wrong place ; that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , wrong everything . Next to him , Arlie 's red hair fell across the pillow . In this light , true morning light , it was the color of the human heart , of blood . It seemed unnatural , not a color that he , who preferred muted tones , would ever be drawn to . Arlie raised herself onto one elbow . " What ? " she said sleepily . " Nothing . Go back to sleep .
