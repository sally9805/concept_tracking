Warriors : The New Prophecy #3 : Dawn By Erin Hunter HarperCollins Publishers , Inc . Erin Hunter " Spottedleaf ! " Leafpaw called into the forest . There was no reply . Desperation rose in her belly like bile . The wise medicine cat had guided her many times before in dreams ; if ever Leafpaw had needed Spottedleaf 's help , it was now . " Spottedleaf , where are you ? " she called again . The trees , heavy with leaf , did not tremble in the breeze . No prey-sound whispered in the shadows . The silence tore at Leafpaw 's heart like a claw . Suddenly an unfamiliar yowl echoed in her ears , forcing its way into her dream . Leafpaw opened her eyes with a jolt . For a moment she could n't think where she was . Her fur was ruffled by a cold draught and instead of a soft mossy nest there was strange , cold , shiny web beneath her paws . She stood up in panic and more shiny web grazed her ears . Wherever she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than her . Taking a deep breath , Leafpaw forced herself to look around , and everything came rushing back to her . She was trapped in a tiny den , with walls , floor and roof made entirely from cold hard web . There was just enough space to stand and stretch , but no more . It was packed among other dens , lining every wall of a small wooden Twoleg nest . Leafpaw longed to see the stars , to breathe in the comforting presence of StarClan and know they were watching her , but when she looked up she sawnothing but the nest 's steeply pitched roof . The only light came from a shaft of moonlight that streamed through a small hole in the wall at one end of the nest . Her den was on top of others ; the one directly below was empty but beneath that she could just make out a bundle of dark fur . Another cat ? Not a forest cat , since its scent was unfamiliar . The shape was so still , it must have been sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly . She listened again for the yowl , but the cat that had cried out was silent now and Leafpaw could only hear the soft mewling and shuffling of cats trapped in the other dens . She sniffed the air but recognized no scents . An acrid Twoleg stench filled the nest , tinged with fear . Leafpaw unsheathed her claws , feeling them catch on the shiny web . StarClan , where are you ? The thought fleetingly crossed her mind that she was already dead , but she thrust it away with a shudder that made her claws scrape against the floor of the den . " I see you 're awake at last , " whispered a voice . Leafpaw jumped and craned her neck to look over her shoulder . A heap of tabby fur stirred in the den beside hers and she smelled the unmistakeable Twoleg-tainted scent of a kittypet . There had been kindness in the she-cat 's voice but Leafpaw felt too wretched to reply . Her mind flooded with bitter memories of how the Twolegs had trapped her while she was hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been separated from her Clan and locked in darkness . Overwhelmed by despair , she buried her nose in her paws and closed her eyes . Another voice sounded from a den further along . It was too quiet to make out the words , but there was something familiar about it . Leafpaw lifted her muzzle to taste the air , but all she could smell was a sour tang that reminded her of the herbs Cinderpelt used for cleaning wounds . The voice spoke again , and Leafpaw strained her ears to listen . " We must get out of here , " the cat was mewing . Another cat answered from the far side of the nest . " How ? There 's no way out . " " We ca n't just sit here waiting to die ! " the first voice insisted . " There have been other cats here - I can smell them , and their fear-scent . I do n't know what happened to them but whatever it was must have scared their fur off . We 've got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no way out , you mouse-brain , " came a rough mew . " Shut up and let us sleep . " The words made Leafpaw feel sick with fear and sadness . She did n't want to die here , leaving nothing but a reek of fear ! She flattened her ears and closed her eyes , clawing for the safety of sleep . " Wake up ! " A voice hissed in Leafpaw 's ear , jolting her out of troubled dreams . She lifted her head and looked around . Watery sunlight filtered in through the hole in the wall , though it did nothing to lift the chill from her fur . In the weak dawn light she could see the tabby she-cat in the den next to her more clearly . It was soft and well groomed , and Leafpaw was conscious of her own matted pelt as she stared at her . She was definitely a kittypet , plump and soft-muscled beneath her tabby pelt . " Are you all right ? " asked the kittypet , her eyes wide with worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I was dreaming , " Leafpaw replied hoarsely . Her voice felt strange , as if she had n't spoken for several days , and as she spoke memories of her nightmare came flooding back : images of water - swollen rivers scarlet with blood - and great birds swooping out of the sky with thorn-sharp claws . For a heartbeat , Leafpaw saw Feathertail hidden in darkness and then swathed in starlight , and without understanding why , her paws trembled . Outside a Twoleg monster roared into wakefulness , bringing her back to the wooden nest and the den that pressed around her . " You do n't look well , " the kittypet commented . " Try eating some breakfast . There 's some in the corner of your cage . " Cage ? Leafpaw wondered at the strange word . Is that what this den is called ? The kittypet was nodding through the web that separated the two ' cages ' toward a half-empty holder of stinking pellets . Leafpaw looked at the Twoleg food in disgust . " I 'm not eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give yourself a wash , " the kittypet urged . " You 've been hunched up like a wounded mouse since the workfolk brought you here . " Leafpaw twitched her shoulders but did n't move . " They did n't hurt you when they caught you did they ? " the kittypet asked . There was concern in her voice . " No , " Leafpaw mumbled . " Then get up and wash yourself , " she went on more briskly . " You 're no use to yourself or any cat moping around like that . " Leafpaw did not want to get up and wash herself . The web floor scratched against her paws , and blood oozed from beneath one of her claws . Her eyes stung with the filthy air that filtered into the nest , fouled by the monsters outside . And StarClan had sent no comfort to ease the desperate fear that gripped her heart . Continues ... by Erin Hunter
