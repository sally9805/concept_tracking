Bargaining for Cheyenne 's Life Cheyenne Shluffmuffin lay in bed , shivering . Although the girl 's slim body quaked with cold , her thin pajamas and sheets were soaked in sweat . Her skin was so hot , it scalded the fingertips of whoever touched her . The darkened room in the attic of the odd house in the forest smelled like cherry cough syrup , menthol , and stale bedclothes . The sound of her labored , wheezing breathing was hard to listen to . The doctor removed a glass thermometer from between Cheyenne 's parched lips and held it close to the bedside light . " How high is my temperature , Doctor ? " Cheyenne asked weakly . " A hundred and six , " he said . A tortured cough momentarily convulsed her body . " That 's . . . not so high , " she gasped when she could breathe again , " is it ? " " No , " said the doctor , " not compared to the temperature of boiling water . " Wally , Cheyenne 's ten-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are doctors supposed to be sarcastic ? " he whispered . Shirley shook her head . " No , Wally , " she whispered back . " But that 's troll doctors for you -- no bedside manner . However , they do make house calls . " Shirley rubbed four of her eight legsthrough her silk pajamas and pulled her robe more tightly around herself . Even giant spiders sometimes feel a chill . " Hey , honey , a hundred and six is nothing , " said Vampire Dad , pulling the blankets up over his shivering daughter . " I once had a hundred and twenty . " This was an outrageous lie to make Cheyenne feel better and she knew it . Dad had never had a temperature higher than a hundred and four , and for the past three years he 'd had no temperature at all . The troll doctor yanked his stethoscope out of his long floppy ears and zipped up his medical bag . His wart-covered head was so large , it threatened to tip him over on his stubby legs and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley , and Shirley 's human husband , Edgar , followed the troll as he hopped down three flights of stairs to the front door . " Okay , amigos , " said the troll , " that 'll be two hundred bucks . Cash . " Dad looked at Edgar , then shrugged and raised his palms . " My word , Doctor , " said Edgar in his charming British accent . " When we spoke on the phone , I understood you to say one hundred . " " Right , " said the troll . " A hundred for the house call , a hundred for the stairs . Stairs are murder on a troll 's legs . If I 'd known you had stairs , I never would 've come . " Edgar pulled a roll of twenties , as old and limp as cloth , from his wallet . He counted out a sheaf of them and extended it to the troll , who snatched it quick as a toad 's tongue . " What is your prognosis , Doctor ? " asked Edgar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flame close to the bowl of his pipe , and inhaled deeply . It failed to light . " Well , Professor , " said the troll , " there 's a very good chance she 'll live through the night , in which case I would n't be surprised if she makes it all the way to lunch tomorrow . " " And after that ? " Wally asked . " After that ? " said the troll . " After that your guess is as good as mine . To be on the safe side , though , I 'd probably have me a good funeral home standing by . " The troll opened the front door . " Heigh-ho , " he said , and then hopped through the door and went down the walk , swinging his black bag . Wally , Edgar , Shirley , and Vampire Dad stared out the door after him , paralyzed by his dark news , until Edgar realized that leaving doors open at night in Dripping Fang Forest was unwise , and promptly slammed it shut . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total creep , " said Wally . " And I 'm sorry , I know you 're not supposed to notice trolls ' heads and legs and warts and stuff , but --  " " Wally , the fact that he 's a troll has nothing to do with his being a creep , " Dad interrupted . " He 'd be just as creepy if he were human . And I refuse to believe that Cheyenne 's chances are as bad as he said . A high fever is a good sign . A high fever shows that the body is fighting the infection . Is n't that right , Professor ? " " Quite , " said Edgar , sucking in vain on his unlit pipe . " The fever is nothing to worry about . It 's the coughing up of blood that I do n't like . Now , I 'm not a doctor , but I do think she 's going to be just fine . " " So do I , " said Vampire Dad , trying hard not to think about all that luscious blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure she drinks plenty of liquids . Then she 'll be fine . " " She 'll absolutely be fine , " said Wally . She 's going to die , said Wally silently . My poor twin sister is going to die . Oh , God , please do n't let her die . Please , please do n't let her die . If you let her live , I 'll do anything you want , anything . I 'll become a better boy , a better brother . I 'll . . . I 'll try to be more positive . Cheyenne has always wanted me to be more positive . If she pulls through this , I 'll become a total optimist , I swear , even more than Cheyenne . Much more . If you let Cheyenne live , I 'll be such an optimist , I 'll make her look like me by comparison ! " She may seem bad now , " said Dad , " but it 's always darkest before the dawn . By morning she 'll be fever free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered , can I bite her on the neck just before she utters her last gasp , before her heart contracts that final time and squeezes out her last pulse of nourishing blood , and then have her join me as a member of the living dead ? No ! I can not even think such thoughts ! I can not let her die ! I do n't know if I can believe in a God who let me drown in a Porta Potti and become a vampire , but I 'm willing to keep an open mind . Okay , God , if you do exist , and if you let her live , I 'll do anything you want me to . I 'll give up forever my infernal thirst for human blood . I 'll get over how hurt I am that she and Wally prefer to have the Spydelles be their parents instead of me . If you let her live , I 'll tell them I wo n't even stand in the way of the Spydelles legally adopting my children . " She 'll be fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can I promise you , Lord , to convince you to spare this child 's life ? Edgar prayed . I know -- if she lives , I shall tell Vampire Dad he no longer has to sleep in the garage at night ; he can come back and sleep in the house . Sure , our lives will no longer be safe from his horrid bloodlust , but I 'm willing to make that sacrifice if you will only let this poor child live . " The important thing , " said Shirley , " is to put ice packs on her and get the fever down . That 's what 's going to do the trick . She 'll be fine by morning , you mark my words . " Here 's what I 'm prepared to do if Cheyenne 's life is spared , thought Shirley . If Cheyenne lives , I 'll give up my desire to have babies of my own , and I 'll insist that the twins return to their real father , bloodsucking demon or not . The phone rang . Shirley picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shirl ? " said a breathless female voice . " It 's Hortense Jolly , at the Jolly Days Orphanage . We 're worried sick about poor little Cheyenne . How 's she doing ? Still alive ? " " Yes , Hortense , she 's still alive , " said Shirley , rolling all eight of her eyes . " What can I do for you ? " " The orphans here at Jolly Days and I are holding an all-night candlelight vigil for her , " said Hortense . " And I 've written a song especially for the occasion , which they 'd like to sing her . Is this a good time ? " " No , " said Shirley , " could n't be a worse one . " " Good , " said Hortense , " it 'll only take a minute . Could you just hold the receiver up to her ear ? " " No , Hortense . Cheyenne is in the attic . There 's no phone up there , and I 'm three flights down in the living room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to come downstairs and listen to this ? I really think she 'll get a kick out of it . " " Cheyenne is running a very high fever , " said Shirley with exaggerated slowness . " I 'm not having her get out of bed to listen to a song . " " Okay , Shirl , whatever , " said Hortense . " Here comes the song . Ready , Orphans ? A-one , a-two , a-three , and . . . " Continues ...
