Drink your cod-liver oil or the moon will eat you , my grandmother used to say . Well , I did n't drink my cod-liver oil and the moon did n't eat me . But one night I refused to drink my milk when I was visiting my grandmother , who lived in a white-frame farmhouse on the outskirts of Bloomington , and my bed , my teddy bear , and the tinker toys I 'd spilled over the quilt were all whirled away in a tornado . Neighbors found the headboard caught in a barbed-wire fence down the road , along with the bodies of thirteen sheep . <p> I was n't in the bed , thank God . I was huddling down in a corner of the cellar with my grandmother , who had pulled an old mattress over our heads . But nothing was ever the same for me after that . I 've never fallen asleep with any feeling of security since that time . Who knows where a bed might fly to in the night ? <p> My grandmother 's house was flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubble , shaken but unharmed . I followed my grandmother around , admiring her courage . She did n't cry or complain as she contemplated the wreck of her house . The men from town , bleary-eyed and no doubt thinking about their own damaged roofs or blown-out windows , offered her coffee from their thermoses , and they collected as many of her possessions as they could find and fitted a tarpaulin over them . But everything was broken  --  the dining-room table split in two , chairs reduced to kindling , dishes and glasses scattered in shining chips . Even some of the grass had been torn up by the force of the tornado , and the big elms that shaded the front porch were uprooted , two of them carried clear across the sheep pasture . <p> After the tornado , I was sent back to Peoria , and my grandmother bought a tract house in town , and lived there with her youngest daughter , my aunt Florence , who moved home to work in the admissions office of the hospital . My grandmother died five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shutting down , farms were going bankrupt , but a plant that manufactured television sets opened up , and was followed by another plant manufacturing microwaves . <p> My mother was delighted when I was admitted to the university in Bloomington . <p> " You can have Sunday dinners with Flo , " she said . <p> So one evening in September , a week after classes had started , I found myself on the plaid couch in Aunt Flo 's rancher . She brought out a bowl of cheese curls , poured me some iced tea , and sat across from me in a matching plaid rocking recliner . <p> There was a picture of my grandmother in a silver frame on the maple coffee table . I picked it up . My grandmother was wearing overalls , and she had a cane fishing pole in one hand , and a big fish she 'd just caught in the other . She was grinning widely . <p> " She was a tough old lady , " Flo said . " She lost everything in that tornado , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flo over her fried chicken and mashed potato dinner that I was looking for a part-time job , and she said she 'd ask around the hospital . A week later she called . A woman with a broken ankle , whose professor husband was off in Europe , needed someone to come over to cook her dinners . <p> " But I ca n't cook , " I said . " All I ever did at home was make the salad and set the table . " <p> " Does n't matter . She 'll tell you what to do . She 's on crutches and is having trouble getting around her kitchen . " <p> " Well , in that case , " I said . " Great . Thanks so much , Aunt Flo . " <p> The directions I got over the phone took me into the best neighborhood in Bloomington , a neighborhood called Windermere that was the equivalent of River View Drive in Peoria , where my father took us on Sunday drives to admire castles and mansions . But this neighborhood was so well-hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it existed . I walked down a winding road , lined with trees , excited by glimpses of big mansions built on the hillsides . <p> The house where Mrs. Berglund lived was a breathtaking contemporary glass house that dominated a sloped landscaped yard , fringed with forest and expansive gardens . I walked slowly up the long drive to the enormous , carved double-front doors , savoring the experience . <p> Chimes sounded somewhere deep inside when I pushed the bell button . One half of the door opened . A tall woman on crutches smiled at me . She was wearing a pink , shirred nylon blouse , and a long , silvery skirt . <p> " Hi , " she said . " You must be Edie . I 'm Sandra Berglund . " <p> Her graying blond hair was pulled back into a ponytail . Her skin was pale , faintly lined , but shining as if she 'd just rubbed it with lotion . She had a cast on one foot , partly covered by the silvery skirt , and a pair of crutches stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I followed her into a large , bright marble hallway . Before me was a glass-walled atrium where a fountain , surrounded by holly bushes , was jetting water into the air . The water fell back into a marble basin . <p> " Oh , it 's beautiful , " I exclaimed . <p> She smiled . " Come around this way . " <p> Mrs. Berglund hobbled around the atrium , the wooden tips of the crutches making a pocking sound on the marble floor of the hall , which surrounded the glass atrium on three sides . The fourth side of the atrium created an inner wall for the living room . Across an expanse of white carpet was the outer wall of glass , stretching from the floor up to the nine-foot ceiling , so that the room seemed to extend out into the gardens beyond  --  a terrace with a wrought-iron table , a sweep of grass still bright green and leafless even though it was October , and terraced hillsides set with chrysanthemums of every imaginable shade , from purple to mauve to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some coffee , " Mrs. Berglund said . " It 's in the kitchen , through there , if you 'd like to bring us both a cup . I 'll just settle here . " <p> She sat down on a piece of a white sectional sofa that I only noticed for the first time as she spoke to me . I forced myself to gaze away from the enchanting out-of-doors . I glanced quickly around the living room as I crossed it to the kitchen . It was all shades of white and beige and gold . <p> The kitchen had its own wall of glass , and sliding doors out to the terrace . Everything was built-in with an island in the middle , where a cook could stir a pot and still look out at the chrysanthemums . <p> A fancy coffee machine , called a Bunn-O-Matic , stood on the counter . The glass pot was full of fresh coffee , and I poured it into the two china cups sitting on a silver tray next to it . The tray already contained a plate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the living room and placed it carefully on the glass coffee table . Then I handed one of the china cups to Mrs. Berglund . She motioned for me to sit near her , but on another section of the sofa . <p> " Please help yourself to the madeleines , " she said , gesturing to the cookies . " A friend just sent them from France . " <p> Suddenly a flash of shadow crossed my face . I glanced up . There were glass skylights in the ceiling . Clouds crossed the blue sky . <p> " Your house is mostly glass , " I said . <p> " Yes , it 's a glass house . My husband loves it . He 's a volcanologist , and he says the views are restful . But it 's not a house for someone living alone . " <p> " What 's a volcanologist ? " <p> " He studies volcanoes  --  he 's off on an expedition in Italy right now . He 'll be gone several months . I was about to join him when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gray pearl ring hanging on a gold chain around her neck . She began to roll it idly back and forth between her fingers . <p> The cloud crossed the skylight again . " Do you have a basement ? " I asked . <p> " Just a crawl space , " she said . " Why ? " <p> " Tornadoes . " <p> She shrugged . " Do n't they usually hit out in the countryside where it 's flat ? Anyway , what are the odds ? " <p> I did n't say anything , so she reached out for one of her crutches . " Are you hungry ? How about a nice omelette for supper ? Let 's go out to the kitchen . I 'll sit on a stool and order you around . " She laughed . <p> I followed her out to the kitchen , glad she had changed the subject . I found it almost impossible to talk about the tornado that had destroyed my grandmother 's house , even though I 'd gone through therapy when I was a teenager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a thunderstorm . The therapist had explained that I was traumatized because no one had encouraged me to talk about my fears when it first happened . <p> " Tell me about the tornado , " he 'd said . He was a big man with a shock of graying hair , and square hands that he kept folded on the desk in front of him . " Did it sound like a freight train ? " <p> I shook my head . <p> " What did it sound like ? " <p> I shrugged , and shifted uncomfortably in the armchair that faced his desk . It was n't true that I 'd put the tornado into a little room inside my head , and kept the door closed , which is what he 'd told me I did . Actually the tornado had the run of my head . I never felt safe . Even sitting around the Christmas tree with my brothers and sisters , opening presents while snow fell outside the picture window , I was aware that at any moment a tornado could blow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , perhaps , but in a few months it would be March again , when the sky could darken any afternoon , so how could I allow myself to be happy and carefree when our cheerful living room might not exist next Christmas , and some or all of us might be dead ? <p> " Close your eyes , Edie , " I remember him saying . " Tell me what it sounded like . " <p> I sighed . I closed my eyes . I wanted to get the consultation over with so I could go home . <p> " It sounded like shrieking , " I said . " Shrieking and weeping . " <p> He frowned , and leaned forward . He looked concerned . " You mean , like people shrieking and weeping . " <p> I was going to tell him the truth , that yes , the tornado had sounded like many people shrieking and weeping as they were whirled around inside the funnel . Afterwards it had seemed to me that I could even pull out some individual cries from the strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my imagination or not . But something about the therapist 's attentiveness made me wary . So I only said : " No , like the wind shrieking and weeping . " <p> He sat back in his chair , reassured , pressing his fingertips together . <p> So four afternoons a week for the next few months , even after the cast came off her foot , and except for the three weeks when I went home to Peoria for Christmas , and Mrs. Berglund flew to Italy to visit her husband , I went over to the glass house at four o'clock and either cooked a simple dinner myself , or helped Mrs. Berglund to cook something more complicated . Part of the arrangement was that I ate the dinner with her , for she was lonely and hated eating by herself . We always sat in the dining room with the doors open to the atrium , where the holly trees were strung with tiny white lights , and the fountain glittered . It was like eating in fairyland , for there were tall silver candles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Berglund would drink one single glass of white wine , and we both had crystal goblets filled with fizzing mineral water that came from France . She 'd tell me all about the wonderful places in the world where she 'd traveled . She described a glacier called the Sea of Glass , and the butterflies at Iguassu Falls . <p> And of course I was delighted to get out of eating dorm food  --  increasingly hard to face on the nights when Mrs. Berglund went out to dinner , or had professional caterers over to cook elaborate meals for friends . Occasionally I had a Sunday dinner with Aunt Flo in her eat-in kitchen , and tried to focus on her cheerful kindness , rather than let myself feel depressed by her salt-shaker collection , her ruffled pink cafe curtains , her plastic placemats printed with photographs of lighthouses ( she always asked me to choose the lighthouse I liked best ) , and her tuna noodle casserole or meatloaf . <p> Then one day in early March , a warm front moved in from the Gulf , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading down from Canada , and even though the weathermen were only talking about a chance of thunderstorms , I knew it was tornado weather . <p> I usually set off for Mrs. Berglund 's house around three o'clock , after my biology class , but that day I was tempted to call her up and tell her I was n't feeling well . But then what would I do ? Cower in the dorm basement under the steam pipes when I could be listening to tales of the Great Barrier Reef or the fjords in Norway while dining by candlelight ? <p> Mrs. Berglund always drove me back to the dorm after dinner in her Mercedes . The storm might not hit until late in the evening , so I decided to risk going to her house as usual , and try to act like a normal student , like all the other thousands of normal , carefree students crossing the warm , windy campus at that moment , glad to be free of winter coats , heading for classes or the library or jobs in flimsy fast-food restaurants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treetops . The raked winter lawns of Windermere already had a faint green sheen , and the maple buds seemed to be reddening the branches . My hair tangled behind my shoulders , and I unzipped my jacket as I walked up the hill . <p> Mrs. Berglund had slid open one of the sliding doors to the backyard , and gusty air blew through the house . She was wearing a filmy sleeveless dress that fluttered around her ankles . <p> " Does n't it smell wonderful , " she said . " Spring at last . " <p> " Tornado weather , " I said . <p> " Oh , Edie . You worry about everything . Let 's just enjoy it . I 'd love to eat outside , but the wind would blow everything off the table . " <p> We started to make a quiche and a salad . I tried not to jump at the sound of branches knocking against the roof . Then a whirlwind of dead leaves blew noisily across the yard , and I dropped the lettuce spinner . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Berglund said . " When I pulled back the curtains , she was in the yard , looking right at me . But her whole body was quivering with fear , and when I moved , she turned so fast I only glimpsed her white tail disappearing . " <p> While I rolled out the dough for the quiche , Mrs. Berglund went into the study to catch the nightly news on the TV . She came back in a few minutes . <p> " There 's a tornado watch , " she said . " But it 's just a watch . Conditions are favorable . " <p> " I know that , " I said . " It 's getting dark out there . " <p> " That 's just twilight coming on . " <p> " Are n't you afraid of anything ? " I asked . <p> She laughed . " I 'm afraid of being by myself . What else is there to be afraid of ? Death ? That 's nothing . " She held out the gray pearl ring that she always wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes tucked into her clothes . " Here . Give this a rub . It 's my magic ring . It belonged to Carl 's **29;1300;TOOLONG . " <p> She let the ring fall into my palm . It was a twisted band of gold , designed to look like a vine , set with a single , grayish-blue pearl . <p> " It 's beautiful . Why do n't you wear it like a ring ? " <p> " Look at my knuckles . Arthritis , that 's why . " <p> I rubbed the top of the pearl . " Were n't you afraid when you climbed the volcano at Christmas ? " <p> " Well , " she said , tucking the chain with the ring back inside her neckline . " Once a big , red hot boulder shot out from the rim and started rolling toward us . Naturally I was scared , and I turned around to run . But Carl and the other scientists stopped me . They said we had to face it , because we had to see which way it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run , it might have caught up with us . " <p> " You ca n't do that with a tornado , " I said . <p> She laughed . " Have you ever actually seen one , Edie ? " She took the rolling pin out of my hand and dipped it into the flour . The dough had gotten sticky on me , and I was starting to make a mess . <p> I took a deep breath , facing away from her . I could see the kitchen reflected now on the glass sliding doors . The figures of two women wavered dimly , as if underwater . The wind was picking up outside . " Yes , " I said finally . " I was in a house that was destroyed by a tornado about five miles from here . " <p> " Oh , God . I did n't know that . No wonder you 're scared . " Mrs. Berglund came around and gave me a quick hug , leaving floury prints on my shoulder . " And you 're worried because this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something better than a basement , believe it or not . " <p> " What ? " I asked . <p> " A bomb shelter . An old-fashioned 1950's-style bomb shelter . Carl insisted on having one dug when we bought this house . We lived in Geneva once , and all the houses in Switzerland have bomb shelters . " <p> Just then the lights flickered . <p> " Shit , " Mrs. Berglund said . " This quiche may never get baked . " <p> The wind screamed , and I thought I heard wailing . " Listen , " I said . I ran over to the glass door and slid it open a crack . Over the howl of the wind I could hear the wavering pitch of a tornado siren . <p> The lights went out . I sucked in my breath and slammed the door shut , but in a second Mrs. Berglund had a flashlight in her hand and was illuminating the kitchen . <p> " Grab the salad , Edie , and those plates and forks over there . Okay , this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My hands were shaking , but I followed her calm orders . I saw her shadowy figure reach into the refrigerator for a bottle of wine , then we were heading down the hall . She opened a door , and to my great relief I saw a stairway in the dancing glow of her flashlight . She made me go first , and kept the stairs bright so I could see my way down . <p> The room was a small , carpeted cube , completely empty except for a few cardboard boxes . Mrs. Berglund set the flashlight on top of one of the boxes . I placed the salad and plates on the floor . <p> " I 'll go back for wineglasses , " she said . <p> " No , do n't ! " My voice sounded strained even to my own ears . <p> " And we need the radio down here . What 's the good of a bomb shelter without a radio and wineglasses ? " <p> I could hear her groping her way back up the stairs in the dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly against my chest to try to stop my trembling . I remembered the soapy smell of my grandmother 's skin as she held me under the mattress all those years ago , telling me to keep my head in her lap in case the shelves of canned goods in their glass jars got knocked down . Then the shrieking began . It seemed to me that the tornado had already been full of cows and sheep and children and grandmothers , all swirling around in the black funnel and crying for help as it bore down on our house , but maybe what I heard was only the sound of our own shrieks of terror , my grandmother holding my face tight against her as the glass jars broke in counterpoint to the crash of the walls above us exploding outward . <p> A light flashed at the head of the stairs . Mrs. Berglund came back down with a second flashlight tucked under her arm , two wineglasses , a loaf of French bread , and a small radio . <p> " It 's wild out there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , Edie . You look like a ghost . " <p> She handed me a glass of white wine . I never drank alcohol , so the first mouthful seemed to run through my veins like electricity . <p> Mrs. Berglund settled against the wall next to me and switched on the radio . The campus station had interrupted programming , and the announcer was talking about a tornado that had touched down in Ellettsville . But the sighting had n't been confirmed by the sheriff 's office . Nevertheless a warning was in effect until eight p.m . <p> " Let 's switch it off until eight , then , " Mrs. Berglund said . " Is that doing you any good ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . I 'd finished my glass quickly . She poured me another , but she was still sipping her usual single glass . I did feel calmer . I looked at her more closely . " You 've never told me where you and Carl met . Did you fall in love right away ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saved my life . I fell off a slippery pier on a lake in Italy on a stormy day , and Carl , who was in line for the ferry , too , jumped in and rescued me . It turned out that he was going to be doing research in the U.S. the next year , so it was easy to get together again . Losing him is the only thing I really fear  --  but I 'm not a scientist , so I ca n't follow him around everywhere he goes , though sometimes I try . I know he 's smart and careful . " She sighed . She took out her ring and began to turn it over in her fingers . " Actually , dear , I 'm terrified that a volcano will erupt while he 's up there . But there 's nothing I can do about it . " <p> We ate our salads with the flashlights focused on our plates , our heads in shadow . Mrs. Berglund tore off a piece of bread from the long loaf , then handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said dreamily . I had never been drunk before in my whole life , and I felt as if I were hovering a little ways above my body , watching myself from a distance . <p> " Lacrimae Christi  --  the grapes are grown on the slopes of Vesuvius . It 's Carl 's favorite . A **29;1331;TOOLONG of his once climbed Vesuvius in the nineteenth-century , and did some sketches . " She lifted her ring . " This was the wedding ring he had made  --  it looks like a pearl , but it 's really polished lava . " <p> " There 's a sketch of a volcano on your living-room wall , " I said . <p> " That 's one of his sketches . We used to have several , but Carl 's son took the others . " <p> " He has a son ? " <p> " From an earlier marriage . A fussy little asshole . I ca n't stand him . " <p> The recessed lighting overhead flashed in our eyes . We both blinked and looked around like startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tornado watch had been canceled for our area . The cold front had moved through much more quickly than expected . <p> We went upstairs . I looked out the sliding glass door again . It was windy , and ragged clouds raced across the sky . Mrs. Berglund cut me a piece of cake , made us coffee , then drove me back to the dorm , where I lay down with a spinning head and dry mouth to suffer the first , though not the last , hangover of my life . <p> Mrs. Berglund could hardly speak when she called me two months later to tell me that she 'd just had some terrible news . Carl had been killed in a car accident in Italy . <p> I was standing at a bank of phones just off the main lounge of the dorm , and all around me girls were talking to their boyfriends or gossiping with other girls about boys they wanted for boyfriends . I kept saying , " Oh , no , oh , no , " and " That 's terrible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the girls on the other phones were glancing at me with pity , and hastily ending their own phone calls . <p> Mrs. Berglund was leaving for the airport that evening . She wanted to see me briefly before she left . She must have been watching for me , for the door opened before I 'd even pushed the bell button . I 'd never seen her in anything but long flowing skirts and dresses , so it was almost a shock to see her in a short green suit , wearing nylons and high heels , her knees and calves and ankles visible , as if she were an ordinary human being . Her face seemed to have crumpled in on itself , and the skin below her eyes was red and swollen . <p> We hugged each other . " I must have turned my back on that boulder , " she said , her voice rough . " Because I did n't see this coming . " <p> " How could you , " I said . <p> " I worried about lava the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have worried about speeding . " <p> " Was he speeding ? " <p> " Somebody 's always speeding . " She sighed , reaching into her suit pocket . " Anyway , I wanted to give this to you . I want to make sure that fussy little asshole of a son of his never gets his hands on it , not even after I 'm dead . " <p> She handed me the antique lava ring . " Here , Edie . If I had a daughter , I would give it to her . So you wear this , and whenever you 're afraid , just rub the stone . " <p> I looked at the ring in my palm . " Oh , it 's so beautiful . But I could n't take something this valuable . " <p> " Who knows whether it 's valuable or not ? It would only be valuable if you sold it . If you wear it , then it 's just a gift from a friend . " She closed my palm over the ring . " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're afraid of something , and miss it ? " I asked . <p> " There 's nothing left for me to be afraid of , " she said . <p> I nodded . I slid the ring onto my finger . <p> " My taxi will be here any minute . Let me get my purse and lock up . " <p> She disappeared into her bedroom . I stood looking out the glass wall at a small flowering pear tree . The grass was bright chartreuse , and birds were flying back and forth . Tulips of every shade and shape , from red to deep purple to yellow , some ruffled and doubled like roses , glowed around the edge of the terrace . One chair was pulled out from the wrought-iron table , as if someone had been sitting there enjoying the sunshine and had just that minute gotten up to go inside and answer the phone . <p> I was n't inside the house in Windermere again for twenty years . But last year when I accepted a job in the geology department of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate agent looking at houses . <p> Nothing pleased me . The old houses close to campus had wet basements and no yards to speak of , and the seventies houses farther away had low ceilings and few windows . The newer houses in the far suburbs had lofted ceilings , but the doors were made of plastic . <p> " There 's an interesting house in Windermere , " the real estate agent said . " It 's been on the market for a while . " <p> I recognized the glass house from the bottom of the curving driveway , and drew my breath in sharply . The grass in front was long and weedy , and the bushes looked half-dead . <p> Karen , my agent , got the key from the lockbox . We went inside . <p> It was cold . The heat was n't turned on , and an April chill had invaded the empty rooms . The fountain was missing from the atrium , and the holly bushes looked like they needed watering . The glass wall to the terrace was spotted with rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and someone with bad taste had laid bright shag carpeting in the dining room . <p> " This house is always changing hands , " Karen said , brushing back her blond bangs from her blue eyes as she shrewdly noted the look of dismay on my face . " It 's all electric , and costs a fortune to heat . " <p> I looked out at the weedy terrace . I had never seen Mrs. Berglund again after I waved to her in the taxi that day . She never wrote to me , and in the fall , when I came back to school , the first thing I did was walk to Windermere . But the house was for sale . I knocked , but no one answered . The geology department in which Carl taught when he was n't doing fieldwork gave me an address in Rome , so I wrote to Mrs. Berglund again . Still no answer . And gradually I threw myself into my classes , and learned to tolerate the bland food dished up on thick cafeteria china . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players horsing around , and the blare of the banked TV sets overhead got too much for me , I 'd look at my ring and remember another world . <p> <p> By Maura Stanton <p>
