PEOPLE afflicted with it commonly downplay this disease as simply a " littie touch of sugar . " But anyone who knows the truth about diabetes understands that it is much more serious than that . A potentially debilitating disease , diabetes affects more than 16 million Americans ( including more than 3 million Blacks ) , and kills more than 182,000 Americans each year . The seventh-leading killer in the United States , diabetes is the No. 1 disease causing blindness , kidney ailment and nontraumatic amputations in Blacks , and it is America ' ' @ second most-costly disease , behind mental disor ders . One in four Black women over 55 and one i four Black men between 65 and 74 are affected . But while diabetes is prevalent and serious , Dr. James R. Gavin III , chair the African American Program of the American Diabetes Association , say it is also one of the most preventable and manageable chronic diseases . " There is a peril among u ! that seeks to find us , to impoverish us , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat it , and we can . And we ca n't say that about a lot of perils among us . It begins with awareness and good information . You ca n't go into battle without some knowledge of the enemy . " Diabetes is defined as the body 's inability to produce or respond to insulin , a hormone that allows blood glucose ( blood sugar ) to enter the cells of the body and produce energy . There are two major types of **25;855;TOOLONG , also known as type I diabetes , and noninsulin dependent , also known as type II diabetes . Type II is the most common in adults . African-Americans over 45 , persons overweight , and those who have a family history of the disease are most at risk . Doctors and scientists have not been able to fully explain why Blacks are affected at a higher rate than other races , although they believe factors such as heredity , diet and increased incidences of high blood pressure play a part . Diabetes has no cure . The disease is detected through a simple blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older be tested for diabetes every three years . For Blacks , it is suggested that testing begin earlier and be given more frequently . Warning signs include excessive thirst , frequent urination , extreme hunger and irritability , unexplained weight loss , tingling in fingers and/or toes , nausea , fatigue and vomiting . Diabetics can reduce the debilitating effects of the disease by eating a low-fat diet , exercising regularly , taking prescribed medication and visiting the doctor regularly . Unlike most other diseases , the person affected with diabetes does most of the care . A good diet , one that consists of many green vegetables , grains and fruits , keeps the rise of the blood glucose level to a minimum and complex carbohydrates at a high level . Regular exercise also helps to lower the glucose level in the blood . Ideally , people with diabetes should exercise three or four times a week for at least 20 minutes each time . In addition , medication , which consists of pills or insulin shots , is another weapon that is helpfulin the fight against diabetes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regular visits to the doctor are important because a di &; betic 's blood glucose level , diet , weight and blood pressure should be examined by a professional . Photograph Regular consultations with health-care professionals can help diabetics get answers to questions concerning medication , diet and exercise . // Gavin says early intervention is the key to controlling the disease , and people who do best with diabetes are those who successfully adapt their lifestyle . To raise awareness , the ADA 's African American Program blends community outreach , such as neighborhood diabetes support groups , with coalition-building , such as signature drives aimed at showing Congress that more needs to be done in the area of diabetes research and treatment . Entertainer Gladys Knight is also very active with the American Diabetes Association . She helped to establish the Elizabeth Knight Fund , named in memory of her mother who died from complications brought on by diabetes . Through an annual benefit concert given by Knight , the fund has helped raise more than $500,000 for research , community programs , and lobbying efforts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been public awareness strategies , such as " Diabetes Sunday , " a church-based initiative in which pastors across the country set aside time to discuss the risk factors that are associated with the disease . The Rev. Floyd Flake , pastor of Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica , N.Y. , says that because the Black Church has historically served as a trusted voice and source of information in the Black community , it only makes sense that churches would also tackle health problem like diabetes . " When we were asked as a congregation if we wanted to be involved in the Diabetes Sunday program , we felt it imperative as a major church in the city of New York to make the statement that we are concerned about people 's spiritual life , but we are also concerned about their physical life , " he says . " And if that statement is made from a church in New York , I think that it sends a message to the rest of the nation that this is an important issue and that other churches need to get involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. John 's Baptist Church in Harlem , agrees , " The Black Church has been , from its very inception , the headquarters , the life center for the Black community , " he says . " it is the largest gathering place for Black people . It is a given center for the dissemination of information as well as the education of not only the congregation but the community at-large . " Photograph Diabetes support groups are sprouting tip all over the country Mary Ball , president of a support group with nearly 100 members who meet regularly at Howard University in Washington , D.C. , leads discussions aimed at helping diabetics cope with the potentially deadly disease . // Sullivan Robinson , executive director of the Congress of National Black Churches , says many pastors have taken creative approaches , including organizing educational forums and providing one-on-one counseling to parishioners who already suffer from diabetes . " We think that Diabetes Sunday is especially important , " she says . " We are encouraging all of our members to participate . We want our people to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper medical care . We have the trust and the personal contact to be able to speak very frankly about health and wellness issues that hit us with such devastating impact . " Slowly , more and more Blacks are becoming combat-ready in the fight against diabetes , realizing that the enemy is more than just a " little touch of sugar .
