1 My potential client was a Ms. Claudia Lester . Sensing she 'd prefer to meet in a grander setting , I scheduled the meeting for our conference room , as the size of my office precludes room for visitors ' seating other than in my lap . Not a propitious arrangement for a first meeting , as the conference room is part of the firm 's executive suite . What is also unfortunate is that the suite comprises the CEO 's office , the executive loo and , last but far from least , the domain of our formidable executive secretary , Mrs. Trelawney , with whom I have a love/hate relationship . I love to sass her and hate it when she gets the better of me . Raising her head of gray polyester , she scrutinized me from top to bottom and judged my attire-cord jacket over a pink button-down shirt , navy blue flares and penny loafers-as " Not bad . " " You utter a litotes , Mrs. Trelawney . " " A who ? " " Litotes , dear lady . Citing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive . You did n't say , ' You look good . ' You said , ' You do n't look bad . ' An ambiguous compliment , to say the least . " " Perhaps , Archy , it appeared ambiguous because it was n't meant to be a compliment-and you 're late . You booked the conference room for eleven and it is now . . . " " Just eleven , I believe . " She gazed askance at her lapel watch ( yes , she really wears one ) and answered , " Five past , according to Eastern Standard Time . Ms. Lester has been here since five to eleven . " " Did you offer her coffee ? " " Of course . But she refused . " " What does she look like ? " I inquired . Thinking a moment , Mrs. Trelawney answered , " Not bad for a woman her age . " " And what age might that be ? " " Somewhere between forty and death . " With that I opened the door and entered the conference room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would record in my journal as . . . No , I do n't want to give away too much too soon . That 's as bad as giving away too little too late . I will strike a happy medium and tell it like it happened . Enter Archy . " Sorry I 'm late , Ms. Lester . I would blame it on the traffic , but there was n't any to speak of . " " Then let 's blame it on me for being early . How do you do , Mr. McNally . " Claudia Lester was a blue-eyed blonde with a great tan , red lips and a smile as big as the rock she wore on the middle finger of her left hand . I was not yet ready to swear to the authenticity of either . Being of a kinder disposition than our CEO 's girl Friday , I would place her age at anywhere between forty and fifty , with a face that had had a little work , as they say , and a figure that did n't need any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print blouse I would attribute to Herms and black-and-white spectators that were a pleasing addendum to a great pair of gams . I have long been of the opinion that women dress for the occasion in the same manner theatrical designers dress a star to complement the scene . A date with a potential lover : something girly , frilly and revealing . A date with a female acquaintance : pantsuit . Business meeting : Claudia Lester was textbook perfect . " Can I offer you a cup of coffee , Ms. Lester ? " I asked as I took the chair at the head of the polished mahogany table . Ms. Lester was seated at my immediate left . " Your secretary already asked , thank you , but I 've had my morning intake and shun elevenses . " As she obviously wanted to get down to business ASAP , I did not bother to correct her misapprehension regarding the relationship between Ms. Trelawney and me . Believing that I employed a secretary who wore a lapel watch could only enhance my reputation , at least in the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business might be , I opened the interview with my standard question : " May I know who recommended you to McNally and Son , Ms. Lester ? " This is usually met with a blush and a hush or a " I 'd rather not say , as it was given in . . . er . . . confidence . " Not Ms. Lester . " Deci Fortesque , " she replied . She spoke the name in the manner of a teacher calling on an inattentive student . " Do you know him ? " I did n't know him , but I certainly knew of him . In a town rife with rich eccentrics , Decimus Fortesque was , if not the richest , surely the most eccentric of the lot . Decimus was a self-proclaimed " renowned collector , " though to the best of my knowledge his most acclaimed collection was a series of ex-wives . Eight , give or take a few . For all I knew , Ms. Lester was a former Mrs. Fortesque . Decimus had boasted , at various times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the original cross and a life preserver from Noah 's Ark . Fortesque is an old English name , but I do not believe Decimus 's branch of the family arrived on the Mayflower . More likely they were sent over as part of the Industrial Revolution . Moneywise , this had it all over the seafarers who docked on Plymouth Rock . Where the Fortesque money came from is , like all old money in this country , unimportant ; what mattered was that there was a lot of it . Where the name Decimus came from is another mystery . I doubt he was the tenth child , because the rich believe in zero population growth , giving each succeeding generation a larger slice of the pie . I had never been employed by the man , but word of mouth in Palm Beach is the most accepted form of advertising . I can tell you without false modesty that the name Archy McNally has been known to be recommended over many a damask tablecloth , both in and out of confidence . Playing it safe , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled that big , red smile and nodded to say she understood my caution . I got the pleasant feeling that Ms. Lester understood many things , especially how to please a man . I do n't mean to imply that she was a professional in the worst sense of that often misused word , but one trained as a hostess-in the best possible sense of that often misused word . I could see her making weary businessmen comfy on cross-country flights , cruise ships , pricey restaurants and the V.I.P. lounge of those places that feature V.I.P. lounges . " I am a friend of the former Mrs. Fortesque . Number three , I believe , if that does n't date me , " she said . I came back with the trite , " Who 's counting ? " and got a shrug for my trouble . " Vera , the former Mrs. Fortesque , and I worked together in the days when Pan Am circled the globe . We always managed to pull those New York-to-Sydney thirty-hour shifts . " Score one for Archy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in a rather awkward position , if that 's the correct word . " " It 's as good as any , Ms. Lester , and it 's the word most often used to describe the position of those who seek my help . " I got the smile and , " I like your honesty , Mr. McNally . " " And I appreciate honesty in those I represent . Anything less , and I will refuse your patronage . " " Fair enough . " She opened her purse-black , shoulder strap , fine leather , I believe it was Tod's-and extracted a pack of Marlboro 100s with a filter tip . " Do you mind , Mr. McNally ? " " Not at all . " I went to a sideboard that contained the standard conference-room supplies and returned with an ashtray . " Would you care for one ? " she offered as I again took my place at the table . I had enjoyed an English Oval , the only brand I smoke , on my ride from home to office . I would indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before bed . At the end of the month I would eliminate one , my choice of which one , and eliminate one on each succeeding month until I was cured of the habit . This routine was the latest in a series of withdrawal attempts and one sworn to by ex-smokers-as were all the others . " No , thank you . I 'm withdrawing , " I said . She lit the cigarette with a match , not a Dunhill , which I considered a smart move , as too many labels gives the impression that one is hell-bent on impressing , and immediately turned the white filter red . The opening line of one of my favorite ballads , as rendered by Chris Conner , played itself in my head : " A cigarette that bears your lipstick traces . . . " And owing to Ms. Lester 's former career , the next line followed quite naturally : " An airline ticket to romantic places . . . " " Cold turkey ? " she wondered aloud . " No . Gradual , " I answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after each meal and bedtime , " I told her . Inhaling deeply and directing the exhale toward the ceiling , she said , " Ah , yes , that was my favorite . And it did work . I was smoke-free for almost six months , and then along came Matthew . " " Is Matthew a heavy smoker ? " " No , Mr. McNally . Matthew is a bastard . " So we had finally reached the business end of our meeting , and his name was Matthew . The job description of a PI , especially a discreet one , is very similar to that of a psychiatrist . First we listen attentively to the client 's complaint , then we go to work on finding a cure . We prescribe aspirin , a good , stiff drink , long sea voyages and , on occasion , relocating to Brazil . The human condition being what it is , their afflictions are monotonously similar , only the names are different . " Matthew began life as Levi , a tax collector who followed Jesus , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It never hurts to let ' em know how clever you are . " This Matthew is an extortionist who wants to write a book based on my diary , " Claudia told me . Her story unfolded amid clouds of smoke . Claudia Lester had kept a diary from the day she lost her virginity to the captain of her high school basketball team to the day she found contentment as a middle-aged inhabitant of New York 's Sutton Place , and all the stops along the way . She subsisted on an income derived from the estate of her late husband , who had popped the question as they soared thirty thousand feet over the Pacific . " A very detailed diary , Mr. McNally . " Puff . Puff . " And why not ? " she challenged before I had a chance to ask why . It seems Claudia Lester enjoyed penning her memoirs as she lived them , and judging from her unabashed account of her prose I would guess that her escapades read like a modern-day Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure-known to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was attractive and ambitious . I was even offered a screen test by a producer whose name is legend in the industry , but turned him down on the grounds that acting was too much like work . The role in this costume epic went to a French gal who competed with the Sphinx for attention , and lost . " Having spent more time in the Museum of Modern Art 's cinema in New York than in any lecture hall in New Haven , I immediately knew the name of the producer , the actress and the film . If Ms. Lester was as cryptic in concealing names in her diary as in this telling , woe be unto the men in her life . She had been intimate with Hollywood producers , politicos and Fortune 500 Chairmen of the Board , one of whom she married . " He was a grandfather at the time , " she admitted . " Our marriage was brief , but intense , if you know what I mean . " So intense she probably loved the old geezer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton Place matron who lunched . Lest I think her needle had got stuck in a groove , she said , " It was n't all about sex , Mr. McNally . In my time I was also privy to business deals that were not quite kosher , dirty political campaigns , the sleeping arrangements aboard a Greek shipping magnate 's yacht and the beard for a five-star general who was getting it on with his aide-de-camp . " Well ! When it came to the prurient arts , Ms. Lester was a Black Belt . I had asked for honesty , and for that was not to be spared verse nor chapter of her life as a jet-setter . As any analyst licensed to probe would do , I questioned the lady 's motive in keeping an account of such goings-on . Blackmail came to mind , and were that the case I would soon learn that the intent had had a boomerang effect . It was Ms. Lester who was being blackmailed . I watched this curvaceous blonde stub out her cigarette and utter the name Matthew as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygen . " We met at one of those New York parties frequented by rich , middle-aged widows and attractive young men . " " They have their counterpart in Palm Beach , " I informed Ms. Lester . With a toss of her head that said either she knew this or could n't care less , she continued , " We hit it off , Matthew and I. You might say we went together like Stoli and caviar . Believe me , I had no illusions about our relationship . There had been other Matthews in my life , but none more endearing or lasting as with Matthew Harrigan . If you 're thinking H-A-double R-I-G-A-N spells Harrigan , go right ahead . " I must say the lady had a sense of humor . I do n't usually get comic relief during an initial interview . " I provided entre to the better restaurants and the crowd that frequents them , good theater seats and the occasional hundred-dollar bill for cab fare home . Matthew was handsome , witty , young and energetic , thereby providing value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew to read my diary . It amused me and inspired him . It was his idea to turn it into a book with no holds barred . I went along with him because it was fun to plot our best-seller and , as you insist on honesty , because it kept him interested in me . " When Claudia realized that Matthew was serious , boldly refusing to abandon the project when she insisted he do so , she flatly refused to continue the ruse and sent Matthew packing . " I still see many of the old crowd and enjoy all the perks of that privileged world . I had to choose between courting their wrath or dumping Matthew , and poor Matthew came in a distant second . " Forgetting I had given him a key to my apartment and the fact that the doorman knew him as a frequent caller , he paid me a final visit when I was out and took the diary . " " Breaking and entering is a felony , " I said . " He did n't exactly break the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . Two days later , I received a call from him . He was here , in Florida , and ready to return my property for fifty thousand dollars . " " Why did he come here ? " I asked . " I have no idea , but a guess would be that it added drama to the intrigue and made it very inconvenient for me . That 's when I talked to Vera , and she suggested that I speak to Deci , as I 'm a stranger in your paradise . Deci has remained on friendly terms with all his wives , you know . " Alimony being the chain that binds , I thought , then said , " Blackmail is also a felony . " " What these things are called , Mr. McNally , does not interest me . Getting back what is mine does . " " And just how do you intend to do that ? " I asked . " Pay him , of course . And that 's where you come in . He 's staying in a motel not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at nine this evening . " " And I 'm to be the courier , " I stated . " That is why I 'm here , Mr. McNally . " " He 's had more than enough time to make a copy , you know . The fifty thousand could be only a down payment , " I reminded her . " I know that , but it 's a chance I must take . However , I do n't believe Matthew would have the nerve to double-cross me . He knows the people who owe me favors . " I was looking for a reason to bow out of this deal , and she had just provided it . " Then why do n't you call in your mark and have them take care of Matthew ? " " I do n't want them to know the diary is gone missing . In fact , I do n't want them to know the diary exists , " she explained . " I know making Matthew privy to the diary jeopardized my position , but prudence is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why do n't you deliver the ransom and pick up your diary ? " " I do n't want to see him , " she said , seemingly annoyed at the questions . " More important , I want him to know he is no longer dealing with only me . He has a vivid imagination and will take the money and run . " Remembering I had no place to run , I said , " Get yourself another messenger boy , Ms. Lester . This one is not interested in the assignment . " She started as if my words were a blow to her jaw , not her ego . " Why , may I ask ? " " Because I refuse to take part in a blackmail scam and because I do n't intend to be a target for the people who owe you favors , " I answered . " As the Bard said , Mr. McNally , what 's in a name ? This thing you insist on calling blackmail can also be construed as a business deal between consenting adults . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . I deceived him , you see , taking up his time and , if you 'll excuse the analogy , his energy . I owe him something . " " Fifty thousand bucks is a lot of something , " I noted . " I can afford it . As for my friends , let 's say I was exaggerating a wee bit . After tonight I 'll forget we ever met . " " I 'm ready to forget that right now , Ms. Lester . " My hand lay on the table , and she covered it with hers . The flesh was warm , the gesture seductively reassuring . She obviously had n't lost the touch . " I 'm at the Ambassador , " she said . Before I could repeat my resolve not to take the assignment , she put a finger to my lips . " Do n't say no . Think about it . Seven this evening , if you agree . " From McNally 's Alibi by Lawrence Sanders with Vincent Lardo ( c ) July 2002 , Putnam Pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
