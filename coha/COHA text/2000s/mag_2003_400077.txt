( , a group of intelligence analysts gathered in the Defense Intelligence Agency 's " Green Room , " just outside of Washington , D.C. , to puzzle over a strange spy satellite image . It showed a gigantic machine , something bigger than any known airplane , with wings that looked too short to fly , sitting in a fenced enclosure at Kaspisk , a small city by the Caspian Sea . " Jeez , that 's a monster , " said an Army colonel . " Yeah , " said another , " the Loch Ness Monster . " Someone added : " No , the Caspian . It 's the Caspian Monster . " But what was it ? How did it work ? What did the Russians plan to do with it ? The answers came slowly over the next decade : It was an ekranoplan , a new type of aircraft that exploited an aerodynamic phenomenon called ground effect to haul enormous payloads at high speeds over water . It was invented by Rostislav Alexeyev , a friend of Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Amerikanski spies could think of a practical use for it , the Soviet military would have appreciated their advice , because Moscow politicians , keen to find a need for a project that owed its existence as much to connections as to any operational requirement , were hell-bent on ramming it down the armed services ' throats . After the Cold War ended , I asked a Russian aerospace engineer what he thought of the Monster and its descendants , which were being examined intensely by the Pentagon at the time . " A waste of money , " he grumbled . " Every time it did n't work , the designers told Moscow it would work if it was bigger . And they got the money for it . " But they may have been on the right track . Today , engineers at Boeing are designing a cargo plane that , like the Caspian Monster , is designed to skim just above the water like a large sea bird . It 's dubbed the Pelican , because it will use the same " wing-in-ground effect , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost effortlessly above the water . When applied to man-made flying vehicles , WIG aerodynamics represent a critical exception to a long-held rule of aviation  --  altitude equals efficiency . The reason most long-range airplanes are high-altitude jets is that flying in thick air at lower altitudes normally takes significantly more fuel . But if you get extremely close to the surface  --  around 50 feet or below , as a WIG vehicle would  --  a cushion of air generated by the plane 's velocity helps support it in flight , so that the plane cruises even more efficiently than a high-altitude jet . The WIG aircraft Boeing is developing is bigger than the Caspian Monster : Its wingspan is about the width of the front of the Capitol . Boeing engineers are counting on the notion that enormous wings will provide more opportunity for the air below them to gently lift and propel the vehicle , allowing it to skate a mere 20 feet off the water at 300 mph . The idea of an airplane that weighs as much as seven fully loaded Boeing 747s , and that doubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface like a waterbug , may seem far-fetched . But the engineers at Phantom Works , the secretive Boeing think tank , have begun designing this enormous machine because the Pentagon has a major problem that has defeated many less harebrained efforts over the past 40 years . That problem ? Mobility . The U.S. Army is a powerful force , but it is too large and has too much heavy equipment to move at a pace suitable for a fast-expanding conflict . For hauling the Army 's equipment , ships are slow and airplanes are small  --  one division may have more than 300 70-ton Abrams tanks . Even the huge C-5 Galaxy cargo airplane can carry only two Abramses , and the entire Air Force has 126 C-5 's . Defense transformation is eventually supposed to result in a smaller , nimbler Army . But the Pentagon 's goal is to move that force faster than it can today , putting a full brigade  --  3,000 people and 8,000 tons of equipment  --  on the ground anywhere in the world within 96 hours . John Skorupa , a retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boeing 's Advanced Airlift and Tankers division , dealt with this challenge in his previous job as commander of Air Mobility Command 's Battle Lab . " It was clear to us that we never had enough airlift . When we looked at global reach lay-down "  --  airlifters ' jargon for putting forces on the ground  --  " the airbridge took an enormous number of sorties to move a force of any significance . " In early 2000 , Skorupa , by then at Boeing , took the matter to Blaine Rawdon , a veteran Phantom Works designer who began focusing on the problem with engineer Zachary Hoisington . They knew that the Army was considering airships and airship-airplane hybrids designed to carry multimillion-pound payloads . Rawdon broadened Skorupa 's question and looked at a wide range of solutions to the Army 's problem , from a new generation of faster small commercial ships to airships to a large , conventional jet airplane , like a quadruple-size C-5 . The value of speed always caused airplanes to come out ahead of airships and even the fastest marine vessels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would likely cost more than even the Pentagon can afford . But ekranoplans , a specific type of WIG with short wings and jet boost for takeoff , seemed to offer some potential  --  as well as dramatically lower costs , if the concept could be made feasible . WIG aircraft had attracted an enormous amount of U.S. interest after the breakup of the Soviet Union , and in 1993 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency looked into what the Russians had done . Boeing 's studies confirmed DARPA 's conclusion , as well as that of several Russians , that only a very large ekranoplan made sense , but also that the Soviet vehicle that came close had several inherent problems , mostly relating to its enormous weight . The 500-ton prototype , KM , completed in 1966 , had 10 jet engines , two in the tail and eight attached to the forward wing . The 10 engines gulped fuel , and the aircraft had to reach 210 mph before it lifted off the water . The reinforced hull  --  necessary to withstand the pounding of the waves  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses , the Russian achievements were impressive , according to former DIA analyst Stephan Hooker , who was one of the people in the Green Room on that day in 1967 . The plane had less drag than an airplane of the same size , and the Russians had solved many stability and control issues . But the Soviet Navy 's commanders were never enthusiastic about the program . Though the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau , which constructed the prototype , built two more large ekranoplans  --  a 140-ton amphibious landing craft and a 400-ton vehicle armed with six anti-ship missiles  --  the Navy was already building large hovercraft for amphibious assaults and had bombers to strike NATO warships . Plus , the ekranoplans lacked the range to be useful as transports . The Navy accepted five out of a planned fleet of 140 and used them for trials , but none ever became operational . Aware of this long , painful history and the many inherent challenges of WIG aircraft , Boeing engineers have revived the concept , with a key twist . The craft they 're designing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It exploits the WIG effect , but it can fly like an airplane over terrain and land at an airport . It does n't need the ekranoplan 's thick , heavy boat hull , or extra power to haul itself out of the water . It has become the Pelican , sharing its broad , drooped wings with the birds that swoop over California 's coastline . The Pelican , as currently envisioned , will be capable of flying at the same speed and height  --  300 mph , up to 20,000 feet  --  as most other airplanes powered by turboprops ( jet engines geared to propellers , which , at Pelican 's speed , are more efficient than standard jet engines ) . The difference is that it will cover significantly greater ranges while hugging the water 's surface and taking advantage of the ground effect . There are two elements to the phenomenon . A wing lifts an airplane because the pressure beneath it is higher than the pressure above it  --  a result of the wing 's shape and forward movement . At the lateral tip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper surface . This creates a vortex , a rotating airflow that robs the wing of lift . But if the aircraft is flying very close to the surface , there is no room for the vortex to develop properly and it becomes weaker . The second element of ground effect is " ram pressure . " The higher-pressure air under the wing can not escape downward , as it could at higher altitudes , and a cushion of trapped air forms under the wing . An airplane in ground effect can fly on less power , using less fuel , than one at high altitude . Two numbers define the strength of the ground effect : the airplane 's wingspan and its flying height . The aerodynamic support generated  --  or benefit , in aviation jargon  --  is proportional to the span divided by the height . The increased aerodynamic support is one of the huge differences between the Pelican and the Russian ekranoplans . " It 's a function of span , " says Rawdon , " and that 's why a very large WIG makes sense . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight benefit " at 100 feet . " It goes up at 50 feet . At 20 feet , it 's really good . If we could fly at 10 feet , we would . " If built , Boeing 's Pelican will be powered by four pairs of 80,000-hp turbine engines , similar in size to the gas turbine engines used today in large ships . These will spin four pairs of 50-foot , eight-bladed , counter-rotating propellers  --  more than twice the size of any propeller in history . The cargo hold will be unpressurized , which will help make the airplane significantly easier to build  --  its vast size notwithstanding . Flying the Pelican will be a bit more complex than piloting conventional aircraft . Before a flight , crews and mission planners will use radar and photo imagery from satellites to check the weather en route , in order to exploit tailwinds and avoid storms . If the straight-line route lies across a landmass , the crew can decide whether it is better to fly around it or jump over it . Even if the ocean is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to cruise at very low altitudes most of the time . " We grow up watching Victory at Sea on television or The Perfect Storm at the movies , and we naturally have the view of the ocean being tumultuous and violent , " Rawdon says . " But the majority of the time it 's relatively quiet , serene and flat . " But Hooker , the former DIA analyst , thinks that even over a quiet ocean , the Pelican will be a handful . " The uglier it is in free air , the better it is in ground effect , and vice versa , " he cautions , meaning that Boeing 's choice of a long , thin wingspan over a short , stumpy one may make the Pelican excessively hard to control , giving it a spongy , undulating ride . One lesson from the ekranoplans , he explains , is that the vortex under the wing acts like a spring , yielding resistance between the airplane and the surface . With a stubby ekranoplan wing , the vortex is a stiff spring like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Cadillac , making control more complex . But Boeing is anticipating some complicated maneuvering , so the controls will be highly automated ; nobody is going to hand-fly the monster at 300 mph and 50 feet up . High-resolution radar will scan the sea ahead for ships , and the automatic control system will either turn to avoid them or lift the big airplane over them . On the ground , the challenge will be steering the Pelican  --  with 76 wheels arrayed centipede-like under its body  --  around taxiways designed for airplanes half its size . Hooker will watch with interest as Boeing continues its investigations in this area . He led a design study for a large ekranoplan , which included a look at whether a several-thousand-ton vehicle could use conventional airports . " It 's not the runway , " he says . " Most airports are located on high water tables , and the taxiways and aprons are built on round gravel . " A giant vehicle , he says , sets up a long , gentle seismic wave . " First you get cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months , things start to fall down . " Will the Pelican fly , or join so many WIG concepts in short chapters of the aviation history books ? Fortunately , Pelican should not require any breakthroughs in basic technologies , such as structures or propulsion . The next step , the engineers say , would be a three-year program to build and test a subscale Pelican . This would n't be a small airplane  --  it will need to be big enough to explore the ground effect over calm water  --  but it would be a simple one , using off-the-shelf technology . If the Army 's mobility study shows that the Pelican could be useful , work could start late this year or in early 2004 . But the Pentagon may not be the biggest market . The Boeing team 's commercial-airplane colleagues have informally discussed the Pelican with commercial cargo operators . The airplane carries 10 times as much payload as any current craft  --  as many as 180 standard 8-by 8-by 20-foot containers  --  and is 10 times faster than a ship . Unlike a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminating sea-to-land transfers . The idea of a vast oceanic fleet of flying container ships may seem outlandish , but so , in their day , did mass-market air travel , stealth aircraft and satellite TV . In the end , ground-effect flight may not just be for the birds . Bill Sweetman is a contributing editor to POPULAR SCIENCE . WIG idea PELICAN If built , the Pelican will be the largest aircraft ever flown , weighing 3.2 million pounds and able to carry 2.8 million more . The C-5 Galaxy , the largest cargo lifter in the U.S. fleet , weighs at most 769,000 pounds at takeoff . Ten Pelicans could carry the same cargo as a single Navy LMSR ( large , medium-speed , roll-on/roll-off ) ship , but could cover in one day the distance the ship takes two weeks to travel . size The Pelican 's outer wings fold upward for maneuvering in conventional airports . The propellers ( eight total , two stacked in front of each twin-engined nacelle ) are as tall as a five-story building . cargo capacity A two-deck , 29,000-sq. - ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate up to 17 M1-A1 tanks , or a combination of tanks , helicopters , dozens of cargo containers and passengers . how it works The wing-in-ground effect prevents the wing from creating lift-robbing vortexes  --  since at extremely low altitude there 's no room for them to form  --  and generates a cushion of air beneath the aircraft . The effect is stronger the closer the craft gets to the surface of the water . The Pelican would routinely operate at only 20 to 50 feet , altitudes at which it would burn half as much fuel as an airplane at high altitude . Illustration <p>
