// Our flood-prone property made poor farmland , but it ' s a perfect haven for wildlife . Find the strength of your land and let it work for you : This has been our philosophy on our 12 acres , located on the edge of Lake Erie 's Sandusky Bay . We decided to move to this land in Port Clinton , Ohio , almost 20 years ago . It belonged to the parents of my partner , Robin Arnold , and they generously deeded two acres to us , including a site for a house and a pond that Robins grandfather dug many years ago . We started with a mobile home , but then several years later replaced it with a modular home - nothing fancy just a little nicer , and we started to get interested in back-to-the-land living . When the time was right , we thought , we would like to buy a few acres and find a productive use for them . When we first moved here , a farmer was renting the rest of the property from Robins father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each year he lost more than half the crop to flooding ; he made his money off the insurance from the loss . Eventually , the construction of a dike reduced the flooding problem , but the property still was n't good farmland . The soil was a heavy clay that dried hard as concrete . When wet , the sticky clay clung to the bottom of our shoes like lead weights . Photograph Right : Gena Husman ( left ) and Robin Arnold ( right ) with their dogs Sasha and Frickie .

Plants pictured include the colorfully named Square-stemmed Monkey Flower ( purple ) and Sneezeweed ( yellow ) . // A few years ago , Robin 's parents decided to get rid of the farmer , which left 10 acres of land right in our back yard . We discussed whether we should wait and try to find a place that was a little more promising . After all , when we first moved here , we often had to put on knee-high rubber boots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , once , we found 3to 4-pound carp swimming around our feet ! Although our yard does n't flood like it once did , the 10 acres we were thinking about buying frequently have standing water , especially in the spring . But we were n't searching for the perfect piece of farmland , either , and so about three years ago , after much discussion , we bought the 10 additional acres from Robin 's parents , and we waited to see what the land would tell us . We did n't have to wait long . Left alone , the land began to revert to its natural state . Marsh grasses , wild flowers and dogwood filled in the once-manicured bean fields . Trees have begun to appear as if by magic - not hand-selected trees from nurseries , but species native to the atea whose seeds were borne on the wind from surrounding woods . Our land now offers cover and safe haven to many animal species . At first , we saw only a few small animals muskrats , mink , rabbits and birds . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one afternoon , we counted 22 in our back field ! Migrating birds that once bypassed the cultivated fields now stopped to rest for a day or two in the tangled underbrush before beginning the final leg of their journey across Lake Erie to Canada and beyond . The pond has become a wonderful spot for watching Canada geese . One family of geese spent an entire spring and summer with us , sharing the shade of the maple tree on the pond bank during hot summer afternoons . The parents raised their babies on the edge of the pond , and during nice evenings we would eat supper on the swing under the tree and watch them play on the water . One evening as we set our plates on the low bench in front of the swing , the whole family filed past , picked leftovers off our plates and then lay down on the grass around us . One day in late August , after the last goose finished molting , we heard a commotion coming from the pond - and we ran out in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead , honking . A day or two later they stopped back to say " goodbye " and spent one more afternoon with us . Then they left for good . Sadly , we watched them leave and wished them a safe journey .

From the beginning , we knew that whatever we did on the farm would have to work with the " temperament " of the property . Almost immediately , we discovered one way that our land was useful : Robin has been pursuing her interest in nature photography . Now , instead of getting into the car and driving for an hour or so to a park , all she has to do is step out the backdoor . She has upgraded her camera gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of us spent numerous hours reading everything we could find on small-scale farming , chickens , bees , canning - you name it . Finally , we purchased a walkbehind tiller and decided to plant a small vegetable garden to see what grows best in this type of soil . During the next few years , we plan to plant enough for ourselves and our families to eat , and a little extra to sell . We already know asparagus is a good possibility - Robin 's grandfather started an asparagus bed on this farm years ago that still produces . We also have researched different types of fruit trees apples , peaches and pears should do well in this type of soil , and we have planted some of each . Along with this , we are raising a few chickens for eggs , and we have four beehives . Robin does most of the hive maintenance and honey collection . We usually harvest two honey crops : one in the summer and one in the fall . Since we do n't have a centrifuge to spin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , " or honey that is left in the comb . We cut it into 4-inch squares and package it in clear plastic boxes . We usually give away the honey we do n't keep for ourselves . CHOOSING CHICKENS Both of us had seen chickens kept in cramped yards that soon became smelly mud holes , and we wanted a better life for our birds . Exploring the Internet , and reading books - in particular , The Chicken Tractor , by Andy Lee and Patricia Foreman - opened our eyes to the new possibilities of portable chicken coops that we could move around with little effort . The idea was that the chickens would work up the land by scratching around and eating grass and bugs while fertilizing the ground at the same time . They would never stay in one place long enough to make a mess or attract rodents or other pests . What a bargain - manual labor plus eggs ! We bought a chicken-tractor kit and built a mobile coop for the summer . As a winter home for the birds , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had been using as a storage shed . We got to work cleaning it out . The big decision was how many chickens we wanted and what breed to buy . Ohio is the second-largest poultryproducing state in the country , and there is no shortage of hatcheries within an hour 's drive of our property . We studied Web sites and catalogs , made phone calls and asked questions . We decided to start with eight to 10 pullets - maybe one rooster - and we chose Rhode Island Reds . Because we wanted them as friends , as well as for their eggs , we opted to raise our flock from day-old chicks rather than from started pullets . Everything seemed to be falling into place until the evening we went to our local feed store to pick up supplies for the new arrivals . We made the mistake of looking into the chick tank and came home that night with an additional 10 baby chicks - all of which were pullets , we were assured by the clerk . We watched in wonder as the babies grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them - including the one I had named Clara , after my mother - began crowing in the morning . Because we are both vegetarians , this created something of a dilemma for us ; when the roosters got to be about 15 weeks old they started fighting with each other and terrorizing the hens . Luckily , my niece came to the rescue by taking six of the seven roosters . We kept one rooster , Mumps , and our chickens began producing eggs late last summer . We 've had no shortage of customers for our " free-range , farm-fresh brown eggs . " We are still working out how to derive tangible products from the soil , but no matter what the end results of our efforts , we value the peace and tranquility we have found by living here . We 're glad that we did n't judge this land too harshly ; it continues to unfold its treasures to us .
