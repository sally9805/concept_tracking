I have a pretty good memory , but it 's got a mind of its own . It has never been very interested in holding on to anything having to do with numbers or spelling or ways of knowing when it 's appropriate to use a semicolon . It 's impossible to predict what it will decide is important . Sometimes whole years of my life have whizzed by and very little of what 's happened has stuck . But there is one year I remember in such vivid detail , I sometimes feel as though I 'm still in the middle of it even though it all happened a long time ago . I was eleven years old and in the fifth grade at Pine Tree Elementary when Arthur came to visit . I did n't see what the big fuss was about . Just because some guy named Arthur was coming to our class , we were supposed to wear our best clothes and be on our best behavior and not shout out and a lot of other things I did n't bother to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't listen to much of anything she said that year . I was n't interested , and I did n't care . Looking back on it now , I guess that might have had something to do with why she was always yelling at me . " Are you listening , James ? Best behavior , " Miss Miller said , giving me the big fisheye . My name is not James ; it 's Jamie . It says soright on my birth certificate , but I never bothered to tell Miss Miller that . Somehow it seemed right for her to call me by the wrong name . She did n't have any idea who I was . That day , while she talked on and on about Arthur 's visit , I did what I always did : reached back with my thumbs and plugged my earholes closed . But Miss Miller 's voice found its way inside my head somehow anyway , like smoke curling under a locked door . Arthur this . Arthur that . I pressed my thumbs down harder , then let go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster until it chopped up the words like cabbage for slaw and made it sound like she was speaking Chinese . I just kept doing that until she was done talking and it was finally time for us to go home . I hated everything about that year in Miss Miller 's class . We 'd moved to Traverse City in November , two months after the school year had begun , and by the time spring rolled around , I still had n't made a single friend . It was my own fault . It 's hard for people to like you when you ca n't stand yourself . " Best clothes , " Miss Miller had said . That was a joke . I had two kinds of clothes at home : clean and dirty . I did n't plan on telling my mother what Miss Miller had said . I knew she would just say , " Make do , Jamie . " She said that all the time after we moved in with my aunt Sapphy , at the Wondrous Acres trailer park on the south side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ours was the fifth trailer in a line of fifteen single-wides that sat on a flat strip of asphalt baking in the sun or rattling in the wind depending on the season . Some of the trailers had names over their doors instead of numbers , Tin Heaven and Dolly 's Spot . Ours was just plain old number five , but if it had been mine to name , I would have called it Make Do . We had a real house back when we lived in Battle Creek . I had a room of my own and , best of all , a cat named Mister . Mister was just a stray , somebody else 's cat that had run away , but after I fed him tuna fish and milk , he did n't run away from me , so my mom said she guessed he was mine . Mister was the first friend I had who liked me best . He did n't like anybody else to pick him up or even touch him . He slept on my pillow at night . I 'd lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling him everything , while he lay there purring until I was all talked out . I can close my eyes and , to this day , still recall the way Mister smelled behind his ears . One night Mister did n't come home . I called and called for him , but he did n't come . " Probably out looking for some female companionship , " my dad told me . " Ca n't blame a fella for wanting a little of that now , can you ? " Then he winked at me and laughed until his breath ran out and he had to cough . My mother shot him one of her looks , but she did n't say anything . With some people you can tell when they 're mad , because they yell at you and say things they try to take back later on , but my mother is the opposite . The madder she gets , the less she says . I do n't remember her saying much of anything that whole last year in Battle Creek . The next morning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to find him . It did n't take long . He was lying on his side out in the ditch beside the road in front of my house . At first I thought he was sleeping , but when I picked him up , I knew right away that he was dead . I sat there by the road for a while , holding him and telling him how sorry I was that I had n't been there to protect him . Then I took him inside , wrapped him up in a blue and white checkered dish towel , and put him in a shoe box along with a couple of cans of tuna . I got a shovel out of the garage , dug a hole , and buried him out in the backyard . Then I cried so hard , my eyes swelled shut and it looked like somebody had punched me in the face .
