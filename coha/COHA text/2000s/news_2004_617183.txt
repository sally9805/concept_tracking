<p> If recent polls showing retired Gen. Wesley Clark cutting into Howard Dean 's lead prove nothing else , it 's that a corner has been turned in the short race to the Democratic presidential nomination . <p> " It 's part people making up their minds , part people changing their minds , and also , Clark 's campaign has really come into its own . Before , the campaign was not really ready for the support that was there for it , " said Pamela Marsh , communications director of the New Hampshire Democratic Party . <p> Clark , the last candidate to enter the Democratic field and the one with the least experience in political campaigns , had some early stumbles after announcing his candidacy last summer . But a strong fund-raising effort in the last few months and more experience on the stump appear to have helped him gain his footing in several key early states . <p> Like another Arkansan , Bill Clinton , Clark has structured his campaign around a series of " town hall meetings , " fielding questions from voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Clark town hall at a senior center in Concord and was impressed with his performance before an audience of 500 . <p> Dean still holds a substantial edge in money and momentum , picking up key endorsements last week from former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sen. Tom Harkin , the most influential Democrat in the key early caucus state of Iowa . <p> But the pre-holiday sense that the former Vermont governor had all but locked up the nomination has changed . <p> In a CNN/USA Today poll released last week , Clark cut Dean 's lead to four percentage points , and in a Reuters-MSNBC poll , Clark trailed by only two points . Nor does the front-runner 's lead look insurmountable in several polls of key early caucus and primary states . <p> In Iowa , a poll released by KCCI-TV in Des Moines last week had Rep. Dick Gephardt within striking distance of the lead , trailing Dean 's 29 percent by just 4 points . The poll was conducted before Harkin endorsed Dean and before the release of some old video footage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " interest groups . " <p> In an American Research Group ( ARG ) nightly tracking poll of New Hampshire Democrats , Dean held a solid lead with 35 percent at week 's end , but Clark had moved past Sen. John Kerry , up to 20 percent . <p> In South Carolina , one of seven states voting Feb. 3 and considered a Southern bellwether , Dean 's campaign has been coming on strong in the new year , with the largest paid staff  --  36  --  and the first wave of Dean television and radio ads , joining Clark , Sen. John Edwards and Sen. Joe Lieberman on the airwaves . <p> Clark , a former NATO commander , also has a large staff , including seasoned South Carolina political veterans , and the support of former Gov . Jim Hodges . <p> Taking advantage of his late-year fund-raising success , Clark has been active in several early primary states that have n't received as much attention as Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina . <p> Clark is the only Democrat running television ads in Tennessee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa caucuses and holds its primary Feb. 10 . He has a large staff presence and the support of former Vice President Al Gore 's biggest fund-raiser , Johnny Hayes . <p> " There 's a great deal of movement going on here , " said Jim Hesser , executive director of the Tennessee Democratic Party , predicting Clark would " do well " in the state . <p> In Oklahoma , which votes Feb. 3 , an ARG poll conducted the week before Christmas had Dean and Clark in a virtual tie , with 24 percent for Dean and 21 percent for Clark . <p> " Clark has really moved up in the last month or so here , " said Oklahoma Democratic Party Chairman Joe Parmley . <p> There 's been anecdotal evidence in the past week of some movement in Iowa for Kerry and Sen. John Edwards . <p> Kerry has stepped up his television advertising in Iowa and New Hampshire , and he could benefit from a story in which the Dean campaign dismissed two low-level volunteers after they were caught posing as average voters visiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the endorsement of Iowa 's biggest newspaper , the Des Moines Register . <p> But at this stage of the campaign , they appear the two candidates with the most to lose from a surge by Clark , since both had hoped to jump-start their campaigns with early victories in states that increasingly look like Dean-Clark battlegrounds  --  Kerry in New Hampshire and Edwards in South Carolina . <p> Clark appears to be emerging as Dean 's strongest competitor in two Southwestern states that vote Feb. 3 . A pre-Christmas ARG poll in Arizona had Clark in second , with 20 percent to Dean 's 35 percent . The retired general begins this week with his first town hall meeting and most intensive campaign stop in neighboring New Mexico . <p>  --  Staff writer Matthew Quinn contributed to this article from South Carolina .
