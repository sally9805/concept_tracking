Section : REVIEW FORUM PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The brightly painted woodcarvings called alebrijes have become the quintessential form of " folk art " associated with the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca . Crafting Tradition : The Making of Oaxacan Wood Carvings provides an intimate and detailed look at how this invented tradition emerged to be a major icon representing the authenticity of Oaxaca and how it transformed the lives of individual woodcarvers and painters in the process of becoming a globalized commodity . Michael Chibnik , an economic anthropologist , has produced an ethnography that will delight economic anthropologists with a penchant for detail as well as others who are curious about the history of the woodcarving boom , its system of production , marketing , and consumption , and readers interested in the stories of the woodcarvers and painters and their families . <p> Chibnik originally set out to determine whether the woodcarving trade could provide a model for successful small-scale development in rural areas via craft specialization and export . He concludes , however , that the particular set of circumstances that created a boom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a demand for high-end pieces , a marketplace that encourages experimentation and specialization , and a strategic devaluation of the peso in 1994 - might not be easily duplicated elsewhere . He also points to the double-edged reality of the vertical integration of commodity chains such as the alebrijes . Woodcarvers and painters may have lost their autonomy through immersion in the global economy , but in the process many have improved their standard of living . <p> Chibnik finds that unlike the results of craft commercialization elsewhere in the world and in Oaxaca , the globalization of woodcarvings has not resulted in highly stratified communities with a merchant class and a piece work or laboring class . He embraces a mixture of economic ideas in predicting why some family woodcarving workshops are more successful than others : the importance of the household life cycle ; location , interpersonal skills and individual artistic talent ; and the ways that particular communities have been inserted at particular times into the global economy . The woodcarving economies Chibnik studied did not break into the kind of class structure proposed by Lenin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of a few larger workshops opened temporarily in the mid 1990s with 20-35 workers , most woodcarving production is done in family settings . <p> Chibnik emphasizes the importance of the entire household in the production process . While many alebrijes are now signed and understood by consumers to be the work of one particular artist , in fact , two or three people carve , sand and paint most woodcarvings . Some family workshops that specialize in lower-priced carvings buy unpainted carvings from other households or communities and finish them . Chibnik points out that while most high-end pieces are attributed to individual male artists , women are responsible for much of the painted decoration that gives the alebrijes their " whimsical , magical quality " ( words often used in advertisements for the carvings ) . The men , women and children of producing towns such as Arrazola , La Union Tejalapan and San Martin Tilcajete understand their work to be a collective enterprise involving a team of people . <p> In line with the author 's consistent attempts to make visible and credit all of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is distinguished by its efforts to focus on specific individuals with their own stories , talents and specializations . Chibnik devotes a whole chapter to the impact that another book on woodcarvings had on artisans and their families . Oaxacan Wood Carving : The Magic in the Trees , by Shephard Barbash with photos by Vicki Ragan , was influential in publicizing particular artisans and types of alebrijes . Perhaps in reaction to this earlier book , Crafting Tradition is replete with portraits ( both textual and pictorial ) of artisans and their work . The complaints Chibnik heard about individuals Barbash left out seem to have hit home , as he includes a wide range of people ( most with their real names ) in his book . This reader appreciated his effort , but at a certain point the show and tell by example model of writing seemed to be overused . Almost every chapter relies on the paraphrased stories of different families and artisans to illustrate such topics as how woodcarvings are made ; varying economic strategies mixing woodcarving with migration , wage work and subsistence farming ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for economic success . It would be interesting for readers to hear more directly from the artisans themselves in their own words instead of having their experiences and thoughts paraphrased . The inclusion of many different unique stories does , however , provide readers with a valuable understanding of the wide range of family workshops , communities and even individuals influencing everything from the kinds of products people make to their marketing strategies . The book also contains many black and white photographs of the artists and their work , as well as a beautiful color photo section by photographer Fidel Ugarte . <p> In discussing the multi-stranded economic strategies of woodcarving families , Chibnik makes it clear that for many producers , woodcarving is neither the only nor , in many cases , the most important source of income . Many of the consumer goods and housing improvements in woodcarving communities are as likely to come from migrant remittances as they are from woodcarving sales . The movement of people has been as important as the movement of capital and culture in the integration of the United States and Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of the border or to other parts of their own country . Chibnik emphasizes the importance of migration in his analysis of household and local economies , but this dimension is not consistently integrated with his overall discussion of the ways in which woodcarving communities are and have been inserted historically into the global economy . It is possible , of course , that the woodcarving towns may have levels of migration similar to elsewhere in the Oaxaca valley and the relationship to woodcarving may not be particularly significant . <p> Heeding calls for multi-sited ethnography in the age of globalization , Chibnik also explores the " social life of things " by tracing the routes that alebrijes take from their production in southern Oaxaca , to their purchase and redistribution through wholesalers in gift shows , to retail stores , and to e-Bay auctions on the Internet . In this way , he makes a solid case for how global demand for imagined exotic and traditional indigenous crafts connects producers and consumers in economic and cultural flows . Chibnik was able to get a former major importer to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed look at the volume , price turn-around , profits and risks involved in importing Oaxacan wood carvings . A woodcarving that sells for $5 in Oaxaca may be shipped to the United States , sold at a gift show to a retail store for about $15 , and purchased by a US consumer for $35 . <p> In line with his efforts to trace the economic and social life of the alebrijes , Chibnik devotes a chapter to their marketing in brochures , books and on the Internet , where he finds delightful examples of sites that imply that the carvings are part of ancient indigenous ( often Zapotec ) craft traditions in Oaxaca . The woodcarvings are a prime example of invented and re-invented traditions . Chibnik concludes that intercultural miscommunication is perhaps as responsible for the success of the alebrijes in the US market as their originality and artistic merit . But rather than condemn globalization in and of itself , he highlights the inventiveness of the woodcarving artisans , who he is sure will come up with another " traditional " craft if the woodcarving market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long history of producing for global markets and will no doubt continue to do so long into the future . Chibnik 's book is an engaging , detailed and delightfully illustrated document of this process . <p> By Lynn Stephen <p>
