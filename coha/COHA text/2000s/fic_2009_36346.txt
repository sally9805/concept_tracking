One <br> <br> North Carolina <br> January <br> Sarah kept to what little shadows the winter-bare trees provided as she worked her way through the forest that separated the Compound from the road . The full moon made this night an uneasy one for stealth , but she had n't been given much choice in the matter . Waiting even another day was potentially far more dangerous than acting , so  --  <br> She sensed more than heard a sound and froze , her arms tightening around the sleeping child . <br> " It 's just me . " Bailey appeared to step literally out of the darkness not ten feet away . <br> " Are you early or am I late ? " Sarah kept her voice as low as the other woman 's had been . <br> " Six of one . " Bailey shrugged and crossed the space between them . " Is she out ? " <br> Nodding , Sarah relinquished the little girl , who was warmly dressed to protect her against the January chill . " She should sleep another couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 're sure about her ? Because we ca n't keep doing this . It was n't part of the plan , and it 's too dangerous . Sooner or later , he 's going to figure it out . " <br> " That 's what I 'm trying to prevent . Or at least delay . " <br> " It 's not your job , Sarah . Not the reason you 're here . " <br> " Is n't it ? He 's getting better at choosing latents . Better at finding them and convincing them to join him . Better than we 've been . " Sarah was aware of a niggling unease that was growing rather than diminishing . " Speaking of , are we covered ? " <br> " Of course . My shield 's enclosing all three of us . " <br> " What about more-conventional protection ? " <br> " Galen 's got my back . As usual . But once we leave , you 're on your own again . " <br> " I 'm not worried about me . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bailey . " <br> " She 's six years old . " <br> " All the more reason . Without the defenses we can teach her , she 's vulnerable as hell , especially to someone bent on using her as a weapon . " <br> Bailey shifted the slight weight of the child and sighed . " Look , are you sure you have n't been . . . influenced . . . by what this guy is preaching ? All that prophecy stuff ? " <br> " We believe in prophecy stuff , " Sarah reminded her . <br> " Not the kind he preaches . " <br> Sarah shook her head . " Do n't worry , I 'm not a convert . It 's all I can do to keep up the facade of a loyal member of the flock . " <br> " Many more defections and kids disappearing , and that 's going to get a lot harder . " <br> " Harder than this ? " Sarah reached out a hand and lightly touched the child 's long blond hair . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in two days . " <br> Bailey 's mouth tightened . " You did n't include that in the report . " <br> " I was n't sure until today . But he 's gone . I think he was beginning to ask too many questions . He did n't believe his wife would have just run away , not without their daughter . " <br> " He was right about that . " <br> Sarah had been expecting it , but the news was still an unwelcome shock . <br> " She was found ? " <br> " A few miles downriver . And she 'd been in the water awhile , probably since the night she disappeared . No way to determine cause of death . " <br> Bailey did n't have to explain that further . <br> " Are the police going to come around asking questions ? " Sarah asked . <br> " They have to . Ellen Hodges was known to be a member of the church , and the last time she was seen it was in the company of other church members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to point the police in this direction . So if the good Reverend Samuel ca n't produce Ellen 's husband or her child , he 's going to have a lot of explaining to do . " <br> Sarah managed a hollow laugh , even as the sense of unease she felt grew stronger . " You 're assuming the cops who come here wo n't be church members or paid-off friends of the church . " <br> " Shit . Are you sure ? " <br> " From something I overheard , I 'm convinced enough that I say it would n't be a good idea to take any local law enforcement into our confidence . Not unless somebody on our side can read them very , very well . " <br> " Good enough for me . But Bishop is not going to be happy about it . " <br> " I doubt he 'll be surprised . We knew it was a possibility . " <br> " Makes the job harder . Or at least a hell of a lot more tricky . Not that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church so insulated . " Bailey shifted the child 's weight again . " I need to get the kid out of here . " <br> " Wendy . Her name 's Wendy . " <br> " Yes . I know . Do n't worry , we 'll take care of her . She has family who love her and will want her . " <br> " She also has an ability she 's barely aware of . " Sarah reached out once more to gently touch the child 's hair , then stepped back . " Protect her . Protect her gift . " <br> " We will . And you watch your back , hear ? You 've got a dandy shield of your own , but if it 's taking an effort to pretend you could belong here , Samuel or one of his so-called advisers could pick up on the fact that you 're hiding more than a bit of doubt about the good reverend and his real agenda . " <br> " Believe me , I know . " Something cold was spreading through Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberately removing herself from the other woman 's protective shield . " Tell Bishop and John that at least one of Samuel 's closest advisers is a strong psychic . I 've felt it . Not sure which one ; there 's nearly always a group of men around him . " <br> " Maybe you were just picking up Samuel . " <br> " No . With Samuel it 's just the way it 's always been , a . . . null field . As if he is n't even there , at least psychically . No sense of personality , no aura , no energy signature at all . " <br> " That 's more than a shield . " <br> " I know . I 'm just not sure what it is . I 've never sensed anything like it before . " <br> Bailey shook her head . " I was really hoping that had changed or you 'd learned to read him somehow . " <br> " I 've tried , believe me , every chance I 've had . But nothing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ? " <br> " Whenever I 've been close enough to try to pick up something . But I 'm not part of the inner circle or one of his chosen women . " <br> " No , we have n't been able to get anyone that close . " <br> " And I do n't know if we ever will . That inner circle is incredibly protective of him . And whoever the psychic is . . . he 's got one hell of a shield , a readable one , so it 's a given there 's something powerful generating it . But I 'm not sure what he can do , what his ability is . It could be anything . Tell them to be careful . Whoever else they send in needs to be careful . " <br> " Sarah  --  " <br> " I 'll report when I can . " Sarah turned and hurried away , her slender form almost instantly swallowed up by the shadows of the forest . <br> Bailey hesitated , but only for an instant , before swearing under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moved swiftly , even carrying the child , and covered at least thirty yards before she heard , from somewhere behind her , a sound that stopped her in her tracks and yanked her around . <br> The beginning of a scream , cut off with chilling abruptness , its echo bouncing around eerily in the otherwise silent woods . <br> " Bailey , move . " For a big man , Galen himself moved with uncanny silence , but that was n't the trait she was interested in right now . <br> " Sarah . Galen , you have to  --  " <br> " I know . Get to the car . If I 'm not there in five minutes , leave . " His weapon was in his hand , and he was already moving away , back toward the Compound . <br> " But  --  " <br> " Do it . " <br> <br> Bailey was n't a woman who accepted orders easily , but she obeyed that one without further question . Tightening her arms around the sleeping child and concentrating on intensifying the protective blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods toward the road and the car hidden there . <br> Galen had long ago perfected the art of moving through any type of terrain without making a sound , but he was all too aware that at least some of those who might hunt him in this forest could listen with more than their ears . Even so , he did n't allow the knowledge to slow him down , and he made good time . <br> Unfortunately , not good enough . <br> Then again , he acknowledged grimly , he had probably been too late at the first note of Sarah 's scream . <br> She lay on her back in a small clearing , in a pool of moonlight so bright and stark it was like a spotlight . The agony contorting her features seemed an almost unreal Halloween mask of horror . Her wide eyes gazed directly up at him , terrified and accusing . <br> At least that was the way Galen saw it . He was n't psychic in the accepted sense , but he could read people in his own way . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knelt beside her sprawled body , his free hand feeling for her carotid pulse even as he kept his weapon ready and visually scanned the woods all around them . <br> Continues ...
