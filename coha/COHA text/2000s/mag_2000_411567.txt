Tactility was central to a netsuke 's original function as toggle and talisman , and remains an essential part of its appeal as an art object , alongwith its small scale , detailed craftsmanship and expressive capacity . Netsuke carving in Japan began in the i6oos , had a golden age from 1780 to i85o , and declined with the end of the Edo period in 1868 , following the country 's opening to the West in the mid-18$os . Since the i97os , however , a new creative movement , international in scope , has quietly taken hold and revitalized the craft . More than a century after Japan 's introduction to Western-style clothing made netsuke all but obsolete , a small but dedicated number of artists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very deep art form , " says David Carlin , one of the most influential American netsuke artists . " We are a school of art . The traditional carryovers are inventiveness and imagination . " The Japanese masters of old used mainly ivory and wood to tell their stories , depicting an array of everyday as well as otherworldly subjects , from plants and animals to folk heroes and deities . While today 's carvers have expanded the range of materials , techniques and subject matter , most still strive to incorporate traditional elements of playfulness and profundity , subtlety and surprise , whimsy and fantasy , nature and humanity , parody and satire , history and religion , myth and legend . " Netsuke contains the macrocosm in this tiny , compact form , " says Valerie Anne Barber , another of the Americans who are reinterpreting netsuke while paying homage to its rich past . " That 's the dynamic that makes it exciting-huge concepts in a consolidated little form that 's very intimate . It has the power to move people in a way other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pocket , hold it in your hands , rub it against your face . There 's an entire world in the palm of your hand . " The netsuke community is insular , with perhaps a few hundred practitioners worldwide , and a tight core of serious collectors willing to pay up to five- and even six-figure sums for certain fine old specimens . Within this small world , there is debate as to whether contemporary work can truly be called netsuke at all . At the 1999 convention ofthe International Netsuke Society , the British artist Michael Birch delivered a lecture , " The Great Netsuke Myth , " arguing against " the delusion that only'antique " Japanese netsuke are authentic netsuke . " Birch , whose work of the 197os distinguished him as the first important Western carver , asserted that netsuke is a uniquely timeless art : " The great artist Henry Moore once told me that sculpture must be big to be important . Publicly important , perhaps . But he then agreed that netsuke can be perceived as being privately important . A netsuke does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach , like most sculpture . On the contrary , it can be held captive in your hand and explored with fingertips that have the most sensitive nerve ends in our bodies . Our fingertips can follow the form of a netsuke while our vision can examine it from every angle . And when that sensory duality , the tactile and the visual , combines in our brains , it sets up a special resonance in our minds that can not be matched by any other art form " If contemporary netsuke has its purist detractors , it also has its ardent champions , chief among them the preeminent Los Angeles collectors Robert Kinsey , a retired airline executive , and his wife , Miriam , a journalist , whose patronage and promotion of living carvers have been instrumental to the development of the field . The Kinseys are beloved by artists , who describe them in such terms as " the wonderful heart of the group " and " Mama-san and Papa-san to all the carvers . " The origin of what they modestly call " our engrossing hobby " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force officer , landed in Tokyo following the cease-fire.As part of U. 5 . Occupation forces there , and later as advisor to the Chinese Air Force in Nanking , he became fascinated with the arts and crafts of Japan-a passion Miriam came to share . With free lifetime travel privileges from his airline career , the Kinseys have since visited Japan more than a hundred times , seeking out and cultivating friendships with netsuke masters , as well as with fellow collectors such as Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Takamodo . Back home , they have devoted themselves to encouraging artists , fostering relations between Americans and Japanese , and increasing public awareness of netsuke . In the process they have written several books ( including Miriam 's 1977 Contemporory Netsuke , the first on that subject ) and lent portions of their extensive collection to museum and university exhibitions around the world . For the Kinseys , who love netsuke of all periods , the old-versus-new debate is , well , old news . " That sort of nonsense has subsided for the most part , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Robert . " My wife and I know most of the serious netsuke collectors and scholars around the world , and there seems now to be a consensus that netsuke is a unique and distinctive art form in the field of miniature sculpture , that it is ongoing with a promising future as well as an intriguing past " Netsuke has indeed come into its own as an art medium agrees the New York-based dealer Michael Spindel , the foremost specialist in netsuke by living artists . As an antiques dealer in the 7os , Spindel came across some netsuke by young Japanese artists who were trying to break out of the traditional mold . " The pieces were vividly contemporary , not trying to replicate the past , " he recalls . " They had a livelier , more original quality , bolder themes . There were influences of contemporary art-for example , you would see abstraction , or surrealism . I was attracted to the work , and I thought , There is a market for this that nobody is paying attention to . " ' He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , netsuke was " not respected at all . It was considered a utilitarian object that was out of fashion . The younger generation knew nothing about it . " Gradually he built a stable of Japanese artists , adding British and American ones as they emerged on the scene . Finding an audience for the work was n't easy , says Spindel , who sought to develop new collectors while also paying respects to the netsuke establishment . At first , " the mainstream group gave tremendous resistance . But we persevered , and one day a collector said , ' I only collect antiques-but how much is that new piece over there ? ' She bought it , and it caused a ripple . " The contemporary market gained momentum in the 80s , even weathering the 1989 ban on international trade in ivory . " That caused a lot of changes , " Spindel says . " First it was seen as a terrible disaster . Everybody figured we were out of business , since 80 percent of netsuke coming out of Japan was ivory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other materials , such as wood , horn and antler , while others dropped out . But there to fill the void were the Westerners , particularly the Americans , who have a great affinity for alternative materials anyway , and were more inclined to experiment with their creative possibilities . Significantly , they were also bringing new content to netsuke . " The Western artist basically freed the subject matter . It no longer had to be of ) apanese derivation . They could explore Western subjects or animals indigenous to the West , " says Spindel . " It 's really the American artist who took it to the next level . " The Ieading American carvers-there are probably fewer than 20 who could be identified as such-are a diverse group . " They 're all pretty eccentric . They 've generally come from some other technically demanding art form , and from a fairly mature , developed viewpoint . Almost all had an epiphanous experience , like I did , " observes Jim Kelso of Worcester , Vermont , whose work in wood and metal ranged from boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese holdings of the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum in Springfield , Massachusetts , led him to netsuke . ( Fora number of others , the Avery Brundage collection at San Francisco 's Asian Art Museum provided a similar revelation . ) Like most of his fellow carvers , Kelso thinks of his work as being outside the bounds of strictly functional netsuke , though all of his pieces feature the requisite himotoshi , or cord holes , and do , in fact , function . " If I call something a netsuke , I 'll want it to be a netsuke . Some might say mine are a little large or have too many protrusions . It 's less of a concern for me . That 's typical of the American artists-we 're more interested in the sculptural , artistic aspects , " says Kelso . " With netsuke you 're somewhat constrained by size and form , and I find that an interesting challenge . Working in any medium is always about finding a balance between challenge and freedom . Sometimes having too much freedom is stifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being based on a traditional art form , but not be confined to that . It helps to define what you 're doing and give direction.You know you 're working within a certain set of parameters , " echoes Gerald Milazzo , who had various incarnations as biochemistry major , ski bum , residential contractor and potter before finding his true calling carving netsuke in wood and fossil ivory . " It just grabbed me . It was a culmination of all my prior experience , and suited my nature more than clay . I 'm kind of picky and detail oriented . I like to have control . l tried to work clay more tightly than it wanted to be . I was fighting the tendency of the clay , which is a loose , plastic material " Milazzo is one of several prominent carvers clustered in Gualala , California , an artists ' community on the northern coast that is the geographic hub of contemporary netsuke . Its leader is Carlin , a true believer who has converted a number of artists to the netsuke faith since making his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carlin is the maverick , a daring and innovative interpreter of subjects ranging from cowboys and Indians to opera and Western religion . When first introduced , " his work met with tremendous success , because it stood out . It also caused shock waves , because it was abstract , surrealistic , contorted ; ' remembers Spindel , his dealer at the time . " As a total scoundrel , I like to kick the gong around . l do n't like the status quo , " Carlin admits , but he stresses , " l have n't broken boundaries , just stretched them . I abide by the integrity of the format as rigid ly as possible . " Though unconventional , his work is deeply , necessarily grounded in the Japanese aesthetic ; he describes his creative process as " thinking first in the Japanese , getting the aesthetic in your head-then makingthe jump : ' Netsuke is a quiet , solitary art , and Carlin finds that being part of a close network of like-minded souls stimulates and sustains him . " We need each other-badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to have others doing this . " The British-born Nick Lamb , a former graphic designer who has been carving wood netsuke fulltime for ii years , moved to Gualala in 1995 . " I felt isolated in England . Here , Pm among friends , " he says . " And we are really all friends , not especially influenced by each other . Even though we are competing for the same customers , it 's without too much acrimony . " Drawing on traditional nature themes-plants , animals , insects-Lamb has made his name creating vignettes that are meticulously true to life , but with a sensitivity that transcends mere technical tours de force . " He brought a true naturalism to the work , " says Spindel . " Most animals in the antiques were , if not indigenous , based on imagination . Tigers , for example , were cartoonish . Whereas if Nick did a tiger it would be extremely realistic . " The soul of Lamb 's work comes from his lifelong affinity for nature . " A piece has to have expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal , " he says . " It has to have movement , fluidity , little surprises . " Another who has brought a deeply personal expression to natural themes is Janel Jacobson of Sunrise , Minnesota . A onetime CONTINUED ON PAGE 68 ) ceramist ( she now carves in wood , bone and antler ) , Jacobson honed her powers of observation when she studied with the legendary Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain at the latter 's Pond Farm Pottery in Guerneville , California . Every Wednesday afternoon , she and the other students would do drawing exercises aimed at conveying the essence of objects from nature- " a shiny plum , a fuzzy peach , a living potato , a dead stone , a crumpled leaf " - much as she does today . For Jacobson , the challenge of netsuke is to look closely at her subject , identify its subtle , vital characteristics , then convey them in a way that is " recognizable but not absolutely perfect . " Tom Sterling of Whidbey Island , Washington , also likes to focus on " things you would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insect , a dead leaf in autumn-that really are beautiful in and of themselves . " A retired Air Force pilot , Sterling collected netsuke before taking it up about a decade ago . Like many carvers , he is self-taught ( the Japanese have an apprenticeship system , but no formal training program exists in the United States ) and improvisational in his approach to material and technique , using whatever works to get the desired effect . " There 's not a set of tools you can just go out and buy for netsuke carving , " he observes . " You take what you can find commercially and then you have to took somewhere else . " He enjoys technical challenges , and draws on his aerodynamics background to solve certain problems of carving in miniature . The design of an airplane 's wing , for example , illustrates that " often it 's shape rather than thickness that gives strength " -a principle Sterling once used to carve the thin , convoluted tentacles of a jellyfish . He chose white hippo tooth for that piece , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are very delicate need to be made in strong materials . " Whittaker Freegard of Cottonwood , Arizona , has focused on carving gemstones , precious to semiprecious substances such as quartz , jade and opal ( one of his favorites is petrified dinosaur bone , which gives him " the feel of working with a living beast and connecting with the ancient world " ) . These are fairly radical materials for netsuke , since they necessitate a slower , entirely different , more difficult process . " In carving traditional netsuke , you 're scraping or slicing or engraving . Stone is so much harder that you have to do an abrading technique.You 're rubbing or grinding , explains Freegard , whose clients include lapidary art enthusiasts . A serious music lover , he also makes netsuke instruments-tiny flutes , whistles , ocarinas-and is working on a series of netsuke portraits of jazz masters such as Dizzy Gillespie and Billie Holiday . Armin Miller and his wife and collaborator , Lynn Richardson , of Santa Barbara , California , have carved out their niche as the only major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even tinier audience , because ceramics is at the bottom of the netsuke totem pole , " says Muller , explaining that because Japanese ceramic netsuke were cast , inexpensive and breakable , their own solid porcelain work , though very traditional , initially made old-guard collectors recoil . " We would bring our things to the conventions and the reaction would be , " Are you kidding ? Contemporary ceramic netsuke ? Ugh , garbage ! ' Now , at least , they 're complimentary , " says MUller , who today serves on the board of directors of the International Netsuke Society . He came to netsuke from pottery , Richardson from commercial art . Another unique aspect of their work is that they are amongthe few carvers making complete ensembles for sagemono , or " hanging things " : netsuke , the toggle , inro , the container , and ojime , the bead or fastener . For Barber , another of the Gualala group , it 's a subconscious , spiritual dynamic-one involving both maker and viewer/handler-that gives a successful netsuke its magic . As a shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself through solitary pursuits like art and writing ; today netsuke gives her " the ability to look through my shyness at the world : ' Afull-time artist for about io years , she has also worked as a horse and dog trainer , gardener , and hypnotherapist whose specialty is helping artists unlock their creativity . Her subject matter tends toward the metaphysical , and she gets many of her ideas from dreams . She believes the qualities of netsuke are best understood as layers , from surface appeal to storytelling and symbolism ( a good piece must have " both personal and universal archetypes " ) , down to the essence ofthe maker 's message . " That deepest level is the individuation , reaching through to that real deep place . " It 's the necessary ingredient , she feels , in a medium in which artists must guard against being merely clever or cute . " Unless they bring that to it , it will be a very nice frog on a leaf , by golly . " To tap those inner depths requires self knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be no coincidence that most artists have taken a circuitous path to netsuke . Though she teaches and encourages would-be carvers , Barber , for one , worries about the future of netsuke , wondering if young talent will go the distance in a field that is so technically demanding and labor-intensive , and , like most arts , not terribly lucrative . As Carlin points out , " It 's one of the most physical crafts you can be involved in . Netsuke is hard on the eyes , arms , hands . It 's emotionally twisting . Your commitment must be total . You just do n't screw up . You have to throw yourself at it . " Then there is the uncertainty of the market . In Spindel 's view , " The major concern of the next decade is , where are the new collectors coming from ? The market took off in the 7os , but now collectors are aging . And it 's not an easy field to enter . You ca n't start with a hundred-dollar piece . " Prices for fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newcomer to as much as $io , ooo for the big names . Weary of seeing their work overwhelmed in large museum exhibitions , or relegated to the little glass case behind the gallery owner 's desk , artists are becoming eager for more serious attention from the mainstream sculpture world . " That 's the next major move . But there are obstacles . Size matters , " says Spindel , who thinks it is generally the rare discerning connoisseur who is willing to spend large sums for small objects . Nevertheless , some carvers are actively seeking a bigger , broader collector base that would free them to take more chances in their work , rather than compromise to survive . It may come down simply to savvy marketing . Recognizing that " the term contemporary netsuke " requires an audience that understands what netsuke is , " Carlin recently joined with Lamb and Milazzo to launch a Web site under the banner of " sculpture for the hand , " a term they decided most closely conveys the essence of their work . One designation they immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are grand pieces of sculpture . They just happen to be in a format that is diminutive .
