That 's green full of trees , and worse than a clear-cut ? Vast pine farms , which are rapidly replacing the woods with a new kind of Southern plantation . <p> Under a low winter sun muted by the leading edge of an ice storm sailing in from Oklahoma , I trudge up Moore Hill above the old Shottsville , Alabama , cemetery and gaze out over the new plantations of the South . The crop : loblolly pine , native to the moist piedmont between highlands and sea and pretty much a stranger to these hills . But these are n't just any loblollies . They are cloned " supertrees , " selected for swiftness of growth , straightness of trunk , and resistance to drought , disease , and insects . The overseer of all the plantations in view : Champion International , one of dozens of forest-products outfits frantically buying or leasing woodlands across the South . Before planting their superseedlings , the companies clear-cut and bulldoze the site to get rid of all native trees , shrubs , vines , ferns , mosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woody debris is burned off . Then they plant loblolly . As the pines mature , they are thinned and pruned . Native trees that return from roots or seeds are cut or killed with herbicides . Frequently the plantation is bombed with fertilizer pellets . Then , 15 to 20 years after they were planted , the pines are clear-cut , and the process begins anew . <p> Since mechanized forest removal became de rigueur in the 1960s , the industry has been excusing itself with ads that begin : " Clearcuts may seem ugly at first . ... " As I gain the brow of the hill , I have to agree . But here , on this frozen , snag-littered mud flow salted with land snails roasted white , there is something even uglier  --  a greener , more insidious threat to the environment apparent in the freshly planted pine seedlings that barely make it to my boot tops . Directly to my left , a rectangular plantation almost ready for harvest stretches to the next hollow like a roll of teased Astroturf . The plantation to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For miles in all directions , the earth is clad in genetically identical , genetically " superior " specimens of loblolly jammed into the dirt in straight rows  --  trees the timber industry calls " vigorous " and " thrifty , " all goose-stepping their way to harvestable diameter . <p> There is no genuine forest in sight , save a relict scrap to the north that contains hardwoods : oak , beech , dogwood , ash , sweet gum , magnolia , yellow poplar , hickory , cherry , and maple . It is a reservoir for wildlife , but also for what companies like Champion seek to correct  --  " deadwood , decadence , and disorder . " With a pine plantation , the forest has not only been removed , it has been prevented . Countless species of insects , arachnids , mollusks , amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals  --  each as much a part of a forest as a tree  --  are gone because the diverse vegetation on which they depend is gone . E.O . Wilson , a Harvard biologist and Pulitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 95 percent fewer species than the forest that preceded it . He compares the effects of tree farms on biological diversity to " building a line of Wal-Marts " <p> Over the past decade , tree farms have certainly proliferated like discount chains . The U.S. Forest Service estimates that plantations now make up 36 percent of all pine stands in the South and within 20 years will make up 70 percent . Like other industries , pine farming has migrated to the region for its mild climate , cheap labor , and low taxes . Trees grow more quickly here , and they cost less to plant , tend , and harvest . What 's more , most of the pine conversion is taking place on private land , where regulation is virtually nonexistent . More than half of evergreens harvested in the U.S. come from the South , making it the world 's largest pulpwood producer . <p> Before visiting Moore Hill , I spent an afternoon flying over northern Alabama in a light plane , inspecting endless pine plantations . Some cover more than 1,000 acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strips , and rectangles of sickly green draped across the dark forest . By the year 2030 , according to government projections , more than two-thirds of all forests in the state will be replaced by loblolly pine planted in orderly rows . People who do n't work for the forest-products industry call the process " conversion . " The industry calls it " reforestation . " What it really is is factory farming . <p> One of the reasons there are no meaningful controls on pine conversion is that forest-products companies have pretty well convinced the media and the public that " replanting " a forest once it has been removed is not only possible but admirable . Weyerhaeuser , which according to Business Week does " better than Mother Nature , " boasts that it " promptly replants " its clearcuts with " vigorous , young seedlings . " The company reports that in 1998 it planted more than 51 million seedlings in its U.S. " forests . " Georgia-Pacific , which manages 4 million acres in the South , plants 125 million seedlings each year and proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What the companies neglect to mention is that pine farming , like other large-scale , industrial agriculture , harms the environment and the economy . Pine plantations require enormous amounts of fertilizer and herbicide , much of which winds up in streams anti drinking water . They impoverish soil and destroy habitat , including wetlands . And they rob communities of valuable saw-timber for lumber and of real forests that produce clean water and provide recreation . Few of the profits end up in local communities , and many of the companies are multinational . Champion , for example , is owned by a firm based in Helsinki . <p> This is the second time the forest-products industry has marched like Sherman through the South . Having grazed off the timber supply in the early 1900s , the industry migrated to the Midwest , consumed that supply , then moved to the Pacific Northwest . By the mid-1980s  --  with that region 's old-growth rainforests fast dwindling  --  the industry returned to the South , where native forests had recovered from its previous visit . With much of the second-growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pine planting had been prohibitively expensive . But the Army Corps of Engineers ' newly completed Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway , connecting the rivers of the same names , offered a cheap way to transport wood fiber . Now even the stunted , twisted , genetically inferior stuff left by generations of loggers could be run through mills that grind them into chips , loaded on barges , whisked to the Gulf of Mexico , and shipped to Japan to be turned into fax and copy paper . <p> Today there are 156 chip mills in the South  --  110 of them less than 10 years old . Some can grind up to 3,000 acres of woods per year , clearing the way for vast tree farms . Between 1989 and 1995 , exports of Southern hardwood chips grew 500 percent . <p> Tom Bourland , a forestry-wildlife consultant who once worked for International Paper , defends pine conversion . " If you just want that go-back-to-nature bullshit and you do n't really know what you 're talking about , you can get a wide audience , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want industrial forestry ' on the landscape , what do you want ? Forestry is our No. 1 agricultural crop in Louisiana . There are all the jobs and the taxes that come from that . and you get all the environmental amenities . So what is you 're argument ? " <p> The argument is that pine conversion squanders real wealth . Ed Whitelaw , the University of Oregon economics professor who provided key testimony in the spotted-owl hearings and had to be assigned bodyguards as a result , puts it this way : " Let 's say you 're the CEO of one of these forest-products firms . Well , for you the long run is 8 or 10 years . No big deal . The long run for a politician is next November . Is pine conversion economically wise in the long run  --  the real long run ? I think the answer is unequivocally no . The companies have to cover the externalities that is , the costs they impose on others  --  and all the subsidies . If they do , then fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the subsidies that Whitelaw is talking about is the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway , which is now used primarily to transport wood chips . It cost taxpayers $2 billion to build , and costs another $2 million annually to dredge . In addition , the pulp and paper mills that facilitate pine conversion receive tax-free construction loans and millions of dollars ' worth of tax credits . <p> Alabama is particularly generous to pine converters . Among the benefits bestowed by the state is a tax exemption on almost $4 billion worth of timberland  --  an arrangement that , together with other tax breaks , deprives public schools of an estimated $50 million per year . So pine conversion is being underwritten in part by the future enlightenment and earning potential of Alabama 's children . An Auburn University study reveals that rural counties most dependent on the forest-products industry have the highest levels of unemployment , poverty , and infant mortality . They also spend $200 less per student for public education than rural counties less reliant on timber . Tax revenue that would have gone to schools and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance for fleets of logging trucks . <p> Another hidden cost of pine conversion is that young hardwood trees are ground into chips before they have a chance to mature into valuable sawtimber . Unlike Western logging , which is often conducted on public land , pine conversion happens mostly on private property where regulations are lax or nonexistent . Foresters for companies like Champion routinely pass out free seedlings and free advice to landowners , encouraging them to sell their timber before it matures and to " reforest " with loblolly . The landowner gets quick cash , the company gets wood for chips , and workers at local sawmills get laid off . Lamar Marshall , director of Wild Alabama , one of the state 's largest and most active environmental groups , showed me the results of this system as we toured the countryside in his truck . " Look there , " he exclaimed as we passed someone 's back 40 , a once-diverse woodlot replaced by a monotonous expanse of young pine . " If the forester is n't real ethical , he 'll cut every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a red oak , which might have been worth $50 or $75 in five years . " All trees look the same by the time a Japanese fax machine spits them into the holding tray . <p> In a forest , though , each species of tree has a unique function , contributing different nutrients to soft and water and providing food , shade , and shelter for different wildlife . Jonathan Evans , who teaches biology the University of the South in Sewanee , Tennessee , says the industry needs to quit pushing the fantasy that replacing all these trees with loblolly is " reforestation . " " Corn is a species of grass/he remarks . " Yet Midwestern farmers do n't go around pretending they 're restoring the tallgrass prairie . " <p> Farmers know what happens to soil used to grow successive crops of grain or vegetables . What happens to soil used to grow successive crops of pine ? I put the question to David Van Lear , a forestry professor at Clemson University . Industrial foresters , he explains , do n't know , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks someone should find out . " Most of the nutrients are in the topsoil that is sometimes bulldozed away with the debris , " he says . " There have been studies documenting the detrimental effects of that . If your cutting rotations get shorter and shorter and you 're taking more and more off the land , then you 're likely to run into nutrient deficiencies . That is something we can not tolerate as managers because then the resource is n't renewable ; you 're mining it . " Van Lear questions whether chemical fertilizers can cure the soil depletion caused by pine plantations . <p> As with other forms of factory farming , fertilizers incur costs of their own  --  to the companies that use them and to the fish , wildlife , and people whose habitat they pollute . Last fall residents of Sequatchie County on the Cumberland Plateau in southeastern Tennessee complained that they 'd been bombed by urea pellets intended for a Bowater pine plantation . " You could hear them hit our roof and splash in our pond , " says Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My husband and I got terrible headaches and sore throats . My sister had blisters inside her nose " <p> Hicks is among 27 residents who convinced a judge to issue a temporary restraining order and who joined in a lawsuit against Bowater and the applicator , Aerotek . According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press , citizens and county officials " ran into a stone wall . " Bowater refused to comment on the spraying , and the state said that there are " no regulations regarding application of fertilizer . " <p> While there are regulations for application of the herbicides used by pine converters to prevent the return of native plants , there is scant information on the long-term effects on fish , wildlife , and humans . One of the most commonly used of these poisons is Gadon , which can remain in the soil for two years and easily washes into streams , lakes , and ponds . Although it kills unwanted plants , Gadon is highly toxic to the microbes that help pine trees grow , and in laboratory tests on rats , it increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which help purify groundwater from fertilizers , herbicides , and other contaminants  --  are also being destroyed by pine plantations . Because they are heavily forested , wetlands pay for their own destruction : The industry finances their draining and site preparation by selling their timber to chip mills . A Duke University study found that pine conversion was responsible for more than half of all wetland losses in the coastal plain of North Carolina . Statewide , nearly two million acres of wetlands have been convened to pine . According to the nonprofit Southern Environmental Law Center , 91 percent of all destruction and damage to freshwater forested wetlands has occurred in the 13 Southern states . <p> The pace at which wet and dry forests are being converted to loblolly plantations has recently been documented by Jonathan Evans of the University of the South , who calls conversion " a vast experiment with no control . " When he and his colleagues studied aerial photographs of a single county in the deciduous forest cloaking Tennessee 's Cumberland Plateau , they found that 13,14 acres had been cleared for pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county 's hardwood habitat : 12 percent . <p> " No one knows what 's going to come back on these vast acreages , " says Evans . " There is no place in the United States where anyone has successfully restored a hardwood forest in upland conditions like this . The coal industry came and went ; that 's why we have a lot of the problems we do . Well , here 's another industry coming and going . It 's not in this for the long haul , but the people who live here are . What 's going to be left for them when these companies go to Malaysia or wherever ? " <p> Not all pine conversion takes place on private land . The Forest Service has gotten into the business , albeit in a more casual way . " The service is doing better , " Lamar Marshall tells me as we orbit in Chip Vercelli 's Piper Arrow over the Bankhead National Forest in northern Alabama . There has been no clear-cutting or pine conversion on this forest for the last three years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm that does pro bono work for more than 80 environmental groups ; one reason the Forest Service is doing better on the Bankhead is that WildLaw , on behalf of Marshall 's Wild Alabama , sued it every time it got ready to remove a tract of woods and cluster bomb the earth with loblolly . <p> Similar rehabilitation of national forests-and the people who manage them  --  is under way all across the South . In the last two years , a coalition led by Georgia Forest Watch has shut down clearcutting and pine conversion on the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests . Thanks to citizen activists and an agency-wide tilt toward resource stewardship initiated by Forest Service chief Michael Dombeck , new plans for these and other Southern national forests recognize past mistakes and call for the conversion of loblolly plantations back to native stands . <p> The pine plantations in the Bankhead forest differ from the private ones I 'd inspected in that they have been less intensively managed . Timber companies might even call them " slovenly . " Clearly , " deadwood , decadence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the pines have turned brown because they 've been invaded by Southern pine beetles , the boll weevil of the new plantations . Presented with a vast , unbroken smorgasbord of cotton , the real boll weevil had helped ruin most of the South 's traditional plantations by the 1920s , thereby encouraging the return of native forests . Will the pine beetle-part of those native forests  --  do the same ? <p> No one can say , but the beetle is currently undergoing an unprecedented population explosion . Because these insects look for stressed trees , the timber industry insists that they pose little threat to pine plantations . But Tom Bourland , the forestry-wildlife consultant , inadvertently acknowledges that tree farms have been hard hit . He blames the " back-to-nature types " that run the National Park Service for failing to control beetles 17 years ago in the Big Thicket National Preserve in Texas , allowing them to overwhelm their predators . " They moved on the prevailing winds northeast through prime forestlands in Louisiana and Mississippi , " Bourland says . " It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation in an aircraft today and not see evidence of that epidemic . " <p> Because pine beetles ca n't be controlled by pesticides , they are providing plenty of employment for independent loggers like Donnie Williams . Among his fellow professionals , Williams is downright aberrant in that he thinks in terms of ecosystems ; Marshall calls him " an environmental logger . " Because of his reputation , the Forest Service has hired Williams to selectively excise the moribund , beetle-infested loblollies it planted 35 years earlier . <p> I meet Williams at his salvage operation deep in the Bankhead . His quarter-million-dollar harvester-processor cuts the dying pines without even nicking the hardwood saplings interspersed among them , lays them horizontal , strips their branches , and slices them into identical lengths . As the logs hit the earth scraps of bark fall off , each perforated with tiny holes made by the emerging adult beetles and inscribed on the inside with tangled trails left by the larvae as they devoured the living cambium . <p> I ask Williams why he is n't cutting down the dead trees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beetle lives , " Williams explains . " He goes over to the live tree , waits on the bark , and eats the pine beetle when he comes out . " So the " deadwood , decadence , and disorder " that timber companies cut , scrape , and poison from the earth have a function after all . <p> Checkered beetles are n't the only forest creatures that feast on pine beetles . Many species of woodpeckers do , too , but because the birds need dead and moribund trees in which to forage and excavate their nests , they ca n't live in the carefully tended trees of a pine farm . Another natural control of pine beetles  --  parasitic wasps that lay their eggs on them  --  need the nectar of wildflowers for nourishment , but pine converters eliminate wildflowers , along with all the other seemingly useless flora . Nor can pine farms sustain the fox squirrels that bury puffballs which , in turn , inoculate the roots of native longleaf pines with nitrogen-fixing nodules , thereby facilitating better growth and better production of the cones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Dozens of gravestones in the cemetery bear the name . Some of the Shottses buried here fought for the Confederacy with the Bull Mountain Volunteers . Others gave land for the adjacent single-room church . Lee Shotts , 68 , his five children , and the older of his 14 grandchildren drive all the way from Roseville , Michigan , to fish for bass in the family pond . Once he caught a six-pounder . <p> The pond nestles in a wooded hollow at the base of Moore Hill , a four-minute walk up Bull Mountain Creek from County Road 13 . It is here that I encounter some of the " externalities " Ed Whitelaw has been telling me about . With the first big rain of the year , a torrent of mud , silt , and debris had swept down the feeder stream from Champion 's 100-acre clear-cut . The pond had always been transparent . Now it is Mississippi brown and crusted over with a scum of dirt , ashes , and sawdust . <p> Nutrients that have accumulated for centuries in forest soil are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud into ponds and streams each time pine converters remove all the soil-anchoring vegetation . Then , when the site has recovered from that erosion , the fast-growing pines are clear-cut and erosion begins anew . <p> Stepping over and through deltas of silt and mud , I follow the feeder stream up Moore Hill for several hundred yards until it goes dry . After Lee Shotts had complained to Champion , it hired a contractor to set up rows of hay bales , backed on the upstream side with black plastic . The mud that has flowed and hardened above some of these barriers is 18 inches higher than the mud below . In its upper reaches the stream and its banks are bare as the baseline from home plate to first base . Champion has burned and bulldozed everything , and it is all perfectly legal because forestry regulations on private land in Alabama , as in most of the South , are voluntary . <p> " You would n't want to eat a fish out of that pond now ; they 've ruined it " declares Lee Shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WildLaw director Ray Vaughan , says the firm hopes to accomplish three things with the lawsuit : compensate the Shorts family , punish Champion , and deter timber companies from clearcutting in ways that damage their neighbors . " They are logging without regard to their responsibilities to the people around them , " Vaughan says as we hike around the pond . " It can be done better . No government agency will hold them accountable , so we 're going to try . " <p> Where the cart path to Shotts ' pond joins the county road , a flock of perhaps half a dozen eastern bluebirds flashes over our heads . Bluebirds , which nest in holes excavated by woodpeckers in dead and diseased trees , ca n't exist in pine plantations . How many bluebirds , woodpeckers , and bass , I wonder , does a 100-acre pine plantation cost ? And would the public authorize such purchases if it knew about them ? At least the Shorts family is going to have something to say about it . Now the sky is beech-bark gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardwoods along the unconverted creek banks . From the dark valley all around us , branches of Alabama 's old , native woodlands rattle like the drums of the Bull Mountain Volunteers . <p> S ( COLOR ) : Native hardwood trees in the Bankhead National Forest in northern Alabama have been clear-cut and " converted " to pine plantations ( left ) . Most of the conversion takes place on private land ( below ) , where the timber industry is free from regulation . Pines are planted like crops in orderly rows ( bottom left ) eliminating biological diversity through a process that Harvard biologist E.O . Wilson likens to " building a line of Wal-Marts . " <p> One effect of pine plantations can be seen in the Shotis family pond in Shotisville , Alabama . A torrent of dirt , ashes , and sawdust from land clear-cut by Champion International has swept into the pond , turning the water a Mississippi brown . " You would n't want to eat a fish out of that pond now , " says Lee Shotts , who is suing Champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 2030 , more than two-thirds of all Alabama forestland will be pine plantations . <p> Donnie Williams carefully excises trees in the Bankhead National Forest that have been infested by the southern pine beetle . Because pine plantations replace diverse forests with " monocultures , " they eliminate trees inhabited by other insects and birds that prey on the beetle . With fewer natural controls , the beetle is now enjoying an unprecedented population explosion . <p> By Ted Williams <p>
