There was no house yet , just a wellhead where the house would be , under an overturned box to keep the sand out . Clay was building the house , and it would be one to live in for a long time , so they were trying to get everything right . From the passenger seat , Susan watched him wedge the box between the green metal stakes that kept it in place . He climbed into the car and threw the water sample into the backseat . <p> " Now , " he said , and he sat with his hand on the ignition . <p> " The sandstone , " Susan said . She checked her watch , hoping they would n't interrupt Albert 's dinner . <p> " Right . " <p> Clay backed the station wagon out onto the flattened grass of the road , past the bare area where the well-digging rig had pulled up all the vegetation . Susan got out and dragged the barbed-wire gate aside , and shook the dust out of her sandals before pulling her feet back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask Albert , " she said . They drove out on the empty two-lane highway . " You always know what to say to him . " <p> " What 's to know ? " Clay said . <p> The wind grew louder through the open window . " I just mean he trusts you , " she said . Albert was eighty-three , and he had welcomed them warmly-unlike some of the locals-without suspicion of their intentions ; he said he thought the town could use new blood . He liked Clay 's photographs and always asked Clay about his picture-taking . <p> " I wonder if we should take him something " Susan said . " Something he could use . " She tried to think what that would be . Not a book ; he did n't read . He had read the dictionary page by page growing up on a farm , waiting for the wheat to grow , and he knew all the words , but he said books with stories made him tired . Maybe sheet music ; he played guitar in a bluegrass band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandolin , the local plumber played fiddle . But she did n't know anything about bluegrass . <p> " Albert gets along all right , " Clay said . <p> Behind them the water sample rolled to the other side of the car with a thump as they turned off the highway . Susan flipped the visor mirror down to see if there was dust on her face , and pushed her hair behind her ears . Her skin had taken on the color of the desert bluffs , she thought , wrinkled at the corners of her eyes . Clay seemed to be moving in the opposite direction : in spite of the gray in his hair , he looked younger . <p> They pulled up past Albert 's irrigated peach trees and parked between his sky-blue ' 65 Ford truck and a washing machine missing all four sidewalls , so only the top and the guts remained . A pile of cut sandstone from the pioneer days , chiseled by pioneer hands , spilled down a slope into the rice grass and knapweed . Susan scanned the pale red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much exactly there was , how much might be buried in the lawn and under the visible stone . The stone had once been a schoolhouse . On a pilgrimage to the library in Blanding , Susan had looked up an old sepia photograph of boys in caps and girls in aprons standing before a tidy one-room structure with a peaked roof , the blocks held together by mortar now long eroded . <p> Clay went first up the porch steps , his hair flattened on one side from camping on the property , his two-day beard speckled with white . She followed , conscious of their empty-handedness , their lack of an offering when one should be made . As Clay pulled open the screen door to knock , he said , " You ask . " <p> " You 'll help , " she said . Then the door opened . <p> She was shocked by how much older Albert looked . A padded white brace over his shirt held back both shoulders but did n't keep him upright ; he bent at the waist as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes , behind thick glasses , were watery and gray . <p> " Albert , " Susan said , trying not to sound too alarmed . <p> For a long , awkward moment at the door , Albert seemed not to recognize them . " You 're back in town " he said finally , and he gestured them in . He moved a pillow to make room among the song books and music catalogs on the couch . Under the pillow , the floral blanket covering the upholstery was torn . <p> " Guess that 's in disrepair , " he said , and he sat on a folding chair at a card table stacked with opened and unopened mail . Susan tucked her skirt under her knees and sat on the edge of the easy chair . <p> " I fell last week " Albert said , his hand on the thick white padding of the brace . " I was on the phone long-distance , and I started talking-saying words that are n't words . Words I was making up . And then I fell backward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two buttons of his shirt and pulled the fabric off his shoulder , revealing a bruise the color of a black plum from his collarbone halfway down his left arm . <p> Susan flinched at the sight of the bruised skin , and regretted it . " Oh , Albert , " she said . <p> " Some people were here , I had some people visiting " Albert said . " I do n't remember what happened , but they got me to the hospital . " <p> " Do you need anything now ? " She wished they had brought something useful-a loaf of bread , a quart of milk-wished Clay were acting even a little sympathetic . The accident was going to make their request difficult . Albert was not what he had been . <p> " I still cook up big soups like when my brother was alive , so I 've got stuff in the freezer , " he said . He spoke to Clay , who flipped through a book of bluegrass songs . <p> Clay closed the book in his lap . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , but I can play , " Albert said , fingering chords in the air with his left hand . " If I could rest this elbow on something . Are we supposed to be playing somewhere ? " <p> " I do n't think so , not until you 're healed up , " Clay said . " The band needs you . " <p> " Well , " Albert said . " Yes , I have milk and everything . " He waved a wrinkled hand with flat , calloused fingers in Susan 's direction . " When my friends came by they brought me milk . " <p> Susan tried to think who the friends would be . " The friends who took you to the hospital ? " <p> Albert looked at her . " I was on the phone when I fell , I was alone . " <p> Susan glanced at Clay . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I thought you said friends were visiting . " <p> He stood , frowning , and rummaged through the papers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I was n't stuck on my back like a turtle all night . " He hobbled , bent over in his brace , into a back room . <p> Susan whispered to Clay , " Poor Albert . " She felt like the vultures that soared over the valley in the afternoons . <p> " Ca n't find the date the Catfish are playing , " Albert said , returning . " Losing my memory . Just ask in town . " <p> There was a pause while he sat back down at the card table . Susan was n't ready to abandon their purpose , but she did wish Clay would ask . Men turned to Clay , they trusted him . He did what he said he would ; that was why she had married him . But he also held to what he would n't do ; he had said , You ask , and he was sticking to it . She edged forward on the easy chair . <p> " Albert , " she said , trying not to sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to her . " We were wondering about that sandstone in the front yard , if you 'd be willing to sell it to us . " <p> Albert looked at her and said nothing . <p> " I mean , if you want to get rid of it , we 'd take it off your hands , " she said , with a little open-handed gesture and a shrug . <p> " The sandstone " Albert said , and he turned to Clay . " Have you talked to Kyle Yazzie lately ? " he asked . " Is he going to help you build your house ? " <p> " I think so , " Clay said easily , moving the bluegrass book off his lap . " He 'll lend us his backhoe , anyway . " <p> It was always the way , she thought : Clay got to make breezy conversation about gear and tackle , and she was stuck with requests and complaints . Kyle Yazzie was on the Navajo tribal council ; Clay and Albert would start agreeing about him in a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You should dig up a garden plot while you 've got the backhoe , " Albert said . <p> Clay looked to Susan . <p> " We 're not planting much , " she said . " Just desert plants we wo n't have to water . " She was embarrassed ; she felt strongly about water use and native plants choked out by imports , but she did n't like to proselytize . And she knew Albert liked his lawn , and liked the imports ; he said Russian olives made good shade trees . " I think we 'll grow some peppers , " she offered . <p> " Kyle 's a nice young man , " Albert said . " Plays a good banjo , too . " <p> " His kids have been out to play on our land , " Susan said , cutting off Clay 's agreement , and feeling foolish once she had done it . She liked Kyle 's boys , who chased each other shouting through the tamarisk . She liked his shy daughters , too ; the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , and where they would stray to . <p> Albert said , " Kyle was helping me with some paperwork , a couple , three weeks ago . I guess I trust him all right . I ca n't always see the numbers . " He shuffled magazines and bills around the card table . " Well , I guess I 'll give you that sandstone , " he said . <p> Susan said , " Oh , we 'd want to pay you for it . " <p> " It was the old schoolhouse , you know , when the town was settled , " Albert said . " It was cut from the massive sandstone around here . " He gestured at the bluffs outside the window with the back of one hand . " They built that schoolhouse before they built the church . I always thought the schoolhouse must have been prettier than the church . I never thought it was a pretty church , even when I thought I might get married in it . " <p> The thought of Albert in a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . He was n't a Mormon but did n't dislike them ; she had seen him argue genially with two boyish elders at his door . " Who were you going to marry ? " she asked . <p> " Oh , no one in particular , " Albert said . " I just thought I might . " He said it to Clay , who smiled as if he understood . <p> " It was a pretty schoolhouse , " Susan said . " It 's beautiful stone . We want native stone to build with , railroad ties , things that fit in . We thought before we cut new stone we 'd look for some that was already in blocks . " <p> Albert stood up to look out at the half-buried stone . " When my brother and I , he 's dead now , when we bought this place in ' 66 , that stone was there , " he said . " We built this house that year , had it built . I still have things to finish , like the molding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with yellow sticky-note reminders ; the doorjamb was painted Sheetrock . <p> " Works fine like it is , " Clay said . <p> Albert dropped his weight back down in his seat . " I 'm eighty  --  three , I 'm probably not going to finish it , " he said , and he looked at the back of his hand on the card table . " Those stairs still need to be carpeted . My brother was going to do that . Other things he was going to do . " He stopped . " Yes , okay , I 'll give you that sandstone . " <p> " You do n't have to sell it if you do n't want to , " Clay said . " Susan just wants a house that 's authentic . " He grinned at her , and she frowned . <p> Albert said , " My brother and I were going to build a house with that stone in ' 66 and had this built instead . Let 's call it tentative . When do you need it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan said , calculating . She did n't want to give him all those months to change his mind , but she had a guilty sense they should give him as much time as he wanted . " We can get it anytime . " <p> " Okay . Tentatively , you can have it . " Albert pressed lightly at his bruised shoulder . " I want to think a little more . " <p> " No problem if you change your mind , " Clay said . <p> The three of them walked out on the porch and looked down at the pile of rock . <p> " We could come get it tomorrow or wait till spring , " Susan said , fearing suddenly that Albert would forget the conversation and someone else would take the stone away . The people who brought the milk , or the ones who took him to the hospital-if those were , in fact , different people . " Whatever 's best for you . " <p> " Tomorrow ? " Clay said , looking at their station wagon in the driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that stuff out of here . " <p> " Clay 's building the house , so we 're not on any schedule , " Susan said from the porch stairs . She said it lightly , to cover her misstep . Of course they were n't ready to get it tomorrow . <p> " With me building , " Clay said , " we might never be ready . " <p> " I 'll think some more about it , " Albert said . " I wo n't sell it to anyone else , let 's say that . Other people have asked for it over the years , but I always thought I 'd get around to using it . " He pointed out in the yard . " Look , quail , " he said . <p> A covey of eight birds ran out in a line from behind one of the peach trees . <p> " The ones with quotation marks on their heads , " Susan said . The birds marched toward the tamarisk , seeking cover . " I do n't remember what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear them all the time , their call is like this , " Albert said . He looked hard at the planks of the porch for a few seconds , then whistled a three-note call . " It sounds like , How are you , how are you , ' " he said . " And the answer is like this- " He paused again and whistled . <p> Susan laughed . " ' I 'm just fine , I 'm just fine , ' " she said . <p> Albert smiled at her . Clay shook his hand . Susan walked down and leaned over one of the stones in the yard , hands on her knees . Other people had asked for it ; they were not the first . But they were the most current . They had the first yes . <p> " You can see the chisel marks , " she called up . " It 's not enough for a house , but maybe a wall . " <p> " A foundation , " Albert said to Clay on the porch . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clay said . " We want to see it . " <p> " Always thought I 'd do something with it . " <p> " You could put some more peach trees in where the rock pile is . I 'd help you plant them . " <p> Albert turned from the stone to look at Clay for a moment , his hand across the white brace on his chest . <p> " You still taking pictures ? " Albert asked . <p> " Yep , " Clay said . <p> Susan said , " You come out to our place when you get more mobile . And do n't fall down anymore . " <p> Albert smiled . " Do n't plan to . " He took off his glasses to clean them on his shirt . <p> " Think of a price if you decide to sell it , " she said . " I do n't know how much a rock costs . If we could even have a few of them , that 'd be great . " <p> " Well , maybe we can work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sure , " Clay said , and he started down the steps . <p> " We 'll think of something good , " Susan called , one hand on the car door , the other shading her eyes from the low evening sun . <p> Inside the station wagon , Clay started the old engine . " How am I gon na move those blocks ? " he said . " Low flatbed trailer , I guess . " <p> " Easier on the chassis , " Susan said , and they both were silent . The car was hot , the light no longer pleasant but flat and oppressive . The engine seemed loud as they backed down the drive . <p> " You wanted it , too , right ? " she asked . <p> " Sure , " Clay said . " Just do n't know how I 'm going to move it . " <p> " You were n't much help , " she said . But he 'd done all right , and anyway they had the stone . " It almost did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he knew he would n't use it . " <p> " You want to give it back ? " <p> " No . Someone else would just take it . " <p> Clay turned the car around in the clearing by Albert 's toolshed , and the water sample in the back rolled again to the other side of the car , bumping against the door . Susan looked over her shoulder to wave goodbye , but Albert did n't see her . He stood against the porch railing with his glasses in his hand , straight-shouldered in the brace and tilted forward , staring out at the spilled and overgrown jumble of stone , the peach trees beyond , the red bluffs across the river . <p> Susan took the water bottle in her lap to stop the irritating thumping , then looked out the windshield , away from Albert . " Are you sure he understood ? " she asked . <p> Clay nodded and ran a hand over his rough beard . <p> " If we think of something really good to do with it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad to take it . " She closed her eyes and found she could n't picture the stone as part of a building , only as free  --  standing monuments on their undeveloped lot , upright versions of the ruin in Albert 's yard . A bathroom wall with places for soap and plants but without a bathroom , a garden wall with no garden . With effort , she held those walls steady and added a framework around them , a roofed house between the shower wall and the garden . Windows and a door , stucco , visible beams ; she constructed the house until they reached the two-lane highway , the stone supporting ceilings and turning corners in her mind . <p> Author Affiliation
