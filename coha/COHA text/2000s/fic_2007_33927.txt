Chapter One : Shortcut ( I ) On Friday the cat disappeared , the White House phoned , and Jeannie 's fever-said the sitter when Julia called from the echoing marble lobby of Lombard Hall , where she and her husband were fting shadowy alumni , one or two facing indictment , whose only virtue was piles of money-hit 103 . After that , things got worser faster , as her grandmother used to say , although Granny Vee 's Harlem locutions , shaped to the rhythm of an era when the race possessed a stylish sense of humor about itself , would not have gone over well in the Landing , and Julia Carlyle had long schooled herself to avoid them . The cat was the smallest problem , even if later it turned out to be a portent . Rainbow Coalition , the children 's smelly feline mutt , had vanished before and usually came back , but now and then stayed away and was dutifully replaced by another dreadful creature of the same name . The White House was another matter . Lemaster 's college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once a month , usually to shoot the breeze , a thing it had never before occurred to Julia that Presidents of the United States did . As to Jeannie , well , the child was a solid eight years into a feverish childhood , the youngest of four , and her mother knew bynow not to rush home at each spike of the thermometer . Tylenol and cool compresses had so far defeated every virus that had dared attack her child and would stymie this one , too . Julia gave the sitter her marching orders and returned to the endless dinner in time for Lemaster 's closing jokes . It was eleven minutes before ten on the second Friday in November in the year of our Lord 2003 . Outside Lombard Hall , the snow had arrived early , two inches on the ground and more expected . As the police later would reconstruct the night 's events , Professor Kellen Zant was already dead and on the way to town in his car . ( II ) After . Big cushy flakes still falling . Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadillac Escalade with all the extras , color regulation black , as befitted their role as the most celebrated couple in African America 's lonely Harbor County outpost . That , at least , was how Julia saw them , even after the family 's move six years ago out into what clever Lemaster called " the heart of whiteness . " For most of their marriage they had lived in Elm Harbor , largest city in the county and home of the university her husband now led . By now they should have moved back , but the drafty old mansion the school set aside for its president was undergoing renovation , a firm condition Lemaster had placed on his acceptance of the post . The trustees had worried about how it would look to spend so much on a residence at a time when funds to fix the classrooms were difficult to raise , but Lemaster , as always with his public , had been at once reasonable and adamant . " People value you more , " he had explained to his wife , " if it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or they hate you for it , " Julia had objected , but Lemaster stood his ground ; for , within the family , he was a typical West Indian male , and therefore merely adamant . They drove . Huge flakes swirled toward the windshield , the soft , chunky variety that signals to any New Englander that the storm is moving slowly and the eye is yet to come . Julia sulked against the dark leather , steaming with embarrassment , having called two of the alums by each other 's names , and having referred half the night to a wife named Carlotta as Charlotte , who then encouraged her , in that rich Yankee way , not to worry about it , dear , it 's a common mistake . Lemaster , who had never forgotten a name in his life , charmed everybody into smiling , but as anyone who has tried to raise money from the wealthy knows , a tiny sliver of offense can cut a potential gift by half or more , and in this crowd , half might mean eight figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Vanessa , a high-school senior , being the second of their four children . The first and the third-their two boys-were both away at school . Her husband said , " Thank you for tonight . " " Did you hear what I said ? " " I did , my love . " The words rapid and skeptical , rich with that teasing , not-quite-British lilt . " Did you hear what I said ? " Turning lightly but swiftly to avoid a darting animal . " I know you hate these things . I promise to burden you with as few as possible . " " Oh , Lemmie , come on . I was awful . You 'll raise more money if you leave me behind . " " Wrong , Jules . Cameron Knowland told me he so enjoyed your company that he 's upping his pledge by five million . " Julia in one of her moods , reassurance the last thing she craved . Clever wind whipped the snow into concentric circles of whiteness in the headlights , creating the illusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four Mile Road was not the quickest route home from the city , but the Carlyles were planning a detour to the multiplex to pick up their second child , out for the first time in a while with her boyfriend , " That Casey , " as Lemaster called him . The GPS screen on the dashboard showed them well off the road , meaning the computer had never heard of Four Mile , which did not , officially , exist . But Lemaster would not forsake a beloved shortcut , even in a storm , and unmapped country lanes were his favorite . " Cameron Knowland , " Julia said distinctly , " is a pig . " Her husband waited . " I 'm glad the SEC people are after him . I hope he goes to jail . " " It is n't Cameron , Jules , it 's his company . " Lemaster 's favorite tone of light , donnish correction , which she had once , long ago , loved . " The most that would be imposed is a civil fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dress . " " You should have slapped his face . " She turned in surprise , and what felt distantly like gratitude . Lemaster laughed . " Cameron would have taken his pledge back , but Carlotta would have doubled it . " A brief marital silence , Julia painfully aware that tonight she had entirely misplaced the delicate , not-quite-flirty insouciance that had made her , a quarter-century ago , the most popular girl at her New Hampshire high school . Like her husband , she was of something less than average height . Her skin was many shades lighter than his blue-black , for her unknown father had been , as Lemaster insisted on calling him , a Caucasian . Her gray eyes were strangely large for a woman of her diminutive stature . Her slightly jutting jaw was softened by an endearing dimple . Her lips were alluringly crooked . When she smiled , the left side of her wide mouth rose a little farther than the right , a signal , her husband liked to say , of her quietly liberal politics . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were days when it all felt false , and forced . Being around the campus did that to her . She had been a deputy dean of the divinity school for almost three years before Lemaster was brought back from Washington to run the university , and her husband 's ascension had somehow increased her sense of not belonging . Julia and the children had remained in the Landing during her husband 's year and a half as White House counsel . Lemaster had spent as many weekends as he could at home . People invented delicious rumors to explain his absence , none of them true , but as Granny Vee used to say , the truth only matters if you want it to . " You 're so silly , " she said , although , to her frequent distress , her husband was anything but . She looked out the window . Slickly whitened trees slipped past , mostly conifers . It was early for snow , not yet winter , not yet anything , really : that long season of pre-Thanksgiving New England chill when the stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold . Julia had spent most of her childhood in Hanover , New Hampshire , where her mother had been a professor at Dartmouth , and she was accustomed to early snow , but this was ridiculous . She said , " Can we talk about Vanessa ? " " What about her ? " " The fires . It 's all over with , Lemmie . " A pause . Lemaster played with the satellite radio , switching , without asking , from her adored Broadway show tunes-Granny Vee had loved them , so she did , too-to his own secret passion , the more rebellious and edgy and less commercial end of the hip-hop spectrum . The screen informed her in glowing green letters that the furious sexual bombast now assaulting her eardrums from nine speakers was something called Goodie Mobb . " How do you know it 's over ? " he asked . " Well , for one thing , she has n't done it in a year . For another , Dr. Brady says so . " " Nine months , " said Lemaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , " he added , slender fingers tightening ever so slightly on the wheel , but in caution , not anger , for the weather had slipped from abhorrent to atrocious . She glanced his way , turning down the throbbing music just in case , for a change , he wanted to talk , but he was craning forward , hoping for a better view , heavy flakes now falling faster than the wipers could clean . He wore glasses with steel rims . His goatee and mustache were so perfectly trimmed they might have been invisible against his smooth ebon flesh , except for the thousand flecks of gray that reshaped to follow the motion of his jaw whenever he spoke . " What a mistake , " said Lemaster , but it took Julia a second to work out that he was referring to the psychiatrist , and not one among the many enemies he had effortlessly , and surprisingly , collected during his six months as head of the university . Julia had been stunned when the judge ordered the choice of intensive therapy or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't say I have n't earned it " - but Julia , who used to volunteer at the juvenile detention facility in the city , knew what it was like . She could not imagine her vague , brainy , artistic daughter surviving two days among the hard-shelled teens scooped off the street corners and dumped there . As her grandmother used to say , there are our black people and there are other black people-and all her life Julia had secretly believed it . So Lemaster had chosen Brady , a professor at the medical school who was supposed to be one of the best adolescent psychiatrists in the country , and Julia , who , like Vanessa , would have preferred a woman , or at least someone from within the darker nation , held her peace . She had never imagined , twenty years ago , growing into the sort of wife who would . She had never imagined a lot of things . " Cameron told me something interesting , " said Lemaster when he decided she had stewed long enough . They passed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather but not otherwise concerned , watching the sparse nighttime traffic with their shining eyes . " He had the strangest call a couple of weeks ago . " That confident , can-do laugh , a hand lifted from the wheel in emphasis , a gleeful glance in Julia 's direction . Lemaster loved being one up on anyone in the vicinity , and made no exception for his own wife . " From an old friend of yours , as a matter of fact . Apparently- " " Lemmie , look out ! Look out ! " Too late . ( III ) Every New Englander knows that nighttime snowy woods are noisy . Chittering , sneaking animals , whistling , teasing wind , cracking , creaking branches-there is plenty to hear , except when your Escalade is in a ditch , the engine hissing and missing , hissing and missing , and Goodie Mobb still yallowing from nine speakers . Julia pried herself from behind the air bag , her husband 's outstretched hand ready to help . Shivering , she looked up and down the indentation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on her face . Confused , she slapped them away . He patiently turned her back to look at him . She realized that he was asking if she was all right . There was blood on his forehead and in his mouth , a lot of it . Her turn to ask how he was doing , and his turn to reassure her . No cell-phone service out here : they both tried . " What do we do now ? " said Julia , shivering for any number of good reasons . She tried to decide whether to be angry at him for taking his eyes off the road just before a sharp bend that had not budged in their six years of living out here . " We wait for the next car to come by . " " Nobody drives this way but you . " Lemaster was out of the ditch , up on the road . " We drove ten minutes and passed two cars . Another one will be along in a bit . " He paused and , for a wretched moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the next was expected . " We 'll leave the headlights on . The next car will see us and slow down . " His voice was calm , as calm as the day the President asked him to come down to Washington and , as a pillar of integrity , clean up the latest mess in the White House ; as calm as the night two decades ago when Julia told him she was pregnant and he answered without excitement or reproach that they must marry . Moral life , Lemaster often said , required reason more than passion . Maybe so , but too much reason could drive you nuts . " You should wait in the car . It 's cold out here . " " What about Vanessa ? She 's waiting for us to pick her up . " " She 'll wait . " Julia , uncertain , did as her husband suggested . He was eight years her senior , a difference that had once provided her a certain assurance but in recent years had left her feeling more and more that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if you married a man because you wanted him to take care of you , you ran the risk that he would . About to climb into the warmth of the car , she spotted by moonlight a ragged bundle in the ditch a few yards away . She took half a step toward it , and a pair of feral creatures with glowing eyes jerked furry heads up from their meal and scurried into the trees . A deer , she decided , the dark mound mostly covered with snow , probably struck by a car and thrown into the ditch , transformed into dinner for whatever animals refused to hibernate . Shivering , she buttoned her coat , then turned back toward the Escalade . She did not need a close look at some bloodstained animal with the most succulent pieces missing . Only once she had her hand on the door handle did she stop . Deer , she reminded herself , rarely wear shoes .
