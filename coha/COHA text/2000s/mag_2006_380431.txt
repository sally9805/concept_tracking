Laurie Berkner has wanted to be a rock star ever since she was in high school . But when she dreamed of headlining a sellout touring festival , with fans dancing in the aisles of places like the Rosemont Theatre  --  a venue outside Chicago that has been host to Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie  --  this gig was not what she had in mind . At 36 , Berkner is playing the Rosemont all right , but there are face painters in the lobby and changing tables in the rest rooms , and most of her fans  --  2,500 of them at this show alone  --  come up only to her hips . " I planned to be a rock star , but I did n't think I 'd be doing this , " she says , surrounded by awestruck children backstage at the third show of Jamarama Live ! , the first ever preschool-music festival to tour nationally . " I thought I was going to be carrying amps up a flight of stairs at 5 in the morning . " Instead her show is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Berkner . It 's cool to play preschool . Deborah Harry of Blondie has a Disney-label duet with Perry Farrell , who is better known for his not-so-Disney work with the bands Jane 's Addiction and Porno for Pyros . Dan Zanes , former front man of the Del Fuegos , now makes albums with little gold PARENTS ' CHOICE AWARD stickers on the covers . They Might Be Giants , whose adult tunes have titles like Your Racist Friend , now has an album about the alphabet . And with Jamarama , little ones even have their own Lollapalooza  --  a traveling music festival with sippy cups instead of beer cups . <P> The tour started in New Jersey in October with Milkshake and the Ohmies , a band based in Baltimore , Md. , that introduces kids to world music and yoga at the same time . The first five shows were designed , says producer Dana DuFine , as a proof of concept , before a bigger run this spring , and all sold out . ( Scalpers were reportedly asking up to $350 for the $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March in California , with Zanes headlining . By the end of the year , DuFine hopes to have staged around 60 Jamarama shows across the country . <P> It took two bright sparks in the music industry to realize the business opportunities presented by a generation of hipster parents who came of age going to touring music festivals like Lollapalooza , Warped and Ozzfest and who would be willing to pay to give their kids the same sort of experience . DuFine , a former Polygram executive who started her career at MTV , and her business partner , David Codikow , manage the rock band Velvet Revolver and helped put together the first two Down from the Mountain bluegrass and country-music tours . But it was DuFine 's toddler daughter who planted the seed of Jamarama , innocently asking why she could n't see all her favorite bands at the same time . " I instantly picked up the phone and called David , " says DuFine . Weeks later , they inked a deal with Creative Artists Agency , which had created Warped and was involved with Ozzfest. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
