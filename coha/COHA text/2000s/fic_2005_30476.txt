Chapter One A Winter Eden The first flake landed on a blackberry bush in the creek bottom of Meadowgate Farm . In the frozen hour before dawn , others found their mark on the mossy roof of the smokehouse ; in a grove of laurel by the northwest pasture ; on the handle of a hoe left propped against the garden fence . Close by the pond in the sheep paddock , a buck , a doe , and two fawns stood motionless as an owl pushed off from the upper branches of a pine tree and sailed , silent and intent , to the ridge of the barn roof . The owl hooted once , then twice . As if summoned by its velveteen cry , the platinum moon broke suddenly from the clouds above the pond , transforming the water 's surface into a gleaming lake of molten pearl . Then , clouds sailed again over the face of the moon , and in the bitter darkness , snowflakes fell thick and fast , swirling as in a shaken globe . It was twelve minutes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hogback Mountain , exposing an imprint of tractor tires that linked Meadowgate 's hay barn to the cow pasture and sheep paddock . The imprints of work boots and dog paws were also traceable along the driveway to the barn , and back to the door of the farmhouse , where smoke puffed from the chimney and lamplight shone behind the kitchen windows . From a tulip poplar at the northeast corner to the steel stake at the southwest , all hundred and thirty acres of Meadowgate Farm lay under a powdery blanket of March snow . Cynthia Kavanagh stood in the warmth of the farmhouse kitchen in a chenille robe , and gazed out on the hushed landscape . " It makes everything innocent again , " she said . " A winter Eden . " At the pine table , Father Timothy Kavanagh leafed through his quote journal until he found the record he 'd jotted down . " Unbelievable ! We 've had snow one , two , three , four ... this is the fifth time since Christmas Eve . " " Snow , snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dogs , and more dogs ! It looks like somebody backed up to the door and dumped a truckload of canines in here . " Following his customary daylight romp , Barnabas , a Bouvier-wolfhound mix and his boon companion of ten years , was drowned in slumber on the hearth rug ; Buckwheat , an English foxhound grown long in the tooth , had draped herself over the arm of the sofa ; the Welsh corgi , aptly named Bodacious , snored in a wing chair she had long ago claimed as her own ; and Luther , a recent , mixed-breed addition to the Meadowgate pack , had slung himself onto his bed in the corner , belly up . There was a collective odor of steam rising from sodden dog hair . " Ugh ! " said his wife , who was accustomed to steam rising off only one wet dog . Father Tim looked up from the journal in which he was transcribing notes collected hither and yon . " So what are you doing today , Kavanagh ? " Cynthia mashed the plunger of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Violet looking out the kitchen window to the barn , and I 'm calling Puny to find out about the twins-they 're days late , you know . " " Good idea . Expected around March fourth or fifth , and here it is the fourteenth . They 'll be ready for kindergarten . " " And you must run to Mitford with the shopping list for Dooley 's homecoming dinner tomorrow . " " Consider it done . " His heart beat faster at the thought of having their boy home for spring break , but the further thought of having nothing more to accomplish than a run to The Local was definitely discouraging . Heaven knows , there was hardly anything to do on the farm but rest , read , and walk four dogs ; he 'd scarcely struck a lick at a snake since arriving in mid-January . Willie Mullis , a full-timer who 'd replaced the part-time Bo Davis , lived on the place and did all the odd jobs , feeding up and looking after livestock ; Joyce Havner did the laundry and cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake Eddistoe ran the vet clinic , only a few yards from the farmhouse door , with consummate efficiency ; there was even someone to bush hog and cut hay when the season rolled around . In truth , it seemed his main occupation since coming to farm-sit for the Owens was waiting to hear from his bishop , Stuart Cullen , who had e-mailed him before Christmas . * Heads up : * I will almost certainly have something for you early next year . As you might expect , it is n't anything fancy , and God knows , it will be a challenge . Yet I admit I 'm patently envious . * Ca n't say more at this time , but will be in touch after the holy days , and we shall see what 's what ( I do recall , by the way , that you 're spending next year at the Owens ' farm , and this would not be a conflict ) . He had scratched his head throughout the month of January , trying to reckon what the challenge might be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouge it out of him , but Stuart had asked for another couple of weeks to get the plan together before he spilled the beans . Now , here they were in the middle of March , and not a word . " You 're sighing , Timothy . " " Wondering when Stuart will get off the pot . " " He 's retiring in June and consecrating the cathedral-altogether , a great deal to say grace over . You 'll hear soon , dearest . " She handed him a mug of black coffee , which he took with gratitude . So here he sat , retired from nearly four decades of active ministry as a priest , toasting himself by an open fire with his good-humored and companionable wife of seven years , and situated in what he believed to be the most breathtakingly beautiful countryside in America . Why bother , after all , about some " challenge " that may or may not be coming . Had n't he had challenges enough to last him a lifetime ? His wife , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the farm , conveniently located twenty minutes from Mitford , she 'd decided to accomplish three lifetime goals : learn needlepoint , make perfect oven fries , and read War and Peace . " So how 's it coming with War and Peace ? " " I despise telling you this , but I have n't opened it once . I 'm reading a charming old book called Mrs. Miniver . " " And the fries ? " " Since Dooley comes tomorrow , I 'll be conducting my next experiment-to see whether soaking the potatoes in ice water will make them crispier . And I 'm definitely using peanut oil this time . " " I 'll peel and cut , " he said . He had n't seen any activity around the needlepoint plan , so he declined to mention it . " Pathetic , " she said , reading his mind . " I 'm all thumbs . Learning from a book is not the way to do it . I 've decided to let Olivia tutor me , if she has a free day now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears eye shadow might be fun . " " I 'm definitely a dud in the eye shadow department . " She thumped into the wing chair opposite him and took a sip from her coffee mug . " And what about you , dearest ? Have you accomplished all your lifetime goals ? " Oddly , the question stung him . " I suppose I have n't thought about it . " Maybe he had n't wanted to think about having any further goals . He closed his eyes and leaned his head against the back of the wing chair . " I believe if I were charged with having a goal , it would be to live without fretting-to live more fully in the moment , not always huffing about as I 've done in recent years ... to live humbly-and appreciatively-with whatever God furnishes . " He reflected for a moment and raised his head and looked at her . " Yes . That would be my goal . " " But are n't you doing that ? " " No . I feel obligated to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . I 've been a bump on a log these last weeks . " " It 's OK to be a bump on a log once in a while . ' Be still , ' He tells us , ' and know that I am God . ' We must learn to wait on Him , Timothy . All those years of preaching and celebrating , and doing the interim at Whitecap-what a lovely legacy God allowed you to have there ; and ministering to Louella and Miss Sadie and Helene Pringle and Morris Love and George Gaynor and Edith Mallory and the Leepers ... " She took a deep breath . " On and on , an entire community , for heaven 's sake , not to mention volunteering at the Children 's Hospital and rounding up Dooley 's little sister and brothers ... " " One brother still missing , " he said , " and what have I done about it ? " " There may be nothing you can do about it . There 's absolutely nothing to go on , no leads of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps Kenny is God 's job . " The fire crackled on the hearth ; the dogs snored . His wife had just preached him a sermon , and it was one he needed to hear . He had a mate who knew precisely what was what , especially when he did n't . " ' Let us then be up and doing , ' " he quoted from Wordsworth , " ' with a heart for any fate ! ' Where 's the grocery list ? " " In my head at present , but let 's get it out . " She opened the small drawer in the lamp table and removed her notebook and pen . " Steak ! " She scribbled . " Same old cut ? " " Same old , same old . New York strip . " This would be no Lenten fast , but a Lenten feast for a starving college boy who was seldom home . " Russet potatoes , " she said , continuing the litany . " Always best for fries . " His blood would soon get up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the menu . While some theologians construed St. Paul 's thorn to be any one of a variety of alarming dysfunctions , he 'd been convinced for years that it was the same blasted affliction he 'd ended up with-diabetes . " Pie crusts , " she said , scribbling on . " Oh , rats . For the life of me , I ca n't remember all the ingredients for his chocolate pie , and of course , I did n't bring my recipe box . " " I never liked the recipe we use , " he said , suddenly confessional . " You 're not supposed to even touch chocolate pie , Timothy , so what difference does it make ? Dooley loves it ; it is n't half bad , really . " " It needs something . " " Like what ? " " Something more ... you know . " " Whipped cream ! " His wife loved whipped cream ; with the slenderest of excuses , she would slather it on anything . " Not whipped cream . Something more like ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately flown south . " Meringue , then . " " Meringue ! " he said , slapping his leg . " That 's it ! " She bolted from her chair and trotted to the kitchen counter . " Marge 's recipe box ... I was thumbing through it the other day and I vaguely remember ... Let 's see ... Onions in Cream Sauce , Penne Pasta with Lump Crabmeat , that sounds good .... " " Keep going . " " Pie ! " " Bingo . " " Buttermilk Pie ... Vinegar Pie ... Fresh Coconut ... " " Mark that one ! " " Egg Custard ... Fresh Peach ... Deep-Dish Apple ... " " Enough , " he said . " I 'm only human . " " Here it is . Chocolate Pie with Meringue . " " Finish that list , Kavanagh , and I 'm out of here . " Ha ! He 'd denied himself as sternly as one of the Desert Fathers these last weeks ; he would have the tiniest sliver of that pie , or else ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled on his jacket and foraged in the pockets for his knit cap , and kissed her warm mouth . " You always know what I 'm thinking , " he said . His hand was on the doorknob when the phone rang . " Do try to find a haircut while you 're in town , " she said , picking up the receiver . " You 've got that John-the-Baptist look again . Hello ! Meadowgate Farm . " He watched her pause , listening , then grin from ear to ear . " Thanks for calling , Joe Joe . That 's wonderful ! Congratulations ! Give Puny our love . I 'll be over on Thursday . Timothy 's headed into Mitford now , I 'm sure he 'll stop by . " " So ? " he asked , excited as a kid . " Boys ! Weighing in at fifteen pounds total ! Thomas and ... " She paused , and looked all-knowing . " And ? " " Thomas and Timothy ! " " No ! " " Yes ! One named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there are two little boys in this world who 're named for you , and I hope you realize that people do n't go around naming little boys for a bump on a log . " Boys ! And because Puny 's father was long deceased , he would be their granpaw , just as he was granpaw to Puny and Joe Joe 's twin girls . His entire chest felt suffused with a warm and radiating light . He turned onto the state road , which had already been scraped for the school buses , and headed south past the Baptist church and its snow-covered brush arbor . He glanced at the wayside pulpit , which was changed weekly . if loving god were a crime , would you be in jail ? Getting around was a piece of cake . The heavens had given them only a couple of inches , and in a farm truck built like a tank , he felt safe and thoroughly above it all . Patently envious . Patently envious . What could a bigwig bishop , albeit his oldest friend , envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tape running in a loop and promising to work his mind into a lather . " I roll this whole mystery over to You , Lord , " he said aloud , " and thank You for this day ! " In truth , the whole day belonged to him . He would stop by the hospital to see Puny and her new brood ; he would run over to Hope House and visit Louella ; he would make a noon stop at Lew Boyd 's Exxon where the Turkey Club was lately convening ; he would have a chin-wag with Avis at The Local .... As for getting a haircut , he had no intention of trusting his balding head to Fancy Skinner ever again , period ; Joe Ivy had retired from cutting hair and wanted nothing more to do with such a trade ; trooping to the barber shop in Wesley would take too much time . So , no , indeed , absolutely not , there would be no haircut on this trip into civilization . The sun broke through leaden clouds and flooded the countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouted against the considerable din of the truck engine . Why had he felt so bereft and grumpy only a half hour before , when he was now beginning to feel like a new man ? He switched on the radio to the blast of a country music station ; it was golden oldies time . " I bought th ' shoes that just walked out on me .... " someone sang . He sang along , hardly caring that he did n't know the words . " Country come to town ! " he whooped as he drove into Mitford . Roaring past the Exxon station , he blew the horn twice , just to let the general public know he 'd arrived . He bent and kissed her forehead . " Well done , " he said , a lump in his throat . Two sets of twins ! May God have mercy .... " They 're whoppers , " she said , smiling up at him . His so-called house help of ten years , and the one whom he loved like a daughter , lay worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , feeling the rough palm that had come from years of scrubbing , polishing , cooking , washing , ironing , and generally making his life and Cynthia 's far simpler , not to mention indisputably brighter . " Thank you for naming one of your fine boys after this old parson . " " We wo n't call ' im by th ' fancy name . It 'll jis ' be Timmy . " " Timmy . I always liked it when Mother called me Timmy . " " Timmy an ' Tommy , " she said , proudly . " Timmy and Tommy and Sissy and Sassy . " " You 'll be the boys ' granpaw , too , " she said , in case he had n't considered this . " It 'll be an honor to be their granpaw . " " Father ? " Since he 'd officiated at her wedding several years ago , she had taken to calling him by his priestly title in a way that subtly claimed him as her true father . He never failed to note this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . " Yes , my dear ? " " I sure do love you and Cynthy . " There they came , rolling down his cheeks like a veritable gulley washer .... " And we sure do love you back , " he croaked . " So , how 's the food at Hope House these days ? " He sat on the footstool by Louella 's rocking chair , feeling roughly eight or ten years old , as he always had in the presence of Miss Sadie and Louella . " Oh , honey , some time it 's good , some time it ai n't fit for slop . " He noted that Louella said ai n't now that Miss Sadie , who forbade its use , had passed on . " You take th ' soup-th ' menu has th ' same ol ' soup on it every day , day after day , long as I been here . " She looked thoroughly disgusted . " What soup is that ? " " Soup du jour ! If they cai n't come up with more'n one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' with it . " " Aha , " he said . " My granmaw , Big Mama , said soup was for sick people , anyway , an ' I ai n't sick an ' ai n't plannin ' to be . " " That 's the spirit . " Louella rocked on . The warm room , the lowering clouds beyond the window , and the faint drone of the shopping network made him drowsy ; his eyelids drooped .... Louella suddenly stopped rocking . " I been meanin ' to ask-what you doin ' ' bout Miss Sadie 's money ? " He snapped to attention . " What money is that ? " " Do n't you remember ? I tol ' you ' bout th ' money she hid in that ol ' car . " " Old car , " he said , clueless . " In that ol ' Plymouth automobile she had . " Louella appeared positively vexed with him . " Louella , I do n't have any idea what you mean . " " Your mem'ry must be goin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , from the beginning . " " Seem like I called you up an ' tol ' you , but maybe I dreamed it . Do you ever dream somethin ' so real you think it happened ? " " I do . " " A while before she passed , Miss Sadie got mad ' bout th ' market fallin ' off . You know she made good money in that market . " " Yes , ma'am , she did . " Had n't she left Dooley Barlowe a cool million plus at her passing ? This extraordinary fact , however , was not yet known to Dooley . ( Continues ... )
