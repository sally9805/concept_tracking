Mark Morris ' latest New York City premiere , now being performed on tour , is irresistibly zany  --  and very , very smart . Set to Ethan Iverson 's delectably decorous salon-style arrangements of ' 20s pop songs , Dancing Honeymoon consists of 15 Chaplinesque vignettes through which Morris and his six yellow-clad dancers hurtle at breakneck speed . Like all great farces , this one is precisely calculated down to the last pratfall ; even when the props start flying through the air , everything goes wrong right on time . Keep an eye on Julie Worden , who dances like a Thoroughbred filly and makes faces like Lucille Ball . <P>  --  By Terry Teachout
