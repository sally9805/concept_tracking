naturalhealth Back in the good old days , I played bass fiddle in a five-member band . At that time , three of our band members or their relatives were using an herb known as stinging nettle to relieve arthritis pain . Although stinging nettle does cook up into a tasty vegetable , these musicians were n't eating it . Rather , they were stinging themselves with it by grasping the plant in a gloved hand and then swatting their stiff , swollen joints . This practice , called urtication-from nettle 's botanical name , Urtica dioica-dates back at least 2,000 years . Although it 's an odd  --  sounding practice , there 's no escaping the fact that it 's been around so long precisely because it helps so many people . Photograph Left : Tiny stingers in this nettle provide microinjections of chemicals that can help relieve arthritis. // Our banjo player kept a plant in his kitchen so he could self-urticate when his arthritis flared up . The guitar player 's motherin-law was unable to write because of arthritis in her hands , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother soon had stinging nettle taking over her garden and said her arthritis was much improved . Just so you do n't think that urtication is something only crazy musicians indulge in , my former secretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) kept a nettle plant in the office . She would use the nettle to discreetly sting herself when arthritis stiffened her fingers . On a before-and-after photocopied image of her hand , you could see how the swelling went down . Urtication often provides considerable relief , sometimes very quickly . I 've seen arthritic swelling subside within minutes after the stings were administered . THE CASE FOR THE STING I 'm open to the notion that stinging nettle 's anti-arthritis action is based on distraction , meaning the irritation of the sting simply takes people 's minds off their arthritis pain . That 's an explanation you might hear from medical doctors . But as a botanist , I think what 's going on is more chemical than psychological . The tiny stingers of the nettle plant provide microinjections of several chemicals responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me many of these chemicals might also trigger anti-inflammation action that would help relieve arthritis . The sting injects a histaminic substance and the body mounts an antihistaminic reaction , some of which goes to the sting , some to the other inflammation . On every continent where it grows , stinging nettle has developed a reputation as a treatment for arthritis . I do n't think that 's a coincidence . If you 'd like to give urtication a try , you should n't have much problem locating a plant . It 's a common weed throughout most of the United States . If you 're not sure how to identify it , someone who works at a plant nursery or your local county agricultural extension agent should be able to help . JOINTS IN TROUBLE Arthritis literally means " joint inflammation . " According to the Arthritis Foundation , there are more that 100 different diseases that produce joint pain and inflammation  --  everything from the flu to certain cancers . But when people say " arthritis , " they usually mean osteoarthritis . Also known as degenerative joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen different kinds of arthritis . Some 16 million Americans have it . The hips , knees , spine and tiny joints of the hands and feet are most frequently affected . Osteoarthritis usually develops gradually , beginning with minor aches that eventually lead to extended pain , stiffness , swelling and limited range of motion . Symptoms sometimes , but not always , subside with gentle physical activity . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , another form of arthritis , has a nasty reputation because it can cause crippling joint deformity . But many of the 2.1 million Americans with RA-approximately 75 percent of whom are women-have milder , noncrippling cases that flare up and subside mysteriously . Frequently both hands are affected , but RA can strike other joints , as well . In addition to joint pain , swelling and warmth , possi- ble symptoms include fatigue , fever , loss of appetite , enlarged lymph nodes , lumps under the skin and muscle stiffness after sleep or inactivity . Stiffness usually subsides with moderate activity . GREEN PHARMACY FOR ARTHRITIS Along with stinging nettle , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) and turmeric ( Curcuma longo ) . I consider these the herbal alternative to the new drugs I Celebrex and Vioxx . In one study , Indian researchers gave three to seven grams ( 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 teaspoons ) of ginger a day to 18 people with osteoarthritis and 28 with rheumatoid arthritis . More than 75 percent of those participating in the study reported at least some relief from pain and swelling . Even after more than two years of taking these high doses of ginger , none of the people reported side effects . Turmeric contains close chemical relatives of compounds found in ginger , so I 'm not surprised this herb also has a major reputation as an arthritis treatment . You can enjoy both herbs in a wide variety of spicy dishes , as well as using them for teas . Pineapple ( Ananas Comosus ) . Some intriguing research suggests bromelain , a chemical in pineapple , helps prevent inflammation . For some time now , athletic trainers have been recommending pineapple to athletes to prevent and treat sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arthritis . Bromelain can help the body get rid of immune antigen complex , compounds that are implicated in some arthritis conditions . It also helps digest fibrin , another compound suspected of being involved in some types of arthritis . If you need an excuse to indulge yourself with fresh , ripe pineapple , this is it . Red Pepper ( Capsicum , various species ) . Red pepper causes some pain on the tongue but ironically interferes with pain perception elsewhere around the body . The pain-relieving chemical in red pepper , capsaicin , triggers the body to release endorphins , nature 's own opiates . Red pepper also contains aspirinlike compounds known as salicylates . You can make a tea by mixing red pepper into water , but it would be a whole lot more pleasurable to have your red pepper cooked in a variety of spicy dishes . For a quick hit , try a splash of hot-pepper sauce in tomato juice . Just biting into a hot pepper releases some of your own painkillers into your body . Compounds in red pepper can also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . Researchers have discovered you 'll get significant pain relief if you apply capsaicin cream directly to painful arthritic joints four times daily . In one study of this treatment , the capsaicin cream reduced RA pain by more than half . Osteoarthritis pain was reduced by about one third . Photograph // Look for capsaicin in the ingredient list of over-the-counter pain creams such as Zostrix and Capzasin-P or ask your doctor for a prescription capsaicin product . If you use capsaicin cream , be sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterward : You do n't want to get it in your eyes or other tender places . Some people are quite sensitive to this compound , so test it on a small area of skin to make sure that it 's OK for you to use . If it irritates your skin , do n't use it . Stinging Nettle ( Urtica dioica ) . Beyond stinging painful joints , there 's another method of using this herb to treat arthritis : steaming the fresh leaves and enjoying then as a vegetable . Although you have to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when cooked . The Rheumatoid Disease Foundation suggests that three milligrams of boron daily may be helpful in treating both osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis . An analysis of stinging nettle provided by USDA scientists shows this herb contains 47 parts per million of the mineral boron , figured on a dry-weight basis . That means a 100gram serving of stinging nettle-easily prepared by steaming several ounces of young , tender leaves-could contain more than the recommended amount of boron . According to the Rheumatoid Disease Foundation , boron is effective because it plays a role in helping bones retain calcium . It also has a beneficial influence on the body 's hormonal system , and hormones play a role in helping the body maintain healthy bones and joints . Oregano ( Origanum vulgare ) . Studies are accumulating that the pizza herb , oregano , is a powerful antioxidant . Like other antioxidants contained in fruits and vegetables , the compounds in oregano may help prevent the cell damage caused by free radicals-highly unstable oxygen molecules that steal elecIrons from other molecules they encounter . Free radical reactions are probably involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general . And evidence is accumulating that antioxidants may help relieve osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis . In a test of nearly 100 plants in the mint family , of which oregano is a member , the pizza herb was the one that had the greatest total antioxidant activity . Research has shown the antioxidant activity of oregano and other medicinal mints is due in large part to rosmarinic acid , a compound with antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant and antiviral properties . Considering how highly it ranks for this kind of protection , oregano is definitely worth adding to your pizza , or any other food , if you have arthritis . You could also try my Multimint Antioxidant Arthritis Tea ( see recipe above ) . Willow ( Salix , various species ) , garlic ( Allium sativum ) and licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ) . Willow bark was the original herbal aspirin . It contains a chemical called salicin , which Bayer eventually transformed into little white tablets of acetylsalicylic acid , or aspirin . Willow bark tea had pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects similar to those of aspirin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea , you 'll have less risk of stomach upset , ulcer and overdose if you take the tea instead of the pills . Still , because willow bark might upset your stomach , I 've included licorice in this formula . Not only does licorice have anti-inflammatory effects , it may also help treat any gastrointestinal problems caused by the willow . But the formula is not quite complete without garlic . While long-term use or ingestion of large amounts of licorice can raise some people 's blood pressure and lead to other problems ( headache , lethargy , sodium and water retention , excessive loss of potassium ) , garlic helps reduce blood pressure . So here 's the formula for a well-balanced anti-arthritis tea : approximately three parts dried willow bark , two parts dried licorice root and one part minced garlic . Pour boiling water over the mixture and steep for about 15 minutes . If you do n't like the taste , add lemon and/or honey , plus ginger and turmeric to taste . Celery seed Since I wrote The Green Pharmacy several years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one especially painful type of arthritis . I started taking celery seed when I read it helps lower levels of uric acid  --  the gout culprit . In my database at the USDA ( www.ars-grin.gov/ duke ) , I found there are nearly two dozen anti-inflammatory compounds in celery , including one very important " miracle aspirin " called apigenin . I now enjoy curried celery when I 'm not on the road , celery seed extracts when I am . And celery or serendipity has prevented my gout for more than six years now . ( Knock my wooden leg . ) Brazil nut ( Bertholettia excelsa ) and sunflower ( Helianthus annus ) . SAM is shorthand for S-adenosyl-methionine , a chemical shown to have pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties similar to those found in the over-the-counter medication ibuprofen. // Dr. Duke 's Arthritis Broth To make this broth , begin with a couple of cups of water and add red pepper , burdock , black pepper , celery seed , dandelion , garlic , ginger , horseradish , juniper , lemongrass , oregano , parsley , sarsaparilla , thyme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow bark . Bring to a boil , then turn down the heat and simmer for a few minutes . I confess I have never made this broth in its entirety . I just opportunistically seize any of these ingredients that are near at hand . If you press me for a recipe , I 'd say use four dashes each of burdock , dandelion , parsley , turmeric and watercress ; two dashes of celery seed , garlic , ginger and oregano ; and one dash each of the others , as available . If this is too spicy for you , after the recipe to suit your taste . Multimint Antioxidant Arthritis Tea Rosemary and oregano are both antioxidant mints . Add several more antioxidant herbs to these two , and you get my Multimint Antioxidant Tea . The mints are basil , bee balm , horehound , hyssop , lemon balm ( also known as melissa ) , marjoram , oregano , peppermint , rosemary , sage , savory , spearmint and thyme . ft makes sense to top it off with a dash of ginger and turmeric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but several COX-2-inhibitors . Oregano has more COX-2-inhibiting rosmarinic acid than rosemary itself . I checked my database to see if , in addition to their antioxidant value , any of these herbs contain proven anti-arthritis compounds . Sure enough , basil had five , while marjoram , oregano and rosemary weighed in with a few each . How much of each herb should you use to make this tea ? My teas are never the same ; I use a little of this and a little of that . To satisfy people who need recipes , I 'll say use two parts of the ingredients you like and one part of those you find less appealing . Pour boiling water over the herbs and let them steep for 10 to 20 minutes before drinking . Photograph On every continent where it grows , stinging nettle has developed a reputation as an arthritis treatment . // SAM can be found in high-methionine seeds and Brazil nuts . It would take 250 grams of sunflower seeds ( about 9 ounces ) of 500 grams of Brazil nuts ( 18 ounces ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard dose of ibuprofen . It 's not feasible to eat that many nuts and seeds , but every little bit helps , especially if you use the other natural approaches this article recommends . Go ahead and sprinkle some sunflower seeds on your salad . And when you 're nibbling mixed nuts in company , do n't apologize for monopolizing the Brazil nuts . Broccoli ( Brassica oleracea ) and other herbs containing glutathione . Studies indicate people who are low in the antioxidant compound glutathione are more likely to have arthritis than those who have higher amounts . Vegetables rich in glutathione include asparagus , cabbage , cauliflower , potatoes , tomatoes and purslane . Fruits with healthy amounts include avocados , grapefruit , oranges , peaches and watermelon . Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) . Rosemary was known in antiquity as the herb of remembrance , which is fitting , since rosemary has antioxidants that help prevent aging in cells , and the aging process is certainly associated with memory loss . One Greek  --  American herb grower tells how her fishing relatives set out to sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was unrefrigerated , this food lasted for days , thanks in part to the antioxidant activity of the rosemary . Can an herb that keeps fish from spoiling help preserve your youth ? The jury is still out on that one , but rosemary has preservative powers comparable to the commercial preservatives BHA and BHT . And since we know that antioxidants do help treat arthritis , it makes sense that this antioxidant-rich herb would help thwart this disease . Vitamin C Vitamin C inhibits the progression of osteoarthritis in guinea pigs . Does it work in humans ? There 's no proof yet that it does . But it certainly ca n't hurt to get more vitamin C. Red pepper and many of the other herbs and vegetables mentioned in this chapter contain good amounts . 49 Arthritis Soup Here 's one for people who like quantitative recipes . // Start by combining the main ingredients , then season them with dashes of any of the spices and flavors that appeal to you . You do n't need all of every one of these , and you can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If an ingredient does n't appeal to you or is unavailable , simply leave it out . Place the water in a large soup pot . Add the cabbage , beans , celery , nettle , carrots , asparagus , dandelion leaves , dandelion root , spinach , eggplant , chicory , garlic , turmeric , licorice and evening primrose seeds . Season with the black pepper , red pepper , mustard , flaxseed , sarsaparilla , fenugreek and lemon juice . Bring to a boil over high heat . Reduce the heat , cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes , or until the vegetables are tender . Serves four .
