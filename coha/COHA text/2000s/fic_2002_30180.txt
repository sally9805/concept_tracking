IntroductionI was forced to write short stories by the exigencies of my life at a certain moment . Of course , that 's not true ; it 's just how I felt . For one thing , I did n't have to write a word if I did n't want to . No one was either asking to read what I wrote or offering to pay me for it , and the choice to write - which I was barely aware of making - was my own . I wound up writing short stories because I did n't feel I had the time or the imaginative energy left to me - after being a mother , having a job , and running a house - to undertake the longer kind of work , the work of the novel , to which I felt more suited . Almost arbitrarily felt more suited , I would have to say . In any case , I wrote short stories for a number of years of my life , and when I was almost finished doing that - though I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I was lucky enough to have a collection of them published . I had occasion recently to reread that book ( I was trying to decide on a story to read aloud in front of an audience ) , and what struck me about the stories after all these years was what an odd collection , in fact , they make . How different they are , one from another - in tone , in subjectmatter , in structure , even in length . Motley . This may not be how the collection would be received by others now , of course ; and actually , it was n't received that way when it was published , by and large . The reviewer in the Sunday Times Book Review , I recall , saw the stories as unitary . They were , she wrote , too much about sex and too little about love . ( Ouch . This was only my second book , and it was hard to feel so keenly that the reviewer did n't care for my work . But I consoled myself that if ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much about sex " might be just that remark . ) Still , I do think that writers often come around , willy-nilly , to doing , recognizably , what they do , even when they 're struggling hardest to do something new and fresh . This has happened to me sometimes with the novels I 've written . After several years ' work I 'll produce something that feels like a bold step off into new terrain ; there 's the long wait , it gets published , and the reviews say , essentially , " Oh , here she comes , doing that again . " I wondered , then , if the same stamp of personality would be evident in my choices for this collection . In fact , I even looked forward to that possibility , with pleasure at the notion of discovering something about myself by those choices . It was a small part of my motivation in saying yes to the job of editor - the first part being simply delight in having been asked , and the second being the notion that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was going on with it at this moment in its history and in ours . But the third , yes , had to do with the idea that I might in some way meet myself through the stories I had chosen . And after all , there must be some measure of hope in the editors who put this book together annually at Houghton Mifflin that such a mark , such an aesthetic or moral stamp , will be palpable - or why choose a different writer every year ? Why choose a writer at all , except to have the book shaped somehow by what his taste is , what his standards are ? ( Of course , the book is shaped too by what is Out There this year , and that 's pure chance , combined in some measure , I suppose , with the pressures of the zeitgeist and the power , or lack of it , of some prevailing aesthetic of and for the short story . ) As I 've looked over past volumes of this collection , though , it strikes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor 's sensibility . Or at least not apparently so . And it further strikes me that the volumes I admire most wear it least ; that the stories in these collections - the ones I like best - only seem excellent , each in its quite distinctive way , and not to have been chosen with any particular demands being placed on them except that : excellence . It seems reasonable to me that this should be so - that range and excellence should be available without a recognizable editorial imprimatur . After all , most of what a writer is likely to admire in others ' work is what she herself is unable to do , and this always encompasses a wider range of kinds of writing than what she is able to do . And so , after I 'd made my decisions , it was , oddly , with some relief that I discovered I could learn exactly nothing about my **28;493;TOOLONG by reading through all the stories I 'd chosen . In the aggregate they had no voice , they did n't speak ; separately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of its own instance . For example , I chose two stories about a deal that gets made and then goes awry . Both involve treacherous behavior . But what could be more different tonally than Leonard Michaels 's bemused , almost rueful account of Nachman 's foot-dragging and largely unconscious inability to keep the deal he 's made in " Nachman from Los Angeles , " and the story of John Henderson 's agonized alteration of the terms of his bargain and then the terrible price he exacts for that generosity in Karl Iagnemma 's " Zilkowski 's Theorem " ? Or , to move further to the ends of another spectrum , what could you say about Melissa Hardy 's " The Heifer , " so full of horrific events endured and indeed created by her otherwise stoic , even silent characters , that you could also say about Michael Chabon 's " Along the Frontage Road , " which slowly and elliptically reveals some measure of the human feeling underlying its seemingly ordinary behavior : the choosing of a Halloween pumpkin by a boy and his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - except that both stories are wonderfully done ? There are two dog stories ( and this may say more about me as a person , if not a reader , than any other choices I made ) , but Richard Ford 's " Puppy , " an account of a marriage revealed through the tale of what a couple does with a dog abandoned to their care , drew me because of the meandering , Peter Taylor-ish unreliability of the narrator ; whereas what drew me to Arthur Miller 's story , " Bulldog , " was the funny and unexpected and completely exhilarating account of the birth of creative impulse that ends it . Alice Munro is always utterly distinctive in the tone and fluid structure of her stories ( I had a teacher once who referred to that quality as the Munro doctrine - he disapproved ) , and " Family Furnishings " is no exception , landing as it does at its conclusion on a moment that would have been midway in the chronology of the story but that aptly captures what we know only by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assumptions about the meaning and aims of her life to come . But distinctive too is Jim Shepard 's astonishing " Love and Hydrogen , " the story of an illicit love affair set in the fantastic , enclosed , and doomed universe aboard the Hindenburg in 1937 , or Tom McNeal 's " Watermelon Days , " which takes us to the Dust Bowl era in South Dakota to depict the beautiful and unexpected momentary reprieve of a difficult marriage , or Carolyn Cooke 's " The Sugar-Tit , " set on Beacon Hill in impoverished gentility , an account of another complicated marriage told in brilliant language ( a tenor rising above " the rest of the men 's voices , in the quivery way of oil on water " ) - an account that ends with an act of the bitterest fidelity . Three of the stories speak of love and the immigrant experience , but with emphases so different as to make you forget the thematic connection - from Jhumpa Lahiri 's young graduate students wounding and exposing each other within their almost hermetically sealed-off universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwidge Danticat 's Haitian lovers , reunited after a separation of seven years , alternating between their pleasure in being together again and the powerful sense of things unspoken and perhaps unspeakable between them , to the sense Beth Lordan gives us in " Digging " of the generations of hidden and lost hopes and sorrows that lie under the lives of the Irish American couple whose meeting and marriage she describes . I found Jill McCorkle 's story " Billy Goats " remarkable for the unusual choice of narrative voice - it 's told mostly in the first-person plural ; and for describing not so much a unique action , which usually gives shape to a story , as a pattern of habitual actions which make up the ordinary life of an ordinary place ; and for the blessing pronounced on that ordinary life by the story 's ending . And I found E. L. Doctorow 's " A House on the Plains " remarkable for almost exactly the opposite qualities - its quite particular narrator , its long and intricate plot , the pace of its withholding and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repugnant fidelity running under the dark and complicated events . There 's " The Red Ant House , " by Ann Cummins , remarkable for being told in the quirky and slightly stylized voice of a child , about two girls trying to take control of their disordered lives by exposing themselves to the local bachelor ( yes ! ) ; and Alice Mattison 's elegant and very funny story about a woman finding a kind of grace in giving up control of her life , " In Case We 're Separated . " And there 's " Surrounded by Sleep , " by Akhil Sharma , an at once amusing and sad story about a boy slowly understanding the small consolations possible within what he 's also slowly comprehending as the horrific callousness of a world that has dealt catastrophe to his family . There 's a nearly plotless meditation on the necessary and painful evanescence of memory , set lovingly in the shifting world just after the Second World War in Japan - " Aftermath , " by Mary Yukari Waters - and a neatly plotted tale of loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rug , " by Meg Mullins - which ends with one of the most indelible images in the collection . They are fine , these powerful and distinctive stories , and my only fear in invoking what seems to me unique or startling about each one is that I may have been reductive . If that 's the case , I apologize to the writers of these stories , which I admire for so much more than the qualities that make them so markedly different one from another . But different they are , as they should be . Mongrel ( that dog again ! ) , nearly polyglot in its variety of style , this collection says nothing clear about the American short story today except that it 's healthy and strong and still exploring its realist roots ( there were almost no experimental works in the 150 or so stories Katrina Kenison sent on to me ) . That it 's being written by every ethnic version of American there is , about every ethnic version of the American experience there is . That it 's being enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That it 's being written by men and women in almost equal numbers , and that it 's being written equally about the present and the near past and the long ago . Perhaps the stories written next year or in the few years following will reflect more about what we are thinking of at this moment as our changed world - or perhaps we 'll find the world changed less than we thought . In any case , these stories , whose creation preceded that change , seem to belong less intensely than those imaginary stories-to-be to a particular time . Indeed , it almost seems that none of these stories needed this particular moment in history to be born . Far less , I 'd argue , did they need this particular editor to notice them . There may be one or two you would n't have chosen , had you been editing ; there may be one or two I would have chosen differently if the circumstances under which I chose had been different - if I 'd read certain stories in some other order or in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at 5 P.M. on a sunny day , for example . Well , yes . But since I 've come to the end of this process with these twenty on my list , it seems to me that they were the inevitable twenty . And having now reread them several times over as a collection , I 've confirmed that , for myself anyway . And confirmed something else . These stories arrived in my life at an odd time . I 'd been working for six months on a nonfiction book , my first ever ; then , seconds after I turned that in , I was sent on the road to flog the novel I 'd finished months earlier . By the end of the tour I had n't written fiction in almost a year , and sometimes I thought that if one more sweetly inquisitive aspiring writer asked me where I got my ideas from , I 'd cry out , " Oh God , I do n't know . How would I know ? " and exit stage left . I did n't do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as though these stories arrived in the nick of time to make me believe again in that place - the place where ideas come from - and to teach me once more what we read fiction for . I 'm grateful . Sue Miller
