Tyler Creed suppressed a grin as the old guy in the Wal-Mart parking lot stared , dumbfounded , at the fancy set of keys resting in his work-roughened palm . Blinked a couple of times , like somebody trying to shake off an illusion , then gave the brim of his well-worn baseball cap an anxious tug . According to the bright yellow stitching on the hat , his name was Walt and he was the world 's greatest dad . <p> Walt looked at his ten-year-old Chevy truck , the sides streaked with dry dirt , the mud flaps coated , and then shifted to stare at Tyler 's shiny white Escalade . <p> " I thought you was kiddin ' , mister , " he said . " You really want to trade that Cadillac , straight across , for my old rig ? It 's got near a hundred thousand miles on it , this junker , and every once in a while , a part falls off . Last week , it was the muffler  --  " <p> Tyler nodded , weary of Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the idea , " he replied quietly . <p> The aging redneck approached the Cadillac , touched the hood with something like reverence . " Is this thing stolen ? " Walt asked , understandably suspicious . After all , Tyler reflected , a man did n't run across a deal like that every day , especially in Crap Creek , Montana , or whatever the hell that wide spot in the road was called . <p> Tyler chuckled . " No , sir , " he said . " I own it , fair and square . The title 's in the glove compartment . You agree , and I 'll sign off on it right now , and be on my way . " <p> " Wait till Myrtle comes out with the groceries and sees this , " the old fella marveled , hooking his thumbs in the straps of his greasy bib overalls , shaking his head once and finally cutting loose with a gap-toothed smile . Walt needed dental work . <p> Tyler waited . <p> " I still do n't understand why any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Walt insisted . " Could be , you 're not right in the head . " He paused , squinted up into Tyler 's impassive face . " You look all right , though . " <p> Involuntarily , Tyler glanced at his watch , an expensive number with a twenty-four-karat-gold rodeo cowboy riding a bronc inlaid in the platinum face . Diamonds glittered at the twelve , three , six and nine spots , and the thing was as incongruous with who he was as the pricey SUV he was virtually giving away , but he 'd never considered parting with the watch . His late wife , Shawna , had sold her horse trailer and a jeweled saddle she 'd won in a barrel racing event to buy it for him , the day he took his first championship . <p> " I do n't know as I 'm eager to trade with a man in a hurry , " Walt said astutely , narrowing his weary eyes a little . " You 're runnin ' from somethin ' , and it might be the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you . Myrtle and me , we got ourselves a nice life  --  nothin ' fancy  --  I worked at the lumber mill for thirty years  --  but the double-wide is paid off and we manage to scrape together ten bucks for each of the grandchildren on their birthdays  --  " <p> Tyler suppressed a sigh . <p> " That 's some watch , " Walt observed , in no particular hurry to finalize the bargain . The wise gaze took in Tyler 's jeans and shirt , newly purchased at rollback prices , lingered on his costly boots , handmade in a specialty shop in Texas . Rose again to his black Western hat , pulled low over his eyes . " You win it rodeoin ' or somethin ' ? " <p> " Or something , " Tyler confirmed . His own brothers , Logan and Dylan , did n't know about his marriage to Shawna , or the accident that had killed her ; he was n't about to confide in a stranger he 'd met in the parking lot at Wal-Mart . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another leisurely once-over . " Sorta familiar , too . " <p> You look like a forklift driver , Tyler responded silently . He looped his thumbs in the waistband of his stiff new jeans . " Deal or no deal ? " he asked mildly . <p> " Let me see that title , " Walt said , still hedging his bets . " And some identification , if you do n't mind . " <p> Knowing it would n't matter if he did mind , Tyler fetched the requested document from the SUV , pausing to pat the ugly dog he 'd found half-starved in another parking lot , in another town , on the long road home . <p> " Dog part of the swap ? " Walt asked , getting cagier now . <p> " No , " Tyler said . " He stays with me . " <p> Walt looked regretful . " That 's too bad . Ever since my blue tick hound , Minford , died of old age last winter , I 've been hankerin ' to get me another dog . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day to bank-roll her bingo habit , I 'm alone a lot . " <p> " Plenty of dogs in need of homes , " Tyler pointed out . " The shelters are full of them . " <p> " Reckon that 's so , " Walt agreed . He studied the title Tyler handed over like it was a summons or something . " Looks all right , " he said . " Let 's see that ID . " <p> Tyler pulled his wallet from his hip pocket and produced a driver 's license . <p> Walt 's rheumy eyes widened a little , and he whistled , low and shrill , in exclamation . " Tyler Creed , " he said . " I thought I 'd heard that name before , when I saw it on the title to this Caddie of yours . Four times world champion bronc-rider . Seen you on ESPN many a time . In some TV commercials , too . Takes guts to stand in front of a camera wearing nothing but boxer-briefs and a shit-eatin ' grin the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . My daughter Margie has a calendar full of pictures of you  --  two years out of date and she still wo n't take it down off the wall . Pisses her husband off somethin ' fierce . " <p> Inwardly , Tyler sighed . Outwardly , he stayed cool . <p> " Myrtle and me , we 'd be glad to have you come to our place for supper , " Walt went on . <p> " No time , " Tyler said , hoping he sounded regretful . <p> Walt looked him over once more , shook his head again and got his own paperwork out of that rattletrap truck of his . Signed his name on the dotted line . " Just let me fetch my toolbox out of the back , " he said . <p> " I 'll get my own gear while you 're doing that , " Tyler answered , relieved . <p> The switch was made . Tyler had his duffel bag , his dog and his guitar case in the Chevy before Walt set his red metal toolbox in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to supper ? " Walt asked , as a woman emerged from Wal-Mart and headed toward them , pushing a cart and looking puzzled . <p> " Wish I could , " Tyler lied , climbing into the Chevy . If he drove hard , he and Kit Carson , the dog , would be in Stillwater Springs by the time the sun went down . They 'd lie low at the cabin overnight , and come morning , he 'd find his brother Logan and punch him in the face . <p> Again . <p> Maybe he 'd put Dylan 's lights out , too , for good measure . <p> But mainly , heading home was about facing up to some things , settling them in his mind . <p> " See you , " he told Walt . <p> And before the old man could answer , Tyler laid rubber . <p> Five miles outside Crap Creek , the Chevy 's muffler dropped to the blacktop and dragged , with an earsplit-ting clatter , throwing blue and orange sparks . <p> " Shit , " Tyler said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he 'd wanted to go back and find out who he 'd have been without the rodeo , the money and Shawna . This was country life , for regular folks . <p> And it was n't as if Walt had n't warned him , he thought . <p> With a grimace , Tyler pulled to the side of the road , shut the truck off and scooted underneath the pickup on his back , with damage control on his mind . Just like the bad old days , he reflected , when he and his dad , Jake , had played shade-tree mechanic in the yard at the ranch , trying to keep some piece-of-shit car running until payday . <p> Whatever Walt 's other talents might be , muffler repair was n't among them . He 'd duct-taped the part in place , and now the tape hung in smoldering shreds and the muffler looked as though somebody had peppered it with buckshot . <p> Tyler sighed , shimmied out from under the truck again and got to his feet , dusting off his jeans and trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt . Kit sat in the driver 's seat , nose smudging up the window , panting . <p> Easing the dog back so he could get his cell phone out of the dirt-crusted cup well in the truck 's console , Tyler called 411 and asked to be connected to the nearest towing outfit . <p> Lily Kenyon was n't having second thoughts about staying on in Montana to look after her ailing father as she and a nurse muscled him into her rented Taurus in front of Missoula General Hospital . She was having forty-third thoughts , seventy-eighth thoughts ; she 'd left second ones behind about half an hour after she and her six-year-old daughter , Tess , rushed into the admittance office a week before , fresh from the airport . <p> Lily had remembered her father as a good-natured if somewhat distracted man , even-tempered and funny . Until her teens , she 'd spent summers in Stillwater Springs , sticking to his heels like a wad of chewing gum as he saw four-legged patients in his veterinary clinic , trailing him from barn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horses , goats and barn cats . He 'd been kind , referring to her as his assistant and calling her " Doc Ryder , " and it had made her feel proud , because that was what folks in that small Montana community called him . <p> In those little-girl days , Lily had wanted to be just like her dad . <p> Now , though , she was having a hard time squaring the man she recalled with the one her bitter , angry mother described after the divorce . The one who never showed up on the doorstep , sent Christmas or birthday cards , or even called to ask how she was . <p> Let alone sent a plane ticket so she could visit . <p> Now , after seven long days of putting up with his crotchety ways , she understood her mom 's attitude a little better , even though it still smarted , the way Lucy Ryder Cook could never speak of her ex-husband without pursing her lips afterward . Hal Ryder , aka Doc , seemed fond of Tess , but every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled pain in his eyes . <p> Once her father and daughter were buckled in , Hal in the front and Tess in the special booster seat the law required of anyone under a certain age and height , Lily slid behind the wheel and tried to center herself . The day was hot , even for July ; the hospital had been blessedly cool , but the vents on the dashboard of the rental were still huffing out blasts of heat . <p> Sweat dampened the back of Lily 's sleeveless blouse ; without even turning a wheel , she was already sticking to the seat . <p> Not good . <p> " Can we get hamburgers ? " Tess piped from the backseat . <p> " No , " said Lily , who placed great stock in eating healthfully . <p> " Yes , " challenged her curmudgeon of a father , at exactly the same moment . <p> " Which ? " Tess inquired patiently . " Yes or no ? " The poor kid was nothing if not pragmatic  --  stoic , too . She 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke 's " accident " a year before . Lily had n't had the heart to tell her little girl what everyone else knew  --  that Burke Kenyon , Lily 's estranged husband and Tess 's father , had crashed his small private plane into a bridge on purpose , in a fit of spiteful melancholy . <p> " No , " Lily said firmly , after glaring eloquently at her dad for a moment . " You 're recovering from a heart attack , " she reminded him . " You are not supposed to eat fried food . " <p> " There 's such a thing as quality of life , you know , " Hal Ryder grumped . He looked thin , and there were bluish-gray shadows under his eyes , underlaid by pouches of skin . " And if you think I 'm going to live on tofu and sprouts until my dying day , you 'd better think again . " <p> Lily shifted the car into gear , and the tires screeched a little on the sun-softened pavement as she pulled away from the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her wit 's end from stress and lack of sleep , " if you want to clog your arteries with grease and poison your system with preservatives and God only knows what else , that 's your business . Tess and I intend to live long , healthy lives . " <p> " Long , boring lives , " Hal complained . Lily had stopped thinking of him as " Dad " years before , when it first dawned on her that he would n't be flying her out to Montana for any more small-town , barefoot-and-Popsicle summers . He had n't approved of her teenage romance with Tyler Creed , and she 'd always suspected that was part of the reason he 'd cut her out of his life . <p> " I 'd be happy to hire a nurse , " Lily said , shoving Tyler to the back of her mind and biting her lip as she navigated thickening late-morning traffic . " Tess and I can go back to Chicago if you 'd prefer . " <p> " Do n't be mean , Mom , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remember . " <p> The image of a ticker gone berserk filled Lily 's mind . If the subject had n't been so serious , she 'd have smiled . <p> " Yeah , " Hal agreed . " Do n't be mean . It reminds me of Lucy , and I like to think about her as little as possible . " <p> Since Lily was n't on much better terms with her mother than she was with Hal , she could have done without that last remark . She peeled her back from the seat and fumbled with the air-conditioning , keeping one eye on the road . Her cotton shorts had ridden up , so her thighs were stuck , too , and it would hurt to pull them free . <p> Another thing to dread . <p> " Gee , thanks , " she muttered . <p> " Nana 's a stinker , " Tess commented , her tone cheerful and affectionately tolerant . <p> " Hush , " Lily said , though she secretly agreed . " That was n't a nice thing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tess insisted . <p> " Amen , " Hal added . <p> " Enough , " Lily muttered . " Both of you . I 'm trying to drive , here . Keep us all alive . " <p> " Slow down a little , then , " Hal grumbled . " This is n't Chicago . " <p> " Do n't remind me . " Lily had n't intended to sound sarcastic , but she had . <p> " Is your house big , Grampa ? " Tess asked , bravely trying to steer the conversation onto more amiable ground . " Can I have my mom 's old room ? " <p> Lily flashed on the big , rambling Victorian that had once been her home , with its delightful nooks and crannies , its cluttered library stuffed with books , its window seats and alcoves and brick fireplaces . Remembering , she felt the loss afresh , and something squeezed at the back of her heart . <p> " You can , " Hal said , with a gentleness Lily almost envied . She felt his gaze touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man waiting in Chicago , Lily  --  is that why you want to go back ? " <p> Lily tensed , searching for the freeway on-ramp , wondering if the question had a subtext . After all , Lily 's mother had left her father for another man , and he had n't remarried during the intervening years . Maybe he mistrusted women  --  his only daughter included . <br> Continues ...
