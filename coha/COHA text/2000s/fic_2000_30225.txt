Lin Kong graduated from the military medical school toward the end of 1963 and came to Muji to work as a doctor . At that time the hospital ran a small nursing school , which offered a sixteen-month program and produced nurses for the army in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia . When Manna Wu enrolled as a student in the fall of 1964 , Lin was teaching a course in anatomy . She was an energetic young woman at the time , playing volleyball on the hospital team . Unlike most of her classmates who were recent middle- or high-school graduates , she had already served three years as a telephone operator in a coastal division and was older than most of them . Since over 95 percent of the students in the nursing school were female , many young officers from the units stationed in Muji City would frequent the hospital on weekends . Most of the officers wanted to find a girlfriend or a fiance among the students , although these young women were still soldiers and were not allowed to have a boyfriend . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female students , a reason few of them would articulate but one which they all knew in their hearts , namely that these were " good girls . " That phrase meant these women were virgins ; otherwise they could not have joined the army , since every young woman recruited had to go through a physical exam that eliminated those with a broken hymen . One Sunday afternoon in the summer , Manna was washing clothes alone in the dormitory washroom . In came a bareheaded lieutenant of slender build and medium height , his face marked with a few freckles . His collar was unbuckled and the top buttons on his jacket were undone , displaying his prominent Adam 's apple . He stood beside her , lifted his foot up , and placed it into the long terrazzo sink . The tap water splashed on his black plastic sandal and spread like a silvery fan . Done with the left foot , he put in his right . To Manna 's amusement , he bathed his feet again and again . His breath stank of alcohol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled back . Gradually they entered into conversation . He said he was the head of a radio station at the headquarters of the Muji Sub-Command and a friend of Instructor Peng . His hands shook a little as he talked . He asked where she came from ; she told him her hometown was in Shandong Province , withholding the fact that she had grown up as an orphan without a hometown  --  her parents had died in a traffic accident in Tibet when she was three . " What 's your name ? " he asked . " Manna Wu . " " I 'm Mai Dong , from Shanghai . " A lull set in . She felt her face flushing a little , so she returned to washing her clothes . But he seemed eager to go on talking . " Glad to meet you , Comrade Manna Wu , " he said abruptly and stretched out his hand . She waved to show the soapsuds on her palms . " Sorry , " she said with a pixieish smile . " By the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing his wet hands on his flanks . " It 's all right . " " Really ? Even the weather here ? " " Yes . " " Not too cold in winter ? " Before she could answer , he went on , " Of course , summer 's fine . How about  --  " " Why did you bathe your feet eight or nine times ? " She giggled . " Oh , did I ? " He seemed bewildered , looking down at his feet . " Nice sandals , " she said . " My cousin sent them from Shanghai . By the way , how old are you ? " He grinned . Surprised by the question , she looked at him for a moment and then turned away , reddening . He smiled rather naturally . " I mean , do you have a boyfriend ? " Again she was taken aback . Before she could decide how to answer , a woman student walked in with a bucket to fetch water , so their conversation had to end . A week later she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for disturbing her in the washroom and for his untidy appearance , which was n't suitable for an officer . He had asked her so many embarrassing questions , she must have taken him for an idiot . But he had not been himself that day . He begged her to forgive him . She wrote back , saying she had not been offended , instead very much amused . She appreciated his candor and natural manners . Both of them were in their mid-twenties and had never taken a lover . Soon they began to write each other a few times a week . Within two months they started their rendezvous on weekends at movie theaters , parks , and the riverbank . Mai Dong hated Muji , which was a city with a population of about a quarter of a million . He dreaded its severe winters and the north winds that came from Siberia with clouds of snow dust . The smog , which always curtained the sky when the weather was cold , aggravated his chronic sore throat . His work , transcribing and transmitting telegrams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal . Manna tried to comfort him with kind words . By nature he was weak and gentle . Sometimes she felt he was like a small boy who needed the care of an elder sister or a mother . One Saturday afternoon in the fall , they met in Victory Park . Under a weeping willow on the bank of a lake , they sat together watching a group of children on the other shore flying a large kite , which was a paper centipede crawling up and down in the air . To their right , about a hundred feet away , a donkey was tethered to a tree , now and then whisking its tail . Its master was lying on the grass and taking a nap , a green cap over his face so that flies might not bother him . Maple seeds floated down , revolving in the breeze . Furtively Mai Dong stretched out his hand , held Manna 's shoulder , and pulled her closer so as to kiss her lips . " What are you doing ? " she cried , leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mallards and geese in the water . She did n't understand his intention and thought he had attempted something indecent , like a hoodlum . She did n't remember ever being kissed by anyone . He looked puzzled , then muttered , " I did n't mean to make you angry like this . " " Do n't ever do that again . " " All right , I wo n't . " He turned away from her and looked piqued , spitting on the grass . From then on , though she did n't reproach him again , she resisted his advances resolutely , her sense of virtue and honor preventing her from succumbing to his desire . Her resistance kindled his passion . Soon he told her that he could n't help thinking of her all the time , as though she had become his shadow . Sometimes at night , he would walk alone in the compound of the Sub-Command headquarters for hours , with his 1951 pistol stuck in his belt . Heaven knew how he missed her and how many nights he remained awake tossing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proposed to her two months before her graduation . He wanted to marry her without delay . She thought he must have lost his mind , though by now she also could n't help thinking of him for an hour or two every night . Her head ached in the morning , her grades were suffering , and she was often angry with herself . She would lose her temper with others for no apparent reason . When nobody was around , tears often came to her eyes . For all their love , an immediate marriage would be impracticable , out of the question . She was uncertain where she would be sent when she graduated , probably to a remote army unit , which could be anywhere in Manchuria or Inner Mongolia . Besides , a marriage at this moment would suggest that she was having a love affair ; this would invite punishment , the lightest of which the school would administer was to keep the couple as separate as possible . In recent years the leaders had assigned some lovers to different places deliberately . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lin Kong , who was known as a good-hearted married man and was regarded by many students as a kind of elder brother . In such a situation she needed an objective opinion . Lin agreed that a marriage at this moment was unwise , and that they had better wait a while until her graduation and then decide what to do . He promised he would let nobody know of the relationship . In addition , he said he would try to help her in the job assignment if he was involved in making the decision . She reasoned Mai Dong out of the idea of an immediate marriage and assured him that she would become his wife sooner or later . As graduation approached , they both grew restless , hoping she would remain in Muji City . He was depressed , and his despondency made her love him more . At the graduation she was assigned to stay in the hospital and work in its Medical Department as a nurse  --  a junior officer of the twenty-fourth rank . The good news , however , did n't please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he was informed that his radio station was going to be transferred to a newly formed regiment in Fuyuan County , almost eighty miles northeast of Muji and very close to the Russian border . " Do n't panic , " she told him . " Work and study hard on the front . I 'll wait for you . " Though also heartbroken , she felt he was a rather pathetic man . She wished he were stronger , a man she could rely on in times of adversity , because life always had unexpected misfortunes . " When will we get married ? " he asked . " Soon , I promise . " Despite saying that , she was unsure whether he would be able to come back to Muji . She preferred to wait a while . The nearer the time for departure drew , the more embittered Mai Dong became . A few times he mentioned he would rather be demobilized and return to Shanghai , but she dissuaded him from considering that . A discharge might send him to a place far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads in the interior of China . It was better for them to stay as close as possible . When she saw him off at the front entrance of the Sub-Command headquarters , she had to keep blowing on her fingers , having forgotten to bring along her mittens . She would n't take the fur gloves he offered her ; she said he would need them more . He stood at the back door of the radio van , whose green body had turned gray with encrusted ice and snow . The radio antenna atop the van was tilting in the wind , which , with a shrill whistle , again and again tried to snatch it up and bear it off . More snow was falling , and the air was piercingly cold . Mai Dong 's breath hung around his face as he shouted orders to his soldiers in the van , who gathered at the window , eager to see what Manna looked like . Outside the van , a man loaded into a side trunk some large wooden blocks needed for climbing the slippery mountain roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tire chains were securely fastened . His fur hat was completely white , a nest of snowflakes . As the van drew away , Mai Dong waved good-bye to Manna , his hand stretching through the back window , as though struggling to pull her along . He wanted to cry , " Wait for me , Manna ! " but he dared not get that out in the presence of his men . Seeing his face contort with pain , Manna 's eyes blurred with tears . She bit her lips so as not to cry . Winter in Muji was long . Snow would n't disappear until early May . In mid-April when the Songhua River began to break up , people would gather at the bank watching the large blocks of ice cracking and drifting in the blackish-green water . Teenage boys , baskets in hand , would tread and hop on the floating ice , picking up pike , whitefish , carp , baby sturgeon , and catfish killed by the ice blocks that had been washed down by spring torrents . Steamboats , still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the main channel was finally clear of ice , they crept out , sailing slowly up and down the river and saluting the spectators with long blasts . Children would hail and wave at them . Then spring descended all of a sudden . Aspen catkins flew in the air , so thick that when walking on the streets you could breathe them in and you would flick your hand to keep them away from your face . The scent of lilac blooms was pungent and intoxicating . Yet old people still wrapped themselves in fur or cotton-padded clothes . The dark earth , vast and loamy , marked by tufts of yellow grass here and there , began emitting a warm vapor that flickered like purple smoke in the sunshine . All at once apricot and peach trees broke into blossoms , which grew puffy as bees kept touching them . Within two weeks the summer started . Spring was so short here that people would say Muji had only three seasons . In her letters to Mai Dong , Manna described these seasonal changes as though he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained in his letters about life at the front . Many soldiers there suffered from night blindness because they had n't eaten enough vegetables . They all had lice in their underclothes since they could n't take baths in their barracks . For the whole winter and spring he had seen only two movies . He had lost fourteen pounds , he was like a skeleton now . To comfort him , each month Manna mailed him a small bag of peanut brittle . One evening in June , Manna and two other nurses were about to set out for the volleyball court behind the medical building . Benping , the soldier in charge of mail and newspapers , came and handed her a letter . Seeing it was from Mai Dong , her teammates teased her , saying , " Aha , a love letter . " She opened the envelope and was shocked while reading through the two pages . Mai Dong told her that he could n't stand the life on the border any longer and had applied for a discharge , which had been granted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milder and the food better . More heartrending , he had decided to marry his cousin , who was a salesgirl at a department store in Shanghai . Without such a marriage , he would n't be able to obtain a residence card , which was absolutely necessary for him to live and find employment in the metropolis . In reality he and the girl had been engaged even before he had applied for his discharge ; otherwise he would n't have been allowed to go to Shanghai , since he was not from the city proper but from one of its suburban counties . He was sorry for Manna and asked her to hate and forget him . Her initial response was long silence . " Are you okay ? " Nurse Shen asked . Manna nodded and said nothing . Then the three of them set out for the game . On the volleyball court Manna , usually an indifferent player , struck the ball with such ferocity that for the first time her comrades shouted " Bravo " for her . Her face was smeared with sweat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she fell flat on the graveled court and scraped her right elbow . The spectators applauded the diving save while she slowly picked herself up and found blood oozing from her skin . During the break her teammates told her to go to the clinic and have the injury dressed , so she left , planning to return for the second game . But on her way , she changed her mind and ran back to the dormitory . She merely washed her elbow with cold water and did n't bandage it . Once alone in the bedroom , she read the letter again and tears gushed from her eyes . She flung the pages down on the desk and fell on her bed , sobbing , twisting , and biting the pillowcase . A mosquito buzzed above her head , then settled on her neck , but she did n't bother to slap it . She felt as if her heart had been pierced . When her three roommates came back at nine , she was still in tears . They picked up the letter and glanced through it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . But their words made her sob harder and even convulsively . That night she did n't wash her face or brush her teeth . She slept with her clothes on , waking now and then and weeping quietly while her roommates wheezed or smacked their lips or murmured something in their sleep . She simply could n't stop her tears . She was ill for a few weeks . She felt aged , in deep lassitude and numb despair , and regretted not marrying Mai Dong before he left for the front . Her limbs were weary , as though separated from herself . Despite her comrades ' protests , she dropped out of the volleyball team , saying she was too sick to play . She spent more time alone , as though all at once she belonged to an older generation ; she cared less about her looks and clothes . By now she was almost twenty-six , on the verge of becoming an old maid , whose standard age was twenty-seven to most people 's minds . The hospital had three old maids ; Manna seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was slim and tall and looked natural ; besides , she had a pleasant voice . In normal circumstances she would n't have had difficulty in finding a boyfriend , but the hospital always kept over a hundred women nurses , most of whom were around twenty , healthy and normal , so young officers could easily find girlfriends among them . As a result , few men were interested in Manna . Only an enlisted soldier paid her some attentions . He was a cook , a squat man from Szechwan Province , and he would dole out to her a larger portion of a dish when she bought her meal . But she did not want an enlisted soldier as a boyfriend , which would have violated the rule that only officers could have a girlfriend or a boyfriend . Besides , that man looked awful  --  owlish and cunning . So she avoided standing in any line leading to his window .
