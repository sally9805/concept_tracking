MANNISH BOY 1913-1925 // Muddy Waters usually told people he was born in Rolling Fork , Mississippi . That 's in Sharkey County , the lower quarter of the Mississippi Delta . Rolling Fork was where the train stopped , where Muddy 's family would get their mail and do their shopping . Rolling Fork was on the map . But Muddy 's actual birthplace is to the west and north of there , in the next county over-Issaquena , pronounced " Essaquena , " the initial " e " the only thing soft in this hard land . // Berta Grant , Muddy 's mother , lived next to the Cottonwood Plantation , at a bend in the road known as Jug 's Corner . It was a tiny settlement in the shadow of the Mississippi 's levee , a cluster of shacks and cabins undistinguished from most others in the Mississippi Delta . Among locals , however , Jug 's Corner was well known : they had the fish fries on Saturday nights . // At Jug 's Corner , and throughout the Delta , farmhands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the land did n't swallow them , the river did n't drink them , the boss man did n't kill them , and the mud , a half step from the dust and ashes from whence they came , did not engulf them . // Muddy 's father , Ollie Morganfield , used to attend those Jug 's Corner frolics . Ollie was from the Magnolia Plantation on Steele Bayou , two miles between Jug 's Corner and Rolling Fork . Big boned and handsome , he could entertain with a guitar . " Ollie could play good blues , " said one long-lived resident of Issaquena County . " He 'd go around , folks would get him to play at a party . Dark , tall , real friendly . Full faced . Sing ? He used to holler . Played old-timey blues . " // " I 've heard them say that a party did n't brighten up until Ollie appeared , " recalled his son Robert Morganfield , Muddy 's half brother . " He would sing , blow a jug , play guitar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , with brown eyes and black hair . Born October 20 , 1890 , he was twenty-one the summer of 1912 , already the father of one child though separated from his wife . // Berta-probably Alberta or Roberta , but called Berta by everyone - lived with her younger brother Joe and their mother , Della Grant . Berta was a young girl the summer she conceived her only child . There is no record of Berta 's birth or death , no one left alive who knew her . If she was counted in any census , she has eluded researchers . Like Jug 's Corner , she was off the map , a cipher around which scant information is collected : Berta was born between 1893 and 1901 . Her mother , Della-Muddy 's grandmother , a plump , light-skinned woman-was born in 1881 , so Muddy 's grandmother was all of thirty-two years old when Muddy was born in 1913 . ( Generations came quick in Muddy 's family : his own granddaughter was thirteen when she first conceived ; Muddy 's response was , " Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berta 's party that summer 's eve ( probably the July 4 weekend ) , and the next spring , on April 4 , 1913 , Berta-at least twelve years old , but less than twenty-gave birth to a boy . ( It was , despite what would later be sung , neither the seventh hour nor the seventh day ; it was not the seventh month and there were not seven doctors . But like the lyrics to " Hoochie Coochie Man " suggest , Muddy did seem born for good luck , he did make pretty women jump and shout , and everybody knew that blues and sex were what Muddy Waters was all about . ) Though his parents never married , the child was given his father 's last name : McKinley A. Morganfield. // In years to come , after he moved to Chicago , Muddy usually told people he was born in 1915 , oddly shaving only two years off his age ( if his goal was to appear younger for the entertainment field ) . He thus became a man born in a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't born , carrying a name he was n't born with . // The Morganfield name was relatively new to the Jug 's Corner area . The Delta had been a swampy jungle of wildcats and bears when David Morganfield , Muddy 's grandfather , arrived from Birmingham , Alabama at the turn of the twentieth century . His wife had died and he carried with him three sons , Ollie , Eddie , and Lewis . Birmingham must have offered very little , for the family left the city and moved to the poorest region in the nation 's poorest state . // David Morganfield was a man of some heft , and he found work in Issaquena County as an ox driver . " I 've heard people say he was the only man they ever saw turn a team of oxen away from water when they get hot , " said Robert Morganfield . " They say up here from the town of Glen Allan , he was hauling some logs and those oxen was hot and saw Lake Washington and started for it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't , he was good with a whip-they tell me he could put one to the ground with the whip- and he turned them around . " // Ollie , the eldest son , found work as a mule skinner , hauling logs from cleared land to a groundhog sawmill in the woods and sometimes more than forty miles to the large mill in Vicksburg . As it was cleared , the richness of the Delta 's alluvial soil revealed itself . The Mississippi Delta is a large bowl that runs from Memphis south to Vicksburg , bounded by the Yazoo River to the east and the Mississippi River to the west . It is North America 's mulch basin , the dumping ground for the mighty Mississippi River 's deposit of fish and animal bones , decomposing trees , and topsoil from mountaintops in the north central states-the erosion of a continent . It is sixty-five hundred square miles of mellow , black , loamy soil , centuries in the making and much of it more than a hundred feet deep . A flood plain , the Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial mounds-sites on which the earliest white settlers established their homes . Once the levee system was finished in the early twentieth century , landowners became rich . Vast plantations were established , many of which are still maintained by the original families , thousands and thousands of acres spread over dirt so blessed and smooth that locals refer to it as ice cream soil . // In the Mississippi Delta , cotton determined the rich and the poor , the poor and the poorest . It determined who had butter with their bread , when school was in session , and what weeks men would stay up late and get up early . Break the land , plow , plant , cultivate , pick , gin ; the plant dictated how a man spent his day , his season , his life . King Cotton . // The cotton plant is a perennial , and it would grow forever-become a tree-but for the frost , the freeze , and the floods . ( Before plant control through chemicals , cotton grew over six feet tall . ) Mississippi cotton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the river waters have settled . When the plants begin to sprout , the cotton is chopped ; row by cold steel row , the Johnson grass and morning glory vine that can choke the plant are hoed from around it and the plants are thinned . Come midsummer , the cotton plants flower , and the farmer knows the harvest will begin in fifty days . The next weeks are less labor intensive , the lay-by , when churches hold mass baptisms , doctors tend to the sick , and the healthy tend to the farm errands and the business of partying. // Cotton is green when it opens , and weighty . The longer it sits , the drier it becomes , and less weight equals less pay . The bolls nearest the ground open first , and field hands would pick every opened boll of cotton , then come back and pick again . Cotton sacks were seven to nine feet long and held about a hundred pounds . They strapped over the shoulder , the mouth hanging open , so in one fluid motion the boll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . Some could fill five . Harvesters worked from sun to sun ; they did n't need hands on a watch . Like all of them-his father , his mother ( about whom so little else is known ) , his brothers , sisters , cousins , and friends-Muddy Waters picked cotton . On someone else 's land . // The sharecropper . Also called the tenant farmer . When sharecropping was conceived during Reconstruction , the noble idea was to empower the poor laborer with the responsibility of land , for which he would pay the landowner with a portion of what he raised . But landowners had other designs , indenturing their help through crafty accounting and debt . Working as a sharecropper was like being knocked to the ground every time you started to stand up . // According to the office manager at Stovall Farms , the plantation where Muddy was raised , " The fairness of what the sharecropper got was strictly based on the moral fiber of that particular plantation owner . No two landowners did it the same way . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish . " That included a cut of land ( ten or so acres ) and a tenant house on that land ; field hands stepped out the back door and went to work , wasting no time with travel . The furnish included seed , tools , mules , and credit at the plantation store . // The sharecropper , in return , gave the landowner half of his harvest and then had his expenses deducted from what remained . Prices at the plantation store were often set arbitrarily high . Fees were assessed over which the ' cropper had no control . Most did not have the mathematical or literacy skills to challenge the accounting . Settlement came at Christmas , and Delta farmers still tell of one landowner who invited each ' cropper individually into his office , served bonded whiskey from his good glassware , then asked the farmer whether he wanted to take home a thin check or run his hands through a tub of silver dollars and carry home an armload. // A plantation was a privately owned small town , and its owners generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been entitled to . Many farms minted their own tin scrip- " brozine " - good only at their store . Some provided regular visits from a doctor . Each had its own moonshiner . The Stovall Plantation built a juke joint for its workers-right next to the commissary , which supplied it ; the farm got its cut of everything . The nearby Dockery Plantation maintained a brothel for its men . The furnish meant you would n't die ; a good boss meant comfort , a chance at solvency , possibly progress . Families too far in debt fled a plantation in the cover of night . Those caught bought a trip to the company store , the site of plantation justice : a farmer wearing a big hat , meting out beatings. // Do n't cross the boss . That was the guiding principle for the sharecropper . Stay in your place , laugh at his jokes , and you could reap the benefits-a warning of an imminent moonshine bust , a better handout from the kitchen when making a delivery at the big house . Sharecropping put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfworth ; debt was so arbitrary and constant , it did n't matter if he got ahead . // Sharecropping-getting less than half of what you 've got coming to you-was good training for a life in the music business . The tenuousness of the sharecropper 's life was reflected in the geography itself . Flooding often and suddenly , bringing death or crop ruin-a slower death-the Mississippi River inflicted punishment with its discharge . But it also brought life , the rich topsoil , the loam , the minerals and decay that replenished the strength that man sapped through cotton farming . Like everyone that lived so closely to and so closely off of the land , Della Grant knew these truths as well as she knew the layout of her small home . She lost her daughter , McKinley 's mother , soon after he was born . No one knows what killed Berta- childbed fever , a neglected cut , or an incautious walk through the night woods . Some sort of waters rose , then receded , and she was gone . It was left to Della @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her son Joe , three years Muddy 's senior . // When her beloved grandson , now her son , took to playing in the dangerous waters that were everywhere around Jug 's Corner , Della tried to stop him . ( The Mississippi Delta drains south and east , making the Issaquena and Sharkey counties the marshiest . ) Knowing that something could carry him off as quickly and as surely as her own Berta was carried off , Della assumed what little power she could . She put the danger and dankness and mystery and life of those shallow brumal fluids into a name the boy would carry through his life . She renamed him Muddy , as if by claiming the Mississippi 's cruel and divine identity for this child she would somehow neuter its power . // ( It would be years later , when he was establishing himself as a performer , that his friends would add " Water " to his name , and the final " s " would come in Chicago when McKinley 's transformation was complete. ) // Della struggled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the authors of Beale Black and Blue in the mid- 1970s , " she furnished for me and my uncle . She was a woman , she did n't know how to get out there and hustle as good as some men . I know I got up one Christmas morning and we did n't have nothing to eat . We did n't have a apple , we did n't have a orange , we did n't have a cake , we did n't have nothing . " // Eventually Della Grant moved with her son and grandson eighty miles north to Stovall , in Coahoma County , a six-mile walk northwest of Clarksdale . Exactly when Della moved to Stovall is not known ( probably when Muddy was between the ages of six months and three years ) , but by March 6 , 1920 , she was there to answer the census taker 's questions . A large plantation-four thousand acres- with a kindly reputation , Stovall was home to Della 's cousins , the Dan " Duke " Jones family ; Ollie Morganfield 's two brothers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue contact , devoting himself to his next wife and their ten children . " I never did see my dad when I was living on Stovall , " said Muddy . " I did n't see him at all . " // Tenant homes throughout the Delta followed a standard boxy design . And plantation owners treated the dwellings like the dwellers : as a group , units for a prosperous whole . They painted them all at once , and all one color-usually green or brown , trimmed in white . Most were two big rooms . Della 's cabin ( Route 1 , Box 84 ) had begun as a single room built from hand-hewn cypress planks by a hunter before the Civil War . By the time she occupied it , a kitchen and two more small rooms had been added . Tenant houses had neither running water nor electricity . Mattresses were ticks-fabric stuffed with cotton bolls and cotton shuck that had to be fluffed before sleeping and smoothed after waking . Water was hand pumped , and pumps had to be primed , which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " coal oil " ) lamps . Women sometimes mopped the wooden floors with lye and hot water to make them white . //
