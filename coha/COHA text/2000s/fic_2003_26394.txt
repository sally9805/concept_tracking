Friday , November 30 8:30 A.M. " I 'm going to take my hand off your mouth if you promise not to scream . Do you understand ? " I nod my head , which bangs into the man 's chin . He grunts in a low and manly fashion . I ca n't see him clearly , because we are both lying on the floor of my closet . Well , I am lying on the floor . He is lying on top of me , his hand braced to keep some of his weight off my chest , but there is nothing he can do about our lower halves , which are sandwiched together like peanut butter and jelly . Something is digging into my thigh , but I ca n't tell if it 's animal , vegetable or mineral . " Excuse me , but I think your wrench is ... " " Shh . " The man puts his hand back over my mouth , a callused hand , I note , though whether from building birdcages or burying dead bodies I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of shuffle-thump , shuffle-thump . Somebody is dragging something just outside this closet . My heart kicks into a faster rhythm . I feel the tension of the man 's long muscles all along my lower body . He has a quality of trained alertness , of coiled energy held in check . Like a Labrador about to seize a bird , I think , and suddenly realize that this thought holds insight as to the identity of the manwith his hand on my mouth . Labrador , retrieving , the ability to hold something large in your teeth without biting down ... Something wet drips onto my hand and at first I think it is water from the broken pipe , but then I see that the liquid is dark , and draining from the man 's shoulder . " You 're bleeding . " " And you 're talking . " His voice is low and rough and suggests all manner of pleasurable punishments . " Ford ? Is that you ? " I see his eyes glint with something - exasperation ? Affection ? And then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank ... " Mommy . Mommmy . Mom ! " Hold that last thought . " What is it , Sadie ? " " You 're making me peanut butter and jelly and I had that yesterday ! " I 'll admit that school lunches are the sort of thing I prepare on automatic pilot , thereby freeing the rest of my mental faculties to wander where they will . Still , I thought I 'd given her cheese . " I thought I gave you cheese . " Behind my daughter 's purple spectacles , I see her eyes glint with something - exasperation ? Amusement ? Then she folds her arms together . " No , I asked you for cheese . You gave me peanut butter and jelly . " I look at the time . Eight forty . " Sorry , sweetheart . It 's so late already , do you think you could just ... " My husband wanders into the kitchen , tying his long hair back in a ponytail . That and the tiny gold hoop in his left ear are all that remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponytail , the earring , and me . " She 's going to be late again , " he comments , then wanders out with his habitual air of dissatisfaction . I think of Turgenev 's reference to middle age as that " vague , crepuscular time , the time of regrets that resemble hopes , of hopes that resemble regrets . " I know better than to quote old Russian writers out loud , however . What is charming in a twenty-three-year-old who does n't wear underwear and keeps vodka in her East Village fridge is less so in a thirty-five-year-old who keeps forgetting to buy the right brand of oat bran . I go into the bedroom to get dressed and find my husband trying on a black cowboy hat . It conceals his receding hairline in a manner both attractive and sinister . " What do you think ? " " Both attractive and sinister . " I rummage in the laundry basket , which is filled with clean clothing I have not put away yet . At least I think it 's clean . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you half an hour to find a pair of underwear , and Sadie would n't get a stomachache because she needs another late pass . " I stop rummaging . " I 'm taking Sadie today ? I thought you said you were taking her . " My husband removes his hat and narrows his eyes . " I said I could n't take her , Del . I have a big meeting today . " " Okay , no problem , I 'll just throw on a long coat over my pj 's . " But my long coat , as it turns out , is at the dry cleaners . Dressed in a pea coat that only covers me down to my pajama-clad knees , I head for the door . " Sadie , we 're ready now . " " Mom , did you put my lunch in my backpack ? " " Of course I did . " Not . I slip it in while she 's not looking . We find Jason holding the elevator for us . " Hurry up , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better when Hilda gets back from vacation . " " You do n't need a housekeeper . You need a schedule . " " Jason , there 's no way I can keep house , volunteer at Sadie 's school and work freelance without some outside help . " " Sure you can . You just need to plan ahead . Sadie 's too old for a nanny , anyway , are n't you , punkin ? " He ruffles Sadie 's hair , which she detests . " I like Hilda . " " Well , we can talk about this later . " We stand together silently , as the ancient elevator door shudders to a close . I imagine this as a scene from a movie : Probably something Swedish or German , black-and-white , the kind of film where the child begins to imagine a huge , invisible dragon of parental tension blowing brimstone . Atonal piano chords on the soundtrack . I clear my throat . " So what are you doing today , Jason ? " " Big meeting today with this cowboy-hat company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene products .
