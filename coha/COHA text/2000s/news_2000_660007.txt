<p> In the hamlet of Binalong , population 250 , sheep are often the nearest neighbors . Nobody worries when kids ride their bikes around the center of town - a cluster of pub , post office , and general store . With only 36 children , the primary school feels like an extended family . But living in a rural area of the state of New South Wales has its disadvantages . The school qualifies as economically disadvantaged and receives some federal aid . It can afford a field trip to Sydney or Canberra only every other year , despite the fact that the cities are within a few hours ' drive . So getting hooked up to the Internet earlier this year - and instantly having access to the kinds of resources that city kids take for granted - was no small thing . Up to one-third of Australian children live in rural or remote settings - areas that have seen a persistent academic achievement gap when compared with more-urban schools . Hopes are high that computer technology can help rural schools narrow that chasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-town schools have the flexibility and leadership to be innovators - reshaping teaching methods to best tap technology 's potential . " There 's nothing intrinsically valuable about the Internet or computers ... but what makes them valuable is how they are taken up by teachers , " says Debra Hayes , a researcher and lecturer at the University of Technology , Sydney . That 's why efforts are under way across Australia to boost training and technical support . " All schools are undergoing a battle of change at the moment , " says David Nosworthy , principal of the Binalong Public School . With a master 's degree combining computer science and education , Mr. Nosworthy has been keen to integrate new technology into his classrooms . Through a combination of government funding and community decisions to make technology a priority , the school has 1 computer for every 5 students ( compared with a statewide goal of 1 to 11 ) . Nosworthy has also helped other schools get wired , build Web pages , and make the most of the new technologies . <p> A tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote areas . Concerns about access to quality education there are strong enough to have prompted an inquiry by the national Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission . In the report , issued last March , students said they did n't have a wide enough range of subjects to study . And teachers complained that the lack of technical support translates into slow connections to the Internet or long delays when systems need repair . In 1998 , 67 percent of urban students finished high school , compared with 63 percent of rural students and 54 percent of remote . Among other things , the report recommends that school systems review availability of videoconferencing and other interactive technologies and that regional education offices provide IT support . Australia has long tapped communications technology for " distance education . " In 1951 , the first School of the Air started offering classes over two-way radios to kids on outback cattle stations . While the radio is still the primary source of these classes , it 's slowly giving way to online courses and satellite videoconferencing . The vast majority of nonurban children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . But because their schools often are n't big enough to have more than two teachers , some of their needs fall under the distance-education umbrella . In New South Wales , for instance , a group of consultants come together periodically at the distance-education headquarters near Sydney to discuss problems and " best practices " in the small rural schools in their regions . Through this Country Area Program ( CAP ) , teachers get help with everything from joining online discussion groups with colleagues to overseeing students ' work on Web-based learning modules . The " Maths on the Net " project , for instance , teams up rural students from all over the state to work together solving math problems . " We 're trying to encourage teachers to look at developing critical-thinking skills with their students - to get kids to be challenged by gathering and analyzing information , " explains Liz Sweeney , a CAP consultant . Another online lesson focused on Antarctica . Instead of simply copying information from the Internet , students planned a hypothetical expedition . In addition to connecting with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to global cyberspace exchanges . Nosworthy hopes his students will soon be able to videoconference with a school in another country . Whatever the strategy , the point is to " ameliorate the effects of geographic isolation , " says CAP manager Graeme Smith . <p> Kids jump into the deep end There are no national or statewide requirements as to what computer skills students should master grade by grade . " Desirable outcomes change so rapidly , " Nosworthy explains . Two or three years ago , he could barely have imagined the kinds of projects the kids do now . " I 've really put them in the deep end , and it shows what they can do , " he adds as he oversees several clusters of fourth- , fifth- , and sixth-graders creating multimedia presentations . ( In addition to being principal , he 's also one of only two full-time teachers . ) After appealing to Nosworthy to quiet the room , a pair of boys tilt their heads toward a computer and say " space exploration " in sync . They seem at ease as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks earlier , " they did n't want to hear their voices back , " Nosworthy says with a proud grin . Meanwhile , Shane Blair is temporarily stymied in his efforts to research Halley 's Comet , because the Internet connection is down . He has a computer at home , he says , but he especially enjoys using the Internet at school because " it 's really quick on iMACs . It 's fun to use and you can go on there on lunch hours . " The latest Internet research the students are engrossed in is the history of A.B . " Banjo " Paterson , a famous Australian poet who wrote " Waltzing Matilda . " The project hits even closer to home because Nosworthy recently learned that in the early 1870s , Paterson attended school in Binalong ( pronounced byne-a-long ) . In another classroom , the five- , six- , and seven-year-olds share two personal computers under the watchful eye of teacher Lynn Kane . " Every day the computer is in use , " says Ms. Kane . " I do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kane finds ways to slip technology into other activities , too . " The children yesterday were doing constructions on the floor , and they wanted to show everyone , so I got the digital camera . " The students were thrilled to see their images appear almost instantly on the computer screen . Rather than learning on computers in a separate lab , Binalong students move easily between desk work and multimedia tasks on the computers a few feet away . " That sort of seamless transition is a fairly good indicator of integration , " and of computers being used to enhance learning , says Ms. Hayes of the University of Technology . The school 's new iBook laptop , which can float from room to room through a wireless Internet connection , makes that transition even more seamless . Parents in Binalong are happy to have a school that 's keeping up to date with technology . Robyn Sykes , who has two sons at the school , says services in Binalong and other small towns are being cut back , " so the computer is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her husband use the Internet for accessing more-reliable weather reports , generated outside of Australia . But the school offers her sons much more sophisticated software than they have at home . <p> On course - on the Web There 's a similar enthusiasm for computers and the Internet in Galong , the next town over , where Nosworthy used to be principal . The K-6 school has only nine students this year , and just as many computers . While Judith Hall , the principal and main teacher , works with the younger children on a noncomputer lesson , two older students follow a CD-ROM tutorial about government in the next room . " The children are very confident with technology and very supportive of each other , " Ms. Hall says . The school 's use of computers reassures parents about the quality of the education there , she adds . " Some people have the impression that rural schools do n't give a globally competitive education . I think that 's a misconception . " The advantage of being in a small town like Galong is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology . Hall is pleased to be able to form good relationships with parents as they visit the school to use everything from laminators to the Internet . <p> E-mail teichers@csps.com . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 .
