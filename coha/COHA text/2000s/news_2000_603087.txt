<p> NEWPORT BEACH , Calif.  --  Perhaps Dick Vermeil knows some super secret Corporate America desperately needs to know , too . <p> He , after all , is the guy who coached the St. Louis Rams to a Super Bowl win in January , even though the team sucked wind the season before . <p> A lesson for Corporate America ? Lincoln-Mercury thinks so . It paid Vermeil $ 35,000  --  and a first-class plane ticket  --  to speak to its troubled California dealers group here last week . That 's $ 30,000 more than Vermeil 's payday for a corporate speech four years ago . Some difference a heart-stopping Super Bowl win makes . <p> Vermeil is a member of the fastest-growing brand of corporate motivator : the coach consultant . During their off seasons or after retirement , many of the USA 's most familiar coaches step out of team training rooms and into some of the nation 's most exclusive boardrooms and lecture halls . <p> Clearly , the effects of the red-hot economy have spilled into corporate meeting rooms . Why bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fistful of dollars , no less than the winning Super Bowl coach can lecture your sales team on how to motivate employees or win new customers ? But talk is n't cheap when it comes to snaring big-shot coaches . <p> Miami Heat coach Pat Riley earns at least $ 50,000 for each corporate speech . Ditto for Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino . Former Notre Dame and current University of South Carolina football coach Lou Holtz gets $ 36,500 . Former Los Angeles Dodgers manager and current executive Tommy Lasorda earns $ 35,000 . Former New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka gets about $ 25,000 . <p> Pat Summitt , head coach of the Lady Volunteers , the wildly successful women 's basketball team at the University of Tennessee , just raised her speaking fees to $ 20,000 . She is one of a few females in the circuit . Industry executives say there are even fewer African-American coaches or managers in this elite club of highly paid speakers . But growing demand for coaches as corporate speakers might soon change that . <p> All this is turning the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Just two decades ago , sports figures had virtually no stake in it . Today , the sports-talk business is a $ 500 million annual talk-a-thon , industry executives estimate . <p> Is any coach worth $ 50,000 for an hour pep talk  --  followed by , perhaps , 30 minutes of autographs ? Not everyone thinks so . " You need time to change people , not just a one-hour speech , " says Robert Butterworth , a corporate psychologist . " The only time you can be in a room with someone for one hour and get your $ 50,000 worth is when that person is a brain surgeon and you 're the patient . " <p> No one says corporate speaking is brain surgery . The hottest member of this coaches-as-speakers club is Vermeil . His mission last week : convince 200 auto dealers they can pull off the same one-in-a-million turnaround that he did with the Rams . <p> Since winning the Super Bowl , Vermeil has had more than 100 speaking engagement offers , says Marc Reede , president of the Beverly Hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he has agreed to only a handful . <p> On the day of his first corporate speaking engagement in nearly four years , Vermeil is uncharacteristically nervous . He meets a USA TODAY reporter for a breakfast of hot oatmeal and cold orange juice and discusses his jitters . <p> " I 've never believed what I had to say is worth a lot of money , " he says , fidgeting with the runner-up Super Bowl ring he won in 1981 when he coached the Philadelphia Eagles . " But if someone else believes it is , well , that 's OK by me . " <p> Coaches Riley and Pitino have published books about how to win . Vermeil has n't . But the retired coach pulls out an 87-page unbound book of his thoughts on winning . He gave copies of it to every player , and he pulls material for his speeches from it . He tells athletes and executives alike , " Winning is n't complicated . People complicate it . " Indeed they do . <p> While car and truck sales grew 11% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low single-digits . " Vermeil did a hell of a job with a team that had no expectations of winning , " says Jim Splendore , a Lincoln-Mercury marketing executive in California . " Maybe he can get our dealers to stretch . " <p> The speech <p> Vermeil is introduced as " the master of revitalization . " <p> He tries to talk the talk of a car guy . He tells them he knows cars because his dad ran a car repair shop . He tells them he was formerly a Cadillac spokesman . He tells them that the first new car his parents bought was a 1950 Mercury . <p> " Your problems are greater than any problems I had trying to build a football team , " he says . " You have to worry about imports . I did n't . " <p> That gets a laugh . <p> Vermeil is on a roll now . He decides to junk his canned speech  --  even telling the audience that 's exactly what he 's doing . He gets touchy-feely , offering tips on how these dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care , they 'll care , " he says . " If you believe , they 'll believe , " he adds . Then , in trademark Vermeil style , he looks up at a captive audience and says , " If you cry , they 'll cry . " <p> When the speech ends 28 minutes later , every dealer in the room stands and applauds . But the question-and-answer session is n't about business or how to manage . There are eight questions  - -  every one about the Super Bowl game he won . <p> Before Vermeil leaves the room , the autograph seekers pounce . Among them is Patrick Rodgers , a regional manager who fetches an autograph for his nephew , Graham . <p> After enough hands are shaken and autographs signed , Vermeil is whisked away in a limo . Next on his speaking agenda : Fidelity Investments , Lexus and Anheuser-Busch . And a meet-and-greet session with PricewaterhouseCoopers executives in June , where he 'll earn $ 35,000 , mostly for pressing the flesh . <p> Here 's how four other top-draw coaches do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Miami Heat is regarded as the sports world 's top motivational speaker . But he knows his limits . " There 's no way any speaker can come in for one hour and do anything other than raise some pulse rates , " says Riley . <p> It takes more . That 's why Miller Brewing pays Riley to speak to its sales force several times annually . During the year , it often features Riley 's image in internal e-mail . Riley even has recorded motivational phone messages that go to the sales staff . <p> How to keep the audience focused on business instead of basketball ? During the question-and-answer period , " I ask the company to plant four or five real good questions , " says Riley . " Then , I try answer them with good business analogies . " <p> * Dan Reeves . The Atlanta Falcons head coach figures he makes more money giving speeches than he did playing football . Speeches last year earned him $ 500,000 . <p> He made much of that from Merck , the drugmaker for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heart surgery in late 1998 , promotes the cholesterol-reducing drug Zocor . Merck flies Reeves around the country to speak to groups of doctors and heart patients . He also has given pep talks to Merck 's top executives . <p> Reeves recently raised his fees . " I spend a lot of time away from home during the season , " he explains . " So , you have to ask yourself : ' What is it worth for you to be away from your wife during the off-season ? ' " <p> Heart , desire , guts <p> * Mike Ditka . Few speakers inspire corporate audiences like the recently fired coach of the New Orleans Saints  --  even though his record since 1997 was a miserable 14-32 . He did lead the Chicago Bears to a Super Bowl victory in 1986 . <p> Ditka gives about 25 corporate speeches annually . Recent ones were to top executives at Motorola and United Van Lines . He talks about team building . But he does n't pretend his words can change much . " Motivation is a very overused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . It 's called heart , desire and guts . That 's nothing I can give someone else . " <p> * Pat Summitt . Although Summitt , head coach of the women 's basketball team at the University of Tennessee , gets dozens of requests annually to speak , she accepts only five gigs a year . <p> Just as with basketball games , she tapes each speech she gives , studies them , then tries to improve . " Not many people yawn when I talk , " she says . " I tend to be as emotional and intense as a speaker as I am as a coach . " <p> She recently spoke to the Federal Reserve Board  --  with Alan Greenspan in attendance . " I still get nervous when I speak to business groups , " she says . " I 'm out of my arena . " <p> Vermeil knows how she feels . But on this day , nerves do n't affect the final score . He wins this one easily . <p> Near an overflowing fountain outside the ballroom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speech they just heard from Vermeil . <p> " I rely on Ford to inspire me with speakers like this , " says Mike Johnson , owner of a Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Lancaster , Calif . " If every dealer sells one-tenth of a car more after hearing this speech , we got our money 's worth . " <p> Talk is n't cheap <p> Here 's what industry experts estimate the nation 's most familiar coaches and managers are paid for a one-hour speech to Fortune 500 companies : Name Title Team Sport Fee Pat Riley Head coach Miami Heat Pro basketball $50,000 Rick Pitino Head coach Boston Celtics Pro basketball $50,000 Phil Jackson Head coach Los Angeles Lakers Pro basketball $40,000 Lou Holtz Head coach Univ . of South Carolina College football $36,500 Dick Vermeil Former head coach St. Louis Rams Pro football $35,000 Tommy Lasorda Executive Los Angeles Dodgers Pro baseball $35,000 Mike Ditka Former head coach New Orleans Saints Pro football $25,000 Dan Reeves Head coach Atlanta Falcons Pro football $25,000 <p> Source : USA TODAY research
