<p> Office Depot CEO Steve Odland remembers like it was yesterday working in an upscale French restaurant in Denver . <p> The purple sorbet in cut glass he was serving tumbled onto the expensive white gown of an obviously rich and important woman . " I watched in slow motion ruining her dress for the evening , " Odland says . " I thought I would be shot on sight . " <p> Thirty years have passed , but Odland ca n't get the stain out of his mind , nor the woman 's kind reaction . She was startled , regained composure and , in a reassuring voice , told the teenage Odland , " It 's OK . It was n't your fault . " When she left the restaurant , she also left the future Fortune 500 CEO with a life lesson : You can tell a lot about a person by the way he or she treats the waiter . <p> Odland is n't the only CEO to have made this discovery . Rather , it seems to be one of those rare laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . It 's hard to get a dozen CEOs to agree about anything , but all interviewed agree with the Waiter Rule . <p> They acknowledge that CEOs live in a Lake Wobegon world where every dinner or lunch partner is above average in their deference . How others treat the CEO says nothing , they say . But how others treat the waiter is like a magical window into the soul . <p> And beware of anyone who pulls out the power card to say something like , " I could buy this place and fire you , " or " I know the owner and I could have you fired . " Those who say such things have revealed more about their character than about their wealth and power . <p> Whoever came up with the waiter observation " is bang spot on , " says BMW North America President Tom Purves , a native of Scotland , a citizen of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland , who lives in New York City with his Norwegian wife , Hilde , and works for a German company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he says the waiter theory is true everywhere . <p> The CEO who came up with it , or at least first wrote it down , is Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson . He wrote a booklet of 33 short leadership observations called Swanson 's Unwritten Rules of Management . Raytheon has given away 250,000 of the books ( www.raytheon.com ) . Among those 33 rules is only one that Swanson says never fails : " A person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter , or to others , is not a nice person . " <p> Swanson says he first noticed this in the 1970s when he was eating with a man who became " absolutely obnoxious " to a waiter because the restaurant did not stock a particular wine . <p> " Watch out for people who have a situational value system , who can turn the charm on and off depending on the status of the person they are interacting with , " Swanson writes . " Be especially wary of those who are rude to people perceived to be in subordinate roles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people treat hotel maids , mailroom clerks , bellmen and security guards . Au Bon Pain co-founder Ron Shaich , now CEO of Panera Bread , says he was interviewing a candidate for general counsel in St. Louis . She was " sweet " to Shaich but turned " amazingly rude " to someone cleaning the tables , Shaich says . She did n't get the job . <p> Shaich says any time candidates are being considered for executive positions at Panera Bread , he asks his assistant , Laura Parisi , how they treated her , because some applicants are " pushy , self-absorbed and rude " to her before she transfers the call to him . <p> Just about every CEO has a waiter story to tell . Dave Gould , CEO of Witness Systems , experienced the rule firsthand when a waitress dumped a full glass of red wine on the expensive suit of another CEO during a contract negotiation . The victim CEO put her at ease with a joke about not having had time to shower that morning . A few days later , when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO to have the character to work out any differences . <p> CEOs who blow up at waiters have an ego out of control , Gould says . " They 're saying , ' I 'm better . I 'm smarter . ' Those people tend not to be collaborative . " <p> " To some people , speaking in a condescending manner makes them feel important , which to me is a total turnoff , " says Seymour Holtzman , chairman of Casual Male Retail Group , which operates big-and-tall men 's clothing stores including Casual Male XL . <p> How people were raised <p> Such behavior is an accurate predictor of character because it is n't easily learned or unlearned but rather speaks to how people were raised , says Siki Giunta , CEO of U.S. technology company Managed Objects , a native of Rome who once worked as a London bartender . <p> More recently , she had a boss who would not speak directly to the waiter but would tell his assistant what he wanted to eat , and the assistant would tell the waiter in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his character ? " That he was demanding and could not function well without a lot of hand-holding from his support system , " she said . <p> It 's somewhat telling , Giunta says , that the more elegant the restaurant , the more distant and invisible the wait staff is . As if the more important the customer , the less the wait staff matters . People view waiters as their temporary personal employees . Therefore , how executives treat waiters probably demonstrates how they treat their actual employees , says Sara Lee CEO Brenda Barnes , a former waitress and postal clerk , who says she is a demanding boss but never shouts at or demeans an employee . <p> " Sitting in the chair of CEO makes me no better of a person than the forklift operator in our plant , " she says . " If you treat the waiter , or a subordinate , like garbage , guess what ? Are they going to give it their all ? I do n't think so . " <p> CEOs are n't the only ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,500 by It 's Just Lunch , a dating service for professionals , found that being rude to waiters ranks No. 1 as the worst in dining etiquette , at 52% , way ahead of blowing your nose at the table , at 35% . <p> Waiters say that early in a relationship , women will pull them aside to see how much their dates tipped , to get a read on their frugality and other tendencies . They are increasingly discussing boorish behavior by important customers at www.waiterrant.net and other blogs . They do n't seem to mind the demanding customer , such as those who want meals prepared differently because of high blood pressure . But they have contempt for the arrogant customer . <p> Rule works with celebrities , too <p> The Waiter Rule also applies to celebrities , says Jimmy Rosemond , CEO of agency Czar Entertainment , who has brokered deals for Mike Tyson , Mario Winans and Guerilla Black . Rosemond declines to name names , but he remembers one dinner episode in Houston a few years back with a rude divisional president of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt compelled to apologize to the waiter on the way out . " I said , ' Please forgive my friend for acting like that . ' It 's embarrassing . They go into rages for simple mistakes like forgetting an order . " <p> Rosemond says that particular music executive also treated his assistants and interns poorly  --  and was eventually fired . <p> Odland says he saw all types of people 30 years ago as a busboy . " People treated me wonderfully and others treated me like dirt . There were a lot of ugly people . I did n't have the money or the CEO title at the time , but I had the same intelligence and raw ability as I have today . <p> " Why would people treat me differently ? Your value system and ethics need to be constant at all times regardless of who you are dealing with . " <p> Holtzman grew up in the coal-mining town of Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , and in the 1950s saw opportunity as a waiter 90 miles away in the Catskill Mountains , where customers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tipped poorly , he would say : " Sir , will you and your wife be tipping separately ? " <p> " I saw a lot of character , or the lack thereof , " says Holtzman , who says he can still carry three dishes in his right hand and two in his left . <p> " But for some twist of fate in life , they 're the waiter and you 're the one being waited on , " Barnes says .
