( TWO BLACK MEN ENTER . ONE , THE DRUMMER , PLAYS A SOFT RHYTHM ON A JEMBE DRUM . THE OTHER , THE GRIOT , MAY ACCOMPANY ON A BELL , A RATTLE , A FLUTE OR AN IMPROVISED CHANT . THE GRIOT MUST BE VERY ADEPT AT TELLING A STORY IN A LIVELY , ANIMATED FASHION . THE STORIES ARE INTENDED TO ENTERTAIN . THE DRUMMER WILL PROVIDE TRANSITIONS AND UNDERPINNING WHERE DESIRED . ) GRIOT When I first moved to New York City in the summer of 1968 , I got a studio apartment in Harlem , up on 132nd Street , between Lenox and Fifth Ave . My apartment was on the front , so I caught the cool breezes through my two open front windows . Whenever I practiced playing my drum in front of those windows , a small group of kids who lived in that block would gather to listen . They were n't kids in a way ; they were like little old men whose minds had outgrown their bodies . The streets made them grow up faster . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to teach them drumming . " I 'm just learning myself . How could I teach you ? " I explained . But they persisted and I gave in . In a few days I had about 8 boys , ages 5 to 13 , in my apartment 3 days a week , learning how to drum with me . They made me remember something that happened to me when I was 13 and in the 7th grade : I thought I was a man , a grown one . On the day that the final report cards came out , I got into a physical fight with the teacher , a fist fight . He won actually , but that fight instantly elevated me to manhood in the eyes of my gang of friends . It took nerve to take on a teacher . I showed I had heart . My honchos were awestricken ; word spread all over the school like dust in a hurricane . My masculine prowess achieved legendary status within an hour . Not only had I swung on the teacher , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including gym . As if to reaffirm my freshly acquired manhood , I acquired a certain habit as I walked home from school on report card day . I walked the hip walk , the coolest , smoothest perambulation befitting my emergent manhood . I walked with a dip . You know . You bend that knee and drag that foot ever so slightly . Through your walk you showed the street that you was ready for anything it got , that you do n't blink in the face of any peril that may confront you on the street . All the way home my honchos chattered about my deed that day . My status on the street was assured : I fought the teacher ; I flunked all my subjects ; I walked with a dip --  the three sacred pillars of black manhood in the juvenile streets . I was baaaaaad ! My honchos walked me all the way to the front door of my house where they lingered on the porch . They wanted to bask just a little while longer in the aura of my manhood . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something suddenly , violently clutched my shoulder . It was like the eagle 's talons that pierce the body of its prey ; it stopped me abruptly and jerked me backwards . I turned my head to see what had snagged me , and the world temporarily moved in slow motion . Over my shoulder I saw a broomstick on its way to my head . Empowering that broomstick was a big fat arm that looked exactly like my mother 's big fat arm . It was n't one of those Martha Stewart broomsticks that petite , well coiffed white ladies in the suburbs use to clean their spotless houses on the television . It was one of them broomsticks that tough Irish cops once used to break up barroom brawls . It was an elongated billy club . Suddenly the world burst out of slow motion and the club seemed to simultaneously hit my head , my shoulders , my arms , my butt my legs , my back and then started again on my head . At first I tried to reason with my mother . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " THE TEACHER SAY YOU HIT HIM ! I DID N'T SEND YOU TO SCHOOL TO FIGHT THE TEACHER . YOU CA N'T FIGHT THE TEACHER . YOU FLUNKED ALL YOUR SUBJECTS . I WWO N'T LET THE STREETS HAVE YOU . I 'LL KILL YOU MYSELF BEFORE I LET THE STREET GET . YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT . I TAUGHT YOU BETTER THAN THAT . NO , YOU WAN NA BE A HOODLUM IN STREETS ! NO , I 'LL KILL YOU FIRST ! " She screamed and screamed and hit and hit . But I did n't cry because my honchos were still on the porch . They had front row seats . I could n't let them down ! They were depending on me to uphold manhood . Because a man who fights his teacher , who flunks all his subjects and who walks with a dip ca n't be crying just because his mama is killing him . You ca n't let death interfere with your manhood ! You have to take the pain ! Like a man ! M-A-N . Suddenly , my mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back and forth while she cried and cried like a baby . She wailed like a baby . She mourned as if she were mourning the dead . Tears cascaded down her cheeks and wet my hair . Her sobs shook the floor where we stood . The whole street heard her crying as clearly as they 'd heard her screaming . Neighbors came out on their porches to listen . I looked up into my mama 's eyes and was shocked at what I saw . Her eyes were wide open , wider than I 'd ever seen her open her eyes ; they were soaked with tears that flowed endlessly ; they were burgeoning with naked fear ; my mother was terrorized ; she thought she lost me to the streets ; she thought I had given up like so many black boys and headed down the pathological path toward the anti-life of the damned ; it was as though she were watching me being sucked into a machine that grinds wood into chips , a street that chews up black boys and spits out bloody chips that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her eyes I was being dragged down into Satan 's fiery pit from which return was impossible . She wailed and wailed , cried and cried , rocked and rocked , and as I looked into her eyes , I saw what I had done to my mother , and the thick headed dam of my manhood burst and my tears mingled with her 's . I cried and cried and cried and cried : " I 'M SORRY , MAMA . I 'M SORRY . OH , MAMA , DO N'T CRY . I 'M SORRY , MAMA . I 'M SORRY . " My honchos were laughing by now . My manhood had dissolved quickly in my mother 's tears . I was ruined on the streets . My masculine castle washed away like sand when the tide goes out . I do n't remember how long we stood there holding each other , crying and wailing . ( PAUSE ) But I do remember that the very next semester I got all A 's . That same teacher I 'd fought became my hero . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wiped the terror from my mother 's eyes . All I had to give those kids on 132nd St. was a BASS , TONE , SLAP . I could n't make the world better . I could n't replace their fathers . I could n't buy them the opportunities that wealth could buy others . I had only a BASS , A TONE and a SLAP . ( TRANSITIONAL DRUMMING , LOW VARIATIONS OF BASS-TONE-SLAP . FADE OUT AS STORYTELL STARTS THE NEXT STORY. ) @x ( DRUM TRANSITION , VARIATION OF BASE-TONE-SLAP . REMAINS LOW UNDER GRIOT 'S VOICE AND FADES OUT AS HE BEGINS THE THIRD STORY. ) @x Africa . I was killed there in 1973 , Dar Es Salaam , Tanzania , East Africa . It started one late , very hot night in a rooftop bar on a backstreet . I was sitting at a table with four other Africamerican men , an elderly black nationalist who had settled in Tanzania and was always broke , Ralph and Howard who were helping me to research a film and Wayne , a wild man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 week vacation shooting at the Portuguese colonialists in Angola . I was there to research a film about the African struggles for independence . We were all feeling quite proud of our African heritage and smugly congratulated each other on being among the few Africamericans to return to the Motherland to reclaim our roots . The bar was packed with local working class folk : Kikuyu sailors from Mombasa in Kenya ; traders from Kampala in Uganda ; Merchants from Zimbabwe ; laborers from Burundi ; refugees from Angola and Mozambique ; office workers from Eithiopia ; vendors from South Africa ; gat ( kat ) dealers from Somalia ; fabulous musicians from Congo Kinshasha ; prostitutes from everywhere . There was an endless variety of patrons , many of whom seemed to overhear the increasingly raucous conversation at the Africamericans ' table . We were wildly debating everything that had to do with Africa : wars for independence , poverty , tribalism , colonialism , neo-colonialism , polygamy , local corruption , cultural differences , religion , African literature , politics and white settlers who owned huge tracts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure of black Africa . The more we drank the louder we got and the more intemperate and chaotic our remarks . We drank as we blamed everyone for Africa 's failure to throw off the white man 's yoke . We drank while we especially blamed the Africans themselves for their plight . We drank and declared that African tribalism , clan and sub-clan loyalties , along with ruthless corruption , barbaric violence and unbridled greed , were as responsible for Africa 's failure as the ongoing invasion of the whites . Some at our table drank and loudly ridiculed local customs and habits . I noticed several people gathering about our table to openly listen to us . Once the debaters saw that they 'd attracted an audience , they began to perform ; their oratory flew about furiously . Word seemed to be spreading throughout the bar about the performance . Dozens of patrons managed to pass by our table and catch pieces of the debate . There did seem to be two problems though : First , there were many languages being spoken in the bar -- Swahili , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kikongo , to name a few . Translations were rife as we spoke . Much of what we were saying was being badly distorted by random interpreters . I noticed the second problem when I saw that many people were gesturing angrily toward us and speaking in harsh tones in several languages . Something had gone terribly wrong at this rooftop bar . Soon , I noticed that the women were leaving in droves and dozens of African men were staring at us like we were vermin . Someone at our table hastily recalled that often in traditional Africa the women disappeared before a battle began . As the last woman started for the door , I grabbed my attache case and ran to the door ; the others immediately followed me . We hurried down three flights and walked quickly into the street . We were relieved as we hurried down this long , dark street toward the well lighted Askari Square . Askari Square contained a stone statue of an Askari , an African soldier who fought under the British flag to save the world for democracy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thick walls built of homemade bricks and stucco and huge wooden doors . Each shop had a deep doorwell that reminded me of a cave entrance . We hurried toward the light that bathed the stone Askari . Halfway down the street , we caught glimpses of a mob forming on the opposite side of the street . It was moving parallel to us , keeping up with us and growing by the second . We could discern that members of the mob were picking up rocks , chunks of broken concrete , wooden clubs , and broken bottles . They were shouting things at us in broken swahili , things like : " WAZUNGO ZANJ ! " ( White black men ! ) " KUFA , ZUNGO , KUFA , ZUNGO ! " ( Death , white man , death , white man ! ) " KUFA HAPPA ALFAJIRI , WAZUNGO ! " ( Death here before dawn , white men ! ) I knew enough swahili to know that wazungo means white tribe and zanj means black ; and kufa ?  --  kufa ? ( realizing ) KUFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here . Alfajiri , before dawn . They were going to kill us ! To lynch us ! To pulverize us for what ? Because they thought we were white ? We were as terrified as we were perplexed . We had come to Africa with a sense of black pride , but we were about to be lynched on a dark backstreet by a mob of our indigenous black African brothers who were inexplicably enraged at us . There was no arguing . We prepared to fight for our lives ! No one can know beforehand one 's response in such circumstances . Without thinking , I took charge . Inside my attache case were a beer can opener with a sharp point which I gave to Howard , a thick bamboo flute about 18 inches long which I gave to Ralph . I had a utility knife and Wayne had a knife disguised as a belt buckle . The elderly man had a stick . An instant plan asserted itself : We would keep walking rapidly toward the monument lights , but when they attacked , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only enough room in the doorway for two of them , maybe three , to attack the five of us at a time . So we planned to rip and stab and slice and club and smash . . . The wild animal across the street was about ready to leap on us . I snapped shut the latches on my attache case . The snapping latches had a sound not unlike the snap of a carriage in an automatic pistol when a round is pushed into the chamber . From across the street we heard some thickly accented voices proclaim from the blackness : " Guns ! They have guns . Guns . " I immediately said to my group : in a loud enough voice : " Nobody shoot before I do . Got that ! Wait until I shoot first ! " Then I flipped the attache latch several more times . Within seconds the mob began to disperse into the night . And we ran all the way to the light and to our YMCA hotel . That night the old me was killed . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the world through new eyes , eyes that had been opened wide by terror . ( TRANSITION : SOFT DRUM UNDER UNTIL THE LAST MONOLOGUE BEGINS . VARIATION OF BASS-TONE-SLAP . ) BASS , TONE , SLAP seemed to be the most reasonable things I could give those kids on 132nd Street . It was dependable , not like a war 10,000 miles away , not like lying politicians , not like jumping on postmodernism 's bandwagon and such as those . BASS , TONE , SLAP was an invitation to the universe. @x ( DRUM TRANSITION : THE DRUM PLAYS SOFTLY UNDER UNTIL THE END OF THE GRIOT 'S WORDS AT WHICH TIME THE DRUMMER CAN DO A BRIEF ( 3 OR MORE MINUTES ) DRUM MEDLEY OF DIFFERENT RHYTHMS. ) p. 8 GRIOT Back in the States we were singing about " SAY IT LOUD !

" If you master the BASS TONE SLAP , you can speak to all the rhythms of the universe . If you can get the basics of life , you can understand others ; you can escape the subtle traps that this society lays for you . You can navigate the chaos . You got ta learn everything you can .
