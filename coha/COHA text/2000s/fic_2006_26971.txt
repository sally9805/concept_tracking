Castle Kettwyck Late summer , 1072 " Taken ? " ' T was the dignified Lady Beatrice , sitting across from Kathryn de St. Marie , who 'd spoken . " If the barbarian Scots took me , they would have to kill me before I would ever show my face in civilization again . " A shiver ran down Kathryn 's spine . Surely Kettwyck 's new walls were sufficient to keep any raiding Scotsmen out . And there were many strong and powerful Norman knights present for the festivities here at her father 's holding . Still , they were very near the border , far from the safety of the Abbey de St. Marie where she and her sister , Isabel , had spent the last ten years . Were they vulnerable here at Kettwyck ? The fortress was not yet complete , and Kathryn had seen workmen adding mortar and stone to the walls that very day . She dearly hoped this welcoming banquet was not premature .

She could never come bac --  " The old biddy 's words faded into the night when Sir Geoffroi Le Chievre came up behind Kathryn and touched her shoulder . Slivers of heat raced down her arm at the touch of the young man who 'd attracted herattention earlier in the day . They 'd flirted some , and she 'd been intrigued . But she had not expected him to come to her here . " Come and join in the dance . " Kathryn stood , but her mother 's words followed her as she accompanied Geoffroi away from the cluster of old women in her father 's great hall . " Once you become a Scotsman 's whore , you might as well be dead . " " Do n't listen to those old flap dragons , " Geoffroi said , leading her to the courtyard where the musicians played and the young people had gathered to dance . " I mean no offense to your mother or the other ladies , but Kettwyck 's walls are stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course you 're right , " Kathryn said , smiling up at the young knight . She put away all thoughts of Scotsmen and her father 's castle walls and gave her attention to Sir Geoffroi Le Chievre . To his credit , he 'd barely taken note of her sister , Isabel , the comely one . Isabel had pleaded with their father to allow them to choose their own husbands . Lord Henri had agreed , to a point . He 'd drawn up a list of favored candidates and gathered them here for the festivities marking the two sisters ' arrival at Kettwyck and their reunion with their parents . Over the next few days , each sister would choose a husband . Kathryn was certain that even without a generous dowry , Isabel would have no trouble settling on a bridegroom . The lords and knights here were mad for her attention , while Kathryn quietly yearned for the honest affections of one man , a bridegroom who would honor and revere her for what she was , not for the wealth she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew . The daughters of powerful Norman barons married to achieve strategic goals , not to satisfy silly yearnings . Besides , she held not the same appeal as beautiful Isabel . Kathryn 's eyes were merely brown , and her hair was the color of a mouse 's pelt , so different from her sister , whose eyes were stunningly golden and her hair a striking , glossy black . Kathryn had grown up in Isabel 's shadow , but the two sisters could not have been closer . She did not begrudge the attention Isabel garnered with her beauty and her many talents . Both young women had been exceptionally well educated at the abbey , and Kathryn had a head for languages . The abbess had said her skills would serve a husband well , but Kathryn had never spoken of the fire that burned unquenched within her . She 'd been too embarrassed to ask the holy woman about the deep yearnings she felt for the caring touch of a husband . She 'd imagined her bridegroom 's kiss and his gentle caress too many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd heard of no other maid who admitted to such desires -- not even Isabel . Kathryn admired Geoffroi as he danced so well , wishing she could match the grace and elegance of his movements . Yet not once did the intricate steps of the chain dance require that he take her in his arms , or even touch her hand . At this rate , Kathryn would never know if Geoffroi was the one she should choose as her bridegroom . She needed to know if his touch . . . if his kiss . . . could flame the fires that burned within her . She seemed destined never to know , for Geoffroi was a proper knight who would observe custom and keep her under the watchful eye of the matrons . Taking matters into her own hands , she beckoned him away from the crowded courtyard . " Lady Kathryn ? " She made no reply , but took his hand and moved quickly into the bailey adjacent to the keep . With so many people about , no one took note of their departure . Laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped in a dark corner . A mere sliver of the moon lit their faces , but Isabel could see puzzlement in Geoffroi 's expression . She knew her actions were much too bold for a well-bred lady , but she had to discover whether Geoffroi 's touch , his kiss , could satisfy the hunger within her . She wanted to know if he 'd sought her out because she pleased him , or because he realized Isabel had already made her choice , giving him cause to settle on her . Was this the man who would cherish her , who would give her the children she craved ? " Kiss me , Geoffroi . " Her voice sounded too breathless , too anxious for one who had never been guilty of cowardice . Yet Geoffroi 's motivation had taken on a great deal of importance . Kathryn had to know if she was what he wanted . . . or if it was just her dowry that attracted him . " Kathryn , I do n't think --  " Continues ...        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
