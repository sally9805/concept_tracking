With his well-received courses at Pilgrim 's Run , The Kingsley Club and Diamond Springs , Mike DeVries has come to rival Arthur Hills as the designer laureate of Michigan . His latest creation will only add to that luster . The 6,828-yard Greywalls course at Marquette Golf Club on Michigan 's Upper Peninsula is a wild , tumbling adventure routed through a forested valley and around wetlands and exposed granite outcroppings . It is a testament to DeVries ' imagination that he could envision any course at all on this heaving property , much a good one . The tee shot at the 579-yard first hole demands concentration not because it 's particularly demanding  --  in fact , it 's a reasonably generous landing area on a sweeping , dogleg right  --  but because of the views from the tee . On a clear day you can see all the way to Lake Superior . Another memorable hole is the 312-yard fifth , where a towering rock face protects the green  --  the very walls that give the course its name .
