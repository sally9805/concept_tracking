I 'd flown all night . Taking off from New York , banking over the Atlantic , the plane had headed east into the darkness , toward Rome . Stars filled the sky . Once the flight attendants dimmed the cabin lights , I stared out the window at a thousand constellations . I do n't think I slept a minute . My thoughts were a web , swinging me from one star to the next . <br> I was alone . I mean , there were other people on the plane , but I was traveling by myself , without Lucy . You do n't take little sisters on missions , especially when you are completely unsure of the outcome . My grandmother insisted I fly first-class . It was n't even a discussion  --  once I told her that I was going to Italy to see my mother , as much as she disliked the idea , she put me in touch with the family travel agent , with the words " Pell Davis , you 've always loved a lost cause . " <br> Travis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We did n't speak a lot . We each had too much on our minds . He had to get back to his job , I was thinking about what I 'd set out for myself on this trip , and we both were considering the weeks of being apart looming ahead . <br> There were good reasons for this trip . I knew I did n't have to explain them to Travis . He 's my boyfriend , but we have an unusual relationship . He 's a football star at our school , and therefore tough , but sensitive in ways that belie outward facts . <br> He drove me through Connecticut , across the Whitestone Bridge , to the Alitalia terminal at JFK . We got there very early , hours to spare . The June midday sun was hot as we stepped out of the car . <br> Travis lifted my bags and backpack from the trunk , checked to make sure I had my passport . Twenty-four hours earlier , the maximum allowable span , he had printed out my boarding pass for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to drive home to Newport . He had signed onto a fishing boat as deckhand , and they went out at dusk . <br> We took care of each other , just as we took care of our sisters and , in Travis 's case , his mother . Both of our fathers are dead . They died too young , beloved men . We are shaped by the loss of our fathers , and others . Perhaps that 's what drew me to Travis in the first place , a sense that he understood love and life 's beauty are real , but any assurance they will last forever is a soothing lie . <br> The flight from New York was smooth . Flying eastward across Long Island at sunset , I looked down and saw the North and South forks , the curve of Montauk , the dark water of Block Island Sound beneath scratchy white wakes of fishing boats and pleasure craft . Could one of those boats hold Travis ? I chose to think yes , I saw him as I left , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You can see everything . All it takes is the right kind of attention . When my father taught me to play baseball , we 'd stand out in the yard until the light died and fireflies came out . He 'd throw and I 'd catch , or he 'd pitch and I 'd hit . He 'd say , " Do n't take your eyes off the ball , sweetheart . No matter what , just keep your eyes on the ball . " That 's how to see everything with the people you love  --  keep watching , stay vigilant , watch the ball instead of the fireflies . <br> So my last sight over the United States was of Travis 's boat . He and his family are looking after my sleepwalking sister while I am gone . An ocean later , I landed at Rome , was met by a driver , and taken to Sorrento . Two and a half hours on the road , a chance to think about what I am about to do . <br> The long drive from Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's style of driver : uniformed chauffeur . I will be straightforward about something right now , just so you will understand . Gossip columns , before and after she left the country , referred to my mother as " Lyra Nicholson Davis , heiress . " Now they say the same of Lucy and me . Old money , blue-bloods , heirs to the Nicholson silver fortune . We ignore what is said . They now say of my mother , " reclusive heiress . " We overlook that too . <br> My grandmother arranged to borrow the chauffeur from her friend Contessa Otavia Migliori , who used to spend summers in Newport , at Stone Lea , the property next door to what used to be the Aitkens ' , parents of Martha Sharp Crawford , also known as Sunny von Bxlow . Another tragic Newport family . I think of Cosima , daughter of Sunny and Claus , her father accused of trying to kill her mother over Christmas holidays by injecting her with insulin , then leaving her in a room with windows open to the frigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> This is the most terrible thing I ever heard , and it sticks with me over the years , but I once heard my mother crying , shrieking , that something was killing her , killing everything she had inside her . Even as a child , I knew she was n't talking about a knife or a gun or a drug . She meant her heart and soul . She left us about a week later . And the really unjust , awful thing is , it took a few years , but my father is the one who wound up dying . <br> Anyway , the contessa 's chauffeur drove me to Sorrento , an ancient seaside city filled with dark and crumbling beauty I felt too nervous to notice . Lucy would have  --  she loves antiquities , ghosts , and architecture . I felt pricked by guilt ; perhaps I should have brought my sister . Will Lucy be okay without me this summer ? We 're very close . For so long , we 've been each other 's most important person . <br> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to expect . What if our mother rejects us all over again ? I am strong . I have Travis . But Lucy is my little sister . I want to protect her . <br> The limousine snaked down the hill to the port . Bright boats lined the docks , reminding me of Newport . I opened the window to smell the sea air . The chauffeur seemed to know just where to go . <br> He drove along the quay , past shops selling shell jewelry , colorful pareos , and finely woven sun hats . I saw stalls of fresh fish , their glistening bodies packed in seaweed , yellow eyes flat and sightless . The smell of strong coffee hit me as we passed a cafe . I wanted some , but could n't bear to stop until I saw if she 'd come to meet me . <br> We drove between a pair of stone pillars , onto a wooden dock . It seemed like a loading zone  --  fishing boats and small cargo vessels were tied alongside , and trucks filled with supplies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : halyards clanging against masts , longshoremen swinging big iron hooks . We stopped at the end of the pier . I climbed out . It felt good to stretch my legs , but my chest was in a knot . Had my mother come to meet me ? Was I about to see her ? <br> The chauffeur lowered my bags into a yellow wooden boat tied to barnacle-covered pilings . An old man in a blue shirt and rumpled khakis , his face tan and wrinkled and hair pure white , grabbed the bags , stowed them under a varnished wooden seat . I stood on the dock , staring at the man . <br> " Hello , Pell , " the man said in an English accent . " Come along now , and I 'll take you to your mother . " <br> " She 's not here , " I said stupidly . <br> " No , " he said without explanation . I was upset , and he could see . He stared at me with sharp blue eyes . He did n't fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , an earthquake , a plague of locusts , any of the many things that could have detained her . Reaching up , he offered to help me down into the boat from the pier . <br> " Buono viaggio , " the chauffeur said to me . <br> I thanked him . I did n't tip him , knowing my grandmother would have made arrangements with the contessa . Then I took the old man 's hand , stepped down from the dock into the yellow boat . <br> " I 'm Max Gardiner , " he said . <br> " Her neighbor , " I said . I 'd heard the name before , in letters about Capri , the island 's expatriate community , all the artists and intellectuals , the fabulous people , the thinkers and writers who so fascinated her , who 'd moved to the island from the United States and England , who had become her friends , companions in her desire to insulate herself from the world . From her daughters , Lucy and me . Max owned the land next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now sit tight . Prepare for wonder . " <br> Wonder . Had he really said that ? I forced a polite smile that hid the pain I felt . I was n't new to the sea . I 'd visited islands before . I 'd been on boats every summer of my life . Now I was on the way to force myself in , to spend time with a woman who 'd never wanted me , who did n't want me now . <br> I untied the bowline to be helpful and show him I knew my way around boats , then took my seat as he cast off . The engine sputtered , and we headed out . Bright day , brilliant blue sky , sparkling sea . <br> It could have been Newport , this atmosphere of the sea , yachts , classic wooden workboats with nets glittering with fish scales ; I thought of Travis , in a time zone six hours behind me . He would have returned from a night of fishing ; he would be asleep in his family 's cottage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister was sleeping as well . There was this incident , a dream-state walking-to-Italy kind of thing , that we hope wo n't repeat itself . I held my backpack tight to my chest . It felt compact , comforting . I had filled it with books , letters , pictures of the people I love . <br> We puttered out of the channel . I heard a breath come from the water just below the gunwale  --  a quick , happy intake of air , then a rushed exhalation . Dolphins swimming beside our yellow boat . I glanced over my shoulder at Max . Was this what he 'd meant by wonder ? He smiled at me , pointed dead ahead . <br> " You only get this chance once , " he said . <br> " What chance ? " I asked . <br> " To arrive on Capri for the first time . I feel privileged to witness it . " <br> It 's an island , I wanted to say . Far from home . A mountain , a harbor . Marine mammals , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward again , my posture stoic as the boat gained speed . <br> And as I stared ahead , I saw : the white rocks of Monte Solaro , craggy against the sapphire sky , a precipitous drop down to the radiant sea . I smelled lemons , verbena , and pine , their scents carried on the wind . Terraces of olive groves , leaves flashing silver in the sun . Capri rose from the waves , and I realized how often I 'd dreamed of this . The island was the most beautiful place I 'd ever seen , and not because of the scenery . <br> Because my mother lived there . <br> * * * <br> Max had left the villa just before dawn . He 'd crossed the broad stone terrace , made his way down the steep , winding stairs , through groves of olive and fig trees . The sharply pitched land was terraced , overlooking the Bay of Naples ; he used a flashlight , but he could have found his way blindfolded  --  he was seventy-two , and had lived here over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he wanted to shout , wake up the island , tell Lyra , Rafe , all the islanders , to open their eyes . Love one another , be happy , life is short ! <br> Two levels down from the villa , he had passed the small white cottage , saw one light burning . Lyra was already awake , keeping vigil . Last night 's almost full moon had hung low in the sky , casting silver light across the water , pulling at the tides . Low tide was treacherous twice each month , when the water ebbed under the new and full moons , exposing rocks and stranding sea creatures in tidal pools that would n't fill until the lunar cycle came round again . <br> Now , steering his yellow boat back from Sorrento , he had Pell safe and sound , on her way to Lyra . Max saw his grandson walking the rocky shore , rescuing invertebrates . Capri was a blue mirage , the massif of Monte Solaro floating above the sea . Max looked up , seeking out the whitewashed cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyra , standing among olive trees . <br> " She 's waiting for you , " he said . <br> " My mother , " Pell said . <br> " Yes , " Max replied . He slowed the boat down , steered toward the private dock . <br> " Where ? " she asked , shielding her eyes . <br> " Up there , " Max said , pointing . <br> Pell 's expression made his heart catch . He glanced up , wondering if Lyra could catch the full impact of her effect on her daughter through the binoculars . The young girl 's head was tilted back , her mouth open . There was joy in hope . <br> As Max pulled up to the dock , the dolphins leapt and dove , swimming away . Dolphins were emotional creatures , just like people . They were capable of love , great loyalty , staying together for life . If ever they were separated from their children , one ripped from the other , the parents grieved and keened . He 'd observed that in dolphins , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked Pell . <br> " Ready , " she said . <br> He looked around , wanting help with the lines , but Rafe seemed to have disappeared . So Max climbed up on the wooden dock , and tied the boat fast . <br> * * * <br> Lyra braced her elbows on the wall , to steady them . She finally pressed the binoculars to her eyes . Max docking the boat . And up forward , in the bow , a lovely young girl . Shocking , stunning , take-your-breath-away beauty . Long dark hair tied back , tendrils blowing around her face . Pell stared straight up the hill , as if she could see Lyra behind the stone wall , and maybe she could . Even as a baby she 'd had an intense , seeking gaze . <br> The sight of her daughter made every muscle in Lyra 's body jump , as if her skin had memories all its own . She felt pressure on , not in , her chest : a six-pound , seven-ounce weight . Pell , just born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowing . Lyra had held her daughter . Taylor was right there , standing beside them , but the moment was Lyra and Pell 's . It 's not every day you have a daughter , and as much as you might love her father , he 'll never know the wild electricity you have with her . <br> Standing in her Italian garden , Lyra Davis stared down at the small yellow boat and thought of that tiny baby . She pictured the six-year-old girl that baby had become . Pell had been six , Lucy four , when Lyra left  --  ten years since Lyra had seen either of her daughters . <br> Continues ...
