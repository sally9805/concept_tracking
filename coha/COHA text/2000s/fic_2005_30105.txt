An Accidental Goddess By Linnea Sinclair Random House Linnea Sinclair 1 It was n't the first time Gillie had hazily regained consciousness flat on her back in sick bay , feeling stiff and out of sorts . And unable to account for a missing two or three hours . Pub-crawling did have its side effects . But it was the first time she 'd been unable to account for a missing two or three hundred years . Not even a week of pub-crawling could explain that . Three hundred forty-two years , sixteen hours , Simon 's voice stated clearly in her mind . If you want to be absolutely accurate . She did n't . Her math skills had never been her strong point . And three hundred years was a close enough estimate to cause her stomach to do flip-flops in a way a bottle of Devil 's Breath never had . The possibility that she 'd died flitted across her mind-though death would n't have thrown her inexplicably into the future . Even so , she thought it prudent to pull her essence out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own body on the diag table . By all appearances , she was still short , blond , and very much alive . The readout on the medistat confirmed the last part of her hastily conducted diagnosis . It detailed a few bumps and bruises as well as notations on a mild concussion , no doubt the source of her blistering headache . A headache that was n't the least bit helped by whatever heathen concoction was being pumped into her system through the round med-broche clamped to her wrist . Med-broches ! Raheiran technology rarely used such invasive things . She longed to alter its feed rate but knew her mental tinkering would likely set off some alarm . She 'd almost tripped a few when she 'd awakened ten minutes ago , groggy and achy , then tried to spike into this sick bay 's systems . Impatience invariably leads to sloppy work , Simon had chastised . Sloppy work , a bitch of a headache , and a reality that suddenly did not make sense . How in the Seven Hells had she ended up three hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some unknown space station 's sick bay ? With Simon in a similar state of disarray a few decks below . The Fav'lhir . Ah , yes . Small matter of a large warship intent on her destruction . Obviously , the Fav had n't succeeded . Though something had happened . They 're vicious and powerful , Simon , but they do n't have time-travel capabilities . Neither do we . Someone or something else pulled us here . Wherever here was . That much she ought to find out . She stepped away from her unconscious body on the diag table , peeked around the corner of the small room . Felt foolish and could hear Simon 's wry chuckle . No one could see her . At least , no one other than Simon , who , from his tone , was very aware she 'd pulled out of her self to explore her surroundings . Have a care , My Lady . You were injured . We 've more serious things to consider than my few aches and pains . There were two other patients in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't know them ; there 'd been no one on her ship when the Fav had attacked other than Simon and herself . The girl on the diag bed was too young to be part of the squadron she 'd worked with in the Khalaran Fleet . Almost automatically , Gillie touched their essences , sending healing energy as she walked by . Then she sidestepped quickly , and unnecessarily , as a thin man in a blue lab coat hurried past and into the corridor . She followed him and for the next fifteen minutes was thoroughly astounded , and more than a little disconcerted , by what she saw . Wide corridors were filled with people in various modes of dress , from the utilitarian freighter-crew shipsuits to more exotic costumes with flowing skirts and elaborate fringed shawls . She noted the familiar range of skin tones-from the dusky to the pale-and hair colors-mostly browns and blacks but a few bright reds and light blonds-and heard all three Khalaran dialects . A few languages were harder to identify . Rim-world tongues , most likely , clipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the antigrav pallets trailing behind a group of dockworkers , surprised by the pallets ' advanced configuration . Raised her eyebrows further at the state-of-the-art holovid news kiosks and station diagrams near the lift banks . Those she studied carefully , listening to the chatter around her ; tech talk about scanner arrays and enviro grids . That matched what she saw on the diagram suspended three-dimensionally out from the bulkhead . The Khalaran Confederation , with her assistance , had just been developing the technology to create a deep-space station the likes of which she looked at now . At least , they had been a day ago . Correction , three hundred and forty-two years ago . Yet it was n't this jump in technology that bothered her . Nor this space structure bristling with unexpected weapons and sensors and databanks . Nor her headache . Or the stiffness in her left shoulder , the result of her sudden collision with the bulkhead when the Fav'lhir ship had exploded a little too close for comfort off her starboard side . Even the unexplained missing three hundred some- odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in those three hundred some-odd years , there 'd been no other Raheiran advisers in this sector . Simon had checked station security logs . Given her people 's minimal-intervention policy , that was one of the few things that made sense . No , none of those things bothered her at all . What really bothered her was something she heard in the corridor chatter as she continued her brief , hurried tour . Something she viewed on the news kiosks and station diagrams . And finally , something she saw as she stood before the temple 's double-doored entrance , shaking her head in disbelief . What really bothered Gillaine Davre was that during her **27;301;TOOLONG absence , the damned Khalar had gone on a shrine-building kick and made her into a deity . Simon ? There 's a huge holograph of me in this temple ! But I 'm not-It appears they think you are , My Lady . Oh , hell . Oh , damn . This was n't a minor error in alien protocol . This was a mistake . A big one that encompassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to get away from here . Now . Now is not possible , I fear . When ? Three weeks , perhaps less . There 's much damage to repair . There 'll be worse damage if they find out who I am ! Calm down , Gillaine , Kiasidira . There 's no reason they should . That holo 's fairly old-you 're in formal dress in it and your hair 's quite different . And I 'm finding no references to you as Captain Davre . Only as the Kiasidira . However , just to be on the safe side , I do recommend avoiding contact with any Raheiran crystal and , of course , any itinerant witches or sorcerers . The Khalar are n't mageline . Then we 'll have no problems , will we ? Just be your usual charming self for the next few weeks and no one will know a goddess walks among them . I 'm not a goddess ! Nor are you seriously injured . Therefore , if you do n't return to your self rather quickly , that medical officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like . Rynan Makarian frowned at the irritatingly incomplete data on his deskscreen and knew it was all his fault . It had been four months since he 'd been given the command to establish a Fleet presence on Cirrus One and secure it for the Project . Station systems were still far from optimal . Cirrus One was far from optimal ; the station had passed its prime well over eighty-five years ago . " Give it to Mack . He 'll fix it , " someone in Fleet defense and logistics no doubt had said . It would n't have been the first time it was said either . He knew his reputation for unerring efficiency preceded him . It had bestowed upon him the rank of admiral in the Khalaran 's newly organized Fifth Fleet at the unlikely age of forty-three . And bestowed upon him the derelict monstrosity known as Cirrus One , to rehab into a usable headquarters for the Fifth . And , within the next four months , to have that same derelict monstrosity serve as something even more important than that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That project , more than Cirrus One , had drawn him off the bridge of the Vedritor and ensconced him behind a desk-albeit a well-dented , slightly rusted one . But it was Cirrus One that took up the majority of his time . And time was the one thing he lacked . He had little more than a month in which to get his HQ fully operational and secure . Missing supplies , incomplete data , and delayed support staff notwithstanding . He rested his elbows on that same battered desk and leaned his forehead against his fists . Damn . There was a wisdom in imperfection . He saw that clearly now . What was that adage that Lady Kiasidira 's priests used to comfort the misguided ? We are all in a continuing process of growth . There are no mistakes . Only lessons . Cirrus One was one hell of a lesson . Had he allowed himself a few mistakes in his career , he might well still be on the bridge of the Vedritor . A mere senior captain , not an admiral with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercom trilled . He tapped the flashing icon , leaned back in his chair . " Makarian . " A familiar thin , dusky-toned face wavered , solidified on the screen . Doc Janek , his chief medical officer . His blue lab coat bore the Vedritor 's insignia . Like many things Mack had requested , Fifth Fleet uniforms were still " in transit . " As supply routes went , Cirrus One was n't in the middle of nowhere . It was just the last exit before it . " Admiral , you asked to be notified . Our visitor from that damaged freighter 's awake . " Yet one more thing to plague his schedule with delays : an unauthorized ship with an unconscious pilot . An image flashed through Mack 's mind : a pale-haired young woman in nondescript spacer grays lying awkwardly on the decking , just behind the pilot 's chair . Emergency lighting had tinged the small bridge with glaring shades of red , casting eerie shadows over her small , still form . Another smuggler , he 'd thought at that moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a studied dislike for smugglers , yet had felt it would be a shame if this one died . He 'd caught little more than her profile as the med-techs had lifted her onto an antigrav stretcher , but it had been enough for him to mentally tag her as beautiful , before he was even aware he 'd done so . That was n't like him . It was unprofessional , judgmental . She was nothing more than a temporary annoyance . But she was beautiful . It made the job of questioning her a bit less unpleasant . " On my way . " He slapped off the intercom , threw one more frustrating glance at the inadequate , nonsensical data , and strode from his office . The sights and sounds of Cirrus One assaulted him immediately . He 'd thought by now he 'd be used to them . Had the sights and sounds been continually repetitive , he probably would have been . But there was always something new . Or rather , there was always something . His office was a few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a level or two below , or possibly above , as Mack stepped into the open corridor . A man and a woman , in the blue shipsuits of a starfreighter crew , leaned against a wide metal pylon on his left . They were locked in a passionate embrace , oblivious to his presence . And oblivious to the snickers of a trio of adolescent boys in various stages of sartorial rebellion loping past , their long skirts catching between their gangly legs . Mack shook his head and sent a mental plea to the gods for understanding . And patience . He missed the orderly routine of the Vedritor . There was a loud whoop , then a high-pitched screech . His gaze automatically jerked to the right . A flash of bright yellow and blue hurtled quickly uplevel through the atrium 's center . His hand automatically swiveled his comm set 's thin mouth mike into position . " Makarian to ops . " " Ops . " A familiar male voice sounded in his earpiece . " Lieutenant Tobias . " " I thought we 'd solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , sir . " " I just left my office . " He sidestepped a merchant whose balding head barely topped the bolts of cloth stacked in his arms . Evidently someone was getting hard-goods deliveries . Where in hell were those uniforms ? " Main north , Tobias . Heading uplevel . The problem 's not solved . " " Logged and noted , sir . " He tapped off the mike , flicked it back down . Fleet crewmembers , whose uniforms showed mixed insignias , nodded respectfully as he passed . Stationers and freighter crew , whose clothing and demeanor showed an unholy mixture of unknown origin , simply ignored him . Janek 's sick bay was at D5-South , five levels down , on the opposite section of the ring . He headed for the stairs . Cirrus One 's lifts had been known to ignore him too . The lanky CMO turned from the med-stat panel when Mack stepped through the sliding doorway . " She 's in Exam Four . " A second sliding door ; this one ceased opening at the halfway point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman on the diag bed had her knees drawn up under the silver thermo-sheet and her arms wrapped around them . There was a flush of color on her pale cheeks , a slight curve on her lips . And an engaging , almost challenging tilt to her chin . She was , most definitely , beautiful . But young . Could n't be any more than twenty-five years old , though sick bay 's analytics transed to him earlier had stated early thirties . Something more than her youthfulness did n't fit the smuggler 's profile as he knew it . He could n't pinpoint what it was , but then his mind seemed very reluctant to focus on business at the moment . Janek moved to her bedside . She smiled , then her gaze found Mack . " This is Admiral Makarian , commander of the Fifth Fleet on Cirrus , " his CMO was saying , but Mack only half listened . The other half of him was unprofessionally captivated by the color of the young woman 's eyes . Green , yet lavender . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of her surprise was his age-he was the youngest admiral in Fleet history to date-or his uniform . His shirt , like Janek 's lab coat , still had the Vedritor 's insignia . The bars decorating his breast pocket showed only the three for senior captain . His admiral 's bars , like the requested uniforms , had not yet materialized . Now he wished they had . For some reason , he wanted to look his best in front of her . He shook off his uncharacteristic self-consciousness . She was just a smuggler . She was- " Gillaine Davre . " She leaned forward , extended one hand . No salute . Therefore she was n't military , or even ex-military . He took her hand , got a closer look at those eyes . Continues ...
