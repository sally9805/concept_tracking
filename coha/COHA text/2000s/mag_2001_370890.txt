If you want to find Peter Vitousek in his lab , the first thing you have to do is go to Hawaii . After that , it gets tricky , because Vitousek 's lab is n't in the state  --  it is the state . The Stanford University ecologist has devoted his career to studying the earth 's metabolism and life cycles , zeroing in on how the intricate machinery of its forests is altered by people and the introduction of new plants and animals . " Peter is a real visionary , " says marine ecologist Jane Lubchenco of Oregon State University . " It 's unusual to have someone who is simultaneously interested in the big picture and in taking a very detailed look at the processes themselves . " <P> Vitousek , 52 , did n't plan to spend his life tending to the planet 's health ; he began as a political science major . While a student at Amherst , however , he wrote a thesis on land use and stumbled across a book on biological invasions of pristine places . A native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute in his home state . All of Hawaii 's 20 species of flightless birds have vanished , and half the flying ones as well . One-sixth of the native plants are gone , and 30% of remaining ones are threatened . " I decided I wanted to be an ecologist , so I jumped into science classes to catch up , " he says . " I always intended to work in Hawaii . " <P> Now , decades later , the field is trying to catch up with him . Vitousek 's studies of the Hawaiian Islands  --  the world 's most remote archipelago and a place humans discovered only 1,500 years ago  --  have yielded some intriguing findings . While the arrival of new species has had the greatest impact on Hawaii 's unique flora and fauna , what amazed Vitousek was how the world reaches out to touch even the most remote spots . In one celebrated study , he and his colleagues analyzed soil and rock chemistry at volcanic sites ranging from 300 years to 4.1 million years old . Plants at the youngest sites drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more depleted sites survived on minerals blown in on sea spray and in dust from central Asia , thousands of miles away . " No ecosystem is entirely isolated , " he says . <P> Vitousek is currently focusing on the problem of global nitrogen , the element that makes up 80% of the atmosphere . Nitrogen is also found in fossil-fuel exhaust and is a principal ingredient in fertilizer . Spread too much of it around , and it can throw off the planet 's biological balance , triggering explosive growth in some species and suffocating others . " That 's a huge alteration in how the world works , " Vitousek says . " Our capacity to change the earth means we must manage this . " For a man who did n't even much care for science at first , that 's quite a mission . <P>  --  Reported by Andrea Dorfman/New York
