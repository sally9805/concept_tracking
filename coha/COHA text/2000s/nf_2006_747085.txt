The ability to select a previously viewed color specimen from an array of specimens that differ in hue , value , or chroma varies among individuals , and may be related to one 's basic color discrimination ability or to prior experience with color . This study investigated short-term color memory of 40 college students , 20 of whom were interior design majors and 20 who had no previous color-related education or professional experience . Color memory in four hue categories was tested separately using sets of Munsell color chips that consisted of a target color and nine distractors that were closely related to , but visibly different from the target color . After viewing the target color for 5 seconds , followed by a delay of an additional 5 seconds , each student was presented a set of 10 color chips and asked to identify the target color . Results revealed that the most accurately remembered color was yellow , followed by purple , orange , and green . Students with no prior color training more accurately remembered the color purple than did design majors , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Participants in the two groups reported the use of similar cues in remembering the target colors . INTRODUCTION <p> Among humans , there is a wide range of ability to distinguish color differences and to remember color . Uchikawa and Shinoda ( 1996 ) have indicated that the visual system has both the ability to discriminate small color differences and the ability to perceive different colors as the same , noting , for example , that the three distinct colors , blue-red , orange-red , and yellow-red , can all be described simply as " red " . <p> Color memory can be described as " successive color matching , " a category of color matching in which time elapses between the presentation of a color stimulus and the attempt to match the remembered color ( de Fez , Capilla , Luque , Perez-Carpinell , &; del Pozo , 2001 , Perez-Carpinell , Baldovi , de Fez , &; Castro , 1998 ) . One universal conclusion of color memory research over the past 100 years is that while some individuals seem to be able to retain a color in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that color memory is not consistent across the visible spectrum . Noting that certain colors have inherent differences that make them more difficult to remember than others , Collins ( 1931 ) conducted experiments in which subjects were asked to reproduce a previously seen color , and found that particular wavelengths of green and red were hard for the subjects to reproduce and also difficult to recognize again . This finding was confirmed by Hamwi and Landis ( 1955 ) , who also found that in addition to hue , ability to remember a color is also influenced by its lightness or darkness . Later , Nilson and Nelson ( 1981 ) found that the most accurately remembered colors were violets , green-blues , and yellow-oranges . However , more recent work ( Jin &; Shevell , 1996 ) demonstrated that long and medium wavelengths were remembered more accurately than shorter wavelengths . <p> The context in which a color is presented has also been shown to have an effect on the viewers ' ability to remember the color . In a study investigating the typicality of color to particular objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects shown in colors in which they are typically seen , the colors were remembered more accurately than when atypical colors were used . <p> Other research has shown that visual images such as color stimuli are remembered more easily than words , such as color names . Allen ( 1990 ) proposed that proactive inhibition is involved in color memory . Proactive inhibition is said to occur when a new and different method of encoding , or remembering , results from a change in the material to be remembered . In an experiment on memory of ambiguous color , Allen ( 1990 ) concluded that color names are encoded only verbally , while colors are encoded both verbally and perceptually , noting that a change from remembering color names to remembering color results in a release from proactive inhibition , as evidenced by an improved ability to remember . <p> Other findings by Perez-Carpinell , et al . ( 1998 ) indicate that women remember color more easily and more accurately than men . Among ten colors studied , orange was the easiest color to remember , whereas yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to remember overall . Comparing color memory by gender , men most easily remembered orange , dark blue , green , and red , while women showed better memory for orange , red , chamois , and violet . Furthermore , light colors were remembered as being lighter than they actually were , while dark colors were incorrectly remembered as being darker ( Perez-Carpinell , et al. , 1998 ) . <p> Time between stimulus and recall was also found to have a significant effect on memory , with the accuracy of color memory diminishing rapidly as the elapsed time increased between intervals of zero , 15 s , 5 min , and 24 hr ( Perez-Carpinell , et al. , 1998 ) . However , Nilson and Nelson ( 1981 ) found no significant difference for delays between 0.1 and 24.3 seconds . Using longer delays of 15 min , 24 hr , and 64 hr , Hamwi and Landis ( 1955 ) found no relationship between time delay and color memory . <p> Studies that addressed effects of subjects ' prior training or experience with color on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 chips from the Farnsworth-Munsell color test , Burnham and Clark ( 1955 ) did not find prior color experience or training to be significant . However , earlier work ( Collins , 1931 ) with a questionably small sample of only six subjects had shown that trained subjects had more accurate color memory . <p> The primary purpose of our study was to examine the effect of prior color training or professional experience on short-term color memory of college students . In effect , we examined differences between the ability of design majors ( color-trained ) and non-design majors ( non-color-trained ) to correctly recognize/identify colors on a retention test . Another purpose was to examine incorrectly remembered colors to determine whether there is a consistent direction of hue , value , or chroma shift between the target and the remembered color . A third objective was to explore and investigate whether students used word cues or visual cues in attempting to remember colors . Method <p> Color Stimuli <p> Munsell dimensions ( hue , value , and chroma ) were used to select colors for the study . Color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , and purple ) were selected from the Munsell Book of Color ( matte finish ) . Each set included a target color and nine distractor colors . The Munsell designations for the four target colors were 2.5Y 8/8 , 7.5YR 7/8 , 10G 6/6 , and 5P 5/6 . The Munsell locations of the distractor colors with respect to the target colors were the same for each of the four sets . In each set , five distractor chips were chosen from the same Munsell hue designation as the target chip , two distractors were chosen from the two immediately preceding hue pages and two from the two immediately following hue pages . Each distractor was within two Munsell hue , value , or chroma steps of the target color . This resulted in sets of distractors that were closely related to , but visibly different from the target color . The Munsell designations of the distractors for each target color are shown in Table 1 . Each color chip measured 17 mm x 20 nun and was mounted on a 5 cm x 5 cm white card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specimen from deterioration due to excessive handling . <p> Participants <p> Forty female college students between 18 and 25 years of age were recruited from a public institution in the southeast region of the US . Twenty were interior design majors who had studied color either in a specific color course or in a design principle course . The remaining twenty had no previous color-related education or professional experience , and represented a wide range of academic majors other than design . The objective and test procedure were explained to each student prior to participation . Each student completed the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test , and all were found to have normal color vision and at least average color discrimination ability . <p> Procedure <p> The experiment was conducted under standard illuminant D65 in a Macbeth spectralight box . The subject was handed the target color chip and asked to look at it with the intent of remembering it . After 5 seconds , the target specimen was removed . Then , after focusing on a standard white paper card for 5 seconds , the subject was handed a stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nine distractors , randomly arranged , and was asked to recall and choose the target color . Finally , after identifying what was thought to be the correct target color , the subject was asked what method she may have used in trying to remember the test color , i.e. , whether the subject tried to remember the color by assigning it a verbal description or by using associations with mental images of objects having the same color . Results <p> The results are summarized in the Tables . Yellow was the most accurately remembered color , with 29 of the 40 students accurately selecting the target . Next was purple , then orange ( Munsell " yellow-red " ) , and finally , the least accurately identified color was green , correctly chosen by only five participants . Considering design and non-design majors separately , yellow was the most accurately identified color and green was the least accurately identified color by both groups , but for the design majors , orange ranked second in number of correct matches , while purple was the second most accurately matched color for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the color yellow . For the target color yellow , the distractors selected by the design majors differed from the target only in hue . Similar results were found for the non-majors , except that one subject chose a distractor that differed from the target in value and chroma , but not in hue . For the orange target ( see Table 3 ) , all except two chosen distractors differed from the target only in hue . One design major selected a distractor which differed from the target only in chroma , and one non-design major selected a target which differed in both value and chroma . <p> For the green target ( see Table 4 ) , the majority of the distractors for both groups differed from the target in hue . The exceptions among the design majors were one whose choice differed from the target in value and chroma and one whose choice differed only in chroma . Among the non-design majors , there were three exceptions whose selections differed from the target in both value and chroma . In the case of purple ( see Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differed from the target in hue only . Exceptions were two design major students who selected a distractor that differed from the target in both value and chroma . <p> In response to the question of what cues were used to remember the color , most of the respondents stated that they used either words or visual associations with objects of the same color . Some of the students indicated that they used both types of cues . As shown in Table 6 , design majors and non-majors ' choices were almost identical with respect to cue category primarily used , with both groups indicating greater use of visual cues . The maximum number of correct matches that were possible in the study was 160 ( 40 subjects x 4 colors ) . Of the 64 total correct matches that were made , the participants primarily used visual cues in 40 cases , while word cues were primarily used by 24 . Discussion <p> The purpose of this study was to test color memory in four hue categories , including yellow , yellow-red ( orange ) , green and purple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confirming the findings of previous studies by Perez-Carpinell , et al . ( 1998 ) and Collins ( 1931 ) green was the least correctly remembered color for both groups . Contrary to the previous studies by Perez-Carpinell , et al . ( 1998 ) , but confirming the findings of Collins ( 1931 ) , yellow was the most correctly remembered color . <p> The learning ( or practice ) effect found by Collins ( 1931 ) and by Hamwi and Landis ( 1955 ) , did not occur . On the contrary , most participants correctly identified the first color presented and tended to be less accurate for colors presented later . To further investigate this , future research should involve a larger number of participants with the order of presentation of colors fully randomized . <p> Furthermore , there was no strong difference between the design and non-design majors in overall ability to correctly retain colors in short-term memory . This observation confirms the findings of Burnham and Clark ( 1955 ) , who concluded that immediate memory for a hue is not much affected by specific training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TABLE Table 2 Yellow Color Match Selections by Group PREFORMATTED TABLE Table 3 Orange Color Match Selections by Group PREFORMATTED TABLE Table 4 Green Color Match Selections by Group PREFORMATTED TABLE Table 5 Purple Color Match Selections by Group PREFORMATTED TABLE Table 6 Correct Color Selections by Memory Cue Types and Group PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
