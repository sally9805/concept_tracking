During an eight-year stint with the San Francisco Giants , he has been named Manager of the Year three times // IN San Francisco , the long-legged man zooming down Highway 280 on his custom-made motorcycle-the wind tickling his goateed face-is the vision of contentment . His expression paints a picture of total serenity-no worries , no concerns , nothing but a strong sense of satisfaction . These trips-some short , some hours long-are what he refers to as his " special time " - the time to unwind , to reflect and to enjoy the freedom that comes with being on his so-called " Rastamobile , " a red , green , black and yellow Harley-Davidson , with profiles of Bob Marley on the gas tank and his helmet . That 's one side of Johnnie B. Baker Jr . But with his " Rastamobile " parked outside Pacific Bell Park , he slips into his No.12 uniform and another side emerges-the one that baseball fans have come to know as Dusty Baker , the history-making manager of the San Francisco Giants who is fast becoming one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and an uncanny ability to get more production out of his players than is generally expected . That combination already has placed him on a pedestal by himself . After leading the Giants to a major-league-best 97-65 record last year , he became the only National League manager to win the prestigious Manager of the Year award an unprecedented third time . " It 's an honor to win this award three times in eight years . I feel fortunate to have done that , " says Baker , who received the first award in 1993 , his first season as manager , and the second following the 1997 season . " This shows what can happen if you get a chance . I get the credit for what we 've done here , but this is not my award ; it 's our award . Everybody on this team had something to do with it , and I mean everybody .

One of the game 's most engaging personalities , Baker ( light ) has become a big crowd favorite . Photograph // Be that as it may , onlookers continue to see something different-something unique-in Baker , and they wonder why he is so good at what he does-good enough to find a spot in the history books . Giants left fielder and three-time National League MVP Barry Bonds says it 's basically Baker 's personality and his knowledge of the players on the team . " Hey , man , he 's the best . When you win Manager of the Year three times , there 's something special about you , " says Bonds , who was last year 's National League MVP runner-up . " He demands respect and gets respect in return . For me , a manager who can get the best out of a bad team is a great manager . I 've seen Dusty do that .

Photograph // And he 's been able to do that for a variety of reasons . Baker 's described as -a players ' manager , " one who has played the game and understands the day-to-day problems of players , and he uses that unique perspective to guide them in the right direction Additionally , he has a gift of attraction ; people like to be near him , and that makes it easy for players to give maximum effort for him . When talking about Baker , players use words like intelligent , modest , honest , charismatic and sensitive to describe him . As a manager , he sees himself as an instructor who is teaching his players the ways of playing winning baseball . And to do that , he says , he must have their trust . That 's why he has taken some unique steps to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the road , he 'll take players to his favorite soul food restaurant , and they 'll sit and talk baseball with one another and other patrons . Aside from those intimate gatherings and Baker 's people skills that can rival those of a diplomat , the 52-year-old is well-rounded enough to relate to each player on a variety of levels . If it 's music , he can talk about almost anyone from Stevie Wonder to Bonnie Raitt to Van Morrison to Jill Scott to Tupac Shakur to blues legend John Lee Hooker , who he pals around with sometimes to talk music and baseball . If it 's literature , he can talk about a wide array of authors , particularly W.E.B . DuBois and Malcolm X. ( It would n't have surprised his friends if he had joined the Black Muslims during the era of the Vietnam War . ) He speaks fluent Spanish , another plus on a team with several Latin players . Baker has used all of those qualities to relate to his players . But perhaps his best quality is his ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cohesive , winning unit . He has been able to do that primarily , he says , because the players know that he wo n't lie to them . " I think the younger guys now need somebody who they can talk to , somebody they can respect , " he says , " probably more now than at any time since I 've been in the game . " Dusty 's tenure as a player in the major leagues began in 1968 with the Atlanta Braves , where he teamed with his boyhood hero , Hank Aaron , until Baker was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1975 . It was there that he enjoyed the glory years of his career , becoming a two-time All-Star outfielder and eventually being voted to the all-time Dodger team by fans during the club 's 100th anniversary celebration in 1990 . He finished his playing days in 1986 , after stints with San Francisco and the Oakland A 's . Looking back , Baker classifies that part of his career as " a dream , " one that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif , his parents , Johnnie Baker Sr. and his wife Christine , had constantly preached to the oldest of their five children about the merits of dedication , discipline , determination and hard work Dusty ( who got the nickname from his mother because he spent a lot of time playing on the ground ) saw his father work full days as an Air Force sheet-metal technician at Norton Air Force Base , come home to get a few minutes sleep then go to his second job , which was anything that allowed him to make some extra money-selling TVs at Sears , cutting lawns , roofing . Photograph At spring training in Scottsdale , Ariz. , Baker gets a helping hand from his 2-year-old son , Darren . // That work ethic rubbed off on Baker and served him during his playing days , and it continues to be evident during a managerial career that has set new standards for other managers to follow . But even though he has blossomed into one of the most respected managers in the major leagues and has seen the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's a realist who knows that , despite his credentials , there still are some teams that would never give him a chance to manage . " Years after Al Campanis " statement about Blacks not having " necessities " to manage in the big leagues , we also have seen Don Baylor and Jerry Manuel win Manager of the Year , and Cito Gaston has won two championships , " Baker says . " But even with that in mind , in some cities , the members of the country clubs , Rotary clubs , and the press and fans just wo n't accept having a Black manager . My mother always told me : Son , as long as you 're Black , you 'll have to prove yourself over and over and over again . You 'll have to be twice as good . ' And sometimes that 's not enough . " Many observers believe Dusty is twice as good , and after last season , the Giants rewarded his leadership with a two-year , $5.25 million contract that makes him one of the highest-paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker , who is the classic outdoorsman , with hunting and fishing at the top of his list . At home , there is special time spent with his wife , Melissa , and their 2-year-old son , Darren , who has put a new kind of sparkle in his father 's eyes . ( Baker has a 21-year-old daughter , Natosha , from his first marriage . ) Then there 's his involvement in the community , which has earned him several awards for his humanitarian efforts . Working in conjunction with Mayor Willie Brown 's office , Baker has become involved in a number of programs to lend a helping hand . " The more you do , " he says , " the more you see how much people need help . " If Dusty had his way , he would offer a different kind of help to former players who no longer have contact with the game . Their renewed involvement , he says , would benefit everyone associated with Major League Baseball . " I 'd like to see the game come up with a consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still have knowledge of the game , even though they might have lost some of their physical ability and stamina , " he says . " There 's nothing wrong with their brains , and they can make a huge contribution-helping youngsters learn how to continue to play the game the right way and how to conduct themselves as professionals . Additionally , I 'd like to see the game conduct history lessons to show young players how they got to the point they are now . " With a strong appreciation for history himself , Baker knows what it took for him to get to the plateau of elite managers , and he has n't forgotten those who paved the way for him . Now he wants to be sure to take the right steps to make it easier for those who follow him . " This whole thing is about winning championships , " he says . " When we win that title , that 'll make it easier for everybody . " <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
