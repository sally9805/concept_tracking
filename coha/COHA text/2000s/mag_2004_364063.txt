Along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan , there is no shortage of spies and informers . In that mountain lair where al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives are burrowed in amid local tribes that pay little heed to the government in Islamabad , at least five rival Pakistani agencies run networks in search of Osama bin Laden and his cohort . The snitches seemed to have come up with gold last week . TIME has learned that Pakistani troops , already engaged in an offensive to flush out foreign fighters , pounced on an informer 's tip that al-Qaeda sympathizers were hiding with foreign militants in the village of Kalosha . Before dawn last Tuesday , 400 members of Pakistan 's Frontier Corps swooped in , only to be ambushed by heavy fire ; at least 22 troops died . In response , Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ordered 8,000 troops to converge on a cluster of villages deep in South Waziristan , drawing a cordon around 20 sq . mi. of hills and apple orchards dotted with mud fortresses . Somewhere inside , Musharraf announced , his forces had surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources were giving the target a name : Ayman al-Zawahiri , the No. 2 leader of al-Qaeda and bin Laden 's closest aide . <P> The Army 's spokesman , Major General Shaukat Sultan , acknowledged that no one had definitively spotted al-Zawahiri in the area since fighting flared on Tuesday . Lieut . General Safdar Hussain , the Frontier Corps commander , told journalists that a vehicle that may have been carrying al-Zawahiri managed to crash through militia roadblocks and escape . Yet what made the military believe they might still have a trophy in their gunsights was that al-Qaeda fighters normally vanish when confronted with a sizable force . This time they resisted fiercely , as if to protect someone special . Somewhere between 200 and 400 militants kept 8,000 Pakistani soldiers half a mile away with a steady barrage of small-arms fire , anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades . After a day of battle , the army commander called in helicopter gunships , jets and artillery . By Saturday night a cloud of dust hung over the area , but the army had still not defeated the militants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sultan . " Nobody will escape . " <P> As the battle raged , Bush Administration officials played down expectations . Officials said U.S. intelligence could not confirm reports of al-Zawahiri 's whereabouts . But the possibility that he might be cornered sent pulses racing . Since the late ' 90s , the Egyptian has served as bin Laden 's chief tactician , personal doctor and spiritual guide . His elimination would mean the al-Qaeda command structure that plotted the 9/11 attacks would be almost completely wiped out .
