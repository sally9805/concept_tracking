<p> Coach Don Haskins never thought of himself as being racially colorblind . <p> When his Texas Western Miners defeated Adolph Rupp 's University of Kentucky Wildcats for the 1966 NCAA championship , it never occurred to him to put anybody but his best players on the court . It just happened that his five starters were black , which , prior to that moment , was unheard of in a national championship game . <p> By taking that step , Haskins , then 36 , set in motion the desegregation of college basketball teams in the South . <p> Miami Heat coach Pat Riley , one of the stars on that Kentucky team , calls the game " the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966 . " <p> The story of the driven , demanding , tunnel-visioned Haskins ; his tough , relentless Texas Western Miners players ; and the obstacles they overcame are brought to light in Glory Road , opening nationwide Friday . <p> " No matter where I travel , people come up and thank me for starting five black players , " writes Haskins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 NCAA Basketball Championship and How One Team Triumphed Against the Odds and Changed America Forever , released in conjunction with the movie . " I 'd be somewhere , decades later , and all of a sudden a black man would come up to me and want to shake my hand and thank me because after the 1966 game , schools throughout the country began integrating and he got a scholarship somewhere because of it . ... This kind of stuff would blow my mind . It was incredible . All I ever sought out to do was win the game . I certainly did not expect to be some racial pioneer or change the world . " <p> Within a week of winning the championship , Haskins was barraged by hate mail . <p> Writes Haskins : " I 've said this many times over the last 40 years , but for a long time I thought winning the national championship was the worst thing ever to happen to me . I wished for a long time that we had never won that game with Kentucky because life would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my school and my players . " <p> Haskins , who never left Texas Western ( later renamed Texas-El Paso ) , retired from coaching in 1999 after 719 wins and seven Western Athletic Conference championships . He was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997  --  he received a recommendation letter from Riley . <p> The 1965-66 Miners gathered in Los Angeles last week for the premiere of Glory Road . Haskins stayed behind in El Paso for health reasons .

" <p> His dunk on Kentucky 's Pat Riley : " There was a dunk at the beginning of the game . Pat was the recipient of the dunk that was intended to send a message to the Kentucky team : ' Here were are , and we 're here to win . ' " <p> What he learned from Coach Haskins : " What I learned from him was discipline . It helped my structure in business and in life . It 's what I teach my kids and my grandkids . " <p> What the movie means to him : " It 's done a lot to make me feel proud to know that I 've done something good .

" <p> How the game changed his life : " People would see what you accomplished and what the significance of it was . They knew how hard it was to go through a whole season under the pressures we were under and still be successful , and they 'd say , ' That 's the kind of person I want working for me . ' " <p> What Coach Haskins taught him : " I learned to always believe in yourself and never let anybody tell you what you ca n't do . If you believe that you can do it , then you take whatever steps you have to take to accomplish what it is you want to accomplish . " <p> What his teammates mean to him : " I love these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baudoin , Jerry Armstrong and Togo Railey , and they changed a lot of my perceptions of white people . Growing up , I had a negative one because of what I had to go through and because of what I saw other black people go through . In our freshman year , we played at Roswell , N.M. , and they would not let us eat at a restaurant . Those three guys said , ' If they ca n't eat here , we ca n't eat here . ' We went down the street , and we found this little hamburger joint . Louis walked up to the proprietor and asked him if his friends could eat here . He did n't say , ' Can these colored players eat here ? ' He said , ' My friends . ' And that meant an awful lot to me . They had a lot to do with my thinking now .

" <p> Why the racial makeup of the starting five was n't on his mind : " If we would 've went into that game thinking about who we had to play because of their color , I do n't think you would be sitting here trying to talk to me . We knew our character , our personality , the team concept we had . We overcame issues and controversies that were heavy . Racism was a big thing back then . I often felt bad that there were African-Americans in certain places that really could n't jump up and shout , ' Hey ! Texas Western won ! ' They had to cheer behind closed doors , scared that if they would 've gone out , their lives would 've been in jeopardy . Today , we have the freedom to sing our song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How Coach Haskins affected him : " When I played for him , I hated him . God knows , I hated the man . I was his whipping dog . I asked a lot of times , today and even yesterday , ' Why was he on me so much ? ' I realize now that he knew I had the ability to be a good athlete . He felt it was worth the effort to try to get the best out of me . " <p> What the movie means to him : " My kids say , ' If it was n't for what you and your teammates did , a lot of ballplayers would n't have gotten where they are so soon . ' When my children said that , I was so humbled . It made me even prouder .

' Or , ' Oh , I was overseas and I saw you play . ' And their comments , in black terminology , always were , ' Brother , you did a hell of a job . ' " <p> What Coach Haskins means to him : " He taught me a lot of things that I now appreciate . But as I was going through it , he was a mean SOB . We laugh at it now . He taught us discipline .

To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it 's coming out that we all graduated and are great citizens . " <p> What Coach Haskins taught him : " Practices were from hell . On the floor , you got to the point where you wanted to quit every day . You got to the point where sometimes you hated him . But off the floor , he always treated me great . Right now , I look back on the times and , yes , they were hard , but he taught me a lot about life . I took a lot of his coaching philosophy and instilled it into my coaching philosophy . He knew the game of basketball and was way ahead of his time in recruiting black athletes . " <p> What the movie means to him : " When we had the premiere in El Paso in late November , I flew in both of my sons and their wives and four grandchildren ( ages 7-15 ) .

Even though we saw cities burning , we were basketball players . ... As I got into the NBA and players began to speak to me about that game , I started to realize the significance of it . When Bob McAdoo came to me as a player , when I was coaching the ( Los Angeles ) Lakers and said , ' I remember that game . It was the turning point of my life . ' He was a player in North Carolina , a very highly touted player , and because of that game and the courage he garnered from those players , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How the game changed Adolph Rupp : " I love him like the Texas Western players love Don Haskins .

Because he was the pillar of coaching integrity in national collegiate basketball , everybody left it to him . Everybody pointed the finger to him , to be the first man to have to integrate . He was a basketball coach and was simply trying to get players to put the ball in the hoop . " <p> Being dunked on by David Lattin : " To me , it 's humorous now . My players are always on me about that , but at least I tried to contest the shot .
