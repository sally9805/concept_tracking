Prologue In which a Proposal of marriage is Received . Spring , 1821 Signorina Alessandri was ill . Again . With one hand restraining the flowing folds of her fine silk nightclothes , she lurched over the closestool in her Covent Garden flat and prayed , in fluent and fervid Italian , for death to take her . " Oh , please , miss , do speak English ! " begged her maid , who had caught her heavy black hair , and drawn it back , too . " I ca n't make out a word . But I do think we 'd best fetch a doctor . " " Nonsense , " said the signorina , clenching the back of the closestool in a white-knuckled fist . " It was the fish Lord Chesley served last night . " The maid pursed her lips . " Aye , and what was it yesterday , miss ? " she asked . " Not fish , I 'll wager . " With the other hand set at the small of her back , Viviana closed her eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said softly . " We talk of it no further . The worst is over now . " " Oh , I doubt that , " said the maid . Viviana ignored her and went instead to the washbasin . " Where is the morning 's post , per favore ? " she asked , awkwardly slopping the bowl full of water . With a sigh , Lucy went into the parlor and returned with a salver which held one letter covered in Viviana 's father 's infamous scrawl , and a folded note which bore no address . " Mr. Hewitt 's footman brought it , " she said offhandedly . With hands that shook , Viviana finished her ablutions , then patted a towel across her damp face as her maid looked on in consternation . The girl had been both loyal and kind these many months . " Thank you , Lucy , " she said . " Why do you not go have a cup of tea ? I shall read my letter now . " Lucy hesitated . " But do you not wish your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T is already past noon . Mr. Hewitt will be here soon , wo n't he ? " Quin . Lucy was right , of course . Viviana laid aside the towel and took the note . Quin usually came to her in the early afternoon . Yes , just as he meant to do today . And oh , how she longed for it  --  yet dreaded it in the same breath . She tossed the note into the fire . She had not missed the furious looks he 'd hurled her way in the theater 's reception room after last night 's performance . Viviana had sung gloriously , hitting every high note in her last aria with a chilling , crystal-clear resonance , before collapsing into her lover 's arms in a magnificent swoon . The theater had been full , the applause thunderous . But all Quin had seemed to notice was what had come afterward . The compliments and congratulations of her admirers . The champagne toasts . The subtle , sexual invitations tossed her way by the lift of a brow or a tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . It had not been refusal enough for Quin . One could hardly have ignored his cocky stance and sulky sneer as he paced the worn green carpet , a glass of brandy clutched in his hand . His uncle , Lord Chesley , had even had the effrontery to tease him about it . Quin had not taken that well . Nor had he been especially pleased to see Viviana leaving on Chesley 's arm , as she so often did . And today , God help them , he would undoubtedly wish to quarrel over it . Viviana was not at all sure she was capable of mounting a spirited defense . But it almost did n't matter anymore . " Miss ? " said the maid . " Your bathwater ? " Nausea roiled in her stomach again , and Viviana moved gingerly to a chair . " In ten minutes , Lucy , " she answered . " I shall read Pap 's letter whilst my stomach settles . If I am late , I shall receive Mr. Hewitt here . " Lucy pursed her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " But I 'd be telling him straightaway , miss , about that bad fish if I was you . " Finally , Viviana laughed . The fleeting humor did not sustain her as she opened her father 's letter . Even the scent of his letter paper tugged at her heartstrings . She knew the very drawer of his desk from which it had been taken ; the same desk in which he kept his tobacco . Then there was the penmanship itself . The broad , slashing strokes always recalled to her his indefatigable strength , the tight loops and curls , his wisdom and precision , and the lyrical words , his artistry . He was one of Europe 's most renowned composers , and not without reason . She drew in the scent once more , then spread the letter across her lap . She read it through once , disbelievingly , then again , very carefully . Chesley , it seemed , had kept his old friend well-informed . Already Pap knew that tonight was to be her last performance in Die Entfhrung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her feet . As Konstanze , at long last , she had triumphed . And now Pap was writing to tell her she might return home . Viviana closed her eyes and thought of it . Dear God , what a strange confluence of fate and timing this was ! It seemed an eternity since she had fled Venice with nothing but her panic , her violin , and her music folio to bear her company . And now , to return ! Oh , it was what she had lived for and longed for almost every moment since , save for those spent in Quin 's arms . He had been , in truth , her salvation . But now she could go home . It was a bit of a devil 's bargain , what was being offered her . Certainly it was not what she wanted . Nonetheless , as Pap pointed out , there were advantages to such an arrangement . Great advantages . It would also make his life a vast deal easier , though her father would sooner die than tell her so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be forced upon her . Ha ! Those were not her father 's words , she 'd wager . Apparently , Conte Bergonzi had changed his tactics . Moreover , Viviana could tell by his careful phrasing that Pap fully expected her to refuse Bergonzi 's offer , and would forgive her if she did so . Viviana set her hand on her belly . She was not at all sure she would have the luxury of refusing . The water was wonderfully hot when it came , and remarkably restorative . Feeling perhaps a little more at peace , Viviana was still luxuriating in it when Quin came stalking into the room . He looked at once angry and yet almost boyishly uncertain . He stared down at her naked body and gave her a tight , feral smile . " Washing away the evidence , Vivie ? " It was a cynical remark , even for him . For a moment , she let her black eyes burn into him . " Silenzio , Quinten , " she returned . " I had quite enough of your jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He knelt by the tub , and rested one arm along its edge . His eyes were bleak today , the lines about his mouth almost shockingly deep for one so young . He smelled of brandy and smoke and the scents of a long , hard-spent night . " Is that what you want , Viviana ? " he whispered . " Are you trying to drive me away ? " She dropped her soap into the water . " How , Quin ? " she demanded , throwing up her hands in frustration . " Mio dio , how am I doing this driving ? I am not , and that is the truth of it , si ? " He cast his eyes away , as if he did not believe her . " They say Lord Lauton has promised you a house in Mayfair , and more money than I could ever dream of , " he answered . " Not until I come into my title , at any rate . Is it true , Vivie ? " She shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she returned . " I am no longer for sale  --  perhaps not even to you . Why must you be so jealous ? " " How can I help but be , Viviana ? " he rasped , brushing one finger beneath her left nipple . It peaked and hardened , begging for his touch . " Men 's eyes feast upon you everywhere you go . But at least you still desire me . " Viviana glowered at him , but she did not push his hand away . " My body desires you , si , " she admitted . " But sometimes , amore mio , my mind does not . " He plucked the nipple teasingly between his thumb and forefinger . " And what of your heart , Viviana ? " he whispered , looking up at her from beneath a sweep of inky lashes . " I have your body ensconced , ever so circumspectly , in this flat which I have paid for . Have I your heart as well ? " " I have no heart ! " she snapped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , if you will recall . And you need not remind me , Quin , of who has put this roof over my head . I have become mindful of it with every breath I draw . " As if to torment her , he let his lashes fall shut , then leaned forward to crook his head so that he might suckle her . Viviana sat perfectly still , allowing him to draw her nipple into his mouth , and then between his teeth . At that , she gasped , and cursed the old , familiar pull of lust which went twisting traitorously through her body . It curled deep in her belly and left her breathless . He lifted his head with a satisfied smile . " Where did you go last night , my love ? " he asked . She looked at him defiantly . " To Chesley 's town house , " she said . " We dined with Lord and Lady Rothers , and some acquaintances they had brought from Paris . " " Ah , patrons of the arts , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quin almost mockingly . " My uncle 's little coterie ! " " Why must you so often think ill of him ? He is kind to me , no more . " " My uncle is a fine man , " Quin returned . " It is his friends I do not trust . By the way , my sweet , what is this here , just below your jaw ? A bruise ? Or something else ? " Her glower darkened as he brushed the side of her neck with the back of one finger . " It is absolutely nothing , " she snapped , having no need to look . He was trying to elicit some sort of guilty reaction . " It is nothing , as it has always been nothing , Quin , " she went on . " Chesley is my father 's friend . My mentor here in London . He thinks of me as his ward , for God 's sake ! How many times must we suffer this foolish argument ? " He broke his gaze , and looked away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He choked out the words . " You  --  you drive me insane . Chesley runs with a fast crowd . I can not bear how those other men look at you . " " And how , pray , am I to stop it ? " she asked him . " What would you have me do , Quin ? Give up my career ? Enter a convent ? I am a singer , for God 's sake , and for that , one needs an audience . " She seized her towel from the floor with a snap and pushed him away . " I  --  I could pay you , " he said . " A little now , and a great deal more  --  eventually . Then you would not have to sing at all . " She looked at him incredulously . " Sometimes , Quin , I do not think you understand me , " she whispered . " I must sing . It has nothing to do with money . " He watched her almost warily as she stood to towel the water from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nakedness from his heated gaze as it drifted over her . She was , after all , his . He had bought and paid for her . She had let him do it , too  --  though she had fought it at first like a tigress . " Lie down on the bed , Viviana , " he said when she was dry . " Open your legs . I want you . " For a moment , she considered refusing . But God help her , she still desired him . Even though it had come to this . She had wounds and scars to last a lifetime , as , no doubt , did he . Petty jealousies and bitterness had eaten into their hearts . He was too young . Too inexperienced . And she  --  well , she was simply too lonely . They were just using one another now . Surely he understood that ? Certainly , she did . Yet she craved the pleasure and the peace his virile young body could give her . She craved him . And she remembered a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain her ; a time when they had worshipped one another , and experienced together all the sweet delights of a first love . " Lie down on the bed , " he said again , more firmly . " You are my mistress , Viviana . I have the right . " And that , too , was perfectly true . Viviana tossed aside the towel , drew back the sheets , and did as he asked . As the early-afternoon light spilt over his shoulder , Quin stripped off his clothes with the practiced ease of a man who was used to having his needs and whims accommodated . He was already hard and fully erect . As usual . When his snug , buff trousers had been shucked and tossed aside , he crawled across the bed in an almost predatory fashion and mounted her without preamble . Viviana gasped at the invasion , her whole body arching upward . " You are mine , Viviana , " he whispered , thrusting the full length of his erection inside her . " Do not ever forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not argue . Instead , she set her feet flat against the bed , and tilted up her hips to better take the deepening strokes . In response , he clasped her hands in his , palm to palm , and pushed them high over her head and onto the bed pillows , holding them there as he rode her . They had become like cats in heat , she and Quin , hissing and squabbling even as they burnt for one another . She could already feel the quickening in his body  --  and in hers , too , despite the hurt he had done her . What manner of woman was she , to crave and cling to this ? It was as if Quin read her very thoughts . " You are mine , Viviana , " he growled , bending over her and staring into her eyes , still pressing her hands high above her head . " You are mine , damn it , and no one else 's . Say it . " Viviana turned her head away . It was not worth the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look at me , Viviana , " he insisted , quickening his thrusts . " Look at me when I do this to you . Sometimes , I swear , I think you mean to break my heart . Say it again . You are mine , and no one else 's ! " She returned her gaze to his , defiant . " I am mine , Quin , " she said , her voice low and tremulous . " I am my own person . But I have chosen to be with you . There is a difference . " But Quin seemed not to hear her words . He had closed his own eyes now , and the flesh was taut across the hard bones of his face as he rode her more furiously . She felt her pelvis arch to his against her will , urgent and greedy . Oh , God , he had such a gift for this ! She wanted to lose herself in this pure , physical act . Wanted to feel nothing but the joining of their bodies . He sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way , at least , he understood her . " Si , caro mio , " she crooned . " Ah , yes . Like that . " Sweat had beaded on his temples . His face was etched with strain , stark and beautiful . " God , Vivie ! " he groaned . " Oh , God , I worship you ! " She jerked her hands from beneath his , and clutched at him , gasping for breath . He thrust again and again , harder still , then one last sweet , perfect stroke . Viviana cried out , her whole body trembling . The pleasure washed over her , engulfed her , drowning out common sense . He fell across her body , his chest heaving , the weight of him bearing her down into the softness of the bed . She stroked one hand down his taut , well-muscled back and felt tears spring to her eyes . " Oh , amore mio , " she murmured . " Oh , ti amo , Quin . Ti amo . " And in that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her heart , though she had never once allowed herself to say the words  --  not in any language he could comprehend . Soothed and spent , she simply listened to the sound of his breathing for a time . It was the simplest of pleasures , she had discovered , to lie in the arms of a beautiful man  --  no , this man  --  sated and happy , and simply listen . But the peace , of course , did not last . Soon they were quarreling again about the events of last night . Quin had apparently taken note of every man who had so much as kissed her hand or fetched her a glass of champagne . It was foolish , almost sophomoric behavior which had worsened with her ascending fame , and Viviana gave no quarter . She had reached her wit 's end , and she told him so . Quin reacted badly . " God , how I hate the way we must live ! " he finally shouted . " I have the right to protect you . I have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . " " Quin , amore mio , we have been through this a thousand times , " she whispered . " Such news would kill my father . He did not sacrifice everything to send me to England so that I might become a rich man 's mistress . " Indeed , her father had sent her for precisely the opposite reason . But there was no point in saying as much to Quin . It would only serve to make him angrier . " Signor Alessandri does not worry about this fast theater crowd his daughter runs with ? " he retorted . " He does not care whose eyes are undressing you ? And Lord Rothers ! Good God , Vivie ! His patronage comes at a price . He has bedded half the actresses in the West End . " " Well , he has n't bedded me , " she returned . " Nor will he . Nor does he wish to . My God , Quin , he was with his wife . What do you think happened ? A mnage trois on Chesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he moved as if to turn his back on her . " Yes , go ahead . Make a jest of it , Viviana . Make a jest of me . " She laid a hand against his chest . " Oh , caro mio , you are so young ! " He turned back to her at once . " Damn it , Vivie , I hate when you say that ! " he swore . " Stop acting as if I 'm some ignorant pup . I 'm almost one-and-twenty now . " " Yes , and we agreed , Quin , at the start of this  --  " " I know , dash it ! " he interjected , laying his hand over hers and squeezing it almost violently . " I know . I shall keep my word , Viviana . But I bloody well do n't like it . " A heavy silence fell across Viviana 's bedchamber for a time , broken only by the distant clamor of Covent Garden beyond their windows . Eventually , however , she rolled onto her stomach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had done so often at the start of their tumultuous relationship . Dear heaven , but he was beautiful , this half man , half boy she had come to love with such a breathless intensity . And she realized , quite suddenly , that despite it all , she could not bear to lose him . Even after all the harsh words  --  plenty of them , on both sides  --  she could not imagine a life without Quin . But was there any hope ? She prayed there was , and not just for herself . " Quin , caro mio , " she said impulsively . " Tell me something . Where is life going to take you ? " He lifted his head from the pillow , and looked up at her strangely . " What do you mean , Vivie ? " Viviana shrugged lamely . " I am not perfectly sure , " she said . " Have you ever considered ... oh , going away , perhaps ? Abroad , I mean ? " " Abroad ? " he said bemusedly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent ? " Viviana lifted her brows . " To Venice or Rome , perhaps ? " He laughed . " Why on earth would anyone leave England ? " Viviana felt a prick of anger . " Perhaps because it is a stifling , moralizing place ? " " Vivie , it is my home , " he said , stroking a hand down her hair . " Let 's have no more talk of anyone going anywhere , all right ? " " But what of your future , Quin ? " she persisted . " What do you mean to do with your life ? " " Live it , I daresay , " he returned . " What else is one to do ? " " But have you ever thought that we might  --  " She stopped and swallowed hard . " Have you ever thought , Quin , of ... of marriage ? " His eyes widened . " Good God , " he said . " To you ? " She tore her gaze away . " To ... to someone that you worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , to me . " His expression gentled . " Oh , Vivie , " he whispered . " Oh , if only life were so simple . " She pressed on , fully conscious of the hurt her pride would endure . " Perhaps it is that simple , Quin , " she answered . " You say you can not live without me . That you wish to claim me as yours . I ask you , how badly do you wish for this ? " He cut her a sidelong glance . " Is that what all this hesitance is about ? " he asked . " Are you holding out for marriage ? Oh , Viviana ! You knew I could n't marry you when we started this . Did n't you ? " Viviana shook her head . " I am not holding out , Quin , " she answered . " It is not like that . " But Quin was still looking at her incredulously . " For God 's sake , Viviana , I 'm heir to an earldom , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is ? When I must finally wed  --  which will be at least a decade hence , I pray  --  Mamma will marry me off to some pale , flaxen-haired English miss with a slew of titles hanging off her papa 's name and fifty thousand pounds in the three-percents , and I shall have little say in the matter . " Viviana 's eyes narrowed . " Oh ! So I am too old and too foreign and too bourgeois for the grand Hewitt dynasty ? Is that it ? " " Now , Vivie , " he chided , sitting up fully . " I never said that . " " I think you hardly need to ! " Viviana curled one fist into the bedsheet , grappling with the nausea again . Why in God 's name had she raised such a topic ? He was right . She had known all along this would not last . But she had asked , and there was no backing away from it now . " In a few weeks , Quin , you will be one-and-twenty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , whom you choose to marry will be up to you . Do not dare pretend otherwise . You insult my intelligence . " " Aww , Vivie ! " He screwed up his face like the impatient young man he was . " We have our whole lives before us ! I am not marrying anyone anytime soon . Why spoil what we have now ? " She gave him a mordant smile . " Si , it is a tedious business , this future , is it not ? " Quin did not catch the sarcasm . " That 's my girl , " he said , kissing her again . " Look , Vivie , I brought you something . Something which will cheer you up . " He climbed from the bed and rummaged through his coat pockets , returning with a small box . " Open it , " he commanded . Viviana lifted the lid and gasped . The box held a ring ; a wide , ornately carved band set with one large , square-cut ruby . It was a truly magnificent piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did he insist on showering her with gifts ? What she wanted was something his money could not buy  --  and this ring had undoubtedly cost Quin far more dearly than even he could afford . Quin pushed the box back at her . " Put it on , Vivie , " he insisted . " Put it on , but just promise me one thing . " Reluctantly , Viviana slid the ring onto her right hand . " I ... yes , I shall try . " " Promise me you will keep this one , " he said . " Promise me you will never sell it , and that you will wear it once in a while , and think of me . " Viviana was still staring at the ring , and blinking back tears of grief and rage and love and about a hundred other conflicting emotions . " I never stop thinking of you , Quin , " she whispered . " As I never stop thinking of you , Vivie . " But there was mild skepticism in his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Six , " she said hollowly . " Yes , and I must go soon , " he went on . " We are wasting precious time when we could be enjoying one another . I could be telling you , Viviana , that you are the most beautiful creature on this earth . That your eyes make my breath seize , and that your breasts nearly make my heart stop . Lie down , my dear , and let me make love to you again . " So it was lovemaking now . Not his earlier , more vulgar phrase . She should have refused him . She should have told him to leave her bed that very moment . But the memory of a sweeter , happier time had drawn painfully near , and the future stretched out bleakly before her . So Viviana turned onto her back and let him join his strong , vigorous body to hers one last time . Quin rose from her bed some hours later , his mood improved , but his gaze still wary . She watched him dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering , not for the first time , what he would look like in the full splendor of manhood . Already , his shoulders were wide , and his face shadowed with a stubble which matched his heavy , dark hair . He dragged his shirt on over his head , and she marveled again at the perfection which was his face . That patrician forehead , the thin blade of a nose , lean , high-boned cheeks , and the most stunning feature of all , eyes the color of the Aegean at dusk . Oh , it was no wonder he had caught her eye . But how had she been such a fool as to let him steal her heart ? She tried to watch dispassionately as he drew on his stockings and hitched up his trousers . It was not anger she felt toward him , no . It was more of a resigned acceptance . Nor did she blame him . It was her own passionate , romantic nature which had got her into this . Ah , but one could not sing without passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the fact that , on this earth , one took the bad with the good , and lived a full life in return . He pulled on his coat , then leaned across the bed , setting both hands on the mattress . He held her gaze for a time , his eyes so intense , she felt , fleetingly , as though he could look into her soul . " Tell me something , my dear , " he said quietly . " Do you love me ? " It surprised her a little , for it was a question he had never asked . And she knew what was in her heart , just as surely as she knew what her answer must be . She had at least a little pride left . " No , Quin , " she answered . " I do not love you . And you do not love me . " He looked at her with the eyes of an old man . " No . I suppose I do not . " She shrugged . " It is best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Viviana , " he said . " At least you are honest . " But she was not honest . She had just told him a blatant lie . And as she watched him stride toward the door , she wondered , fleetingly , if perhaps he just done the same . No . No , it was not possible . The door slammed behind him . Viviana exhaled the breath which she had been holding , then closed her eyes , willing herself not to cry . She listened to the heavy tread of his footsteps as he left her . One warm tear rolled awkwardly down her nose , then landed on her pillow with a soft plop ! Abruptly , she sat up in bed . No , by God , she would not cry . Not for him . Not for anyone . Not even for herself . One tear was too many  --  and if another followed , there might well be no end to it . Lucy came back into the room just as Viviana was drawing on her dressing gown . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Grazie . " Viviana went to the small writing desk beneath the window . " Tonight is my last performance as Konstanze , Lucy , " she said , unlocking the little drawer which held her meager savings . " I know , miss , " said the maid as she began to neaten the bed . " It 's been a grand run , has n't it ? What will you do next , I wonder ? Pr'haps you ought to go down to Brighton for a rest . Perhaps Mr. Hewitt would take you ? ' T is beautiful there , I 've heard . " Viviana was already relocking the drawer . " Actually , Lucy , I 'm to go home tomorrow , " she said , handing a pitifully small roll of banknotes to the maid . " Here . I wish you to have this . Lord Chesley need know nothing of it . " The girl looked at her incredulously and pushed Viviana 's hand away . " Why , I ca n't take your money , miss ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got it to spare  --  which heaven knows it 's not my place to say , but there . I 've said it . " " Lucy ! " she chided . " What ? " said the girl . " Do you think I do n't know , miss , that you 've been sending every spare penny home  --  and selling your jewelry and eating day-old bread , too ? Besides that , Lord Chesley pays me well enough to look after you , which I 've been glad to do . " With a wistful smile , Viviana put the money in the maid 's hand and forcibly curled her fingers around it . " Take it , " she insisted . " Where I am to go , neither Pap nor I shall need it . And I wish you to go back to Lord Chesley 's estate and marry that handsome footman of yours . This money is my wedding gift . You must buy a cradle , a very beautiful cradle , for your firstborn , and think of me when you use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the banknotes . " But how can you just up and leave England , miss ? " she asked . " What 's to become of you , so far away , and in such a foreign place ? " Inwardly , Viviana 's smile deepened . The poor girl was so naively provincial  --  just like Quin . " It is my home , " she said quietly . " It is time I returned to it . Now , you must wish me happy , Lucy . I have just learnt that I , too , am about to be married . " The girl 's face broke into an impossibly wide smile . " Oh , lawks , miss ! " she cried , throwing up both hands . " I just knew it ! I just knew Mr. Hewitt would do the right thing , soon you told him ! I just knew it would all come aright somehow . " Viviana felt a hot , urgent pressure well behind her eyes , and turned at once back to her desk . " I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to neaten her pens and papers . " I am returning home to marry someone who used to ... well , someone I used to know . " " Oh , no , miss ! " She felt Lucy touch her lightly on the arm . " But ... but what about Mr. Hewitt ? " Viviana regained her composure , and turned around again . Opera required one to be not just a good singer , but a competent actress as well . " Oh , I think we have come to an understanding , he and I , " she said , forcing a smile . " Well , I ca n't see what it could be ! " said the girl . " Hush , Lucy . " Viviana set her hands on the maid 's shoulders , and swiftly kissed both her cheeks . " I am leaving England , my faithful friend . Do not grieve for me . All good things must come to an end , si ? " Continues ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
