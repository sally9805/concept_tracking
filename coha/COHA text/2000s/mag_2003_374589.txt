With more than 30,000 travel guidebooks on the market , it can be hard to keep up  --  especially when new entries keep coming and old ones keep changing . Budget-travel stalwart The Rough Guide has left a bit of its backpacking image behind with a stylish revamp and now includes some upscale activities , such as wine tasting . Its budget-travel competitor , the Lonely Planet series , currently features downloadable upgrades on its website that contain changes since the last edition was published . And for the more upscale traveler , two new guidebook series are creating a buzz : <P>  --  The exclusive Nota Bene series ( NB Publishing ) is the splashiest  --  and snootiest  --  entry in the guidebook field . Available by subscription at a cost of $300 for 10 issues , the skinny , sorbet-colored " destination reviews " are devoted to seeking out the hippest hotels , the trendiest bars and the hottest restaurants in places from Courchevel to Marrakech . Reviewers tell you not only what to order on the menu but also the right table to sit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to , " promise the authors in the Paris issue . " Read NB assiduously and your travel itinerary will consist of jewel after jewel . " But not everything is a jewel : the Hotel Meurice , they decree , is a " shrine to bad taste ... We loathe it . " <P>  --  A more egalitarian but still trendy guide is the sleek new Moon Metro series ( Avalon Publishing ) , which explores cities  --  so far , New York , Paris , Washington , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Chicago , London and Amsterdam  --  by neighborhood , with highly individualized but not snarky descriptions written by local correspondents . The guides send travelers to traditional tourist spots as well as chic shops and clubs . The chapters include detailed foldout maps that are discreet enough that you can open them on the street without looking lost .
