The Great Story of Our Era : Average People Better Off // Though the airfield does not appear on many charts , its existence is whispered of among pilots . The approach requires skill and timing , and there have been accidents ; but when the mission is important , some risks must be accepted . Fliers who have data-pulse receivers of the extraordinarily accurate Global Positioning System satellite network use these devices when inbound , as the runway is only 2,350 feet long  --  short by the standards of such things  --  which places a premium on putting the wheels down precisely at the beginning of the field so as not to run out of runway at the end . Pilots exhale with relief when the landing is complete . Once on the ground , planes are directed to taxi to a secluded ramp , where crew and passengers quickly debark to swing into action  --  because there might be a wait for tables . // The aircraft are not military transports full of commandos but small private planes full of diners landing at McGehee ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing number of " fly-in " restaurants in the United States . The runway belongs to McGehee ? s and serves it exclusively . The field is lit for night landings , since the kitchen is open late . Guidance beacons with the aviator ? s designation Loran T40 can be used to find McGehee ? s , this being the international locator signal not of an airport or classified facility but a restaurant . At McGehee ? s , you walk from your airplane to the hostess station . Much of the dinner trade arrives from Dallas , about forty air minutes away , though diners fly in from as far as hundreds of miles distant to savor a menu highlighted by fresh farm-raised catfish , pickled tomatoes , and turtle cheesecake . // Nearly a thousand fly-in restaurants are open for business in America today , according to an organization called Hundred-Dollar Hamburger . ( Small private planes cost around $100 an hour to operate . ) Most are simply eateries adjacent to general-aviation airports , but an increasing number , like McGehee ? s , have become fly-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exciting to the owners of small planes , many of whom learned to fly as a challenge , or in response to the romance of the air , then discovered that they crave destinations for the kind of one-hour hops that make for recreational aviation . Just imagine trying to explain to the indigent of the developing world that one problem experienced by Americans is finding something to do with their personal aircraft ! // So far , fly-in restaurants offer no fly-through windows for takeout ; that may only be a matter of time . Regardless of whether the fly-in restaurant is a breakthrough or an absurdity , what is telling is that the aircraft landing at McGehee ? s are not private jets of the super-rich . Rather , they are one- and two- engine propeller planes of farmers , oil-field workers , mid-career professionals , and others from the middle class : men and women who are scarcely oligarchs , but who can afford to own an airplane and to drop $100 on a whim for a platter of fresh catfish . Today in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are not rich , just as millions of not-rich Americans own two homes or four cars plus a boat , or know other extravagances once reserved for the topmost fraction of the elite . // Fly-in communities have sprung up as well  --  entire housing developments built around runways for small planes . Spruce Creek , near Daytona Beach , Florida , is a fly-in subdivision which boasts about 1,200 homes and fourteen miles of aircraft taxiway connecting houses with the runway . Pecan Plantation , completed at the turn of the twenty-first century near Fort Worth , Texas , has 125 homes , all served by taxiways . Planes can land , taxi home to the owner ? s house , and be parked in the drive . Teen pilots can bring airplanes to the front door to pick up their dates . The occupants of Pecan Plantation are well-off but not millionaires . Many houses in the subdivision have hangars rather than garages , a popular option being 4,500-square-foot hangars  --  sized for two cars and two airplanes. // If fly-in dining and runway-based homes aren ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Today in the United States there are at least two hundred housing developments built around fairways . At these communities , one sees golf carts scooting along side streets : Many residents own their own carts , park them in the garage , and ride directly from the back porch door to the clubhouse . Golf-course living , with club membership typically included in the home purchase price , has grown so much in popularity that developments are now found not just near big-money cities but in states such as Missouri and Wyoming . Powder Horn , a golf community in Sheridan , Wyoming , looks out on the majestic Bighorn Mountains and offers a well-reviewed eighteen-hole course reached from the porch door via personal cart . The development ? s realty brochure gives this advice regarding lots : " Select a site on the fairway , one with a river or lake view , nestled in the hillside , close to the clubhouse or walking distance to the practice range . " Beautiful , well-appointed homes at Powder Horn cost from about $285,000 to about $425,000  --  not cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of Americans . // Prefer the lake to ducking aircraft or dodging golf carts ? In 2000 , fully 13 percent of American home purchases were of second homes , mostly in vacation areas of woodland , mountain , or shore . Second-home sales have boomed so much that in many popular rustic retreats  --  such as the San Juan Islands north of Seattle , Washington , or Deep Creek Lake , Maryland , in the Alleghenies , equidistant from Pittsburgh and Washington , D.C.  --  vacation homes by the thousands line the desirable riparian acreage , with land parcels growing scarce . // A century ago the very notion of a second home , owned not as a principal dwelling but a place of relaxation , could be contemplated strictly by a minuscule super-elite ; now there are millions with a weekend place , and the number keeps rising . Today a leading problem with your dream house by the water is that so many other people also own vacation homes and own powerboats or jet skis  --  in 2001 , Americans spent $25 billion , more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tranquility may be shattered by piston roar . At present many lakeside communities are wrapped up in campaigns to restrict noise from private motor vessels , and the politics of the mat- ter are delicate , because often the factions favoring stillness are arrayed in opposition to boat owners and jet skiers who are working-class women and men , and who feel their privileges are being trampled . // But imagine ; the boat owners are working-class . Merely the concept of the " pleasure " boat possessed by an average individual rather than by a duke or an industrialist is new to our moment . Now so many average people own pleasure boats that docking space is short in many areas , while marinas have become the " marina industry "  --  complete with its own lobby group , the International Marina Institute , and with several trade publications , among them Marina Dock Age and Marina and Boatyard Today . In other battles regarding the great outdoors , such as in the national-monument areas of the California desert or at Yellowstone National Park , the offending machines may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , owned by average people and opposed by those who dislike the noise . Since 1995 , Americans have purchased more than 3 million all-terrain vehicles , which are used almost exclusively for recreation , and continue to snap them up at a rate of about 750,000 per year . But imagine  --  average people own expensive specialized vehicles just for weekend recreation . And so many of these vehicles exist that they have become a political issue ! // Fly-in restaurants , golf-course communities , rustic lakes ringed by second homes , pleasure boats , huge SUVs with heated leather seats and built-in video , custom-painted snowmobiles with GPS : These and many other big-ticket items are now marketed not to the top but to the middle of American society , and increasingly to the middle of European society , too . They serve as well as any examples might to illustrate one of the most fundamental trends in the postwar Western world : namely , the grand increase in living standards for people who aren ? t rich . // Poverty persists in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a national outrage ; millions live from paycheck to paycheck under nerve-racking financial pressure ; millions lack health insurance ; runaway materialism simultaneously makes us shallow and fails to give satisfaction ; mass culture ( the movies , television , pop music ) grows stupider by the minute ; inequality means some have far more than they could ever need while others have only resentment ; global forces cause many to fear job loss . All these are important objections to trends in contemporary American life . // But in the main , Americans are steadily better off , and while the rich are richer , the bulk of the gains in living standards  --  the gains that really matter  --  have occurred below the plateau of wealth . Almost every person in the United States and the European Union today lives better than did his or her parents . In the United States and Western Europe , almost everything is getting better for almost everybody : This has been the case for years , and is likely to remain the case . // Consider a few statistics , derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of households in the United States today have an income of at least $75,000 , which equates to some sixty-three million people existing at the material standard of the upper middle class . Sixty-three million people  --  more than the total population of the United States in the year 1890  --  now live an " upper " existence in material terms . An upper-or-above life situation hardly ensures happiness , as large numbers of materially favored people today nevertheless feel miserable , a topic this book will explore in some depth . But the notion of sixty-three million people being very well off represents an astonishingly positive trend in standards of living . In 1890 , less than 1 percent of American households earned the equivalent of $75,000 in today ? s dollars ; now nearly a quarter of households are at that favored point . //
