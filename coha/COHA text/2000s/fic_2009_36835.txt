<br> O Castle Gloom ! thy dark defile Throngs not with Scottish story ; On other towers , O proud Argyle Sits crowned thine ancient glory . But little have we of the past , As up the dell we ramble , To figure , floating on the blast , Thy banners , Castle Campbell ! " Castle Campbell , " by William Gibson Near Castle Campbell , Clackmannanshire , June 1608 <br> Elizabeth Campbell lowered the creased piece of parchment into her lap and looked out the small window , watching the hulking shadow of Castle Campbell fade into the distance with a heavy heart . No matter how many times she read the letter , it did not change the words . Her time , it seemed , was up . <br> The carriage bounced along the uneven road , moving at a painstakingly slow pace . Recent rain had made the already rough road to the Highlands treacherous , but if they continued like this , it would take a week to reach Dunoon Castle . <br> Lizzie glanced across the carriage and caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other woman quickly shifted her eyes back to her embroidery , feigning a concentration belied by the ill-formed stitches . <br> Alys was worried about her , though trying not to show it . Hoping to divert her questions , Lizzie said , " I do n't know how you can sew with all this bumping  --  " <br> But her words were cut off when , as if to make her point , her bottom rose off the seat for a long beat and then came down with a hard slam that rattled her teeth , as her shoulder careened into the wood-paneled wall of the carriage . <br> " Ouch , " she moaned , rubbing her arm once she was able to right herself . She glanced at Alys , who 'd suffered a similar fate . " Are you all right ? " <br> " Aye , my lady , " Alys replied , adjusting herself back on the velvet cushion . " Well enough . But if the roads do not improve , we 'll be a heap of broken bones and bruises before we arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get much worse . Taking the carriage at all was probably a mistake . " They would have to switch to horses when they passed Stirlingshire , crossed into the Highland divide , and the roads narrowed  --  or , she should say , became more narrow , as they were barely wide enough for a carriage even in this part of the Lowlands . <br> " At least we 're dry , " Alys pointed out , always one to see the positive side of a situation . Perhaps that was why Lizzie enjoyed her company so much . They were much alike in that regard . Alys reached down and picked up the letter that had fallen to the ground with the tumult . " You dropped your missive . " <br> Resisting the urge to snatch it back , Lizzie took it casually and tucked it safely in her skirts . " Thank you . " She could sense Alys 's curiosity about the earl 's letter , about what was taking them to Dunoon Castle so suddenly , but she was n't ready to alleviate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents soon enough . It would be no secret that her cousin the Earl of Argyll intended to find Lizzie a husband . <br> Again . <br> Apparently , three broken engagements were n't enough . It was her duty to marry , and marry she must . <br> Her chest squeezed as the humiliating memory of her most recent broken betrothal returned to her in an unwelcome flash . The pain , even with the passage of two years , was still acute . " Elizabeth Monntach , " they 'd called her . And she so eager for compliments that she 'd " lapped them right up like a grateful pup . " <br> The humiliation still burned . Worse , John was right . She 'd been far too eager , far too ready to believe that a handsome man like him could care for her for reasons beyond clan alliances and wealth . Her best friend had found happiness ; she 'd desperately wanted it , too . Enough to ignore what her gut was telling her  --  that beneath the handsome exterior was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man she 'd given her heart to speak so cruelly of her would have been bad enough , but then it got worse . Much worse . She closed her eyes but could not shut out the memories of stammering . Of slipping in the mud . Of their mockery . " Her feet are as tangled as her tongue . " The sounds of their laughter still echoed in her head . She could almost taste the hot , salty tears that had burned in her throat and eyes . She 'd wanted to crawl under her bed and never come out . <br> Only one man had helped her . She 'd been too embarrassed to look at him , but she remembered the kindness  --  not pity  --  in his voice and the comforting strength of his callused hand . She frowned . Strange to think that her gallant knight had been a MacGregor . <br> She 'd missed the chaos that had followed her departure from the pavilion , but later her brother had told her what had happened . Alasdair Roy MacGregor and his men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been none too happy about it . What Jamie could n't understand was why the outlaw had risked discovery to come to her assistance in the first place . She did n't know , either , but she would be forever grateful for his act of kindness . <br> She sensed that Jamie knew more about the man who 'd helped her than he 'd let on , but perhaps because he could sense her interest , he 'd held his tongue , refusing to satisfy her curiosity about the gallant outlaw . <br> She 'd put an end to the betrothal with John Montgomery immediately , too ashamed to tell her family the particulars . But when he 'd been maimed in an attack not long afterward , losing an ear and part of his sword arm , Lizzie wondered if her family had discovered something on their own . She had not wished him ill but knew that nothing she could have said would have stopped her family from exacting retribution . They were much too protective of her . Perhaps that was part of the problem  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the unpleasantness behind her and tried to forget , but sometimes , like now , it would come back to her in a vivid wave as if it had been yesterday . And when word spread that once again the Earl of Argyll was seeking an alliance for his oft-betrothed cousin , the whispering would start all over again . <br> She dreaded the conversation with her cousin , knowing that she would no longer be able to keep secret the extent of her foolishness with John . <br> Though her cousin Archie had n't come out and said marriage was his intent , Lizzie had read between the lines of his letter . She lifted the parchment to the window once again , the bold black scratches of ink revealing far more than what was written . <br> My dear cousin , <br> Summer is fast upon us . I request the pleasure of your company at Dunoon as soon as possible to discuss a matter of some import . As we discussed last winter , for your kindness following the death of the countess last year and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifted you with a sizeable parcel of land . <br> Archibald , 7th Earl of Argyll <br> More land . How humiliating . Despite her cousin 's claim , Lizzie knew that her help following the death of the countess was n't the real reason for the gift . Archie obviously thought he needed to sweeten the pot to get someone to marry her . No doubt he was only trying to help , but her tocher was already one of the richest in the land ; was n't that enough ? <br> Her shoulders sagged . Apparently not . <br> Part of this was her own fault . Summer , she 'd promised . Could it be June already ? When her cousin had broached the subject of another betrothal all those months ago during the Yule celebration , the days were still short and the snow blanketing the moors of Inveraray Castle still comfortably deep . Summer had seemed so far away . There had seemed plenty of time to find a suitable man on her own . Plenty of time in which to fall in love . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed to marry only for love  --  what she thought she 'd found with John . But it had been a foolish girl 's vow . A vow made when her emotions were still raw and tender from his cruelty . <br> Now , two years later , Lizzie had to be practical . At six and twenty , love probably was n't for her . <br> Probably . <br> She sighed at her own foolishness . Even with reality staring her in the face , she could not completely shed the possibility from her mind . But it was well past time to give up that particular fantasy . She did n't want to live her life alone . Taking care of her cousin 's and brother 's households would not be enough forever , and as much as she loved little Archie and the girls , the children were not hers . She wanted a home and family of her own  --  enough to accept a new betrothal brokered by her cousin . <br> She felt a twinge of regret , thinking of her friends ' happiness , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meg Mackinnon and Flora MacLeod , had both been fortunate enough to find love with their husbands . Ironically , Meg had married Flora 's brother Alex . Meg had two young sons , and Flora had recently given birth to twins . Lizzie was happy for them , but it made her deeply aware of all that she was missing . <br> But as much as she wanted what her friends had found , she had to accept that she could not wait any longer for something that might never happen . <br> It does n't matter , she told herself , determined as always to make the best of every situation . I will make my own happiness . Arranged marriage or not . <br> " Is something wrong , mistress ? " <br> Lost in thought , Lizzie had n't realized that Alys had been watching her again . She lifted a brow . " I thought you were embroidering ? " <br> This time Alys would not be put off . Curiosity , it seemed , had finally overridden discretion . " You keep staring at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> A wry smile curved Lizzie 's mouth . " Nothing as dramatic as that , I 'm afraid . " The earl would be angry , but not with her . <br> " Are you worried about the travel with all those horrid MacGregors scurrying about the countryside ? " Alys leaned across and patted her knee . " There 's nothing to worry about . My Donnan will see that we come to no harm . " <br> Alys 's husband was captain of the earl 's guardsmen at Castle Campbell , and she was fiercely proud of the formidable warrior . <br> " No , it 's not the travel , " Lizzie assured her . They were well protected by a dozen guardsmen , and not even the outlawed MacGregors would dare attack the Earl of Argyll 's carriage . Besides , they were still in the Lowlands , well away from the Lomond Hills , where the proscribed clan was reputed to have fled following the battle of Glenfruin . <br> Even as news of the atrocities committed by the MacGregors at Glenfruin spread through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who 'd come to her aid with the band of ruthless outlaws who 'd perpetrated a massacre on the field of Glenfruin . In this , however , she was alone in her family . Her cousin had been charged by King James to bring the MacGregors to justice for their crimes and for the past few years had made it his mission . A mission in which her brothers Jamie and Colin had joined . It was only a matter of time before the outlaws were all hunted down . <br> Continues ...
