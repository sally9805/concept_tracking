Our report on the debate over what to do about America 's 11 million illegal immigrants sparked comment from readers who argued against punishing people for seeking a better life . But others rejected offering citizenship to those who have broken the law or are unwilling to assimilate <P> " Should They Stay Or Should They Go ? " April 10 was a thought-provoking contribution to the divisive debate on illegal immigration . The 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. broke our laws , and that has to be remedied . But surely the majority of them are otherwise law-abiding , hardworking individuals , many with children who are American citizens . For the sake of millions of American citizens who are no less patriotic than the rest of us , let 's not criminalize their parents just because they are here illegally . We should make illegals pay a fine and , if they have no criminal record , allow them to apply for a guest-worker visa and demonstrate that they can speak English . If they fulfill those requirements , they should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> U.S. companies pay illegals poverty wages , reap high profits and complain that if they had to employ legal workers they would go out of business . That is modern slavery , no matter how you cut it , and the only way to stop it is to close the borders , fine those who hire illegal immigrants and then ferret out the illegals who are in this country . <P> WILLIAM KITTLE Birmingham , Ala . <P> Giving amnesty to illegal aliens would be similar to catching a man driving a stolen car and then allowing him to keep the car and providing him with a lifetime supply of gas .

The influx of undocumented workers helps and burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans on both sides of the fence seldom seek compromise or consider the big picture . U.S. citizens who benefit from reduced prices at the supermarket also see their tax dollars strained to support overburdened hospitals , schools and social programs . The only reasonable solution is to pass a law that incorporates compassion with responsibility . It is too late to begin criminalizing people who risked their lives accepting an invitation from U.S. businesses to break the law . <P> WAYNE TRUJILLO Denver <P> I am one of thousands of Indians who came to this country legally . I waited for a green card for five years , filed multiple forms , paid taxes and abided by all the rules and laws . Millions of my countrymen are still awaiting a green card ( let alone citizenship ) after many years because they have followed the law . How fair is it to grant citizenship to people who entered illegally while legal immigrants have to wait to become Americans ? It seems that it is advantageous to break the law in the U.S. The only solution is to let illegals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> SHANKAR KRISHNA Pacheco , Calif.
