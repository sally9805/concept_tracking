Chapter One Not again , " MADISON REED groaned as she glared at the mocking red numbers of the clock radio on her nightstand . It was 4:33 A.M. Unlike the five previous mornings , she made no attempt to go back to sleep . She knew it would be useless . Instead she stared out the French doors in her bedroom and watched darkness slowly give way to hues of orange and yellow ushering in the coming day . She did n't have to be a medical doctor or a psychologist to know the reason behind her sleeplessness at night or her headaches during the day . However , knowing the reason and correcting the situation were two entirely different matters . She 'd helped so many others find their way , but she just did n't seem to be able to do the same with her own life . Two doors down the hall was her office . On the walls , on her desk , and in the open bookcase were numerous awards , plaques , and accolades attesting to the success of her professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television show in its time period for the past six months , and market shares were increasing with each rating period . Her dimpled smile was seen by hundreds of thousands in the North Texas region each weekday from four to five P.M. on WFTA Channel 7 in Dallas . The second child of Gladys and Billy Evans had always liked to talk and had put the talent to good use . The alarm clock shrilled . She punched the off button , threw back the down comforter and left the bed , pushing her problems firmly to the back of her mind as she did so . Her adoring public and her co-workers could never know that Madison Reed was living a lie . Crossing the thick oyster-colored carpet , she entered the bathroom . Stripping off her silk pajamas , Madison passed in front of the six-foot-long mirror over the white marble vanity . Not given to conceit , she spared only a cursory glance at her reflection , but it was enough to show there was nothing sagging or protruding where it should n't have been . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother said , trying to spare the feelings of her youngest child who had n't matured as her older sister had . Madison had been fifteen before she needed a bra . However , by eighteen her body had come into its own . She had curves instead of angles , and after waiting more than half her life for them , she was n't in a hurry to see them disappear . Her passion for danishes and chocolates did n't show . Yet . With a sigh she stepped into the shower and made a halfhearted promise that she 'd start exercising before she had to ask Ray , the head cameraman , to put a filter on the lens . Politely she ignored the little voice that said she 'd been telling herself that for the past six months . But it was difficult to find the energy when her mind was on other matters . Adjusting the water , she reached for the floral-scented bath gel . Rubbing her body briskly with a sponge , she realized that , having passed her thirtieth birthday a month before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds as easily as before . She only had to look at her mother and her sister , Dianne . Surprisingly it was her mother who , rain or shine , faithfully walked five miles each morning in the neighborhood or in the nearby shopping mall . On the other hand , Dianne , who had never lacked self-confidence , did n't seem to mind the fifteen pounds she 'd added since the birth of her two children . She was always quick to say , if David did n't want her , she could easily find another man who did . On cue , David would always say that after the man got out of the hospital Dianne might not want him . Then , they 'd look dopey at each other and grin . Their interchange was the standing joke of the family . They all knew Dianne and David had a good strong marriage . For a moment Madison 's eyes closed with regret before she hurried to finish . She had no time for reflection . They were taping the last show of the season today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked around , the sponge falling from her hand . Through the frosted glass she saw the image of a man . " Madison . " The knock came again . Brisker this time and more demanding . " Can I speak with you ? " For a moment longer she hesitated , then cut off the water . Stepping to one side , she slowly cracked the shower door open and stuck her head out . Wes , handsome enough to cause any woman 's breathing to stall , stood a few feet away . As always he was impeccably dressed . Today in a dark blue five-thousand-dollar Brioni suit . She had known him almost seven years and had never seen him look less than his best or engage in anything more rigorous than a game of golf . " I did n't know you were back , " she said , then thought how peculiar those words were . Wes flashed her a smile seen by tens of thousands . If he had his way the number would soon be in the tens of millions . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disturb you . " Madison nodded , silently acknowledging his reasons and thinking how far they had drifted apart , how effortlessly Wes exuded his boyish charm when he needed something from her . " I just wanted to make sure that you 're still coming with me tonight to the awards ceremony . " Her hand tightened on the door . Duty called . " I told you I 'd be there . " He opened his mouth as if to say something , then closed it . Soft , manicured hands slipped into the pockets of his tailored slacks . In anyone else Madison might have thought the gesture indicated uneasiness or uncertainty , but Wes had never been either . " A car is picking us up at seven sharp , " he told her . That was expected . Wes always insisted on a limousine for their public appearances . " I 'll be ready . " His gaze narrowed . He crossed the white tile floor until he stood within a foot of her . " This is important to me . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair out of her eyes with a hand that was n't quite steady and wished he had waited until she had gotten out of the shower . His attention drifted to her lips , moist and trembling . He made a motion as if to step closer , then checked it when she jerked her head back . His mouth thinned . Whirling , he walked away . Madison closed the door , picked up the sponge , then turned the water back on . There had once been a time when just his nearness would have caused her heart to pound , her body to want . A time when , if he had found her in the shower he would have come inside and come into her . Their cries of passion would have filled the room instead of their stilted , awkward conversation . Once they 'd had so much and had been so sure of themselves , so sure their love would last a lifetime . Once . No more . They were husband and wife , but they only spoke to each other when and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of a loving marriage the cause of her sleeplessness and headaches was all too clear . Although she worked as a lowly gofer at a TV station in Chicago where Wes was a newly hired roving reporter , the first time they saw each other was at her second job as hostess of an upscale steakhouse . She 'd taken the position to help pay off her college loan and help with expenses . Wes had come in with a date , but had called back after leaving and asked to speak with her . She 'd thought that tactless and told him so . A couple of weeks later they 'd run into each other at the station . Wes had redoubled his efforts to get her to have dinner with him . A month later , finally convinced that he and the woman were n't in a relationship , she 'd gone out with him . The manager at the steakhouse said he wished Madison had held out longer . Wes , coming in almost every night , was good for business . He always ordered the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wes had come from money , but he had never been condescending to any of the people working at the restaurant or the station . He was carefree , fun to be with , and attentive . It had been easy to fall in love with him . His parents had n't felt the same way about Madison . The first time A.J. and Vanessa Reed had met Madison she 'd been working at the restaurant . They 'd come from Texas to pay an unexpected visit to Wes , their only child , and he had brought them to see her . His parents ' cool reception had n't bothered Madison . She was n't naive enough to believe that there was n't a class and a color system among African-Americans . Although A.J. Reed was a shade darker than Madison 's honeyed-brown complexion , Vanessa Reed was high yellow and so was the obviously wealthy young woman they had with them . It had n't taken long to realize that she , not Madison , was what the Reeds wanted for their son . Madison had been taught by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . They might not own their own home or have a college education , but they were honest , hardworking people who loved their children and did without so their kids could have more than they 'd had . For Madison to be ashamed of who she was , was to be ashamed of them . She 'd shown Wes 's dinner party to their seats and come over once at his request , then tried to do the impossible , accept that Wes was lost to her . Later that night she 'd come out of the restaurant to find him waiting with a large bouquet of flowers and a kiss that had made her heart leap and her body ache . " You 're what I want . What I 'm going to have . " " But your par- " He 'd kissed her again and she had ceased to think of anything , but being in his arms . The next day they 'd met his parents for brunch . The other woman was n't there . His parents had been pleasant , if not friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stunning three-carat colorless pear-shaped solitaire engagement ring . Nine months later they 'd had the big social wedding that Wes and his parents insisted on , and she had been the happiest woman on earth . By that time they were both in Texas , Wes 's home state . Wes had been hired at a TV station in Fort Worth , and luckily she 'd secured a position in nearby Dallas at a rival TV station as assistant to the producer of Wake Up Dallas , a morning talk show . They 'd spun dreams and plans for a bright future . Wes as head anchor on CNN , and she as the next Oprah Winfrey . But all that had ended two years ago . Pain and a deep sense of loss hit Madison without warning . Her hand trembled as she cupped her stomach . Tears pricked her eyes . Her baby should have lived , and Wes should have been there for both of them . Knowing she 'd be no good to herself or anyone else if she gave in to the anguish and anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present . Shutting off the water , Madison left the shower , grabbed a towel , and quickly dried her body . She had a show to do and an awards ceremony to get through . Madison wheeled her late-model Mercedes into her assigned parking space a mere thirty minutes before the taping of her show was to begin . Being late irritated the hell out of her . She prided herself on her punctuality . Besides , this was one of the most important shows of the season . But a traffic accident on Central Expressway had virtually shut down the freeway in both directions , and by the time Madison knew what was going on , it had been too late to take an alternate route . Slamming out of her car , she slung her black Yves St. Laurent duffel bag over her shoulder and sprinted toward the front door , glad she could run in three-inch heels . She reached for the code box just as she heard the buzzer for admittance . Opening the glass door , she smiled at the receptionist , Frankie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to hit on Frankie , stood a short distance away . " Good morning , Frankie . Thanks . " " Good morning , Ms. Reed . Good luck today . " " Thanks , Frankie . Please let Sarita know I 'm here and I 'm ready for her to do my makeup , " Madison said on her way past the receptionist . " Ms. Reed ? " Madison paused in her headlong flight . She glanced around to see a man in his mid-forties with four children in varying ages , from a toddler clutching him around his neck to a gangly teenager staring at her with sullen brown eyes . Impatience radiated through Madison , but she had long since mastered the art of hiding her emotions . " Yes , but I 'm in a hurry now , " she told him . The man visibly swallowed . His hold on the child in his arms tightened . " The-the show you 're doing is about breast cancer , is n't it ? " Something like lead settled in Madison 's stomach . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that would impact the lives of women and cut across social , economic , and racial lines . " Yes . " " Tell them ... the women ... to get checked . " He looked at the girls , touched the hair of the oldest . Tears formed in his dark eyes . " Maureen always said she was too busy . We lost her last year , the day after Christmas . She loved me and the girls . I just wish she had loved herself as much . " His voice wavered , then steadied . " After she found out , she would n't have the surgery . She thought it would make a difference . It would n't have , but I could n't get her to understand . Now I have to raise the girls by myself . She 'll never get to do all the things she planned to do with them . A mother should watch her daughters grow up . " A hard lump formed in Madison 's throat that no amount of swallowing could move . How many times had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always cooperate . " Is everything all right , Ms. Reed ? " Thomas asked , stepping beside her . He turned hard , accusing eyes on the man . " He came in with your other guest . His name was n't on the list so I had him sign in and wait here . He said you were expecting him . " Madison came to a quick decision . " You 're perceptive as usual , Thomas . " When Thomas reached for the man Madison shook her head . " However , I 've decided to add him to the show . " She turned to the man . " I think having you and your daughters on the show will speak more eloquently than anything I could say . Are you up for it ? " The man hefted the child in his arms . " None of us have ever been on TV before , but if it will help one family not go through what we 're going through , I guess we can do it . A family is too important not to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd ever have one . The show went well . There had n't been a dry eye on the set or in the audience by the time the taping was over . More importantly , she hoped women would accept the challenge to schedule their mammogram appointment then notify the station . She wanted the switchboard to be inundated with calls . Then , perhaps , another family would n't have to go through Christmas without their mother . On the second floor of the station where the executives offices were located , she knocked on the door marked GORDON ARMSTRONG , PRODUCER in block letters . " Come in . " Continues ...
