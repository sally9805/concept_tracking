It 's been six years since Fight Club , his first novel , made him a cult figure . It 's been one year since Choke made him a best seller . But Chuck Palahniuk is still inconsolable . The sheer , emasculating plenty of bourgeois life , all that stuff you can buy  --  it still sends him into an angry funk . In his new book he is also consumed by a world burdened with radio personalities , invasive kudzu , tormented anchovies and boring , phony jobs . There are writers who have a signature mood . What Palahniuk has is a signature posture : recoil . <P> When you are a writer with that many axes to grind , it 's only a matter of time before you produce a novel about serial killers . Not that the offhand killings in Lullaby ( Doubleday ; 260 pages ) involve anything so blunt as a hatchet . The murder weapons here are words . At fortysomething , Carl Streator has been a widower for 20 years . He is a recognizable Palahniuk character , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of churches , factories and houses , then stomping them to splinters until his feet bleed . Carl is a newspaper reporter working on a series about sudden infant death syndrome . Along the way he discovers a children 's book containing a rhyme that can kill when the possessor reads it to anyone or even thinks it in his or her direction . Having memorized the fatal lines , Carl now holds that power . So , it turns out , does Helen Hoover Boyle , a brassy Realtor whose specialty is selling haunted houses to unsuspecting buyers  --  there 's good money in the high turnover  --  and who long ago began putting the lethal verse to her own uses . <P> The two set out cross-country to destroy every copy of the poem , bringing in tow Helen 's assistant Mona , a hippie-ish " witch , " and Mona 's eco-ranting boyfriend Oyster , the most comically egregious tagalong since that sourpuss hitchhiker picked up by Jack Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces . ( Oyster describes Johnny Appleseed , who spread non-native plant life , as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl struggles with his impulse to wipe out everybody in his path who annoys him . Because his path runs through barroom blowhards and rude librarians , to say nothing of Oyster , that 's a lot of folks . <P> Dark riffing on modernity is the reason people read Palahniuk . His books are not so much novels as jagged fables , cautionary tales about the creeping peril represented by almost everything . It 's a world so attracted to death that , as one character says , reincarnation seems like just a form of procrastination . If Palahniuk wears his spleen on his sleeve , for a lot of Lullaby he wears it well . Too bad that in the final stretch he steers into some demented supernatural gore , and you recall that the publisher is billing this book as Palahniuk 's first attempt at a thriller . Anybody looking for chills in the Stephen King mode is going to wonder when the shivers are supposed to start .
