PRODUCT Known as " serenity ponds " or " calming pools , " these desktop waterfalls are intended to reduce stress <P> HOW IT STARTED First came feng shui . Then aromatherapy . But burned-out consumers wanted more <P> JUDGMENT CALL Cool , if you stick to old-school Asian designs and steer clear of new-age Lava lamps <P> This month , in the holiday-gifts section of the Stein Mart in Charleston , S.C. , a musical fish could be heard singing Christmas carols across the aisle from a miniature fountain retailing at $24.97 . Both gadgets promise to be top sellers this season . But unlike the $19.97 Big Mouth Billy Bass , the desktop waterfall may outlive its novelty status , drawing on ancient themes to soothe a stressed-out age . <P> For thousands of years , feng-shui practitioners have used the sound of running water to dissolve negative energy . Modern psychologists describe the constant gurgling as " white noise " that drowns out distractions . On the basis of such notions , the same companies that ushered in aromatherapy are now cranking out Zen-inspired relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponds . " And consumers are buying into the idea that burbling rock gardens are effective stress relievers . Americans purchased more than a million of them in 1999 , and sales are expected to top 5 million this year . <P> Powered by electric pumps , these aquatic Nirvana kits are being sold in stores as varied as Bed Bath &; Beyond , OfficeMax and the Sports Authority . Helene Jeffer , a middle-aged Board of Education supervisor in New York City , recently bought one at T.J. Maxx . " It 's very soothing , " she says , but confesses to having moved the 24-hour trickler out of her bedroom because it inspired too many trips to the bathroom . <P> What 's fueling the estimated $150 million miniature-fountain business is the buying power of America 's graying population . " Baby boomers will do anything to keep from aging , and stress makes you look and feel old , " says Paulette Abraham , marketing director of industry leader HoMedics , based in Detroit . The company , which also sells foot massagers and therapeutic magnets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs ranging from $20 nightstand models to $250 slate water walls 4 ft. high . The waterworks are n't always a hit with the younger crowd . This summer a 26-year-old bride in Belmar , N.J. , returned all four of the fountains she received at her wedding . She wonders , " Do people really think newlyweds need that much help relaxing ? " <P> To bridge the generation gap , designers are branching out from the traditional Asian look to include , among other things , Day-Glo marbles and colored lights . Some models are decorated with picture frames , others with spinning balls . There 's even a dizzying version of a water-based Lava lamp . Conair , known more for its hair dryers than its home-spa products , is developing a fountain with water flowing over a 3-D photograph of  --  you guessed it  --  flowing water . " It 's reinvent or die , " says Abraham . " That 's the only way to keep a trend like this going . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
