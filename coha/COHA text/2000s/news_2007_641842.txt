<p> It 's official . <p> Reunion mania <p> has reached <p> a fever pitch . <p> With the Police smashing box-office records across the globe and Van Halen making a ruckus while smaller , yet equally influential , bands such as the Stooges , Jesus and Mary Chain , Crowded House and Smashing Pumpkins are getting their belated love , respect and adoration , the news of Genesis ' Turn It On Again world tour came as little surprise to anybody paying attention . <p> Of course Phil Collins , Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford are getting back together to relive the glory and rehash the music . The stage is set . The public is hungry . It 's easy money - both on the touring end , where artists make the most of their cash , and on the repackaging end , where every Genesis album will be digitally remastered and re-released , and their hits will be re-ordered in yet another best-of incarnation , this one a tour edition . <p> It helps , too , that the band actually gets along . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins said in a recent press conference hyping the world tour . " And we 've been great friends since I left the band . We did n't not work together for any other reason than that there were other things to do . " <p> But as with any reunion , there are certain questions that need answering . Who else are they touring with ? What will the stage show look like ? Is Collins really going to play drums ? And many , many others , depending on whether you 're still in love with " Tonight , Tonight , Tonight " or the sight of Collins ' squishy mug makes you queasy . <p> We 'll save you the hassle , time and frustration of spending hours on Google trying to find out such tidbits and factoids . Here 's your one-stop prep guide for Genesis ' comeback concert at the Pepsi Center on Saturday night . <p> Q : Genesis was always known for its big stage shows . Will this reunion concert be any different ? <p> A : Absolutely not . <p> The tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is using the largest concert screen ever . At 213 feet wide and 40 feet tall , you can count on the band to employ killer graphics alongside old footage for maximum impact . <p> " It 's going to look fabulous , " Mike Rutherford said at the press conference . " Genesis lends itself , definitely , to visual interpretation . It has in the past . And what 's very interesting is that the last time we were out , the three of us , on the We Ca n't Dance tour , the screen concept was just starting off . So in a sense it was quite uphill to make the ( expletive ) thing work , whereas now it 's quite user-friendly . " <p> Two celebrated technicians worked with the band in creating the show : lighting designer Patrick Woodroofe and set designer Mark Fisher . <p> " The smoke and mirrors of previous tours has been replaced by a slightly more toned-down stage consisting of a single gigantic PopMart-style screen and a modest series of flashing lights , " read a rollingstone.com review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Will Collins play drums ? <p> A : Oh , yes . But not for long . <p> " The show kicked off with a medley of instrumentals from their 1980 LP ' Duke , ' the roll <p> ingstone.com review read . " Collins was behind the drum kit , where he would be for about a quarter of the nearly three-hour show . " <p> It may not be lengthy , but it has the potential for excitment . <p> " ( Drummer Chester ) <p> Thompson and Collins ' behind-the-kit duets provided some of the evening 's highlights , " read a late-September review in the Philadelphia Inquirer . <p> Q : Is the show any good ? <p> A : The reviews are mixed - much more so than the early Police reviews . <p> " If you were a fan of this particular version of Genesis , the performance in Hartford was worthy of the more than $200 top-end ticket , " read a story in the Springfield , Mass. , paper The Republican about the Hartford , Conn. , show . <p> Other reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they also come off incredibly dated . <p> " If prog rock has come back into favor , Tuesday 's Genesis show served as a reminder of why it fell out in the first place , " the Philadelphia Inqurer review read . " As one shapeless , interminable jam followed another , the evening deliquesced into a soup of guitar wizardry and keyboard whoosh . " <p> Q : Who else is playing with Collins , Banks and Rutherford ? <p> A : Longtime Genesis player Chester Thompson will play drums all night while Daryl Stuermer will fill out the songs on guitar . <p> Q : Of course original Genesis singer Peter Gabriel is n't on this tour . But what are the chances he 'll participate in a future tour ? <p> A : It 's not likely . <p> " I think Peter always felt threatened by going back , and clearly it represented a much longer time period for him , " said Collins in the new book " Genesis : Chapter and Verse . " <p> " He has built an extremely impressive solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to go back with Genesis in any shape or form . I have always done lots of different things . For me , it 's a case of ' Write a musical ? Sure . Get back with Genesis ? Of course . ' . If you think about it , Peter used to spend most of the ' Lamb ' show in a leather jacket without a shirt . Peter does n't look like that anymore . None of us do . . there was the issue of whether he would want to go back into what he probably remembered as being a hornet 's nest of compromise . Which I do n't really think it is . We 've all grown up . We all know when to back off . We did n't before . " <p> Q : What kind of material will they play ? <p> A : The hits , of course . <p> " Obviously , it 's going to mainly be songs from the last couple tours , " Banks said at the press conference . " But we want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also with some of the medleys we 'll introduce a few surprises so it does n't become too predictable - but we do have so many songs to choose from . " <p> Q : And what about new material ? Are the three of them writing for a new album ? <p> A : " ( There 's ) nothing planned for new material , " said Rutherford . " But I think we always just seem to avoid making the big plan . We 'll do the shows and see what happens . The idea of writing together has always been appealing , but getting on the album bandwagon is a whole different road . But we 'll see . " <p> Ricardo Baca : 303-954-1394 or rbaca@denverpost.com
