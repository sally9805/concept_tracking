CoQ10 is the spark plug that ignites the body 's engine by jump starting energy production within all cells . The body then uses that energy to fuel all its vital processes , including muscle contraction and digestion . Therefore , the presence of CoQ10 in the body is essential to the sustaining of lire . Without an adequate supply of CoQ10 , the body can not maintain normal levels of activity nor can it ward off or fight health disorders . A quarter of a century of clinical testing has shown that CoQ10 is effective in increasing energy levels , in treating heart diseases , in enhancing the immune system , in reversing periodontal disease , in providing antioxidant activity and in preventing certain side effects of common drugs . CoQ10 supplements have been consumed by millions of people for nearly 30 years without serious adverse effects . That is because CoQ10 exists naturally in the human body and consequently there are no adverse side effects from restoring this vital nutrient to its normal level . In tests of thousands of people in Japan , Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , no toxicity has ever been shown , no matter how high the intake amount . As we grow older , the level of CoQ10 in our bodies decreases . This can be due to several factors : the inability of the body to produce or synthesize adequate amounts of CoQ10 , an insufficiency of CoQ10 in the diet or the effect of various outside influences such as stress or disease . With the impact of increasing stress and the continuing growth of chronic disease on modern life , the public is becoming more aware of and turning to the imperative of wellness and nutritional supplementation . Research evidences that CoQ10 should be considered a cornerstone of a comprehensive individual nutrition program , whether an individual is young or old , healthy or not so healthy . Because CoQ10 supplies cells with more natural energy , CoQ10 enhances stamina and improves the body 's overall state of health and wellness . It also protects against free radicals , strengthens the immune system and fosters greater resistance to disease . In numerous research programs conducted by Kaneka Corporation of Osaka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CoQ10 has been proven to be a significant value in alleviating the effects of the following : * Heart disease . * High blood pressure . * Cancer . * Aging . * HIV/AIDS. * Muscular dystrophy. * Multiple sclerosis and Parkinsons disease . * Periodontal disease . * Cholesterol statin drugs and CoQ10 . Research shows that the method by which statin drugs work to block cholesterol also has the potential to block the production of CoQ10 . Since people who take statins may already suffer from low levels of CoQ10 , such added depletion is of great concern . The combined use of CoQ10 and statins , however , can prevent the depletion of CoQ10 and thereby help to minimize the risk of statin-induced cardiac dysfunction , liver dysfunction , muscle weakness , cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure . It is recommended people who suffer from risk factors of any of the above diseases or conditions should raise their CoQ10 levels as soon as possible . In response to the dramatic rise in consumption of CoQ10 , Kaneka Corporation of Osaka , Japan has branded its 100 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q10 and has created the new Kaneka Functional Foods Division , which has begun a major initiative to inform consumers of the benefits of CoQ10 both as a dietary supplement and as a topical agent in health care products .
