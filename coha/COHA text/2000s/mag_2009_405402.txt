Nurse Jackie Showtime , June 8 , 10:30 p.m . ET/PT 3 stars NEW SERIES ! DRAMA If the time ever comes that actress Edie Falco seems phony , showy or anything less than a fully realized human being with love and hurt in her eyes , that will probably be the same day Hollywood is destroyed by an alien species from planet Thespia . In her first major role since she ended her supreme run as Carmela on The Sopranos , she 's Jackie Peyton , an emergency-room nurse in New York City . Jackie is compassionate , hard-working to the point of exhaustion , scornfully impatient of doctors and -- because of a back problem -- not above raiding the hospital pharmacy for painkillers . Although she 's married with kids , she also likes to grab some quick on-the-job sex with Eddie ( Paul Schulze ) , the guy who dispenses the pills . The series is n't breaking any new ground , but Falco gives us a Jackie with no fuss or apologies : just direct , bedrock believability . The question is never whether this woman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is whether she 's got her act sufficiently together to treat the next patient . Top Chef Masters Bravo , June 10 , 10 p.m . ET/PT 2 stars NEW SERIES ! REALITY Host Kelly Choi describes this Top Chef spinoff as a " culinary Clash of the Titans , " but the fun is watching great chefs stumble like ordinary kitchen help as they compete in silly challenges . In the premiere Hubert Keller ( of San Francisco 's Fleur de Lys ) is momentarily at a loss when he 's sent to the market for ingredients -- already a top chef , he never does his own shopping . His ingenuity asserts itself , though , when he figures out how to prepare pasta in a dorm room . Mental FOX , Tuesdays , 9 p.m . ET 1 star NEW SERIES ! DRAMA Chris Vance , who looks like a younger , happier Harvey Keitel , plays psychiatrist Jack Gallagher , the new head of the mental-health ward at a hospital in L.A. ( although the show is shot in Bogot , Colombia ) . Gutsy Gallagher is eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . He also has what one underling describes as " a seriously smokin ' body , " which no one is on record saying of Dr. Phil . The show has been compared to House , but it 's a prefab model : functional , ignorable .
