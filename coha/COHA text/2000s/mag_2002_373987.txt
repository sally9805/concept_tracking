PIXEL PERFECT <P> Why is it that snaps taken with a $500 digital camera often are n't as sharp as those from a $20 disposable ? Because unlike the light-sensitive chemicals in ordinary analog film , each sensor on a digital chip saves only one-third of the color data it receives  --  either red , green or blue , but not all three at once . With the new Foveon X3 technology , however , three sensors are stacked on top of one another , so that each pixel absorbs the full color spectrum . Result : a 3.5-megapixel camera using Foveon technology will produce images as clear as today 's 7 MP models .
