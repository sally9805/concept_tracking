No Doubt about it : With a dose of hip-hop , Gwen Stefani and her posse reanimate their music on Rock Steady . by David Browne Photograph IN THE NO Doubt 's Dumont , Stefani , Kanal , and Young give the fans what they want // No Doubt ROCK STEADY INTERSCOPE A FUNNY THING HAPpened to No Doubt 's Gwen Stefani on her way to irrelevance : She became relevant again . After the snow-cone pop of last year 's Return of Saturn proved to be an artistic and commercial comedown from 1995 's careermaking Tragic Kingdom , No Doubt 's future was suddenly in doubt . The teen girls who once flocked to the 32-yearold Stefani as a groovy role model seemed to ditch her for the fresher-faced likes of Pink and Nelly Furtado . In the meantime , Stefani guested on singles by Eve ( " Let Me Blow Ya Mind " ) and Moby ( " South Side " ) . And irony of ironies , those tossed-off appearancesand not the painstakingly produced Return of Saturn-vaulted her back into the public eye . Stefani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those songs , she was , more than ever , an inflatable blond doll come to life . But the music-Moby 's gossamer electronica and Eve 's hard-bounce hiphop-also placed Stefani 's voice in a new and more arresting context , far removed from her group 's often cloying ska-pop . No Doubt were no dummies . Seeking to capitalize on Stefani 's resurgence and new club cred , they raced into the studio with a slew of producers and knocked out Rock Steady in , what was for them , record time . And in another irony , this beat-heavy quickie turns out to be the best album they 've ever hatched . Picking up where those Eve and Moby rhythms left off , Rock Steady mostly ditches ska , not to mention the overthink of Return of Saturn , and replaces it with doses of the leaner , meaner pop No Doubt was born to make . On Return of Saturn , Stefani presented herself as a star conflicted about her life and career choices , one who wondered if she would ever find the perfect mate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base could n't relate . Rock Steady steers clear of such somber patches and instead finds Stefani returning to her boy-crazy , party-hopping inner teen . It 's a role she was born to play . And the newly revitalized band-bassistkeyboardist Tony Kanal , guitarist Tom Dumont , and drummer Adrian Young-are with her all the way . She 's giddy with lust in " Hella Good , " a hard-pumping strut that comes off like a belated sequel to Madonna 's " Into the Groove , " and she pines away for her out-oftown lover to the glistening William Orbit synth-pop of " Making Out . " The single " Hey Baby " finds a soiree-stuck Stefani sipping tea and coolly observing the mating rituals of her fellow revelers , and its shout-out chorus , which echoes the come-ons of the boys and girls , is big , bustling , and irresistible . One of the most hiphop-infused tracks on the album , it 's a kicky little thing . The band-with the help of producers and veteran beatmakers Nellee Hooper ( Soul II Soul , Bjork ) and Sly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that without a little meat on the bone , Stefani 's Kewpie-doll voice can be awfully grating . So they pump up the volume , the bottom end , and whatever else is at hand . As a result , they fire up some deep dub bass on the reggaerooted " Start the Fire " and the title song , and layers of metallic , Garbage-style brawn on the stream-of-consciousness " Platinum Blonde Life . " The producers keep the frills few and far between , which makes them even more effective when they are employed . The exquisite " Running , " a headover-heels love paean ( inspired , one imagines , by Stefani 's longtime rock steady , Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale ) , sounds as if the band is playing inside a music box . It could be a contender for the coolest wedding song ever . Always suckers for excessive arrangements , No Doubt still manage to mess with a good thing . They collaborate with Prince on " Waiting Room , " a slinky jitterbug about anticipation that 's more alluring than anything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces with former Cars leader Ric Ocasek on " Do n't Let Me Down , " which is an attentive but pointless simulation of that band 's new-wave oingo-boingo . And once more , on a few tracks , they haul out vanilla-flavored ska when they should be extending their experiments in dance and club music . No Doubt will never be classified as one of pop 's landmark bands ; there 's still something oddly flimsy about them . But like rock Martha Stewarts , their partythrowing skills improve with each new gathering . B+ <p>
