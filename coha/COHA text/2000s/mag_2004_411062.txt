A hypothetical population of asteroids inside Mercury 's orbit could provide a treasure trove of information about the solar system 's early history . // BY S. ALAN STERN // " Vulcanoids , is n't that something from Star Trek ? " I ca n't count the number of times I 've been asked that since I became interested in settling a nagging question : Does our solar system contain a population of small bodies revolving around the Sun in tight orbits interior to Mercury ? In reality , however , neither Vulcanoids themselves ( if they exist ) , nor their name , has any lineage from Star Trek . In fact , Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry borrowed the name for Mr. Spock 's red-sky home world from the fabled and all but forgotten phantom planet in our solar system , called Vulcan . Some 19th-century astronomers thought they had spied Vulcan , named after the Roman god of fire and metallurgy , near the Sun during total solar eclipses . But photographic searches early in the 20th century firmly disproved the existence of Vulcan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles across . By contrast , the Vulcanoids - a repeatedly hypothesized population of small asteroids only a few miles in diameter - might really exist . Why should astronomers care if Vulcanoids exist ? For one thing , we want to understand the geography of our solar system . Just as we want to know how many planets orbit the Sun and where they travel , we also want to learn where all the reservoirs of small bodies - comets , moons , meteoroids , and asteroids - lie and how the populations of these reservoirs compare . For another thing , Vulcanoids could be made of the material that composed the innermost portion of the solar nebula , from which the planets formed . So if we find Vulcanoids , their study could offer important clues both to the composition and thermal conditions of the inner nebula and potentially shed light on the material from which Mercury formed . Even beyond these motivations , the detection of a significant population of Vulcanoids could provide insights into the history and chronology of the bombardment of the inner solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable , do astronomers have any basis for thinking Vulcanoids actually might exist ? Several separate lines of reasoning suggest the chances are good . First , planetary astronomers who looked hard enough eventually discovered objects in every place of the solar system where theorists determined stable orbits could exist . The most recent examples of such finds include Kuiper Belt objects ( denizens of the outer solar system that orbit beyond Neptune ) ; the tiny , irregular satellites of Jupiter ; and just last year , the first Trojan asteroid of Neptune ( which follows Neptune 's orbit around the Sun but travels 60 ahead of the planet ) . Theorists have shown that a stable region lies inside Mercury 's orbit . In the late 1990s , astronomers David Vokroulicky , Serge Tabachnik , and Wyn Evans modeled the inner solar system and found that the stable region extends from about 0.08 astronomical unit out to around 0.21 astronomical unit from the Sun . ( One astronomical unit , or AU , is the average distance between the Sun and Earth , about 93 million miles . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone , would have orbits that are neither too close to the Sun , where solar radiation induces a drag that causes objects to spiral into the Sun , nor too close to Mercury , where gravitational interactions each time an object nears the planet prevent stable orbits .

ILLUSTRATION BY DAN DURDA Photograph HEAVILY CRATERED MERCURY suggests that Vulcanoids , even if they do n't exist today , once pummeled the inner planet 's surface . NASA/JPL Photograph SOHO CORONAGRAPHIC IMAGES reveal the motion of Mercury , but they do n't go faint enough to show any possible Vulcanoids . NASA // The mere existence of a stable region for orbits between the Sun and Mercury does n't prove any objects reside there , of course . The second line of evidence that motivates the search for Vulcanoids comes from images of Mercury taken thirty years ago by NASA 's Mariner 10 mission . The images show a surface covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that created those craters must have come from the part of the solar system where Mercury orbits , suggesting that even if no Vulcanoids exist today , there certainly must have been some in the distant past . These facts establish that Vulcanoids used to roam the inner solar system , and that a significant piece of real estate in the same neighborhood could provide stable orbits for them today . A few years ago , my colleague Dan Durda and I set out to see whether any of the ancient Vulcanoids could have survived to the present . We used computer models to calculate the rate of collisions in the Vulcanoid Zone as a function of the number of bodies there and their orbital properties . From those results , the models determined how these collisions would whittle down any given Vulcanoid population . Durda and I found that as many as a few hundred ancient bodies could still reside in the Vulcanoid Zone after 4.5 billion years of solar system history . That 's yet another indication that a search for Vulcanoids could prove fruitful . Devil in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( less than about 0.2 AU away ) and relatively near Earth ( roughly 1 AU away ) , even small ones would be fairly bright . For example , a Vulcanoid 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) in diameter located in the middle of the Vulcanoid Zone would have a visual magnitude of 12.5 , assuming its surface reflects the same percentage of sunlight as Mercury 's . Virtually any amateur astronomer operating a telescope equipped with a CCD camera could detect such an object , were it not for one pesky detail : By virtue of their proximity to the Sun , Vulcanoids can be glimpsed only during twilight , when the Sun lies below the horizon but they do not . Finding Vulcanoids under these conditions is extremely difficult . The inner boundary of the Vulcanoid Zone lies just 0.08 AU from the Sun . Viewed from Earth , this corresponds to a maximum solar elongation angle of just 4 . Even the zone 's outer boundary , at a solar distance of 0.21 AU , yields an elongation of only 12 . This means any search must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short observation window and a battle against the haze and turbulence so common when looking through the twilight sky . If you think spotting Mercury is hard , imagine searching for an object 40,000 times fainter lurking even closer to the horizon . Photograph HEAVILY CRATERED MERCURY suggests that Vulcanoids , even if they do n't exist today , once pummeled the inner planet 's surface . NASA/JPL // Consequently , only a few ground-based searches have been conducted in the past century . Probably the narrowest searches prior to last year were those of Henry Courten and his collaborators in the mid1970s . They searched only during the brief moments of darkness that occur in a total solar eclipse . But during such an eclipse , the sky near the Sun grows much darker than it does at twilight , and observers usually do n't have to peer through as much of Earth 's atmosphere . Unfortunately , given the 1970s-era photographic equipment they had available , and the short duration of an eclipse , Courten 's team could spot only objects brighter than magnitude 8.5 , which corresponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 km ) . So , as clever as this search strategy was , Courten 's team did not find any Vulcanoids . Since Courten 's work , other ground-based observers have looked deeper but were able to search only tiny fractions of the Vulcanoid Zone . As a result , the possibility of a belt of Vulcanoids has never been ruled out . In 1999 , when my colleagues at the Southwest Research Institute and I became interested in hunting for Vulcanoids , we decided to beat the chief problems encountered while observing during twilight or eclipses by going to high altitude . There , the sky is far darker , and haze and atmospheric thickness are not significant factors . Photograph THE SEARCH FOR VULCANOIDS can take place only when those objects lie well above the twilight horizon . That happens when the ecliptic - the plane of the solar system that includes the Vulcanoid Zone - makes a steep angle to the horizon , as it does after sunset in early spring .

NASA PHOTO BY TONY LANDIS A SWUIS-A IMAGE ( above ) of a region near the Sun shows objects down to 11th magnitude . Unfortunately , no Vulcanoids were discovered in more than 200,000 images . DAN DURDA // We began by making a computerized search of several thousand archived images taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) satellite . We examined a sequence of white-light coronagraphic images obtained approximately every 1.6 hours by SOHO 's widest field coronagraph , called LASCO C3 . Each of these images covers approximately 153 square degrees of sky centered on the Sun and extends along the ecliptic out to about 30 solar radii ( 0.14 AU ) in the heart of the Vulcanoid Zone . Unfortunately , the LASCO instrument 's detection limit for moving objects , 8th magnitude , did n't allow us to probe any deeper than the decades-old work of Courten 's team . As a result , we did n't detect any Vulcanoids in the SOHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through LASCO 's field of view . To make a more sensitive search , Durda and I next went back to our roots . We flew our wide-field , image-intensified SWUIS-A camera system for airborne astronomy aboard high-performance NASA aircraft . Previously , we had used SWUIS-A aboard similar jets to record occultations of stars by asteroids and to study Comet Hale-Bopp and Leonid meteors . After NASA approved and funded this project , we conducted a series of twilight missions in 2001 and 2002 , flying 49,000 feet above the Mojave Desert in an F-18 aircraft . At that altitude - the F-18 's service ceiling for cruise flight - twilight is about twenty times darker than on the ground . That greatly improved the Vulcanoid search depth , which in turn allowed us to look for fainter and smaller Vulcanoids . While NASA test pilots kept the aircraft on course , we ( individually in different flights ) used our deep-imaging cameras to survey about 40 percent of the Vulcanoid Zone down to 11th magnitude . This past spring , we completed our analysis of the more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If Vulcanoids larger than about 6 miles ( 10 km ) across exist , they are very rare - no more than a few handfuls can exist . They can run , but can not hide Our F-18-based observations made with the SWUIS-A imaging system resulted in the most comprehensive search yet conducted for Vulcanoids . However , just because there ca n't be more than a small number of 6-mile-wide Vulcanoids does n't settle the issue of whether a Vulcanoid belt exists . To do that , we need to probe down to sizes at least ten times smaller . ( Any objects below this size would be affected far more by radiation drag , causing them to spiral into the Sun relatively quickly . ) Fortunately , the SWUIS-A instrument itself is capable of doing far better , imaging objects almost as faint as 14th magnitude . But to accomplish this , we need a darker twilight than even an F-18 can deliver . Putting SWUIS-A aboard the space shuttle or space station would afford us the kind of dark sky we want . Unfortunately , the shuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they are comparatively poor platforms for surveying the large area of the Vulcanoid Zone . We estimate it would take hundreds of orbits to search the entire region properly . So what 's next ? We will be using high-altitude balloons and suborbital rockets to fly SWUIS-A even higher . If these flights are successful , we either will have discovered Vulcanoids or ruled out anything larger than perhaps 1 kilometer in diameter . The Vulcanoid Zone is the terra incognita of the inner solar system . It has both high scientific value and the allure of discovery that makes astronomy so much fun for us all . We 're still hot on the trail of Vulcanoids - stay tuned . // To learn more about the Vulcanoid search , visit www.astronomy.com/toc Sidebar The Vulcanoid Zone The main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains tens of thousands of rocky objects . A smaller zone of such objects may lurk inside Mercury 's orbit .

Solar radiation would create a drag on small objects located any closer , causing them to spiral into the Sun . ( Solar radiation would evaporate objects closer than 0.06 AU . ) The region beyond 0.21 AU would be swept clean by gravitational perturbations induced by Mercury .
