Chapter One Elizabeth Baxter found the lump on March 7 . She was in the shower , and at first she brushed past it , figured it to be nothing more than a bit of fatty tissue or a knotted muscle or maybe even a figment of her imagination . But then she went over it with her fingertips again and again . And once more , until she knew . No question-it was a lump . And a lump of any kind meant getting an immediate check . This was a road she 'd traveled before . If a breast-cancer survivor knew one thing it was the importance of self-checks . She stopped the water , dried off , and called her doctor while still wrapped in a towel . The mammogram came three days later , and a biopsy was performed the day after that . Now , on a brilliantly sunny morning in mid-March , in the private office of Dr. Marc Steinman , Elizabeth sat stiff and straight next to John as they waited for the doctor to bring the results . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned a few inches to the side and whispered , " He would n't have called us in if it was n't bad . " John did a soft sigh and met her eyes . " You do n't know that . It 's probably nothing . " But his tone lacked the usual confidence , and something wild and fearful flashed in his eyes . He tightened his grip on her hand . " It 's nothing . " Elizabeth stared straight ahead . The wall held an oversized , framed and matted print of a pair of mallard ducks cutting a path across a glassy lake . No , God , please ... not more cancer . Please . She closed her eyes and the ducks disappeared . A parade of recent memories marched across her heart . Ashley and Luke sitting side by side at Luke and Reagan 's wedding reception , reconnected after so many years apart ; Kari and Ryan exchanging vows at a wedding in the Baxter backyard ; little Jessie taking her first steps ; Maddie and Hayley holding hands for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ... they still need me . I still need them . Please , God ... no more cancer . Footsteps sounded in the hall outside , and Elizabeth 's eyes flew open . " Help me , John . " Her voice was pinched , panicked . " It 's okay . " John leaned closer , letting her rest on him . " It 'll be okay . " The doctor entered the room , a file clutched beneath his arm . He stopped , nodded , and sat at the desk opposite them . " Thanks for coming . " He opened the folder and pulled out the top sheet of paper . His eyes met first John 's , then Elizabeth 's . " I have the results of your biopsy . " A pause followed , and John cleared his throat . " She 's fine , right ? " John 's tone sounded forced , unnatural . The doctor opened his mouth , but Elizabeth already knew . She knew the news would be bad , and in that instant she could n't think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . Neither could she think the unthinkable-about regrets or do-overs or things she wished she had n't done . Instead only one question consumed her soul . How in the world would her family live without her ? The idea of meeting with the birth mother gave Erin Hogan a bad feeling from the beginning . Their adoption attorney had warned them against it , but with four weeks until their baby daughter 's birth , Erin could n't tell the woman no . Sam agreed . Whatever the outcome , they would meet the birth mother , hear what she had to say , and pray that nothing-absolutely nothing-would damage the dream of bringing home their daughter . The meeting was set to take place in thirty minutes at a small park not far from Erin and Sam 's Austin home , where they would spend an hour with the birth mother , Candy Santana , and her two children . On the way out the door that day Erin 's stomach hurt . " Sam ? " She paused near the nursery door and gazed in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran his fingers over her arms . " You 're worried . " " Yes . " The nursery was entirely pink and white : pink walls and a white crib with pink bedding , and dresser topped with pink teddy bears . It smelled faintly of fresh paint and baby powder . Erin folded her arms and pressed her fist into her middle . " Everything 's been going so well . " Her eyes found Sam 's . " Why now ? " " I do n't know . " He kissed the top of her head and studied the nursery . " Maybe she wants to see how excited we are . " The possibility seemed like a stretch . Despite the warm March Texas morning , Erin shivered and turned toward the front door . " Let 's get it over with . " The short ride to the park was silent , mostly because Erin was afraid to talk , afraid to speculate about what might happen or why in the world the birth mother would want to meet them now . Without the social worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed toward a picnic table . Ten minutes later a young woman and two small girls headed toward them . Next to her was a thin man with long hair and mean , dark eyes . " Who 's he ? " Erin whispered . They were sitting on top of the table , their feet on the bench as they waited . Sam frowned . " Trouble . " The approaching couple held hands . As they drew closer Erin felt the knot in her stomach grow . Candy was very pregnant , dressed in worn-out , dirty clothes and broken flip-flops . The man 's arms were splattered with tattoos . On one was a rooster with a full plume of feathers and the word cock in cursive beneath it . The other arm had the full naked figure of a woman framed on top by the name Bonnie . Erin swallowed to keep from shuddering . She lowered her gaze to the girls , who were running a few feet in front of the adults . Candy 's youngest daughter was maybe two years old and wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much older , had a runny nose . Both children had blonde matted hair , lifeless eyes , and vacant expressions . The look of neglect and emotional disconnect . The same way Candy 's unborn child would look one day if something happened to the adoption process , or if Candy changed her-No , God ... do n't let me think like that . The couple was a few feet away now , and Erin could feel the color draining from her face . Please ... get us through this meeting . " Hi . " Candy gave them a look that fell short of a smile . The right side of her upper lip twitched , and she rubbed her thumb against it . " This is Dave . The baby 's dad . " The baby 's dad ? A thin wire of terror wrapped itself around Erin 's neck . " Uh ... " She forced herself to smile . " Hello . I 'm Erin . " Next to her , Sam held out his hand to the tattooed man . " Hi . " Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam or Erin in the eyes . Instead he shifted his gaze from Candy to the girls , to the ground , and back to Candy again . He grunted something that might 've been a greeting . Erin was n't sure . For a moment no one said anything . Then Candy cleared her throat and glanced at her daughters . The youngest had picked a dandelion and was chewing on the stem . " Hey ! " Candy pointed at the girl and let loose a string of expletives . " I told you a hundred times do n't be stupid , Clarisse , and I mean it . You ai n't a goat ; take the flower outta your mouth . " The girl lifted her eyes in Candy 's direction . " No ! " She put the flower stem between her lips . Candy mumbled something as she stomped over to the child and grabbed her arm . " Let it go ! " Fear filled the girl 's eyes . She dropped the flower and tried to back away from Candy . The woman released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the table she seemed to realize what she 'd done , the way she 'd behaved toward her daughter . A nervous look flashed in her eyes , and the lip twitched again . Candy managed a frustrated smile . " Crazy kids . " Erin did n't know what to say . She looked at her hands , at her wedding ring . God ... what 's this about ? She lifted her eyes and looked from Candy to Dave . The tattooed man cleared his throat and gave Candy a pointed look . Candy nodded and turned to Erin . " We , uh ... we have something to talk to ya about . " The knot in Erin 's stomach doubled . She felt Sam take her hand and give it a firm squeeze . " Okay . " Erin massaged her throat for a few seconds . " We 're ... we 're very excited about the adoption . Nothing 's changed . " " Has something changed for you , Candy ? " Sam 's voice was even , but his words made Erin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look , and the twitching in Candy 's lip grew worse . " No , it 's just ... " She looked at the ground for a moment . " We kinda ran into some money troubles , you know ? Tough to get a job when you 're , you know , pregnant and everything . " The instant Erin heard the word money , she relaxed . Was that all this was about ? Candy was short on rent and needed a few hundred dollars ? Their attorney had warned them against giving Candy additional money . Her financial needs during the pregnancy had already been taken care of , and Candy had signed a paper agreeing not to ask for anything extra . But if she needed more money , then so be it . A few hundred dollars and they could all move on like before . Erin 's heart rate slowed some . Her baby 's face came to mind , the smooth skin and fine features , the way she 'd always pictured her . Amy Elizabeth , their first child . Everything would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at Candy . " That happens . " A fine line of moisture gathered along his upper lip . " Money gets tight for everyone . " Dave shifted his weight to the opposite foot . He gripped the tattoo on his left arm . " What she 's saying- " he cocked his head- " is we need more money . " There it was . Erin swallowed . In case they 'd had any doubts , now the request-a request all of them knew was against the rules-was out in the open . She caught Sam 's look and gave him a silent go-ahead . He stared at Candy . " Have you talked to the lawyer ? I believe we agreed on what you needed . " " It was n't enough . " Candy glared at Sam . " You try raising kids and being pregnant on that kind of money . " Raising kids ? Erin gritted her teeth . Candy was n't raising the girls ; their pastor had confirmed that on several occasions . Candy 's mother was taking care of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show . " Here 's the deal . " Dave pressed the toe of his worn boot into the ground and dug his hands in his pockets . He grinned , and Erin could see a gold stud in the center of his tongue . " We need more . " For a while no one said anything . The girls were quiet , still playing a distance away . Finally Erin found her voice and directed her attention to Candy . " How much ? " Above them , a warm wind played in the trees that lined the park . Candy pursed her lips . " Five thousand . " Erin had to grip Sam 's arm to keep from falling off the bench . Five thousand ? The adoption had already cost them their entire savings ; they could never come up with that much money before the baby was born . Candy was saying something , trying to explain , but Erin could n't concentrate , could n't hear anything but the number . Five thousand dollars ? The figure tore at the picture of the unborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a little girl cradled in her arms . She gasped for breath and turned toward her husband . " Sam ... " He covered her hand with his , his teeth clenched . The figure was still finding its way to the recesses of Erin 's mind when Dave delivered the final blow . " Five thousand in twenty-four hours . " He flashed a smile that fell far short of his eyes . " Or the deal 's off . " The blood test had been the doctor 's idea . Not because he doubted whether she was HIV-positive . In fact , since he 'd taken over Ashley 's case , the doctor had called the original lab and discovered that they had done two tests with the original blood sample . Both were positive . Rather , he wanted a complete panel on her , a breakdown of her enzymes and mineral levels and every other test that might determine how healthy she was , how compromised her immune system . And most of all , what method of treatment to take . Ashley expected the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last time , but this warm Friday morning stuck in the middle of a stack of mail was a thick envelope from the lab . Ashley studied it as she made her way back into the house . Cole was inside , writing his alphabet on a piece of paper . He grinned at her from the dining-room table as she walked in . " Hi , Mom . " His feet did n't quite reach the floor , and he swung them under his seat . " I 'm on T already . " " Really ? " Ashley 's eyes were back on the envelope . " That 's great , buddy . Tell me when you 're done so I can check it . " She went into the kitchen and set the rest of the mail on a desk by the telephone . She stared at the thick envelope , slipped her thumb beneath the flap , and pulled out the stapled document . Next to her name , the top sheet read " Lab Results . " Ashley had no reason to feel nervous or strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was only a matter of how her blood was holding up under the compromise of HIV , and whether any sort of progression toward full-blown AIDS could be seen . Her eyes darted over the page , anxious for the summary lines , the places where any untrained person could make sense of the numbers and calculations . Then , at the bottom of the first sheet she saw it . A simple few lines with only a few words that made Ashley 's heart skitter into a strange and unrecognizable beat . She sucked in a quick breath and blinked hard . It was impossible ; she could n't believe it , would n't believe it . Someone had to have made a mistake . Her head began to spin , and she gripped the counter to keep from falling to the floor . She had to find Landon , had to tell him . " Mommy ... I 'm all done ! " Cole 's singsong voice called out to her from the adjacent room . " Come check . " " Okay . " Ashley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she got too close to a campfire . " Just a minute . " She pressed her hands against her cheeks and jerked back . Her fingers were freezing . She found the results line again . They could n't be right , could they ? A chill made its way from the back of her head , down her spine , and into her feet . God , is it true ? Is it really true ? Then one last time she studied the lab results and began to imagine that maybe-just maybe-they were right . It was n't possible , but still ... what if ? What if she 'd come this far , given up so much , only to find out this ? She was n't sure whether to scream or shout or break down on the floor and cry . But she was sure of one thing . If the results were accurate , from this moment on , her life would never be the same again . ( Continues ... )              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
