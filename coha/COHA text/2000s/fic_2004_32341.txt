Chapter One The swim party seemed like a great idea , the perfect ending to a perfect summer . Brooke Baxter West 's partner at the pediatric office had a daughter Maddie 's age , and to celebrate her birthday , the family had invited ten kids and their parents for an afternoon in their backyard pool . For two weeks the girls had talked about it nonstop , seeking out Brooke each morning and tugging on her arm . " Mommy , when 's the swim party ? " But two days before the big event , another doctor at the office had received word from California that his aging grandmother had only days to live . Before he caught an emergency flight , he 'd asked Brooke if she 'd take his on-call duty for the weekend . " You 're my last hope , " he told her . " My family needs me . " Brooke hated being on call when she had plans to spend an afternoon with her girls . But other than the swim party , the weekend was open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances of getting a Saturday afternoon call were fairly slim . Saturday evening , yes . But not Saturday afternoon . Now the big day was here , and Brooke was having doubts . She should 've called around , found someone else to take the doctor 's on-call duty . Her kids wanted her at the party , and if a call came in , she 'd miss the summer 's last hurrah . Brooke slipped a pair of shorts on over her swimsuit . She was raising the zipper when she heard Peter 's voice downstairs . " Hurry up , let 's go . " Frustration rang in his voice . " The party starts in ten minutes . " Brooke rolled her eyes and grabbed her bag-the one with the life jackets and sunscreen . What was wrong with him ? He was constantly grouchy ; the two of them had n't had a normal conversation in weeks . Their home was so tense even little Hayley had noticed it . " Is Daddy mad at you , Mommy ? " she 'd asked earlier that week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that yes , they should pray for him . But after days of sidestepping him , she was sick of Peter 's attitude . He made her feel incompetent and irritating . The same way he 'd made her feel ever since Maddie 's diagnosis . Did n't he get it ? Maddie was better now ; no fevers for more than two months . Brooke headed into the hallway and ran into Hayley and Maddie . " Guess what , girls ? " A glance at the grins on her daughters ' faces and her smile came easily . " I 'm wearing my swimsuit ! " " Goodie , Mommy . " Maddie jumped up and down and reached for Hayley 's hand . " We can play tea party on the steps . " They joined Peter downstairs and but for the girls ' excited chatter , they rode in silence to the house across town where Brooke 's partner , Aletha , and her husband , DeWayne , lived . At three years old , Hayley was still small enough to carry , so Brooke swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the front door . On the way up the steps , Hayley took hold of Brooke 's hand and squeezed it three times . The sign Brooke used with the girls to say , " I love you . " The love from her younger daughter was the perfect remedy for Peter 's coolness . " You 're a sweet girl , Hayley ; do you know that ? " She shifted her pool bag to her shoulder . " You , too , Mommy . " Hayley rubbed her tiny nose against Brooke 's . " You 're a sweetie girl , too . Know why ? " " Why ? " Brooke and Hayley trailed behind , and Brooke took her time . She loved moments like this with her girls . " Because- " Hayley tilted her head , her pale blonde hair falling like silk around her wide-eyed face- " I love you , that 's why . " The door opened and Aletha smiled at them from the front step . " Hi . The party 's out back . " Peter pulled out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Brooke studied him , confused and hurt . Why could n't he smile that way at her ? She 'd been meaning to ask him , but she had n't found the chance . She was a few feet from the front door when her pager went off . She exhaled hard as she unclipped the pager from her waistband and stared at the small message window . Urgent , it read . The word was followed by the hospital 's main number . Great , she thought . I wo n't get even an hour with them in the pool . Peter came up behind her and looked over her shoulder . " What is it ? " " A hospital call . " She did n't hide the disappointment in her voice . " Maybe it 's nothing . " Several children , breathless and excited , ran into the foyer and surrounded Hayley and Maddie . Brooke ducked into the nearest bedroom and pulled her cell phone from her purse . " Dr. Brooke Baxter West here . Someone paged me . " The nurse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patients from their office had been admitted with a staph infection . It looked serious . They wanted a pediatrician to consult . Immediately . " I 'm on my way . " Brooke hung up the phone and returned to the foyer . Peter caught her look and raised his eyebrows . " Well ? " " I have to go . " She pursed her lips . Doctoring was the most exhilarating career she could imagine having . But not when it interfered with her family . " I 'll be back as quick as I can . " " It 's your own fault . " A ribbon of anger wrapped itself around her heart . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Peter shrugged , his eyes distant . " You took the on-call . " Maddie ran up to her . " Natasha wants us to swim , Mommy . Can we , please ? Can we right now ? " " Um , baby- " she looked at Hayley standing a foot away , waiting for her answer- " why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can swim then , too . Please , Mommy ? Can we ? " Natasha did a little dance nearby and hugged Brooke . Their families had been friends for years , and Maddie and Natasha were best buddies . " Please , can we swim ? " Natasha linked arms with Maddie and the two smiled their best smiles . Brooke could feel the fight leaving her . So she 'd miss out on some of the fun . If she hurried , she 'd be back in time to join them in the pool . " Okay . " She allowed a slight smile . " But let me talk to Daddy first . " Peter had moved into the living room , and Brooke found him and DeWayne seated side by side , their eyes glued to the television . A baseball playoff game was on , and Aletha had joked that having the party at that time could mean the men might never leave the TV . Brooke crossed the room and positioned herself between her husband and the big screen . " The girls want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she set it on the floor between them . " Here 's the sunscreen and life jackets . The girls need both before they can go out back . " " Right . " Peter leaned sideways so he could see the game . " I got it , honey . " The term of endearment was for DeWayne 's benefit , Brooke was sure . She did n't appreciate the way he looked past her to the game . " Peter , I 'm serious . Do n't let them outside without sunscreen and a life jacket . They 're not pool safe . " He shot her a look , one that said she was embarrassing him . Then he yelled out , " Hayley ... Maddie , come here . " The girls scampered into the room and came up close to Peter . " Yes , Daddy . " Hayley spoke first . " Can we swim ? " " Not yet . " Peter looked hard at Brooke and unzipped the bag . Quickly and with little finesse , he lathered sunscreen into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do Hayley . " She needed to leave , but this was more important . Moving as fast as she could , she squeezed the lotion into her hand and positioned herself in front of their little blonde daughter . " Here , sweetie . We do n't want a sunburn , right ? " " Right , Mommy . " Brooke rubbed the sunscreen over Hayley 's arms and legs , her back and neck , and finally her face . She and Peter finished with the girls at the same time , and Peter tossed her the smaller life jacket . He said nothing as they worked , and that was fine with Brooke . These days , the less he said the better . She took the blue-and-aqua life jacket and slipped first one of Hayley 's arms , then the other , through the holes . Next she latched the buckles down the front and attached a strap that ran from the back of the vest , between her legs , to the front . Brooke had researched life jackets , and this style was the safest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter gave Brooke one last glare . Again because of DeWayne seated beside him , he kept his tone light , almost friendly . " There you go . See you later . " Brooke said nothing . Instead she turned and bid the girls a quick good-bye . She found Aletha and promised to be back as soon as possible . A minute later she was in the car , doing a U-turn toward the hospital . With every mile she felt the distance between herself and her daughters . They were playing in the pool by now , getting used to the water , their little-girl laughter ringing across Aletha 's backyard . She stepped on the gas . She 'd make this the quickest call ever and be back before the underwater tea party even began . Then-other than her relationship with Peter-everything about the day would play out just like it was supposed to . * * * Peter was grateful for the National League Championship Series on TV . Because as much as he liked DeWayne and Aletha , the last thing he wanted was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't his thing , and the current series was easily one of the most exciting ever . Besides , most of the guests were Brooke 's friends , people he barely knew . The prospect of catching a game with DeWayne had swayed him to come . Especially after Brooke took the on-call assignment . What had she been thinking ? Of course she 'd get called Saturday afternoon ; kids needed doctors then most of all . Soccer injuries , illnesses that had brewed all week at school . Insect bites . Weekends were notoriously busy for pediatricians . The fact that she 'd let the other doctor talk her into taking his on-call was further proof that she was n't capable . Not nearly as capable as he 'd originally thought her to be . Back when they 'd met in med school , her confidence and competence had been part of what attracted him to her . But after the situation with Maddie-when she 'd insisted that their daughter did n't need a specialist-Peter had seen his wife in a new light . One that was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children came from the other room . " Okay , " he heard Aletha tell them . " Dry off , and we 'll have cake . " It was the seventh inning , and his team was down by one . Peter hoped they could keep the cake thing quiet-at least until the commercial . Not that he did n't like birthdays , but he 'd had one of the longest weeks in his life . His patients had needed him more than usual , he 'd gone without sleep for two days , and now-on his day off-he was spending his Saturday at a kid 's birthday party . At that instant-with the tying run on third and a power hitter at the plate-Maddie and Hayley ran into the room . They were shivering , and their life jackets made a trail of dripping water . " Daddy , can you take off our jackets ? " He glanced at them and then back at the TV . " Just a minute , girls . Daddy wants to see this . " The count was 3-0 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and connected , but the ball flew over the catcher and into the stands . Foul tip . Strike one . " Okay . " Peter looked at his daughters again . " Now what ? " " We 're dripping , Daddy . " Maddie took a step forward . " Can you take off our jackets ? Please ? " " Sure , pumpkin . " He unsnapped the buckles on both vests and helped take them off . " Give them to Natasha 's mommy and ask her to hang them near the bathtub . " The next pitch was a perfect strike , one that caught the hitter looking . Full count . " Daddy ... " Hayley stepped up . " When 's Mommy coming back ? We 're a'posed to have a tea party with her in the pool . " " Soon , baby . " He leaned around her and watched the man at bat belt one out of the park . The moment it was gone , he and DeWayne stood up and slapped their hands in a high five . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " DeWayne gave a few nods and sat back down . " On their way , baby . On their way . " " Daddy ... " Hayley angled her head . " I love you . " " Right . " Peter eased himself back to his seat . His eyes returned to the game . " Love you , too . " " Bye . " Maddie turned and dashed from the room , her life jacket slung over her arm . " Bye , Daddy . " Hayley was close on her sister 's heels . " Bye . " Peter studied the screen and then remembered something . " Do n't go outside without those life jackets . " But the girls were already out of the room . He stared after his girls , and even with the noise from the game he could almost hear Brooke telling him to find them , make sure they understood about the life jackets . But the game was almost over , and anyway , the kids were about to eat cake . He could remind them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all his attention centered once more on the game . A single and a stolen base , another single and a sacrifice fly . Two-run lead . If they won this game they 'd take a three-two lead and the series would be as good as over . Instead , the pitcher struck out the next two batters , and in the following inning the other team scored two runs to tie it up . Not until the bottom of the ninth inning did his team score the winning run . The game ended , the win forever in the books , and Peter was thirty minutes into a discussion on the merits of switch-hitting and relief pitching when he heard Maddie call him from the other room . " Daddy ! Daddy , quick ! Help ! " He held up his hand to DeWayne . " Just a minute . " He raised his voice . " In here , baby . " Maddie tore around the corner . Her hair was dry , her eyes round with fear . " Daddy , I ca n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart suddenly in his throat . " What do you mean ? " Fear dug its talons into his back , his neck . It was all he could do to keep from sprinting toward the backyard . " I thought you were eating cake . " " We did . Then we ' cided to go swimming , Daddy . " Maddie 's mouth hung open . " But Hayley said she wanted to be first to get the tea party ready for Mommy . Now I ca n't find her- " Peter did n't wait for Maddie to finish . He took off for the patio door , not so much because of what Maddie had said but because of the thing she was holding in her hands . The thing Peter had only that instant recognized . Hayley 's life jacket . ( Continues ... )
