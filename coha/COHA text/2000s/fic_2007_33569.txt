Ottawa , Canada , the present Cold . Just as the gray day slid toward evening , the north wind brisked up , bringing rain so cold it turned to ice that stuck to whatever it touched . The bare branches of the trees along Elgin Street were sheathed in a glistening armor that dragged them down and froze them to the ground . The smallest twigs had snapped but the chill coating held them in place , would not let them fall . The small man in the plaid wool jacket and black knitted cap walked into the wind , broad shoulders hunched , scarred hands deep in the pockets of his tattered jeans . But his face met the icy blast straight on , let the frozen crystals sting his skin and make the bones beneath the flesh ache , as if they were being scraped by knives . Pain was good . Pain was real . It cut through the fog inside him , slashed through the roiling , colorless nothingness that stuffed his head . With pain came memory  --  or what passed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names nor places to events , a mind that did not know if the pictures it conjured to fill its inner screen came from true recall or false , maybe just from dreams , or stories he 'd heard . Or from the nightmares that chased him , screaming in rage and horror , back into wakefulness , back into the fog . Heya , heya , heya . At first he thought the chant was coming from inside his head . Sometimes he heard voices , random scraps of speech , mostly in English , sometimes in other languages that he understood . Heya , heya , heya it came again , louder now as his steps took him past Confederation Park . Off to his right , unseen behind the white rain , someone was beating a drum , a simple double-beat rhythm to accompany the voice . I 've heard that before , the man thought . He stopped and let the sound pass through him , held his mind back when it tried to get a grip on the memory . He 'd learned that grasping did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to grab smoke . Heya , heya , heya with the drum beating underneath  --  bom-bom , bom-bom , bom-bom  --  like somebody had cut open the world to show its living heart , he thought . And that brought up an image : a man split from gullet to groin , lying on his back , looking up , his eyes clouding in death . Who is that man ? He could n't help reaching for the memory , but even as he grasped for it , the picture faded , the dead eyes the last to go . Still , the drum and the chant continued . The small man turned toward them and went into the park , not following the concrete path that was slick with ice but walking through short winter grass that crackled and broke beneath his heavy boots . Something big ahead , he thought . Through the rain he saw a block of gray surmounted by dark shapes  --  people , animals , a great bird with wings spread wide . Now he came close enough to see that it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three men and a woman , cast in dark bronze . Around them were four animals  --  grizzly , wolf , bison , and caribou  --  and above their heads a giant eagle soared . On the front of the plinth , a plaque announced in English and French that the monument commemorated the sacrifices of the First Nations , Mtis and Inuit men and women who had worn Canadian uniforms in wars and peacekeeping missions . The drumming and chanting were coming from the far side , but the small man 's eyes had dropped from the heroic figures to the two rows of flowered wreaths , standing on wire tripods , that were ranged along the steps leading up to the monument . He had a vague sense that the presence of the wreaths meant that it must be not long since the Remembrance Day observances of November 11 . The date brought a flash of memory  --  a soundless image of men with weary faces and mud-spattered uniforms throwing helmets shaped like soup bowls into the air , some with mouths set in bitter smiles , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wreaths drew his gaze . It stood apart from the others , a small circle of dark red flowers woven through evergreen boughs . At its center , encased in plastic , was a framed photograph of a man with strongly aboriginal features , the cheeks flat-planed , the narrow eyes almost asiatic . He wore a beret with a parachute badge . Beneath the picture , a wide ribbon bore the legend Sgt. Thomas George Prince , 1915-1977 . The chant and drum grew louder , but the small man did not move . He stared at the black-and-white image and the man in the photo looked back at him with the confident half smile of the consummate warrior , a smile that said , I know who I am and I know what I can do . But it was n't the smile that held the man motionless in the freezing rain , staring at the image while the ice built on his shoulders and covered his wool cap like a helmet . He stared at the picture of the aboriginal sergeant in the old-fashioned , British-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dry earth , small trees with dark leaves and clumps of green fruit  --  olive trees , said his own voice in his head  --  a dusty road and soldiers marching in puttees and canvas webbing , bolt-action rifles slung from their shoulders . " I know you , " he said , his voice a grating whisper . And as he spoke the drum ceased , the chant ended on one last heya . The small man stooped and reached for the photograph . It came free of the wreath . He pulled the ribbon loose and wrapped it tightly around the plastic-covered cardboard , then he opened his coat and stuffed both prizes inside , against the worn checked shirt that covered his hard-muscled torso . He buttoned the coat back up . Now he stood in the falling sleet that whispered as it struck the ground , no longer noticing the bite of the wind that made the ice-covered trees rattle like dead men 's bones . He put his hand to his chest , pressed the cardboard against the beat of his heart , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped around the monument to find the drummer and chanter , no one was there .
