When a President leaves office we expect him to disappear for a while , cede the stage to the new guy , give us some time to forget why we were n't so sorry to see him go . Jimmy Carter returned to Plains , Ga. , to nurse his wounds and work on his house ; George Herbert Walker Bush disappeared to Houston , content to load his dishwasher and walk his dogs . But from the hour Bill Clinton 's successor was sworn in , the youngest former President in modern history made it clear that he did n't intend to fade from view for even a minute . " I 'm still here , " he declared as the jet engines revved at Andrews Air Force Base . " We 're not going anywhere . " The almost spoken promise : Clinton would dominate the power salons of New York City , bask in ovations on the lecture circuit , run the Democratic Party and lead the opposition in the national debate over George W. Bush 's agenda . It would be a bold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shaping up to be a shriveled version of his presidency . As he copes with a new crop of scandals  --  the $190,000 worth of going-away gifts , the $800,000-a-year midtown-Manhattan office suite he wanted to rent , the 177 last-minute clemencies he granted and , above all , the one he handed to fugitive billionaire Marc Rich  --  Clinton 's new life feels like the old one , minus the power and the pulpit and the retinue of aides . His war room is a half-furnished Dutch Colonial in the New York suburbs ; his lieutenant , a former White House valet named Oscar who keeps Clinton supplied with diet Coke while the ex-President dials through the numbers he has entered on his new , imperfectly mastered PalmPilot , calling to justify himself to his friends . Clinton 's red-faced rages over the Rich scandal have familiar themes : " setups , " overzealous prosecutors , unfair legal cases that never should have gone to indictment . What is hard to figure out is whether he is playing out his reasons for pardoning a fugitive or working through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rich or himself by proxy ? Either way , sighs a comrade who answered the phone recently to find the 42nd President of the U.S. on the other end of the line , " you get tired of listening to it . " <P> A meteorologist might call Clinton 's first month out of office a perfect storm : a freak convergence of fast-moving , late-season weather patterns , a lethal collision of the profound and the trivial . The thunderhead of accusations confirms every fair and unfair thing his enemies have ever said about him  --  and puts him once again in the sights of a federal prosecutor , this time U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White of New York . Not only are there calls to haul him before Congress , but also they are coming from fellow Democrats who defended him through every past scandal . This time , for the first time , he is out on the cliff , alone . <P> As Clinton 's former Commerce Secretary denounces him and Morgan Stanley apologizes to its clients for paying him to speak , Clinton is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been spoiled by the calls that are flooding her makeshift work space in the basement of the Dirksen Senate Office Building . Hillary last week went to three Brooklyn churches to talk about racial profiling  --  and ended up answering questions about whether she had properly reported the glittery handbags she 'd received ( she had ) .
