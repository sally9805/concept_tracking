Feeling Low In A Valley // Once there was a bright young man who lived unhappily in a valley , until he went to see an old man who lived on a peak . When he was younger , he had been happy in his valley . He played in its meadows and swam in its river . // The valley was all he had ever known , and he thought he would spend his whole life there . // Some days in his valley were cloudy and some were sunny , but there was a sameness to his daily routine that he found comforting . // However , as he grew older , he began to see what was wrong more often than he noticed what was right . He wondered why he had not noticed before how many things were wrong in the valley . // As time went on , the young man became increasingly unhappy , although he was n't sure why . // He tried working at different jobs in the valley , but none turned out to be what he had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to criticize him for what he did wrong and never noticed all the things he did right . // In another , he was one of so many employees that it did n't seem to matter to anyone whether he worked hard or hardly worked at all . His contribution seemed invisible , even to himself . // Once , he thought he had finally found what he wanted . He felt appreciated and challenged , he worked with capable colleagues , and he was proud of the company 's product . He worked his way up and became manager of a small department . // Unfortunately , he felt his job was not secure . // His personal life was no better . One disappointment seemed to follow another . // He thought his friends did n't understand , and his family told him he was " just going through a phase . " // The young man wondered if he would be better off someplace else . // Sometimes the young man would stand in the meadow and look up at the range of majestic peaks that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the nearby peak . // For a while , he felt better . // But the more he compared the peak to his valley , the worse he felt . // He spoke to his parents and friends about going to the peak . But they talked only about how difficult it was to reach the peak , and how comfortable it was to stay in the valley . // They all discouraged him from going where they themselves had never been . // The young man loved his parents and knew there was some truth to what they said . But he also knew that he was a different person from his father and mother . // Sometimes he felt there might be a different way of life outside the valley , and he wanted to discover it for himself . Maybe on the peak he could gain a better view of the world . // But then doubt and fear crept in again , and he thought he would stay where he was . // For a long time the young man could not bring himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled his early youth and realized how much had changed since then . He was no longer at peace with himself . // He was n't sure why he changed his mind , but he suddenly decided he had to go visit that mountaintop. // He put his fear aside and got ready to leave as quickly as he could . Then , he set out for the nearby peak . // It was not an easy journey . It took him much longer than he thought it would to make it less than halfway up the peak . // But as the young man went higher , the cool breeze and fresh air revitalized him . From higher up , his valley looked smaller . // When he had been down in the valley , the air seemed clean enough . But when he viewed the valley from above , he saw the pale brown stagnant air that was trapped there . // Then he turned and continued upward . The higher he climbed , the more he could see . // Suddenly , the trail he was following ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost among the thick trees that blocked out the light . He feared he would not find his way out . // So , he decided to cross a dangerously narrow ridge . As he did , he fell . Bruised and bleeding , he picked himself up and continued on . // Eventually , he found a new path . // The warnings of the people in the valley crossed his mind . But then he gathered his courage and kept climbing . // The higher he went , the happier he became , knowing that he was leaving the valley and putting aside his fears . // He was on his way to someplace new . // As he rose above the clouds , he realized it was a beautiful day and imagined how the sunset would look from the summit . He could hardly wait to see it from up there .
