Hamburg , Germany July 17 , 1973 Tuesday Morning ROTH BRAUN SLOWLY TWISTED THE DOORKNOB AND GAVE THE door a slight shove . A familiar medicinal odor stung his nostrils . Outside , the sun warmed a midsummer day , but here in the dungeon below the house , the old man lived in perpetual twilight . Roth imagined a Jew stepping into a delicing shower and let himself relish the horror he might feel in that moment of realizing that more than lice were meant to die in this chamber . Roth was in a very good mood . The smothering quiet was broken by the sound of the old prune 's tarred , seventy-eight-year-old lungs rasping for relief . Gerhard 's wheezing annoyed Roth , ruining his otherwise perfect mood . The only living soul he despised more than the Jew who 'd stolen his power was Gerhard , who had allowed the Jew to steal his power . He glanced at Klaus , the gangly male nurse who had tended his father for three years . The white-smocked man hovered over Gerhard in the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gerhard Braun sat in a dark-red leather recliner , blue eyes glaring over the nasal cannula protruding from each nostril . " Good morning , Father , " Roth said . He closed the door quietly and stepped into the room , pushing aside a curtain of tinkling glass beads that separated it from the entryway . " You wanted to see me ? " His father looked at a servant , who busied himself over the table in the adjacent dining room . " Leave us . " By the trembling in his voice , either Gerhard really was dying , or something was upsetting him , which invariably sowed its own sort of death . How many men alive today had been responsible for as many deathsas his father ? They could be counted on two hands . Even so , Roth hated him . The servant dipped his head and exited through a side door . The steel door closed and the nurse flinched . Glass in a cabinet behind the table rattled despite the room 's solid-concrete walls . The nineteenth-century Russian crystal -- one of dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ czar . The Nazis ' defeat should have sent Gerhard to the gallows ; instead , the war had left his father with obscene wealth . The paintings alone had netted him a significant fortune , and these he owned legally . He 'd shipped them to Zurich , where a hotly contested law made them his after remaining unclaimed for five years . Compliments of the Swiss Federation of Art Dealers . Until the day I suck the energy from your bones , I will love you for showing me the way . Until the day I suck the energy from your bones , I will despise you for what you did . Gerhard held up a newspaper . " Have you read this ? " Roth walked across the circular rope rug that covered the black cement slab and stopped five feet from Gerhard . A hawk nose curved over his father 's thin , trembling lips . Wispy strands of gray hair backlit by a yellow lamp hovered over his scalp . Skeletal , blue-veined fingers clutched what appeared to be a Los Angeles Times . A stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Daily Telegraph , and a dozen others --  sat a half-meter thick on the small end table to his left . Gerhard routinely spent six hours each day reading . Gerhard flung the paper with a flick of his wrist , never removing his eyes from Roth . It landed on the floor with a smack . " Read it . " The male nurse pretended to fiddle with the oxygen tank . Roth stood still . This attitude of Gerhard 's was no longer simply ruining his mood , but destroying it altogether . " I said , ' Read it ' ! " Roth calmly bent and picked up the paper . The Los Angeles Times was folded around an article in the Life section , " Fortune Goes to Museum . " Roth scanned the text . A wealthy woman , a Jew named Rachel Spritzer , sixty-two years of age , had died three days ago in Los Angeles . She 'd been survived by no one and had donated her entire estate to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust . " So another Jew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy lives on . " His father clutched the arms of his chair . " Read the rest . " His chest sounded like a whistle . If Roth was n't a master of his own impulses , he might have done something stupid , such as kill the man . Instead , he set the paper on the windowsill and turned away . " You 've read it , Father . Tell me what it says . I have a ten o'clock engagement . " " Cancel it . " Roth walked to the bar . Control . " Just tell me what has you so concerned . " " The Stones of David have me concerned . " Roth blinked . He poured a splash of cognac into a snifter . " I 'm finished chasing your ghosts . " He swirled the brandy slowly before sipping it . " If the Stones still exist , we would have found them long ago . " Gerhard managed to stand , trembling from head to foot , red as a rooster around the neck . " They have been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched into a coughing fit . Roth 's pulse quickened a hair and then eased . If the man was n't dying , he was losing his mind . Surely the Stones had n't been found after all this time . Gerhard staggered three steps to the windowsill , pushing his startled nurse out of the way , and grabbed the newspaper . He leaned on the wall with one hand and held the paper up in the other . He threw the paper toward Roth . It fluttered noisily and landed on the black slab . " Read it ! " Gerhard 's eyes drilled him . So then maybe there was something to this . Roth picked up the paper , found the article , and slowly read down the column . What if Gerhard was right ? What if the relics did exist after all ? They would be priceless . But the Stones ' monetary value did n't interest Gerhard -- he already had enough wealth to waste in his final years . Gerhard 's obsession was for the journal that had gone missing with the Stones . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing with the Jew who 'd taken the journal . He had spent nearly thirty years tracking down innumerable leads , searching in vain . There was no telling how much wealth had been stripped from the Jews when Hitler had gathered them up and sent them to the camps . Much of the fortune had been confiscated by the gestapo and recovered after the war , but a number of particularly valuable items --  priceless relics that belonged in museums or in vaults -- had disappeared . Some of those treasures could be found in this very house . But any wellheeled collector knew that the most valuable collection had vanished for good in 1945 . The Stones of David . One stunning item in Spritzer 's collection is an extremely old golden medallion , better known as one of the five Stones of David . According to legend , the medallions are the actual stones selected by David to kill the giant Goliath . The smooth stones were subsequently gilded and stamped with the Star of David . The collection was last verified in 1307 , when they were held by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wealthy Jewish collector before World War II but went missing before the claim could be verified . Alone , each medallion may be worth over $10,000,000 . But the collection in its entirety is valued at roughly $100,000,000 . The relic will be displayed in a museum yet to be disclosed with the following cryptic caption at Rachel Spritzer 's request : " The Stones are like the lost orphans . They will eventually find each other . " Sweat cooled Roth 's palms . He set the paper on the bar , set an unsteady finger in its margin , and scanned to the end . Rachel Spritzer lived alone in an apartment complex she owned on La Brea Avenue and died a widow . The complex will be sold by the estate , along with much of Spritzer 's noncollectible property . Rudy and Rachel Spritzer immigrated to the United States sixteen years ago , five years before Rudy was killed in an automobile accident . ( See B4 . ) For a moment Roth 's vision clouded . His mouth went dry . " Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article again , searching for any phrase that might undermine the possibility that this Jew could be anyone other than whom Gerhard was suggesting . " She was sixty-two , " Gerhard said . " The right age . " Roth 's mind flashed back to those war years when he was only twelve . Even if the connections were only circumstantial , he could hardly ignore them . " I knew the Jew survived , " Gerhard said . " She donated only one Stone . There were five . " " If one Stone exists , then the journal exists . Someone has that journal ! " " She 's dead . " " You will make her speak from the grave . " Gerhard swayed on his feet , right fist trembling . His eyes looked black in the basement 's shadows . " She knew . She knew about the journal . " " She 's dead ! " Roth snapped . He took a deep breath , irritated with himself for losing control . The fact was , Gerhard 's history with the Stones gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know well enough that the journal implicates the entire line of elders . It lists each of our names and the names of the women we killed . It must be found ! " Mention of the women triggered a coppery taste in the back of Roth 's mouth . The last time he 'd seen the journal , it contained 243 names . Roth would one day surpass that number , he had vowed it . But even a thousand or ten thousand would not compensate for the one that had escaped Gerhard . " That woman would toy with me even in her death , " the old man said . " In her house , in her belongings -- somewhere , the old bat left a trail . You will go to Los Angeles . " The nurse , Klaus , moved to assist Gerhard back to his seat , but the old man shook him off . Klaus retreated . Gerhard was right . The Stones could lead to the journal . The journal could lead to the Jew . The Jew would lead to power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Roth would . The prospect of finding the Jew after so many years felt delightfully obscene . Roth realized that his fingers were trembling . " The United States , " Roth said absently . " We do n't have the same liberties there . " " That 's never stopped you before . " The notion swarmed Roth like bees from a disturbed hive . Hope . More than hope -- a desperate urgency to possess . Pounding heart , dry mouth . He was no fool . He would neither fight the emotion nor show it . After lingering so long on the edges of his mind , the desire to possess this one lost hope swallowed him . This is what Roth lived for , the purest form of power found in the very emotion that at this very moment raged through his body . In his mind 's eye he was already flying to America . He would have to move quickly , set the trap immediately . There was no telling how long they would keep the old Jew 's collectibles in Los Angeles . Roth stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , torn between the man 's mad obsession with the past and his own with the future . What Roth did for tomorrow , Gerhard did because of yesterday . Who was the better man ? He remembered the first dead Jew he 'd seen in the camps twenty-eight years ago . He 'd been eating fresh eggs and sausage prepared by one of the Polish servants from the village for breakfast . It was the most delicious breakfast he 'd ever tasted . Perhaps leaving his mother in Germany to spend the summer with his father up in Poland would be a good thing after all . He was twelve at the time . " Papa ? " " What ? " his father asked , walking toward the window overlooking the concentration camp . " Why do Polish eggs taste better than German eggs ? " His father pulled back the curtain , and Roth saw a woman hanging from the main gate . Gerhard answered him , but Roth did n't hear the response . The year was 1942 , and hers was the first of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something about the first . Roth let the memory linger , then returned his mind to the Stones.His father 's eyes glistened with tears ; his face wrinkled . " The Jew took my soul . She took my soul ! I beg you , my son . " Roth felt a terrible pity for him . A single tear broke free and ran down Gerhard 's right cheek . " If the Jew is alive , she will be drawn by the Stone , " Roth said . " Forget the Jew . I must have the journal . You see that , do n't you ? More than anything , I must have it . " He held out a spindly arm laced with bulging veins . " Swear it to me . Swear you 'll bring me what is mine . " Roth looked at the large swastika on the gray wall , sickened by Gerhard 's weakness . He would make it right , because the Stones meant far more to him than they could possibly mean to his father . " Come here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stepped out from the shadows . Roth backed up and stepped off the rug . There was the right way and the wrong way to do this , and the purest in mind knew the difference . " Farther , to the middle of the rug , " he said . Klaus took another step so that he stood near the center of the rug . " I would like to repay you for your care of my father , " Roth said . " Few men could put up with a whining old man the way you do . Is there anything you would like ? " No response . Of course not . " Anything at all ? " The nurse lowered his head . " No sir . " Roth pulled out his gun and shot Klaus through the top of his head while he was still bent over . The slug likely ended up in his throat . The man dropped in a pile . Roth looked at his father . " You should have sent him out . " " You 're working against your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure . " " Then I did him a favor by sending him to his grave pure . "
