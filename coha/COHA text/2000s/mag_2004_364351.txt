A sign of democracy 's failure to take root in the Arab world is the way authoritarian regimes muzzle the local media . So when the al-Jazeera satellite channel began its broadcasts in 1996 from the Persian Gulf state of Qatar , more than a digital revolution was born . For the first time , Arabs were able to watch news programs and talk shows in their own language and assembled by independent journalists rather than by government propagandists . <P> Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani , 53 , the Emir of Qatar , has shouldered the political burden and financial cost of sponsoring al-Jazeera . With an estimated 35 million viewers , the network is being imitated across the region . Al-Jazeera has angered Arab governments by giving airtime to rebel movements and freedom advocates and tackling taboo topics like polygamy and apostasy . And Arab opinion has been immeasurably influenced by al-Jazeera 's coverage of the Palestinian intifadeh and the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . But nothing has made al-Jazeera so famous as the journalistic hospitality it has extended to Osama bin Laden through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's executives say that bin Laden 's words are genuine scoops and , defending their professionalism , cite the network 's battle scars  --  its offices in Kabul and Baghdad came under fire from U.S. forces . <P> Skeptics sneer that the Emir has used al-Jazeera to put his tiny country on the map . He insists that the channel reflects a wind of change blowing through the Middle East . Arab regimes are certainly feeling more than a breeze .  --  By Scott MacLeod
