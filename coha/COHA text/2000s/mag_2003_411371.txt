. Some may call what follows obscure or esoteric . But rest assured that it can make you a better golfer , a smarter consumer and a more interesting 19th-hole blowhard . VERTICAL GEAR EFFECT It sounds like something NASA grapples with , but VGE can add yards to your drives . It occurs when a ball is struck above a club 's center of gravity . The force of impact rotates the clubface slightly upward , adding loft . " The centers of gravity of club and ball also pull toward each other like gears , reducing spin , " says Jeff Sheets , Golfsmith 's vice president of research and development . " Combine VGE with the correct launch angle , and you 'll get longer drives . " That helpful combination spurs manufacturers to make drivers with deeper faces . Just remember to use extra-long tees when you swing one  --  you need room to get the club 's center of gravity under the equator of the ball . HANDCRAFTED FORGINGS Traditionalists , stop reading here . The truth is , there 's no blacksmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any major factory . " Modern die materials and hydraulic equipment create extreme pressures to squeeze or press the material into the proper shape , " says Nike 's Dean Stoyer . It 's not romantic , just effective . " The process eliminates much of the need for hand-grinding , " says Harry Taylor , Mizuno 's vice president of club design . " The advantage is that clubs are more consistent from set to set , because we 're forging to weight instead of grinding . " More important , your new blades are uniform from club to club . BUNKER BLASTS Even though the sand wedge does n't get within one and a half inches of the ball on well-played bunker shots , these shots spin more than all others . " Our research with high-speed photography shows that sand reacts similarly to water when an object plunges into it , " says Dick Helmstetter , senior executive vice president of Call-away . " It does n't compress , so when you push down on it , there is nowhere for it to go but up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make the ball go up  --  and spin . " With a shallower angle of attack , the sand rebounds in a more horizontal direction , like water being sprayed out of a hose , " says Helmstetter . So swing down at a steep angle for Tour-quality bunker shots . DRIVER VS. 3-WOOD It 's hard to believe , but most players hit their 3-woods longer than they hit their drivers . " Average golfers do n't generate enough ball speed with a 10-degree driver to support the lower spin rate , " says Gene Parente , president of independent testing facility Golf Laboratories . Adds Sheets of Golfsmith , " A ball launched at 15 degrees tends to have a more stable flight than something lower , which for all but the strongest players translates into distance and accuracy . " He says golfers who swing 90 mph or slower should try a club with a driver-length shaft and 3-wood loft . CHECK YOUR BALLS While cheaper balls are typically constructed in two pieces with a hard Surlyn cover , tour-caliber balls usually have a three-piece construction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urethane , a softer , more expensive material . The result is better feel and more spin around greens , but a higher price tag . " Urethane is expensive to manufacture , and three layers instead of two costs more money to make , " says Bob Thurman , director of golf-ball research and development for Wilson . Even so , most two-piece balls give recreational players what they want  --  distance and affordability . CLOSED FACE VS . SQUARE FACE " Give the average golfer a driver with a square clubface and neutral weight distribution and he 'll slice the hell out of the ball , " says Sean Toulon , senior vice president at TaylorMade . Blame today 's huge driver heads . " As the head gets bigger , the center of gravity moves farther from the axis of the shaft , and the average player has a harder time squaring the face , " adds Toulon . As a result , many of the new 350cc-plus drivers feature a clubface that is one to two degrees closed . But if you hate looking down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw-bias weighting , which means the center of gravity is shaded toward the heel . SPIN DOCTORING Do n't listen to claims about a particular ball 's being the longest . Instead , focus on which is longest for you  --  and for your club . " The spin rates between balls differ so much , " says Toulon . " When you change balls , you 're potentially changing the dynamics of your launch conditions . " Translation : Switching to a low-spin ball may call for a driver that produces more spin for maximum distance . LAUNCH CONTROL ... YOU NEED IT Every golfer dreams of bombing drives . But since every golfer is different , a club that produces ideal launch characteristics for your buddy might not be for you . And you do n't really know if that new driver is fitted to your swing  --  or ball  --  until you get on a launch monitor . " Without that , finding the right head shape , loft and shaft combination is incredibly difficult , " says Chris McGinley , vice president of golf club marketing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some dramatic improvements .
