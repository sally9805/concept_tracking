Prologue // In the year 1606 , on a Roman tennis court , the artist Caravaggio killed an opponent after an argument over a foul call . A middle-aged mathematician named Galileo Galilei , who had not yet built his first telescope , published a book of observations about the recent appearance of a supernova in the sky . Japan ? s first shogun , Ieyasu Tokugawa , had recently begun his rule . The Dutch painter Rembrandt was born . In Oxford , Cambridge , and Canterbury , forty-seven scholars appointed by the king were laboring over a new translation of the Scriptures , which would come to be known as the King James Bible . A new play called Macbeth opened in London . And in late December , in London ? s River Thames , three small ships were anchored , awaiting a voyage across the Atlantic . // Those three ships  --  the Susan Constant , the Godspeed , and the Discovery  --  went on to change the course of history . After a series of fruitless attempts by the English to create an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke through . The colony that they established at Jamestown would open the way for later English settlements up and down the East Coast , and eventually for the United States itself . // The Jamestown colony was an entrepreneurial effort , organized and financed by the Virginia Company of London , a start-up venture chartered eight months earlier ; its business model was to extract profits from the gold , silver , and other riches supposedly to be found in that region of North America . Also , because no one yet knew the extent of the North American continent , the company expected to find a trade route by river through Virginia to the Pacific . ( Religious conversion of the natives was a distant third objective . ) The enterprise was a joint-stock company , its equity held by a limited circle of investors . In a little over two years , the Virginia Company would have its initial public stock offering at twelve pounds , ten shillings a share . English America was a corporation before it was a country . // Few of the investors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The colony ? s ultimate success would come at a fearsome price : disease , hunger , and hostile natives left behind a toll of misery and death . Most of the 105 or so adventurers who went on the ships would be dead within months , and that was only the first wave of mortality to hit the colony . // It ? s amazing the settlement survived at all . The alien territory of Virginia would have been a challenge to the best of explorers . But the 1606 expedition , by and large , was not made up of the best , or for that matter the brightest . Half of the colonists aboard the three ships were " gentlemen "  --  upper-class indolents who , as events unfolded , literally would not work to save their own lives . ( The true meaning of the word " gentleman " in those days is suggested by the 1605 George Chapman farce Eastward Ho , involving adventurers making ready for a voyage to Virginia ; one character instructs another , " Do nothing ; be like a gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Worse , the " gentlemen " of Jamestown comprised most of the colony ? s leaders , who came to revile and plot against one another as the sick and the starving were dropping dead around them . // The survival of the small English outpost was thanks mostly to two extraordinary people , one a commoner and one a royal . The commoner was Captain John Smith , a former soldier with an impatient nature and a total lack of respect for his social betters  --  or anyone else who hadn ? t proven himself through his merits . The royal was Pocahontas , the beautiful , headstrong daughter of the most powerful chief in Virginia . // The names of John Smith and Pocahontas have by now passed into American legend . Like the Jamestown story as a whole , their stories have been told over the generations with varying degrees of accuracy . The imaginative 1995 Walt Disney Co. movie , for example , endowed Pocahontas with a Barbie-doll figure , dressed her in a deerskin from Victoria ? s Secret , and made her Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang , // Captain Smith and Pocahontas // Had a very mad affair // When her daddy tried to kill him // She said , " Daddy , oh don ? t you dare // He gives me fever with his kisses // Fever when he holds me tight // Fever , I ? m his missus // Oh Daddy , won ? t you treat him right . " // Trouble is , Smith and Pocahontas were never romantically involved . That isn ? t surprising ; when Smith was in Virginia , Pocahontas was a girl of eleven or so . The real Pocahontas was a child of privilege in her society  --  that is , the Powhatan Empire  --  who was curious about the English newcomers , befriended Smith , and gave him and the rest of the English crucial assistance . Years later , looking back on her contributions , Smith would recall that her " compassionate pitiful pitying heart . . . gave me much cause to respect her . " He credited her with saving the colony . The English in Virginia , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Smith left the colony , they kidnapped her and held her hostage for ransom from her father , Chief Powhatan . Yet during that time , she came to embrace English ways , married a thoroughly lovestruck Englishman named John Rolfe , and lived out the rest of her short life in his country . // Smith , at the other end of the social scale , was born in 1580 in rustic Willoughby by Alford , Lincolnshire , to a simple farm family , putting him just one rung above peasanthood . Soldiering was to be his ticket out . He was of slightly below-average height , even by the standards of his time , measuring in at perhaps five-foot-three or five-foot-four , but he was stocky and tough . He had dark hair and a full beard , and eyes that showed intelligence and confidence . In a portrait made later in his life , Smith meets the onlooker ? s gaze with neither haughtiness nor servility , but instead with unassuming equality  --  an unusual attitude in his class-conscious homeland . " He was honest , sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a century and a half later . // The young John Smith attended grammar school in nearby Louth while dreaming of overseas adventure ; at the age of thirteen , no longer content with fantasizing , he tried to run away from home in hopes of making his way abroad . His father , George Smith , had other ideas and succeeded in stopping him . At fifteen , bowing unhappily to his father ? s wishes , John Smith became an apprentice to a merchant . A year or two later , however , in a bittersweet turn of events for the young man , the path to the sea became open : Smith ? s father died . // This time , there was no one to stand in John Smith ? s way . Bored with counting his master ? s money , Smith headed to the Continent and fought under a Captain Joseph Duxbury in the Netherlands , aiding that country in its war of independence against Spain . Life on the battlefield agreed with him . Returning to England a few years later , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little woody pasture , " as he called it , to make a single-minded study of all things martial . He was twenty years old . // In that pasture , Smith showed the first signs of what would become his lifelong preoccupation with practical knowledge . He practiced horsemanship . He read Machiavelli ? s The Art of War . He learned the life story of Marcus Aurelius , the Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher ( and patriarch of the 2000 film Gladiator ) . Smith became an explosives expert , with the aid of a translated copy of Vannoccio Biringuccio ? s Pirotechnia . He memorized codes for sending signals over distances using torchlight . Although some of his study seems more on the side of erudition than practicality , Smith would have seen no bright line between the two : history , biography , and munitions were all pragmatic subjects that a military man needed to operate effectively in the world . // Smith was ready to embark on his chosen profession . He made his way back to the Continent . In the summer of 1601 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupying armies of the Turkish Ottoman Empire , the Muslim superpower that had conquered much of Central Europe , North Africa , and the Middle East . In Hungary , Smith deployed his signaling torches , his explosives ( he called them his " fiery dragons " ) , and other devices and strategems to lethal effect , earning himself the title of captain . Here he experienced a taste of meritocracy : with individual excellence and contribution came respect and advancement . It made its impression on the young soldier . // His fortunes took a decided turn for the worse on a cold winter ? s day in 1602 , when he was captured on the battlefield in present-day Romania . He was taken to an auction with others to be sold into slavery  --  " like beasts in a market-place , " he recalled . Smith ended up on a Turkish farm under a cruel master , where his head was shaved bare and a ring of iron placed around his neck . He found he was joining hundreds of slaves  --  European , Turk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was all he needed to hear . He was laboring in the fields one day when the master came by on horseback to beat him ; seizing his chance , Smith turned the tables , beating the man to death with a threshing bat . Smith then put on the dead man ? s clothes and took off on his horse for friendly territory . // Smith wrangled a place in the Virginia expedition several years afterward . The historical record doesn ? t reveal why he was picked . The leadership of the Virginia Company probably saw him simply as a hired military hand in case of an attack from the Spanish or trouble with the natives . If so , he proved to be larger than that role . No matter how or why he got the job , it seems obvious in retrospect that he was unusually well suited to become the colony ? s leader , as he ultimately did . His adventures in Hungary gave him the experience of dealing with foreigners both as comrades and as adversaries . Those years also shaped his distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dangerous enemy , and in which people were to be judged by their effectiveness rather than by their bloodlines. // Hence , unlike most Englishmen of his day , Smith believed it was important to understand and deal with the natives as they actually were , not as symbols of primitive evil or virtue . Accordingly , he studied the Powhatan language and culture closely , and indeed , he left behind our most detailed ethnographic writings on those people . With the benefit of that information , he was able to keep Chief Powhatan at bay through a mix of diplomacy and intimidation  --  not through massacre  --  at a time when the Powhatan Empire outnumbered the English by well over a hundred to one . It was this record that led several of Smith ? s admirers among the colonists to write later , with only slight exaggeration , that " thou Virginia foild ? st , yet kep ? st unstained "  --  that is , he foiled the natives in Virginia , but didn ? t stain Virginia with their blood . // At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own countrymen into shape , particularly " the better sort " ( as gentlemen were often called ) . They " exclaim of all things , though they never adventured to know any thing , " Smith groused , " nor ever did anything but devour the fruits of other men ? s labors . " The gallants , he added with a sneer , were discontented because they didn ? t have " any of their accustomed dainties , with feather beds and down pillows , taverns and alehouses in every breathing place , neither plenty of gold and silver and dissolute liberty as they expected . " Once they were truly under Smith ? s thumb , as he moved from serving as a council member to colony president , he gave the " better sort " reason to squirm with his decree that " he that will not work shall not eat . " // All that was to come later . As the three ships sat at anchor in late 1606 , there was little reason to assume that the mission would succeed . The crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorer Sebastian Cabot almost a century earlier . The ships could go down in bad weather , as Sir Humphrey Gilbert ? s did during a 1583 attempt at colonizing . And , of course , the colony could establish itself and then fail for any number of reasons , like the Roanoke settlements of 1585 and 1587. // Those expeditions , organized by Sir Walter Ralegh , sent colonists to Roanoke Island off present-day North Carolina . Ralegh  --  or Raleigh , or Rawleyghe  --  became famous to succeeding generations for an alleged episode of chivalry involving Queen Elizabeth and a mud puddle . ( Ralegh supposedly took off his best cloak and laid it over the puddle for the queen to step over . ) In his own time , Ralegh was better known as an accomplished mariner and poet and as a handsome object of the queen ? s affection . Like Humphrey Gilbert , his half brother , he was also known for his enthusiastic butchery of the Irish as an officer in that country , not sparing women or children . // After he received encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent off his first colonizing expedition from England in April 1585 ; it left 107 men at Roanoke that summer . Ralph Lane , one of their leaders , was awestruck by , as he wrote , the " huge and unknowen greatnesse " of the continent . Things went awry early on ; the colony lost most of its food supply when its supply ship , the Tiger , struck ground during a storm ; salt water flowed in and spoiled the provisions . That meant the settlers would have to live off the land  --  or freeload off the natives . Lane opted for the latter , using the threat of force when charity wasn ? t forthcoming . ( Perhaps fortunately for the natives of Roanoke Island , Ralegh himself never set foot in the New World . ) After putting up with the English through the winter , the natives began starving them out . In June , after months of desperation , the colonists were rescued by Sir Francis Drake and taken back home . // The next attempt took a different and less militaristic tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , and children under the rule of a painter , John White . Two of the women , including White ? s daughter , were pregnant and soon gave birth to the first English children to be born in the New World . A month after the settlers arrived at Roanoke , White headed back to England for supplies . War between England and Spain kept White from returning until 1590 . When he did , he found that the settlers  --  including his daughter and granddaughter  --  had disappeared without a trace . There were no bodies or any other signs of a struggle . The only clues were a tree carved with the letters " CRO " and a post carved with the word " CROATOAN. &amp; //
