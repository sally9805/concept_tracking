Metro Girl LP Chapter One Just because I know how to change a guy 's oil does n't mean I want to spend the rest of my life on my back , staring up his undercarriage . Been there , done that . Okay , so my dad owns a garage . And okay , I have a natural aptitude for rebuilding carburetors . There comes a time in a girl 's life when she needs to trade in her mechanic 's overalls for a pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos . Not that I can afford a lot of Manolos , but it 's a goal , right ? My name is Alexandra Barnaby , and I worked in my dad 's garage in the Canton section of Baltimore all through high school and during summer breaks when I was in college . It 's not a big fancy garage , but it holds its own , and my dad has a reputation for being an honest mechanic . When I was twelve my dad taught me how to use an acetylene torch . After I mastered welding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn mower , and I built myself a go-cart . When I was sixteen , I started rebuilding a ten-year-old junker Chevy . I turned it into a fast car . And I raced it in the local stocks for two years . " And here she comes , folks , " the announcer would say . " Barney Barnaby . Number sixteen , the terror of Baltimore County . She 's coming up on the eight car . She 's going to the inside . Wait a minute , I see flames coming from sixteen . There 's a lot of smoke now . Looks like she 's blown another engine . Good thing she works in her dad 's garage . " So I could build cars , and I could drive cars . I just never got the hang of driving them without destroying them . " Barney , " my dad would say . " I swear you blow those engines just so you can rebuild them . " Maybe on an unconscious level . The brain is a pretty weird thing . What I knew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I lost more races than I won . So , I raced two seasons and packed it in . My younger brother , Wild Bill , drove , too . He never cared if he won or lost . He just liked to drive fast and scratch his balls with the rest of the guys . Bill was voted Most Popular of his senior class and also Least Likely to Succeed . The class 's expectation for Bill 's success was a reflection of Bill 's philosophy of life . If work was any fun , it would be called play . I 've always been the serious kid , and Bill 's always been the kid who knew how to have a good time . Two years ago , Bill said good-bye Baltimore and hello Miami . He liked the lazy hot sun , the open water , and the girls in bikinis . Two days ago , Bill disappeared off the face of the earth . And he did it while I was talking to him . He woke me up with a phone call in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the phone line . " I have to leave Miami for a while . Tell Mom I 'm okay . " I squinted at my bedside clock . Two AM . Not late for Bill who spent a lot of time in South Beach bars . Real late for me who worked nine to five and went to bed at ten . " What 's that noise ? " I asked him . " I can hardly hear you . " " Boat engine . Listen , I do n't want you to worry if you do n't hear from me . And if some guys show up looking for me , do n't tell them anything . Unless it 's Sam Hooker . Tell Sam Hooker he can kiss my exhaust pipe . " " Guys ? What guys ? And what do you mean , do n't tell them anything ? " " I have to go . I have to ... oh shit . " I heard a woman scream in the background , and the line went dead . Baltimore is cold in January . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side streets , citywide . We get a couple snowstorms each year and some freezing rain , but mostly we get bone-chilling gray gloom . In the midst of the gray gloom , pots of chili bubble on stoves , beer flows like water , sausages are stuffed into hard rolls , and doughnuts are a necessity to survival . Miami , it turns out , is hot in January . I 'd taken the midday flight out of BWI , arriving in Miami midafternoon . When I left home I was wrapped in a quilted down-filled coat , cashmere Burberry scarf , fleece-lined boots , and heavy-duty shearling mittens . Perfect for Baltimore . Not great for Miami . On arrival , I 'd crammed the scarf and mittens into the mediumsize duffel bag that hung from my shoulder , wrapped my coat around the duffel bag handle , and went in search of the taxi stand . Sweat was soaking into my Victoria 's Secret Miracle Bra , my hair was plastered to my forehead , and I was sucking in air that felt like hot soup . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build . I 'm not movie-star gorgeous , but I 'm okay . My hair is naturally mousy brown , but I started bleaching it blond when I decided to stop being a grease monkey . It 's currently platinum and cut in a medium-length shaggy kind of style that I can punk up with paste if the occasion arises . I have blue eyes , a mouth that 's a little too big for my face , and a perfect nose inherited from my Grandma Jean . My parents took Bill and me to Disney World when I was nine . That 's the extent of my in-the-flesh Florida experience . The rest of my Florida knowledge consists mainly of horrific bug stories from my mom 's friend Elsie Duchen . Elsie winters in Ocala with her daughter . Elsie swears there are cockroaches as big as cows in Florida . And she says they can fly . I 'm here to tell you , if I see a cow-size cockroach fly by , I 'm gone ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
