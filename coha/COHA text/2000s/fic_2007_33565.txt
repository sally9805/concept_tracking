I can remember the first Christmas after my father left . I was five . We did n't get a tree that year . We did n't buy gifts . Somehow it seemed pathetic to deck the halls and all-when Dad was n't there . We missed opportunities . And I got really good at missing opportunities . I am Emily . Emily Rhode . When I was in second grade , I experimented with changing my identity by misspelling my last name . I had hopes that a new spelling might transform me and permit me access to a new home , and a new life . Sometimes it was Road . Or Rowed , and even Rode . Almost no one ever noticed the way my name was spelled . People just assume you 're going to get your own name right . Except for Miss Bryan , my English teacher . She seemed curious . Or , at the very least , not comatose . She gave us an assignment . " Write one paragraph about your home , " said Miss Bryan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I tell her the combination to the safe , too ? I was eager to share , the perfect accomplice , and I did n't need more than one sentence . The sentence is as true today as it was twenty years ago : Home is a place you can never leave behind . I liked that it was both insistent and ambiguous . I spelled my name correctly , because spelling counts . Whileyou ca n't leave it behind , you can look at the events of your past from a new point of view . Turn them around . See all the angles . Consider it your second chance . Second chances do come your way . Like trains , they arrive and depart regularly . Recognizing the ones that matter is the trick . My office chair is parked behind a small desk , and on the desk is a giant phone . I intentionally use the word parked because the chair is enormous and-if you believe the old wives ' tales-engineered by the Ford Motor Company . In front of my desk is an impressive wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll miss about this crappy job when I leave . I 've been able to work in confidence knowing that if someone tries to shoot me-the fabulously sultry gal who answers the telephone-the bullets will bounce mockingly off of the Plexiglas and not disturb me from the important business of answering the telephone . When the phone does n't ring for a while , I start to think about bringing in my own gun and taking a couple of shots at the Plexiglas to test it . Sure the manufacturer says it 's bulletproof . I do n't own a piece though , and when I call a shooting range somewhere in Millbrook , New York , they tell me not to call again . Ever . They refused to answer my question . How much will it cost to hire a guy to take a couple of shots at a piece of Plexiglas in a Midtown high-rise ? It is n't their line of work , they claim . " Yeah , but bottom line it for me , sister . Send a body out to gim me an estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're crazy , lady , " they say , and hang up . I 'm just killing time and hoping they 'll play along , and I 'm disappointed when they refuse . For a moment I worry that I work for one of those companies that monitors its phone calls under the guise of quality control . I am instantly comforted when I realize I work for a law firm too disorganized to tap its own phones . To say all I do is answer phones is to seriously downplay my role around here . I also control the buzzer button that opens the main door , allowing lawyers into their offices after they get off of the elevator , or return from the bathroom . Sometimes I fail to push the buzzer with the deftness they might like . I eat up a second of this person 's life , five seconds of that person 's life . The ones who grow impatient quickly and who are easily angered are the ones I steal twenty seconds from for the sheer pleasure of it . They grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel terrific , alive in that way that you do n't feel often enough . I daydream-and get paid for it . I recall a scene from An Officer and a Gentleman . At the end of the movie Richard Gere , dressed in his naval whites , goes into a factory , picks up Debra Winger , and carries her out of that depressing place with all of those dirty machines . I wish that would happen to me . Of course the whole time I 'd be worried that the guy was trying to guess my weight or something . I realize how truly pathetic I am . Some guy in a uniform drags his woman out of the workplace to stick her in a house to cook and possibly even clip coupons , and I am starting to buy into it , into the antifemale propaganda disguised as romance . As soon as he picks her up , things have to head south from there , because at some point , he has to put her down . I blame my father for my current situation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and actually work through it . Instead , I pin all of my disappointment and loss on my current post . I ca n't decide what 's worse , clock-watching or minimum wage . Luckily , I 'm steeped in both , so I do n't have to choose . The world of nepotism is ugly and dark . I know . There are people out there paying their dues who probably deserve to sit behind this Plexiglas more than I do . If not for the fact that my father is so well connected , I 'd be forced to do a job I got solely on merit . I 'd be working as a lawyer , on track to make partner , at a firm where a senior partner was not 50 percent responsible for creating me . I would be boosting my rsum and sleeping with young enthusiasts of all things legal . The notion of being shot would , in all likelihood , not even occur to me . It certainly would n't preoccupy me . I may be the only professional in history to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections . "
