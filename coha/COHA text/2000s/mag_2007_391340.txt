Title IX has , among other things , helped girls ace math , take " shop " and stop sexual harassers EVERY TIME A GIRL FIXES AN ENGINE IN AUTO shop , bubbles in her answers on a less-biased SAT , or successfully files a complaint to stop sexual harassment , she has Title LX to thank . " Before Tide IX , if you were discriminated against , all you could do is maybe transfer to another school-if they 'd let you , " says Bernice Sandier , the woman considered the " godmother " of the law . " Title IX allowed students to say , " This is not only wrong ; this is illegal . ' ' " And a lot was wrong . Before Tide LX , stereotypes about boys ' and girls ' interests and abilities determined which classes they were allowed to take in middle and high school and , more subdy , how they were counseled . Girls were barred from wood- and auto-shop classes and instead shunted into home economics . Counselors often advised girls not to take advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for traditionally " female " careers . Pregnant young women were forced to drop out of school , and pregnant teachers were forced to quit once they began to " show . " But with the passage of Tide LX something could be done about it , and today , girls spend their childhood in **32;4503;TOOLONG classrooms and schools that are more equitable and more supportive of their dreams . Here are some of the advances that can be attributed , in part , to the 1972 law : GIRLS ' PARTICIPATION AND ACHIEVEMENT IN MATH AND SCIENCE HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY . In the pre-Title IX era , math- and science-minded girls often faced discouragement from peers , teachers and counselors . " You knew that you were doing something that was deviant , " says Shirley Malcolm , head of the directorate for education and human resources programs of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . " You 'd go into math and science classes , especially at the levels where they became elective , and you were one of only a handful of young women . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college preparatory curriculum in math and science , compared with twice as many boys . Yet by 1994 , girls were earning more credits in high school math and science than boys and as early as 1990 , their GPAs in these subjects surpassed boys ' ' . Additionally , the gender gap between boys and girls on the national high school math and science achievement tests has decreased significantly : In 1973 the gap in science favored boys by 16 points ; today it is 4 . Likewise , the gap on the math test has shrunk from 8 to 2 points . DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GIRLS AND TEACHERS WHO BECOME PREGNANT HAS DECREASED . " Before Title IX , if girls got pregnant they were literally kicked out of most schools , " says Sandler . " Very often people knew who the father was ... but he did n't receive any punishment at all . " Women teachers also faced tough consequences for getting pregnant , routinely losing their jobs when they began to show . Thanks to Tide DC , today pregnant women are legally protected from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academically challenging programs for teen mothers . ALL VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND CLASSES HAVE BEEN OPENED TO BOTH SEXES . Gone are the days of separate pink and blue forms for vocational aptitude tests ; now girls are just as free to saw wood in carpentry as boys are to cut hair in cosmetology . But sex segregation in vocational education is still great , probably due to remaining stigmas about what is considered appropriate work for men and women . In 2005 , girls still comprised 87 percent of those enrolled in traditionally girls ' vocational classes but only 15 percent of those in traditionally boys ' classes , according to the National Women 's Law Center . This puts girls at a disadvantage , since jobs traditionally limited to women pay much less than " men 's " jobs . WOMEN EDUCATORS NOW EARN MORE , RANK HIGHER . Since 1973 , salaries for women teachers have increased from 84 percent of men 's earnings to 90 percent in 2006 . Today schools are more than three times as likely to be led by women principals as they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by women , and the percentage of women school-district and state superintendents has also increased substantially . SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN SCHOOLS IS NOW CLEARLY ILLEGAL . In the 1980s and 1990s , the U.S. Supreme Court issued rulings clarifying that the definition of sex discrimination under Tide IX includes sexual harassment by peers or school employees . Before that , victims of sexual harassment in schools-including boys-had no clearly established way to seek justice or financial settlements . " Title IX allows you to hold the school accountable , " says Lisalyn Jacobs of Legal Momentum ( formerly the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund ) . THE PSAT AND SAT HAVE BECOME LESS BIASED AGAINST GIRLS . These standardized tests , which serve as qualifying exams for scholarships and college admissions , have long underestimated the ability of girls . Their creator , Educational Testing Services ( ETS ) , has claimed they predict first-year college grades , yet girls-who have traditionally scored lower on the tests-get better freshman grades . As a result of a Tide IX settlement , ETS added a writing section to the PSAT in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them millions more in test-score-based scholarship money . In 2005 , ETS also added a writing section to the SAT , and by 2007 the gender gap favoring boys had decreased from 42 to 25 points . Despite all these advances , Tide IX has yet to be used to its full potential in K-12 education . Government enforcement and gender-equity assistance programs for elementary and secondary education have greatly decreased in recent years . Many students and parents do n't know that Tide IX can be applied in cases outside athletics , and therefore are not aware of their rights . And schools rarely appoint requisite Tide IX coordinators or put in place grievance procedures-until after they face legal trouble . Nonetheless , in the last 35 years , Tide IX has successfully changed the lives of girls and of women educators by protecting their rights , broadening their horizons and setting them up for success in later stages of their education and careers .
