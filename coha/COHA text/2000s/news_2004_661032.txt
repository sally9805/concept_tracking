<p> David Halberstam <p> Pulitzer-Prize winning author and social and political commentator <p> Skidmore College , Saratoga Springs , N.Y . <p> For those of you who have not prospered academically , let me give you a bit of good news - you are being addressed by someone who was in the bottom half of his class at Harvard . Or , in fact , if you want to be a didactic about it , the bottom third of his class . So there is life after college ; I 'm proof of it . <p> Let me jump ahead to the mandatory part of the speech - words of direction from the old to the young - the requisite geezer wisdom . <p> Other than the choice of a lifetime partner , nothing determines happiness so much as choosing the right kind of work . It is a choice about what is good for you , not what is good for others whom you greatly respect - your parents , an admired professor , a significant other . The choice is not about what makes them happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings you the biggest salary and the biggest house or the greatest respect from Wall Street , but what makes you feel complete and happy and makes you feel , for this is no small thing , like a part of something larger than yourself , a part of a community . <p> Do not be afraid to take chances when you are young , to choose the unconventional over the conventional . Often it is experience in the unconventional which prepares you best for the conventional . Be aware that it 's all right to make mistakes , and it is all right to try at something and fail . <p> Nancy Pelosi <p> House minority leader , highest-ranking woman in the history of the United States Congress <p> Simmons College , Boston <p> I sit at the table of power with the President of the United States and top leaders of Congress . At that table , national security , the economy , and other vital national issues are discussed . And I am astounded that in more than 200 years in our nation 's history , no women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to change that . <p> I can tell you from firsthand experience that any discussion of the most serious issues facing our country is enhanced by diversity at the table - diversity of gender and ethnic diversity . The more the tables of power reflect the beautiful diversity of our country , the more their policies will reflect the aspirations of all the American people . We need more women leaders in government because it takes the full spectrum of human talent to administer our complex society . Men and women each possess distinctive gifts and insights . What is that difference ? It 's that special strength that comes to us because women must deal with complexity , day by day in our own lives and , increasingly , in public life as well . <p> Not only are we changing the world , but we also bring with us the best of our identities . We bring family . We bring compassion . We bring sensitivity and care . And we bring our communities . Because women are loyal to their communities , our communities are turning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director , and activist <p> Bard College , Annandale-on-Hudson , N.Y . <p> When I started the Sundance Film Festival , I was advised against it . I was told nobody 's going to come . Who cares about independent film , it 's a subject that 's DOA and I said I just want to do it . So we did ... and no one came . And then I said we 're going to do something to draw attention to it , we 're going to put it in the winter , we 're going to put it up in the mountains . And they said , " Sure , Bob , good , enjoy your lonely time up there . " And I did , for a while . There I was standing out there with a staff pulling people in off the streets to go see the movie and they said , " I will if you sit in there with me ! " So it was a hard time and yes , I 'm happy to say , it 's gone to new and better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something new , there is going to be a struggle and you have to have a lot of passion behind it . <p> And I had discovered already by that time , obviously , that art in my life was important , because in addition to my own soul 's vocation , it was going to represent the most accessible path that I could find to independence and the spirit of independent thinking . <p> I feel really strongly right now that we are in such an important time . Yes , it 's dangerous , but it 's also a time of enormous promise and it 's going to be put to you . Do n't be hindered in times that can be full of angst , confusion , and chaos . And considering what this country can instill and present to you , you can shape and play your role in your very own future . It is a wonderful , beautiful country - still capable , still capable , despite what 's been going on lately , of reaching its potential to itself and the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy and freedom . <p> John McCain <p> US Senator ( R ) of Arizona Former naval aviator and POW <p> University of Southern California , Los Angeles <p> You might think that I 'm now going to advise you not to be afraid to fail . I 'm not . Be afraid . Speaking from considerable experience , failing stinks . Just do n't be undone by it . Move on . Failure is no more a permanent condition than is success . " Defeat is never fatal , " Winston Churchill observed . " Victory is never final . It 's courage that counts . " <p> I 'm sure you 're all aware of the inspiring story of Pat Tillman , who gave up a successful professional football career to enlist in the Army after September 11th . He served one combat tour in Iraq , and then another in Afghanistan , where he was killed in action . He was a good son , brother , husband , and friend ; an excellent student , an overachieving athlete . Few of us will have occasion to need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we serve in the military to need or prove real courage . We all need and can possess moral courage . <p> We must , as Eleanor Roosevelt - a woman plagued by feelings of insecurity - put it , " do the thing you think you can not do , " and " you gain strength , courage and confidence by every experience . " <p> If you do the things you think you can not do , you 'll feel your resistance , your hope , your dignity and your courage grow stronger every time you prove it . <p> Bill Cosby <p> Actor , comedian <p> Wilkes University , Wilkes-Barre , Pa . <p> It was n't such a good idea to have the four 4.0 people up here and then announce all of the other things they are doing besides studying , because when you are a 2.2 , you do n't have an excuse anymore . When you hear that a 4.0 was doing about nine other things with the community and flying over on weekends to work for Mother Teresa and you are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a full campus life . I do n't want to be a person in the books all day studying . " Well those 4.0s do n't appear to have done that . As a matter of fact , they had more fun than you had . <p> All you 2.2s that applauded when you heard 2.2 , first thing you need to do is get a paper and pencil and apologize to every professor you ever turned in a paper late to or you tried to argue for a C for the D you got . <p> I know , these people around you now , they 'll support you . Just remember one thing - if you 're going back home , you 're going back to live with them and the car you have , they bought . And the money that went to this education , they paid for . The credit cards you were given and you maxed out , they bailed you out . You 're going to pick up your degree here , but those of you who are going back home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that 20 years from now , someone coming to get an honorary degree will not necessarily be the 4.0 person that was honored today . It may be a 2.2 , so that means you have a chance . Do n't stay your mother 's son too long . <p> This is family day here . They brought children to see this . Think about that . You were today 's entertainment and what did you do ? You sat out there and then you walked across here and they brought little babies to see this . You must be special ; I do n't understand it . Nobody should be here because they are all broke . What they should show up for is the day you go to work . <p> Jon Stewart <p> Host of ' The Daily Show ' on Comedy Central <p> The College of William &; Mary , Williamsburg , Va . ( Class of 1983 ) <p> When I left William and Mary , I was shell-shocked . Because when you 're in college , it 's very clear what you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to get to this college and to graduate from it . But the unfortunate , yet truly exciting thing about your life is that there is no core curriculum . The entire place is an elective . The paths are infinite and the results uncertain . And it can be maddening to those that go here , because your strength has always been achievement . So if there 's any real advice I can give you , it 's this . <p> College is something you complete . Life is something you experience . So do n't worry about your grade or the results or success . Success is defined in myriad ways , and you will find it , and people will no longer be grading you , but it will come from your own internal sense of decency which I imagine , after going through the program here , is quite strong . Although I 'm sure downloading illegal files ... but , nah , that 's a different story . Love what you do . Get good at it . Competence is a rare commodity in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may . <p> And the last thing I want to address is the idea that somehow this new generation is not as prepared for the sacrifice and the tenacity that will be needed in the difficult times ahead . I have not found this generation to be cynical or apathetic or selfish . They are as strong and as decent as any people that I have met . <p> Condoleezza Rice <p> National Security Adviser <p> Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tenn . <p> If you look closely around you at the crowd of faces , it 's a very different crowd than you would have seen even 50 years ago . Represented among us today are students and faculty of both genders , all races , numerous ethnicities , every major religion , and many different nationalities . <p> I grew up in Birmingham , Ala. , before the civil rights movement - a place that was once described , with no exaggeration , as the most thoroughly segregated city in the country . I know what it means to hold dreams and aspirations when half your neighbors think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> With all that you have learned and all that you 've been given , you have no excuse to be pessimists . You should know that progress is not only possible , but an unfolding story in which you have an obligation to play a part . <p> Second , you have an obligation to work to close the cultural gaps that divide our nation and our world . The intellectual foundation of terrorism , like the intellectual foundation of slavery and segregation , rests on arbitrarily dividing human beings into friends and enemies , even into human and nonhuman . The perpetrators of September 11th were people who believed that difference was a license to kill . Because the education you have had has privileged you to be with those who are unlike you , you know better than most that difference is not a source of fear but an opportunity to learn . <p> Your third obligation is to work to further the same democratic progress here and abroad that has made your own opportunities possible . All people are bound together by several common desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not share your desire to live freely - to think and believe as you would like to see fit , to raise a family and educate children , boys and girls . <p> The need for idealists eager to do the hard , yet necessary , work of furthering peace and justice and democracy has never been greater , but neither has the opportunity to do good and change the world . With all of the images of troops and tanks and military operations , it 's hard to remember that this is primarily a war of ideas , not armies . It will be won by visionaries who can look past the moment to see a world in which freedom is not only the birthright of all but a reality for all and who will work to make that day come true . <p> Roll up your sleeves . And let the work begin . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
