<p> In the June 24 Faith &; Values , we asked people to share their thoughts on the afterlife . Dozens of readers responded . Here is a selection , representing a wide range of views . <p> Heaven is not a place any more than love itself can be a place . " The kingdom of God is within you , " said Jesus . As our deepest thoughts and feelings become more good and Christlike , so will we experience this " Kingdom of God , " or heaven , here and hereafter . <p> DAVID HOLMES , Marietta <p> I 'm quite certain my " afterlife " will be what it will be . I am far more concerned with how I live my life while I have it . If I am conscious of spiritual principles and live in accordance with them , then there 's not much else I can do , nor more important . I do n't believe that simply pronouncing my acceptance of certain concepts or dogma is enough , nor the ultimate prerequisite for whatever good may occur following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The spirit within me is his constant truth . It never dies . <p> Bodily desires are the challenge . <p> When my body dies , the spirit will be freed to an eternity of total joy or perhaps its total absence  --  a choice determined by my earthly pursuit of the truth vs. temporal enticements . <p> JIM McERLEAN , Loganville <p> God is not in the sky watching my every move . God is a spirit that dwells in every living thing and most importantly in the human heart . The only eternity I will know is where my ashes end up . But hopefully I will experience a balance between heaven and hell while I am here on earth . And if I play my cards right , I will continue to live in the hearts of those who know me and love me . <p> MERLE EVANS , Doraville <p> Heaven is existing without pain , fear or any other condition that torments humankind . Hell is existence where these conditions exist . <p> Since these conditions are subjectively determined by processes in the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end with death . <p> Existence beyond this point is not known and not provable . <p> WADE HUMPHREYS , Valdosta <p> As a Baha'i , I believe that this world is our classroom . Whatever spiritual values we learn in this physical life we take with us to the next world  --  to be close to God 's light ( heaven ) , or away ( hell ) , like a series of stairs . It does not matter your road to God ( your religion ) . <p> RHONDA NIAGER , Lilburn <p> My faith teaches me that if I love God with my heart , soul and mind and my neighbor as myself , I will gain eternal life in the presence of God . If I work all my life to follow these two great commandments , I need not be that concerned about " that great gettin ' up mornin ' . " <p> BEATRICE PERRY STANLEY , East Point <p> Since God is just , of course I am concerned about what will happen in the next world . Life is a test . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we are assigned to heaven or hell , where we live to eternity . Hope I make the cut . <p> JAMES PERRY , Dacula <p> At age 6 , watching my mother grieve for my father and sister at graveside , an aunt whispered to me : " They 're not here , but happy with God in heaven . We 'll all be together again . That 's where we go when we die . " I 've never doubted it a minute in 65 years . <p> VAUGHN L. PUSEY , Duluth <p> Since death is not an object , I have no fear of it . I would n't know what I was afraid of . I am concerned about the living of this life . <p> BURDETT WANTLAND , Newnan <p> When we pass out of our physical body , we will be greeted by some of our loved ones . The souls around us will be of the same feelings we have had for others . There is a sort of hell if you were evil , or a heaven if you gave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> HARRIET WOODYARD , Jefferson <p> The Bible 's words are specific regarding heaven and hell . If one believes in Jesus as one 's personal savior , one can believe he will " prepare a place " for each of us , as he said . Trust him to make it the perfect place . <p> JENNIFER ROBERTS , LaGrange <p> It should be obvious to any thinking person that there is no consciousness , and therefore no thoughts or emotions , after death . Rather than be concerned about an afterlife , I think it would be far better to make life a " heaven " for others here on earth . Caring for others is a noble goal and is worthy of our concern and diligent effort ! This life is the only chance we have to make the world a better place . As Doc told Marty in the movie " Back to the Future , " " The future is in your hands . So make it a good one ! " <p> STEVE YOTHMENT , Atlanta <p> Fundamentalist Christian theology about heaven and hell must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An omniscient God would know in advance that evil would be part of his creation , even though evil would be the result of rebellious angels with free will , and therefore would know that people would sin and be condemned to hell . Why bother with creation to only condemn the majority to eternal pain ? Only a God obsessed with his own sadistic entertainment would do such a thing . <p> THEIRN SCOTT , Lawrenceville <p> I believe in God , who created time and space , but exists outside both . He ( she ) relates personally to us created beings . Since I am embraced in this relationship with God , it is heaven now , and after this earthly life , will be heaven in another realm . The antithesis of this reality ( no relationship ) is hell . <p> RICHARD B. STEWART , Doraville <p> Heaven and hell are both very real places . I am going to heaven ! Why ? Because I have been born again by God 's Holy Spirit . In the Book of John , Chapter 3 , verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new birth , you are heaven bound . <p> JERRY HOOD , Young Harris <p> I believe in a literal heaven and hell . Christ taught that there was in fact a place of eternal torment and a place of " many mansions " in heaven . Satan wants us to put off the most important decision of our lives  --  accepting Christ  --  by telling us that it is all just a state of mind  --  not real . Otherwise , we would have to face our own sin and make a decision . <p> LINDA BLILE , Jonesboro <p> Where am I going ? I have been saved by the blood of the lamb and proudly acknowledge Jesus Christ as my lord and savior . Therefore , there is no doubt in my mind that I will someday see God 's face and live in glory forever with my father in heaven , as he has promised . Amen ! ! <p> DEE BUNT , Canton <p> The risen Jesus Christ offered everyone heaven . Repentance toward God and faith in Jesus is required . Eye has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heart what Jesus has prepared for the " whosoever wills . " You must be born again . <p> JESSE CLEMENTS , Cedartown <p> The concept of the " immortal soul " and " going to heaven " or " going to hell " after death are not to be found in the sacred book of Christianity  --  the Bible . These , in fact , are pagan concepts incorporated into Christianity as it was forced on the Roman Empire by Constantine . Most of the modern concepts of hell are inspired more by Dante than the Holy Scripture . <p> The Bible teaches that , without God , we die and suffer the same fate as all the other animals on the earth . That Jesus will return to this earth and that those of his followers who remain faithful will be resurrected as immortal spirit beings but also that all others who have lived will be resurrected as mortal human beings . After some time , they will experience judgment and then either be destroyed or become spirit beings on the " new heaven and new earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you will not surely die " and fabricates eternal life even for those who are defective ( those who refuse to follow God 's ways ) . <p> CLAY WILLIS , Acworth <p> Heaven and hell as we relate to them are expressed as sensory perceptions like hot , hungry , painful , etc . We give up our sensory system along with our body upon death . The traditional concept of heaven and hell is , therefore , untenable after life . We should not allow any religion to play upon our fears by inserting manipulative superstitions . <p> The statement by T.S . Eliot that " Hell is a place where people feel disconnected from each other " is the real practical message . <p> BHAGIRATH MAJMUDAR , Atlanta <p> We have a soul that has many lives before we return to God . The earth is a bridge where we have infinite opportunities to perfect our souls . <p> There is no damnation , as God is love . Since God is in all creation , how well we love now is our concern . The afterlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven and hell are both temporary destinations where the so-called individual soul goes to either enjoy or suffer the results of their good and bad actions . After their tour of duty , the individual soul will be reborn again and again until it longs for liberation . At the proper time , the soul will be introduced to a grace-bestowing master who offers a path to liberation that the individual will either follow with right effort or not . <p> H. HOLLAND , Atlanta <p> There is no heaven , and no hell . The concepts were added to the fictional book that Christians base their faith on . Hell is meant to guilt people into being " good , " while heaven is there because people have to be told there is some sort of happy ending to it all . <p> JIMI SPETTEL , Warner Robins <p> First we must start with the soul . Every human being has a soul , and it can not be destroyed . <p> If you are a born-again Christian ( a believer ) , regardless of denomination , at the Rapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to the now existing heaven . Those that have died and were buried , if they are believers , will also rise first and be in this group of the saved . <p> The nonbelievers that were buried will not rise , but remain buried another 1,000 years . Of course , all of the nonbelievers will be " left behind . " <p> After this period , the believers will be carried to a place called " The Holy City , The New Jerusalem " to spend eternity . The Holy City replaces the old earth and the old heaven , for they have passed away . <p> VERLIN KING , Stone Mountain <p> ON AJC.COM <p> * Do you worry about the afterlife , or wonder what happens when you die ? Join the blog at ajc.com . <p> SOME FAMOUS FOLKS ' VIEWS ON AFTERLIFE <p> Throughout the history of man , most cultures have promoted some belief in the afterlife  --  the thought that the soul or center of consciousness survives physical death . <p> Does the soul exist in some otherworldly condition of peace or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evolution , attempting to obtain perfection ? <p> Or , as some people believe , are human beings no more than particles ? <p> Here is a selection of quotations about immortality from " The Treasury of Religious and Spiritual Quotations " : <p> " The body dies , but the spirit is not entombed . " <p> THE DHAMMAPADA , circa 5th century B.C. <p> " Only faith in a life after death in a brighter world where dear ones will meet again  --  only that and the measured tramp of time can give consolation .
