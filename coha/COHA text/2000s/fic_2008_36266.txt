The house was yellow , a clapboard Cape Cod with a white picket fence and a big bay window on one side , and Ellen loved it with all her heart . She loved the way the wind from the Gorge stirred the trees to constant motion outside the windows , the cozy are of the dormers in the girls ' bedroom , the cherry red mantel with the cleanly carved dentil molding over the fireplace in the living room . She had conceived children in that house , suffered a miscarriage in that house , brought her babies home there , argued with her husband there , made love , rejoiced , despaired , sipped tea , and gossiped and sobbed and counseled and blessed her friends there , walked the halls with sick children there , and scrubbed the worn brick of the kitchen floor there at least a thousand times on her hands and knees . And it was because of all this history with the house , all the parts of her life unfolding there day after day for so many years , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought she would n't have to . While she had known at every step that moving was a mistake , she could almost picture someone else in the house , perhaps a nice retired couple who would stay a few years before moving on , or a quiet bachelor who would love the garden and the big bedroom on the main floor . She was totally unprepared for Jordan , whose brisk efficiency and patronizing air of possession and pity just turned Ellen 's stomach . <p> " I want to assure you that the house will be well-loved , " Jordan told her repeatedly , after showing up unexpectedly at the back door one day , tape measure in hand . " I adore it and we have great plans for it . " <p> Ellen was silent . She did n't want Jordan loving her house , any more than she would want Jordan loving her husband , even if he was her soon to be ex-husband . She did n't even want to meet Jordan , who had bought the house just weeks ago , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of May . Ellen did n't want to be able to picture the new family who would be living in her house , the other children who would make a clubhouse in the attic under the eaves and measure their growth against the doorjamb of the closet in the master bedroom . She had attended the closing last week by herself , signing the papers after Jordan and her husband had signed their part , signing away a whole life embodied by the little yellow house . <p> Ellen instantly mistrusted Jordan , quickly assessing her straight blond hair , cut in the usual suburban-mom bob , her small size ( she stood barely five foot three , Ellen guessed ) , and her persistently upbeat tone of voice , and making an immediate judgment that this was someone she would never like . Jordan had a heart-shaped face , with a sharp , almost elfin chin , china blue eyes , and a spattering of pale freckles across her nose . She had probably been a cheerleader , Ellen thought , and a sorority sister . Ellen , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid perkiness at all costs . <p> " I know this must be hard for you , " Jordan said . " But you should know that I 'm very good with houses . I was an art history and architecture major at U.Va . Where did you go to school ? " <p> The question irritated Ellen . To begin with , it had been more than twenty years since she 'd been in any kind of school , so she had no idea why that should be important . And it was also a question that was so completely " East Coast " as to be embarrassing . No one in Oregon ever asked-or cared-about your school affiliation . <p> " This is the West Coast , " Ellen said , a little sharply : " You 're not supposed to ask what college someone went to here . " <p> Jordan smiled . " I need to measure the kitchen window again for my contractor , " she said , putting her bag down on the tile countertop . " I 'll only be a minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny black capri pants and gray U.Va. sweatshirt , stretching the tape measure from one end of her windowsill to the other . Ellen felt suddenly and unreasonably enraged . And that 's when she first thought of burning down the house , picturing Jordan 's pert month in a perfect little O of astonishment when she heard the news . <p> Ellen did n't know what to do with the intensity of her feelings about the house . If she lost a parent , God forbid , or even a beloved pet , the outpouring of sympathy from her friends and family would be enormous and complete and sincere . But no one seemed to empathize with the huge sense of loss she had over the house , the grief that felt as real as any she had experienced . It was the death of a life , the life she and Sam and Sara and Louisa had had here and now would never have again . <p> To be perfectly honest , the house had its flaws . The kitchen was too small and dark and the upstairs bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first floor to the second was so steep and narrow they could n't even fit their queen-size box spring into the opening and had had to special-order one that was split in two . But their bedroom window looked out across the orchard next door , an overgrown tangle of espaliered apple trees , and beyond that over a row of Douglas firs to the purple and blue mounds of the Cascades in the distance . She had ripped up the carpet there herself , and stripped and sanded and polished the old oak floors until they glowed . She 'd spent weeks poring over paint chips and mixing colors and painting swatches on the walls to come up with just the right shade of blue-lavender , the same color as the mountains that ribboned across the horizon outside the window . She 'd stood each of the girls against the doorjamb to Sam 's closet twice a year and carefully marked the date and their height and their initials . It was not just rooms , not just a house ; it was an expression of Ellen herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside its walls . <p> Jordan , standing in Ellen 's kitchen , tapped her little foot impatiently . Ellen noted that she was wearing Tinker Bell sneakers . Why on earth a thirty-something woman who clearly had given birth and seen something of life would want to wear a Disney character on her feet was inexplicable to Ellen . <p> " Ellen ? You 'll be out by May thirty-first , right ? I really need to get my carpenters in here as soon as possible . " <p> Carpenters . Ellen saw hammers smashing great holes in the plaster of her walls , crowbars prying loose carefully painted moldings and cupboards . <p> " Yes , " she said . " By five on May thirty-first . " <p> " Good . " Jordan picked up her big brown handbag , overflowing with pens , blueprints ( for my house ! Ellen thought ) , and a sterling silver key fob attached to a ring of at least sixteen jangly keys . <p> " Oh , and Jordan ? " <p> Jordan turned , running a hand possessively over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Harvard . Early decision . Magna cum laude , " Ellen lied flawlessly . " See you in a few weeks . " <p> The last day of May was little more than three weeks away . Immediately after Jordan left , Ellen poured herself a cup of tea and sat down at the computer . Of course she could n't do anything obvious-she had two girls to raise , and no intention of spending the next twenty years in jail . She had to make sure no one was hurt . It had to be a contained fire , one that could n't spread to the neighbors ' homes or injure the firefighters . It had to be just enough to gut a room , pour thick smoke through the rest of the house , just enough to leave the house unsalvageable . Then Jordan and her carpenters could tear it down and build a perfect new house , one that would n't include the room where Ellen had lain in bed for five days after losing the baby , her middle child , or the rooms where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hot , hot " - her first word . <p> Ellen looked up electrical hazards . Overloaded sockets . Loose wires . Bare wires . Water near wires . The house was almost seventy years old , after all . Then again , the intricacies of electrical wiring terrified Ellen , who still had those little plastic protectors stuck in the sockets even though the girls were no longer babies , just because it made her feel better . No , she needed an accidental fire , something simple . Candles . <p> The screen door to the kitchen slammed , and Ellen quickly turned off the computer screen . <p> " Ellie ? " <p> " Here , in the office . " <p> Sam walked in and sat on the arm of the blue and white striped couch . His Navy , almost black hair stuck out in every direction . He was dressed in baggy tan corduroys and a navy blue Henley shirt that lay untucked over his pants . A two-day stubble of beard , black speckled with gray , covered the lean angles of his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when he drove her crazy . Part of it was simply that he was so physically beautiful and did n't even know it , and clearly did n't care . With his high cheekbones , thick dark brows , and brown-black eyes , he looked almost foreign , exotic . A gifted athlete , he moved with an unthinking grace , with a complete ease and familiarity with his body that Ellen envied . She looked at him and realized that , even though she was about to divorce him , she was still attracted to him and probably always would be . <p> " Are the girls home ? I promised I 'd take them for ice cream . " <p> " No , they 're not home yet . They 're staying at Joanna 's for dinner , " Ellen said . " But Jordan Boyce was here . She just left . " <p> " I thought you did n't want to meet her , " Sam said . He picked up Louisa 's pink rubber ball from the floor and began to toss it up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming to look at it . <p> " I did n't ! She called and asked if she could come take some measurements . I told her I 'd be out until six but would leave the back door unlocked . She showed up twenty minutes after I got home . I know she did it just so she could meet me and tell me how wonderfully she 's going to take care of the house . I hate her . " <p> " That 's silly , " Sam said , deftly tossing the ball above his head and catching it behind his back . <p> " It 's not silly , " Ellen said . " And stop throwing that ball . " <p> " It 's silly to hate someone you do n't even know , " Sam said , with some exasperation . He placed the ball down on the couch and looked at her . " You do n't know Jordan Boyce . You just met her . You hate her because you hate moving . " <p> " No , " Ellen said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is like having a conversation with a three-year-old , " Sam said . <p> " Oh , come on , Sam . She 's an idiot , with her little U.Va. sweatshirt and her fake sincerity . And the Realtor told me she 's named her children Lily and Daisy and Stamen , so they all have flower names . " <p> " She did n't name a child Stamen , " said Sam . " Really ? " <p> " She did ! When she had her son , she could n't name him Poppy or Iris or another girls ' flower name , so she named him Stamen . It sounds close enough to Holden and Caden and all those other trendy boy names you hear at every preschool now . And she kept telling me again and again how the house will be so well-loved-as though I did n't love it well enough ! " Ellen felt like crying again . <p> " Oh , come on , " Sam said . " It 's a house . It 's four walls and a roof and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our life is changing . You 'll have another house . " <p> " But it wo n't be this house , " Ellen said . " That 's like saying if Sara dies I can just have another child . " <p> " It 's nothing like that , " Sam said . He made a disgusted tsking sound with his tongue that really irritated her . " That 's a totally inappropriate analogy . You wanted this , remember ? " <p> " I did n't want this , " Ellen said . " I never wanted to leave the house . " <p> " Right , " said Sam . He stood up in front of the couch , both hands on his hips . " You just wanted to leave me . It 's no big deal to leave me , and to take the kids away from their father , but it 's huge to have to give up the house . " <p> Ellen looked at him mutely . She was forty-four , and she was tired . For the first six years of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen months . Sam was an inventor . After getting a degree in chemical engineering followed by a brilliant early career in product development for Procter &amp; Gamble , he 'd decided to start his own business , SamCan , Inc. , where he created a series of wildly imaginative new products . The problem was that every new idea seemed to be accompanied by his conviction that he had to live in just the right place to launch it . They moved to Fort Worth when Sam invented the line-dancing boot , footwear that contained a small metronome that tapped out the dance beat for the rhythm-impaired . When that did n't take off ( no one in Texas seemed to consider themselves rhythm-impaired ) , they moved on to Los Angeles , Salt Lake City , and then Brooklyn . Finally , twelve years ago , they arrived in Portland to perfect the Gutter Buddy , a motorized little broom that fit inside a gutter , chopped the pine needles and leaves into bits , then pushed them down the drainpipe . <p> And then Ellen simply refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and working endless hours to get her decorating business up and running in one town after another , she was done . She wanted to buy a house and paint the walls red , not some neutral rental color . She wanted to get pregnant and have babies . She wanted to plant bulbs and know she 'd be there in the spring to watch them bloom . She wanted to make friends and reminisce over shared memories that went back more than twelve months . <p> So they stayed . Sam took a job at Oregon Health &amp; Science University , working in biomedical engineering , and she opened her shop , Coffee@home , where she sold espresso drinks and home furnishings , and she had the babies and worked on the house and planted a perennial garden . She became best friends with Joanna , her next-door neighbor . They went through pregnancy and breast feeding and croup together , and their children were so close that Joanna 's daughter , Emily , became known as " Three , " the third child Ellen and Sam had wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ellen had finally allowed herself to believe that this was it , that she had roots that were deep and strong and permanent . So when Sam came home one day and announced that he had an absolutely brilliant idea that could fly only in New York , she said , simply , " No . " <p> The baby beeper was his best idea yet , Sam said . It was a tiny electronic beeper , the size of a pencil eraser , that could be sewed inside a onesie or a diaper cover . When the button was pushed on a remote , the beeper would go off , revealing the whereabouts of a wayward baby . Ellen had to admit that she loved the idea of the beeper . Louisa , an amazingly agile baby , had walked at ten months and taught herself to climb out of her crib at twelve months . Within a week she 'd thoroughly mastered the crib escape , leaving Ellen in a complete panic when she went to wake the baby from her nap , only to find an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of one memorable week she had found Louisa hiding in the cupboard under the bathroom sink , cheerfully eating a bar of vanilla-scented soap ; inside the wicker toy chest , humming to the stuffed animals ; and , most frightening of all , outside on the front lawn , holding out her naptime bottle to a fat robin . The idea that Louisa had managed to get out of not just the crib but the house terrified Ellen , who had spent fifteen agonizing minutes searching for her . If she 'd had a baby beeper , she could have found Louisa instantly And imagine how useful it would be in a mall or grocery store when a child darted off , Sam pointed out . <p> Once the idea for the baby beeper hit , Sam spent hours trying to develop a transmitter that was small enough to be easily stitched into a piece of baby clothing , yet powerful enough to send a loud signal from a good distance away . He wanted to quit work to devote himself to the baby beeper full-time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing stores like Hanna Andersson . He drew up a marketing plan . Still there was no place in the world like New York City for obsessed parents willing to spend money on the latest baby gadget , he said , and New York was the place to be if they were really going to make the baby beeper a success . <p> Ellen , while impressed with the baby beeper 's potential , still had her doubts and was adamant about not moving . What if the baby beeper did n't take off ? she argued . What if they ended up eighteen months from now with their savings depleted and Sam out of work ? They had children in school , with friends and routines and all the familiarity that years in one place finally had brought them . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
