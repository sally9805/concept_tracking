A lightning flash illuminated the Learjet that waited on the runway of the private airstrip moments before a thunderclap startled Dr. Clifford Grant . Grant scanned the darkness for signs of life , but there were no other cars in the lot and no one moving on the tarmac . When he checked his watch his hand trembled . It was 11:35 . Breach 's man was five minutes late . The surgeon stared at the glove compartment . A sip from his flask would steady his nerves , but he knew where that would lead . He had to be thinking clearly when they brought the money . Large drops fell with increasing speed . Grant turned on his wipers at the same moment a huge fist rapped on his passenger door . The doctor jerked back and stared . For an instant he thought the rain was distorting his vision ; but the man glaring at him through the window was really that big , a monster with a massive , shaved skull and a black knee-length leather coat . " Open the door , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant obeyed instantly . A chill wind blew a fine spray into the car . " Where is it ? " " In the trunk , " Grant said , the words catching in his throat as he jerked his thumb backward . The man tossed an attach case into the car and slammed the door shut . Water beaded the smooth sides of the briefcase and made the brass locks glisten . The money ! Grant wondered how much the recipient was going to pay for the heart , if he and his partner were receiving a quarter of a million dollars . Two rapid thumps brought Grant around . The giant was pounding on the trunk . He had forgotten to pop the release . As Grant reached for the latch another lightning flash lit the view through his rear window'and the cars that had appeared from nowhere . Without thinking , he floored the accelerator and cranked the wheel . The giant dove away with amazing agility as the sedan careened across the asphalt , leaving the smell of burning rubber . Grant was vaguely aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the police cars and took out part of a chain-link fence . Shots were fired , glass shattered and the car tipped briefly on two wheels before righting itself and speeding into the night . The next thing Clifford Grant remembered clearly was banging frantically on his partner 's back door . A light came on , a curtain moved and his partner glared at him in disbelief before opening the door . " What are you doing here ? " " The police , " Grant gasped . " A raid . " " At the airfield ? " " Let me in , for God 's sake . I 've got to get in . " Grant stumbled inside . " Is that the money ? " Grant nodded and staggered to a seat at the kitchen table . " Let me have it . " The doctor pushed the briefcase across the table . It opened with a clatter of latches , revealing stacks of soiled and crumpled hundred-dollar bills bound by rubber bands . The lid slammed shut . " What happened ? " " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course . And relax . You 're safe now . " Grant hunched over , his head between his knees . " I did n't make the delivery . " " What ! " " One of Breach 's men put the money on the front seat . The heart was in the trunk . He was about to open it when I saw police cars . I panicked . I ran . " " And the heart is . . . ? " " Still in the trunk . " " Are you telling me that you stiffed Martin Breach ? " " We 'll call him , " Grant said . " We 'll explain what happened . " A harsh laugh answered him . " Clifford , you do n't explain something like this to Breach . Do you understand what you 've done ? " " You have nothing to worry about , " Grant answered bitterly . " Martin has no idea who you are . I 'm the one who has to worry . We 'll just have to return the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there . " " You 're certain he does n't know who I am ? " " I never mentioned your name . " Grant 's head dropped into his hands and he began to tremble . " He 'll come after me . Oh , God . " " You do n't know that for sure , " his partner answered in a soothing tone . " You 're just frightened . Your imagination is running wild . " The shaking grew worse . " I do n't know what to do . " Strong fingers kneaded the tense muscles of Grant 's neck and shoulders . " The first thing you 've got to do is get hold of yourself . " The hands felt so comforting . It was what Grant needed , the touch and concern of another human being . " Breach wo n't bother you , Clifford . Trust me , I 'll take care of everything . " Grant looked up hopefully . " I know some people , " the voice assured him calmly . " People who can talk to Breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head fell forward from relief and fatigue . The adrenaline that had powered him through the past hour was wearing off . " You 're still tense . What you need is a drink . Some ice-cold Chivas . What do you say ? " The true extent of Grant 's terror could be measured by the fact that he had not even thought of taking a drink since he saw the police through his rear window . Suddenly every cell in his body screamed for alcohol . The fingers lifted ; a cupboard door closed ; Grant heard the friendly clink of ice bouncing against glass . Then a drink was in his hand . He gulped a quarter of the contents and felt the burn . Grant closed his eyes and raised the cold glass to his feverish forehead . " There , there , " his partner said as a hand slapped smartly against the base of Grant 's neck . Grant jerked upright , confused by the sharp sting of the ice pick as it passed through his brain stem with textbook precision . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's partner smiled with satisfaction . Grant had to die . Even thinking about returning a quarter of a million dollars was ridiculous . What to do with the heart , though ? The surgeon sighed . The procedure to remove it had been performed flawlessly , but it was all for nothing . Now the organ would have to be cut up , pureed and disposed of as soon as Grant took its place in the trunk .
