The stench of embalming fluid rose from the open coffin and struck Emily with the force of a tidal wave . She put a scented handkerchief to her nose and pushed her tongue against the roof of her mouth to keep from gagging . <br> " Really , Mrs. Stratton , " Mr. Phipps was at her side in a moment . " It was n't at all necessary for you to do this . It 's better if you could remember your husband as he was . " <br> " I had to see him , " Emily said through the handkerchief . " I had to be sure . " <br> Phipps averted his eyes from the corpse . The embalmers had n't got to it soon enough . <br> " There was no need , " he repeated . " Can we please shut that now ? " <br> Emily nodded . The poor man seemed on the edge of hysteria . One would think he 'd never looked on death before . Emily did feel ill , but for a different reason . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past eighteen years . <br> The lid slammed down . Phipps exhaled gratefully . <br> " There was never any doubt that it was Captain Stratton , " he told Emily with reproach . " I identified him myself and there were many at the hotel who knew him . You should have spared yourself this ordeal . " <br> " I 'm sorry , Mr. Phipps , " Emily said . " If I had n't seen him , there would always have been a doubt in my mind . Some part of me would have refused to believe he was gone and continued to expect him to return . " <br> Phipps nodded in sympathy . " I understand . At least he was n't lost at sea . Then you might have continued to hope forever . " <br> Hope ? Emily almost laughed . Dread was the word she would have used . The thud of the coffin lid over Horace 's body was like a bell of freedom . She had n't realized until that moment how much she feared the possibility that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never hurt anyone again . <br> The feeling was followed by a sense of shame . Whatever else Horace had done , he had provided for her and their son . Perhaps she had been the one who had failed . Her husband had believed that the young daughter of an unworldly missionary could be dutifully trained to suit his requirements . Emily knew she had n't lived up to expectations . <br> Emily sighed as she turned away from the coffin . Now neither of them would have the chance to change . <br> Phipps took her arm and led her out of the funeral parlor . He wished the woman had n't been so insistent on seeing her husband 's remains . But it was hard to reason with a grief-stricken widow . Inwardly , he shook his head in amazement that any woman could have been so blind as not to have known the kind of man Horace Stratton was . But perhaps the merchant had behaved differently during his brief stays at his home in Shanghai . Many men showed one face to their families and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that the private face might be worse . Emily returned to her hotel room . She left Mr. Phipps in the lobby after assuring him that she would dine at the hotel . He did n't press his invitation to join him and his wife at their home . <br> " Of course you need time to recover from all this . " He patted her hand . " To have come all the way from China and then have Captain Stratton die so suddenly while you were visiting in Monterey , you must feel devastated . Please feel free to call upon me at any time if I can assist you . " <br> Emily climbed the thickly carpeted stairs of the elegant hotel . Crystal chandeliers on each level glittered against mirrors , making the hallways seem infinite . The gaslight flickered in such a way that each reflection was slightly distorted , as if a hundred different faces looked back at her . She wondered if any of them were real . <br> In her room she was greeted by her maid , Mary Kate Kyne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife not bring any of the Chinese servants from Shanghai . He had been determined to make her adapt as quickly as possible to their new life in America . But at least it had been Emily and not Horace who had chosen the young Irishwoman , almost as new to the country as she . Mary Kate had been a chambermaid at the hotel in Monterey , where Horace had left Emily while he went up to San Francisco . She had proved so helpful and level-headed when word had come of his death that Emily had decided to take her on . <br> " There is no doubt , " she told Mary Kate , as the maid helped her off with boots and coat . " My husband is dead . Mr. Phipps assures me that I am now a wealthy widow . " <br> " Well , that 's something to be grateful for , is n't it ? " Mary Kate 's deep blue eyes showed her concern . <br> " It is , " Emily admitted . " My son shall want for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How can I tell him that his father has died ? If only the ship would arrive . I ca n't bear the fear that something might happen to him , too . " <br> Mary Kate made soothing noises . " It should only be a few more days before the lad is here with you . Did n't you say he was taking the train across Panama instead of going all the way around South America like I did ? Why , that journey should be nothing to a boy who 's traveled from China to Boston for his schooling . " <br> Emily smiled sadly . " I have no doubt that he 's enjoying the journey mightily . Robert always did love adventure . It seems odd that my husband was so insistent on our son studying law . You 'd think he 'd want Robert to become a merchant captain as he was . " <br> Mary Kate had quickly become used to her mistress speculating aloud and knew that she was n't required to comment . She took a clothes brush and began smoothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taking Captain Stratton 's coffin up to Oregon ? " she asked instead . Emily had said nothing of her plans . Mary Kate fretted that they might not include her , especially if Mrs. Stratton decided to return to China . <br> Emily nodded . " His sister telegraphed that she wanted him buried in the family plot . I replied that we would come as soon as Robert had some time to recover from the shock of such news on top of his long journey . " <br> She was quiet a moment , allowing the soft sound of the brush to calm her jangled nerves . <br> " Mr. Phipps seems to think that I should return to Shanghai , " she said at last , " but Horace wanted us to live in his old home in Portland . Even though it will be strange to me , I think that 's what we should do . There is nothing for me to return to . The house we lived in is let , the furniture all in boxes here at the wharf . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> She closed her eyes as unwanted memories rushed in . She resolutely pushed them back , took a deep breath , and concentrated on the problems of the present . As Mr. Longfellow said , she would " let the dead past bury its dead . " It was enough to cope with the living . <br> But how was she to cope ? Emily was truly grateful that she could live comfortably . She knew that she had no skills with which to support herself . In Shanghai the servants had been horrified at the idea that she should do anything but give orders and attend social functions . <br> She had n't been very good at that , either . <br> Suddenly she was the master of her fate . It terrified her . The next morning Mr. Phipps arrived at the hotel immediately after breakfast . He was armed with a portmanteau stuffed with documents for her to sign . <br> " What is all this ? " Emily looked up at him in bewilderment . <br> " Nothing for you to worry about , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the estate . Unfortunately , Captain Stratton did n't leave his affairs in the best of order . There was a will , of course . It leaves everything to you as guardian for your son , with provisions for your support once he comes of age . It will be formally read when you reach Portland . But there are a number of matters that ca n't wait . If you 'll just sign these , I can take care of everything . " <br> He smiled again . Perhaps it was the light , but Emily had the oddest impression that his canine teeth were longer and sharper than normal . <br> " Thank you , " she said . <br> He gestured for her to sit at the writing desk . <br> Emily remained in her chair by the window . <br> " I know very little about my husband 's business , " she explained . " But I think it 's time I learned . Please leave everything with me for now . I 'll read it all and ask you if there 's anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but , Mrs. Stratton , " he sputtered . " It will take you days to go through all of this . Many of these matters require immediate attention . " <br> " I see . " Emily walked over to the desk and leafed through the pile . " In that case , perhaps you could put the most pressing business on top . " <br> Phipps was both amazed and infuriated that such a small woman could be so adamant . First the ghoulish need to see the body , now her stubborn unwillingness to leave financial affairs in his hands . <br> He wondered if she was as ignorant about Horace 's business as she pretended . What if Emily Stratton had even helped in some of the more unsavory aspects of the import trade ? Her parents may have been missionaries , but that did n't mean their daughter was a holy innocent . <br> Grudgingly , Phipps relented and agreed to leave the papers for Emily to study . He was glad that she would soon be the problem of the surviving partners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening going through the stack of paperwork , stopping now and then to take a bite from the tray of sandwiches that the hotel had sent up . At first the documents seemed tediously straightforward , one lading bill after another , lists of shipments of tea , spices , porcelain , silk , opium , all the things that made the dangerous Pacific crossing worthwhile . <br> But as she laid the papers out in neat piles , trying to arrange them by date instead of subject , Emily began to realize that the figures did n't match . How could more have been delivered than had been put on the ship in the first place ? She ruffled through the papers , hunting for a second lading bill . Perhaps Horace had added a consignment of fruit and sugar in the Sandwich Islands . <br> Emily rubbed her eyes and began again . She would not own that Mr. Phipps had been right about her ability to understand business . She would simply have to learn . It was either that or continue to allow her life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> With cold fingers , she picked up her abacus and tried to make the sums come out . <br> As she felt the familiar click of the beads sliding across the metal rods , Emily 's mind wandered back to her childhood . She had learned to do sums on an abacus . The Chinese children in the classroom had laughed at her at first , but soon they forgot she was a foreign devil and made her one of their own . Her parents had wanted her to understand Chinese ways so that she could one day preach the Gospel to the natives in terms they understood . What they had not realized was that their Methodist daughter was being converted herself . <br> Although marriage to Horace had meant moving away from the poorer quarter where the missionaries worked into the world of European traders and soldiers , Emily had still felt that , however bad it was , she knew the rules of the world she lived in . <br> Then her parents had been killed in Nanking , and Shanghai itself had come under siege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , and she and Robert had faced the terror without him . Somehow , they had survived , although the horrors she had witnessed would be with Emily forever . <br> The events in Shanghai had convinced Horace that , as soon as the Civil War in America ended , Robert should return there with him to attend a preparatory academy in Boston . Two years later he had unexpectedly decided to move the family back to America and settle in his hometown of Portland , Oregon . There he planned on living well and impressing his friends with the wealth he had amassed in the Far East . He even spoke of entering politics . <br> Emily had not been consulted about any of this . She had been told to pack their things . A month later , they were at sea . Horace had arranged everything . Her only duty was to obey . Then he had died , leaving her to cope on her own . <br> Mr. Phipps had made it clear that Horace had expected her to continue to obey , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . What else was she good for ? <br> Emily did n't know , but she was determined to find out . <br> San Francisco was as alien to her as the moon . Portland might have been the land of Cockaigne for all she knew of it . How was she to navigate in this strange world ? The only ray of hope was in knowing that Robert would be with her soon . Emily was resolved to be strong for him , to prove that she could care for them both . More than anything , she wanted to keep Robert from the influence of the sort of men that Horace had associated with . The only way to do that was to deal with them herself . <br> She gave a sharp breath of frustration . Why would n't these stupid numbers add up ? <br> The abacus slipped from her fingers and bounced on the carpet , beads spinning . <br> Mary Kate found her the next morning , slumped over the desk , her cheek stuck to a customs form . <br> " Gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a terrible turn , all crumpled over . I was that glad to find you still breathing ! " <br> Emily groaned as she got up from the chair . " I 'm sorry , Mary Kate . " The paper she had drooled on in the night detached from her face and fluttered to the floor . The maid picked it up . <br> " All those chicken scratchings ! " she said . " Do n't tell me you spent the whole night winkling out the sense of them ? " <br> Emily looked ruefully at the scattered papers . " I 'm afraid not . " She sighed and stretched . " All I 'm sure of is that Mr. Phipps was right when he said that Robert and I are provided for . " <br> She stopped , her arms still in the air , and looked down at her severe black dress . A month in America had made her aware that it was ten years behind the fashion . <br> " Mary Kate , " she decided . " It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland to meet my husband 's family dressed like paupers , do n't you think ? " <br> Mary Kate put her hand down to cover the patch she had put on the one dress she owned that she thought good enough for a lady 's maid . " You do n't want them thinking you 're looking for charity , " she agreed . <br> Emily looked at the papers again , then at Mary Kate . An expression of wicked delight spread across her face . " You 're right , " she said firmly . " Help me gather these up and put them in the safe . You and I are going shopping . The wife of an English diplomat in Shanghai once told me that there was nothing like a new wardrobe to give a woman confidence . I am feeling very lacking in confidence at the moment . I 'm going to test her theory . Put on your cloak , Mary Kate ; we are going to be the most fashionable pair in the entire city . " When Mr. Phipps arrived to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily waiting for him . She was head to toe in black mourning , as was proper . But instead of the plain-cut wool with the severe collar she had worn the day before , this costume was almost sumptuous . <br> The dressmaker had informed Emily that this was the finest in mourning wear . The dress was in the Gabrielle style and made of black gabardine that shimmered in the gaslight . It was buttoned down the front with jet beads and trimmed with black Cluny lace and floss tassels . At the back was a deep flounce . The woman had pieced it together that day from bits already in the shop . More clothing would arrive over the next week . <br> Mr. Phipps 's only perception was that this elegant figure was not the woman he had parted from two days previously . She was more composed , more assured . She even seemed taller . The transformation unsettled him greatly . <br> " Good afternoon , Mr. Phipps , " Emily greeted him . " Please sit down . Would you like some tea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selected a small pile of papers . <br> " I believe that these are the only ones that need my signature at the moment , " she said as she handed them to him . " I appreciate the work you did to allow me to access immediate funds . The rest of the documents will require further study , I 'm afraid . I shall take them to Portland with me so that I can compare them with the records kept by Captain Stratton 's partners there . " <br> Phipps rose as if pulled at the end of a rope . <br> " Now , now , Mrs. Stratton , " he pleaded . " That is n't at all the thing to do ! " <br> " I believe I am now in charge of my husband 's business affairs , am I not ? " There was the merest hint of a knife in her tone . <br> " According to his will , yes , " Phipps admitted . " But he never intended for you to sully yourself with the mundane details . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " It is true that I have allowed myself to be left in ignorance of the source of that which provides my daily bread , " she said . " My husband was of your belief that such matters were not a woman 's provenance . " <br> Mr. Phipps started to relax . <br> " And yet . . . , " Emily added . <br> Phipps could feel his stomach tighten . <br> Emily smiled . " And yet he did leave the responsibility to me . I must at least try to fulfill his trust . " <br> " But , Mrs. Stratton . . . . " <br> " I am grateful for all you have done . Of course you must continue as agent to the company here in San Francisco . " Emily moved to open the door . " I shall take the steamer for Portland as soon as my son arrives . When we have settled in and buried Captain Stratton , I shall consult with his partners as to the future of the company . " <br> She glanced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearing at last . Do enjoy the rest of the day . " <br> There was nothing the man could do but take his hat and go . <br> He went immediately to the telegraph office to warn Stratton 's partners just what was about to descend on them . Emily hobbled back to the chair and eased into it . These high heels might be the latest style , and they did put her a bit closer to being able to look Mr. Phipps right in the eye , but they were horribly uncomfortable to balance in . <br> The little man had made a good point . It was very strange that Horace had left his business interests to her without appointing someone to manage them for her . Certainly , he had never given any indication that he thought her capable of understanding commerce . He had told her more than once that she was a great disappointment to him , in all respects . Perhaps he had believed he would live long enough to pass everything directly to his son . Or it may simply never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage things rather than turn business matters over to Mr. Phipps . <br> No , it was n't like Horace at all . Emily felt there was something she was missing . <br> There was a knock at the door . <br> " It 's the porter , ma'am . " Mary Kate was bubbling with excitement . " The ship from Boston has come in . Your son is here at last ! " <br> Emily 's face lit . Robert ! She fairly flew down the hotel stairs and into the waiting cab . In a few moments she would be able to hold her son in her arms again . <br> All the other worries were chased out by overwhelming joy . <br> Copyright 2008 by Sharan Newman .
