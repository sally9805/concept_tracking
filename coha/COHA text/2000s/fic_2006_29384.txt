THEY FOUND HIM in Ponta Pora , a pleasant little town in Brazil , on the border of Paraguay , in a land still known as the Frontier . They found him living in a shaded brick house on Rua Tiradentes , a wide avenue with trees down the center and barefoot boys dribbling soccer balls along the hot pavement . They found him alone , as best they could tell , though a maid came and went at odd hours during the eight days they hid and watched . They found him living a comfortable life but certainly not one of luxury . The house was modest and could 've been owned by any local merchant . The car was a 1983 Volkswagen Beetle , manufactured in Sao Paulo with a million others . It was red and clean , polished to a shine . Their first photo of him was snapped as he waxed it just inside the gate to his short driveway . They found him much thinner , down considerably from the two hundred and thirty pounds he 'd been carrying when last seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been squared , and his nose had been slightly pointed . Subtle changes to the face . They 'd paid a steep bribe to the surgeon in Rio who 'd performed the alterations two and a half years earlier . They found him after four years of tedious but diligent searching , four years of dead ends and lost trails and false tips , four years of pouring good money down the drain , good money chasing bad , it seemed . But they found him . And they waited . There was at first the desire to snatch him immediately , to drug him and smuggle him to a safe house in Paraguay , to seize him before he saw them or before a neighbor became suspicious . The initial excitement of the finding made them consider a quick strike , but after two days they settled down and waited . They loitered at various points along Rua Tiradentes , dressed like the locals , drinking tea in the shade , avoiding the sun , eating ice cream , talking to the children , watching his house . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they photographed him from across the street as he left the pharmacy . They eased very near him in a fruit market and listened as he spoke to the clerk . Excellent Portuguese , with the very slight accent of an American or a German who 'd studied hard . He moved quickly downtown , gathering his goods and returning home , where he locked the gate behind him . His brief shopping trip yielded a dozen fine photos . He had jogged in a prior life , though in the months before he disappeared his mileage shrunk as his weight ballooned . Now that he teetered on the brink of emaciation , they were not surprised to see him running again . He left his house , locking the gate behind him , and began a slow trot down the sidewalk along Rua Tiradentes . Nine minutes for the first mile , as the street went perfectly straight and the houses grew farther apart . The pavement turned to gravel on the edge of town , and halfway into the second mile his pace was down to eight minutes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was midday in October , the temperature near eighty , and he gained speed as he left town , past a small clinic packed with young mothers , past a small church the Baptists had built . The roads became dustier as he headed for the countryside at seven minutes a mile . The running was serious business , and it pleased them mightily . Danilo would simply run into their arms . THE DAY after the first sighting , a small unclean cottage on the edge of Ponta Pora was rented by a Brazilian named Osmar , and before long the rest of the pursuit team poured in . It was an equal mix of Americans and Brazilians , with Osmar giving the orders in Portuguese and Guy barking in English . Osmar could handle both languages , and had become the official interpreter for the team . Guy was from Washington , an ex-government type who 'd been hired to find Danny Boy , as he 'd been nicknamed . Guy was considered a genius at some levels and immensely talented at others , and his past was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract to find Danny Boy , and there was a nice bonus for snagging the prey . Though he hid it well , Guy had been slowly cracking under the pressure of not finding Danny Boy . Four years and three and a half million dollars , with nothing to show for it . But now they 'd found him . Osmar and his band of Brazilians had not the slightest hint of Danny Boy 's sins , but a fool could see that he 'd disappeared and taken a trainload of money . And , although he was very curious about Danny Boy , Osmar had learned quickly not to ask questions . Guy and the Americans had nothing to say on the subject . The pictures of Danny Boy were enlarged to eight by tens , and tacked along a wall in the kitchen of the dirty little cottage where they were studied by grim men with hard eyes , men who chain-smoked strong cigarettes and shook their heads at the photos . They whispered among themselves and compared the new photos to the old ones , the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , different nose . His hair was shorter and his skin darker . Was it really him ? They had been through this before , in Recife , on the northeastern coast , nineteen months earlier when they 'd rented an apartment and looked at photos on the wall until the decision was made to grab the American and check his fingerprints . Wrong prints . Wrong American . They pumped some more drugs in him and left him in a ditch . They were afraid to dig too deeply into the current life of Danilo Silva . If he was in fact their man , then he had plenty of money . And cash always worked wonders with the local authorities . For decades , cash had bought protection for Nazis and other Germans who 'd smuggled themselves into Ponta Pora . Osmar wanted to grab him . Guy said they 'd wait . He vanished on the fourth day , and the dirty little cottage was in chaos for thirty-six hours . They saw him leave home in the red Beetle . He was in a hurry , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jumped on a small commuter at the last moment , and was gone . His car was parked in the only lot , and they watched it every second of every hour . The plane was headed in the general direction of Sao Paulo , with four stops in between . There was instantly a plan to enter his home and catalog everything . There had to be records . The money had to be tended to . Guy dreamed of finding bank statements , wire transfer reports , account summaries ; all sorts of documents arranged in a neat portfolio which would lead him directly to the money . But he knew better . If Danny Boy ran because of them , then he would never leave behind the evidence . And if he was in fact their man , then his home would be carefully secured . Danny Boy , wherever he was , would probably know the instant they opened his door or window . They waited . They cursed and argued and strained even more under the pressure . Guy made his daily call to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each arrival brought out the binoculars and cell phones . Six flights the first day . Five the second . The dirty little cottage grew hot and the men settled outdoors -- the Americans napping under a scrawny shade tree in the backyard and the Brazilians playing cards along the fence in the front . Guy and Osmar took a long drive and vowed to grab him if he ever returned . Osmar was confident he would be back . Probably just out of town on business , whatever his business was . They 'd snatch him , identify him , and if he happened to be the wrong man they 'd simply throw him in a ditch and run . It had happened before . He returned on the fifth day . They trailed him back to Rua Tiradentes , and everybody was happy . ON THE EIGHTH DAY , the dirty cottage emptied as all the Brazilians and all the Americans took their positions . The course was a six-miler . He had covered it each day he 'd been home , leaving at almost the same time , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikes , ankle socks , no shirt . The perfect spot was two and a half miles from his house , over a small hill on a gravel road , not far from his turning-around point . Danilo topped the hill twenty minutes into his run , a few seconds ahead of schedule . He ran harder , for some reason . Probably the clouds . A small car with a flat tire was just over the hill , blocking the road , trunk opened , its rear jacked up . Its driver was a burly young man who pretended to be startled at the sight of the skinny racer sweating and panting as he topped the hill . Danilo slowed for a second . There was more room to the right . " Bom dia , " the burly young man said as he took a step toward Danilo . " Bom dia , " Danilo said , approaching the car . The driver suddenly pulled a large shiny pistol from the trunk and shoved it into Danilo 's face . He froze , his eyes locked onto the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thick hands and long , stout arms . He grabbed Danilo by the neck and yanked him roughly toward the car , then down to the bumper . He stuck the pistol in a pocket and with both hands folded Danilo into the trunk . Danny Boy struggled and kicked , but was no match . The driver slammed the trunk shut , lowered the car , tossed the jack into the ditch , and drove off . A mile away , he turned on to a narrow dirt path where his pals were anxiously waiting . They tied nylon ropes around Danny Boy 's wrists and a black cloth over his eyes , then shoved him into the back of a van . Osmar sat to his right , another Brazilian to his left . Someone removed his keys from the Velcro runner 's pouch stuck to his waist . Danilo said nothing as the van started and began moving . He was still sweating and breathing even harder . When the van stopped on a dusty road near a farm field , Danilo uttered his first words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Portuguese . " Do n't speak , " came the reply from Osmar , in English . The Brazilian to Danilo 's left removed a syringe from a small metal box and deftly filled it with a potent liquid . Osmar pulled Danilo 's wrists tightly toward him while the other man jabbed the needle into his upper arm . He stiffened and jerked , then realized it was hopeless . He actually relaxed as the last of the drug entered his body . His breathing slowed ; his head began to wobble . When his chin hit his chest , Osmar gently , with his right index finger , raised the shorts on Danilo 's right leg , and found exactly what he expected to find . Pale skin . The running kept him thin , and it also kept him brown . Kidnappings were all too common in the Frontier . Americans were easy targets . But why him ? Danilo asked himself this as his head wobbled and his eyes closed . He smiled as he fell through space , dodging comets and meteors , grabbing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under some cardboard boxes filled with melons and berries . The border guards nodded without leaving their chairs , and Danny Boy was now in Paraguay , though he could n't have cared less at the moment . He bounced happily along on the floor of the van as the roads grew worse and the terrain steeper . Osmar chain-smoked and occasionally pointed this way and that . An hour after they grabbed him , they found the last turn . The cabin was in a crevice between two pointed hills , barely visible from the narrow dirt road . They carried him like a sack of meal and poured him onto a table in the den where Guy and the fingerprint man went to work . Danny Boy snored heavily as prints were made of all eight fingers and both thumbs . The Americans and the Brazilians crowded around , watching every move . There was unopened whiskey in a box by the door , just in case this was the real Danny Boy . The print man left abruptly and went to a room in the back where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He adjusted his lighting . He removed the master set , those freely given by Danny Boy when he was much younger , back when he was Patrick and seeking admission to the State Bar of Louisiana . Odd , this fingerprinting of lawyers . Both sets were in fine shape , and it was immediately obvious they were a perfect match . But he meticulously checked all ten . There was no hurry . Let them wait out there . He rather enjoyed the moment . He finally opened the door and frowned hard at the dozen faces searching his . Then he smiled . " It 's him , " he said , in English , and they actually clapped . Guy approved the whiskey , but only in moderation . There was more work to do . Danny Boy , still comatose , was given another shot and carried to a small bedroom with no window and a heavy door which locked from the outside . It was here that he would be interrogated , and tortured , if necessary . THE BAREFOOT BOYS playing soccer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Danny Boy 's key ring had only four keys on it , and so the small front gate was unlocked quickly , and left open . An accomplice in a rented car came to a stop near a large tree four houses down . Another , on a motorbike , parked himself at the other end of the street and began tinkering with his brakes . If a security system started howling upon entry , the intruder would simply run and never be seen again . If not , then he would lock himself in and take inventory . The door opened without sirens . The security panel on the wall informed whoever might be looking that the system was disarmed . He breathed lightly and stood perfectly still for a full minute , then began to move around . He removed the hard drive from Danny Boy 's PC , and collected all the disks . He rummaged through files on his desk , but found nothing but routine bills , some paid , others waiting . The fax was cheap and featureless , and declared itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , food , furniture , bookshelves , magazine racks . Five minutes after the door opened , a silent signal was activated in Danilo 's attic and a phone call was placed to a private security firm eleven blocks away , in downtown Ponta Pora . The call went unanswered because the security consultant on duty was swaying gently in a hammock out back . A recorded message from Danilo 's house informed whoever was supposed to be listening that there was a break-in . Fifteen minutes passed before human ears heard the message . By the time the consultant raced to Danilo 's house , the intruder was gone . So was Mr. Silva . Everything appeared to be in order , including the Beetle under the carport . The house and gate were locked . The directions in the file were specific . On such alarms , do not call the police . Try first to locate Mr. Silva , and in the event he can not be found at once , then call a number in Rio . Ask for Eva Miranda . WITH BARELY suppressed excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes and smiled when he uttered the words , " It 's him . " His voice was an octave higher . There was a pause on the other end . Then , " You 're certain ? " " Yes . Prints are a perfect match . " Another pause while Stephano arranged his thoughts , a process that usually took milliseconds . " The money ? " " We have n't started yet . He 's still drugged . " " When ? " " Tonight . " " I 'm by the phone . " Stephano hung up , though he could 've talked for hours . Guy found a perch on a stump behind the cabin . The vegetation was dense , the air thin and cool . The soft voices of happy men drifted up to him . The ordeal was over , for the most part . He had just earned an extra fifty thousand dollars . Finding the money would mean another bonus , and he was certain he 'd find the money .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
