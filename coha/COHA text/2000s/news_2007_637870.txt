<p> Some may view BarbersQ as a Disneyland version of a barbecue restaurant , what with its upscale California appearance . Yet there 's no denying that the ribs are great . <p> Unlike the stereotypical rib shacks are usually found in stripped-down strip malls or run-down clapboard buildings , this new Napa restaurant is in the back of the tree-lined Bel Aire complex , flanked by Target and a soon-to-open Whole Foods . <p> Its beauty is more than skin-deep . I do n't see how even a purist can complain about the ribs ( call me naive ) . Put aside any preconceived notion of what a Memphis pulled-pork sandwich ( $9.95 ) or St. Louis dry-rubbed spare ribs ( $14.75 ) should be like , and you 'll save yourself a lot of grief . Purists be damned , this is good stuff . <p> Partners Gene Tartaglia and Stephen Barber  --  hence the name  --  worked together at Mecca in San Francisco . When Tartaglia sold the popular San Francisco spot and decided to open a place closer to his home in Napa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue joint , and gave him a call . <p> Opening a restaurant in Napa Valley may be even harder than it is in San Francisco ; it took nearly two years to get everything together . What they ended up with is decidedly more upscale than the name implies . The interior was designed by Stephen Brady , so it 's little wonder the 56-seat dining room has a sensibility similar to that of the Village Pub in Woodside or the flagship Banana Republic stores in New York and San Francisco , which the designer also had a hand in . <p> The concrete floors are juxtaposed with dark wood tables , oak partitions , leatherette banquettes , an eight-seat marble bar and a beamed ceiling with acoustical tile to dampen noise . The walls feature museum-quality black-and-white photographs of the Napa Valley shot by John Kuss . Tartaglia commissioned the Florida photographer to turn a fresh eye on the people and places in Napa . He spent a week snapping 1,500 pictures ; 28 are used in the restaurant . <p> The tables are set with heavy weighted flatware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Riedel wineglasses  --  this is the Napa Valley , after all . Outdoors enthusiasts can head for the umbrella-shaded tables that overlook the nicely landscaped parking lot . <p> Barber is no ordinary ' cue chef , either . He worked extensively on the East Coast and in Miami before Tartaglia brought him to San Francisco , where he earned a three-star review during his two years at Mecca . <p> The two have created a restaurant that is appropriate for many occasions . On one visit , a family sat next to us and talked about their day while the father and ' tweener daughter devoured the pulled-pork sandwich  --  slow cooked in spices for 12 to 14 hours  --  and the mother concentrated on the barbecued half-chicken ( $14.75 ) served with collard greens from Tartaglia 's garden . <p> During the meal the daughter explained how she and her friends nominated their teacher for an extreme makeover , leading to a pointed , touching discussion about illusions of beauty , tolerance of other people 's situations and kindness . <p> On our other side a young couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine on the table , and shared a plate of grilled oysters enhanced with garlic butter and pepper salsa ( $14.50 ) . <p> They also had the chipotle-braised short rib sandwich ( $14.75 ) , which looked so good I had to order it on my second visit . It was as good as it looked ; the tender , moist meat is topped with horseradish sauce on Alexis Baking Co. buns whose thin , crusty exterior works like a shell to keep everything together . <p> I was just starting my meal with the wedge salad ( $8.95 ) , two generous chunks of iceberg lettuce with tangy Point Reyes blue cheese dressing ; a crisscross of smoky bacon from Benton , a lauded producer in Madisonville , Tenn. ; and thin slices of radishes . It was cooling and refreshing , especially after the fried pink shrimp ( $12.50 ) accompanied by hearts of palm and the spicy zing of habanero tartar sauce . The four shrimp tasted good , but the portion seemed a little meager in comparison to other items on the menu . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not more than a 5-ounce portion , for $24.75 . It looked forlorn compared with the generous hunk of baby back ribs ( $14.75 for half a rack ) , falling-off-the-bone tender and served with a cool creamy slaw , its mild sweetness balanced by a touch of spice . <p> The ribs are served naked  --  they need nothing to enhance their natural goodness  --  but a tray of condiments on each table includes various barbecue sauces so people can add their own . <p> Barber also does a great job with the St. Louis-style spareribs . Like the baby backs , these are dry-rubbed with five kinds of dried chiles grown in his garden . The racks are then slow-cooked for five hours over cherrywood , which imparts a mild , sweet flavor . <p> His chicken soup would make any grandmother envious , with perfectly diced bits of vegetables , meat and a snowfall of Parmesan . He also makes a really good chili ( $9.75 ) , with chunks of grass-fed sirloin , yellow eye beans and a gentle , smoldering kick . I was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so disappointing , with an unexpectedly flat , harsh taste . <p> BarbersQ also reaches far beyond what you 'd expect of a barbecue restaurant by offering appetizers such as mini lamb burgers ( $12.75 ) , two small sandwiches smeared with tomato marmalade and grilled onions ; and house-made cheddar and scallion biscuits ( $7.95 ) filled with thin slices of Benton 's country ham and served with a spicy-sweet red pepper jelly . <p> On my last visit , I finally got the vinegar chicken ( $28.95 ; serves two to four ) , a whole bird roasted to order . When I saw it come out of the kitchen on my first visit , I knew I needed to have it next time around , but it was n't available . I was doubly disappointed because I was n't told until after I ordered it . The brined chicken is dressed with an emulsion of olive oil , Cabernet and Merlot vinegar , and garden-grown garlic , rosemary , thyme and oregano . It 's served with still-firm Lundberg white rice to help sop up the piquant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken was n't available on that second visit spotlights problems with the young servers  --  some are very good and proactive , and others walk around looking as if they do n't quite know what to do . Fortunately , service improved on each visit , much like the desserts . <p> The first time around , I ordered the hot apple pie ( $7.50 ) , which paled in comparison to what you get at McDonald 's . By my next visit that had been replaced by a homey strawberry shortcake . Other choices include a satisfying hot fudge sundae with candied pecans and brandied cherries ( $6.95 ) , a chocolate bourbon pecan pie ( $9.50 ) and a tart lime pie with a graham cracker crust ( $6.50 ) . <p> It 's obvious from start to finish that Barber and Tartaglia know what they 're doing and are appealing to residents who have grown tired of the endless parade of Italian and French places that have proliferated . Although barbecue is at its core , BarbersQ is best considered a fully realized restaurant that happens to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Look at the wine list  --  or even the fact that there is a wine list  --  and you 'll understand that BarbersQ is no ordinary barbecue restaurant . <p> For one , it was put together by winemaker and master sommelier Emmanuel Kemiji and includes 75 West Coast selections , heavy on the reds , naturally . The least expensive are the 2004 Bishop 's Peak Syrah and the 2004 Sutton Carignane , both $32 . The prices top out at $250 for the 2002 Shafer Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon . <p> Nearly a third of the wines are offered by the glass , priced between $6 and $12 . <p> Markups are just slightly higher than average , but are justified by the care taken with the list and the glasses . It 's too bad , however , that the reds are n't served a little cooler . <p> The restaurant also features a to-go section for both takeout food and wine , which is priced slightly higher than retail but is still reasonable . <p> The beverage selections also include some very good dessert wines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as should be expected , a very good array of beers . <p> Corkage is $15 , with a limit of two bottles per party .  --  M.B. <p> CHART : <p> BarbersQ 3900-D Bel Aire Plaza ( at Trancas and Highway 29 ) , Napa ; ( 707 ) 224-6600 .
