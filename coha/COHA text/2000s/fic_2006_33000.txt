The Man from Capetown * * * Stuart M. Kaminsky It was raining . It was not the usual slow , cold gray London rain that spattered on umbrellas and broad brimmed hats but the heavy relentless downpour that came several times a year jungle drumming on the rooftops of cabs reminding me of the more mild monsoons I had witnessed in my years in India . Time in India always moved slowly . Time in the apartment I shared with Sherlock Holmes had moved at the pace of a torpid Bombay cat during the past two weeks . I kept myself busy trying to write an article for The Lancet based on Holmes ' findings about the differences he had discovered between blood from people native to varying climates . At first Holmes had entered into the endeavor with vigor and interest , pacing , smoking his pipe , pausing to remind me of subtle differences and the implications of his discovery both for criminology and medicine . Several days into the enterprise , however , Holmes had taken to standing at the window for hours at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts he chose not to share with me . Twice he picked up the violin . The first time he woke me at five in the morning with something that may have been Liszt . The second time was at one in the afternoon when he repeatedly played a particularly mournful tune I did not recognize . On this particular morning , Holmes was sitting in his armchair , pipe in hand , looking at the coal scuttle . " Rather interesting item in this morning 's Times , " I ventured as I sat at the table in our sitting room with the last of my morning tea and toast before me . Holmes made a sound somewhere between a grunt and a sigh . " A Mr. Morgan Fitchmore of Leeds , " he said . " Found in a cemetery on his back with a railroad spike plunged into his heart . He was gripping the spike , apparently in an attempt to remove it . The night had been damp and the police found no footprints in the mud other than those of the deceased . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police are baffled . " Holmes grunted again and looked toward the window where the rain beat heavily on the glass . " Yes , " I said . " That is the story . I thought it might interest you . " " Minimally , " said Holmes . " Read the rest of the story , Watson , as I have . Fitchmore was a petty thief . He was found lying on his back . The dead man appears to have left no signs that he attempted to defend himself . " " Yes , I see , " I said reading further . " What was a petty thief doing in a graveyard on a rainy night ? " Holmes said drawing on his pipe . " Why would someone attack him with a railroad spike ? Why were there no other footprints ? Why did he not struggle ? " " I could n't say , " I said . " Railroad spikes make passable chisels , Watson . A thief might well go into a graveyard at night with a spike and hammer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might sell for a slight sum . Such assaults on the resting place of the dead are not uncommon . A rainy night would ensure a lack of intrusion . " " I fail to see ... " " It is not a matter of seeing , Watson . It is a matter of putting together what has been seen with simple logic . Fitchmore went to the graveyard to rob the dead . He slipped in the mud flinging his hammer away as he fell forward on the spike he held in his hand . He rolled over on his back , probably in great agony , and attempted to pull the spike from his chest , but he was already dying . There is no mystery , Watson . It was an accidental if , perhaps , ironically apropos end for a man who would steal from the dead . " " Perhaps we should inform the police in Leeds , " I said . " If you wish , " said Holmes indifferently . " May I pour you a cup of tea ? You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said his eyes now turned to the fireplace where flames crackled and formed kaleidoscope patterns which seemed to mesmerize Holmes who had not bothered to fully dress . He wore his gray trousers , a shirt with no tie and a purple silk smoking jacket that had been given to him by a grateful client several years earlier . In the past month , Holmes had been offered three cases . One involved a purloined pearl necklace . The second focused on an apparent attempt to defraud a dealer in Russian furs and the third a leopard missing from the London zoo . Holmes had abruptly refused all three entreaties for his help and had directed the potential clients to the police . " If the imagination is not engaged , " he had said when the zoo director had left , " and there is no worthy adversary , I see no point in expending energy and spending time on work that could be done by a reasonably trained Scotland Yard junior inspector . " Holmes suddenly looked up at me . " Do you have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he spoke and in the hope of engaging his interest I retrieved it from the portmanteaus near the fireplace which crackled with flames which cast unsettling morning shadows across the sitting room . The letter had arrived several weeks ago and aside from the fact that it bore a Capetown postmark , it struck me as in no way singular or more interesting than any of a dozen missives that Holmes had done no more than glance at in the past several weeks . " Would you read it aloud once more , Watson , if you please ? " " Mr. Sherlock Holmes , " it read : I have a matter of the greatest importance to set before you . I have some business to attend to here in Capetown . It should take no more than a few days . I will then set forth for England in the hope of seeing you immediately upon my arrival . I must hurry now to get this letter on the next ship bound for Portsmouth . This is a matter of money , love and a palpable threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consultation . Cost is no object . The letter was signed , Alfred Donaberry . I folded the letter and looked at Holmes wondering why this particular correspondence , among the many so much like it he had received over the years , should draw his interest and why he had chosen this moment to return to it . As he had done so many times before , Holmes answered my unspoken questions . " Note the order in which our Mr. Donaberry lists his concerns , " said Holmes looking in my direction and pointing his pipe at the missive in my hand . " Money , love and life . Mr. Donaberry lists the threat to his life last . Curious . As to why I am now interested in the letter , I ask a question . Did you hear a carriage stop in the street a moment ago ? " I had and I said so . " If you check the arrival of ships in the paper from which you have just read you will note that the Principia , a cargo ship , arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as concerned as his letter indicates , he may well have been on that ship and braved the foul weather to make his way to us . " " It could be anyone , " I said . " The rig , judging from the sound of its wheels on the cobblestone , is a large one , not a common street cab and it is drawn by not one but two horses . I hear no other activity on the street save for this vehicle . The timing is right and , I must confess to a certain curiosity about a man who would venture from as far as Capetown to pay us a visit . No , Watson , if this man is as anxious to meet me as his letter indicates , he will have been off the boat and on his way catching the seven o'clock morning train . " A knock at the door and a small smile from Holmes accompanied by a raised eyebrow in satisfaction were aimed my way . " Enter Mrs. Hudson , " Holmes called . Our landlady entered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes and shook her head . " A lady to see you , " she said . " A lady ? " Holmes asked . " Most definitely , " Mrs. Hudson said . " Please tell the lady that I am expecting a visitor and that she will have to make an appointment and return at a future time . " Mrs. Hudson was at the door with tray in hand . Over her shoulder she said , " The lady said to tell you that she knows you are expecting a visitor from South Africa . That is why she must see you immediately . " Holmes looked at me with arched eyebrows . I shrugged . " Please show her in Mrs. Hudson and , if you would be so kind , please brew us a fresh pot of tea , " Holmes said . " You 've eaten nothing Mr. Holmes , " she said . " Perhaps I can bring you some fresh biscuits and jam ? " " Tea and biscuits will be perfect , " Holmes said as she closed the door behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So our Mr. Donaberry is not the only one who would willingly venture out in a storm like this , " I said pretending to return to the newspaper . " So it would seem , Watson . " The knock at the door was gentle . A single knock . Holmes called out , " Come in " and Mrs. Hudson ushered in an exquisite dark creature with clear white skin and raven hair brushed back in a tight bun . She wore a prim black dress buttoned to the neck . The woman stepped in , looked from me to Holmes and stood silently for a moment till Mrs. Hudson had closed the door . " Mr. Holmes , " she said in a soft voice suggesting just the touch of an accent . " I am he , " said Holmes . " My name is Elspeth Belknapp , Mrs. Elspeth Belknapp , " she said . " May I sit ? " " By all means Mrs. Belknapp , " Holmes said pointing to a chair near the one in which I was sitting . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said as she sat . " I have come to ... " " First a few questions , " said Holmes folding his hands in his lap . " How did you know Donaberry was coming to see me ? " " I ... a friend in Capetown sent me a letter , the wife of a clerk in Alfred 's office , " she said . " May I have some water ? " I rose quickly and moved to the decanter Mrs. Hudson had left on the table . I poured a glass of water and handed it to her . She drank as I sat down and looked over at Holmes who seemed to be studying her carefully . " Mr. Holmes , " she said . " I was , until five months ago , Mrs. Alfred Donaberry . Alfred is a decent man . He took me in when my own parents died in a fire in Johannesburg . Alfred is considerably older than I. I was most grateful to him and he was most generous to me . And then , less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct business with my then husband . " " And what business is that ? " Holmes asked . " The diamond trade , " she said . " Alfred has amassed a fortune dealing in diamonds . Though I tried not to do so , I fell in love with John Belknapp and he with me . I behaved like a coward Mr. Holmes . John wanted to confront Alfred but I wanted no scene . I persuaded John that we should simply run away and that I would seek a divorce citing Alfred 's abuse and infidelity . " " And was he abusive and unfaithful ? " asked Holmes . She shook her head . " I am not proud of what I did . Alfred was neither abusive nor unfaithful . He loved me but I thought of him less as a husband than as a beloved uncle . " " And so , " said Holmes , " you obtained a divorce . " " Yes , I came to London with John and obtained a divorce . John and I married the day after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred would read the note I had left for him when I fled with John and that Alfred would resign himself to the reality . But now I find ... " " I see , " said Holmes . " And what would you have me do ? " " Persuade Alfred not to cause trouble , to leave England , to return to South Africa , to go on with his life . Should he confront John ... John is a fine man , but he is somewhat on occasion and when provoked given to unconsidered reaction . " The woman removed a kerchief from her sleeve and dabbed at her eyes . " He can be violent ? " asked Holmes . " Only when provoked , Mr. Holmes . Alfred Donaberry is a decent man , but were he to confront John ... " At this point Mrs. Hudson knocked and entered before she was bidden to do so . She placed biscuits and jam upon the table with three plates , knives and a fresh pot of tea . She looked at the tearful Elspeth Belknapp with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said taking up a knife and using it to generously coat a biscuit with what appeared to be gooseberry jam . " You say your former husband is a man of considerable wealth ? " " Considerable , " she said accepting a cup of tea from me . " Describe him . " " Alfred ? He is fifty-five years of age , pleasant enough looking though I have heard people describe him as homely . He is large , a bit , how shall I say this ... Alfred is an uneducated , a self-made man , perhaps a bit rough around the edges , but a good , gentle man . " " I see , " said Holmes , a large piece of biscuit and jam in his mouth . " And he has relatives , a mother , sister , brother , children ? " " None , " she said . " So , if he were to die , who would receive his inheritance ? " " Inheritance ? " " In his letter to me , he mentions that his visit is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might unless he has removed me from his will . " " And your new husband ? He is a man of substance ? " " John is a dealer in fine gems . He has a secure and financially comfortable position with London Pembroke Gems Limited . If you are implying that John married me in the hope of getting Alfred 's estate , I assure you you are quite wrong Mr. Holmes . " " I am merely trying to anticipate what direction Mr. Donaberry 's concerns will take him when we meet . May I ask what you are willing to pay for my services in dissuading Mr. Donaberry from further pursuit of the issue ? " " I thought ... Pay you ? John and I are not wealthy , " she said , " but I 'll pay what you wish should you be successful in persuading Alfred to return to South Africa . I do not want to see him humiliated or hurt . " " Hurt ? " asked Holmes . " Emotionally , " she said quickly . " I see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under advisement . Should I decide to take it , how shall I reach you ? " Elspeth Belknapp rose and removed a card from her small purse . She handed the card to Holmes . " Your husband 's business card , " Holmes said . " My home address is on the back . " She held out her hand to me . I took it . She was trembling . " Holmes failed to introduce me , " I said glancing reproachfully at my friend . " You are Dr. Watson , " she said . " I 've read your accounts of Mr. Holmes ' exploits and have remarked on your own humility and loyalty . " It was my turn to smile . She turned to Holmes who had risen from his chair . He took her hand and held it , his eyes on her wedding ring . " A lovely diamond and setting , " he said . " Yes , " she said looking at the ring . " It is far too valuable to be worn constantly . A simple band would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes up his mind ... Please Mr. Holmes , help us , John , me and Alfred . " The rain was still beating and the wind blowing even harder as she departed closing the door softly as she left . " Charming woman , " I said . " Yes , " said Holmes . " Love is not always kind or reasonable , " I observed . " You are a hopeless romantic , Watson , " he said moving to the window and parting the curtains . " Not much of a challenge in this one , " I observed . " We shall see , Watson . We shall see . Ah , she wears a cape and carries an umbrella . Sensible . " I could hear the carriage door close and listened as it pulled away , horses clomping slowly into the distance . Holmes remained at the window without speaking . He checked his watch from time to time but did not waver from his vigil till the sound of another carriage echoed down Baker Street . " And this shall be our forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah yes , the carriage has stopped . He has gotten out . No umbrella . A big man . Let us move a chair near the fire . He will be drenched . " And indeed , when Mrs. Hudson announced and ushered Alfred Donaberry into the room , he was wet , thin hair matted against his scalp . His former wife had been kind in describing him as homely . He had sun darkened skin and a brooding countenance and bore a close resemblance to a bull terrier . In his left hand he carried a large and rather battered piece of luggage . His clothing , trousers , shirt and jacket were of good quality though decidedly rumpled and the man himself was quite disheveled and in need of a shave . His wrinkled suit was dark , a bit loose . " Please forgive my appearance . I came here straightaway from the railway station , " he said setting down his suitcase and holding out his hand . " Donaberry . Alfred Donaberry . " Holmes shook it . I did the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherlock Holmes and this is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson . Wo n't you sit by the fire . " " I thank you , sir , " Donaberry said moving to the chair I had moved next to the warmth of the hearth . " I may as well get right to it , " the man said holding his hands toward the fire . " Your wife has left you , " Holmes said . " Some three months ago . You recently discovered that she is in London and you 've come in pursuit of her . " " How did you ... ? " " You missed her by but a few minutes , " Holmes said . " How did she know I ... ? " Donaberry said perplexed . " Let us lay that aside for the moment , " said Holmes and , if you will , get to the heart of your problem . " " Heart of the problem . Ironical choice of words , Mr. Holmes , " he said . " No , I am not pursuing Elspeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can understand though I am broken of heart . The minute I read the note she had left me those months ago I accepted reality and removed my wedding ring . " He held up his left hand to show a distinct white band of skin where a ring had been . " You do not want to find her or her new husband ? " Holmes asked . " No sir , " he said . " I want nothing to do with him , the jackanapes who stole her from me and polluted her mind . I want you to find them and stop them before they succeed in murdering me within the next month . " I looked at Holmes with a sense of shock but Holmes simply popped yet another piece of biscuit and jam into his mouth . " Why should they want to murder you Mr. Donaberry ? " I asked . He looked at me . " I have entered my will for change in the courts , " he said . " In one month time , Elspeth will be my heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . Donaberry shifted uncomfortably in his chair and looked down before speaking . " When we married , because of my age and sometimes fragile health , I feared for Elspeth 's future should I die . Though by law she would inherit , I have distant relatives in Cornwall who might well make claim on my estate or some part of it . Therefore , I entered specifically into my will that Elspeth should inherit everything and that there should be no revocation or challenge to my will and my desire . My solicitor now informs me , and Elspeth well knows and has certainly informed her new husband , that it will take a month longer to execute the changing of the will , so carefully has it been worded . For you see , the word ' wife ' never appears in the will , only the name Elspeth Donaberry . " " But what , " I asked , " makes you think they plan to kill you ? " " The two attempts which have already been made upon my life in South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once when I was in field a fortnight past . I spend much of my time when weather permits and the beating sun is tolerable , in the flats and mountains searching for gem deposits . It was a particularly blistering day when I was fired upon . Three shots from the cover of trees . One shot struck a rock only inches from my head . I was fortunate enough to escape with my life . In the second instance , an attempt was made to push me off a pier onto a trio of sharpened pilings . Only by the grace of God did I fall between the pilings . " " You have other enemies besides Belknapp and your wife ? " " None , and Mr. Holmes , I do n't blame Elspeth necessarily , but that John Belknapp is a piece of work with friends of an unsavory bent and though he might have persuaded her otherwise , I know from my most reliable sources that John Belknapp is in serious financial trouble . He is a profligate , a speculator and a gambler . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And you want me to protect you ? " asked Holmes . " I want you to do whatever it takes to keep Belknapp from killing me or having me killed . He 's more than half a devil . " It sounded to me like the kind of case Holmes would have sent straightaway to Lestrade and the Yard . " The price will be two hundred pounds payment in advance , " said Holmes . Donaberry did not hesitate . He stood up , took out his wallet and began placing bills on the table counting aloud as he did so . " Thank you , " said Holmes . " Dr. Watson and I will do our utmost to see to it that murder does not take place . Where will you be staying in London ? " " I have a room reserved at The Cadogan Hotel on Sloane Street , " he said . The Cadogan was a small hotel known to be the London residence of Lilly Langtree and rumored to be an occasional hideaway for the notorious playwright Oscar Wilde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Only you and Dr. Watson , " he said . " Very good , " said Holmes . " Remain in your room . Eat in the hotel . We will contact you when we have news . And Mr. Donaberry , do not go out the front door and do not take the cab that is waiting for you . You may be watched . Dr. Watson will show you how to get out the back entrance . There is a low fence . I suggest you climb it and work your way out to the street beyond . Mrs. Hudson will provide you with an umbrella . " " My suitcase , " he said . " Dr. Watson or I will return it to you the moment it is safe to do so . I can not see a man of your size and age climbing fences with the burden of this luggage . " Donaberry looked as if he were thinking deeply before deciding to nod his head in reluctant agreement . " Then be off , " Holmes said . " Remember , stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible with the door locked . Take all your meals in the hotel dining room . The food is not the best but it is tolerable . " Donaberry nodded and I led him out the door and down to the back entrance after he had retrieved his coat and Mrs. Hudson had provided an umbrella . Holmes was pacing the floor , hands behind his back when I returned to our rooms and said , " Holmes , while I sympathize with Mr. Donaberry 's situation , I see nothing in it to capture your attention or make use of your skills . " " I 'm sorry , Watson , what did you say ? I was lost in a thought about this curious situation . There are so many questions . "
