Chapter One " We got trouble . " I recognized Zo 's voice , but I did n't turn around from my computer . I was too absorbed in a news report on the website AviationNow.com . A competitor 's new plane had crashed a couple of days ago , at the Paris Air Show . I was n't there , but my boss was , and so were all the other honchos at my company , so I 'd heard all about it . At least no one was killed . And at least it was n't one of ours . I picked up my big black coffee mug-the hammond skycruiser : the future of flight-and took a sip . The coffee was cold and bitter . " You hear me , Landry ? This is serious . " I swiveled slowly around in my chair . Zo Robichaux was my boss 's admin . She had dyed copper hair and a ghostly pallor . She was in her mid-twenties and lived in El Segundo not too far from me , but she did a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hammond allowed , I suspected she 'd have worn studded black leather every day , black fingernail polish , probably gotten everything pierced . Even parts of the body you do n't want to think about getting pierced . Then again , maybe she already did . I did n't want to know . " Does this mean you did n't get me abagel ? " I said . " I was on my way down there when Mike called . From Mumbai . " " What 's he doing in India ? He told me he 'd be back in the office today for a couple of hours before he leaves for the offsite . " " Yeah , well , Eurospatiale 's losing orders all over the place since their plane crashed . " " So Mike 's lined up meetings at Air India instead of coming back here , " I said . " Nice of him to tell me . " Mike Zorn was an executive vice president and the program manager in charge of building our brand-new wide-bodied passenger jet , the H-880 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people reported to him-engineers and designers and stress analysts and marketing and finance people . But Mike was always selling the hell out of the 880 , which meant he was out of the office far more than he was in . So he 'd hired a chief assistant-me-to make sure everything ran smoothly . Crack the whip if necessary . His jack-of-all-trades and U.N . translator , since I have enough of an engineering background to talk to the engineers in their own geeky language , talk finance with the money people , talk to the shop floor guys in the assembly plant who distrust the lardasses who sit in the office and keep revising and revising the damned drawings . Zo looked uneasy . " Sorry , he wanted me to tell you , but I kind of forgot . Anyway , the point is , he wants you to get over to Fab . " " When ? " " Like an hour ago . " The fabrication plant was the enormous factory where we were building part of the SkyCruiser . " Why ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't quite get it , but the head QA guy found something wrong with the vertical tail ? And he just like shut down the whole production line ? Like , pulled the switch ? " I groaned . " That 's got to be Marty Kluza . Marty the one-man party . " The lead Quality Assurance inspector at the assembly plant was a famous pain in the ass . But he 'd been at Hammond for fifteen years , and he was awfully good at his job , and if he would n't let a part leave the factory , there was usually a good reason for it . " I do n't know . Anyway , like everyone at headquarters is totally freaking , and Mike wants you to deal with it . Now . " " Shit . " " You still want that bagel ? " Zo said . Chapter Two I raced over in my Jeep . The fabrication plant was only a five-minute walk from the office building , but it was so immense-a quarter of a mile long-you could spend twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the factory floor-I came here maybe every couple of weeks-I was awestruck by the sheer scale . It was an enormous hangar big enough to contain ten football fields . The vaulted ceiling was a hundred feet high . There were miles of catwalks and crane rails . The whole place was like the set of some futuristic sci-fi movie where robots run the world . There were more machines than people . The robotic Automated Guided Vehicle forklift zoomed around silently , carrying huge pallets of equipment and parts in its jaws . The autoclave , basically a pressure cooker , was thirty feet in diameter and a hundred feet long , as big as some traffic tunnels . The automated tape layers were as tall as two men , with spidery legs like the extraterrestrial creature in Alien , extruding yards of shiny black tape . Visitors were always surprised by how quiet it was here . That 's because we rarely used metal anymore-no more clanging and riveting . The SkyCruiser , you see , was 80 percent plastic . Well , not plastic , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then baked at high temperature and pressure . Like Boeing and Airbus and Eurospatiale , we used as much composite as we could get away with because it 's a lot lighter than metal , and the lighter a plane is , the less fuel it 's going to use . Everyone likes to save money on fuel . Unfortunately , the whole process of making planes out of this stuff is sort of a black art . We basically experiment , see what works and what does n't . This does n't sound too reassuring , I know . If you 're a nervous flyer , this is already probably more than you want to know . Also like Boeing and Airbus and the others , we do n't really build our own planes anymore . We mostly assemble them , screw and glue them together from parts built all over the world . But here in Fab , we made exactly one part of the SkyCruiser : an incredibly important part called the vertical stabilizer-what you 'd call the tail . It was five stories high . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by scaffolding . And underneath it I found Martin Kluza , moving a handheld device slowly along the black skin . He looked up with an expression of annoyance . " What 's this , I get the kid ? Where 's Mike ? " " Out of town , so you get me . Your lucky day . " " Oh , great . " He liked to give me a hard time . Kluza was heavyset , around fifty , with a pink face and a small white goatee on his double chin . He had safety glasses on , like me , but instead of a yellow safety helmet , he was wearing an L.A. Dodgers cap . No one dared tell him what to do , not even the director of the plant . " Hey , did n't you once tell me I was the smartest guy in the SkyCruiser Program ? " " Correction : excluding myself , " Marty said . " I stand corrected . So I hear we 've got a problem . " " I believe the word is catastrophe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a video display terminal on a rolling cart , tapped quickly at the keys . A green blob danced across the screen , then a jagged red line slashed through it . " See that red line ? " he said . " That 's the bond line between the skin and the spars , okay ? About a quarter of an inch in . " " Cool , " I said . " This is better than Xbox 360 . Looks like you got a disbond , huh ? " " That 's not a disbond , " he said . " It 's a kissing bond . " " Kissing bond , " I said . " Got ta love that phrase . " That referred to when two pieces of composite were right next to each other , no space between , but were n't stuck together . In my line of work , we say they 're in " intimate contact " but have n't " bonded . " Is that a metaphor or what ? " The C-scan did n't pick up any disbonds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one of them through a shake-table vibe test to check out the flutter and the flex/rigid dynamics , and that 's when I discovered a discrepancy in the frequency signature . " " If you 're trying to snow me with all this technical gobbledygook , it 's not going to work . " He looked at me sternly for a few seconds , then realized I was giving him shit right back . " Fortunately , this new laser-shot peening diagnostic found the glitch . We 're going to have to scrap every single one . " " You ca n't do that , Marty . " " You want these vertical stabilizers flying apart at thirty-five thousand feet with three hundred people aboard ? I do n't think so . " " There 's no fix ? " " If I could figure out where the defect is , yeah . But I ca n't . " " Maybe they were overbaked ? Or underbaked ? " " Landry . " " Contaminants ? " " Landry , you could eat off the floor here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clean room and ruined a whole day 's production ? " " That guy has n't worked here in two years , Landry . " " Maybe you got a bad lot of Hexocyte . " That was the epoxy adhesive film they used to bond the composite skin to the understructure . " The supplier 's got a perfect record on that . " " So maybe someone left the backing paper on . " " On every single piece of adhesive ? No one 's that brain-dead . Not even in this place . " " Will you scan this bar code ? I want to check the inventory log . " I handed him a tag I 'd taken from a roll of Hexocyte adhesive film . He brought it over to another console , scanned it . The screen filled up with a series of dates and temperatures . I walked over to the screen and studied it for a minute or so . " Marty , " I said . " I 'll be back in a few . I 'm going to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wasting your time , " he said .
