<p> From Washington to Florida , the highest-ranking officials of the Washington Nationals felt as helpless as any of the team 's fans late Tuesday night , as the D.C. Council voted down the city 's stadium lease agreement with Major League Baseball , a move that , for a few hours  --  until the Council reconsidered the issue in an emergency session and approved a modified agreement  --  plunged the vagabond franchise back into an unsettling but familiar state of uncertainty . <p> Tony Tavares , the Nationals ' MLB-appointed president and CEO , was watching the council hearing on television at his Washington home with his wife , Betty Ann , when the agreement was voted down , 8-5 , at about 8:40 p.m . <p> " I just shut off the broadcast , " Tavares said yesterday , " and said to my wife , ' That 's it . We 're up in the air again . ' It was n't until later that I got a call from one of our lawyers telling me the lease was going to be approved . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in Washington . " <p> The Washington Nationals lived to see another day , thanks to the Council 's unexpected U-turn . But that is about as far ahead as the franchise is able to look these days . MLB , which owns the Nationals , must approve the city 's modified agreement , and as of yesterday afternoon baseball officials had yet to receive anything from the city to review . <p> " It would be great to move this process along , maybe get an owner in here in time to get established , get to know the team , " said Brian Schneider , the Nationals ' veteran catcher . " Every day we lose is another day that sets us back . " <p> Still , regardless of what comes next , it may be too late to undo the damage that already has been inflicted upon the Nationals during this winter of political hardball in their home city . With the team ready to open its spring training camp next week in Viera , Fla. , the franchise  --  which came to Washington last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal Expos  --  lags far behind most others in terms of marketing , ticket sales and even player acquisitions , and it remains the only franchise in baseball without real , independent ownership . <p> " These are not pleasant circumstances , to say the least , " Tavares said , " but we 've been dealing with unpleasant circumstances for five years . Now , we 're back to uncertainty about our future , which is never helpful . Right now , we could be tying up long-term sponsor relationships . Those are on hold . In normal circumstances , we 'd be selling luxury suites and club seats for the new stadium . We 'd be starting on the naming rights . <p> " It really runs the gamut , and it 's stressful for the people working for us . They do n't know whether to buy a house , or rent . And it does n't help us when we 're trying to recruit people into the front office , or with free agents . " <p> Tavares cited conversations with several agents who told the Nationals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise . <p> Still , if anything , the team 's baseball operations department , which is responsible for the product on the field , has suffered the least from the uncertainty . General Manager Jim Bowden , who helped construct the team that surprised many in baseball by going 81-81 last year and remaining in contention until the season 's final weeks , was given a payroll budget for 2006 of around $60 million , an increase of 20 percent over last year 's figure of around $50 million . <p> Bowden has used that extra money to sign a slew of low-cost players in hopes of boosting the franchise 's depth . Yesterday , in fact , he signed first baseman-catcher Matt LeCroy , previously with the Minnesota Twins , to a one-year deal worth $850,000 . LeCroy , 29 , could back up both Nick Johnson at first base and Schneider at catcher . <p> The Nationals have also sweetened their offer to former Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa , who spent last season with the Baltimore Orioles , changing it from a minor-league deal to a major-league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes the team in spring training  --  in order to make it more palatable to Sosa , who needs 12 more homers to become the fifth member of baseball 's 600-home-run club . <p> The Nationals ' low-ball offer  --  the contract would provide a minimal salary with numerous incentive bonuses  --  probably has more to do with Sosa 's declining skills than with the franchise 's financial shortcomings . <p> " Every GM operates with some financial constraints , and I 'm certain the constraints of every team are different , " said Adam Katz , Sosa 's agent . Katz , however , refused to discuss the negotiations regarding Sosa and the Nationals . <p> Bowden 's one extravagant acquisition this winter was second baseman Alfonso Soriano , in a trade with the Texas Rangers . Although Bowden has long coveted Soriano for his combination of speed and power , this afternoon , in a conference room at the Renaissance Vinoy Hotel in St. Petersburg , Fla. , a team of negotiators representing the Nationals will use Soriano 's career numbers against him in an effort to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 2006 salary  --  the difference between the team 's offer of $10 million and Soriano 's figure of $12 million  --  and team executives say privately there is little hope of reaching an agreement before today 's hearing . For the Nationals , the difference between winning and losing the hearing could be an extra bullpen arm , or some extra cash to play with in trade talks this spring . <p> " It 's a huge number for us , " Bowden acknowledged during a telephone interview from his Viera office . However , Bowden declined to comment when asked how the franchise 's uncertainty has affected his ability to do his job . <p> Meantime , in Washington , the team yesterday put season tickets and mini-plans on sale to the general public , as it continues to seek to convince its 2005 ticket-holders to renew theirs . The team drew more than 2.7 million fans to RFK Stadium in 2005 , ranking 11th out of 30 major league teams in attendance . <p> The Nationals had hoped to ride the momentum of last year 's strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box office this offseason . But Tavares said the team 's renewal rate  --  from its 2005 season-ticket base of around 22,500  --  is between 80 to 85 percent , well shy of the goal of 90 percent , and the Nationals attribute much of that to the political wrangling that filled much of the winter . <p> Additionally , the team has done virtually no advertising locally and likely will not broaden its penetration into the local television market , with perhaps only 90 or so games to be broadcast locally in 2006 . <p> " They wo n't have much more exposure in ' 06 than in ' 05 , and it will probably be the least exposure on TV of any team in baseball , " said one person familiar with the team 's broadcast efforts . <p> " If they had ownership in place , they could be making plans for the future , have a longer-term budget and they could select an owner who has great marketing acumen , " said Marc S. Ganis , chief executive of SportsCorp Ltd. , a Chicago-based sports marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a huge help . " <p> Sometimes , even when the Nationals seek to rise above their humble circumstances , they fail miserably . This week , the team put in a new central telephone system at the office , in order to help alleviate the problem of long hold times for fans seeking tickets or other information . <p> On Monday , the system crashed , giving callers  --  some of who , no doubt , were potential ticket buyers  --  no way to reach the Nationals for almost 24 hours . <p> Staff writer Thomas Heath contributed to this report .
