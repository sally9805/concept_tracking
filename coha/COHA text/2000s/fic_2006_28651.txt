Chapter One Halloween week in Hadley-by-Hudson . Senior year of high school . Nine in the evening . Had enough sentence fragments ? My English teacher said they are a weakness of mine . But I still like them . They generate pace . You want pace ? I 'll give you pace . You want weird ? Stick around , my friend . The air pinching colder . Winter coming on fast , winding up to clobber us . A month from now it will be bitter , bitter , and you can feel the coming chill in the north wind . You can smell it in the rust and smoke of the colored leaves . Stock up on the Kleenex . Nostril-clogging chill . Wind the scarves tight . Get out last winter 's mittens . Halloween decorations going up on doors and windows . Black cats crouching . Witches soaring on broomsticks . This is gon na get weird fast , but not the way you think . Here 's what I thought . I thought I was living in the most normal little town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy could have . First name ? Jack . How 's that for normal ? Last name ? Danielson . Pretty standard stuff , huh ? Occupation ? High school senior . Hobbies ? Chicks , flicks , and fast cars , roughly in that order . Oh , and I left out sports . Very important . When you 're a guy in a town like Hadley with a tough public high school , it helps to be a jock . So I 'm lucky that way . Six feet two . Muscles . Starting running back on the football team . Straw-colored hair , piercing blue eyes , andabove-average brain power , except when I do something really stupid . Did I mention a winning smile ? Winning smile is often directed at one P. J. Peters . The " P " could have been for " pretty " as they come . Or " pert . " Or " perspicacious . " Look that one up in the dictionary , my friend . Sometimes " pretentious . " Always " pleasing . " The " J " could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always testing each other . Or " joker . " No one could make me laugh like P.J. Or " jubilant " when she accomplished something really important . So we 're at the Hadley Diner on a night we 've both accomplished something important . P.J. has won a local art contest for a pen-and-ink drawing of her great-grandmother , who is ninety-four . There were adult artists in the competition , so for a high schooler to win is pretty hot stuff . I just rushed for three hundred and forty yards . New school record . New league record . Not a bad day 's work . We defeated our archrival school . Guys are giving me high fives . Slapping me on the back . " Way to go , Jack . You the man . You the one . " Neon signs flashing out front . DINER . IF YOU 'RE HUNGRY , WE 'RE OPEN . Red leather seats . P.J. nestled close , reminding me not to get a swelled head . " You 're still a bozo , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's have a little respect , Miss da Vinci . " A man walks by our table . Tall . Gangly . Adam 's apple sticking out of throat like it wants to be plucked . He 's just eaten . Heading for the door . Passes all the high school kids . Does n't glance at us . That 's curious ' cause we 're making mucho noise . Maybe he does n't like kids . Then he turns his head and looks . Right at me . For a half second . Not at anyone else . Just me . Like he knows me . And I see his eyeballs roll around in his head . Now they look like normal eyes . Now the pupils disappear . Something flashes . Like a flashbulb . Or a computer scanner . A sudden burst of white light that turns silvery . Then the light is gone and I blink and he 's gone , too . " Did you see that ? " I ask P.J. " What ? " " That guy 's eyes ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was here a second ago . His eyes got weird . " " I think you 'd better lay off mind-bending drugs . " Then we 're out in my car , parked at the lookout . Hudson River flowing by . Big autumn moon hanging in the sky like a swollen sex gland . I 'm thinking this is the night . But P.J. has other ideas . " Come on , " I plead . " There 'll never be a better time . " " No . " " Why not ? " " I 'm not ready . " " P.J. , you 're ready . And you 're killing me . " " You look pretty healthy . " " Yeah , I scored four touchdowns today . " " So ? " " It 's fate . This is my day to score . " Wrong thing to say . Mood starting to fracture big-time . " So you 're comparing my virginity to a football field ? " " No , P.J. , I was just joking- " " But you view our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base , you want me to spread my legs like football goalposts ? Is that it ? " " P.J. , it 's a beautiful night . We 're seniors . I love you . The guys on the team give me all kinds of grief- " " That we do n't go all the way ? You talk to them about us ? " Again , wrong thing to say . " No . Yes . Never . But- " End of story . " Put it away . Back in your pants . " " But , P.J. , there 'll never be a better time . " " Put that sucker away and let 's go home . There 'll be lots of better times . I promise . Soon . " " Have you ever heard of blue balls ? It 's a medical condition . Can be terminal . " She gives me a sweet kiss on the side of the cheek . " You are such a pathetic dumb puppy . " " What is that supposed to mean ? " " There . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 'll never know what I suffer . " I take her home . We kiss . Gets intense . A curtain moves . P.J. 's dad peers out . I wave . P.J. waves to him and gets out of my car . I sit there and watch her walk to her house and disappear inside as the big front door shuts . She 's so beautiful . So smart . So much fun . She 'll pick her moment . Girls know about these things . They operate on instinct . Just be patient , Jack . I drive home with my blue balls . Dad is waiting there . And Mom . He does n't look happy . " So I heard about the game . Congratulations . " " Thanks , Dad . It was great . " " Maybe too great , " he says . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Dad paces . Mom stands still . Both look worried . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " I try again . " Am I missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not good to stand out too much , " Dad says . " You show people up . Make enemies . People get jealous . " " Who 's getting jealous ? " I ask . " This was one of the best nights of my life . Everyone at the diner was slapping me on the back . Nobody was jealous . Everybody was happy for me . Except you . " My voice getting louder . " What kind of fatherly advice are you handing out here ? Fail intentionally ? Do n't try my best ? " Dad looks pained . Mom chimes in . " It 's just better to fit in sometimes , " she says . " Your father loves you , Jack . He wants what 's best for you . " " And that 's why he tells me not to do my best on math tests ? Not to do my best on science projects ? Not to set records in track ? Not to score too many points in football games ? It sounds like he wants what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was on TV , " Dad says . " Yeah . I saw it at the diner . Local sports news . Why exactly is that a problem ? " " Exposure , " Dad says . " Attracts bad elements . Did you see anything tonight ? " " What kind of anything are we talking about ? " " Anything strange , " he says . " Nutty high school sports fans . Sex-crazed groupies . Whatever . " He 's trying to make a joke out of it . " Now that you 're a big shot , you 'd better keep an eye out . " " No , I did n't see anything strange , " I tell him . Until I got home , that is . And my parents gave my big night the body slam . For no good reason . But I do n't say this . I just think it . Then I remember . " Yeah , there was something weird . " They both look kind of interested . " I was at the diner with P.J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a second his eyes disappeared and something flashed . But nobody else saw it , so I must have been dreaming- " Dad grips me by the shoulders . " Did he say anything ? " " Who ? " " The man ? " " No . " " But he looked right at you ? " " Yes ? What 's the big deal- " " How tall was he ? " " Very tall . Maybe an inch taller than you . " " When you saw the flash , did it change color ? " " Kind of , " I say . " White to silvery . Do you know this man ? Dad , what 's going on ? " He 's holding me tightly , freaking me out . " We 're gon na go for a drive , " he tells my mom . " Now ? " I ask . " It 's after eleven . Where are we going ? The police ? I do n't get it . " " Go , " Mom says . Which is weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom is not a touchy-feely kind of mom . " Goodbye , Jack , " she whispers . For a second I think there 's a tear sliding down her cheek . " Will somebody tell me what the hell 's going on ? " I request . " In the car , " Dad says . And he throws on a jacket and marches out into the cold darkness , so I follow him . After all , he is my dad . Chapter Two Two-lane highway . Dark and empty . Curves and straightaways above the mile-wide band of black-rippling Hudson . Full moon flashing in the sky like a cautionary sign : dANGER AHEAD . OBEY SPEED LIMIT . SLOW DOWN ! Dad going faster . Way over the legal fifty-five . Pedal to the metal . Sixty . Seventy . " I 'm not your father , " he says . " What ? Dad , slow down ! You 're going to kill us ! " " Listen to me , Jack . I 'm not ' Dad . ' No , do n't argue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , I do love you , but I am not your father . " Something in his face . In his tone . Maybe it 's the speed of the car . I believe it even though I 'm still fighting against it . " This is a joke , right ? Some sort of test ? Game ? " " No joke . No test . No game . " He 's driving like a pro . I 've never seen him even push a speed limit in his life . Dad 's a gentle guy . Meek . Law-abiding . Cautious . Where did he learn this ? " Dad , are you saying Mom was cheating ... ? " " I 'm not ' Dad . ' Mom is not your mother . Not me . Not her . None of it . Damn it , hold on ! " Tires screech . Car nearly flies into an oak tree . I prepare to die . Dad wins the battle with the road . Drives on . My fingers are gripping the armrest . I can barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm adopted ? " " No , " he said . " It 's more complicated than that . No time to explain . That light you saw in the diner turned silvery ? " " Yes , but who cares- " " You were marked . That 's how they 're finding us . " " Who ? " " I need to unmark you , " Dad says . Driving with one hand now . At this speed it 's suicide , but he 's doing it . Rooting around in a black bag on the seat . Where did that bag come from ? Pulls out a little metal cube . Camera ? Never saw it before . Highpitched whine . Greenish flash . Strange sensation all over my body . As if an outer layer of skin is being removed , tugged off , the way you peel off sunburn . It 's painful . Very . I yell . " Sorry , " he says . " It 's your only chance . " " Chance to do what ? " " We are counting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are our beacon of hope . " " Hope for what ? " " There they are ! " he gasps . " They came so quickly . " I look around . Do n't see anyone . Dad jerks the wheel . Car skids wildly and jackknifes off the highway onto a narrow road . Scratch that , not a road . More like a path . Dark . Bumpy . Not well paved . Also not lighted . But apparently not dark enough for Dad 's purposes because he switches off his lights . We career forward into Stygian blackness . Look that up , my friend , but not right now . No time for anything now . Except to hold on . My God , is it steep ! Are we still on the path ? How can this car not turn over ? " DAD , YOU 'RE GOING TO KILL US . STOP ! " But he 's looking back . Through the rear window . Half-turned . So I look back , too . Lights behind us . Not cars . Motorcycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ca n't outrun them , " Dad says . " Got to stand and fight . " FULL BRAKE . Bone-jolting torque . Screeching grinding howl as if the car is a wounded beast and we 're inside it . Stench of burning rubber . Car spinning wildly . Rolls over . Never been in a car that rolled over before . Not fun . Then everything stops . Dad clambers out . Helps me . Something is burning . In the flame I see him clearly . Is this my gentle , caring dad ? He 's got a gun in one hand . Binoculars in the other . Scanning the road . " Go , " he says to me . " Now . Go . " " Where ? " I ask . " The river , " he says . " Jake 's Marina . There 's a boat at the end of pier three . Key under the cushion on the driver 's chair . Go now . " " I 'm not going anywhere , " I say , scared out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening , my place is here with you . " He puts his hand on my shoulder . Bends and kisses me on the forehead . For one second he 's Dad again . How I will cherish that kiss . Then he looks at me . Eyes burning with purpose . " Listen , son . There 's no time for me to explain this . Everything you believe is the opposite of what is true . I am not your father . Mom is not your mother . Your friends and schoolmates were for you to hide among . They go through life without purpose . You have a purpose . You are our beacon of hope . You must survive . And they are coming here now to kill you . " He fires the gun . Wide , sweeping tracer pattern . Not bullets . I do n't think lasers . But something searing and hissing and deadly erupts out of the muzzle . " Go find the boat , " he says . " I 'll hold them off . Get away . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there 's no way you can make me go . So just forget it . " He looks at me . " No time to argue . " He lowers the gun . And shoots off his own foot ! Intentionally ! I see him gasp , and he buckles and almost goes down . His toes are gone . Half the foot is gone . Blood . Bone . He looks back at me and raises the gun to his head . " Next shot I blow out my brains . Do you want to see it , or will you go ? " I take a step away . Do n't even know what I 'm doing now . Mind roiled with fear and confusion . " Go ! " he says . " For years I 've told you to hide your abilities . Now you must use them all . Fly , my boy , fly like the wind . And take this . " He hands me a long knife . Incoming fire rakes the ground in front of us . A rock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's one thing I have always been able to do . Fastest runner in my class . In my grade . In my school . In my town . In my county . I 'm off downhill , arms pumping , legs churning , while behind me I hear more incoming fire and I think I hear a shrill scream of agony . Dad ? Do n't think it . Just run . Through brambles . Sliding down rocks . Tumbling down sandy cliffs . Even motorcycles ca n't make it down this . To the shores of the Hudson . Two hours ago I was making out with P.J. with this river providing the romantic setting . Now I 'm running along the clay bank , feet sticking into two inches of muck . Look back . Fire on the hillside . Look forward . Jake 's Marina . All dark and quiet . Scale the fence . Barbs at the top . Swing over and do n't get stuck . Boats rocking on the night tide . Wavelets breaking on wharf logs . Minnows in moonlight . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then another one . Run past pier one . Past pier two . To pier three . Fifty yards long . Half a football field . I dash down it . This is my day to score . I fly like the wind . No one can run this fast . Black shape running faster . Gaining on me . Silver blade whizzes by my ear . Throwing knife ? I see the black boat at the very end . Sleek craft . Built for speed . I leap to the deck . Run to the driver 's chair . Rip off the cushion . There 's the key . Stick it in . Switch it on . Deafening roar . This thing 's got power ! Boat starts to move . Then stops . Forgot to cast off mooring rope . Dark form leaps from the pier at me . Black robe flaps in wind . I see it coming . Flying at me . Are those teeth or claws ? No time to think . I dodge to one side and raise the knife Dad gave me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lower my arm in horror and creature slides off knife , sinks into river , and Hudson swallows it . That 's the good news . Bad news is more black shapes coming fast . I cut mooring rope with knife . Jump to chair . Look back as I hit gas . Two black forms leap out at me . I stand and hurl knife at them . Roar . Boat explodes out into river . I glance back again . Two black ghouls hurtle over water and then lose momentum and altitude till they splash down . Into the drink . The rest of the shadowy figures collect on the end of the pier like a frustrated evil army . I 've made it . But why ? For what ? Where am I going ? Everything I love has been left behind . I steer the boat out into the middle of the river and head south . I put my head in my hands . And I weep for my father and my mother and P.J. and my teammates and for everything that was but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... )
