Sometimes you want a DVD to catch up with a movie you missed . Sometimes you want to see how time has treated a cultural artifact that touched you the first time around . And sometimes you need one to keep the kids occupied for 98 minutes . Whatever the reason , here are our critics ' picks for the best of the current crop . <P> DONNIE DARKO <P> A TEEN-ANGST science- fiction movie that actually deserves the tag " cult classic , " this 2001 space oddity earned less than $1 million in its first release , but has spawned an avid following . <P> Bright , baffled Donnie ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) has to save the world , which , a 6-ft. rabbit informs him , will end in 28 days . Writer-director Richard Kelly populates his suburban Middlesex with nearly as many strange creatures and daunting tasks as Tolkien did his Middle-earth . With an extra 20 minutes and a probing chat track with Kelly and fellow director Kevin Smith , this beautiful , elusive tale of tangent universes and distant technologies is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has to . As Donnie 's friend Gretchen tells him , " You 're weird . " When he says , " Sorry , " she replies , " No , that was a compliment . " From us too .  --  By Richard Corliss <P> MURDER ONE : SEASON ONE <P> BEFORE THERE was 24 , there was One . In 1995- ' 96 , Steven Bochco 's Murder One took a full season to tell a single story : the trial of a famous actor ( Jason Gedrick ) for the murder of a 15-year-old girl . The experiment was bracing , intense and a ratings failure . Maybe , in the autumn of O.J. Simpson 's acquittal , it was hard to sell a celebrity murder story in which the high-priced defense team , headed by no-nonsense Ted Hoffman ( Daniel Benzali ) , was more sympathetic than police and prosecutors . Maybe audiences were n't ready for a serial format . But One is made for the DVD era : watching the 23 " chapters " consecutively , you can better appreciate both the potboiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think of it as practice for the Michael Jackson trial .  --  By James Poniewozik <P> BAMBI : PLATINUM EDITION <P> WALT DISNEY HAD a cunning formula : use the highest illustrative art to make horror movies for kids . Next to Pinocchio ( play hooky and you will morph into a donkey ) , Bambi is the most artful and potent  --  and the scariest  --  of Walt 's early features . After the youngsters have watched a movie in which a child sees its mother shot and killed , the grownups can stay around to see deleted scenes and ancient storyboards . Later , the kids can play the eight interactive games on the DVD.  --  R.C. <P> PICCADILLY <P> TALKIES MAY HAVE made them obsolete , but silent films went out in style , as this 1929 drama from German director E.A. Dupont proves . It 's the All About Eve fable , with an exotic youngster ( Anna May Wong ) replacing an older star ( Gilda Gray ) . Wong , the one Chinese-American movie star in Holly-wood 's first half-century , exudes the toxic perfume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Gray , the ostensible star ) look frowsy . Like Wong , this terrific movie still has heat and a hard luster.  --  R.C. <P> RAGING BULL
