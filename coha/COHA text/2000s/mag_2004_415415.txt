As Fox News Channel battled for victory in this summer 's ratings war , EW was there in the trenches . An exclusive report BY JOSH ROTTENBERG // NEW YORK , AUGUST 30-AT 10 A.M. ON DAY 1 OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL Convention , all the major players-delegates , politicians , reporters , lobbyists , pundits , protesters , cops , and right-leaning celebrities like Bo Derek , Ron Silver , Angie Harmon , and Don King-are in place and ready for the big show . In Madison Square Garden , the convention organizers are putting the finishing touches on the stage , testing the sound system , honing the talking points-doing everything possible to try to ensure that this convention convinces whoever 's watching that John Kerry is a flipflopping , weak-on-defense Massachusetts liberal and that , for the sake of the republic , President George W. Bush must be reelected this fall . Fifteen blocks uptown , at the headquarters of the Fox News Channel , a computer animator named Gary Telfer is doing everything possible to ensure that viewers will tune in and stay tuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set to thundering music as part of the network 's effort to amp up the razzle-dazzle factor of its convention coverage . " Right now , I 'm working on the interior , " Telfer says , rotating a detailed digital image of the arena on his screen , as absorbed in his virtual world as any 9-year-old Xbox jockey . Telfer spent three years as a technical director at Disney , where he could work for days on end on some small motion of , say , Tarzan 's hand . At Fox , he gets to reconstruct the Garden inside and out and then have the entire thing spin around like a flying saucer and shoot off light rays and stars . Not to mention all the animations he 's worked on for the war in Iraq : tanks blowing up , insurgents taking down helicopters with RPG 's . Pretty cool stuff . Some 15,000 members of the media are training their gazes on this four-day convention , roughly three for every delegate , all trying to squeeze some news out of an event that has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundreds of media outlets gathered here casts as long a shadow as the Fox News Channel . As this year 's bitterly contested presidential race goes into overdrive , the network finds itself at the roiling center of American political liferight where it has wanted to be ever since Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch launched his 24-hour cable news channel on Oct. 7 , 1996 . Few back then took the fledgling network very seriously . Even before it hit the air , senior reporter Eric Shawn remembers other journalists scoffing at the very idea of Fox doing news : " They just laughed : " Fox ? Hey , Bart Simpson 's here ! ' ' " No one 's laughing now . Fox News has shot to the top of the cablenews ratings heap with brash packaging that combines the adrenalinepumping theatrics of Monday Night Football-the flashy graphics , the whooshing and booming sound effects-with the knock-downdrag-out combativeness of talk radio . Starting out with a budget onethird that of CNN , chairman and CEO Roger Ailes , a former Republican media consultant , recognized that instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fox 5 ) , he could just put provocative personalities like Bill O'Reilly in front of a camera and let them hold forth on the day 's hot-button issues . With each shock to the national nervous system-the Monica Lewinsky scandal , Columbine , the 2000 election , 9/11-the network picked up more and more viewers , and in January 2002 Fox finally overtook CNN in ratings . While Fox famously touts its coverage as " Fair &; Balanced , " critics like Al Franken and Michael Moore and films like Outfoxed have painted the network as a propaganda machine for the right . " Where does the criticism come from ? " asks Fox 's Sean Hannity . " The Clinton News Network ? I do n't pay much attention to that . " Still , wherever a Fox reporter goes , the bias question is the 800-pound elephant in the room . " The reason Fox News is winning in the ratings has nothing to do with ideology , " O'Reilly insists . " We are simply more fun to watch . In all situations , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Warner , EWs parent company ) reaches a larger potential audience of 3 million more homes , Fox viewers tend to stick with the channel for longer periods of time-to the point that Fox executives had to make the logo in the lower left-hand corner of the screen ( called a " bug " ) spin , because hardcore fans found it was burning into their TV sets . In industry terms , this degree of viewer loyalty is referred to as " intensity . " If you had to sum up Fox News in a single word , you could do worse . The intensity all came together during the Republican convention , when the network made television-news history by beating not only CNN and MSNBC but also all three of the broadcast networks in the ratings . ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY was there for both conventions , granted unprecedented behind-the-scenes access by Fox News to its anchors , reporters , techies , and other groundlings . Our goal : to understand how Fox turns even the most predictable news into compelling entertainment . This is what we saw . Donkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * * * * 4:15 PM THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION IS JUST KICKING off , and in a makeshift studio on the roof of Boston Harbor hotel , Joan Jett is perched in a chair next to Bill O'Reilly , looking like she 's been set up on the weirdest blind date of her life . At 43 , the singer still cuts a forbidding figure-spiky hair , leather pants , tattoos-but she 's clearly nervous . She 's well aware of O'Reilly 's fire-breathing interviewing style , so she 's just hoping to get in some quick plugs for her most recent album , Naked , and her preferred candidate , Kerry , and live to put another dime in the jukebox , baby . With a disarming smile , O'Reilly tries to put her at ease . " Just be yourself , " he purrs . Then , as soon as the cameras are rolling , he 's up in her grill with questions about Linda Ronstadt and " dopey Michael Moore " and why she previously supported the " off-the-wall " former Vermont governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explains later . " Engage the audience right off the top . " In many people 's minds , the truculent , 6-foot-4 O'Reilly is the living embodiment of the Fox ethos . His one-man terror dome of punditry , The O'Reilly Factor , is the network 's highest-rated primetime show , routinely pulling in double the audience of CNN 's kinder , gentler Lam/ King Live . Outside of the Bush administration , O'Reilly is the conservative ( he would say independent ) liberals most love to hate . Needless to say , the Democratic convention is not exactly his turf , but so far no one has insulted him to his face : " I 'm big , and I do n't look like I 'd really brook that , " he says . " And I would n't . " O'Reilly , who bills his show as a " no-spin zone , " sees political conventions as just a lot of " bloviating . " He vows he wo n't allow a single speech to preempt his broadcast at either one . " Somebody going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - forget it , " he scowls . " I do n't care who it is . I have better things to do . Unless Jesus comes on-then I 'll probably cut away . " JULY 26 * * * * * * * * * * 9:05 PM AS JIMMY CARTER STEPS UP TO THE PODIUM BELOW , HOWARD Dean enters the cramped Fox skybox inside the FleetCenter and takes the guest 's chair for an appearance on Hannity &; Colmes . The second-highest-rated prime-time show on Fox , Hannity &; Colmes hews to the familiar right-versus-left slugfest format , pitting Sean Hannity , a broad-shouldered Reagan conservative who looks like the captain of the lacrosse team , against Alan Colmes , a slouchy , bespectacled Clinton liberal who looks like the captain of the math team . The standard rap against such shows is that they 're WWE matches for political junkies , but Colmes , for one , is fine with that . " We 're not doing PBS here , " he says . Dean 's passionate oratorical style ( rrraaaaghh ! ) makes him an ideal guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of softballs from Colmes , Hannity , who 's stationed out on the convention floor , engages Dean in a debate over whether there was any link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein in the run-up to the Iraq war . " You should watch Outfoxed , " Dean says , with a sly leprechaun grin . " It 's a great movie that says why people like you say things like that on Fox News . " A minute later , Hannity ends the interview and cuts to a few minutes of Carter 's speech . Thorn Bird , the executive producer of Fox 's convention coverage , gives Dean a quick handshake and thanks him for the appearance " even with the Outfoxed comment . " He shakes his head . " I can only imagine Sean 's face , " he says wanly . " It was n't Sean I was thinking of , " Dean says , heading for the exit . " It was Rupert . " JULY 26 * * * * * * * * * * 4:15 PM WHEN FOX CORRESPONDENT ALISYN CAMEROTA HEARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worst . Early reports warned of violent clashes with police officers , possible acts of terrorism directed against the media , and hundreds of arrests . " You should have seen me yesterday morning , " she says over lunch in one of the Fox trailers outside the FleetCenter . " I was looking in my closet , like , " What should I wear for excrement being thrown at me ? ' ' " What Camerota found instead was " 200 of the most law-abiding , downright civilized anarchists anybody 's ever seen . " In other words , not the best material for television . There was , however , one brief fistfight between a couple of protesters that her cameraman caught on tape , and that flurry of violence became the teaser to the story that went on the air . Camerota admits this is slightly misleading , but she makes no apologies . " We do n't do silly , sweepslike teases : " Your mattress is harboring ferocious animals ! ' " she says . " You just choose the juiciest 10 seconds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for the two-minute explanation of what went on . " The if-it-bleeds-it-leads principle has been around since journalism was born . But in a 24-hour-news world , the hunger for easily digestible hooks and sound bites has helped foster a disturbing superficiality in American politics . If news cameras had been on hand for the Lincoln-Douglas debates and Lincoln had busted out with a highpitched , red-faced scream , there might be a different guy on the $5 bill . Marty Ryan , Fox 's executive producer of political programming , says the challenge is to balance the gotcha hooks with more in-depth coverage of the issues : " The picture of Kerry in the goofy NASA outfit or the Teresa Heinz Kerry " shove it " comment-those are moments you want to seize on . But you ca n't let them overshadow the substance . Over the next couple of days , there will be more analysis of Kerry 's speech than whether he wore the bunny costume . " The reality , though , is that like any television venture , Fox bows at the altar of Nielsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This explains why , outside of campaign politics and the war in Iraq , the biggest story on Fox during the convention has been the disappearance of a pregnant woman named Lori Hacking . " Can the argument be made that we 're looking for ratings in a crime story that does n't have a lot of national importance ? " asks Fox anchor Shepard Smith . " Yeah , you can make that argument . You can also make the argument that people decide the kind of news they want and we go cover it . Which is the chicken and which is the egg ? " JULY 27 * * * * * * * * * * 8:25 PM A BURLY GUARD STANDS AT THE DOOR OF THE FOX SKYBOX , blocking a crush of people hoping to catch a glimpse of Ben Affleck , who 's appearing on The O'Reilly Factor . Affleck is not the only big draw on tonight 's show ; O'Reilly will also be running an interview he taped yesterday with Michael Moore , a Godzilla-versus-Megalon showdown that will help make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire convention . O'Reilly tends to be gentle with celebrity guests ( he wound up being nice to Jett ) , and Affleck is no exception . After a civilized discussion of the war in Iraq and President Bush 's economic policy , O'Reilly suggests Affleck might have a future in politics . " I respect you , " he says . " You 're not bomb-throwing . " After Affleck and his entourage exit the skybox , O'Reilly talks with the control room : " All I want is for this to translate into ratings , " he says . " I do n't care who comes in , what they do-it does n't matter . And if J. Lo were still in the picture , she would have been in here too . " JULY 29 * * * * * * * * * * 9:20 PM THE CLIMAX IS APPROACHING-THE MOMENT JOHN KERRY WILL take the stage to accept his party 's nomination-and in the Fox skybox , chief political anchor Brit Hume is playing solitaire on his laptop . With his regular stable of pundits-Mara Liasson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his right , Hume , who 's already read an advance copy of Kerry 's speech , seems to be only half listening to the proceedings at the podium . Instead , he 's checking the sports scores ( " Baltimore beat the Yankees 9 to 1 , " he announces ) , scanning the crowd with binoculars , chiming in with the occasional wisecrack . When Alexandra Kerry introduces her father with a story about how he once used an oar to rescue the family hamster from drowning , Hume smirks : " And he beat the hamster to death with it . " Having covered politics for more than 30 years , Hume seems a tad jaded . Following a series of introductions , Kerry takes the stage to the strains of Brace Springsteen 's " No Surrender , " salutes the audience , and begins , " Fm John Kerry and I 'm reporting for duty . " The crowd goes nuts . Hume limply puts his hand to his forehead , mocking Kerry 's gesture . " That was not what you 'd call a crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerry 's speech reaches its crescendo , Hume looks at his watch . " This is where the speech needs to be over , " he says . He looks at Kerry 's image on a monitor and frowns . " He looks ashy . " Kerry ends his speech , and a blizzard of confetti and balloons cascades from the rafters . Everyone in the skybox watches in silence as the Fox cameras cut between images of Kerry and John Edwards and sweeping vistas of the delegates cheering on the convention floor-what are referred to in the business as " beauty shots . " Hume puts on his game face , spins his index finger in the air , and says , " Let 's go . " Without referring to a single note , he proceeds to give an eloquent and incisive wrap-up of the speech . Finally , with a quick thank you to the crew , Hume takes off his mike and heads out the door , joining the throngs that are beginning to leave the FleetCenter , like a crowd filing out of a rock concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 * * * * * * * * * * 4:05PM FOR TWO DAYS INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION , FOX 'S on-air personalities have been treated like stars : posing for snapshots with delegates and signing autographs . Last night , as Sean Hannity struggled to make his way through an adoring throng , another Fox employee noted , " He 's like Tom Cruise to these people . " Outside the convention , it 's a different story . At the moment , 500 or so protesters are gathered at News Corp . headquarters , shouting anti-Fox slogans and beating drums . A few wear masks of Bill O'Reilly and Brit Hume . " The more you watch , the less you know ! " the crowd chants in unison , brandishing signs that read " Faux News " and " Fox Hates Freedom . " A reporter from Fox News Radio approaches some demonstrators to interview them and gets spat on . On the other side of the barricades , a few dozen Fox employees watch with expressions of bemusement . " Okay , you 're right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 5 o'clock hour , anchor John Gibson 's news program , The Big Story , features a segment about protesters around the city that presents them in a not particularly flattering light . A woman in a bizarre costume rambles incoherently about how she 's protesting the fact that there 's " no specific diagnosis for 9/11 cough " and , in a clip that will be in heavy rotation over the next few days , a man ( not a protester , as it turns out ) is shown beating a plainclothes cop unconscious . The reporter , Heather Nauert , points out that most of the hundreds of thousands of protesters have been peaceful . But , for many Fox viewers at least , that Rodney King-esque image of violence will be the one that sticks in their memory . AUG. 31 * * * * * * * * * * 9:43PM DEEP IN THE FOX HEADQUARTERS , 14 PEOPLE ARE GATHERED in the control room to handle live coverage of tonight 's featured speeches by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , the Bush twins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve center of Fox 's convention coverage , with 80-odd monitors showing live feeds from a dozen cameras arrayed around the Garden and each of the other cable-news and major broadcast channels . It 's like NASA mission control , only with images of Schwarzenegger 's giant head splashed across the screens instead of the cosmos . At Fox , as at the other networks , those responsible for packaging the live coverage have received advance copies of the speeches . From the moment the Governator takes the stage , director Vinny Arbogast begins calling audibles for appropriate crowd reaction shots to each likely applause line . seeing that there 's a line coming up that references John Wayne , Arbogast directs the cameras to pan to a group of Texas delegates wearing white cowboy hats . When Schwarzenegger mentions the war in Iraq , the screen cuts to a man-possibly the only one at the entire convention-who is wearing a turban . And when he stabs his finger and delivers what will be the best-remembered line of his speech , " Do n't be economic girlymen , " the Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Schwarzeneggers speech , the Bush twins , Barbara and Jenna , take the stage and deliver a giggly , jokey introduction to their mother . On one monitor , Hume can be seen in the Fox skybox burying his head in his hands . In the control room , someone mutters , " How many shots do you think they did before they went out there ? " SEPT. 2 * * * * * * * * * * 9:10 PM JUST MOMENTS BEFORE GOING ON THE AIR TO START THE PREgame show for President Bush 's acceptance speech , Hume spritzes himself with hairspray . " Does my hair look lacquered ? " he asks . After a speech by New York governor George Pataki that Hume , off camera , deems " horrible , " Bush takes the stage . Hume listens for a while , underlining his copy of the speech , then begins playing solitaire on his laptop and checking his e-mail . As Bush details his agenda for a second term , conservative pundit Fred Barnes sighs . " Check the baseball scores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Boston 4 , Anaheim 3 , " Hume reports . " Which of these proposals are actually new ? " Hume asks . The pundits shuffle some papers . The consensus is pretty much none . Finally , at a few minutes past 11 , Bush finishes his speech , the balloons drop , and the music blares . Hume and his panel , clearly weary from the week , do their wrap-up , pointing out that the speech offered nothing especially new , but judging it and the convention largely a success . Then it 's over . Time for the anonymous cleanup crews to begin the thankless work of returning the Garden to its usual , blessedly apolitical business of sports and entertainment . But the news , of course , never stops . At midnight , Kerry is set to deliver a stinging rejoinder to the attacks at the convention on his fitness to be Commander-in-Chief , and Fox will be live in Ohio to cover it . New job figures will be coming out in the morning . A hostage crisis at a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces will continue to battle Iraqi insurgents . And then there 's Hurricane Frances , bearing down on Florida . On the Fox News screen it 's a giant , angry , red monster , looking like the hell storm of the century .
