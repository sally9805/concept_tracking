Six days later . . . " What am I to do , Oliver ? " Miss Fiona Fairchild paced the width of her cousin 's parlor and ignored the amused , or perhaps bemused , expression on his face . Fiona and her sisters had arrived at Oliver 's home a scant hour ago accompanied by the ContessaOrsetti , who had graciously agreed to chaperone them on their journey from Italy . She was traveling to England anyway and said it was certainly no bother . Aunt Edwina had greeted the party with an enthusiasm that quite warmed Fiona 's heart and provided a significant measure of relief as well . For one thing , Aunt Edwina was thankfully nothing like the contessa , who could be both overbearing and presumptuous . For another , her aunt and cousin had had very little warning as to their arrival and it had been more than a dozen years since they 'd last seen one another . After sending the contessa on her way , Aunt Edwina had spirited the younger girls off to settle them in their accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cousin Oliver to return home . His greeting had been just as warm as his mother 's , but Fiona had had no time for idle pleasantries . In truth , she had no time to waste at all . She had a crisis of immense proportions confronting her and Oliver might well be her only salvation . " I refuse to marry a man I 've never seen , let alone met , and an American at that . He would probably wish to live in his own country and I have spent far too many years away from England already . This is my home and I have missed it more than I can say . " Oliver leaned casually against the fireplace mantel and studied her . " But you are not averse to marriage in and of itself ? " " Of course not . I wish to marry . Whatever would I do if I did not marry ? I am rather a good match , you know . " She turned to him and ticked the points off on her fingers . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an excellent hostess . I speak three languages fluently and several others adequately . And the mirror tells me , as have any number of suitors , that I am pretty as well . " " You are not as . . . round and speckled as you were as a child , " Oliver murmured . " You have turned out nicely . Quite nicely . " " Surprisingly so . " She grinned with the satisfaction of a woman who was indeed pleased with the way she 'd turned out . " Thank you , cousin . " Her smile vanished . " What am I to do ? " Oliver 's brows drew together . " I can not believe Uncle Alfred would leave you in such a position . " " He was , unfortunately , doing what he thought was best for me . He had encouraged me to marry for years before he fell ill . " " I assume there were offers ? " Oliver 's gaze traveled over her in an appreciative manner . She was well aware of precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appealingly lush , hair that had deepened from a bright , almost orange color to a rich mahogany , intelligent green eyes that tilted upward slightly at the corners and a porcelain complexion marred only by an annoying smattering of pale freckles across the bridge of her nose that men oddly enough seemed to find enchanting . Fiona Fairchild had become a true beauty and she well knew it . Why , had n't men compared her to a Renaissance painting ? Still , she could be as ugly as sin , for all it mattered . " Yes , of course . " She waved away his comment . " Aside from the aforementioned attributes , I am heir to a significant fortune . At least I was . When Father realized he would not recover . . . " A wave of sadness passed through her and she ignored it . She had mourned for her father upon his death nearly four months ago , and would mourn and miss him for the rest of her days , but at the moment she had the pressing matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider . " He took matters into his own hands . " In spite of his urgings , Father felt my failure to wed was in part his fault . It was n't , of course . I simply never met a man with whom I should wish to spend the rest of my days . " She shrugged . " You must understand that after my stepmother died , I took over her duties in regards to running the household , acting as Father 's hostess and helping with my stepsisters . " " There are three , are n't there ? And two are twins ? " Fiona nodded . " And I could not care for them more than if they were my own flesh and blood , which in itself compounds my dilemma . Father knew if I had only myself to consider I would never marry a man I had not met . " " What would you do with your life , then ? " Oliver asked mildly . " I can not see you becoming a governess . " " Nor can I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's companion or anything else of that nature . I would probably do exactly what I have done . " " Throw yourself on the mercy of your closest living relative ? " He grinned . " Most certainly . " She flashed him a blinding smile . " You and dear Aunt Edwina would never abandon me and throw me into the streets . Still , I  --  or rather we  --  can not impose on your hospitality forever . " " You are certainly welcome to do so . I daresay my mother is beside herself at the idea of having four young women under her wing . She has long bemoaned the fact that she had no daughters and only one son who has not yet done his duty and provided her with a daughter-in-law . " Fiona laughed . " That does seem to be a constant theme in her letters . " She sobered and shook her head . " Regardless , we can not live here for the rest of our days as . . . as poor relations . " " You most definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
