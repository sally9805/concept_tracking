<p> WASHINGTON , Aug. 10  --  At a closed-door briefing in mid-July , senior intelligence officials startled lawmakers with some troubling news . American eavesdroppers were collecting just 25 percent of the foreign-based communications they had been receiving a few months earlier . <p> Congress needed to act quickly , intelligence officials said , to repair a dangerous situation . <p> Some lawmakers were alarmed . Others , jaded by past intelligence warnings , were skeptical . <p> The report helped set off a furious legislative rush last week that , improbably , broadened the administration 's authority to wiretap terrorism suspects without court oversight . <p> It was a surprising victory for the politically weakened White House on an issue that had plodded along in Congress for months without a clear sign of urgency or resolution . A flurry of talk in the last three weeks on intelligence gaps , heightened concern over terrorist attacks , burdensome court rulings and Congress 's recess helped turn the debate from a slow boil to a fever pitch . <p> For months , Democrats had refused to give the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over documents about the National Security Agency program to eavesdrop on some Americans ' international communications without warrants . <p> The White House refused to back down , even after Congressional subpoenas were issued . The administration ultimately attracted the support it needed to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act from moderate Democrats who felt pressed to act before the recess . <p> For the White House and its Republican allies , the decision by the Democratic-controlled Congress to act quickly was critical to safeguarding the country this summer as intelligence officials spoke of increasing " chatter " among Qaeda suspects . <p> To many Democrats who opposed the action , it was a reflection of fear mongering by the White House , and political capitulation by some fellow Democrats . <p> " There was an intentional manipulation of the facts to get this legislation through , " said Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee who voted against the plan . <p> The White House , Mr. Feingold said Friday in an interview , " has identified the one major remaining weakness in the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the administration when it 's making a power grab regarding terrorism and national security . " <p> " They have figured out that all they have to do is start talking about an imminent terrorist threat , back it up against a Congressional recess , and they know the Democrats will cave , " he added . <p> Representative Jane Harman , Democrat of California , said the White House " very skillfully played the fear card . " <p> " With the chatter up in August , " Ms. Harman said , " the issue of FISA reform got traction . Then they ran out the clock . " <p> A White House official said the push was driven by genuine concerns by Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence , for the government 's ability to conduct terrorist surveillance . <p> " There was no real argument on the need for a fix " between Democrats and Republicans , the White House official said . " He 's a straight shooter . " <p> The prelude to approval of the plan occurred in January , when the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . The court is charged with guarding against governmental spying abuses . Officials say one judge issued a ruling in January that allowed the administration to continue the program under the court 's supervision . <p> A ruling a month or two later  --  the judge who made it and its exact timing are not clear  --  restricted the government 's ability to intercept foreign-to-foreign communications passing through telecommunication " switches " on American soil . <p> The security agency was newly required to seek warrants to monitor at least some of those phone calls and e-mail messages . As a result , the ability to intercept foreign-based communications " kept getting ratcheted down , " said a senior intelligence official who insisted on anonymity because the account involved classified material . " We were to a point where we were not effectively operating . " <p> Mr. McConnell , lead negotiator for the administration in lobbying for the bill , said in an interview that the court 's restrictions had made his job much more difficult . <p> " It was crazy , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operatives that are killing Americans , doing foreign communications , " he said . " And the only reason I 'm signing that warrant is because it touches the U.S. communications infrastructure . That 's what we fixed . " <p> In April , Mr. McConnell began talking with lawmakers in classified meetings about that " intelligence gap " and alluded to it publicly , too . At the time , the administration proposed sweeping measures to " modernize " the foreign surveillance law , a much broader proposal in some respects than what Congress approved . <p> The proposal was considered dead on arrival by some Democrats , who argued that the administration was overreaching and asking Congress to legislate blindly without access to documents on the legal history and operations of the program . <p> Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales ' s political problems , including questions about truthfulness in testimony on the eavesdropping , helped stall any action , in part because the administration wanted him to have oversight of the broadened wiretapping authorities . <p> When the administration proposed its revisions in April , " everyone kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official who insisted on anonymity . " We got bludgeoned . People just said : ' Are you kidding ? We 're not even going to consider it . ' " <p> The administration 's classified briefings on the " intelligence gap " grew more urgent . In May , members of the Intelligence Committees began hearing about specific cases in which eavesdroppers could not intercept certain communications , said Representative Heather A. Wilson , Republican of New Mexico . <p> By June and early July , Ms. Wilson said Friday in an interview , the scope of what intelligence officials were missing had grown " frighteningly large . " <p> " I begged my colleagues to act , " she said . " They did nothing for six weeks . They were n't going to act unless they were forced to . So we started raising the pressure . " <p> Some Democrats reacted skeptically to the closed-door briefings by Mr. McConnell and other intelligence officials . Intelligence Committee members acknowledged that they learned in May that the secret court ruling had caused some problems , but it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They changed that story , " a Democratic Congressional aide said , amid talk about a backlog in warrant applications . <p> By mid-July , Mr. McConnell 's briefings , coupled with the release of a new National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism , set the tone for a series of talks between the White House and Mr. McConnell 's office and Democratic Congressional leaders . <p> After learning of the intelligence problems , Senator John D. Rockefeller IV , Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , contacted the White House to discuss repairing them . On July 12 , the White House chief of staff , Joshua B. Bolten , discussed the problem with the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , a senior White House official said . <p> At first , some Democratic leaders favored amending the surveillance law in September . Mr. McConnell pressed for an immediate repair . <p> Two weeks later , the administration lowered its sights , slimming its original 66-page proposal to 11 pages and eliminating some of the controversial plans like broad immunity from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats effectively agreed to try to forge a narrow bill to address the foreign problem that Mr. McConnell identified . But they were at odds over a critical detail , the court oversight . <p> Democratic leaders did not demand that the security agency seek individual court warrants for eavesdropping . But they did want the court to review and approve the agency procedures soon after surveillance began . <p> The administration , however , wanted the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to approve the surveillance , with the court weighing in just to certify that no abuses occurred , and only long after the surveillance had been conducted . <p> The talks intensified in the days before the recess last weekend , highlighted by proposals and counterproposals in calls between Mr. McConnell and the Democratic leadership . <p> By Aug. 2 , the two sides seemed relatively close to a deal . Mr. McConnell had agreed to some increased role for the secret court , a step that the administration considered a major concession , the White House and Congressional leaders said . <p> But that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Senate approved a Republican bill that omitted the stronger court oversight . The next day , the House passed the bill . <p> #
