He woke from a feverish sleep to see something bending over him . It was a shape of black ice , a tall featureless outline that exuded freezing cold . He tried to move , to cry out . Every muscle was frozen . Cold air touched his face , sucking out breath , warmth , life . We had gathered for tea on the veranda . It is a commodious apartment , stretching clear across the front of the house , and the screens covering the wide window apertures and outer door do not interfere with the splendid view . Looking out at the brilliant sunlight and golden sand , with the water of the Nile tinted by the sunset , it was hard to believe that elsewhere in the world snow covered the ground and icy winds blew . My state of mind was as benevolent as the gentle breeze . The delightful but exhausting Christmas festivities were over and a new year had begun  --  1922 , which , I did not doubt , would bring additional success to our excavations and additional laurels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this or any age . Affectionately I contemplated his impressive form  --  the sapphire-blue eyes and ebon hair , the admirable musculature of chest and arms , half bared by his casual costume . Our son , Ramses , who had acquired that nickname because he had the coloring of an Egyptian and , in his youth , the dogmatism of a pharaoh , sat comfortably sprawled on the settee , next to his beautiful wife , our adopted daughter , Nefret . Faint cries of protest and distress drifted to our ears from the house the dear little children and their parents occupied ; but even Nefret , the most devoted of mothers , paid them no heed . We were well accustomed to the complaints ; such sounds always accompanied the efforts of Fatima and her assistants ( it took several of them ) to wash and change the children . It would be some time before the little dears joined us , and when a carriage drew up in front of the house I could not repress a mild murmur of protest at the disturbance of our peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil is that ? " " Now , Emerson , do n't swear , " I said , watching a woman descend from the carriage . Asking Emerson not to use bad language is tantamount to King Canute 's ordering the tide not to surge in . His Egyptian sobriquet of " Father of Curses " is well deserved . " Do you know her ? " Emerson demanded . " No . " " Then tell her to go away . " " She appears to be in some distress , " Nefret said . Her physician 's gaze had noted the uncertain movements and hesitant steps . " Ramses , perhaps you had better see if she requires assistance . " " Assist her back into her carriage , " Emerson said loudly . Ramses looked from his wife to his father to me , his heavy black eyebrows tilting in inquiry . " Use your own judgment , " I said , knowing what the result would be . Ramses was too well brought up ( by me ) to be rude to a woman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached her she caught hold of his arm with both hands , swayed , and leaned against him . In a breathy , accented voice she said , " You are Dr. Emerson , I believe ? I must see you and your parents at once . " Somewhat taken aback by the title , which he had earned but never used , Ramses looked down at the face she had raised in entreaty . I could not make out her features , since she was heavily veiled . The veils were unrelieved black , as was her frock . It fit ( in my opinion ) rather too tightly to a voluptuously rounded figure . Short of prying her hands off his arm , Ramses had no choice but to lead her to the veranda . As soon as she was inside she adjusted the black chiffon veils , exposing a countenance whose semblance of youth owed more to art than to nature . Her eyes were framed with kohl and her full lips were skillfully tinted . Catching my eye , she lifted her chin in a practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I apologize for the intrusion . The matter is of some urgency . My name is Magda Petherick . I am the widow of Pringle Petherick . My life is threatened and only you can save me . " It was certainly the sort of introduction that captured one 's attention . I invited Mrs. Petherick to take a chair and offered her a cup of tea . " Take your time , " I said , for she was breathing quickly and her face was flushed . She carried a heavy reticule , which she placed at her feet before she accepted the cup from Ramses . Leaning against the wall , his arms folded , Emerson studied her interestedly . Like myself , he had recognized the name . " Your husband was Pringle Petherick , the well-known collector ? " he inquired . " I believe he passed away recently . " " November of last year , " she said . " A date that is engraved on my heart . " She pressed her hand over that region of her person and launched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded . " He woke that morning from a feverish sleep ... " This is what killed him , " she finished . Reaching into the bag , she withdrew a rectangular box painted with crude Egyptian sym-bols . " He had purchased it only a few weeks earlier , unaware that the curse of the long-dead owner yet clung to it . " A long pause ensued , while we all tried to think of an appropriate response . It had occurred to me , as I feel sure it has occurred to the Reader , that there was a certain literary air about her narrative , but even Emerson was not rude enough to inform a recently bereaved widow that she was either lying or demented ...
