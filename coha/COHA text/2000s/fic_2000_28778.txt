Shao Bin felt sick of Dismount Fort , a commune town where he had lived for over six years . His wife , Meilan , complained that she had to walk two miles to wash clothes on weekends . She could n't pedal , so Bin was supposed to take her on the carrier of his bicycle to the Blue Brook . But this month he worked weekends in the Harvest Fertilizer Plant and could n't help her . If only they had lived in Workers ' Park , the plant 's apartment compound , which was just hundreds of paces away from the waterside . These days Meilan prayed to Buddha at night , begging him to help her family get an apartment in the park soon . " Do n't worry . We 'll have one this time , " Bin told her Wednesday afternoon . " How can you be so sure ? " " They should give us one . I have more seniority than others . " " That ca n't be a guarantee . " Indeed he had worked in the plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seniority , this time it seemed the Shaos should have a new apartment , but Meilan was not optimistic . " You know , " she said , " if I were you I 'd give Secretary Liu and Director Ma two bottles of Grain Sap each . I heard that lots of people have visited them in the evenings . You should n't just sit and wait . " " Forget it . I wo n't spend any money on them . " " Stubborn ass , " she said under her breath . Bin was a small man . He used to be healthy and stout , but in recent years he had lost so much weight that people called him Skeleton behind his back . Despite his physique , he was both talented and arrogant . He was better read than others in the plant , and he knew a lot of ancient stories , even the adventures of Sherlock Holmes . What is more , his handwriting was handsome . That was why some women workers used to say to one another , " If only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When he was engaged to Meilan five years before , people had been amazed and remarked , " A beauty loves a scholar indeed . " Although Meilan was not beautiful and Bin was not a true scholar , compared with him she was a better match , having several suitors . Since they were married , they had lived in one room in a dormitory house on Old Folk Road , owned by Meilan 's work unit , the People 's Department Store . They now had a lively two-year-old , for whom alone the room , twelve feet by twenty , was hardly enough . Besides , Bin was an amateur painter and calligrapher , though officially he was a fitter . As an artist , he needed space , ideally a room for himself , where he could cultivate and practice his art , but that had been impossible . Every night he stayed up late , wielding a writing brush with the table lamp on , which disturbed his wife 's and baby 's sleep . And the room was always saturated with an inky smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold winter , yet Bin had no other way to do brushwork . How the Shaos were longing for decent housing . These days Bin had been trying in vain to find out whether or not his name was on the list being considered by the Housing Committee . Most of his fellow workers grew reticent and mysterious , as though all of a sudden everybody had struck gold ; they became mean to others . Now it 's my turn to have an apartment , Bin repeated to himself on Thursday morning , when he was repairing a hydraulic jack for the Transport Team . The night before , Meilan 's words about the workers ' bribing the leaders had sown some fear in him ; yet he kept reminding himself not to lose heart . Sooner than he expected , in the afternoon the final list was posted on the notice board at the plant 's front entrance . Bin went there but did n't find his name among the lucky ones . He was outraged ; so were many others . In all the workshops angry voices were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Some workers said they would put out big-character posters without delay , to expose the leaders ' corruption . A few declared they were going to demolish the four larger apartments built for the leaders , blowing them up with packages of TNT at night . But this was merely bluff ; the same thing had been said many times before , and nothing of the sort had ever taken place here . As soon as the electric bell announced the end of the shift , Bin left the plant . He was cycling home absently , an army cap askew on his head and his white shirt unbuttoned , its tail flapping gently behind him . His mind was full . How should he break the bad news to Meilan ? She would be so disappointed . How could he console her ? The moment he passed the railroad crossing near the northern end of the plant , he saw the Party secretary , Liu Shu , walking ahead with his hands clasped behind . Bin caught up with him and got off his bicycle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said . " All right . " Liu stopped and straightened up a little , his hooded eyes half closed . " Why did n't I get housing this time ? " Bin asked . " You 're not alone . Over a hundred comrades are still in line . Do n't you know that ? " " I 've worked in our plant for six years . Hou Nina has been here for only three years , but she got an apartment this time . Why ? I can not understand this . " Liu told him bluntly , " That 's a decision made by the Housing Committee . They believe she needs it more than you . Women and men are equal in our new society . You have a place to live now , but she has stayed with her folks in the village all these years . She needs her own place to get married . Her wedding has been put off twice ; she ca n't remain single forever . " Bin wanted to yell : She can live with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ; instead , he turned and hopped on his National Defense bicycle , riding away without saying good-bye to the secretary . He could n't help cursing Liu to himself , " Son of a tortoise , you 've had a good apartment already , but you took a larger one this time . You 've abused your power . This is unfair , unfair ! " The stocky secretary shook his head and said to Bin 's back , " Idiot ! " Bin planned to break the bad news to his wife after dinner , but seeing his dark face , Meilan sensed that something was wrong and asked him several times what it was . He went ahead and told her ; he even mentioned that Hou Nina , the junior accountant , had received a new apartment . At this , tears came to Meilan 's eyes , and she cursed the leaders loudly . She also blamed Bin for his stubbornness , saying , " A few bottles of liquor are a small cost . How many times did I tell you ? But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , picked up a pair of chopsticks , and lifted a bowl of noodles to his mouth , slurping the soup . Then with a spoon he put some minced toon leaves into his bowl . " I do n't want to eat , I 'm full of gas . " She turned and pushed the window open . Outside , a breeze passed by and shook a few raindrops off the aspen leaves , pattering through the trees . A frog was croaking hesitantly . " What are you going to do ? " she asked . " I do n't know . What do you think ? " " They 've maltreated us . You should report those corrupt men . " Bin did n't answer and went on eating . Shanshan , their baby daughter , was stirring her bowl of custard with a green plastic spoon , waiting for her mother to feed her . A short noodle was lying on her white bib , near the red bill of an embroidered dove . Meilan , in a sky blue dress , remained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was still fuming . She raised her hand and put a strand of hair back behind her small ear ; she leaned over the sill and spat out the window . Once in a while she wiped the tears off her cheeks with her thumb and forefinger . After dinner Bin was sitting outside the dormitory house , smoking and waving a fan on which spread a misty landscape  --  a temple , a river , and two slender boats , each punted by a tiny fisherman in a straw hat . His Adam 's apple moved up and down while his lean face looked tense . He was deep in thought ; his small eyes narrowed as the bushy brows joined . Above his head flared a 25-watt lightbulb , around which a puff of gnats were flitting , a few mosquitoes buzzing among them . The air smelled of rotten fish and fresh corn . Beyond the high wall two trucks were tooting their horns on the street , as if quarreling . In the middle of the courtyard , Meilan was washing bowls and dishes with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he had been in the wrong . A wise man should do everything to preempt bad odds , as Meilan had told him , but he had been impervious to reason and let the bad odds multiply . Unlike his plant , the department store had only sixteen employees ; it was unable to build an apartment house on its own . So his family depended on him to get decent housing , but he had blown the opportunity . Who could tell in what year a new apartment would be available again ? Heaven knew how long his family would have to live in this single room . Choking with anger , he was determined to do something about the injustice . Even though he could n't correct the leaders ' wrongdoing , he wanted to teach them an unforgettable lesson and show them that he would n't swallow an offense . But what should he do ? He remembered that the materialist thinker Wang Chong of the Han Dynasty had said something about punishing the evil with the writing brush . He could n't recall the exact words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essence of Ancient Chinese Thought , which he had read a few weeks before . He stood up and went back into the room . On the top of a wicker bookshelf , the book was sandwiched between an epigraphic dictionary and an album of flower paintings . He pulled it out and without difficulty found the passage , since he had folded the bottom corner of the page as a bookmark . He perused Wang Chong 's words : How can writing be merely playing with ink and toying with brush ? It must record people 's deeds and bequeath their names to posterity . The virtuous hope to have their deeds remembered and therefore exert themselves to do more good ; the wicked fear having their doings recorded and therefore make efforts to restrain themselves . In brief , the true scholar 's brush must encourage good and warn against evil . Bin closed the book , profoundly moved . Writing and painting belong to the same family of arts , he reasoned ; they are both the work of the brush . Yes , to fight the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist and scholar I ought to expose those corrupt leaders . Whatever they are , painting and writing must not be embroidery and decoration ; they must have strength and a soul  --  a healthy , upright spirit . A good piece of work should be as lethal as a dagger to evildoers . After Meilan and Shanshan went to bed , Bin began grinding an ink stick in his antique ink slab , which was in the shape of a crab , carved out of a Gold Star stone . His hand kept moving clockwise in tiny circles . The ink was ready in a few minutes ; he picked up a brush made of weasel 's hair and began to draw a cartoon . On a large sheet of paper he drew a huge official seal , standing upside down . Then on the seal 's bulky handle he sketched an ecstatic face with a few hairs on the crown . Up on the seal 's flat top , which was in the form of an oval stage , he put a dozen midget men and women sitting together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the center resembled Secretary Liu and Director Ma . Liu , wearing a handlebar mustache , sat with his short arms crossed before his chest , while Ma 's long face was pulled downward as though his mouth was filled with food . Behind the human figures Bin set up a six-story building with broad balconies and tall windows , from which fluorescent rays were darting out . The drawing finished , Bin dipped a smaller brush in the ink , then wrote a line of bold characters at the top of the paper as the title : " Happy Is the Family with Power . " The excitement of creating a meaningful piece of work kept him awake after he went to bed . He forced himself to count his heartbeats , which were faster than the second hand of the clock on the wall . His temples were tight , and his head would n't cool down ; within two hours he got up three times to urinate in the outhouse in the west corner of the courtyard . Not until two o'clock did he go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . " Good , good , " she said . " I hope this will be a land mine and blast them . " Carefully he stuffed it into a manila envelope addressed to the Luda Daily , a regional newspaper in which he had published three words of calligraphy . On his way to work , he went up Bank Street and dropped the envelope into the mailbox in front of the post office .
