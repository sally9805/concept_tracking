From basking in the glitz of " Ocean 's Thirteen " to navigating the subtle drama of " Michael Clayton "  --  and pressing for a bit of social change in between  --  the Hollywood multitasker reflects on a fulfilling year . If not for one unlucky September afternoon on the streets of New Jersey , 2007 would have been just perfect for George Clooney . In the first calendar year after his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor in Syriana , he headlined the well-received blockbuster Ocean 's Thirteen , turned in one of the most forceful performances of his career in the legal drama Michael Clayton ( which he also exec-produced ) , and even popped up doing humanitarian work in the documentary Darfur Now . And the guy still had time to direct the football romance Leatherheads ( due in April ) , take a role as an assassin in the Coen brothers ' upcoming comedy Burn After Reading , and , of course , crash his motorcycle . With or without a fractured rib , Clooney has forever been the definition of class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own and assuming it very graciously , " says Tilda Swinton , Clooney 's costar in both Clayton and Burn After Reading . " He has a very developed sense of service . And who knows what he 's going to do with it . " Indeed , no other Hollywood star more deftly balanced box office viability with personal responsibility this year . Calling from Washington , D.C. , the evening before wrapping Burn , the 46-year-old discussed the highs ( and low ) of the past 12 months . EW Did you expect Michael Clayton to earn such strong reviews ? GC It 's a funny thing , because you have a movie that you 've sat on for a year because you 're trying to find a release date . And a lot of times , things start to get that smell of that " There 's something wrong with it and that 's why it has n't come out " kind of thing . So I was concerned with that . But the films that were supposed to be the critical darlings were falling by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . EW You deferred your salary in favor of profit participation . Now that Michael Clayton has grossed over $37 million , when will you start getting paid ? GC Probably right about now , I guess . We 're already way out of the hole in terms of cost of the film . It cost 20 million to do , which is dirt cheap for a movie of that caliber . So we 're all in good shape . If you make a film like The Good German and it 's critically thumped , the box office is destroyed . That makes it very hard to make another challenging film . So this one now being successful both critically and financially means we get to make another one of these . EW You 're a decent bet for a Best Actor nomination for Clayton . Do you think it 's one of your best performances ? GC My job was to serve the material , and I think I did that as best I can do . I do n't really know how to do it any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at my best in  --  Out of Sight or Three Kings or O Brother , those are good films . So I survive best around good material . EW After all the negative response to Ocean 's Twelve , do you feel like you evened the score with Thirteen ? GC I feel like we got the movie back . I thought Twelve missed in some ways . You get to a point where you go , " Well , now , do we really want all these guys to just get richer ? " It started to feel like wealthy guys looking to get wealthier , which correlated into people 's opinions of the actors as well . And I think people did n't dig it as much . Thirteen made sense because it was a revenge picture . EW So is the door open or closed on doing an Ocean 's Fourteen ? GC Absolutely , without question , closed . The only person who tries to keep it open is Jerry Weintraub , because he 's the consummate producer . EW You and your Ocean 's cohorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Weintraub  --  also started a nonprofit , Not on Our Watch , this year . GC What happened was , Jerry said , " We 're going to the Cannes Film Festival . " And I said , " Well , that 's a dumb thing , to take a second sequel to the Cannes Film Festival . That just screams " Get your ass kicked by a lot of people . ' ' " Then I was like , You know what ? If we 're going to go and get our ass kicked , then at least there 's going to be a million cameras around and a million people around , and Europe is n't talking about Darfur nearly as much as the United States is . So let 's make it worth our while . Let 's make all those cameras do something . Now we 're actually becoming a legitimate , real , ongoing charity as opposed to this one-time big hit . Like , we have the worst Internet page you 've ever seen in your life . But Brad , Matt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charities . These guys really put their money where their mouth is and go to work . Brad goes down to New Orleans and designs houses , and Matt and Don go into Africa . I 'm very proud to be amongst that group . EW So was your motorcycle accident the one big bummer for you this year ? GC That was a drag . This is hysterical : In one of the scenes of Burn After Reading I 've got this triangular-shaped pillow that 's supposedly a " marital aid " of some sort , and my character leaves home with it . And the paparazzi got a picture of me with it . And then the papers said ever since my motorcycle accident I 've had to use this marital aid ! Tomorrow I have to do a scene out on the Mall in Washington where I have to stand up on a chair and cry really loudly like a 6-year-old . I 'm sure that 'll be all over the papers too .
