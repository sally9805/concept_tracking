<p> Are the planters and curvier roads being constructed in Atlanta neighborhoods a way to calm traffic or a new traffic hazard ? <p> Several neighborhood thoroughfares in Atlanta have been redesigned to " calm traffic . " <p> The new , curvier road lanes , planters and bike lanes are drawing both praise and complaints . <p> Some roads in Buckhead , including East Wesley Road , are being redesigned by the city of Atlanta to " calm traffic . " <p> Numerous yards along East Wesley , which links the Garden Hills neighborhood with both Peachtree and Piedmont roads , have sprouted yard signs protesting the ongoing work . <p> A similar project in the Peachtree Hills neighborhood in Buckhead , which also links Peachtree and Piedmont roads , recently was completed . <p> What do you think about such " traffic calming " projects ? Good idea ? Bad idea ? Please explain . <p> GOOD IDEA : Police presence the best solution <p> Traffic-calming projects are a good idea . Traffic is much better on Lindbergh Drive from the MARTA station to Peachtree Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police presence . Note , I did n't say " increased " police presence . I never see cops patrolling the streets , period . <p> MERCY WRIGHT , Buckhead <p> Speed humps not the best remedy <p> They are a good idea . While there are no traffic-calming measures that I oppose , I have a preference for those other than speed humps . <p> The speed humps are a bit aggravating in that they can not always be traversed at the speed limit . <p> JOE DeROSE , Old Fourth Ward <p> Change effective in Little Five Points <p> I 've seen this type of change on side streets in the Little Five Points area and they are an improvement . The islands provide a great opportunity for the neighborhood to express themselves with attractive plantings . <p> Also , they make the parking situation much more intuitive . There is no question about whether you are parking too close to the corner if you have to bump up over a curb and park on top of an island to do it . <p> I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our street do not appear to be effective . People who are inclined to speed accelerate like mad between humps and then slam on the brakes . The people who are not speeders in the first place go over them at about two miles an hour . <p> KAY STEPHENSON , Virginia-Highland <p> Neighborhoods not for transportation <p> These measures are outstanding and help tremendously . Neighborhoods were not meant to be conduits for transportation . These measures are appropriate and overdue . <p> PATRICK EARLEY , Works in Midtown , lives in Lilburn <p> Traffic calmers should be ' multiuse ' <p> Traffic calmers that are " multiuse " are a good idea . It is good to encourage foot and bike traffic with winding streets , plants on the median and bike lanes . Merely putting huge humps in the street that sneak up on you if you do not know the neighborhood and jar your teeth serve little purpose . <p> JOE GUASTAFERRO , Midtown <p> Protesters too late to sound off <p> For the most part  --  a good idea . The folks who are protesting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in expressing their opinions . I do n't live in that neighborhood , but I am sure the plan was presented by the city in civic association and NPU meetings . I would assume most of the current protesters are folks who do n't participate in their local organizations and , consequently , did n't know about it until work crews arrived . <p> These traffic-calming projects would not be needed if folks would drive sensibly through residential areas . Same story for the controversial red light cameras . The cameras would n't be needed if folks did not run red lights . <p> JOHN WOLFINGER , Virginia-Highland <p> UNDECIDED : No matter what , drawbacks exist <p> This is one of those cases when it seems you 're damned if you do and you 're damned if you do n't ! I would think residents would want traffic slowed in their neighborhoods , and I ca n't imagine what the objection is about , but I guess I 'd have to be there to see what they 're experiencing to be fair . <p> Now , if millions are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand taxpayers ' objections . <p> I would think speed bumps could do the trick rather than curvier lanes . Curvier lanes sound like more of a hazard , especially for speeders who do n't slow down just because the road curves . <p> SHARON MARKS , Decatur <p> BAD IDEA : Peachtree Hills Avenue a disaster <p> If Peachtree Hills Avenue is an example , it is a bad idea . All this has done is create parking difficulties for the residents , and the construction has created road hazards . Most of the markings on the speed bumps have already been worn off and you can see where many cars have hit the bumped-out curbs . <p> Delivery and garbage trucks block the road by parking at the bump-outs instead of pulling into the cutouts , and frequently drivers swerve across the middle line on the curves . <p> JOE BALABAN , Peachtree Road , near Peachtree Hills <p> Street calmers might damage your car <p> Street calmers are dangerous . I have already run into them and ruined a tire and rim . They are very confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookhaven/Lenox area <p> Bumps , curves , etc. , create hazards <p> Speed bumps , curved road lanes , planters and bike lanes may calm traffic for some , but I find them hazardous . If we have neighborhoods already trying them , why not compare them with other neighborhoods that have not ? <p> A study of this kind makes better sense than going all out to change our neighborhood streets . I 'm familiar with the Peachtree Hills change . My preference is to find a different route . Is this calming or avoiding ? <p> CARL TYLER , Atlanta <p> Result the opposite of intended effect <p> Bad idea . It does the complete opposite of calming , because when you 're driving you have the sense that you ca n't turn corners if another car is there waiting to pull out . I live on Peachtree and frequently use Lindbergh Drive where some calming measures have been constructed and hate that the same thing appears to be happening on East Wesley . <p> KATHY LOISELLE , Peachtree Road , just north of Lindbergh <p> Proposal unneeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary and just gets in the way . It can just make things more confusing and cause disruption . People will drive how they drive anyway . <p> CHRISTI SIZEMORE BEHREND , Underwood Hills <p> The Voice of CityLife is a panel of residents who answer online questionnaires on various topics .
