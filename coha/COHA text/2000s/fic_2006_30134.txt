Over a long , successful career of killing people for money , Walter Henderson had never before snuffed out a personal enemy . He 'd made a habit of keeping his private life and his business affairs separate , and planning to break that habit now aroused a variety of new emotions in him , none of them pleasant . Anxiety , resentment , and the kind of bone-deep reluctance a lazy schoolboy might feel , facing a pile of homework . . . these were not sentiments with which Walter Henderson , a paid assassin , had any significant experience . Thus as he sat waiting in his comfortable leather armchair for the inevitable to occur , he tried yet again to come up with some other way out of the situation in which he found himself . But he 'd been over it all a hundred times in his head already and he 'd found none . Because there were n't any . So now here he was . I 'm not even supposed to be doing this anymore , he thought irritably . With one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd decided that his death-dealing days were history . But apparently resolutions really were made to be broken , he thought . Then came the sound he 'd been waiting to hear : stealthy footsteps on the gravel driveway outside , not far from his open window . Walter looked up from the book he 'd been pretending to read , in the warm pool of light in the den of his large , luxuriously appointed housein Eastport , Maine . It was late . The housekeeper had gone home to her own house , and his teenaged daughter Jen was already in bed . Or so she 'd tried hard to convince him as she 'd headed upstairs an hour earlier : clad in pajamas , carrying a glass of milk and a handful of cookies , and yawning elaborately . Smiling with affection , thinking how pretty she was with her golden tan , strong athlete 's body , and sun-bleached blonde hair , Walter had bid his daughter a fond good night . Then he 'd built a fire in the enormous granite fireplace that formed one whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged driftwood so it flamed extravagantly before settling to a fierce red glow . After that , with a scant two fingers of Laphroaig in a chunky cut-crystal lowball glass to keep him company , he 'd sat down with his book to wait . Despite the chilly spring evening the fire let him keep the window open , admitting salt air and whiffs of wood smoke along with the distant , varied hoots and moans of the foghorns on the dark water a few hundred yards distant . Now Walter sat very still , listening to the sound of cautious movement outside , a whispery crunching on stones that someone was trying to minimize . To no avail . That you could n't approach the house without traversing an expanse of pea gravel was not an accident , any more than the elaborate alarm system , heat-and-motion detectors , or closed-circuit TV cameras that Walter had installed when he 'd had the house built . All turned off now , of course . Walter did n't want any record , electronic or otherwise , of what transpired here tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy of his run up from the city a week earlier to disarm the devices , taking care to make it appear that the central controller circuits had silently malfunctioned . In the unlikely event that anyone checked . Walter listened a while longer to be certain it was n't only a wild animal out there , a deer or raccoon or maybe even a moose . There were plenty of them on the island where Eastport was located , seven miles off the coast of downeast Maine and another thousand or so from the neon-lit nightlife Walter Henderson was used to : pimps and hookers , loan sharks and dope addicts , pushers and grifters . . . All in the past now , he reminded himself without regret . And from the sound of it , tonight 's visitor was indeed human . A glance outside confirmed this ; there was a light on in the barn , faintly illuminating a high square of window . Which there had n't been the last time Walter looked . He waited ten deliberate minutes , then laid his book aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual place in the upper right-hand drawer of his desk . Placing the gun in his sweater pocket , he padded from the room , pausing in the dark hall but not bothering to go upstairs to see whether or not Jen was really asleep . He knew she was n't , that the yawning and milk getting and elaborate expressions of tiredness had all been an act . For the past few weeks , ever since she 'd graduated and come home from the exclusive New York boarding school where she 'd spent her high school years , she 'd been sneaking out via those same back stairs nearly every night to meet a boy . And not just any boy . Walter knew it was that worthless little helper the carpenters had brought with them last summer when they arrived to rebuild the barn . Which by itself was okay , bringing along a useless helper . He understood that . People had expenses to cover and sometimes they resorted to methods . Charge high , pay low . . . it was how the world worked . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an arrangement with the supplier . All standard business practice and all right as rain as far as Walter was concerned , as long as nobody got too greedy . The kid , though . The kid was something else . Because when the barn job was done and the carpenters had all gone , the kid kept coming around . Doing another kind of job now , was n't he ? On Walter Henderson 's daughter . The thought stopped him in his tracks : Jennifer . His pearl , the only person he knew of in the world who had n't somehow been contaminated or befouled . The idea of some mangy little nobody with grimy fingernails even thinking about touching her . . Well , but it was n't thinkable , was it ? That was the whole point . Back in the city he 'd have snapped the kid 's neck with his two hands , and that would 've been that . Dumped him in a landfill or in the trunk of an abandoned car ; if push really came to shove there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no problem . But Walt could n't do any of those things here , not without screwing up his plans for finishing off that other loose end . And now it seemed no matter what else he tried , he could n't get rid of the kid . Padding quietly in the plush moosehide L.L. Bean moccasins Jennifer had given him for Christmas , he slipped down the hall to the silent kitchen , past dimly gleaming appliances and the wall-mounted panel for the alarm system . The panel 's bulbs glowed green , meaning the system had been armed . But according to Walt 's gadget-literate buddy , " on " commands were n't reaching the devices the system controlled . Walt had n't told Jen about that , though ; no need . For all she knew , the alarms worked as they always had . Thinking this , he continued along the dim passageway past the utility room where a pair of Irish wolfhounds stayed when he needed them to be out of the way . A low wuff came from inside the room as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor as they paced uneasily , alerted by the sound of his presence . Warning growls issued from their throats . Walter made a face . Ideally , the two expensively bred guard animals should have remained utterly silent . But he had n't been able to stomach the severity of the aversion training required to accomplish this . Or to make them bite , either . Yet another sign that he was getting soft , he decided . He 'd retired at the right time . But not too soft to do what needed to be done this evening ; dogs were one thing , snot-nosed little daughter-molesting punks quite another , he reminded himself without much effort . Quite another , and not much effort at all ; like riding a bike . " Easy , guys , " he murmured to the dogs as he let himself out the back door , easing it shut behind him . He paused on the flagstone terrace overlooking Passamaquoddy Bay . Across it the windows in the houses along the distant shoreline of Campobello Island glowed distinctly . Below them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while to the north the white beacon of the Cherry Island light swirled slowly , strobing the night . He stepped from the terrace to the lawn , wincing at the icy breeze . April may be the cruelest month , he thought as he made his way downhill toward the squarish dark shape of the barn outlined on an even darker moonless sky , but in Maine at night you could pretty much count on May being a mean bastard , too . The light in the barn had gone out . Pausing , he hefted the gun in his pocket as easily as other men might handle jackhammers or drive heavy equipment ; tool of the trade . When he slipped inside the barn the scent of the new wood mingled with the sweet , grassy smell of the straw bales piled in the loft . But then came a hint of Jen 's expensive perfume , faint but enough to send fresh fury coursing through him . For an instant he imagined the two of them up there , visualized them freezing together in fright at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe , or the grinding of his teeth . Or the hot slither of the muscles in his forearms as his fists clenched and released . Clenched and released . The boy shriveling , Jen scrambling to cover herself . . . Walter pushed the thoughts away , smelling now the sharp reek of gasoline from the big lawn tractor in the corner . Behind it on hooks , although he could not see them , were gardening tools , the curved scythes and heavy shears , cutting and chopping implements . All with their blades freshly sharpened . Walter moved soundlessly in the utter blackness , needing no light once his predatory instincts kicked in . He knew how to do this , and he knew his way in the dark . To his right were the loft steps and behind them an area under the loft , originally meant for open space . But Walter 's housekeeper , a habitually silent and thus thoroughly satisfactory employee he 'd brought with him when he moved here from the city , had surprised him by suggesting that the area be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired to oversee the grounds and the animals would n't end up tramping in and out of the main house . So a room had been built there , unused as yet and with the loft 's original trap-door opening still piercing its ceiling . Guy ever needs to escape out of his own office , he can go straight up , Walter had thought with grim humor . If he can jump that high . Unlikely , though , that the kid Walter was after tonight had gone down into the office space . Because the jumping part was no joke ; it was a good fifteen feet from the loft to the concrete floor below . And the office was locked ; if you got into it from above , there was no way out . Walter felt the tight smile vanish from his lips . No way out for me , either . Or only one way . And damn it , the whole thing was really all his own fault , was n't it ? He 'd been firm enough in forbidding Jen from seeing the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of disobedience . And he knew why . Raising the child by himself after her mother 's death , Walter had n't wanted Jennifer to be afraid of him . He could n't bear seeing the knowledge arise in her eyesas it had in the desperate , imploring eyes of so many othersthat he was dangerous . Thus he had failed to confide in his daughter certain important details about himself . Such as what he did for a living : that he solved problems for people . Serious problems , ones so difficult and unpleasant that they could be taken care of only by force . But that was n't the kind of thing you told a little girl who idolized and adored you : that her father was maybe the most respected and feared professional killer on the whole east coast . And later . . . Well , the time had just never been right . So at the outset of this whole business , Walter had merely asked Jen if she did n't think a town kid with no money and no prospects was maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd responded indulgently , looking up from the magazine she was reading . " What an old-fashioned way to look at things ! " Yeah , it was . He was an old-fashioned father . And his daughter 's answer had told him her reaction to his comments , too : she was n't taking the hint . That had been in the winter when she was home for holiday break . As soon as Jen returned to school , he 'd arranged to have the kid prosecuted for stalking ; an easy task , since maybe the local yokels did n't know who Walter Henderson was but the state yokels certainly did . Enough of them , anyway , to get accomplished what Walter required . The kid 's public defender , a jug-eared bumpkin with a boil on his neck and dandruff on his suit , had looked appalled at the sight of Walter 's expensive legal team , the courtroom equivalent of a tank full of piranhas . Jennifer had come home for only a single day to testify , and despite her furious resentment she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . He 'd been clear enough about that . And even if she did n't know the nature of his employment , she knew he controlled the purse strings : her tuition , pocket money , clothing allowance , car , all the rest . She was a smart girl , his Jennifer . Just not quite smart enough . The verdict , predictably , had been guilty . Disposition : the defendant was out on bail until the sentencing hearing . Which , Walter recalled as he stood very still on the barn 's main floor , was tomorrow . But his pending court date apparently had n't deterred the kid in the slightest . Walter turned slowly in a half circle , feeling the concrete beneath his moccasins , sensing the bulk of the timber-constructed loft in the shadows above . Silence . Except for . . . What the hell ? Suddenly he was all business , both hands on the pistol grip , feet planted like an athlete 's . Gun up in a practiced stance , his eyes scanning the darkness , he swung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still had the strong impression of someone very near . Silent , or almost silent . . . Calm down , Walter ordered himself . Cat-footed , he eased forward , feeling his pupils dial out to take advantage of any stray gleam . But . . . nothing . Puzzled , he moved stealthily back out to where the barn 's massive rafters rose high above his head unseen . The darkness up there was cavernous . The sound he 'd heard had likely been just a barn beam creaking . Or a mouse . Continues ...
