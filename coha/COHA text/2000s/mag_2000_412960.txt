BASEBALL 'S BEST PLAYERS AND BEST TEAMS ( USUALLY ) PLAY THEIR BEST WHEN THE WORLD SERIES ROLLS AROUND . // PLAYERS AND GREAT TEAMS shine in big games . In baseball , no games are bigger than the World Series . Anything can happen when the American League and National League champs meet each October in a best-of seven series . The first team to win four games takes the title . It does n't matter how they get there , as long as they get there . And many have gotten there in some memorable ways : The Hobbling Hero The Los Angeles Dodgers ' Kirk Gibson could barely walk thanks to a pulled hamstring . Surely he would have to sit out the 1988 Series against the Oakland A 's . But with the Dodgers down to their last out in Game One and trailing 4-3 , Gibson hobbled out of the dugout to pinch hit . With a runner on first , Gibson promptly launched Oakland relief ace Dennis Eckersley 's pitch into the right-field seats . As Gibson limped around the bases pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. 's improbable championship over the powerhouse A 's . Mr. October Gets the Call Former Yankees great Reggie Jackson earned the nickname " Mr. October " thanks to his heroics in 1977 . Hall of Famer Babe Ruth twice hit three homers in a Series game , but never on just three pitches . Jackson did just that - and added two other homers for a record five in the Series-to power New York over the Dodgers . Right Place , Right Time Two Pittsburgh Pirates have ended World Series with home runs . Bill Mazeroski 's blast in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game Seven gave the Pirates the 1960 championship over the New York Yankees . Current Pirates second baseman Warren Morris hit a twoout , two-run shot in 1996-to power Louisiana State University over Miami in the College World Series . High-Flying Blue Jay Hitless in his previous seven at-bats , Toronto 's Joe Carter quickly became the hero of the 1993 Series . With the Philadelphia Phillies leading , 6-5 , in the bottom of the ninth of Game Six , Carter swatted Mitch Williams 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the Blue Jays their second consecutive championship . Stay Fair , Stay Fair ! ' Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk can talk to baseballs . Or so it appeared in 1975 , when the former Boston Red Sox catcher seemed to urge his 12th-inning home run to land fair , forcing a deciding Game Seven between Boston and the Cincinnati Reds . But the Reds had // a few Hall of Famers of their own and used Joe Morgan 's ninthinning heroics to win Game Seven and the championship . Beat ' em Fair and Square-Almost The Cincinnati Reds won the 1919 World Series , but they might not have been the best team . Eight members of the Chicago White Sox-including would-be Hall of Famer " Shoeless " Joe Jackson-were later banned from baseball for allegedly taking money from gamblers to lose to the Reds an purpose . Reds outfielder Edd Roush would hear no excuses from the so-called " Black Sox . " " One thing that 's overlooked in the whole mess is that we could have beaten them no matter what the circumstances ! " Roush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have won 24 World Series titlesthat 's more than one-fourth of all the Series that have been played . The St. Louis Cardinals are a distant second place with nine titles . Pitcher Perfect No pitcher has ever matched the performance of the Yankees ' Don Lateen in Game Five of the 1956 Series . Not a single Brooklyn Dodger reached base that game , marking the first-and only-perfect game in World Series history . A Series Regular Some great players go their whole careers without playing in the World Series . Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter won three championships in just his first four full years in the majors . He 's not just along for the ride . Jeter had at least one hit in every playoff game last season . Home-Run King Yankees Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle leads the pack with 18 home runs in the World Series . Former Yankees great Babe Ruth ranks second with 15 . Three-in-One In 1920 , Cleveland second baseman Bill Wambsganss pulled off the only unassisted triple play in Series history . With Brooklyn Robins ( as the Dodgers were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robins batter Clarence Mitchell 's line drive for the first out , stepped on second to force one runner and tagged the runner coming from first for three outs on one play . // <p>
