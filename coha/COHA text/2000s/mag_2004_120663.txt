There is a fine line between euphoria and deep disappointment in the make-or-break lives of NFL coaches . We see it every week , and it was never more evident than on Sunday at the Georgia Dome as the Buccaneers and their coach , Jon Gruden , fought to remain within reach of the playoffs in a game against the Falcons . // During its 2002 championship season , Tampa Bay beat Atlanta twice by a total of 38 points . But the Bucs have struggled to regain their stride since routing the Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII , and these are n't the same Falcons either . Atlanta has better talent , more offensive weapons and a more effective pass rush than it had two years ago . Even when Gruden 's offense knew the pass rush was coming hard , the line was powerless to protect quarterback Brian Griese , who was sacked seven times . // Still , Tampa Bay battled back from a 17-0 first-half deficit on a pair of touchdown passes from Griese , one of which was set up by an interception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta 28 , the Bucs were in position to tie the game . But instead of a 45-yard Martin Gramatica field goal attempt , Gruden called a toss sweep to running back Michael Pittman , who was dropped for a two-yard loss . On the third play of the Falcons ' ensuing possession Michael Vick 's 49-yard touchdown pass to tight end Alge Crumpler capped the 24-14 Atlanta win . // Gruden 's shunning the field goal was illogical . The Tampa Bay defense was playing well at the time ; since taking its 17 -- 0 lead with 10:25 left in the second quarter , Atlanta had only 14 net yards and no first downs to show for its six possessions . Granted , Gramatica had missed on seven of his previous nine tries from beyond 40 yards , and he was still bothered by a hip flexor injury . But if you do n't have enough faith in your kicker to try a 45-yard field goal in the fourth quarter of a tight game , why is he even in uniform ? // " We 're not playing for a tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , outside the Bucs ' locker room . " Did you see our injury report ? Gramatica was questionable this week . " // " But , " a reporter pointed out , " he kicked off fine today -- 70 , 71 and 72 yards on his three kicks . " // " Congratulations , " Gruden said sarcastically . Then he added , " He 's been struggling beyond 40 yards . You second-guess it all you want . We were 3 -- 5 . We 're playing to win . We make that field goal -- rah , rah , rah -- then what ? " Well , if your defense can contain Vick again , you get the ball back and try to win the game with another field goal or a touchdown. // The loss dropped Tampa Bay ( 3 -- 6 ) four games behind the Falcons ( 7-2 ) in the NFC South . But in a broader sense , just where are the Bucs headed , and how is the workaholic Gruden coping with his team 's 10-15 performance over the last 25 games ? // In the past year Gruden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly roster by jettisoning veterans like Keyshawn Johnson , Warren Sapp , John Lynch and Keenan McCardell . In time , the younger Bucs will be better for having done so . Rookie wideout Michael Clayton ( 48 catches , 14.3-yard average ) is going to be a star ; the first-round draft pick out of LSU is fast , sure-handed and tough . Griese , who became the starter in Week 6 , has been a terrific find , completing 69.7% of his passes and getting the upper hand in the battle to come with Chris Simms , a third-round draft choice in 2003 , next summer . However , the line , pieced together largely through bargain free-agent shopping , remains a weakness , allowing 27 sacks and clearing the way for only 3.7 yards per running attempt . // Defensively , Tampa Bay appears to have the right mix of youth and experience , and the unit was ranked sixth in the league entering Sunday 's game . The Falcons broke through for 205 yards rushing , but that was partly because mainstay defensive tackle Booger McFarland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have faith that we 're going in the right direction , " Pro Bowl cornerback Ronde Barber , an eight-year veteran , said last week . " It 's easy for me to say because I was n't one of the guys they got rid of in the off-season . But what they 're trying to do , obviously , is get rid of a guy a year too soon rather than a year too late . " // Barber says Gruden is coaching just as he did in 2002 . " He expects the play to be executed the exact same way it appears in his head , every time , " he says . " He 's the best I 've ever seen at motivation . " // Nevertheless , in the wake of Sunday 's loss , Gruden was in a sour frame of mind . When asked if he believes the team is headed in the right direction , he replied in a voice dripping with sarcasm , " Sure , everything 's going great . All the recent draft picks are Pro Bowl guys . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and I 've taken this house and burned it down . " // Then he took a breath . " We 've got some good guys on this team , " he said . " We 'll be back . I 'm very confident we 'll be back . "
