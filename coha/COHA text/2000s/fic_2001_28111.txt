" Someone 's coming . " Terry McCaleb looked at his wife and then followed her eyes down to the winding road below . He could see the golf cart making its way up the steep and winding road to the house . The driver was obscured by the roof of the cart . They were sitting on the back deck of the house he and Graciela had rented up on La Mesa Avenue . The view ranged from the narrow winding road below the house to the whole of Avalon and its harbor , and then out across the Santa Monica Bay to the haze of smog that marked overland . The view had been the reason they had chosen this house to make their new home on the island . But at the moment his wife had spoken his gaze had been on the baby in his arms , not the view . He could look no farther than his daughter 's wide blue and trusting eyes . McCaleb saw the rental number on the side of the golf cart passing below . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from overland on the Catalina Express . Still , he wondered about how Graciela knew that the visitor was coming to their house and not any of the others on La Mesa . He did n't ask about this she 'd had premonitions before . He just waited and soon after the golf cart disappeared from sight , there was a knock at the front door . Graciela went to answer it and soon came back to the deck with a woman McCaleb had not seen in three years . Sheriff 's Detective Jaye Winston smiled when she saw the child in his arms . It was genuine , but at the same time it was the distracted smile of someone who was n't there to admire a new baby . McCaleb knew the thick green binder she carried in one hand and thevideo cassette in the other meant Winston was there on business . Death business . " Terry , howya been ? " she asked . " Could n't be better . You remember Graciela ? " " Of course . And who is this ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's formal name around others . He only liked to call her Cielo when he was alone with her . " CiCi , " Winston said , and hesitated as if waiting for an explanation of the name . When none came , she said , " How old ? " " Almost four months . She 's big . " " Wow , yeah , I can see ... And the boy ... where 's he ? " " Raymond , " Graciela said . " He 's with some friends today . Terry had a charter and so he went with friends to the park to play softball . " The conversation was halting and strange . Winston either was n't really interested or was unused to such banal talk . " Would you like something to drink ? " McCaleb offered as he passed the baby to Graciela . " No , I 'm fine . I had a Coke on the boat . " As if on cue , or perhaps indignant about being passed from one set of hands to another , the baby started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She left them then , standing on the porch . McCaleb pointed to the round table and chairs where they ate most nights while the baby slept . " Let 's sit down . " He pointed Winston to the chair that would give her the best view of the harbor . She put the green binder , which McCaleb recognized as a murder book , on the table and the video on top of it . " Beautiful , " she said . " Yeah , she 's amazing . I could watch her all " He stopped and smiled when he realized she was talking about the view , not his child . Winston smiled , too . " She 's beautiful , too , Terry . She really is . You look good , too , so tan and all . " " I 've been going out on the boat . " " And your health is good ? " " Ca n't complain about anything other than all the pills they make me take . But I 'm three years in now and no problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just have to keep taking the damn pills and it should stay that way . " He smiled and he did appear to be the picture of health . As the sun had turned his skin dark it had worked to the opposite effect on his hair . Close cropped and neat , it was almost blonde now . Working on the boat had also defined the muscles of his arms and shoulders . The only giveaway was hidden under his shirt , the ten-inch scar left by transplantation surgery . " That 's great , " Winston said . " It looks like you have a wonderful setup here . New family , new home ... away from everything . " She was silent a moment , turning her head as if to take in all of the view and the island and McCaleb 's life at once . McCaleb always thought Jaye Winston was attractive in a tomboyish way . She had loose sandy blonde hair that she kept at shoulder length . She had never worn makeup back when he worked with her . But she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , as if she saw the humor and tragedy in everything at once . She wore black jeans and a white t-shirt beneath a black blazer . She looked cool and tough and McCaleb knew from experience that she was . She had a habit of hooking her hair behind her ear frequently as she spoke . He found that endearing for some unknown reason . He had always thought that if he had not connected with Graciela he might have tried to know Jaye Winston better . He also sensed that Winston intuitively knew that . " Makes me feel guilty about why I came , " she said . " Sort of . " McCaleb nodded at the binder and the tape . " You came on business . You could have just called , Jaye . Saved some time probably . " " No , you did n't send out any change of address or phone cards . Like maybe you did n't want people to know where you ended up . " She hooked her hair behind her left ear and smiled again . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think people would want to know where I was . So how did you find me ? " " Asked around over at the marina on the mainland . " " Overland . They call it overland here . " " Overland then . They told me in the harbor master 's office that you still kept a slip there but you moved the boat over here . I came over and took a water taxi around the harbor until I found it . Your friend was there . He told me how to get up here . " " Buddy . " McCaleb looked down into the harbor and picked out The Following Sea . It was about a half-mile or so away . He could see Buddy Lockridge bent over in the stern . After a few moments he could tell that Buddy was washing off the reels with the hose from the freshwater tank . " So what 's this about , Jaye ? " McCaleb said without looking at Winston . " Must be important for you to go through all of that on your day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Most of them . " She pushed the tape aside and opened the binder . Now McCaleb looked over . Although it was upside down to him , he could tell the top page was a standard homicide occurrence report , usually the first page in every murder book he had ever read . It was the starting point . His eyes went to the address box . Even upside down he could make out that it was a West Hollywood case . " I 've got a case here I was hoping you 'd take a look at . In your spare time , I mean . I think it might be your sort of thing . I was hoping you 'd give me a read , maybe point me someplace I have n't been yet . " He had known as soon as he had seen the binder in her hands that this was what she was going to ask him . But now that it had been asked he felt a confusing rush of sensations . He felt a thrill at the possibility of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt over the idea of bringing death into a home so full of new life and happiness . He glanced toward the open slider to see if Graciela was looking out at them . She was n't . " My sort of thing ? " he said . " If it 's a serial you should n't waste time . Go to the bureau , call Maggie Griffin . She 'll " " I did all of that , Terry . I still need you . " " How old is this thing ? " " Two weeks . " Her eyes looked up from the binder to his . " New Year 's Day ? " She nodded . " First murder of the year , " she said . " For L.A. County , at least . Some people think the true millennium did n't start until this year . " " You think this is a millennium nut ? " " Whoever did this was a nut of some order . I think . That 's why I 'm here . " " What did the bureau say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't kept up , Terry . Maggie was sent back to Quantico . Things slowed down in the last few years out here and Behavioral Sciences pulled her back . No outpost in L.A. anymore . So , yes , I talked to her . But over the phone at Quantico . She ran it through the computer and got zilched . As far as a profile goes or anything else , I 'm on a waiting list . Do you know that across the country there were thirty-four millennium inspired murders on New Year 's Eve and New Year 's Day ? So they have their hands full at the moment and the bigger departments like us , we 're at the end of the line because the bureau figures the smaller departments with less experience and expertise and manpower need their help more . " She waited a moment while letting McCaleb consider all of this . He understood the Bureau 's philosophy . It was a form of triage . " I do n't mind waiting a month or so until Maggie or somebody else over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut on this one tells me time is a consideration , Terry . If it is a serial , a month may be too long to wait . That 's why I thought of coming to you . I am banging my head on the wall on this one and you might be our last best hope of coming up with something to move on now . I still remember the Cemetery Man and the Code Killer . I know what you can do with a murder book and some crime scene tape . " The last few lines were gratuitous and her only false move so far , McCaleb thought . Otherwise he believed she was sincere in the expression of her belief that the killer she was looking for might strike again . " It 's been a long time for me , Jaye , " McCaleb began . " Other than that thing with Graciela 's sister , I have n't been involved in " " Come on , Terry , do n't bullshit me , okay ? You can sit here with a baby in your lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erase what you were and what you did . I know you . We have n't seen each other or talked in a long time but I know you . And I know that not a day goes by that you do n't think about cases . Not a day . " She paused and stared at him . " When they took out your heart , they did n't take out what makes you tick , know what I mean ? " McCaleb looked away from her and back down at his boat . Buddy was now sitting in the main fighting chair , his feet up on the transom . McCaleb assumed he had a beer in his hand but it was too far to see that . " If you 're so good at reading people , what do you need me for ? " " I may be good but you 're the best I ever knew . Hell , even if they were n't backed up till Easter in Quantico , I 'd take you over any of those profilers . I mean that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need a sales pitch , okay ? My ego is doing okay without all the . " " Then what do you need ? " He looked back at her . " Just some time . I need to think about this . " " l 'm here because my gut says I do n't have much time . " McCaleb got up and walked to the railing . His gaze was out to the sea . A Catalina Express ferry was coming in . He knew it would be almost empty . The winter months brought few visitors . " The boat 's coming in , " he said . " It 's the winter schedule , Jaye . You better catch it going back or you 'll be here all night . " " I'II have dispatch send a chopper for me if I have to . Terry , all I need from you is one day at the most . One night , even . Tonight . You sit down , read the book , look at the tape and then call me in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least nothing that 's new . But maybe you 'll see something we 've missed or you 'll get an idea we have n't come up with yet . That 's all I 'm asking . I do n't think it 's a lot . " McCaleb looked away from the incoming boat and turned so his back leaned against the rail . " It does n't seem like a lot to you because you 're in the life . I 'm not . I 'm out of it , Jaye . Even going back into it for a day is going to change things . I moved out here to start over and to forget all the stuff I was good at . To get good at being something else . At being a father and a husband , for starters . " Winston got up and walked to the railing . She stood next to him but looked out at the view while he remained facing his home . She spoke in a low voice . If Graciela was listening from somewhere inside , she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you told me ? You told me you got a second shot at life and that there had to be a reason for it . Now you 've built this life with her sister and her son and now even your own child . That 's wonderful , Terry , I really think so . But that ca n't be the reason you were looking for . You might think it is but it 's not . Deep down you know it . You were good at catching these people . Next to that , what is catching fish ? " McCaleb nodded slightly and was uncomfortable with himself for doing it so readily . " Leave the stuff , " he said . " I'II call you when I can . " On the way to the door Winston looked about for Graciela but did n't see her . " She 's probably in with the baby , " McCaleb said . " Well , tell her I said goodbye . " " I will . " There was an awkward silence the rest of the way to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So what 's it like , Terry ? Being a father . " " It 's the best of times , it 's the worst of times . " His stock answer . He then thought a moment and then added something he had thought about but never said , not even to Graciela . " It 's like having a gun to your head all the time . " Winston looked confused and maybe even a little concerned . " How so ? " " Because I know if anything ever happens to her , anything , then my life is over . " She nodded . " I think I can understand that . " She went through the door . She looked rather silly as she left . A seasoned homicide detective riding away in a golf cart .
