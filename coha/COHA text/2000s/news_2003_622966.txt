<p> YOU COULD venture out to Point Reyes this morning and feel as if you had the park 's 71,000 acres all to yourself  --  even though 2.5 million people visit Point Reyes National Seashore each year . <p> " You 'd be hard-pressed to find anybody on many of the trails , and even the roads and the beaches , " said John Dell'Osso at park headquarters . <p> Come the weekend , all that changes , not only at Point Reyes , but at other Bay Area parks , lakes , country roads and fishing spots on the bay . Your soothing weekday visit with Dr. Jekyll can turn into a weekend nightmare with Mr. Hyde . When it comes to the great outdoors , everybody shows up at once : on good-weather weekend afternoons . <p> " It often seems that there 's nobody out there during the week , especially in the mornings , " said Ned MacKay , a retired writer who has visited more than 100 Bay Area parks , including all 60 in Alameda and Contra Costa counties . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'll be a lot of people in the parks on the weekends . " <p> In a review of Bay Area outdoor recreation as 2003 gets under way , the news is mostly good , providing your timing is , too . <p> The Bay Area has roughly 150 significant parks with about 7,500 miles of trails , 20 waterfalls , a dozen mountain peaks with stellar lookouts , 10 redwood forests , 45 lakes with public access and 15 providing good fishing , 20 fishing piers , 100 miles of ocean frontage with dozens of secluded beaches , the bay and its open waters and half-dozen islands , 50 campgrounds including 20 secluded hike-in sites , 1,500 miles of waterways for boating and among the best salmon fishing , mountain biking and boating tours in North America . <p> But it also has nearly 7 million residents . It seems they are all on the same schedule . <p> " I see all the traffic on the U.S. 101 corridor , " Dell'Osso said . " But it 's not out here during the week . " An independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two 6-hour blocks on Saturdays and Sundays . <p> It is much the same for parks elsewhere in the Bay Area . <p> While park districts debate over budget cuts , maintenance , delayed repairs to infrastructure and frugal salaries , the issues are far more simple for the public : How 's the weather ? How bad is the traffic ? How many people are out there ? <p> Well , you want a park all to yourself ? Then finagle a visit on a weekday morning . <p> That done , here is a region-by-region look at the best of the Bay Area outdoors for 2003 , and for dreamers , a wish list for the future : <p> SAN FRANCISCO &; PENINSULA <p> San Francisco and the Peninsula provide more wide-reaching opportunities for recreation than any other large city in North America . <p> In San Francisco , the Golden Gate Promenade and the Coastal Trail link Fort Mason , Marina Green and Crissy Field to the Presidio and Land 's End . This is one of the most scenic walks/bike trips/jogging routes of any city anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature tours and scenic cruises . <p> The Peninsula is sprinkled with dozens of parks and crowned by the beauty of the coastal mountains . This area spans from San Bruno and Sweeney Ridge on south to Sky Londa and past the Palo Alto foothills into the Santa Cruz Mountains , with more than 20 trailheads along Skyline Boulevard to help explore it . In July , the Bay Ridge Trail will open in the Crystal Springs watershed , providing access to previously unseen gems . This will be a landmark event . <p>  --  Best hidden spot : Crystal Springs watershed . <p>  --  Dream list : Access on existing service road that links Sweeney Ridge to Montara Mountain ; sharply restricted lottery-style fishing program for catch-and-release ( from boat only ) at Crystal Springs , San Andreas and Pilarcitos lakes ; water level restored at Lake Merced ; access to Stanford lands at Felt Lake ; parking at Golden Gate Park . <p> MARIN <p> Some people get tunnel vision from the heavy traffic and dense strip of humanity from Sausalito on past San Rafael and north to Novato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can launch off across a landscape that feature wildlands , lakes and coast . <p> The crown jewel is Point Reyes and its opportunities for hiking , wildlife viewing and backpack-style camping . It borders Tomales Bay , where kayaking , boat-in camping and elk spotting at Pierce Ranch are unequaled in California . <p> Yet Mount Tamalpais ( and its watershed lands ) seems to loom everywhere . It is the heart of a landscape that provides much of best hiking , mountain biking , fishing , waterfalls and prettiest lakes in the Bay Area . In addition , the Marin Headlands provide some of the best views and photography of the Golden Gate , as well as hidden campgrounds and excellent bike rides . The fishing is often outstanding in San Pablo Bay for striped bass and sturgeon . <p>  --  Best hidden spot : Napa-Sonoma Marsh Wildlife Area . <p>  --  Dream list : Fishing programs and access for hand-launched boats at Bon Tempe , Alpine , Kent and Nicasio lakes ; a one-way loop trail with use restricted only to mountain bikes on Mount Tam ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tam 's East Peak ; improved access for kayaks and canoes at Estero de Limantour ; anchored barges required to be lighted at night on San Pablo Bay . <p> ALAMEDA &; CONTRA COSTA <p> No matter where one might live in the East Bay , you are within 15 minutes of a park or open space preserve . The East Bay Regional Park District has become a national model of how to protect greenbelt . It now manages 59 parks covering more than 91,000 acres , with 1,200 miles of trails for hiking , biking and horseback riding . My personal favorites are San Pablo Reservoir , Sunol Regional Wilderness , Black Diamond Mines Preserve , Morgan Territory , Diablo 's second summit , Franklin Ridge , Wildcat and the 31-mile East Bay National Skyline Trail . <p> Mount Diablo is the crown jewel , and from here you overlook the Delta and its outstanding boating opportunities and world-class bass fishing . <p> These two East Bay counties have 15 lakes with public access , including six with significant fishing programs , 100 miles of bay shoreline with six marinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive wetlands that act as sanctuaries for thousands of waterfowl and marine birds . <p>  --  Best hidden spot : Ohlone Regional Wilderness . <p>  --  Dream list : Rangers hired to open Vasco Caves near Brentwood , Vargas Plateau near Fremont and the rest of Carquinez Strait Regional Shoreline ; more restrictive policies on cattle grazing on park lands ; biking and hiking access to service roads on watershed lands ; fishing access to Briones , Upper San Leandro and Calaveras reservoirs . <p> SANTA CLARA &; SANTA CRUZ <p> The Santa Clara Valley has long been packed wall-to-wall with people , development and cars . Yet bordering the western valley is the Sierra Azul Range , which leads up to 3,486-foot Mount Umunhum , and , to the northwest , the Santa Cruz Mountains . <p> There are 35 parks and preserves here , highlighted by a sea of conifers in the Santa Cruz Mountains that spans roughly 750 square miles across wilderness-like valleys and ridges . The highlight is the 34-mile Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail , the Bay Area 's best backpacking trip , featuring access to the prettiest spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in Big Basin Redwoods , and its three sensational waterfalls . <p> To the east of the valley is the Mount Hamilton Range , spanning north to the Diablo Range and south to the Gavilan Range . At its most remote reaches is Henry W. Coe State Park , covering 86,000 acres , larger than the land mass of San Francisco . <p> In all there are 35 parks , open space preserves and wildlife refuges along the South Bay and a dozen lakes . The latter include the best bass fishing in the Bay Area , at Coyote Reservoir . <p>  --  Best hidden spot : Rooster Comb in Henry Coe State Park . <p>  --  Dream list : Mountain bike connector route from Portola State Park to Butano Rim ; water tanks at backpack sites in Santa Cruz Mountains ; formal bass enhancement programs at Lexington , Anderson , Calero , Uvas and Coyote reservoirs ; access to Henry Coe wilderness at Bell Station ; boat ramps opened on South Bay at Palo Alto and Alviso . <p> PARK CONTACTS <p>  --  Golden Gate National Recreation Area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94123 ; ( 415 ) 556-4700 ; www.nps.gov/goga.  --  Marin Headlands Visitor Center , Building 948 , Fort Barry , Sausalito , Calif. 94965 ; ( 415 ) 331-1540 ; www.nps.gov/goga.  --  California State Parks , Bay Area District , 250 Executive Park Blvd. , Suite 4900 San Francisco , Calif. 94134 ; ( 415 ) 330-6300 ; www.parks.ca.gov then click on Pick A Park .  --  Other state park districts : Silverado District : ( 707 ) 938-1519 ; Marin District : ( 415 ) 893-1580 ; Santa Cruz District : ( 831 ) 429-2851.  --  Point Reyes National Seashore , Point Reyes Station , Calif. 94956 ; ( 415 ) 464-5100 ; camping line , ( 415 ) 663-8054 ; www.nps.gov/pore.  --  Marin Municipal Water District , 220 Nellen Avenue , Corte Madera , Calif. 94925 ; ( 415 ) 945-1455 ; Sky Oaks Ranger Station , ( 415 ) 945-1181 ; www.marinwater.org.  --  East Bay Regional Park District , 2950 Peralta Oaks Court , P.O.
