<p> There was also a former Texas congressman . The president of Friends of the Earth . A onetime associate of ex-junk bond king Michael Milken . A former Dallas police chief . A member of the University of California Board of Regents . And a retired teacher from an exclusive Washington prep school . <p> They and others collectively invested and lost millions of dollars in what a string of federal and state lawsuits charged were Ponzi schemes in which Earls or companies he controlled diverted funds to pay debts and fund other ventures . <p> A review of the lawsuits and interviews with investors , attorneys and others portrays Earls , 57 , as a Jekyll and Hyde : an affable Washington financier and CEO who networked with the wealthy and influential at fundraisers , then was sued by some of those same people for allegedly bogus investments in succeeding days . <p> In a Delaware court ruling earlier this year , a judge wrote that civil actions filed over several investment deals run by Earls marshaled evidence of " a pattern that may rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former Milken associate who sued an Earls-controlled firm for over $ 4 million in the Delaware case , offered a similar , if less damning , view in a court deposition . " Every single thing he said he would do , he failed to do , " said Ackerman . " I 've been around this business for 25 years , and I 've been involved with people of all different kinds and characters . This man is six standard deviations from the mean in terms of truth-telling . " <p> Earls says he 's being unfairly portrayed by some of the investors who sued him when speculative business ventures did n't pan out as projected . He stressed that most of the lawsuits , more than 20 in federal or state courts over the last two decades , were settled with no finding of wrongdoing . <p> " If you were Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch . . . if you looked at all the lawsuits filed against them over the years , there would be thousands , " said Earls . " It 's a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the national spotlight might never have come Earls ' way . With the White House 's blessing , Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt recruited Webster early last month as chairman of a new national board to oversee the accounting industry . <p> The Bush administration was n't the first suitor for the ex-G-man 's sterling credentials . Earls had previously enlisted Webster to join former Senate majority leader George Mitchell and other luminaries on the board of U.S. Technologies , a struggling Washington software and information technology firm where Earls is the CEO and one of the largest shareholders . <p> Pitt , however , neglected to warn the White House that Webster had told him about fraud allegations against U.S. Technologies . The omission led to the resignations of Pitt from the SEC and Webster from the accounting board . Webster also lost money on the plummeting price of U.S. Technologies stock and options . The departures left Earls as the last remaining actor in the drama about the accounting board . <p> His 15 minutes of financial fame have n't quite expired . Federal prosecutors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealings , people familiar with the inquiry said . Earls said he could not discuss the matter . <p> Lights , camera . . . <p> Some of the financier 's early business ventures involved movie deals he said functioned as tax shelters for investors . He produced The Pilot , a 1979 film which actor Cliff Robertson directed and starred in as a veteran aviator with an alcohol problem . <p> Robertson did not respond to a message left with his agent . Earls said the film flopped at the box office , but did well on television . A TV Guide online review , however , panned it as a " dreary drama . " <p> Earls nonetheless used his film business experience in a proposed deal to produce several movies during the late 1980s . Three wealthy Philadelphia-area businessmen invested $ 75,000 in the venture , based in part on what their attorney , John Innelli , described as Earls ' claims of involvement with a firm that held the rights to three soon-to-be-produced screenplays . <p> The investors sued Earls , a company he controlled and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was produced . The lawsuit , settled by Earls and other defendants with no admission of wrongdoing , described the deal as " a complete fraud , designed to induce investors to purchase interests in non-existent or shell partnerships . " <p> Other lawsuits filed against Earls and companies he controlled contained similar allegations that Earls created a maze of self-controlled partnerships and limited liability companies and enlisted investors for an eclectic range of business ventures . Court records show the deals included a proposed takeover of the Greyhound Lines bus company , a Franklin National Bank investment , a car and medical loan business called Jayhawk Acceptance and stock investments in U.S. Technologies . <p> Former Texas congressman John Bryant got to know Earls in part through the financier 's mid-1990s involvement in the Texas-Louisiana Baseball League , one of several independent minor leagues around the nation . Earls helped promote the financially troubled league , even recruiting ABC-TV commentator George Will , a devoted baseball fan , as commissioner . <p> Bryant , former Dallas police chief Billy Prince and former Dallas deputy chief Harold Warren were among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A complaint filed in Washington Superior court accused the financier of falsely telling investors he would put $ 3.5 million of his own into the deal , which was organized through several Earls-controlled companies . <p> According to the complaint , Earls ' business pitch involved purchasing a 9.9% stock stake in Greyhound and taking the company private in a friendly deal . Then , the investors would sell off its undervalued real estate , take the bus service upscale and go public at a higher stock value , the complaint says . <p> The investors filed the lawsuit against Earls and his companies in 2000 after he allegedly stalled requests for detailed financial records and their money . The action accused Earls of persuading the group to invest in " nothing more than a pipe dream  --  a sham scheme that never was intended to take place and had no realistic basis . " <p> Michael Lenett , Washington lawyer for the investors , argued that bank and brokerage records showed Earls and his companies never put up the promised money . Instead , the lawsuit charged , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect , as they came in the front door , to his own bank accounts and those of his controlled entities out the back door . " <p> The Superior Court lawsuit also charged that the scheme enabled Earls to stave off creditors , weather a costly divorce battle with ex-wife Elizabeth Sinclair and maintain control of real estate assets such as Washington 's exclusive Georgetown Club , which was later sold for approximately $ 3 million . <p> George Marcus , a University of California Board of Regents member , charged in a separate lawsuit filed in Washington federal court that Earls misappropriated money from the Greyhound deal to buy U.S. Technologies stock and consolidate his control of that firm . Earls challenged the accusation , then agreed to a confidential settlement in December 2000 , attorneys for Marcus said . <p> A good impression <p> What persuaded the wealthy and influential to invest in Earls ' ventures ? <p> " He appeared to be a very smooth individual who was quite successful , " said Warren , the former Dallas deputy police chief . " He was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father of four met some of his business contacts on the social circuit or at the St. Albans School , an elite Washington prep school where his children studied with the offspring of influential capital area families . <p> Washington Life , a magazine that chronicles the area 's fundraisers and benefits , has published several photos of Earls hobnobbing at benefits for such organizations as the Washington Ballet and National Gallery of Art . <p> " He helped us raise a lot of money and was very active in helping us recruit a very influential board , " said Patricia Shannon , president and CEO of the Boys &; Girls Clubs of Greater Washington . <p> Thomas Wilds , CEO of St. John 's Community Services , a large , Washington-based non-profit that serves children and adults with disabilities , said Earls ' volunteer work and fundraising as a board member and board president helped the agency expand its efforts into five states . " In many respects , our progress in the civil rights field is largely due to Greg , " he said . <p> Wilds said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency to invest in business ventures . " It did n't interfere with the assistance he was giving me or the agency , " said Wilds . <p> Earls himself says his activism for St. John 's , fundraising for the University of Virginia , his alma mater , and other volunteer work does n't square with the allegations in the lawsuits . " You 've got to ask yourself , can all the bad things that are said about me possibly be true ? " he asked . <p> But others offer a more cynical view of the networking . " He deliberately gets himself into these charitable things . It 's his cover , " said Lenett . <p> Edward Eagles , a now-retired St. Albans School history and economics teacher , was impressed by the financier when Earls volunteered to speak at a school class . Eagles invested $ 550,000 in a series of Earls-run ventures in the 1990s , a decision he later regretted . <p> Eagles prevailed in a lawsuit and arbitration that accused Earls or entities he controlled of fraudulently shifting investment funds through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal expenses and ventures . Despite a continuing legal battle  --  including an unsuccessful effort to garnish Earls ' U.S. Technologies income  --  Eagles has recouped only a portion of his losses . He declined to comment publicly . <p> Earls said the many lawsuits and negative fallout from the Webster episode had caused him personal pain and made it harder for U.S. Technologies to raise capital . But Earls predicted he and the business would emerge successful . <p> The same ca n't necessarily be said for some of the investors who have sued the financier . <p> A Washington Superior Court complaint filed in September alleged that Earls and a company he controlled defaulted on a $ 431,000 payment note promised to Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder and his family . Their attorney , Bruce Terris , said the Blackwelders lost money on a bad investment with Earls but have recovered nothing . <p> " The process of getting lawyers and fighting hand to hand is so expensive that he almost always has the upper hand , " said Terris .
