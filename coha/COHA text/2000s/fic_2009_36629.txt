The baby in the carrier slept peacefully , tiny fists thrust against her chubby cheeks blissfully unaware of her danger . Pia Westola clicked off the phone and sat back in her chair , gazing at the baby , sick with the awareness of this new , undesirable turn her life had taken . What had started out as a job she could believe in-even if it did sometimes drift into the law 's gray areas-had just become clearly criminal . She would never have agreed to take this infant if what Florence had just told her was true . <p> One glance at the clock told her her boss would be here soon . Pia just had to keep the little one out of his reach . Adrenaline pulsed through her at the thought . Her decision made , she slipped on her coat , adjusted the insulating cover over the baby carrier that fit on her like a backpack , then grabbed the bottles and diapers and stuffed them in with the baby . If she could hide out long enough , maybe she could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage door , she heard a car out front . Peeking through the curtains , she saw him get out . His car blocked Pia 's getaway . Biting back panic , she realized she 'd have to escape through the kitchen door . <p> She exited quickly with the baby and stood on the porch . She knew she had to hurry , but which direction ? He 'd see her on the road . Her only hope was through the thigh-high drifts across her backyard and into the woods . Her cross-country skis were propped against the side of the house . She shouldered into the baby backpack , slung the diaper bag over that , and then snapped on her skis . <p> She set out across the frozen landscape . Her muscles were warm by the time she reached the edge of the woods , and her breath fogged the frigid air . But she 'd reached the path other skiers had used , and the going would be easier . <p> Her back aching from the weight of the carrier , she spared a glance behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . He was on skis too . She 'd forgotten he always carried them in his car . He was n't burdened with the baby either . She was never going to make the sanctuary she 'd hoped for . He had n't seen her yet though . She hoped he 'd lose her tracks on the more highly trafficked trail . <p> Tension coiled along Pia 's spine as she whirled and looked for a place to hide the baby . There-a fallen pile of logs had enough space under it to hide the infant . She slipped out of the backpack , and a crumpled piece of paper fell from her pocket . She wedged the carrier under the logs . She layered several insulated blankets around the tiny girl . At least the child was sheltered . <p> Picking up a branch , she erased the evidence of her tracks to the logs . She stared down the hill at the approaching figure , then retraced her steps . She met him at a bend in the trail . She 'd never known him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His narrowed gaze nearly cut her down . " Where 's the baby ? " <p> She tipped up her chin . " I 'm not going to be part of this . " <p> He grabbed her arm and twisted it . " Where is she ? " <p> Reeling from the shock , Pia 's shoulder shrieked with pain . Still , she held his gaze defiantly . " Where you 'll never find her . " <p> " I saw you carrying her ! " He slapped her , then slapped her again . Both hands moved to her shoulders and he shook her . " Where is she ? " <p> Pia 's cheeks burned . Her head flopped with the violence of the shaking . Then he shoved her , and she was falling , falling toward a broken tree limb that jutted from the ground like a giant spear . <p> Chapter Two Davy came barreling downstairs with his red hair sticking up . Bree Matthews swiped at it as he passed . " Hey , big guy , you want cereal or an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He went to the table and pulled the cereal bowl toward him , then dumped Cheerios into it . <p> She glanced out at the sun glinting off the thick snowdrifts , then saw the clock on the stove . " Miss Florence is expecting you in twenty minutes . " <p> " It 's the start of the winter holiday , Mom . I like Miss Florence , but I 'd rather go fishing with you . Ca n't I skip tutoring today ? " <p> She frowned at his reluctance . She 'd never known him to be less than eager to go to Florence 's . " We 'll go fishing this afternoon . " <p> When had he started to call her Mom instead of Mommy ? She should have noted the transition . Now she mourned it . He would be a young man the next time she blinked . Nearly eight years old . Where had the time gone ? He rarely needed her help now . Not with breakfast or getting ready for school . His bed would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . <p> Just as Rob had been . <p> It fascinated her to consider how much of Davy 's qualities she could credit to heredity and how much to environment . Even though he looked like her , he walked like Rob and he had Rob 's cowlick at his forehead . He was a neatnik and he loved trains , just like his dad . His favorite color was green , and nearly every shirt he owned was a variation of that shade , as were Rob 's , the ones she 'd given to the Salvation Army after his death . <p> She snapped out of her trance when Kade walked with a heavy tread into the kitchen . He brushed a kiss across her forehead . " Morning , hon , " he said before continuing on to the table . " I wish it were Saturday instead of Monday . I 'd like to go fishing with you two . " <p> " Breakfast ? " she asked . " I 'm in the mood to cook . " <p> He smiled . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got a busy day at work . " <p> " I do n't mind , " she said , her spirits deflating . She 'd hoped he would remember her doctor appointment without being reminded . He 'd change his plans and go with her if she asked , but he 'd been so distracted lately she hated to add to whatever burden he was n't sharing with her . <p> He ruffled Davy 's hair . " Looking forward to your winter holiday ? " <p> " You bet ! " <p> Bree turned to the stove and whipped him up an omelet-his favorite kind , with spinach , mushrooms , ham , and cheese . The coffee aroma filled the kitchen , and then the pot beeped . Bree poured him a cup and handed it to him . He grunted a thank-you from behind his newspaper . <p> She would not cry . She turned back to the stove and flipped the omelet over . These days she felt on the verge of tears most of the time . Probably the fertility drugs . Sliding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kade . <p> He looked up . " Thanks , babe . " He caught her hand and kissed her palm . <p> The love in his gaze soothed her . Were they ever going to have their own baby ? They 'd both been devastated when she miscarried three months ago . Glancing at the calendar again , she started to ask him about going with her today , then shut her mouth . No , it was n't a big enough deal . <p> When Kade pulled her close before he left for work , she almost changed her mind . If the news was bad today , she might need his strength . It took all her determination to nuzzle her face in his neck and keep back the words . <p> Once Kade was out of the house , she grabbed her keys . " I 'll run you to Miss Florence 's . " She snapped her fingers , and her search dog , Samson , got up and came to her . His dark eyes were eager , and he ran to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast tract of forest where Florence Hawkins lived , Bree glanced at her son several times . " You okay , buddy ? You 're quiet this morning . " <p> " I dreamed about Daddy last night , " he said . " He told me to watch for him , that he was coming . " <p> Bree hid her wince , but her fingers tightened on the steering wheel as she navigated the icy curves in the road . " You know that 's not possible , Davy . " He scowled . " Do n't call me Davy , " he said . " I 'm not a baby . " <p> He 'd always be her baby . " Your daddy is in heaven . He 'd come for you if he could , but he ca n't . " <p> Her boy 's mouth turned mutinous . " Maybe he could come see me as a ghost . I would n't be afraid . I heard a cry outside the window last night and got up to look . I thought it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway behind Florence 's bright yellow convertible . " Maybe you were dreaming . You know there are no ghosts . Your daddy did n't want to go to heaven when he did , but you have to accept he 's gone , son . " <p> She 'd thought these discussions were long past . Rob had been gone for almost four years . She and Kade had been married for two , and Kade had been such a good father to Davy . His visits to the psychologist had tapered off to a couple per year , and they 'd all thought her boy had made the adjustment . Now she was n't so sure . <p> There was no more time to talk now . Florence met them at the door . In her fifties with dyed red hair , she was a kid magnet . She 'd been a teacher for years , and she tutored children in town . Davy 's grade in math had come up to an A since Bree hired her . <p> Davy glanced up at his tutor . " Miss Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smile faltered . <p> Bree frowned . " Baby ? " she asked Florence . <p> The older woman waved her hand . " I think he means the doll I keep for the little girls . I could n't find it last week . " She turned to face the street . " Oh , here comes Timmy , " she said . <p> Davy turned on the stoop . " Yay ! " he yelled as Naomi O'Reilly , Bree 's best friend , pulled up in her minivan . The van stopped and Timmy climbed out . The boy lugged his backpack and joined Davy on the stoop . <p> Naomi stuck her head out of the window , and her long braid slipped along her shoulder . " Hey , can Dave come for a playdate this afternoon ? " <p> Davy 's smile beamed . Even Naomi remembered he hated to be called Davy . " Sure , after we go fishing , right Dave ? " Bree said . She glanced at her son as he ran back to Florence . <p> " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . " You ready for your lessons , boys ? " <p> " You bet ! " the two boys said in chorus . They scampered into the house and toward the kitchen . <p> " Work hard and we 'll go fishing this afternoon ! " Bree called after him . Samson pressed against her leg , and she plunged her cold fingers into his warm fur . <p> " They 're doing so well , " Florence said . " You can be very proud of your boy . " She closed the door . <p> Bree jogged to the idling van to talk to Naomi . She smiled at Naomi 's toddler in the backseat . Matthew 's gummy smile made her own widen . <p> " Is something wrong ? " Naomi asked . <p> " Just a weird day . I 've been thinking about Rob , and Davy was talking about him this morning . It made me sad for a minute . " <p> Matthew wailed . Naomi flipped her braid behind her and pulled her head back into the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before facing Bree again . " You 've got nothing to regret , Bree . You were a good wife to Rob , but he 's gone . You 've got Kade now , and a better man has never walked the face of the earth . Other than my Donovan , of course , " she said , smiling . <p> " Of course . " Bree returned her friend 's smile , feeling the weight fall from her shoulders . " We landed our Westleys . " <p> " ' Wuv , twue wuv , ' " Naomi said , mimicking the Impressive Clergyman in The Princess Bride , their favorite movie . <p> They both burst into giggles . " I 'll be praying for you ! " Naomi shouted before running up her window and pulling away in the van . <p> A smile still pulled at Bree 's lips when the car disappeared around the curve . The stiff wind blew snow into the tracks left by Naomi 's vehicle . Life seemed to be doing the same to Bree , the winds of change obscuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . <p> As she left Rock Harbor , she saw people parked along the frozen shoreline . They stared and pointed out across the frozen water . What had captured everyone 's attention ? Then she saw it . <p> An ice volcano . Sometimes high surf slamming against the face of the ice shelf created a cone formation resembling a volcano . The ice built up , and the surge of waves erupted through the cone like lava through a volcano tube . It was always a sight to see , so she drove slowly and did her own amount of staring until she left Rock Harbor 's city limits behind . <p> Driving to Houghton , where her doctor 's office was located , she felt the knot in her belly tighten with every mile . She 'd handled worse than this by herself . Turning on her CD player , she cranked up her favorite Elvis album , Elvis in Concert , and fast-forwarded to " Ca n't Help Falling in Love . " In her mind that was Kade 's song , and the lyrics strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the fears . She left Samson in the Jeep when she parked . All eyes turned to look when she walked into the ob-gyn office . Most of the women were pregnant , and Bree saw their eyes drop to her belly . She swallowed her hurt and smiled as she checked in at the window , then sank into a black leather chair nearby . If nothing else , it was good to be out of the cold . She slipped off her coat and laid it across her knees . <p> She 'd barely had time to warm up when the nurse called her name . Her pulse ratcheted up a notch as she followed the nurse down a long hallway lined with pictures of smiling mothers holding newborns . She kept her gaze firmly latched on to the nurse 's back . It hurt too much to see those photos . The nurse led her to an examination room , then took her blood pressure and pulse before leaving Bree behind the closed door to await the doctor . <p> Bree had waited here too many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe she would give it up . This path was so difficult . <p> The door opened , and Dr. Zook walked in . About fifty , the female doctor had been Bree 's ob-gyn ever since Bree moved to the area . The stylish pumps , khaki slacks , and red-and-khaki striped blouse she wore fit her slim frame impeccably . Her pageboy blonde hair swung in a perfect curtain to her chin . Bree always felt dowdy in her doctor 's presence . <p> " Good morning , Bree , " the doctor said . She carried a manila file . Perching on a stool , she flipped it open and studied the top sheet of paper . " How are you feeling ? " <p> " Fine . No problems . I started my period last week . " She could n't keep the disappointment from her voice . " I 've been on Clomid two months . This will be the last month you said I should take it . " <p> Dr. Zook closed the file , crossed one crisp pant leg over the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at Bree . " I have the test results back . There 's no obvious reason why you are n't conceiving . " <p> That sounded like good news . " What do you suggest ? " <p> " We could try another few months of Clomid , but you might want to jump directly to in vitro . " <p> Bree suspected in vitro was way too expensive for them . " I got pregnant before . " <p> " And miscarried at seven weeks , " Dr. Zook said . " The problem may be genetic . With in vitro , we could maximize your chances and have fifteen or so fertilized eggs to test for problems . " <p> Bree shook her head . " I 'd want to implant every fertilized egg . It 's for God to decide the outcome . " Dr. Zook 's face remained impassive , but Bree knew the doctor did n't agree with her stand . " How much does it cost ? " <p> " About five thousand dollars a month . I 'd guess we might have success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll need to talk to my husband . " How on earth could they afford something like that ? Tears hovered dangerously close when the doctor left Bree alone . Maybe she and Kade would never have a child together . <p> He claimed to love Davy like he was Kade 's own flesh and blood , and Bree knew it was true . But she saw his stares at small children and the way he fielded questions from kids who came through park headquarters . If ever a man was cut out to be a father , it was Kade Matthews . <p> She gathered up her purse and slipped on her coat in a daze . Clutching her purse , she walked back down the hall and through the waiting room . A newborn baby mewled in her mother 's arms as Bree neared the exit . She had to look , and her heart melted at the sight of a rosebud mouth and smooth , perfect skin . The Native American baby had the biggest thatch of black hair that Bree had ever seen . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother smiled and thanked Bree , who quickly escaped into the harsh wind that scoured the tears from her face . <p> * * * <p> Kade glanced out his office window into the back lot . There were no baby animals in the rescue area that he was so proud of , but come spring , the pens would be full . <p> Judith Kettrick stuck her head in the door . " You hear the report ? " The ranger-brown of her uniform accentuated her sallow complexion . <p> Kade turned from the window . " What report ? " He hoped she had n't gotten her pink slip . The place was becoming a ghost town since the budget cuts . <p> " A woman on the reservation reported her baby was taken by a windigo . " <p> Kade raised an eyebrow . " Windigo ? Why would she say that ? " Windigos were the Ojibwa Indians ' version of a vampire . The evil spirit was said to have an insatiable hunger . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
