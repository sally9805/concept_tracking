BUCKINGHAM PALACE . REBECCA MARSHALL still could n't believe she was going to be living there . She 'd known for a week , but the reality of it simply had n't sunk in . But now here she was . <p> Becoming a maid of honor at Queen Victoria 's court was the biggest surprise she 'd ever had in all of her eighteen years . Her mother , Lilly , had been hoping for this elite position to be bestowed on her daughter , but Lilly had n't told Rebecca that she 'd called in a few favors to obtain it . She had n't wanted Rebecca to be disappointed if it did n't come to pass . <p> Rebecca would n't have been disappointed . She 'd never even considered being a maid of honor at the royal court . But she knew that it was something her mother had aspired to . Lilly often spoke of her lost chance to be a maid of honor , or even a lady of the bedchamber once she 'd become a married woman . Her family had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whigs in power , controlling all of the court appointments , Lilly had been unable to achieve her fondest wish and had finally given it up . After all , the Whig political party had retained power for a long time . <p> But now the Tories , more recently called Conservatives , were finally back in office , with Sir Robert Peel as the new prime minister . Out with the old , in with the new , as it were . With new appointments being made , Lilly had quickly petitioned party officials for an appointment for Rebecca . There was no guarantee that Rebecca would receive one as there were n't many appointments to be had . But the letter had arrived ast week . And like an excitable young girl , Rebecca 's mother had actually shouted for joy after reading it , she had been so thrilled . And her excitement had been contagious . <p> The last week had been a whirlwind . Mother and daughter had only just started planning for Rebecca 's come-out in London during the next winter Season , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of having her new wardrobe designed , with nothing created yet ! So many extra seamstresses had to be hired , and decisions had to be made quickly . There were trips back and forth to the nearby town of Norford , sometimes two or three trips a day . And underlying it all was the excitement and Lilly 's nonstop chatter about this being the most golden opportunity of Rebecca 's life . <p> It was also going to be the biggest change in Rebecca 's life since her father 's passing . The Earl of Ryne had died when she was only eight . Lilly had never entertained the idea of remarrying . The earl 's title had gone to a male relative of his , but the manor near Norford where Rebecca had grown up was n't entailed . She 'd spent her whole life there , had n't even gone off for her schooling as had some of her closer friends . Lilly had n't been willing to part with her , so she had arranged for Rebecca to have the best teachers right there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed her and her mother to spend a lot of time together . Both adept horsewomen , they rode nearly every day when the weather was good . Rebecca was going to miss that . With both of them having so many friends in Norford , there was always someone stopping y to visit , or some social gathering to attend . Rebecca was going to miss that , too . But they would n't be so far apart . Norford was only a few hours ' ride north of London . However , Lilly was determined to give Rebecca some time to get settled in and used to her position , before she visited . She did n't want to appear to be an overprotective mother , even if she was ! <p> Actually , this appointment to the queen 's court would be the second golden opportunity for Rebecca that mother and daughter had extensively discussed . The first had arisen five years ago when they were in complete agreement on their first choice for Rebecca 's future husband . No need for a Seasonal launch if she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , Raphael Locke , the Duke of Norford 's heir . So convenient ! But the esteemed fellow had up and married someone else before Rebecca was old enough to put herself forward , and that had ended that . <p> Such a shame . She had been looking forward to being a part of that interesting family . Preston Locke , the duke , had five sisters , all married and living elsewhere now , but they often returned to Norford for visits . Lilly had told stories about the days when most of those ladies had still lived at home and how the Lockes had quite dominated the local society , and in fact some of the grander parties Rebecca had attended had been at Norford Hall when she was a child . She had almost got closer to that family when she became friends with the youngest daughter of the house , Amanda Locke . It was too bad they had lost touch with each other after Amanda was sent off to private school . <p> The duke had n't entertained much after that because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife had died years ago , and while every available lady in the neighborhood had probably tried to catch his eye over the years , he remained a widower . But Ophelia Locke did the entertaining there now , the woman who had captured Raphael 's heart before Rebecca could ! <p> Two lost opportunities in that illustrious family , a best friend and a husband . But this new opportunity was upon her . A maid of honor at Queen Victoria 's court ! Rebecca knew all the benefits . Holding the position was comparable to attending the most elite finishing school in the world . She 'd be meeting the most important people in England and royalty from across the Continent . There was no reason to wait for a Season if you were part of a court with a queen who loved to entertain . If Rebecca was lucky , the queen might even have a hand in picking her future husband . Anything was possible . <p> Miraculously , Rebecca 's wardrobe was finished in time for her departure for London and was much grander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilly had spared no expense . And she accompanied Rebecca and her maid , Flora , to London . <p> It was n't the first time Rebecca was seeing London . There had been a few shopping excursions over the years , a horse race Lilly just had to attend since the sire of her mare was racing that day , the wedding of an old friend Lilly had been invited to , and , of course , Rebecca had joined her on all of those trips . But this was the first time she was seeing Buckingham Palace . There had been no reason to visit it before when no monarchs had made it their home until now . <p> Alighting from the coach with her mother and Flora , Rebeccastood there in awe of the grand structure that she wouldbe living in for months , possibly years . It was so much biggerthan she had imagined ! Even the marble arch of the ceremonialentrance was stories high ! Palace guards were marching nearbyin their brightly colored uniforms . Other people passed underthe huge arch that Rebecca would be walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly overwhelmedher . She already knew Lilly was n't going to escort her inside , but she was n't ready to say good-bye ! She 'd never had to saygood-bye to her mother before , not like this . <p> Lilly took her hand and squeezed it . She understood . Inthat simple gesture , she gave Rebecca courage . <p> " Your father would have been so proud , had he lived to seethis . " <p> Rebecca glanced at her mother . It was a poignant moment.Lilly was so happy for her daughter , and yet she was no doubtrecalling her own missed opportunities . It was in her expression , close to tears yet smiling . <p> " You two are n't going to cry , are you ? " Flora asked in acomplaining tone . <p> Lilly laughed . Rebecca managed a grin . Flora was good atrelieving tension with her candor . <p> Unfortunately , Flora would n't be living in the palace withRebecca . She would only stay long enough today to get Rebeccasettled in . They both knew that Rebecca was n't going toget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms forall the members of the court , let alone for their servants . SoLilly had rented a flat for Flora nearby so she could come to thepalace each day to maintain Rebecca 's wardrobe and performher usual duties . <p> Lilly had been entertaining the idea of buying a town housein London for Rebecca 's first Season . But now that Rebecca 's " Season " had begun under a completely different set of circumstances , Lilly was more hesitant about the idea . While some ofthe ladies at court owned homes in London where they spenttheir nights instead of sharing a room at the crowded palace , Lilly wanted Rebecca to experience every aspect of court , andthe surest way to do that was to live there . If the Marshalls hada town house , Rebecca might be tempted to go home to it eachnight . <p> Lilly gathered Rebecca into her arms for a long hug . " I 'll seeyou in a few weeks , darling . At least I will try to stay away thatlong . " <p> " You do n't have to  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " This is your time , not mine . You'regoing to enjoy every minute of it . But you must write me everyday . I want to hear about everything . " <p> " I will . " <p> " But most of all , Becky , enjoy yourself . Wonderful thingsare going to happen for you . I just know it . " <p> Rebecca really wished she had more of her mother 's enthusiasm , but her own excitement had waned now that their separationwas imminent . This was her mother 's dream . She wishedLilly could have had it instead of her . <p> But for Lilly 's sake , she put on a bright smile , gave hermother one last hug , and hurried inside the palace . <p> Copyright 2009 by Johanna Lindsey <br> Continues ...
