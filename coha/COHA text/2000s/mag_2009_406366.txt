Your questions answered REFLUX BLUES I have a 10-month-old baby who was just diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . He was put on Apo-Ranitidine and while he 's doing a bit better on the medication , he still wakes up in pain every couple of hours and hates being put down . The only thing that works is nursing him to sleep . How can I help him sleep better - without me ? * GERD is very common in babies and doctors suspect it 's caused by a malfunction of the valve between the stomach and esophagus , which allows food and stomach contents to move back into the esophagus , resulting in spitting up or even vomiting . GERD can cause pain and irritability at any time , especially just after and during feedings . Usually the condition is pretty mild and disappears as the valve gets stronger , sometime before baby 's first birthday . In such cases , no treatment is needed other than trying to keep baby calm and in an upright position after feedings . Doctors also recommend thickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though this is obviously not an option for babies who are only breastfed . If your son is gaining weight and growing normally in every other way ( with no wheezing or pneumonia ) , I think it is time to change medicines . It does n't sound like enough has been done to relieve his pain and that 's resulting in some unfortunate habits . Not only is nursing to sleep bad for his teeth , but it bodes badly for his ability to self-soothe in the future . There are other safe medications for this condition and it sounds as though your son may need something more . - Diane Sacks , paediatrician TROUBLE SWALLOWING My three-year-old has a hard time swallowing food she does n't like . She chews meat and vegetables forever , but she can swallow treats just fine . I may be a softie , but I really do believe she 's unable to swallow these things , as opposed to just not wanting to . Do you have any advice ? * Some kids are extremely sensitive to food tastes and textures . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain fabrics . What are the textures of the " treats " she swallows ? If she chews and swallows a solid cookie or candy , it 's unlikely that she has a physical problem , but if she chokes , vomits , coughs or wheezes when she eats , it might be time for further investigation . An occupational therapist could help you in slowly desensitizing your daughter . You being a " softie " may have led to this behaviour , but it 's definitely not too late to change it . DS DAYDREAMER My five-year-old is constantly daydreaming and often does n't notice when we call her . In sports , she spends a lot of time banished to the sidelines because she does n't listen to her coaches . How can I keep her head out of the clouds - especially when she 's at school ? * Calling out to a child like this is not likely to be effective - you need to be sure you have her attention . To help her learn to listen , make sure you go over to your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have something to say to her . Then have her repeat it so you know she heard you . Make sure she understands that there are consequences for not listening - in sports , it means she does n't get to play ; maybe at home it means she misses out on a snack or an outing . Once she sees a connection between paying attention and getting what she wants , she 'll learn to listen . - Katby Lynn , parent educator TROUBLE TRANSITIONING The school year is almost over , but my six-year-old daughter still seems to be struggling with the transition to all-day school . She cries almost every day and is n't able to cope with small disappointments , like not being first in line . I 'm afraid this will get even worse over the summer and she 'll be starting grade two at a disadvantage . What 's going on ? Can I do anything to help her ? * Grade one is a huge change from kindergarten . Not only is school more demanding academically , there 's more structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what she 's feeling and what 's causing her frustration . To help reassure her , give her a special necklace or bracelet to wear to remind her that you are thinking of her ; it might help her feel more settled and better able to manage disappointments throughout the day . Offer her alternate ways of handling the situation . You can also ask the teacher to help your daughter using similar methods . It 's also a good idea to provide your daughter with opportunities to see her classmates outside of school . This will strengthen her relationships with them and help make school a less daunting place . - Ruwa Sabbagb , psychotherapist SARCASM CONSEQUENCES My 11 - year- old son has a sarcastic sense of humour and often makes snide and insulting comments to his friends . He 's starting to get cut off socially because of his behaviour . We 've tried talking to him about it , asking him how he 'd feel if his friends spoke to him that way , to no avail . How can I teach him empathy and get him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn this manner of speaking ? Often , without our realizing it , our children mimic us . If that 's the case , you might have to curb your own sarcasm for a while . To help him change his style of speaking , first get his permission to help , then when you hear him being sarcastic , offer him another option . You might say : " How else could you say that ? " When he comes home from school , ask him about his day . If he mentions trouble with his friends , walk him through what he said and then teach him a friendlier way to communicate . Be calm and non-judgmental . He 's not trying to offend anyone - he just does n't know what else to say . KL PANIC ATTACKS My 12-year-old son was the target of bullying last year . We found this out when he was badly beaten up one day after class . He 's been to counselling and we 've enrolled him in a new school , but he still suffers from occasional panic attacks because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get over an assault like this ? * It may take several years for your son to overcome this incident , and occasional panic attacks are quite normal after a severe assault like this . As he gets older , he may need occasional counselling to help him keep dealing with the after-effects . You have done all the right things - taking your son to counselling to process this traumatic experience , and changing his school to give him a new start . Hopefully , the counselling was for a long enough period of time and provided him with the opportunity to process what happened to him both physically and psychologically . His self-esteem probably took a beating too , and counselling can empower him and offer ways of coping if he keeps having the panic attacks . It 's important for him to realize that the reason for the bullying was not in himself but in the bully , and it 's going to take time for him to feel safe again . When he has panic attacks in the future , encourage him to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful for you to get some counselling , so you can learn ways to support your son .
