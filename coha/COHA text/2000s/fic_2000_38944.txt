Mary Anning , probably the most important unsung ( or inadequately sung ) collecting force in the history of palaeontology ... made an astounding series of discoveries , including squidlike creatures with associated ink-bags , a plesiosaur in 1824 , and apterosaur ( flyingreptile ) in 1828 . She directly found , or pointed the way to , nearly every specimen of importance . - Finders , Keepers , Stephen Jay Gould , W.W. Norton &; Co. , 1992 . <p> . HAT NAME D'YE GIVE this child ? " There was no love lost between the pastor and Richard Arming , but occasion demanded the baby be handed over . it was accepted with broad , gentle hands . Outwardly , all looked well . " Mary , " said Anning , as though challenging any to deny it . The mutton-chopped head loomed over the infant .

And , in those same " oly names , thought the pastor to himself , I curse thee for thy father 's sake . May Almighty God 's fiery vengeance come down upon " ee and spare ye a long life in this vale of tears . The infant , blessed with knowing nothing , said nothing . It lay uncannily still , looking up at the pastor 's pale face . That gaze grew strangely prolonged . He was glad of the excuse to break it . A fleeting black figure distracted at the chapel door . He looked to see but it was gone . The pastor shook his head , accounting it a mistake , a trick of deceiving light . He had not seen himself , standing in a sea of horrors . It was not possible that he be in two places at once - nor be accompanied by monsters . Elizabeth Haskins shrieked as the rain drove into every crevice . Even at home she disliked thunder , but in an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The equestrian exhibition that was the cause of her presence was given up for lost . Each rider shifted for himself . They hurtled past , a wild mixture of water and noise , making for cover . She knew she must do the same . Her charge was a weakly baby in any case : one chill or cold would finish the job . Elizabeth attached herself to two others she half recognized . They seemed to know a way to escape the deluge ; pointing , shouting each other toward refuge . A tree loomed out of the downpour , a sheltering elm . Any port in a storm . The little group found the tree just as the lightning found it - and them . The electric fork stabbed the Earth but they did not see it . Crisped and black , they left the world behind . Fifteen-month-old Mary survived the hammer blow of Heaven .

There was new wisdom there and he did not care for too much wisdom . ... but the babe alone survived and soon recovered , and from that time ... got better health . The physicians say the shock the Child received must be like that from an electric-fluid machine , thus it may be said that the death of the Nurse was the life of the Child . - Letter from Elizabeth Haskins 's widower , twenty years after the event . She had been a dull child before but after this accident she became lively and intelligent , and grew up so . - Charles Anning , Mary Anning 's nephew , writing in 1847 .

Mary Anning knew that rasp well : it punctuated the psalms and scripture and sermons of every Sunday 's chapel . She wished to avoid it : then and always . The pastor had taken against her , even more than any other of the " noisy sinful children . " She did n't know why and even sought to show repentance - but it did no good . He still glared blackly on her and would cuff her if Richard Anning was not around . Best of all was to avoid him and glide along , invisible , in the shy , sly , slinking byways of life . Even at the age of ten she was good at that . Her bunt for " curios " put into respite , she remained low amidst the clifftop brush and knew he would not see her . For the moment he had eyes for one thing only . Along the new turnpike road the coach and four drew nearer . It looked well laden . The pastor spoke against the " Incomers " most Sundays . He warned against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of all their lascivious appearance when they emerged from the bathing-machines . The yearly growing influx of pleasure seekers to Lyme threatened all piety and peace and might even in time extinguish the native Dorset tongue . The pastor told them to boldly speak their own dialect to the rich and lazy incomers - if speak they must . Mary was sure he was right but there again the grander arrivals were such fun to watch with their funny clothes and speech and manners that it was hard to tear your eyes off them . And if they spoke kindly to you and offered a farthing for directions .... Father sold these " holiday " people the things he made - or else mended what they broke . He could turn his hand to anything in the carpentry line . Then there were the " curios . " On Sundays , when the grander Lymians were in the Anglican church , he set up a table outside his shop beside Cockmoil Prison and the incomers would buy some of his finds chipped out of the cliffs and foreshore beds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach bypassed the pastor in a rumble of hoofs , its breath raising his last rats-tails of hair .

Unaware they were being cursed , Jane Austen and her family and all the other passengers continued down into the fashionable seaside resort of Lyme Regis . We called for a native tradesman , a Mr. Anning-anda Chapel Radical facobin if I ever saw one - to repair to the darling little box-lid but I thought his asking price of five shillings beyond the value of all the furniture in our room altogether . I dismissed the rude beast without further ado . Now I am here I am so longing for balls .... - Jane Austen in correspondence to her sister , Cassandra . 14th September iS04 . " ' I am the way , the truth and the life " The pastor fixed the congregation with a lifetime of experience burning behind his eyes .

He 'd been raised on Cromwell 's " good old cause " and the Levellers demanding the entirety of the Law shoe-horned into one book , understandable to all . Christianity most appealed to him when it was just God made graspable and " do as you would be done by . " The pastor knew their every little foible . They 'd made their way to him in years of confidences and moments of distress . He 'd made it his business to know . A shepherd should understand each sheep 's plaintive baa . Richard Anning he could strip bare with just a look . The man was a radical , a ringleader rioter in hungry years past . He was fired by grievance , not religion , that peasant anger slow burning since the Conquest . He was here because this was not the gentry 's church . The pastor accepted him for his tithe and presence - for he loathed an empty pew - but he knew him . The man spited Scripture with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheld them . A bad influence he was , a millstone to those who heeded him . His children heeded , that was plain : they listened in love . They were being misled to hell . Joseph ( the eldest ) and Mary Anning leaned toward their father : they did not fear . Nothing was as it should be . The pastor disapproved and glared . " ' The way , the truth and the life . " " He said it loud for emphasis and closed the Bible likewise . Sermon ended . The word would find God 's elect and bounce off the damned . It was not his task to distinguish between them but to shovel out promiscuous salvation . All the same , he knew which was which . Richard Anning was tossing an idea back and forth . He relished the exercise : there being need for the lower orders to hone their only weapon in life 's harsh contest . " ... truth and the life ...... Interesting . He resisted the temptation to softness : you had to keep a stone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he informed his offspring as they filed out , " A way that 's hard and treacherous . I 'll show you now . " The pastor knew where they were going and cursed their path . Another , later , Sunday - but much the same . Poverty set an iron pattern on their lives . Sundays - when they were n't selling them - they went curio hunting . The proceeds of the little table meant meat once a week and thus Joseph 's inch or so advantage over his playmates . Sometimes they watched their father traverse the perilous cliff ways , showing them the safest and the best . Other days - as now - they scoured the low-tide beach , a relaxing holiday from risk . " There , " Richard Anning pointed straight up . " Black Ven : the way , the truth and y " death if ye be not mindful .

Climbing her 's good but sweetest be when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her 'll be fuller of curios than a plum pudding is o " currants . But mind ye , old Blackie , she 'll be waiting for ye - the half hanging remnants up above , ready to drop on y " bonce like vengeance . She guards her treasures . Leave her to I jus " yet - promise ? " Mary and Joseph confirmed they 'd never venture that particular cliff unsupervised . " Good . The beach has riches enough for ye just now . Follow I and learn . " The morning bled away , an hour of head-down wandering for every find . " Now , these , " he told Mary - she was the more interested , " these be called " dragon curls . " " The shallow tide water covering the spiraled fossil was brushed aside . " See ? They lift easy and take a shine . Mum can do that . You 'll get a tuppence for they . " A spell of teaching and then they re-split to search . As in everything else , the Annings went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed : only Joseph could be distracted by the scenery . He straightened up to watch the clifftop black cortege wind by . It was the reason they were excused chapel today . Anning would n't have the pastor make a hypocrite of him from beyond the grave . The man 's funeral could thrive well enough without his insincerity . A sudden , sharp-edged gust made the three Annings blink . It raised their hats and coats before dispersing over the sand like disapproval . Richard did n't recall so many twists up Black Ven . According to his reckoning he should be near the top now , yet the path - such as it was ventured on . Gathering dusk - and fright - made him abandon even the pretense of a fossil search . He was cursed today in any case , his hip bag hanging limp , empty of any salable specimen . Home seemed far away and correspondingly attractive . He fingertipped his way round a rocky protrusion . It crumbled under his touch like he 'd become Samson . The tussocks and loose stones underfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... push , to extend his arms and push and fall away , free at last , free from the earth and care , out into the open air . A voice whispered in his head telling him to ... fly - and die . He abused it as not his own - though it sounded like him . Round that corner was another , even sharper , and the path narrowed further still . The bitter bile of panic was definitely washing round his taut mouth now . He 'd never seen or trod this stretch before . Either he 'd taken a wrong way or .... " You did ! " the pastor answered his unspoken question . " You have ! " He stood barring the way , confident beside the yawning abyss . Having already traversed one great divide , Lyme 's cliffs now held no fear . A pocket of frigidity surrounded him . Anning whimpered but could not avoid those dead eyes . He was confronted with all his errors . The pastor remained stock still but his cold advanced . It had fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface by surface , it detached him from the cliff . " Down ye go , " said the pastor by way of blessing , " and fare ye well . " Richard went out into the night and had his few seconds of liberty till Earth came up to embrace him . It was Joseph Anning who found the " crocodile . " Its giant staring head caught his eye at the very edge of the foreshore . But for it being the cusp of the tide he 'd not have been that far out . It was God 's benevolence . The family had been on the parish ever since their father 's death . There 'd be a buyer for a big find : maybe an upcountry big-wig making " science " of it - they paid extra well . Dad had always said look for the " ar-tic-ulated " curios : the more stone bones the more pennies . This one looked promising . If that skinny neck was connected .... It would be a race . The thing was already half an inch deep in sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph got down on his knees and began to scrape . There was more : its coffin bed of stone was nigh flat - not like those frustrating few that directly dived deep below - it went on - and on . Joseph spared a second to look into the empty saucer eyes . " Welcome back to the world , fishy-boy , " he lightly told the two hundred million years " deceased . " Now , pardon I but " t is time for ye to wake . " He raised his father 's chisel . The back of his neck froze . Ice descended on it from on high . He clapped up an involuntary hand . The flesh there was corpse cold . He was going to mark his find anyway , to align it with some shore feature so it could be found again . There was no shame in standing to turn and confront the great fear that had draped itself upon him . It was just possible there might be a madman behind him , sneaking silent up with evil intent . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the cliff . He knew its name and opinion . Joseph turned again . There was enough of his father in him to protest . " T'ai n't none of your business . Not no more . " T is ours . " Then the coldness was coming off the water like an incoming fog . The pastor had moved from clifftop to sea and now stood upon - and against - the tide . Joseph could feel him , could glimpse his floating gaitered feet , but he would not look up . He 'd reached the extent of his defiance . The slab feet stepped forward , propelling Joseph one pace back . The cold and hatred were like awaking in a winter grave . Two more steps , in swift succession , and he had relinquished the fossil . With it - and all it might mean for the family in food and fuel and rent - went the last of his resistance . He somehow knew that the pastor was preparing to tell him things . He could not bear to hear them . He ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after Joseph signed papers to become an upholsterer 's apprentice . It was steady money . He told all to Mary , now a sturdy , plain little eleven-year-old - and told it with a warning . Thereafter , she hunted alone . T TOOK NIGH on a year , but she succeeded . Joseph had given good directions but he 'd not ven ture on the beach again . He had his head buried in the gentry 's sofas . Mary had commanded and cajoled , but his mind was set as hard as the fossil she sought . His experience had put years on him and glass behind his eyes . He 'd sketch her a map but no more . So , there was a year of paddling about on the turn of tide , a year of wet dresses and salt rash and her mother 's reproaches . A twelve-year-old girl 's laboring wages were n't much to lose but they were something . Mary had endured all , stony faced , and God was now pleased to reward her . The sand was scoured off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ever be plainer than today . Her practiced eye discerned its full extent , twenty feet or more from giant head to snaky tail . And were they four flippers splayed out at the sides ? This was something new and wondersome . She paused , focusing on the now harmless rows of teeth . It had once been ravenous , relentless . Those blank eye sockets had looked out upon a cold and-devouring age , somewhen unrecorded in Scripture . It was a monster from a monstrous time now revealed to her in stone . She was teetering over a chasm back into time . The thought froze her . Mary shook off the silliness . First and foremost this thing was money - and salvation from parish charity . Her father 's hammer and chisel came out of his battered curio bag . The sand shifted under her feet - a tiny motion but enough for pause to her attuned senses . She was wary of the tide that curled quiet in behind her , the cliff waiting to fall on her head . They betrayed their murderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the beach . She almost wished it was only the sea come to thwart her . He had been withholding his presence . Released , it chilled to the bone . She clenched her eyes , clenched her bladder . He was standing very close . She 'd always quailed under his gaze even when he was alive . Now it was also indecent just to behold him . The grave had not been kind . His flesh was waxy ; the mutton-chops false looking . That familiar stare came from somewhere far away and awful . " Wicked child , " he hissed . " Desist ! " His breath smelt moss-tinged and decaying . Deep within , some other Mary was crushed and whimpering on the sand , or else a little girl running home . Those possibilities were ignored - scathingly ignored - in favor of the victorious and sinned-against whole , " Why ? " she challenged him - and looked him in the eye . He was not used to that - in life or now . What was left was not up to rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he told her - and pointed at the fossil . " No ! " she answered . " Pennies ! Food ! " The pastor drew in breath he did not need , nostrils and dead eyes flaring alike . There was a flame in them that was not his own . " Thirty pieces of silver ! " Mary did not grasp the reference . Dame and Sunday school had largely washed over her : she 'd been too tired . " Maybe , " she replied in a voice that was hope-touched . " Pounds and pounds maybe ! " He paused . She looked . Could sympathy at last have entered him saved up until the afterlife ? Obviously not . " The faithful dead condemn you , " he said , awhispered fury trembling his big frame . " They rise to condemn you ! " With a gesture he exhumed the beach-buried dead : the shipwrecked sailors , the paupers and murders , the infanticides of all the ages . They rose like levers from their shallow scooped graves and , as one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not eaten breakfast ( there was none ) - and that was as well . She 'd been unaware Lyme beach was so replete with death . They looked at her and she at them . There was horror and weariness and pain- but she did not discern condemnation . Their grievance was not with her but myriad , individual , others . The pastor had raised an unwilling conscript army . Mary stood her ground . His shot had misfired . He realized it and swept the dead back into decent concealment . He seemed at a loss - and desperate enough to reason . " Consider , child , " the kindness failed even to convince himself , " the past you would unleash ...... Suddenly he was surrounded by new monsters ; not the vestigially human ones of a moment before but a flapping , snapping , reptilian host , kith and kin of the " crocodile " at Mary 's feet . They swam about him in the invisible water of another age . They were soulless and devoured each other : constantly : horribly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from , was still repelled . " Do ye prefer this , " he indicated the mindless feeding frenzy all around , " to the reforming beauty of Scripture ? Would ye drag this forgotten Godlessness to today ? " Mary wavered . She had a good heart . She did n't want to be a cause for ill . The point was hammered home with passion . " Would ye be recalled as the Mother of all Doubt ? " All she wanted was freedom from want , for herself and her family . She wanted an end to patched dresses and street taunts . But Mary Anning would n't buy those regardless of cost . The tide was turning ; for the first time she noticed that her boots were inundated . The pastor rode high above both sea and uncertainty . " He is the way , the truth and the life ! No other wisdom is necessary . Mary wavered . The chill of the water joined that of her company , Her hammer and chisel felt like weapons . " Satan 's child : do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as he . She 'd never understood it till today . The little she had been touched by Providence . Then , as she moved to stow her tools , there came that touch again . Lightning had struck twice : a second bolt : another blinding flash - this time purely internal : just as searing but entirely benign . " The way , the truth and the life , " an inner voice told her . it was both hers - and another 's . It was God-like : all-consuming . The backwash touched the pastor also . He understood - and understood all too well . His face was twisted with disappointment . He wept . For the first time Mary pitied him . " Betrayed ! " he howled . " Betrayed ! his last words . Then he - and his fears and visions - were snuffed out . He was taken away to learn in love . Mary Arming shook her head . She too understood - and understood the truth . She 'd been told that truth was best and - with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleven-year-old Mary Anning took up her tools and began to dig . POSTSCRIPT ... It is certainly a wonderful instance of divine favour - that this poor , ignorant girl should be so blessed , for by reading and application she has arrived to that degree of knowledge as to be in the habit of writing and talking with professors and other clever men on the subject , and they all acknowledge that she understands more of the science than anyone else in the kingdom . - Lady Silvester. 17th September 1824 . Henry Henley , Lord of Lyme Manor , paid Mary 123 - a year 's income to the Annings - for her Ichthyosaur when it was eventually raised , intact , from the Dorset Lias .
