Last month it was a unicorn . This month , Billy has an encounter with spacemen that might call Agnes Moorehead to mind for some readers . What lies ahead for young Billy ? Only time will tell . <p> " LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN THE driveway , " said Billy 's father . He held up a little rocket ship . " I almost ran over it . Does it belong to anyone here ? " " No , sir , " said Billy . " We have a problem then , " said Billy 's father . " It must be a spaceship from another planet . " " Is there anyone inside ? " asked Billy 's mother . She was carving the turkey . They had turkey every night . Billy 's father held the little rocket ship up to his ear and shook it . " No , " he said . " That means they must be hiding here in the house somewhere . " " May I be excused ? " asked Billy . " Not until you eat your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room and opened his drawer . It was filled with little spacemen . They had landed in the driveway the night before . They had climbed in the window and hidden in his drawer . Billy had pretended to be asleep but he had watched the whole thing from under the covers . " Who are you ? " asked the spacemen when Billy opened the drawer . Billy told them . " What planet are you from ? " he asked . " Would n't you like to know , " they said . They were wearing space helmets . " Is this Earth ? " " Yes , " said Billy . " You can take off your space helmets . There 's plenty of air here . It 's not like the Moon . " Billy had learned about the Moon at school . There is no air on the Moon . " Your air stinks , " said the spacemen . " It does not , " said Billy . " It does so , " said the spacemen . They put their helmets back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they said . " We are going to kill everybody and then it will smell better . " " You are too little , " said Billy . " That 's why we need your help , " said the spacemen . " I 'm just a little boy , " said Billy . The next morning the spacemen were still in the drawer . " Look what we found , " they said . " That 's just a pencil , " said Billy . " It is not , it 's a spear , " said the spacemen . " Sharpen it for us . " Billy stuck the pencil in his electric pencil sharpener . A little light came on when the pencil was sharp . He gave it back to the spacemen . " I think you should go home , " he said . " You can keep the pencil . " " It 's a spear , " said the spacemen . " And we do n't care what you think . Take us to your leader . We will kill him and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , " said Billy . " That 's even better , " said the spacemen . " We can hide in your lunchbox . " " What if I say no ? " said Billy . " Then we 'll kill you too , " said the spacemen . Billy took the spacemen to school . They were hiding in his lunchbox . It had a rocket ship on it . " That 's a stupid lunchbox , " said the teacher . " That rocket does n't look real . " " It does so , " said Billy . It was embossed . " And it 's full of spacemen . They intend to conquer Earth . " " That I want to see , " said the teacher . " It 's your funeral , " said Billy . He opened his lunchbox . The spacemen jumped out and killed the teacher . All the kids screamed . Pretty soon the police came . They took Billy home . " The teacher killed himself with a pencil , " said the police . " All the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , " said Billy 's mother . " It was his own fault , " said Billy . Billy went to his room . He dumped the spacemen out of his lunchbox into his drawer . " You almost got me in trouble , " he said . " That was my teacher you killed . " " That was just for practice , " said the spacemen . " Now take us to your leader so we can kill him and take his keys . " " What if I say no ? " " Then we 'll kill you too , " said the spacemen . " But if you help us conquer Earth , we 'll make you King . " " Hmmmm , " said Billy . " Let me think about it . " Billy was only pretending to think about it . He did n't want to be King . He was just a little boy . But he was afraid of the spacemen . What if they killed him ? He decided to fool them . " Okay , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the toilet seat . " What 's this ? " they asked . " It 's round . " " The White House , " said Billy . " It 's supposed to be round . " He picked up a toothbrush and hid it behind his back . " Where is your leader ? " asked the spacemen . " Down there , " said Billy . " Look . " The spacemen leaned over the edge and looked down . Billy knocked them into the water with the toothbrush . Their helmets made them float . Billy flushed the toilet and they disappeared . Then he flushed it again just to be sure . " Get a load of this , " said Billy 's father . He was reading the paper . " Spacemen Suspected in Teacher Death . " " What spacemen ? " said Billy 's mother . " I never heard anything about any spacemen . " " They were little , " said Billy . " But they were mean . " He told his parents how he had fooled the spacemen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill us all and conquer Earth , " he said . " That was a close call , " said Billy 's father . " I guess we can get rid of this little rocket now . " He took out his hammer and broke it . Then he passed the turkey . " You could have been King , " said Billy 's mother . " Instead you are a hero . " " No , " said Billy proudly . " I 'm just a little boy . " <p>
