SOMETIMES THE ONLY warning is a flash of sun on the lens of a sniper 's scope . Today I 'm lucky enough to catch the mistake . <p> Funny , I think as I duck down behind the nearest parked car , I do n't feel lucky . <p> The car is a tiny thing , an ultra enviro-friendly Honda Righteous painted an unambiguous green . Good for the planet , bad for cover . Ahead there 's an H5 so massive and red I first take it for a fire truck . The selfish bastard parked illegally , blocking an alley , and for that I 'm grateful . <p> I take a quick look at the roof of the building across the street before starting my dash to the Hummer . Halfway there a woman in plastic devil horns steps into my attempt to dodge her and her clipboard . <p> " **93;3054;TOOLONG ? " Damn , she 's good . She sounds like she trained with a preBay auctioneer . <p> I feint left and dart right , putting her between me and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't follow . It 's not the first lie I 've told today , and it 's not likely to be the last . <p> Temporarily safe behind the Hummer , I lean against the heavily tinted windows of the far back seat door , glad to be standing upright but panting and sweating and wishing I was n't wearing the black jumpsuit I reserve for funerals and job interviews . Nanofiber , my ass - it ca n't even keep up with a little physical activity on a hot April day . <p> I start the long walk toward the front bumper , figuring I 'll duck into the alley and continue on my way one block over . It seems like a good plan until another Shooter steps out of the alley . <p> This one has a pistol . I 'd go cross-eyed if I tried to look down the barrel . <p> " Oh , come on , " I say , backing away slowly . " Not the face . " <p> He dips the barrel down a bit . I sigh and start pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same direction . I stop just shy of revealing cleavage - I 'll get shot in the face before I give this punk an eyeful . <p> He shrugs and fires . <p> " You little bastard ! " I yell at his retreating back as I pull the dart out of my forehead . " I want your license number ! " <p> Of course he does n't bother to stop . They never do . <p> The itching starts almost immediately , and I reflexively reach up and touch the bump above my eyes . I know better than to scratch it , but I do anyway . The scratching releases a flood of chemicals that creates a powerful and specific food craving . I brace myself . <p> French fries . French fries from the den of the evil clown , where they do n't even pretend to use potatoes anymore . I hate those French fries , so golden and crispy on the outside , so moist and fluffy on the inside - No no no no no , I do not want them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casts on my route with relative calm , but by the second the itching is more intense and all I can imagine are French fries . Disgusting , nasty , tasty , delicious French fries . <p> This is not the way to walk into a job interview . <p> The site of my two o'clock appointment looms in the office tower ahead ... right behind a third opportunity to relieve the craving . I keep moving , trying not to think about how well the diabetes-inducing corn syrupy sweet ketchup complements the blood pressure-raising salty savor of the fries . <p> I make a full circuit through the revolving doors of the office building before going back toward the object of my involuntary , chemically enhanced desire . <p> The food odors pounce immediately and I can almost feel the molecules sticking to my clothes . Even if I turn around now I 'll smell like fast food . <p> " Let 's get this over with , " I say unnecessarily to the credit scanner , staring it down until it greenlights my ability to pay for food I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain fries , which is unusual , so I punch hard at a picture of French fries on the order panel . The dents in the panel tell me I 'm not the only customer who feels antagonistic about buying food here . <p> It should n't take more than a minute or two for the fries to appear in a compartment , so when they do n't I start pounding on the automat . <p> " Hey , hurry it up ! " I yell , scratching furiously at the bump on my forehead . <p> The back door of the empty fry compartment slides open . An eye stares out at me . <p> " What ? " <p> " Fries . I need fries . " <p> " We 're out of fries , " the voice behind the automat says . <p> " How can you be out of fries ? You 've got Shooters out there making people crave the damned things ! " <p> " That 's why we 're out . " <p> " Does n't the head office coordinate this stuff ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's 1:47 , enough time to go back to the second place if I hurry . But I do n't hurry . I pace in the street , muttering to myself like a lunatic . It 's almost five minutes before I quit trying to control the craving and dash back the way I came . <p> I give the next credit scanner an especially dirty look , then yank open the one compartment with fries . I stop only to pump blobs of ketchup from the dispenser . On my way out I pass an old man scratching his arm as he raves through an open compartment , " How can you be out of fish sandwiches ? ! " <p> " Try the one on Third and Pine , " I say around a mouthful of fries . <p> CraveTech 's offices are both plush and haphazard , the combined result of a record-breaking IPO and the latest design fad : early dot-corn retro . I arrive sweaty , greasy , nauseated , and thoroughly pissed off . I smile at the receptionist anyway , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a desk made out of two sawhorses topped with an old door and a crystal vase . <p> " Alex Monroe . I have a two o'clock with Mr. Avery . " <p> " Two o'clock ? " he says pointedly . It 's 2:02 . " Have a seat . Something to drink while you 're waiting ? " <p> " Water please . " I 'll probably retain every ounce . Damn salty French fries . There are pills that reduce bloating , of course - they sell them out of the same automat - but I would n't hand over any more of my money . <p> I 've just taken my first sip when a young man pops out of the office . He looks like a typical startup manager : handsome , well-dressed , and almost certainly in over his head . <p> " Ms. Monroe , welcome ! " He bounds up to me , hand extended . During the handshake he nods toward my forehead . " Ah , I see you use our products ! " He laughs heartily at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's a wonderful time to be in chemical advertising , Ms. Monroe , " he says , shepherding me into his office . I notice he has a proper desk . " We have some exciting deals in the works . Exciting , exciting deals . " <p> " Really ? " I say , distracted by the fry-lump in my stomach . <p> " Oh , yes . Now that the Supreme Court has reversed most of those class action suits , Shooters do n't have to be stealthy . We 've had to discontinue the tobacco lines for the time being , but otherwise it 's open season on consumers . " <p> I make another effort to join in his laughter , and , reaching toward the bump on my head , add , " It certainly is effective . " <p> " Indeed . " He smiles like he loaded the dart himself . " So , " he says , picking up my resume , " I see your background is in print . " <p> " Yes , but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interested in chemical advertising 's potential . " <p> " Well , it is a growing field , plenty of room for trailblazers , especially with campaigns as impressive as these . " He sets my resume aside . " And of course we still have quite a lot of synergy with print . " He pulls an inchlong Crave dart out of a drawer and drops it on the desk between us . I resist the urge to cringe at the sight of the wretched thing . <p> " What do you see ? " he asks . <p> I want to say a menace , but instead I tap the delivery barrel and give the context-appropriate answer . " Unused ad space . " <p> Suddenly he 's a schoolmaster who has finally found a bright pupil in a classroom full of dunces . <p> " Exactly , Ms. Monroe . Exactly . No square millimeter wasted , that 's what I say . " He leans across the table and whispers conspiratorially , " We 're looking at co-branding an **25;3177;TOOLONG Lattepalooza Crave with a Forever Fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . Coupons on the darts . How does that grab you ? " <p> " Coupons . " <p> " Tiny coupons , like the ones on swizzle sticks . Ca n't you just see it ? You get Stuck , so you want the product , but you 're also concerned about your weight . The coupon helps . The coupon tells you the provider cares about your concerns . It tells you they understand . " He leans back in his chair , my cue to speak . <p> " Interesting . But I 'd go log-in rebate rather than immediate discount . Same message , same coverage , easier on the bottom line . " <p> He leans forward again . " I like the way you think , Ms. Monroe . " <p> I hate meeting at Sandra 's house - her cats are constantly trying to climb up on my lap , I suspect because they know I 'm allergic to them . But Sandra is my best friend from college , and also my cell leader , so I usually end up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the forehead , " she says when she opens the door . <p> " Yeah , and that 's an ugly one on your neck . " <p> " That 's a hickey . " <p> " Oh , uh , sorry . Or congratulations , I guess . " <p> " Eh , " she shrugs , heading to the kitchen . <p> I follow . " Um , are n't you a little old to be getting those ? " <p> " Maybe , but Liam 's not too old to be giving them . " Sandra has a taste for idealistic young revolutionaries . <p> She starts to make herbal tea , and I know enough not to ask for coffee instead . <p> We take the tea to the lumpy , cat-hair covered futon in the living room . " How 'd the interview go ? " <p> " Shaky start . Getting Stuck really threw me off . But I did manage to laugh at his jokes , and , sad to say , I 'm more or less qualified . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind me that I 've only recently stopped being part of the problem . " So where do things stand ? " she asks . <p> " He said he only had one more interview , and he 'd call to let me know by the end of the week . " <p> " Did you pick up anything while you were there ? " <p> " Not much about the next formulas . **25;3204;TOOLONG is definitely in now , but that 's old news . " <p> " But you think you can get access ? The job 's in the right division ? " <p> " Close enough . Marketing 's always looking over R &.D's; shoulder . It wo n't seem strange for me to be poking around . " <p> " What should I tell our counter-formula development contact ? " <p> " Well , assuming I get the job , and assuming I can start right away , three weeks . Maybe four . It 'll depend on their security . " <p> She seems satisfied with this answer . " What about Plan B ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil genius ? " <p> " He 's not evil - he 's just oblivious . " <p> She raises an eyebrow at this . " Dangerously oblivious . " <p> " Yes , I know . " I concentrate on picking cat hair off my clothes . " It 's going fine . Fourth date tonight . Expensive place . I should get going , actually . " I rise and head for the door . She stops me and stares pointedly at my forehead . <p> " Alex , do n't forget - he 's the enemy . " <p> I consciously abort an eye-roll and substitute a smile . " Dangerously oblivious genius equals enemy . Check . " I give her a little wave as I step outside . <p> " Which restaurant are you going to ? " Sandra asks from the doorway . <p> " Prima . " <p> Her brow furrows . " Do n't they serve real meat ? " <p> " Oh yes - and I 'll be ordering a steak , " I say , taking a moment to enjoy her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rare , please . " <p> " Make that two , " Tom says . " Mine medium . " <p> " Very good , " the server says . " I 'll be back with the first course shortly . " He gives us each a prim little four-star nod as he leaves . <p> I put my elbows on the white linen tablecloth and rest my chin on my interlaced fingers . " I 'm not sure I can ever love a man who would ruin a perfectly good steak . " <p> Tom leans into the candlelight , too . " And I 'm not sure I can trust a woman who likes her meat nearly raw . " <p> " I guess we 'll just have to stay together for the sex . " <p> " And the children . " He raises his glass to his lips . <p> " I 'm not having sex with children , you pervert . " <p> He chokes on his wine and grabs his napkin . I have to give him points for not looking around to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd known you 'd be shooting wine out of your nose I 'd have suggested a Merlot , " I say as innocently as I can manage . <p> " How , " he coughs , " did I ever end up in such hazardous company ? " <p> WE MET accidentally at a Better Living Through Chemistry Expo sponsored by **39;3231;TOOLONG six weeks ago . <p> Actually , we met at a hotel bar during the expo . <p> I was running my report through my head , thinking about the companies that had the most bad news for humanity in the works . He sat down a couple of barstools away . We traded a little eye contact and a few shy smiles in the dim light . <p> " So which of these evil bastards are you representing ? " <p> He laughed . " CraveTech . " <p> " Ooh , a startup . Exciting . " <p> " Yeah . What about you ? " <p> " Me ? I 'm with an underground group whose goal is to liberate people from the tyranny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you said ? " <p> " Yeah , we 're not very good at that part . " I was already starting to like his laugh , especially since it came so easily . " Actually , I freelance in marketing . " <p> " Anything I might have seen ? " <p> " Maybe the Junior Chemical Engineer campaign . " <p> " ' Big Molecules for Little Hands . ' " <p> " That 's the one , " I said , suddenly aware I was twisting a lock of my hair around my finger . I reached for my drink . <p> " Was n't there a massive judgment against them in one of the last big class action suits ? " <p> " No , that was Union-Pfizer 's My First Exothermic Reaction . Ours were just repackaged Make Your Own Cologne ! kits left over from the last Queer Eye reunion tour . " <p> " Clever . " He got up and closed the barstool gap between us . <p> " Despicable . So what do you do at CraveTech ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , " I said , laughing until he slid the nearest candle closer . I squinted at a face I almost recognized from the cover of Time-Newsweek . <p> " Where are your glasses ? " <p> " Contacts tonight . " <p> " You lose the glasses when you do n't want to be recognized . " <p> " Yeah , sort of a - " <p> " Reverse Clark Kent thing . " <p> He smiled . " Yeah , " and I could feel his geeky little heart reaching out for mine . <p> Tonight he 's wearing his glasses . He looks cute in them . <p> " Of course , the really exciting work is in BeMod , " he says , slicing into his steak . <p> " BeMod ? " This seems like a good time to play dumb . <p> " Behavior Modification . The current dart formulas can make you want to ingest something - food , smoke , whatever . That 's easy . " <p> " Easy for you , " I say , raising my eyebrows toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least he has the grace to look embarrassed . " Yeah , uh , sorry about that . But once we ship the darts to the providers , it 's pretty much out of CraveTech 's hands . I get Stuck sometimes , too , you know . " <p> I spell the word oblivious in my head over and over , until I lose the urge to punch him . It takes four this time , so I miss hearing yet another version of the " If It Was n't CraveTech It Would Be Someone Else " speech . <p> " ... anyway , it 's all just using the chemistry of cravings , " he 's saying when I 'm calm enough to tune hack in . " The fact that you have to buy whatever it is you 're craving is an indirect consequence . " <p> " An awfully profitable indirect consequence . " I stab at a carrot . <p> " Yes , but see , that 's the thing : the next big leap in the field is to skip straight to the buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to brain chemistry when avid consumers watch successful commercials . " <p> " So you 're trying to synthesize a drug that will make people go out and buy Max White toothpaste . " <p> " Or a pair of NeoNikes . Or an H5 . " <p> " Oh my God . " <p> He unleashes his Boy Genius grin . " Yeah . Pretty cool , huh ? " <p> I report for my first day at CraveTech two weeks later . No one mentions that I 'm dating the CEO , so I assume it has n't gotten out . Still , I make a point of flirting back - and being overheard - when the cute young thing from Amazon-FedEx-Kinko 's makes her rounds . <p> I 'd told Tom up front that I was applying for the job . He was encouraging , but made it clear he would keep his nose out of it and leave things to Avery . I never see Tom around the marketing department - he seems more interested in making things than selling them , which I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . <p> I flop down on Sandra 's futon , narrowly missing a cat . <p> She puts mugs of tea on the table while I fish an envelope out of my shoulder bag . When she sits down next to me I place the envelope in her hands . <p> " Information , " I say , " and lots of it . " She takes the data card out of the envelope and peers at it as if she can actually make sense of what it contains . <p> " This is all of them ? " <p> " All the formulas set to come out over the next six months . I 've included a release schedule so you 'll know which ones will be hitting the street first . " <p> " The counter-formula team is gon na love this . " <p> " They 'd better . That little card represents a month of my life spent smiling at banalities and pretending to care about other people 's kids . " <p> " So you 're ready to quit . " She sounds relieved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I can just yet . I still have n't found anything about this BeMod stuff . Tom keeps going on about it , but as far as I can tell it has n't surfaced in R &D."; <p> " Is n't it weird that he seems so serious about BeMod but you ca n't find it at CraveTech ? " <p> I laugh . " So you think he has some other lab where he 's developing chemicals he can use to rule the world ? " <p> " Maybe not rule the world ... just make a shitload of money , which is close enough . " <p> " You 're serious , are n't you ? " <p> She shifts uncomfortably on the futon . " It just seems like he 's been awfully specific about this BeMod stuff , and it has n't turned up where you 'd expect it . " <p> " So what are you suggesting ? " <p> " I think it 's time you broke up with him , and maybe quit CraveTech , too . " <p> " But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get our hands on it and start on a counter-formula as soon as we can . " <p> " That 's true . " <p> " And how do we do that if I do n't keep seeing him ? " <p> The cell leader finally overcomes the college buddy . " Just be careful . Do n't get too attached to him . " <p> I pick up the data card , two gig worth of corporate espionage . " Does this seem like I 'm too attached ? " <p> I arrive at Tom 's place in a foul mood . He does n't notice . Dangerously oblivious . <p> We 're still in the foyer when he starts in about BeMod . <p> " I read a fascinating study on endorphins today . Apparently you can stimulate - " <p> " Can we please talk about something other than biochemistry ? " I drop my bag on the floor . <p> He looks surprised and a little hurt . " I 'm sorry , I did n't realize I was boring you . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand as we head into the living room . " I just think we have more in common than an interest in BeMods and DC Comics . " I have n't gotten around to telling him I prefer Marvel . <p> He stops and pulls me back toward him . " I love you . " <p> " See , there you go - I love me , too . Something else we have in common . " <p> " Oh for God 's sake , " he sighs , collapsing on his down-filled couch . " I 'm trying to be serious . " <p> " I know . " I sit down next to him . " I 'm sorry . I just need a little more time . " <p> " Okay . A little more time , " he says , kissing my forehead and then my neck . <p> It 's so easy to kiss him back . <p> The next time I go to Sandra 's , she has a data card for me . <p> " What 's this ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all darts because internal studies have shown them to trigger heart attacks and strokes in a small but substantial segment of the population . We need you to send it out from the CraveTech network . " <p> I hand the card back to her . " The media will figure out it 's bogus . " <p> " Not before the stock plummets . We 're set up to trigger a small drop , and the release will do the rest . " <p> " You know I wo n't be able to go back there after I send it . They 'll trace it to me . " <p> " I know . " I stare hard at her . She does n't flinch . <p> " And I 'll have to break up with Tom . " <p> " You need to do that anyway , Alex . It 's been almost six months . That 's too long . It 's longer than you 've dated anyone for real . " <p> " Sandra , sending this press release is just throwing a brick through a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll replace the window . The stock price will readjust . " <p> " But it will slow them down . " <p> " Sandra , if it is n't CraveTech , it 'll be .... " <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing . " I take the card . <p> " You 'll send the release ? " <p> " I 'll send it . " <p> I put the few personal items that decorated my cubicle in a gym bag . I never had a picture of Tom on my desk . That would have been indiscreet . <p> The press release glows on my work station , one twitch away from every major news outlet and the most incendiary of the minor ones . If I had a picture of Tom , I might have stared at it for a while , maybe even whispered Sorry to it . <p> But I do n't , so I just flick Send . <p> I 'VE COME TO BREAK UP with him . " You 're early , " he says when he greets me at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow him out to the deck . <p> " For what ? " <p> " Our six-month anniversary . " There 's a cloth-covered table and dining chairs , a silver champagne bucket on a stand . " In another twenty minutes there 'll be a sunset , too . " He says this like he paid for it . " But , you know , " he looks oddly apologetic , " you 're early . " <p> " Tom , I 'm sorry ... we 're not going to have a six-month anniversary . " <p> I expect anything from him but the crooked Boy Genius smile I love so much . " This is n't about the press release , is it ? " <p> I sit , a little inelegantly in my surprise . <p> " What press release ? " <p> He laughs . " This conversation will probably be less awkward if I just tell you I had all your CraveTech e-mails routed to me before they went out . " <p> Ah . <p> " I was a little surprised that you actually sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs . I love you for them - I want you to know that . " He pours us each a glass of champagne . " And besides , you really helped me out with those counter-formulas . " <p> I pick up my glass then set it down again . " Helped you out ? " <p> " Absolutely . My people made a couple of tweaks , though . Your group 's design was n't very cost effective at the ten thousand unit level . " <p> " Wait , wait , wait . You 're going to manufacture our counter-formulas ? " <p> " Oh , yes . The marketing campaign has been in development at a subsidiary company for weeks now . And the profit projections - Alex , you would n't believe it . Apparently people really , really hate the craving darts . " Oh , my oblivious darling . " They 'll pay twice the cost of the actual food just to make the cravings go away . <p> " But they wo n't have to . We 'll be giving away the counter-formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research shows people would rather pay a couple of bucks to get the antidote from a familiar , trusted source than from a pack of anarchists with a habit of blowing up buses . " <p> " Blowing up buses ? What 're you - " <p> " Oh , it 's a little something we 're planning for the fourth quarter . Disinformation campaign . It 's ready for implementation now , but we think everyone will be more inclined to actively hate you during the holidays . " <p> " Hate me ? " I stand up and start backing toward the door . <p> " Well , not you , your group . They 'll love you , Alex . You 'll be managing my charitable organizations , giving away money to worthy causes right and left . People love that . And they 'll love me . People love CEOs whose wives do that kind of stuff . " <p> " Wives ? " He brings out a pistol and fires a dart into my neck . I pull out the dart and drop it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He answers my question with a question as he pops open a little black velvet box . <p> " Alex , will you marry me ? " <p> " Tom , you sneaky little - " I say , lost between admiration and horror . " Will I marry you ? " <p> Of course I will . <p> Tom Jr . has a hard time waking up in the morning . He gets it from me , not his father , who is always up before the crack of dawn , especially since the BeMod wide dispersal aerosol went into production . <p> " Tommy , wake up ! " I call out toward his room . There 's only a muffled grumbling in response . <p> I walk up to his doorway . " Really , Tommy , it 's time to get going . You 'll be late for school . " <p> He rolls over , groaning , but does n't make a move to get up .
