ANGELS OF EDEN // Trinidad // * * * // " Welcome to Matura , " the night-darkened sign had said , " Home of the Leatherback Turtles . " From the sleeping village on Trinidad 's northeast coast we drive a jungle-curtained dirt road sparked by fireflies . Scott Eckert , his face framed by a short , graying beard , grips the steering wheel as we bounce along the ruts and roots of a place he loves . Rain-forest trees silhouetted by a half-moon line the sky . Above , a see-through veil of cloud is scudding across the lunar wedge . Where forest yields abruptly to palms dancing in the warm breeze , surf rumble overtakes the trilling jungle . // Rounding a turn and arriving finally at the beyond of nowhere , I 'm surprised to see school buses parked around an open-sided rain shelter . If we 've left the world behind , so have about 150 other people-many teens and children among them-hoping also to see a giant nesting sea turtle . // Coming immediately to greet Scott is a slender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group Nature Seekers , which organizes these outings . Youngest of tonight 's Nature Seekers is eight-year-old Chantel , whose braids emerge from under a red baseball cap . She 's with her grandmother Savita . On the dark beach the mist in my light beam comes thick with the sea 's scent . A stiff breeze is blowing . // When Christopher Columbus got here he thought he had found the portal to Eden . He 'd dedicated his third voyage to the Holy Trinity , and when he sighted a large island with three peaks Trinidad-it seemed surely a sign . Columbus wrote , " God made me the messenger of the new heaven and the new earth ... and he showed me where to find it . " In the Gulf of Paria he found the sea freshening . An overwhelming sense of miracle must have attended an island bearing such obvious signs of heavenly guidance and a sea turned to freshwater . Columbus apparently believed Earth was " shaped like a woman 's breast , " with the Garden of Eden where the nipple might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew had never seen a river the size of the Orinoco , and its ocean-diluting flow convinced Columbus that the Garden of Eden lay near at hand . Columbus named the large landmass Tierra de Gracia-Grace Land . We call it South America . Columbus thought this realm was God 's paradise on earth . // Above an ocean black but for the foaming surf , distant lightning flashes . Four people are patrolling somewhere on this miles-long beach for nesting giant Leatherback Turtles . // Last night , no turtles appeared . High wind and high surf discourage turtles from approaching shore . Leatherbacks are heavy enough to come down hard , so they tend to stay away when the surf is cracking wild . Tonight 's surf remains rather heavy , with a rolling roar and foamy breakers . Most Leatherbacks arrive here before two A.M. It 's already midnight , and no turtles . // Scott optimistically incants , " Any minute now . " // Rain begins . I pull up my rain-jacket hood and turn my back to the wind . Heavy rain also keeps turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brackish water flowing from the rivers . Abiraj says , " Normally , the beginning of turtle season is the dry season . Usually the beaches are very wide then . But this year it 's been raining the whole time , very bad erosion . I 've never seen weather this strange . " // The beach is squeezed between a restless sea and the coconut palms and dense jungle . Where high-reaching surf pins us against the vegetation , we time the wave 's retreat and then run before the next wave . One of these breakers could knock a person down . Rough and dark as the surf is , we proceed carefully . // A volunteer patroller greets us with news of an arriving female , far down the beach . // Her tractorlike track leads from the surf up to dry sand and shadows , revealing her whereabouts . The sight of her is sufficiently astonishing to strike a deep gasp into my ribs . The word turtle is vastly inadequate for this dark monster , breathing before me like a sudden remembrance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreal , counterfeit , yet so imposing as to banish all doubt of the fact of her . Most of her shell is dusted with sand , making her look sugar-coated , an eight-hundred-pound confection , long as a man and thigh-high . Lying like a just-crashed saucer from the other side of darkness , with those huge splayed flippers , she seems wondrous as a fallen angel . She seems impossible . // Lured and shipwrecked by the hazards of maternal devotion , she lies quietly marooned . From the exertion suggested by her groundbreaking tracks , from the weight and gravity of her-and merely that she has paused , exhausted , atop the incline of the beach-her arrival seems an act of defiance , a tribute to everything that rises and persists against all reason . // Soon , her stillness stirs . She begins the odds-defying task she was born to perform . She brings her front flippers up and forward like the wings they are to her , twists them like propellers , and chops down vertically , straight into the sand . Now her wings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flings a shower of beach behind her . Thus she begins her " body pit " ; this is how she clears the site and settles down , embedding herself into deeper , moister sand . // Each female encounters a different set of challenges every time she hits the beach . She may come in where the beach is too steep ; she may come on the wrong tide ; she may arrive where the beach is too narrow ; she may ascend to find a wrack line obstructed with drift logs and trash-or a man with a machete. // I 'm grateful for the moonlight . She 's a surprisingly leather-bound beast : no scales , not on flippers , head , even shell . There is n't that turtle-hardness . Her wide , winglike foreflippers , each three-quarters her body length , span fully eight feet or so . Very different are her rear flippers : palmate like hands , for sculling and ruddering . A bridge of soft skin conjoins her rear flippers and her short tail like one integrated assembly . Notwithstanding its long meridian ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . The rear of her " shell " attenuates to a narrow , projecting point , serrated like the blade of an aloe plant . Her head and neck are massive , the size of a soccer ball . // Getting down onto my belly in the sand , my chin resting on clasped fingers , I am low and dark , still as a beach log . A few feet away and toward her rear , I do n't seem to be disturbing her at all . // She deepens the pit by flinging sand with powerful strokes of her oar-like foreflippers-showering me-then clearing and pushing additional sand with her rear flippers . Her shoulders flex as she pivots closer and the ridged leather-bound shell pauses very near me . She stops and blinks away thick , gelatinous tears . She inhales , then continues chopping farther into the beach and flinging back more sand . // In the water she was weightless and buoyant . Here she suddenly weighs nearly half a ton . Her exertions reflect unaccustomed inner pressures . Every few minutes she rests for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while drawing in a bucketful of atmosphere . Two strong , hard structures protrude from her upper jaw like large canine teeth , while the point of her lower jaw rises in one sharp , upward-projecting fanglike point that fits between the two " canines . " Her entire shell rises as she breathes , her rear legs lifting her body like a bellows so air can enter . Each inhalation is a sharp gasp , each exhalation a deep gurgling hushing gush of air . // When her body pit is deep enough to settle her into moister sand , she stops using her foreflippers and rests . // Now , with her rear flippers flattened to surprisingly wide spades , she throws sand until she has a foot-deep hole directly under her tail . Her motion changing again , she next begins carefully lifting palmfuls of sand from the deepening chamber , depositing them gingerly alongside her . She 's doing this with her rear flippers , cupping them like hands in mittens , her work unseen and flawless , the work of a blind watchmaker . Quite unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the manipulations of her rear flippers are dexterous beyond imagining . They have the exquisite sensitivity of an elephant 's trunk . // I wriggle in closer . She alternates-one scoop of sand with the right rear flipper , then one flipperful with her left-pivoting her body slightly with each alternation so she can deftly maneuver each flipper into the hole . She 's creating a perfectly cylindrical chamber , surprisingly deep , remarkably round . Strikingly , each time she reaches in , her flipper enters the hole with perfect delicacy , never knocking sand from the edge or sides . Nothing in human experience is so skilled while so unlearned. // Two Nature Seekers arrive . We exchange quiet greetings . They radio that a group can be sent to see this turtle ( " She done body pittin ' ; she ready to lay de eggs now . Ovah " ) and continue along down the beach . // Now the hole is about the depth of one whole rear flipper . She again changes technique : reaching in , lifting a cupped flipperful of sand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap . It 's a tricky motion and an improbable maneuver. // She 's alternating movement and deep gasps of air , her breathing so labored it 's audible above the surf 's thunder . She steadily digs this cylinder for half an hour-reaching , pulling , flinging , alternating , reaching , pulling-and now she 's slowing , resting more , taking deeper breaths . // I hear voices and turn to see people who 've found her track from the sea , moving toward us in the dark . // Now with one flipper she is touching , gently and sensitively , the chamber 's interior . With her flipper tips she widens the bottom into a flared flask . Methodically , meticulously , delicately , she curls the fingers of her mitten , shaving one side of the chamber 's base with the tip of one flipper , then using the other , flaring the flask that will receive her eggs . Finally one rear flipper is just dangling , waving in the hole , unable to reach more sand . The chamber is fully as deep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely varying ages arrive , all Trinidadian , led by eight-year-old Chantel and her grandmother Savita . They come amid whispers of astonishment . Chantel sits silently in the sand next to me . Grandma Savita quietly directs the whole crowd behind us , to reduce visual distraction for the giant turtle . Many sit . Scott and Abiraj stand well off to the side . // When all have settled , a boy perhaps seven years old asks , " What is that ? " // Grandma Savita replies , " That is the turtle . " // The perplexed child reassesses the giant before him and responds , " That 's a turtle ? " // Carefully Savita directs her small , dim flashlight to the turtle 's posterior . The whole crowd leans forward , their attention directed to the egg chamber . // The people have come with school or church groups from distant villages . Many are repeat visitors . They belie the stereotype that locals in developing countries lack interest in nature . // After a pause of perhaps two minutes come those long-anticipated first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give others a good glimpse of the eggs filling the chamber . When , in her next exertion , three eggs fall from her into the chamber , it draws gasps from the crowd . // I wonder about our disturbance . But this crowd is the turtle 's best insurance against anyone coming to kill it . In the world as it is , this intrusive , admiring crowd is the price a turtle pays for living . Before Nature Seekers was formed in 1990 , poachers killed roughly half the turtles coming to lay eggs in Trinidad ( for meat or the ten gallons of oil they can yield ) . Nature Seekers has shown nesting turtles to seventy-five thousand people in the last ten years , with the numbers increasing . Now nearly everybody in Trinidad knows about their giant , endangered sea turtles . Poaching is much diminished . Nature Seekers is part of the Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Conservation Network , a driving force behind sea turtle recoveries in the Caribbean region . // Each time her tail flexes she pushes out two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little rubbery and a little papery . Turtle eggshells are n't brittle like birds ' eggs ; they 're something between leather and parchment . Incubation takes about two months if the sand is cool , perhaps six weeks if it 's hot . During that time the fertilized cell 's DNA code reassembles the yolk into a sea turtle . // Grandma Savita murmurs to the assembly , " If you want to touch the turtle , photograph the turtle , it will be okay now . " You 'd think egg laying would be the most sensitive and critical part of the nesting process . But while laying , Leatherbacks seem as if in a trance . // In the twenty years between 1980 and 2000 , the Leatherback Turtle lost an estimated 70 percent of its worldwide population . One study saw this decline in only fourteen years ; it estimated that Leatherback numbers plummeted from 115,000 adult females alive in 1982 to fewer than 35,000 by 1996 . A Leatherback 's two main problems are drowning in fishing gear and getting its eggs taken by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the decline is steep and deep , the World Conservation Union considers the species " critically endangered . " But Leatherback fortunes appear quite different in the two main oceans . Good records over several decades from its major rookeries in the Caribbean , Malaysia , and Mexico and detailed records from Costa Rica since the early 1990s tell this clearly : the Pacific Leatherback has crashed from an estimated 90,000-plus adult females living in 1980 to fewer than 5,000 by the threshold of the new millennium , down 95 percent . Conversely , Atlantic Leatherbacks seem generally stable , with some populations clearly increasing now from former lows. // Scott says , " We 've definitely got more turtles compared to what people saw in the 1970s through ' 90s . " About six thousand different individual females annually use several Trinidad beaches for nesting . Scott reports , " Trinidad 's going up ; Guyana and Suriname seem stable . The northern Caribbean and Florida population is growing exponentially . " // * * * // The skin on her rear flippers is very soft ; through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her head feels smooth . Her neck and shoulders are thick , soft , warmer than the sand . Her back feels unyielding under the normal pressure of a human hand ; but if you move your finger sideways , you can push the skin over the underlying bones . // Scott says these bones are like little interlocking pieces about an inch in diameter . " If you pressed her shell with the flat of your hand , you would actually see the outline of those little bones , " he notes . " It 's like a jigsaw puzzle under a drape . " The Leatherback 's " shell " is often described as rubbery , but to me it feels more like a smooth , dense pad , like a foam mat . Scratch it with your fingernail , and it 'll bleed . // When about seven dozen billiard-ball-sized eggs fill the chamber , the first of two dozen much smaller " eggs " fall from her . These strange small yolkless " eggs " have no embryos . Only Leatherbacks lay them , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air space at the top of the nest , stabilize its humidity , protect against fungus or insects , or provide elbow room for the unusually long-winged hatchlings . Even the experts do n't know . // Each Leatherback averages seven nests in a breeding season , about ten days apart . Though averaging an undistinguished 65 to 85 eggs-in the Pacific and Atlantic , **25;642;TOOLONG ' frequent nesting yields seasonal totals of 450 to 600 eggs , making them the egg-laying champions . ( Other sea turtle species nest two to four times , laying about 100 eggs per clutch . ) Quite probably , Leatherbacks can produce more offspring in a year than any reptile or mammal ; they leave birds in the dust . // The world 's most intrepid reptiles , Leatherbacks prefer ruggedly pounded shores . They like an open-faced , coarse-sand beach with a steep approach fully exposed to direct surf . Such dynamic beaches tend toward change , and many Leatherbacks lose nests to erosion even in good times . Because their beaches are not reliable , they put their eggs in different baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Scott , " next time , two kilometers down the beach , or twenty kilometers up that way . " Why would Leatherbacks want a steep , treacherous beach ? Possibly their immense size makes it important to avoid getting stranded in extensive shoals if the tide recedes while they 're ashore . Leatherbacks here like to emerge on flooding tides , when the water comes closest to the nesting sites . //
