OUTSIDE THE V-NOTE , A number of bums stood around the windows looking in . Inside , Monk was playing " Well You Need n't . " The place was smoky and full of mostly white faces , male college types , some couples , groups sitting at tables . I could n't get past the bar . <p> Monk was in the bridge ignoring the melody , sweating and banging out a major second in Monk time . Monk time is never quite where you expect it , until suddenly it is again . He moved the major second up a semitone , then he moved it down again . He loved that second . He kept it going with his right hand while he pulled out a handkerchief with his left hand and wiped his brow . When the head came around he finally skimmed down a whole tone scale and sat back to let Trane solo . <p> At the bar looking suave in an Italian suit was Miles Dewey Davis . Trane fumbled his entrance and Miles 's expression was blank . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant it . Over on the side of the room Coltrane 's wife Naima sat with a small microphone and a Wollensak tape recorder . <p> I went to the end of the bar and bought a pack of Luckies . The guy next to me gave me a goofy smile and said , L.S.M.F.T. , man , Lucky Strike means fine tobacco . He had a tiny goatee , which is a look that maybe one white guy in twenty can pull off . He was n't that guy . <p> A silver bud glinted in his ear , trailing a wire into his shirt pocket . He was listening to his PDA fill him in . Tourist . First timer . I turned away and lit up . It was always a kick to smoke indoors , a forbidden thrill where I came from . <p> I did n't have to see the goatee 's PDA to know it was quality . Mine was n't quality but it was mine and it worked . My pantemporal dilation apparatus . My personal time machine . Not what you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go back and kill Hitler , make the world a better place . What 's " better " ? <p> Ahmed Abdul-Malik was leaning hard into his bass and I was digging it . But I was n't here for Monk or his sidemen . The backwash from more powerful PDAs had dragged me here . No disrespect to the hat and beard , but I 'd seen this set before . This time I 'd come to hear my man Eric . He does n't show up on the hotlists , but I knew he was playing in the neighborhood . <p> I went to the crapper , dropped my cigarette and crushed it out . I tore the top off the packet and - what a waste - dumped the cigarettes into the trash . The ivory block of my PDA hid neatly in the packet , the dial and readout facing up . July 20 , 1957 . <p> When I came out Trane was ripping up the place with scales from Russia . The goatee at the bar , listening to his PDA , bounced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere white guy like me . He looked like he was on U. Just like me . <p> I walked out on Trane and into the New York summer night . That trademark smell of iron , urine , and asphalt . A black slash of infinity rose up forever between the buildings . The Third Avenue El roared by , its sound receding into a mix of car horns , sirens , background hum . I tried to spot the tourists among the natives . A pair of cops in short sleeves went by . On their biceps were matched tattoos , edges visible just below the sleeve , curved pincers touching to complete a circle . <p> After they passed I went into an alley , put the bead in my ear , and dialed . Eric was n't on any hotlist , but I knew that he gigged the V-Note for most of summer 1961 . So I dialed ahead four years exactly . I felt the tingling and humming back behind the bead , the realignment in my skull . The night shimmered with the vertigo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . July 16,1961 , said the readout . I walked out of the alley at New York speed , and let the whisper in my ear guide me up Cooper Square to St. Mark 's Place . <p> Soon I was at the V-Note again . Now the placard said : Eric Dolphy Quintet with Booker Little . I paid the cover and went in . Miles was here again . For a second I foolishly wondered how he 'd managed to jump ahead with me . He was sitting at a table with a white woman . Every so often he smiled at her , and when he did , his whole prince of darkness thing fell apart . He looked like a delighted kid . <p> I went to the bar and ordered a Gibson . I half expected to see the LSMFT guy again . Then I did see him . Or maybe not . It 's hard to tell the goatees apart . <p> It was n't a full house . Natives , mostly . Tourists had to go looking for Dolphy . Acts come on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past is being changed , or maybe it 's how the theory sites say : your memory adjusts to the changed history . The fact is , tourists do n't care . I cared , but since this was the first time I 'd found Eric , I was n't going to worry about it . <p> An MC came onstage . He was a little moonfaced cat with an impish smile and a natty mustache , in a Brooks Brothers suit . He smoothed the ' fabric over his pot while his lazy eyes counted the house . He did n't seem impressed . <p> Layduz jemmin ! Welcome the very latest sound in jazz , Mister Eric Dolphy , featuring the new trumpet sensation , Booker Little ! How bout a big hand now ! Mister Eric Dolphy ! <p> Applause was fierce but sparse . He was smaller than I expected . Almost frail . He looked nervous . But it was him all right . Domed forehead , broad lips , thick eyebrows , mustache , goatee . He shut his eyes and for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from his stillness . <p> He lifted his flute and the opening notes of " Do n't Blame Me " spilled out . It surprised me . I thought I knew everything about these dates , but that tune was n't on my list . It appeared to surprise the MC , too , who moved closer to the bandstand . <p> It was a sweet ballad , with lots of room for filigree , and Eric made the most of it . He frowned throughout his entire solo , and he kept pushing the flute 's sweetness into harshness , as if he could find notes there that nobody else could . <p> During the applause he set down the flute and picked up his bass clarinet . He nodded at Booker and they swung hard into " Aggression . " Booker soloed for about five minutes . Eric 's horn solo was even harsher . He was sweating , jabbing runs in against the time . Then he launched into outer space . I knew this cut , all the bonus tracks , the variants , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dolphy , and put his trumpet on the floor . Mal Waldron quit playing and leaned on the piano desk . For a while the bass and drums tried to sketch out where Eric was supposed to be in the tune , but he was always somewhere else . Then they stopped completely , and Eric was honking and wailing and stuttering all by himself , gasping deep breaths between runs . <p> The MC was at the edge of the bandstand now . He stood there for about a minute . Then he looked over his shoulder and made a gesture . <p> Dolphy was manhandled offstage by three burly white guys with those tattoos on their biceps . As their sleeves rode up you could see where the top of the pincers joined a pair of circles in a trefoil . Booker moved back to let the MC up on the bandstand . The MC was smiling but his eyes were deadly . <p> Layduz jemmin sorry for the irruption . We 'll take a ten-minute intermission . The bar is open . <p> I got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley I heard a metal door clang open . <p> The MC was shoving him out the door . He was still holding his horn . You come in here playing like some hopped up Bird - ! <p> Hey man , I ai n't Bird ! Hey hey give me that <p> And you do n't come in here with your goddamn smack ! The MC threw something to the pavement and stepped on it . <p> Shit man ! That 's my insulin ! <p> The door slammed . Eric looked at the ground and shook his head . I went into the alley . <p> What happened ? <p> He looked up and took me in . <p> Seems the gentleman did n't like the way I played . <p> Who is that guy ? Since when is there an MC at the V-Note ? <p> Mister Winston , we call him . From the Ministry of True Jazz . Used to perform , himself . I got to go ... and he started walking . <p> Hey listen , I said , I came to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . <p> No , I mean it , you 're the greatest . What you did in there <p> He looked at me , smiling a little . You like that weird shit ? <p> Well ... yeah . <p> Least I can play . Most of these cats here ca n't barely play their instruments . <p> That 's a little ... harsh , is n't it ? <p> No idea , he said . White boy 's got no idea what he 's talkin about . You want to get hip ? Come on with me . <p> We turned and walked a few blocks . I was walking with Eric Dolphy and I could n't think of a thing to say that was n't stupid . I 've heard all your albums . Where do you live ? How much do you practice ? Who are your favorite sidemen ? <p> We stopped at a red light and the El thundered overhead . The V-Note - another V-Note ? - came up before us . <p> Hey did we turn around or ... ? <p> Miles came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smiling and talking . He stopped under the streetlamp to light a cigarette . Almost immediately a cop in short sleeves came up . <p> No loitering , the cop said to Miles . Move along . <p> I work here , said Miles . <p> I said move . <p> I 'm not goin nowhere , I 'm just getting a breath of air . <p> Move now ! <p> What are you gon na do , lock me up ? <p> The cop reached for Miles 's wrist . Miles pulled away . Another guy in plainclothes came out of nowhere with a nightstick . Miles went down , cursing , holding his head . Blood seeped out between his fingers . A crowd had gathered . <p> Move it along ! Nothing to see . The plainclothes cop looked hard at me . I felt a hand on my arm pulling me away . The hand was Dolphy 's . <p> Miles , he 's fucked now , they 'll pull his card . You ca n't work in this town without a card . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it . I was trying to think through how Miles had been at the first club four years ago , the second one tonight , now here again . <p> It was never a life , Eric said . You try to make it one , and that 's what you get . Live fast , die young , leave a catalog , that 's all they ever wanted . <p> Hey , I said , alarmed . You do n't want to do that . You want to take care of yourself . Especially , you know , your diabetes . <p> He looked at me again , quick and suspicious . It 's how he died . Would die . Not drugs , not alcohol , just negligence of blood sugar . He looked at me like he was trying to figure out what I meant . Then he got angry . <p> I do n't want to do what ? Leave a catalog ? What the hell do you think I 'm doin here beatin my head against this wall ? <p> No , not that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die so young . <p> I 'd blown it . How was I supposed to know when he 'd die ? Now his expression was dire . <p> Who the hell are you to tell me that ? You think I do n't know the history ? The whole fucking necrology of jazz ? Bird gone at thirty-four , Fats at twenty-seven , Clifford at twenty-six , Bud , Trane , Booker .... He looked back toward the club and shook his head . Not me , man . I 'm not walkin that road . <p> I got some of it ... but Bud Powell and Coltrane ? They were alive . Booker had been right there onstage with him . Had I got off on some other time track , some other 1961 where history had changed ? I tried to look at my PDA but I could n't read it inside the Luckies pack . <p> Do n't you get it yet ? I 'm a performer , man . <p> Yeah , I know , you 're great - . As I looked down into my pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luckies pack , and threw it to the ground . <p> Hey - ! That 's my - ! and I was down on my knees trying to find it . <p> That 's your what . Say it . <p> That 's my - ! <p> You ever try to dial that shit forward of about , like , 1963 ? see how far you get . <p> The case was broken . I picked it out of the gutter and as I stood to inspect it he snapped his fingers under my nose . Yo ! Wake up , man ! Look at me instead of that shit ! <p> His face swam in and out of focus . He did n't look like Dolphy now . He was n't skinny . He was n't spiritual . He was big , ungainly . His forehead receded , and he had a long scar down one cheek . He did n't even have a mustache or goatee . I could see a few silver marks at the corners of his lips , his eyes , his nose . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dream and he still looked a little like Dolphy to me . <p> Listen to me , he said . They got the music , the recordings , they tied up copyright for the next hundred years , but that 's not enough for them . You got to put a face on it . So they expanded copyright to cover the content , the image , the likeness , the life , everything . We need the whole package , they said . So here we are . Owned again . <p> Where do you think you are ? he said . I got busted for that shit you 're on now . That U. Nice stuff , is n't it . Take enough you can believe whatever . It 's legal in here , but I got five to ten for dealing it on the street . I did three years and got parole cause I can play , so now I got this good job lip-syncing old Dolphy gigs . Thing is , I really can play . And I got sick of pretending it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you want of H and U and whatever else . Some of these sorry motherfuckers take so much they actually think they 're Bird . That shit in your Luckies pack , you got the guided tour . The drug , the post-hypnotic suggestion , the scenery - he spread his arms to embrace the alley , the back door of the V-Note - and the performers . Welcome to Birdland . He raised the horn to his lips , and played two fast and perfect bars of " Ornithology . " <p> I looked at my dead PDA . I was waking from a good dream . He was n't Dolphy . He was a nobody from prison with a pawn shop horn . I was n't anywhere but on vacation from my own life . <p> He walked off holding the horn in one hand and I followed . Maybe it should n't have surprised me when Eighth Street crossed Fifty-second Street . Somewhere I heard a trumpet playing " Perdido . " Around the next corner was the Cotton Club . From there , way up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra glided through " Mood Indigo , " we crossed a street into downtown Chicago , where a sign outside the Dreamland Cafe announced Louis Armstrong and his hot Five , a band that had never played live . The El thundered overhead . <p> None of that free jazz shit in our Chicago , he said . <p> You mean , all this ... everyone ... Miles ... ? <p> We got a couple of Miles who just hang out . Tourists like to see him around . It 's value added . That 's a famous incident you witnessed back there . 1959 it happened , outside of Birdland . They do n't always trouble to get the details exactly right . <p> And your insulin , I said . Another prop ? <p> Oh no , he said . I got diabetes all right . Induced . That 's their verisimilitude . <p> We were out somewhere near the East River . He stood listening for something , it seemed , fingering the keys of his horn . <p> Guess they 'll take Eric off the menus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trane , they 'll want to keep an eye on him . Keep him on the Disney tunes . He honked a few notes of " My Favorite Things . " <p> Then he started to really play , taking up more or less where he 'd been interrupted on the bandstand . It was n't like anything I 'd ever heard . Started like a kind of lament but moved quickly into toughness . It filled me with , what exactly ? Not sadness . Despair , I guess . It came at me like a torrent of bad news , stopping and starting , moving in and out of time , skidding and surfing on top of that news . Here we are in the present , this is what it looks like , and that 's all there is ; how do you like it ? When he quit I heard a far-off thudding sound , polyrhythmic , the thing he must have been riffing off . <p> You do n't get it , he said . He was smiling . <p> I got it but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to be in the pain of the present , and I did n't want to be reminded that I had no choice . <p> Uh oh , he said . Here comes Mickey . <p> Two guys rounded the corner . They were in sleeveless T-shirts . In the streetlight I could see their tattoos , the razorwire trefoil , the round head and two ears . <p> Let 's go , iron man , said one to Dolphy . <p> Outside the V-Note the bums were still standing around . The club was closed . We were the trash on the street . The robot sweepers scurried toward us like cartoon rats . We bums took the hint and dispersed . <p> I went down Great Jones Street toward the East River . Dawn lighted the New York skyline and made it look flat as a set . Past some dumpsters and a couple of police barriers , the street abruptly ended in chainlink overlooking not the river , not Brooklyn , not Queens , but gray ocean to the horizon . There was a sea breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile offshore , breakers exploded against the great Florida seawall . Barges carrying cranes floated there , ready to stack concrete caissons on the wall . The Dutch piledrivers were thudding as they had been all night . Now they were all I could hear . A couple of cops came along to return me to that blasted world . <p> IMG
