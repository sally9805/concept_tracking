The serious business of the Republican Convention was Big Business . Nowhere was that more apparent than in the face-off between two powerful House members vying for chairmanship of the committee that corporate America cares most about  --  the House Commerce Committee . <P> The Ox and the Swamp Fox  --  Ohio Representative Mike Oxley and Louisiana Representative Billy Tauzin  --  held dueling parties during the week , bankrolled by many of the companies regulated by the committees . Both lawmakers drew on their personal traditions . Tauzin threw a mini Mardi Gras featuring Cajun cuisine , flashy beads and the New Orleans sound of the Neville Family Celebration . Oxley reached back to his love of early rock ' n ' roll with a lineup that included Chubby Checker and Frankie Avalon at the site of the old American Bandstand show , where his wife used to dance as a Philadelphia bobby-soxer . The immemorial Dick Clark emceed . <P> Each Congressman was trying to outmaneuver the other in what is something of a popularity contest . But the sponsors of the festivities had their eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins scarcely matters to them so long as they maintain access to the winner . <P> Which explains why such corporate underwriters as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter , SBC Communications and Philip Morris wrote big checks for both fetes . Total cost of the two parties : about $1 million . <P> The rivalry between the two lawmakers dates back to 1995 , when Tauzin , then a Democrat , switched parties and was rewarded with the chairmanship of a key subcommittee  --  though not before an angry Oxley , whose seniority was being usurped , weighed in and forced House Speaker Newt Gingrich to split the subcommittee in two . Now Oxley oversees the financial industry and hazardous-waste issues , and Tauzin looks after telecommunications and trade . <P> The opponents are doing more than throw parties to line up support . They are handing out real cash . <P> Each has a safe seat in his home district , and both have raised funds aplenty to dole out as favors to the campaigns of other House members . So far in this election season , the Cajun has raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of it through bayou-flavored luncheons for colleagues that net up to $50,000 each . Oxley has done better than $5 million . <P> A staff member close to Tauzin says , " Billy thinks it 's in the bag . " Maybe . The November contest for control of the House is tight , and odds are about even that the chairmanship will fall to neither Tauzin nor Oxley but to that old lion of the Democratic Party John Dingell . <P> But if the Republicans hold their majority , any effort that Oxley and Tauzin have made will be worth it . " You ca n't say , ' I 'm not going to play this game , ' " says Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma , a colleague on the committee . " The competition would eat you for lunch .
