Marseille September 1997 Marseille was a fine place to die and had been for centuries . The legendary seaport retained a reputation as a lair for pirates , smugglers , and cutthroats , a status enjoyed since the Romans wrestled it from the Greeks in the days before Christ . By the end of the twentieth century , the French government 's efforts at whitewash finally made it safe to enjoy bouillabaisse without the fear of getting mugged . Still , crime held no shock value for the locals . Mayhem was ingrained in their history and genetics . The leathered fishermen did n't blink when their nets yielded a catch that would prove unsuitable for inclusion in the local fish stew . Roger-Bernard Gelis was not a native of Marseille . He was born and raised in the foothills of the Pyrenees , in a community that existed proudly as a living anachronism . The twentieth century had not infringed on his culture , an ancient one that revered the powers of love and peace over all earthly matters . Still , he was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , the leader of his people . And while his community dwelled together in a deeplyspiritual peace , they had their share of enemies . Roger-Bernard was fond of saying that the greatest light attracts the deepest darkness . He was a giant of a man , an imposing figure to strangers . Those who did not know the gentleness that permeated Roger-Bernard 's spirit might have mistaken him for someone to be feared . Later , it would be assumed that his attackers were not unknown to him . He should have seen it coming , should have anticipated that he would not be left to carry such a priceless object in absolute freedom . Had n't almost a million of his ancestors died for the sake of this same treasure ? But the shot came from behind , splintering his skull before he even knew the enemy was near . Forensic evidence from the bullet would prove useless to the police , as the killers did not end their attack on a note of simplicity . There must have been several of them as the sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manpower to accomplish what came next . It was a mercy that Roger-Bernard was dead before the ritual began . He was spared the gloating of his killers as they set about their gruesome task . The leader was particularly filled with zeal for what came next , chanting his ancient mantra of hate as he worked . " Neca eos omnes . Neca eos omnes . " To sever a human head from its resting place on the body is a messy and difficult business . It requires strength , determination , and a very sharp instrument . Those who murdered Roger-Bernard Gelis had all of these things , and used them with the utmost efficiency . The body had been at sea for a long time , battered by the tide and chewed by hungry inhabitants of the deep . The investigators were so disheartened by the ragged condition of the corpse that they assigned little significance to the missing digit on one hand . An autopsy , buried later by bureaucracy  --  and perhaps something more  --  simply noted that the right index finger had been severed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jerusalem was filled with the frenetic activity of a Friday afternoon . History hung heavy in the rarified and holy air as the faithful hurried to houses of worship in preparation for their respective sabbaths . Christians wandered the Via Dolorosa , the Way of Sorrow , a series of winding and cobbled streets that marked the path of the crucifixion . It was here that a battered and bleeding Jesus Christ shouldered a heavy burden , making his way to a divine fate atop the hill of Golgotha . On this autumn afternoon American author Maureen Paschal appeared no different from the other pilgrims who made their way from distant and varied corners of the earth . The heady September breeze blended the aroma of sizzling shwarma with the scent of exotic oils that wafted from the ancient markets . Maureen drifted through the sensory overload that is Israel , clutching a guidebook purchased from a Christian organization on the Internet . The guide detailed the Way of the Cross , complete with maps and directions to the fourteen stations of Christ 's path . " Lady , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady , you want tour guide ? You never get lost . I show you everything . " Like most Western women , she was forced to fend off the unwanted advances of Jerusalem street merchants . Some were relentless in their efforts to hawk their wares or services . Others were merely attracted to the petite woman with long red hair and fair coloring , an exotic combination in this part of the world . Maureen rebuffed her pursuers with a polite but firm " No , thank you . " Then she broke eye contact and walked away . Her cousin Peter , an expert in Middle Eastern studies , had prepped her for the culture of the Old City . Maureen was painstaking about even the tiniest details in her work and had studied the evolving culture of Jerusalem carefully . So far it was paying off , and Maureen was able to keep the distractions to a minimum as she focused on her research , scribbling details and observations in her Moleskine notebook . She had been moved to tears by the intensity and beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered his scourging . It was a deeply unexpected emotional reaction as Maureen did not come to Jerusalem as a pilgrim . Instead , she came as an investigative observer , as a writer in search of an accurate historical backdrop for her work . While Maureen sought a deeper understanding of the events of Good Friday , she approached this research from her head rather than her heart . She visited the Convent of the Sisters of Sion , before moving to the neighboring Chapel of Condemnation , the legendary location where Jesus was given his cross after the sentence of crucifixion had been passed by Pontius Pilate . Again , the unexpected lump in her throat was accompanied by an overwhelming sense of grief as she walked through the building . Life-size bas-relief sculptures illustrated the events of a terrible morning 2,000 years earlier . Maureen stood , riveted , by a vivid scene of haunting humanity : a male disciple as he tried to shield Mary , the mother of Jesus , to spare her the sight of her son carrying His cross . Tears stung at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . It was the first time in her life she had thought of these larger-than-life historical figures as real people , flesh-and-blood humans suffering through an event of nearly unimaginable anguish . Feeling momentarily dizzy , Maureen steadied herself with a hand against the cool stones of an ancient wall . She paused to refocus before taking more notes on the artwork and sculpture . She continued on her path , but the labyrinthine streets of the Old City proved deceiving , even with a carefully drawn map . The landmarks were often ancient , weathered , and easily missed by those unfamiliar with their whereabouts . Maureen cursed silently as she realized she was lost again . She stopped in the shelter of a shop doorway , shielding herself from the direct sunlight . The intensity of the heat , even with the slight breeze , belied the lateness of the season . Shielding the guidebook from the glare , she looked around , attempting to get her bearings . " The Eighth Station of the Cross . It has to be around here somewhere , " she muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen , for her work centered on this history as it pertained to women . Referring back to the guidebook , she continued to read a passage from the Gospels that pertained to Station Eight . " A large number of people followed him , including women who mourned and wailed for him . Jesus said , ' Weep not for me , daughters of Jerusalem , weep for yourselves and for your children . ' " Maureen was startled by a sharp knock on the window behind her . She looked up , expecting to see an angry proprietor glaring at her for blocking his doorway . But the face that looked back at her was beaming . An immaculately dressed , middle-aged Palestinian man opened the door to the antiquities shop , beckoning Maureen in . When he spoke it was in beautiful , if accented , English . " Come in , please . Welcome , I am Mahmoud . You are lost ? " Maureen waved the guidebook lamely . " I 'm looking for the Eighth Station . The map shows . . . " Mahmoud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . Station Eight . Jesus Meets the Holy Women of Jerusalem . It is just out here and around the corner , " he gestured . " A cross above the stone wall marks it , but you have to look very carefully . " Mahmoud looked at Maureen intently for a moment before continuing . " It is like everything else in Jerusalem . You have to look very carefully to see it for what it is . " Maureen watched his gestures , satisfied that she understood the directions . Smiling , she thanked him and turned to leave , but stopped as something on a nearby shelf caught her eye . Mahmoud 's shop was one of the more upscale establishments in Jerusalem , selling authenticated antiquities  --  oil lamps from the time of Christ , coins with the emblem of Pontius Pilate . An exquisite shimmer of color coming through the window attracted Maureen . " That 's jewelry made from shards of Roman glass , " Mahmoud explained as Maureen approached an artful display rack of silver and gold jewelry embedded with jeweled mosaics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up a silver pendant . Prisms of color darted through the shop as she held the jewelry up to the light , illuminating her writer 's imagination . " I wonder what story this glass could tell ? " " Who knows what it once was ? " Mahmoud shrugged . " A perfume bottle ? A spice jar ? A vase for roses or lilies ? " " It 's amazing to think that two thousand years ago this was an everyday object in someone 's home . Fascinating . " Giving the shop and its contents closer inspection , Maureen was struck by the quality of the items and the beauty of the displays . She reached out to run a finger lightly over a ceramic oil lamp . " Is this really two thousand years old ? " " Of course . Some of my items are older still . " Maureen shook her head . " Do n't antiquities like this belong in a museum ? " Mahmoud laughed , a rich and hearty sound . " My dear , all of Jerusalem is a museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of great antiquity . Most of the truly valuable go into important collections . But not everything . " Maureen moved to a glass case , filled with ancient jewelry of hammered , oxidized copper . She stopped , her attention grabbed by a ring that supported a disc the size of a small coin . Following her gaze , Mahmoud removed the ring from the case , holding it out to her . A sunbeam from the front window caught the ring , illuminating its round base and showing off a pattern of nine hammered dots surrounding a central circle . " Very interesting choice , " Mahmoud said . His jovial manner had changed . He was now intense and serious , watching Maureen closely as she questioned him about the ring . " How old is this ? " " It 's hard to say . My experts said it was Byzantine , probably sixth or seventh century , but possibly older . " Maureen looked closely at the pattern made by the circles . " This pattern seems . . . familiar . I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it symbolizes anything ? " Mahmoud 's intensity relaxed . " I can not say for certain what an artisan meant to create fifteen hundred years ago . But I have been told that it was the ring of a cosmologist . " " A cosmologist ? " " Someone who understands the relation between the earth and the cosmos . As above , so below . And I must say that the first time I saw it , it reminded me of the planets , dancing around the sun . " Maureen counted the dots aloud . " Seven , eight , nine . But they would n't have known there were nine planets back then , or that the sun was the center of the solar system . It could n't be that , could it ? " " We can not assume to know what the ancients understood . " Mahmoud shrugged . " Try it on . " Maureen , suddenly sensing a sales pitch , handed the ring back to Mahmoud . " Oh , no , thank you . It 's really beautiful , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't spend money today . " " That 's fine , " said Mahmoud , pointedly refusing to take the ring from her . " Because it 's not for sale anyway . " " It 's not ? " " No . Many people have offered to buy that ring . I refuse to sell it . So you may feel free to try it on . Just for fun . " Maybe it was because the playfulness had returned to his tone and she felt less pressured , or maybe it was the attraction of the unexplained , ancient pattern . But something caused Maureen to slip the copper disc onto her right ring finger . It fit perfectly . Mahmoud nodded , serious again , almost whispering to himself , " As if it had been made for you . " Maureen held the ring up to the light , looking at it on her hand . " I ca n't take my eyes off of it . " " That 's because you 're supposed to have it . " Maureen looked up suspiciously , sensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street vendors , but he was a merchant all the same . " I thought you said it was n't for sale . " She began to take the ring off , to which the shopkeeper objected vehemently , holding up his hands in protest . " No . Please . " " Okay , okay . This is where we haggle , right ? How much is it ? " Mahmoud looked seriously offended for a moment before replying . " You misunderstand . That ring was entrusted to me , until I found the right hand for it . The hand it was made for . I see now that it was your hand . I can not sell it to you because it is already yours . " Maureen looked down at the ring , and then back up at Mahmoud , puzzled . " I do n't understand . " Mahmoud smiled sagely , and moved toward the front door of the shop . " No , you do n't . But one day you will . For now , just keep the ring . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You can and you will . You must . If you do not , I will have failed . You would not want that on your conscience , of course . " Maureen shook her head in bewilderment as she followed him to the front door , pausing . " I really do n't know what to say , or how to thank you . " " No need , no need . But now you must go . The mysteries of Jerusalem are waiting for you . " Mahmoud held the door for her as Maureen stepped through it , thanking him again . " Good-bye , Magdalena , " he whispered as she walked out . Maureen stopped , turning quickly back to him . " I 'm sorry ? " Mahmoud smiled his sage , enigmatic smile . " I said good-bye , my lady . " And he waved at Maureen as she returned the gesture , stepping out again into the harsh Middle Eastern sun . Maureen returned to the Via Dolorosa , where she found the Eighth Station just as Mahmoud had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate , feeling strange after the encounter with the shopkeeper . Continuing on her path , the earlier sense of dizziness returned , stronger this time , to the point of disorientation . It was her first day in Jerusalem , and she was undoubtedly suffering jet lag . The flight from Los Angeles had been long and arduous , and she had n't slept much the night before . Whether it was a combination of heat , exhaustion , and hunger , or something more unexplainable , what happened next was outside Maureen 's realm of experience . Finding a stone bench , Maureen eased herself down to rest . She swayed with another wave of unexpected vertigo as a blinding flash emanated from the relentless sun , transporting her thoughts . She was thrown abruptly into the middle of a mob . All around her was chaos  --  there was much shouting and shoving , great commotion on all sides . Maureen had enough of her modern wits about her to notice that the swarming figures were robed in coarse , homespun garments . Those who had shoes wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one stepped down hard on her foot . Most were men , bearded and grimy . The omnipresent sun of early afternoon beat down upon them , mixing sweat with dirt on the angry and distressed faces around her . She was at the edge of a narrow road , and the crowd just ahead began to jostle emphatically . A natural gap was evolving , and a small group moved slowly along the path . The mob appeared to be following this huddle . As the moving mass came closer , Maureen saw the woman for the first time . A solitary and still island in the center of the chaos , she was one of the few women in the crowd  --  but that was not what made her different . It was her bearing , a regal demeanor that marked her as a queen despite the layer of dirt covering her hands and feet . She was slightly disheveled , lustrous auburn hair tucked partially beneath a crimson veil that covered the lower half of her face . Maureen knew instinctively that she had to reach this woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to her . But the writhing crowd held her back , and she was moving in the slow-motion thickness of a dream state . As she continued to struggle in the direction of the woman , the aching beauty of the face that was just out of her reach struck Maureen . She was fine-boned , with exquisite , delicate features . But it was her eyes that would haunt Maureen long after the vision was over . The woman 's eyes , huge and bright with unshed tears , fell somewhere in the color spectrum between amber and sage , an extraordinary light hazel that reflected infinite wisdom and unbearable sadness in one heart-searing blend . The woman 's soul-swallowing gaze met Maureen in a brief and interminable moment , conveying through those improbable eyes a plea of complete and utter desperation . You must help me . Maureen knew that the plea was directed at her . She was entranced , frozen , as her eyes locked with the woman . The moment was broken when the woman looked down suddenly at a young girl who tugged urgently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazel eyes that echoed her mother 's . Behind her stood a boy , older and with darker eyes than the little girl , but clearly the son of this woman . Maureen knew in that inexplicable instant that she was the only person who could help this strange , suffering queen and her children . A swell of intense confusion , and something that felt far too much like grief , moved through her at this realization . Then the mob surged again , drowning Maureen in a sea of sweat and despair . Maureen blinked hard , holding her eyes shut tight for a few seconds . She shook her head briskly to clear her vision , not certain at first where she was . A glance down at her jeans , microfiber backpack , and Nike walking shoes provided reassurance from the twentieth century . Around her the bustle of the Old City continued , but the people were dressed in contemporary fashions and the sounds were different now : Radio Jordan blasted an American pop song  --  was that R.E.M . ' s " Losing My Religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A teenage Palestinian boy kept time , drumming on the countertop . He smiled at her without missing a beat . Rising from the bench , Maureen attempted to shake off the vision , if that 's what it had been . She was n't sure what it was , nor could she allow herself to dwell on it . Her time in Jerusalem was limited and she had 2,000 years of sights to see . Summoning her journalist 's discipline and a lifetime 's experience of suppressing her emotions , she filed the vision under " research for later analysis " and pushed herself to keep moving . Maureen found herself merging with a swarm of British tourists as they rounded the corner , led by a guide wearing the collar of an Anglican priest . He announced to his group of pilgrims that they were approaching the most sacred site in Christendom , the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher . Maureen knew from her research that the remaining Stations of the Cross were contained within that revered building . Spanning several blocks , the basilica covered the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed to protect this sacred ground in the fourth century . Helena , who was also the mother of the Holy Roman Emperor Constantine , was later canonized for her efforts . Maureen approached the enormous entrance doors slowly and with some hesitation . She realized as she stood on the threshold that she had not been inside a real church in many years , nor did she relish the thought of changing that status now . She reminded herself firmly that the research that had brought her to Israel was scholarly rather than spiritual . As long as she remained focused , with that perspective , she could do it . She could walk through those doors . Despite her reluctance , there was something unmistakably awe-inspiring and magnetic about this colossal shrine . As she stepped through the mammoth doorway , she heard the British priest 's words ring out : " Within these walls , you will see where Our Lord made the ultimate sacrifice . Where He was stripped of His robes , where He was nailed to the cross . You will enter the holy tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Christ , once you enter this place , your lives will never be the same . " The heavy and unmistakable smell of frankincense swirled past Maureen as she entered . Pilgrims from all walks of Christendom surrounded this place and filled the mammoth spaces inside the basilica . She passed a group of Coptic priests huddled in hushed , reverent discussion and watched a Greek Orthodox cleric light a candle in one of the small chapels . A male choir sang in an Eastern dialect , an exotic sound to Western ears , the hymn rising up from some secret space within the church . Maureen was taking in the overwhelming sights and sounds of this place , and was feeling aimless from the sensory overload . She did not see the wiry little man who eased up beside her until he tapped her on the shoulder , causing her to jump . " Sorry , Miss . Sorry , Miss Mo-ree . " He spoke English , but unlike the enigmatic shopkeeper Mahmoud , his accent was very heavy . His skills with Maureen 's language were rudimentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand at first that he was calling her by her first name . He repeated himself . " Mo-ree . Your name . It is Mo-ree , yes ? " Maureen was puzzled , trying to determine if this strange little man was actually calling her by name and , if so , how he knew it . She had been in Jerusalem for fewer than twenty-four hours , and no one save the front desk clerk at the King David Hotel knew her name . But this man was impatient , asking again . " Mo-ree . You are Mo-ree . Writer . You write , yes ? Mo-ree ? " Nodding slowly , Maureen answered . " Yes . My name is Maureen . But how  --  how did you know ? " The little man ignored the question , grabbing her hand and pulling her across the church floor . " No time , no time . Come . We wait a long time for you . Come , come . " For such a small man  --  he was shorter than Maureen , who was herself uncommonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him through the belly of the basilica , past the line where pilgrims waited to be admitted to the Tomb of Christ . He kept moving until they reached a small altar near the rear of the building , and stopped suddenly . The area was dominated by a life-size bronze sculpture of a woman holding outstretched arms to a man in a beseeching pose . " Chapel of Mary Magdalene . Magdalena . You come for her , yes ? Yes ? " Maureen nodded cautiously , looking at the sculpture and down at the plaque that read : IN THIS PLACE , MARY MAGDALENE WAS THE FIRST TO SEE THE RISEN LORD . She read aloud the quotation from another plaque beneath the bronze : " Woman , why weepest thou ? Who is it you are looking for ? " Maureen had little time to contemplate the question as the odd little man was pulling at her again , hurrying at his unlikely pace to another , darker corner of the basilica . " Come , come . " They rounded a corner and stopped in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . Time , incense , and centuries of oily candle residue had taken their toll on the artwork , causing Maureen to move close to the dark portrait , squinting . The little man narrated in a voice grown deeply serious . " Painting very old . Greek . You understand ? Greek . Most important of Our Lady . She needs you to tell her story . This is why you come here , Mo-ree . We have waited a long time for you . She has waited . For you . Yes ? " Maureen looked carefully at the painting , a dark , ancient portrait of a woman wearing a red cloak . She turned to the little man , intensely curious now as to where this was taking her . But he was gone  --  he had vanished as quickly as he had appeared . " Wait ! " Maureen 's cry rang out in the echo chamber of the massive church , but it remained unanswered . She returned her attention to the painting . As she leaned closer to the portrait , she observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a round copper disk , with a pattern depicting nine circles surrounding a central sphere . Maureen lifted her right hand , the one with her newly acquired ring , to compare it to the painting . The rings were identical . . . . Much will be said and written in time to come of Simon , the Fisher of Men . Of how he was called the rock , Peter , by Easa and myself while the others called him Cephas , which was natural in their own tongue . And if history is just , it will tell of how he loved Easa with unmatched power and loyalty . And much has already been said , or so I am told , about my own relationship with Simon-Peter . There are those who called us adversaries , enemies . They would have it be believed that Peter despised me and we fought for the attention of Easa at every turn . And there are those who would call Peter a hater of women  --  but this is an accusation that can be applied to no one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who followed Easa did ever belittle a woman or underestimate her value in God 's plan . Any man who does so and claims Easa as teacher speaks a lie . It is untrue , these accusations against Peter . Those who witnessed Peter 's criticism of me do not know of our history or from what source come his outbursts . But I understand and will not judge him , ever . This , above all else , is what Easa has taught me  --  and I hope he taught it as well to the others . Judge not .
