Consistency is one of those qualities that act like a virtue without necessarily being one . While we would like our Presidents to be consistently wise , it is the wisdom we are really after . But consistency and its cousin certainty still hold a sacred place in our politics . The charge that a candidate has flip-flopped on some position is not a political attack so much as a personal one . It is less about the issues being debated than about the instincts being revealed , about honor and honesty and nerve under fire . How tight the label sticks depends a lot on the impression voters have already formed , which means that a less well-known candidate can be vulnerable in ways a familiar one may not be . <P> No mission has been more urgent for the Bush-Cheney operation than to seize this moment , in the springtime of the campaign , when all impressions about the challenger are new , to convince voters that John Kerry is an opportunist tethered to no core beliefs , a serial side switcher on everything from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills , " says Vice President Dick Cheney in his stump speech , with characteristic subtlety . " These are not times for leaders who shift with the political winds , saying one thing one day and another thing the next . " The President himself has leveled the charge , though more lightly than Cheney does , more mocking than warning . " My opponent clearly has strong beliefs , " George Bush says of Kerry . " They just do n't last very long . " <P> In fact , the very week that President Bush executed a spectacular backflip with a twist , agreeing after weeks of refusal to let National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice testify publicly and under oath before the 9/11 commission , the polls suggested that his strategy of painting Kerry as a waffler was working , especially in battleground states , where Kerry 's 28% advantage over Bush coming out of the primaries has all but disappeared . While the race remains very tight in most polls , some showed Kerry 's unfavorable ratings climbing 10 points in the weeks since he secured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was the stronger leader , 46% picked Bush ; 38% chose Kerry . <P> How can a line of fire that is bruising Kerry seem to bounce off Bush ? As Kerry 's defenders are quick to note , the President had a fairly acrobatic record even before the Condi flip , doubling back on everything from his " humble " foreign policy to steel tariffs , opposing the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance bill and then signing it , calling gay marriage a state issue and then backing a federal ban on it . In fact , the Times poll found , roughly equal numbers of voters see Bush and Kerry as flip-floppers ( 35% and 38% , respectively ) . But what matters is not the perception so much as the damage it does . Asked by a recent Gallup poll who is more likely to change his positions on issues for political reasons , 49% said Kerry , and 37% said Bush .
