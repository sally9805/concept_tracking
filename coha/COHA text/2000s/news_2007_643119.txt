<p> A WEEK 'S worth of dinners for young Fiona Jacobson looks like this : Noodles . Noodles . Noodles . Noodles . French fries . Noodles . On the seventh day , the 5-year-old from Forest Hills , Queens , might indulge in a piece of pizza crust , with no sauce or cheese . <p> Over in New Jersey , the Bakers changed their November family vacation to accommodate Sasha , an 11-year-old so averse to fruits and vegetables that the smell of orange juice once made him faint . Instead of flying to Prague , Sasha 's parents decided to go to Barcelona , where they hope the food will be more to his liking . <p> And at the Useloff household , young Ethan 's tastes are so narrow that their home in Westfield , N.J. , works something like a diner . <p> " I do the terrible mommy thing and make everyone separate dinners , " Jennifer Useloff said . <p> All three families share a common problem . Their children are not only picky eaters , prone to reject foods they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means they fear new food . <p> But for parents who worry that their children will never eat anything but chocolate milk , Gummi vitamins and the occasional grape , a new study offers some relief . Researchers examined the eating habits of 5,390 pairs of twins between 8 and 11 years old and found children 's aversions to trying new foods are mostly inherited . <p> The message to parents : It 's not your cooking , it 's your genes . <p> The study , led by Dr. Lucy Cooke of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London , was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in August . Dr. Cooke and others in the field believe it is the first to use a standard scale to investigate the contribution of genetics and environment to childhood neophobia . <p> According to the report , 78 percent is genetic and the other 22 percent environmental . <p> " People have really dismissed this as an idea because they have been looking at the social associations between parents and their children , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not wanting to blame parents . " <p> Nutritionists , pediatricians and academic researchers have recently shifted focus to children who eat too much instead of those who eat too little . But cases of obesity are less frequent than bouts of pickiness . <p> In some families , communal meals become brutal battlegrounds , if they have n't been altogether abandoned . Cooks break under the weight of devising a thousand variations on macaroni and cheese . Strolls through the farmers ' markets are replaced with trudges through the frozen food aisle . <p> For parents who know that sharing the fruits of the kitchen with family is one of the deep pleasures of cooking , having a child who rejects most food is a unique sort of heartbreak . <p> Hugh Garvey , an editor at Bon Appetit magazine , knows the heartbreak firsthand . He shares his experience on gastrokid.com , a blog he created with a British pal that details the gastronomic life of families . His daughter , 6 , is an omnivore 's dream child . But his son , 3 , will eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself is the way any quasi-sane parent comforts himself , " Mr. Garvey said . " It 's like potty training . Eventually , they 're going to graduate from diapers . In the end , he 'll eat something green . " <p> Most children eat a wide variety of foods until they are around 2 , when they suddenly stop . The phase can last until the child is 4 or 5 . It 's an evolutionary response , researchers believe . Toddlers ' taste buds shut down at about the time they start walking , giving them more control over what they eat . " If we just went running out of the cave as little cave babies and stuck anything in our mouths , that would have been potentially very dangerous , " Dr. Cooke said . <p> A natural skepticism of new foods is a healthy part of a child 's development , said Ellyn Satter , a child nutrition expert whose books , including " Child of Mine : Feeding With Love and Good Sense " ( Bull Publishing , 2000 ) , have developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each child has a unique set of likes and dislikes that Ms. Satter believes are genetically determined . The only way children discover what they are is by putting food in their mouths and taking it out over and over again , she said . <p> " Of course , it 's hard when children are just so blase about food or refuse it , especially for parents who spend a lot of time thinking about it and preparing it , " she said . <p> The genetic link makes sense to Jennifer Useloff , whose son enjoys only variations on the same theme : bread and cheese , with some fruit and the occasional chicken nugget . His younger sister , Samara , is n't as picky but sometimes follows her brother 's lead . <p> Mrs. Useloff , 36 , was once a picky eater herself . Although she drank gallons of milk , she could n't abide raw fruits or vegetables . New foods with strange textures literally frightened her . <p> The aversion lasted until her 20s , when she worked to overcome her fears . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel guilty , " she said . " I worry that I 've done this to them . " <p> Even though food neophobia appears to be genetic , doctors say parents of picky eaters ca n't just surrender and boil another pot of pasta . <p> " We have to understand that biology is not destiny , " said Patricia Pliner , a social psychology professor at the University of Toronto . " This does n't necessarily mean there is nothing we can do about the environment . " <p> People who study children prone to flinging themselves on the floor at the mere mention of broccoli agree that calm , repeated exposure to new foods every day for between five days to two weeks is an effective way to overcome a child 's fears . ( Other strategies for getting children to eat are included in an accompanying article . ) <p> Of course , attempting to introduce the same food week after week can be a Sisyphean task . Some parents just give up . That is more or less what Jessica Seinfeld did . <p> Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of three young children , became fed up with trying to get her children to eat fruits and vegetables . The oldest , Sascha , who is 6 , is so picky she used to dictate what the rest of the family ate . <p> " It made cooking in my house impossible , " Mrs. Seinfeld said . " I was so miserable every night . I felt like a failure as a cook and a failure as a mother . " <p> So Mrs. Seinfeld took an end run around the problem and developed a method of feeding her children that is , essentially , based on lying . <p> Her new book , " Deceptively Delicious " ( Harper Collins ) , outlines a series of recipes based on fruit and vegetable purees that are blended into food in a way that she says children wo n't notice . Half a cup of butternut squash disappears into pasta coated with milk and margarine . Pancakes turn pink with beets . Avocado hides in chocolate pudding and spinach in brownies . <p> " My theory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all of this food tastes better , " she said . <p> And even though she admits to leaving a box of macaroni and cheese on the counter when she 's making the stealth vegetable version , she does n't think her children will mind when they discover that mom 's pulled a fast one . <p> " My kids now are really starting to get that this is a special way my mom knows how to cook , " she said . <p> Some experts do n't buy the method . <p> " It does n't strike me as the best strategy , " Dr. Pliner said . <p> There is the issue of being found out , at which point a child might not trust new foods the parents present . And hiding foods does n't help a child learn to appreciate new tastes , she said . <p> " What we want children to do is like a lot of different foods , " she said . " If squash is perfectly disguised , children are not learning anything . Well , they are learning something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If neither repeated introduction nor hiding the vegetables works , and as long as a pediatrician is keeping an eye on the child 's health , the experts suggest nothing more than patience . <p> " Unless it becomes a huge issue , it tends to be a little more fleeting than parents think , " said Harriet Worobey , director of the Nutritional Sciences Preschool at Rutgers University . " I know a year can seem like five to parents , but these food jags are normal .
