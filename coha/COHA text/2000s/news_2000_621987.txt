<p> City officials are investigating corruption allegations involving San Francisco Building Inspection Department staff  --  including an assertion that one inspector demanded money from a couple requesting a permit and that his high-ranking boss tried to cover up the incident . <p> Officials at City Attorney Louise Renne 's office declined to comment yesterday , but sources said the probe has been under way for several weeks . Building officials are also looking at other incidents , including alleged illegal construction at a former police station in the Bayview district that the same inspector did not halt . <p> At the Building Inspection Department  --  which enforces health and safety codes on all construction in San Francisco  --  officials refused to comment on the probe yesterday . <p> At the center of the investigation is a complaint lodged last year by 77-year-old Antonio Juanillo , a retired employee with the city attorney 's office , and his wife , Angela , over how the department handled the construction of a 5-foot-high retaining wall at their home on Montecito Avenue . It should have been attributed to Debra Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Juanillos said they did not initially ask for a permit for the work on their property near San Francisco City College , believing that they did not need one to fix a wall that had toppled over during a storm . <p> DEMAND FOR MONEY <p> When a neighbor complained to the city about the work , the Juanillos say , inspector Rudy Pada asked them to give him a check made out " pay to cash " for work by a draftsman and engineer before he would approve their permit . <p> They said that when they protested to James Hutchinson , deputy director of the department , he told them there was no harm done because the couple had been given their $500 check back and he falsely stated they had recanted their complaint . <p> Antonio Juanillo , who worked as a legal assistant for 14 years in the city attorney 's office before he retired in 1992 , said , " I was deeply hurt because I have never corrupted anyone or been corrupted in my whole life . " <p> Angela Juanillo , a 68-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department was dragging its feet unless we came across with money for Mr. Pada . " <p> Pada is a civil engineer and longtime employee of the Building Inspection Department . In recent months , he was transferred from his field job as a housing inspector to a desk position checking plans for code compliance . The department will not comment on his transfer <p> Pada 's work is also under examination in connection with a remodeling project of buildings at 1676 Newcomb Ave . that decades ago served as the Bayview police station . City records indicate that a four-unit complex was built there last year and that Pada , who approved only minor work on the site , did nothing when he saw alleged illegal construction . <p> The head of the department , Frank Chiu , has gone out to look at the project and is to report today to the Building Inspection Commission . <p> Peter Burns , spokesman for the department , said Chiu , Hutchinson and Pada all declined to comment . <p> " The director is doing a full and thorough investigation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from there it is wherever the investigation takes us , " Burns said . <p> Deputy City Attorney Marc Slavin , speaking for Renne 's office , said , " It 's our policy not to confirm or deny whether we are undertaking any investigation . We take claims brought to our office and pursue them vigorously , but we do not comment on any particular case . " <p> He said that the office does " look into allegations of official misconduct on behalf of the city 's departments and when it is warranted , we refer such cases to the district attorney 's office . " <p> District Attorney Terence Hallinan 's spokesman , Fred Gardner , said he could not comment on whether the office is investigating the matter . <p> Alfonso Fillon , president of the Building Inspection Commission and an appointee of Mayor Willie Brown , was unavailable yesterday . But Debra Walker , appointed recently to the panel by Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano , said she was disturbed that she had only recently learned of the investigation from department sources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest and hard working and will be as concerned about these allegations as I am , " she said . " The city needs to get to the bottom of this . " <p> CHARGES NOT WITHDRAWN <p> When the Juanillos complained to Pada 's bosses , they say , Hutchinson told them in an October 30 letter that they had not suffered because they had been given back their $500 check . The couple said he also alluded to an earlier meeting at which , he said , they had recanted their allegation . <p> The Juanillos wrote back denying they had withdrawn their charge and said that if Pada 's conduct was acceptable , " then something is very wrong in the upper levels of management in the city . " <p> In an interview , Antonio Juanillo said , " We wanted Jim Hutchinson to be fair and let the chips fall where they may with an investigation . But we suspected that Mr. Hutchinson was covering up . It made us think he was giving a bad employee a whitewash . " <p> The Juanillos have built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay going through the permit process until they return from a coming vacation . <p> The other controversy attracting attention that involves Pada is a remodeling project of the former police station in the Bayview district . According to city documents , inspections have identified the construction of four unapproved residential units on the property . <p> The property is owned by Nancy Jen , the wife of Jimmy Jen , a former city building plan checker who for more than a decade has worked as a powerful behind-the-scenes civil engineer helping his clients expedite their projects through the labyrinth of planning and inspection codes . <p> Jimmy Jen also owns Power Exchange , a sex club across the street from the Building Inspection Department . The club  --  which went through a long battle with the city before clearing up all its code violations  --  bills itself as the city 's " largest all-male sex multiplex . " <p> Neither of the Jens returned a call from The Chronicle . <p> When Rafael Torres-Gil , the department 's senior code enforcement officer , questioned the conduct of Jen , Hutchinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassigned to a plan-checking post last month , said Patricia Vaughey , president of the Planning Around Divisadero Street group , which represents 22 neighborhood and merchant organizations . <p> " What troubles me about this whole case is that normal citizens have to jump through hoops at the department and others seem to be able to do what they darn well please , " Vaughey said . <p> Torres-Gil declined to comment , but in a four-page department report that he helped write January 6 , he said four illegal residential units have been built on the property without permits and that Pada 's approval of two permits for the site " does not address compliance with the violations cited in this report . " <p> Another department report , written Monday by the man who took Torres-Gil 's job , Marvin Ruiz , was obtained by The Chronicle . The report notes four pages of violations on the Newcomb project and says two building permits were requested by Jen and signed off by Pada . " There is no record of required inspections , " Ruiz wrote . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torres-Gil that " all complaints have been cleared by Rudy Pada . " The contractor referred Torres-Gil to Hutchinson " to discuss this matter . " <p> In response to a Chronicle query , Ruiz declined to elaborate . <p> Chronicle research librarians Kathleen Rhodes and Johnny Miller contributed to this report . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : March 16 , 2000 <p> CORRECTION : A headline in yesterday 's Chronicle incorrectly attributed a quote regarding the city investigation into possible corruption in the Building Inspection Department .
