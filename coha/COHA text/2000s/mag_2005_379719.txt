PINTER 'S PROGRESS <P> Having written plays with cheery names like The Birthday Party and The Lover that are in fact the opposite of cheery , HAROLD PINTER , 75 , could be thought of as a bit of a downer . But there was nothing grim about his reaction to the news that he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature . The playwright told reporters he was " bowled over " by the $1.3 million award . He did n't mean it literally ; the wound on his head came from a recent fall . Here 's hoping we 'll finally get a Pinteresque award-acceptance speech . Nothing says elation like tense silence and nameless menace . <P> Q &A; ROSIE PEREZ <P> In New York City this month , Rosie Perez will act in a play that 's written and produced in 24 hours , to raise funds for the charity Working Playground . <P> Rosie , where have you been ? <P> In the theater . It made me fearless . Before I was , like , " Oh , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " and I thought it was because I had integrity . But now I realize it was fear . <P> Describe your preshow rituals . <P> I have to go to the bathroom , sit on the bowl and sing show tunes . <P> Twice you were discovered in nightclubs . Did you ever think how life would be different if you were a homebody ? <P> Every day . I would have been a marine biologist . But I still dance . In my home . And in underground clubs where you do n't have to dress up . I like to go in sneakers . <P> How has show business changed for Latin actors since you were in Do the Right Thing ? <P> They 're letting more of us in , but we 're really not allowed to be too ethnic . If we are being ethnic , it 's this idealized ethnicity being portrayed . <P> You just directed a documentary on the political relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rico . Did you include your arrest for protesting bombs on Vieques ? <P> Yup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you push a Puerto Rican against a wall . Then it 's hold up , it 's on . The Vieques protest personified that . I felt a part of things . <P> What was your old Fly Girl , Jennifer Lopez , like before she became J. Lo ? <P> She was a very , very ambitious girl when she was at In Living Color , and I think she got everything she wanted . <P> As a former choreographer , rate Britney Spears ' hip-hop dancing . <P> It 's a grave insult to hip-hop to say what Britney Spears does is hip-hop . You can learn steps , but you can not learn how to boogie . <P> RUSHING TO BE ONE OF THE GUYS <P> RUSH LIMBAUGH believes he belongs on a new list of men 's men even more than its current occupants Bono , Bill Clinton and George Clooney . The authors of the marketing book The Future of Men have coined a new buzz word for males who embrace their masculinity  --  " bersexuals "  --  and have compiled a list of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer things , confident , rather go out with the guys for dinner , does n't care what people think ? Man , that 's me , " Limbaugh said on his radio talk show . " This is what men were before feminism came along and neutered them ! " Somehow we suspect a real man 's man would n't have to raise his hand to join the club , but then the nation 's bersexuals are unavailable for comment on Limbaugh until the end of the baseball play-offs . <P> HIS AGENT WAS THE SECRETIVE ONE
