" I like change , " says Eastman Kodak CEO Daniel Carp . " I 'm one of those people that has to have change . " Good thing , because Kodak has had plenty of it . Carp is now well into the monumental task of dragging the iconic American company that invented consumer photography more than a century ago into the fast-moving , low-margin world of the digital era . He has little choice . As digital cameras have grown in popularity , Kodak 's profitable film business has gone into free fall . Not the first Kodak CEO to try to refocus the company on the digital future , Carp is clearly taking the biggest risks . He put his marker down 16 months ago when he announced that Kodak would cut dividends , slash investments in its film business  --  and milk its declining profits to fund $3 billion worth of acquisitions and investments crucial to the digital transformation . The market response was swift and brutal : Kodak 's stock price plunged 18% that day to a 20-year low . Carp followed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's 64,000-person work force by 2006 . Still , Wall Street analysts doubted that Kodak , with its legacy culture and reputedly ossified management , could match the pace set by its lean digital competitors . How could it generate sufficient profit from digital sales and cut costs fast enough to offset the precipitous decline of its primary source of profit ? <P> Today such skepticism on the Street , if far from gone , is tempered by pleasant surprise . A year after Carp launched the restructuring , Kodak has lined up a respectable portfolio of increasingly lucrative digital products and services . The company , based in Rochester , N.Y. , lost $12 million in the last quarter of 2004 , but that was largely because of restructuring costs . Meanwhile , its revenues actually climbed 3% , to $3.8 billion , in that period  --  the 16% decline in Kodak 's traditional film business offset by a 40% surge from its digital sales and services . Yet there remain ample reasons for doubt . For one thing , Carp has promised a pretty picture : $16 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , with more than half of that coming from its digital endeavors . He also says the company 's profit margin will drop from roughly 40% to 30%  --  and no further  --  and serve up $3 in earnings per share , vs. last year 's operational EPS of $2.62 . To longtime Kodak watchers , this optimism smacks of old times : Kodak trumpeted its digital aspirations nine years ago  --  and failed to deliver , unable to wean itself from traditional film businesses and their 60% margins . Is this just another false start ? " Everybody 's been skeptical , " says Carp , " except we 've put the numbers on the board . "
