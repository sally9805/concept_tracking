WHEN THE PHONE RINGS in a therapist 's office , prospective clients invariably ask the same questions : " Are you accepting new patients ? " ; " My problem is my ( **26;1088;TOOLONG ) . Do you work with this issue ? " ; and " Do you take my insurance ? " The first question determines the necessity of any further conversation . The second and related queries to establish the therapist 's personal style , approach , training , and background would seem of critical importance . The final one , however- " Do you take my insurance ? " - is the real deal-maker or - breaker in the delicate task of selecting a psychotherapist . Clients shopping for a therapist usually show little interest in whether I am a barely functioning hack or a highly respected professional . They do not seem to care if I am the kind of person whom they would not want rummaging about in their head , heart , and soul . What matters most is whether or not I accept insurance . I do not accept insurance for counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life issue , rather than a psychiatric emergency , there are almost no insurance plans that would cover the client 's claim . Health insurance as we know it is illness and accident insurance , meaning there must be a diagnosis . It is the absence of health that is billable . For counseling professionals , a billable problem would be a mental disorder . This is why I have elected not to apply to insurance panels and have the resultant small practice . There are three distinct ethical dilemmas in the use , or abuse , of mental disorder diagnoses and health insurance for life problems : * Diagnosis are generally subjective , sometimes political , and always inadequate to the task of describing the human condition . * The health insurance system was instituted to pool resources and risk in the high-stakes world of health care cost management . It is an abuse of this trust to manipulate diagnoses to save someone money on a personal issue . // * Clients are almost always unaware of how insurance companies operate . They seldom understand what the paperwork being filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend that the immediate benefit of insurance may be far outweighed by future damage to their quality of life . These are powerful reasons to shun insurance companies ' interference with the counseling profession , but a double bind markedly similar to codependence has arisen . Over the last two decades , as insurance companies became bigger and more powerful , they began to provide referrals for therapists who , in turn , sought to try to please those insurance companies . Professional practices evolved to meet the companies ' demands . These included the increasing use of diagnoses , different kinds of forms kept on file , and utilization of a specific billing format . At present , most therapists believe they could not possibly survive without the insurance companies . Where would they go , and what would they do ? Like a spouse whose soul and body have been badly battered , therapists feel frustrated , threatened , and trapped in an unhealthy alliance . A successful counseling practice without the insurance companies seems impossible , even as the demands become more intrusive and fees smaller . Diagnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwriters , insurance companies require a diagnosis in order to cover a mental disorder . These diagnoses are drawn from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ( DSM ) of the American Psychiatric Association , now in its fourth edition . The DSM comprises hundreds of diagnoses and subcategories , with criteria in the form of lists . It is important to note several things about the manual . The DSM began as a means of abbreviated communication between professionals for the puipose of case review , supervision , consulting , and related quality-control procedures . Rather than listing every specific complaint of a client , two professionals can exchange one or two words and , with knowledge of the DSM , have a working mutual understanding of the client 's general troubles . Thus , appropriate treatment alternatives can be discussed without weeding through unnecessary options . In supervision , while respecting the client 's anonymity , I can say I am preliminarily working with mild to moderate seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , but want to rule out dysthymia . My colleague will understand , with those few words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's low-level , persistent depressed mood , appetite changes , sleep pattern disruption , etc. are probably due to the seasonal changes in daylight , but I am not yet completely sure that this is not a case of lowlevel depression persistent over time . We can immediately explore the recommended interventions for SAD without wasting time discussing irrelevant treatment modalities . The criteria in the DSM are subjective and , except for a few neurological disorders , not measurable by scientific tests . Experts can not agree even on those well-known diagnoses that many therapists blithely , and illegally , may toss out to frustrated parents . Attention-deficit disorder ( ADD ) and **31;1116;TOOLONG disorder ( ADHD ) criteria , causes , and treatment were the subjects of the National Institutes of Health 's Consensus Forum in 1998 . The only consensus the leading professionals reached was that ADD/ADHD could not be clearly defined , reliably diagnosed , or predictably treated given the current research . Another issue with the diagnoses in the DSM is the politicization of the process . Disorders are decided upon , then withdrawn or changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a diagnosable sexual disorder well into the 1960s . It was subsequently removed from the DSM , and later replaced with a diagnosis for gay people who wished they were not gay . Homosexuality is not the only unusual citation for a mental disorder . Physiological problems caused by fluctuations in body chemistry , such as premenstrual syndrome , are categorized as diagnosable mental disorders , too . In the case of premenstrual syndrome , this is despite the fact that the symptoms of this " mental problem " are often very physically apparent . Blood hormone levels , for instance , are not typical signs of emotional distress . In an interesting contrast , the depressed mood accompanying another hormonal **28;1149;TOOLONG not led to it being categorized as a mental disorder . Paula Kaplan , a psychologist who was on a DSM panel , explored the political process of diagnostic development in her book , They Say You 're Crazy , which is a useful resource for anyone interested in knowing more about the machinations of guidelines for mental disorders . There have even been pressures in some quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may qualify one for protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act . Thus , many disorder diagnoses are as malleable as social pressures mandate . In addition to defined illnesses , the DSM has a section covering the problems that drive most people to counseling : relationships , bereavement , parenting , job difficulties , and other life events . These are described as " V-Codes " and are not billable under insurance . They may even include specifications advising the psychotherapist when to use a VCode and when to use a mental disorder diagnosis . For example , bereavement is just supposed to be used as a diagnosis for the first two months after a death . Any trained hospice professional will state that , until two or three months go by , the bereaved is still in too much shock for any real counseling . Only support is appropriate up until that time . According to the DSM , a long-married person should be pretty much back to normal two months after the death of a spouse . Otherwise , by American Psychiatric Association standards , he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professionals behind the development of the DSM than the mental state of grieving family and friends . Health insurance is a managed risk instrument . In exchange for a premium , I accept a range of services . I select the policy I want with the benefits I believe will be most useful for me . Among many choices , I may opt to have a higher copayment , but more flexibility in selecting my providers , or I may choose to pay for my own day-to-day costs completely and only access insurance for major medical expenses . These are my choices and determine the expectations I should have for the insurance company . The insurance company negotiates for bulk purchases of services , such as physician appointments , prescriptions , and blood tests . These providers apply to be on the " panel , " the group of providers who will be paid out of the insurance pool . In practical terms , then , the prospective client 's real question should be , " Does my insurance company take you ? " Fees are established , as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six counseling sessions or 10 . Being on the panel means accepting these set fees and the practice criteria . The insurance company also monitors bills submitted to be sure that no one is exploiting the system . If I am pooling my money with other people , I do not want my funds to go towards frivolous or unnecessary services . This is a drain on the pool and will result in higher insurance premiums for all members of it later . I do not want to pay for unnecessary visits for lonely people or massages disguised as a health treatment . I do not want to pay , as health care , for premarital counseling , blended family counseling , someone 's finding himself or herself , or any other personal need that may qualify as psychotherapy , but not as treatment of an injury or disease . If my insurance company , when presenting my options , offered limited coverage for life issues , I not only would sign up for it , but expeditiously apply to be a provider for those services . This would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . The trouble is that this is rarely , if ever , the case . More often , marital , family , or personal counseling is provided under the guise of a person 's treatment for some mental disorder or another . The ethical dilemma here can be a tenuous one . There may be a certain validity to a diagnosis , but it is not always the rationale for treatment . The diagnosis may be ancillary to the real problem or may be simply a stretch of the criteria . A person having marital troubles might legitimately feel depressed , but that depression is not the issue being directly treated , nor is it necessarily a physical ailment requiring coverage under the client 's physical health insurance plan . When I take my car to be repaired , the mechanic provides a specific diagnostic report and estimate , after careful investigation requiring considerable knowledge , experience , and skill . When my physician orders blood tests , he or she completes a lab requisition listing my diagnosis by code number and the tests correlating to that diagnosis . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , preliminarily diagnosing anemia . The provision of expert medical care requires careful observation , the application of knowledge , experience , curiosity , and then the selection of the appropriate scientific instruments and processes to verify the problem and affect a cure . Diagnostic codes Provision of mental health services can also include appropriate diagnostics . When research , informed application of it , agreed-upon standards , and compassion meet , good treatment and sound use of diagnostic categories can occur . When I worked in community mental health with severely disturbed clients , we used diagnostic codes to summarize their symptoms . The diagnosis of the paranoid type of schizophrenia would be utilized to characterize the experience of a client whose complaints included persistent , troubling , and very real-seeming ( but not real ) threats from the exterior world . The doctors , nurses , case managers , and residential staff could then work to develop a compassionate treatment plan and environment for this client 's needs . When I moved into a children and family-focused agency , we were treating passing behavior problems , blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their attending grownups . The diagnostic codes we used to communicate with the physicians , nurses , and case managers reflected the passing nature of the families ' dilemmas . The diagnostic codes were never intended to tell the whole story . Instead , they were shorthand among professionals . Psychotherapists in private practice frequently treat the " worried well " - basically healthy people who may be working through issues from their past , overhauling a relationship , or otherwise undergoing a period of personal growth , rather than experiencing a mental or emotional crisis . Similarly , they may see people who are struggling with a difficult event or a life passage , such as empty nests , bereavement , retirement , and marriage . Many people believe that , since their health insurance provides mental health benefits and that it is usual to see a mental health professional for such personal growth or life passage processes , these services should be covered under insurance . There are , in fact , a few insurance policies that cover life events . More often , though , clients search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game with them . The professional may clarify that " we will bill this under your/her/his/insurance , " and that identifies the patient . The holder of the coverage becomes the person who will be diagnosed with some mental disorder or another , perhaps just for the sake of saving some money in the short term . Here is where the buyer should beware . When your insurance form is sent in for billing , it includes an ICD code that tells your insurance company what your mental disorder is . ICD stands for International Classification of Diseases . Although there is not a disease called " turning 40 and the kids just left for college " or " we 're getting married , but our children hate each other , " people seeking assistance for such matters expect to use insurance . They almost never understand that insurance companies require that someone be diagnosed-officially and forever documented-as mentally disturbed . The ramifications of being diagnosed with an unwarranted mental disorder are many , and the long-term impact on people 's lives only will really be understood in the next several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print . Your insurance company may be able to share that information with other providers , employers , or researchers without your permission . Have you ever read a newspaper report that an accused criminal or politician was previously " treated for depression " ? This may come as news to the subject of the story , who accepted an antidepressant without comprehending that a diagnosis of depression was made to justify that prescription . Someday , a future employer , bureaucrat , or insurance agent may explain that your history of mental illness means you are unfit for a position , sportsman 's license , or favorable premium . What mental illness , you may wonder , only to discover that a preliminary misdiagnosis of depression on the way to a scientific diagnosis of Graves ' disease or short-term counseling for bereavement after the death of a family member is behind this history of alleged mental illness . This is not meant to create a vast undercurrent of paranoia about the misuse of diagnostic codes and confidential records . The clients of mental health professionals deserve to know , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for using health insurance . These issues-the nature of psychiatric diagnoses , the ethics of pooled risk within health insurance , and the future risks to uninformed clients posed by misuse of diagnoses-are powerful arguments against using , or accepting , typical health insurance policies for most counseling services . The dilemma is clear , as is the solution . Therapists can break out of this double bind , but only if willing to bear considerable financial losses . Referrals will drop , since few clients are willing to pay for services . This is not so radical a step as it may sound . Breaking free of the insurance double bind is simply a return to the way therapy was handled for most of its first 100 years . This independent , rather than codependent , posture has , within 20 years , become a revolutionary stance in mental health . Like leaving an addicted spouse or ceasing a futile attempt to appease an abusive employer , therapists should break free , meet with like-minded professionals , and return psychotherapy to the health of its youth .
