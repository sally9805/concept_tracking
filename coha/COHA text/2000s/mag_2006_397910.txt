We 're all staying at the Dubai Ritz <p> Why do the bills from the Pentagon for Halliburton 's subsidiary , KBR , always seem on the high side ? In the case of the company 's contract to restore oil services in Iraq , the explanation is not difficult to understand . Under the terms of the contract , writes Griff Witte of The Washington Post , " KBR earns its profit as a percentage of its costs . " The more the company inflates its costs , the greater its profit . It could be bad in Islamabad <p> Everyone is worried about Iran  --  and with good reason . But I worry even more about Pakistan . It already has the bomb  --  and not just one . Its ruler , Pervez Musharraf , is unpopular , seen by many to be a stooge of the United States . Islamic fundamentalism is growing . Yet when I talk to the experts , they assure me the Pakistani army is on our side and can control any revolt . That 's what they used to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is filthy " whistle blower <p> The American Foreign Service Association presents four annual awards for " constructive dissent . " This year there were only eight nominations for the awards , even though there are 10,000 foreign service officers . Last year , there were n't many more  --  17 , to be exact  --  and the year before there were only seven . <p> " The problem is not that there are n't people who deserve an award , but that people do n't want to be nominated , " explains AFSA president J. Anthony Holmes to Nicholas Kralev of The Washington Times . " They worry about negative repercussions . There is a feeling that questioning policy is extremely risky . " <p> This is definitely part of the problem . Discouraging dissent has been characteristic of the Bush administration . Indeed , on the same day that Kralev 's article appeared , Michael Gordon had another piece in The New York Times , dealing with the harm done by the suppression of dissent at Donald Rumsfeld 's Pentagon . <p> Although part of the problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucratic culture . The foreign service is a risk-averse culture , Barbara Bergen , coordinator of the awards , tells Kralev , who reports that " none of the nominations this year is related to a controversial foreign policy issue , such as Iraq , Iran , North Korea , or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . <p> " Two of those nominated voiced disagreement with visa procedures , one with a personnel issue involving a local employee of an embassy overseas , and one with a policy denying basic benefits to same-sex partners . " <p> I must say that in my experience , nothing stirs the passions of the foreign and civil services more than issues involving pay and benefits . Still , a lot of these people are very smart and do have dissenting opinions that they now share sotto voce only among friends . They should be encouraged to speak out . And they are not encouraged by the Bush gang . <p> " This administration does not tolerate dissent , " one foreign service officer tells Kralev . Condoleezza Rice " runs a tight ship , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you pay <p> The Earned Income Tax Credit promised to be a great boon for the working poor , the very people who most deserved a helping hand . Yet many of them do n't take advantage of it . The reason is that it is way too complicated . <p> " It 's so complex that the IRS publishes more than 50 pages of instructions , " writes Prof. Dorothy Brown of the Washington &; Lee University School of Law in a New York Times op-ed . " It is so complex that a Government Accountability Office report showed that taxpayers , tax return preparers , and IRS staff members regularly made mistakes while calculating and administering it . " <p> Congress has attempted to deal with the problem by pressing the IRS to audit more low-income returns . The result is that a disproportionate amount of the IRS audit effort has gone to taxpayers who , even squeezed to the maximum , can offer little more to the treasury when the obvious targets of the auditors should be rich cheats from whom the take could be substantial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for Congress to simplify the law and restore the credit to what Prof. Brown describes as its original purpose  --  " rewarding the poor for working , not penalizing them for being poor . " Can you hear me now ? <p> If you are driven round the bend by those automated phone responses offering you the choice of 7 , 8 , or 9 options  --  " listen carefully because our menu may have changed "  --  none of which fits your case , Clint Swett of the Sacramento Bee has some tips for you . First , press 0 . Sometimes this works right away ; occasionally , as when I call Amtrak , you have to wait for the first pitch to be spoken . Or say , " get human " or " get an agent " or " get a representative . " Or just wait , pretending you have an old-fashioned rotary phone . <p> But my favorite of Swett 's suggestions is , mumble . It seems that if the system ca n't understand your answer to its questions , it will connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorned <p> A jilted fianc has provided the key to the case against Jack Abramoff and ultimately the one against Tom DeLay . It seems that Michael Scanlon , DeLay 's top staff connection to Abramoff , had planned to marry another DeLay staff member , Emily Miller . After they got engaged , according to The Wall Street Journal , " Scanlon bought a $4.7 million oceanside mansion and guest house , formerly part of the DuPont Estate in Rehoboth Beach , Del . furnished it down to the monogrammed towels " and told his bride-to-be it would be theirs . Then , adds the Journal , with the wedding a few months away , he called it off and started dating a 24-year-old waitress . <p> Emily Miller was not delighted by this development . So when prosecutors sought her help in building a case against Scanlon , she said sure . Now Scanlon has been indicted and has agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors , as has another DeLay staffer , Tony Rudy . Maybe they 'll hire him at Abu Ghraib <p> The Journal 's story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudy once sent Scanlon . First revealed in The Breach by Peter Baker , the email urged a hard charge to impeach Bill Clinton and tells a lot about the philosophy of the Abramoff/DeLay crowd . <p> " This whole thing about not kicking someone when they are down is BS . Not only do you kick him , you kick him until he passes out  --  then beat him over the head with a baseball bat , then roll him up in an old rug , and throw him off the cliff into the pounding surf below . " Gossip craven <p> One wonders what the New York Post is going to do about the " Page Six " scandal . Will it insist that there be some sort of independent investigation of the allegations against Richard Johnson ? Did he or did he not have that deal with Ronald Perelman and Harvey Weinstein to have their coverage " finessed " ? It does seem clear that Perelman 's company gave a nice job to Johnson 's fiance . And were there tits on Page Six for the tat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Johnson in Mexico ? And what benefit , if any , did Mercedes-Benz derive from that first-class airfare and hotel stay at the Four Seasons for Johnson to go attend the Academy Awards in Los Angeles ? <p> I 'm confident that the Post will make sure that this investigation is pursued with the same vigor it urged Ken Starr to go after Bill Clinton . Let them live in cars <p> Speaking of the working poor 's need for a break , according to a study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition , reported by The New York Times : " Last year was the first year on record.that a full-time worker at a minimum wage could not afford a one-bedroom apartment anywhere in the country . " The minimum wage has n't been raised for nine years . During that time , average rents have risen more than 28 percent . The chilling effect of hypothetical fines <p> You may recall that after the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia , a number of news stories mentioned that the fines against coal companies for safety violations often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out that the problem is not confined to mine safety . It is true of federal fines generally . <p> " The government is owed more than $35 billion in fines and other payments from criminals and in civil cases , according to Justice Department figures , " report Martha Mendoza and Christopher Sullivan of the Associated Press . Another example : " When nuclear labs around the country were found to be exposing workers to radiation and breaking other safety rules , assessments totaling $2.5 million were quickly ordered . " The only problem was that the assessments were then waived . <p> This failure to collect fines also happens at the state level . " When a gasoline spill and explosion killed three young people in Washington state , officials announced a record penalty against a gas pipeline company : $3 million to send the message that such tragedies ' must never happen again . ' " What happened then ? The pipeline fine was reduced by 92 percent . The hardship of taramasalata <p> Government programs have a tendency to outlive their usefulness , to continue long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite examples of this comes from an article by James Bennet , the new editor of The Atlantic , written while he was working here in 1991 . It described how the Rural Electrification Agency lasted long after every farm in America had been wired by finding other worthy projects , such as helping out country clubs . <p> The most recent example I 've discovered was in an article about hardship pay for the State Department 's overseas posts . It describes how money to pay for posts in Iraq and Afghanistan has been found by eliminating hardship pay in Athens , Warsaw , Hong Kong , and Seoul , meaning that up until now , State Department employees at these posts have been pulling down the extra bucks . Athens was found suitable for the Olympics two years ago , Seoul 18 years ago . Warsaw has not been a hardship post for almost as long , and Hong Kong has not been one for at least 50 years . In English , please ? <p> Everyone tells me Michael Chertoff is a smart fellow , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up a nice lifetime job as a judge on a federal circuit court of appeals . Still , he talks in a way that makes alarm bells sound in my mind as I recall long dull meetings in the bureaucracy . He calls for a " properly risk-managed approach to critical infrastructure " and " an integrated , sensible , systems-based approach . " And according to Dana Milbank of The Washington Post , to whom I am indebted for these examples , he speaks of " the critical points of triangulation " and of " better information about the constituents of the supply chain . " At DHS , he aims for " internal integration into a unified command structure . " I have to say that I have never known anyone who talked this way who was also an effective leader . This headline brought to you by the oil industry <p> Do n't automatically assume a hybrid car will save gas . If it 's a big SUV or you use the car for long trips , the savings wo n't be significant , writes Jamie Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like corrections to conventional wisdom like this , but I do have a complaint about how the Times presented the piece . Its subhead : " If you want to save gas , do n't drive a hybrid . " That is not what the article says . Indeed , it makes clear that if your driving is predominantly around town , you will save gas and money with the Toyota Prius . No one wants job training  --  except the workers <p> Over one-third of male high school students  --  35 percent , to be exact  --  do not graduate , according to a recent study by the Manhattan Institute . This follows a recent cover article in Time about the deplorable number of high school dropouts . My son , who teaches at a high school in San Bernardino , Calif. , and who has for several years run a program to encourage students to go to college , thinks he knows the reason . " A lot of these kids do n't want to go to college , and you are n't going to persuade them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good vocational education program that they can see is going to train them for a real job they can get . " <p> Unfortunately , voc. ed. has been unfashionable for many years . Many articles are written about the value of a college education , but few about the need for job training in high school . The result is a large number of dropouts , a large percentage of whom are unemployed . <p> Vocational education has not just been out of fashion . Training for work as electricians , plumbers , and other well-paying construction jobs has been discouraged by the labor unions who do n't want competition . <p> Furthermore , high school faculties are dominated by teachers of college prep courses who want their subjects to dominate the curriculum and command the lion 's share of the school budget . It 's going to take a mighty effort to change this sad situation . But it 's good to know that at least one prominent politician , Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger of California , is actually trying to do something about the problem . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of DHS , you have to wonder who has been doing the hiring over there . One employee has been arrested for indecent exposure . He was the second-highest ranking investigator at U.S. Customs and he was actually in charge of an operation to catch sex offenders . Another , DHS 's deputy press secretary , was allegedly attempting to use the internet to seduce what he thought was a 14-year-old girl , who unfortunately for him turned out to be a detective in a Florida sheriff 's office . And do n't forget that female lawyer from DHS , who almost blew the government 's case against Zacarias Moussaoui by trying to coach witnesses after having been specifically instructed by a judge not to do so . So 9/11 was n't a total loss.at least his career was safe <p> Back to risk-averse bureaucrats for a moment . Another example comes from the recent trial of Zacarias Moussaoui . When the Minneapolis bureau of the FBI was trying desperately to get a search warrant to go through Moussaoui 's belongings , where they could have found evidence of the 9/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maltbie kept refusing to help . At the trial , one of the Minneapolis agents testified , according to The New York Times , that " Mr. Maltbie had told him he was reluctant to press for a warrant because doing so would be risking his career and ' he was not about to let that happen to him . ' " Lotto blot-to <p> " South Carolina officially started its state lottery yesterday , becoming the last state on the East Coast to add government-sponsored gambling , " reported the Associated Press recently . And The Wall Street Journal reports that state-sponsored slot machines are now in use in nine states : Delaware , Iowa , Maine , New York , Oregon , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , South Dakota , and West Virginia . Pennsylvania will soon join them , and other states are considering the move . <p> The Journal calls slots " one of the most popular and addictive forms of betting . " If they are addictive , why are states sponsoring them ? Because , observes Richard Leone , who was a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " free lunch . " They think they are avoiding unpopular taxes , but in truth , the revenue produced by lotteries and slots is a tax  --  only as Leone also observes , it is a tax " more regressive than any . " <p> Lottery tickets are purchased and slots are played largely by people of modest means . For a state to advertise its lottery and slots is enticing people to spend money many of them can not afford to lose . And , what may be worst of all , it lures potential addicts into becoming real ones . It takes a lot of Stairmasters to protect the country <p> Back to homeland security for a moment . Did you know that some of the DHS ' grants to fire departments are being used for physical-fitness programs ? " In Florida , the Plantation City Council recently voted to use its $28,000 for treadmills , stationary bikes , and training machines for police and firefighters , " reports Audrey Hudson of The Washington Times . " The Crawfordsville Fire Department in Indiana is using its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct firefighters on how to become fitness trainers . " Pardon us , Mr. Ford <p> Thirty years ago , Gerald Ford was rejected by the American public when he sought four more years in the White House after succeeding Richard Nixon in August 1974 . Yet , before he pardoned Richard Nixon a month later , Ford had seemed to be on one of the most notable presidential honeymoons in our history . His straightforward manner and Midwestern openness provided a welcome contrast to his predecessor 's convincing imitation of Richard III . Choosing as his vice president the moderate Nelson Rockefeller , the man Nixon had seen as his principal Republican rival , had only appeared to solidify the esteem in which Ford was held . Even the liberal Arthur Schlesinger Jr . expressed warm approval . Then came the pardon . <p> The reaction was swift and unforgiving . Ford 's approval ratings immediately dropped 22 percent . The nation 's leading newspaper , The New York Times , thundered its editorial condemnation of the pardon . Even the presidential press secretary , Jerry terHorst , resigned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 Days , Ford 's presidency never recovered . <p> Yet , looking back on it , the pardon has struck a good many of us as the right thing for Ford to have done . The country had already overdosed on Watergate . It had dominated the news for over a year . The desire for vengeance on the part of most Democrats and even some Republicans was palpable . Of course , Nixon had earned every bit of the hatred . But it seems to me now that we should have been satisfied to have forced Nixon 's resignation . Why heap more humiliation on him ? And why distract the country from dealing with important problems like the war in Vietnam and escalating inflation ? A Nixon trial would have dominated the news from the moment he was charged until he was sentenced . <p> Thus the pardon was not only merciful , but sensible . Ford did the right thing and the rest of us were wrong to condemn him . <p> By Charles Peters <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
