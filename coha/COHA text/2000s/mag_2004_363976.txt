The Bush re-election campaign apparently thought it was going " positive " with its first advertisement , highlighting the President 's post-9/11 leadership . But the reaction from some families of 9/11 victims has been decidedly negative and very public . " The idea that President Bush would rally support around his campaign using our loved ones in a way that is so shameful is hard for me to believe , " Rita Lasar , who lost a brother , told the Washington Post . " For the most part , " said another relative , Kelly Campbell , " 9/11 families are very sensitive to someone using the images of our loved one 's death for their own ends . " <P> Let us be clear about the commercials . There is nothing graphic . No bodies . No blood . No names . This is not the Passion of 9/11 , just iconographic images that we all remember , including the solemn bearing of a coffin and views of the devastation . <P> Is this off-limits ? Beyond the bounds of decency ? <P> The families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not own 9/11 . This was not a house fire . This was not a train wreck . This was an act of war . And war is a national event . <P> It is precisely because it was a national event that the families have been accorded such extraordinary support and attention  --  from the initial outpouring of generosity to the consecration of the ground zero space and establishment of a memorial to the billions of dollars of taxpayer money for their compensation . <P> The survivors of those who die in house fires do not get anything like this . The Oklahoma City survivors received no public compensation . Why ? Because while a house fire is tragedy and Oklahoma City was terrorism , 9/11 was war . And war , sadly , belongs to everyone . <P> The idea that because individual Americans died , 9/11  --  whether as image , event or political issue  --  is outside the public domain is absurd . By that logic , Franklin Roosevelt would have been prevented from invoking Pearl Harbor in his 1944 re-election campaign . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American people are not panicked easily , " he said in a White House radio address just five days before the election . " Pearl Harbor proved that " ) but visited Pearl in July 1944 , at the very kickoff of his campaign . <P> Sept. 11 was the most important event of our time , let alone of this presidential term . Sept. 11 , its aftermath and the response  --  the War on Terror , the Bush doctrine of going after states and not just terrorists , and the implementation of that doctrine in both Afghanistan and Iraq  --  are central to deciding the fitness of George W. Bush to continue in office . <P> The International Association of Fire Fighters expresses outrage that the Bush campaign used the image of firemen carrying a flag-draped stretcher out of the World Trade Center rubble . The charge is suspect not just because it comes from a union that endorsed John Kerry last year ; on the merits , it makes no sense . Would it be wrong for an antiwar candidate to show a photo of , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq ? Would it be wrong for a pro-war candidate to show , say , Saddam 's mass graves ?
