AN BROLLACH <p> Everything in the universe is older than it seems . Blame Einstein for that . We see what a thing was when the light left it , and that was long ago . Nothing in the night sky is contemporary , not to us , not to one another . Ancient stars exploded into ruin before their sparkle ever caught our eyes ; those glimpsed in glowing " nurseries " were crones before we witnessed their birth . Everything we marvel at is already gone . <p> Yet , light rays go out forever , so that everything grown old and decayed retains somewhere the appearance of its youth . The universe is full of ghosts . <p> But images are light , and light is energy , and energy is matter ; and matter is real . So image and reality are the same thing , after all . Blame Einstein for that , as well . <p> The Bar on Jehovah needs no other name , for it is the sole oasis on the entire planet . The Elders do not care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its patrons drop into the Black Hole of ancient myth . But chance has conspired to create and maintain this particular Eden . <p> The chance is that Jehovah sits upon a major interchange of Electric Avenue , that great slipstreamed superhighway that binds the stars . Had it been a small nexus , some bandit chief would have taken it . Had it been a large one , some government would have done so . But it is the Mother of All Nexi , so none dare touch it at all . A hundred hands desire it , and ninety- nine will prevent the one from taking it . Call that peace . <p> Consequently , it is the one Port in the not- so United League of the Periphery where a ship 's captain and crew can rest assured in their transient pleasures that cargo , ship , and selves are safe . The Bar is thus an Eden , of sorts . There , one may take the antidote to the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil , for a man in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a cash cow when they see one , even if the cow looks a lot like a serpent and money is the root of all evil . <p> She has come to Jehovah because , sooner or later , everyone does . The Spiral Arm is a haystack of considerable size and a particular man a needle surpassingly small , but Jehovah is the one place where such a search might succeed , because it is the one place where such a man might be found . <p> She is an ollamh , as the harper 's case slung across her back announces . She is lean and supple-a cat , and she moves with a cat 's assurance , not so much striding as gliding , although there is something of the strider in her , too . The Bartender watches her wend the pit of iniquity with something like approval , for no one carries a harp in quite that way who can not make it weep and laugh , and frighten . <p> As she crosses the room , she gathers the eyes of all those conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her direction . She has eyes of green , and that is dangerous ; for they are not the green of grass and gentle hillsides , but the hard , sharp glass- green of flint . Her hair is the red of flame , complementing the color of her eyes ; but her skin is dark gold , for the races of Old Earth have vanished into a score of others , and what one is has become , through science , a projection of what one would be . Yet there is something solitary about her . Her heart is a fortress untaken ; though from such a fortress who knows what might sortie ? <p> When she reaches the corner the men sitting there drag the table and their less mobile mates aside and make a place for her . She does not ask permission . None of her kind do . Minstrel and minnesinger ; skald , bard , and troubadour . They never ask , they simply appear-and sing for their supper . <p> She opens her harp case and it is a clairseach , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp of the old style . She plays the cruel metal strings with her nails , which is the only true way of playing . The truest songs have always a trace of pain in their singing . <p> In self- mockery , she plays an ancient tune , " A wand'ring minstrel , I , " to introduce herself and display the range of her music . When she sings of the spacefarers , the grim jingle of the Interstellar Cargo Company runs underneath the freewheeling melody : mockery in a minor key . When she sings of the Rift , the notes are empty and lost and the melody unremittingly dark . When she sings of Old Earth , there is unrelieved sorrow . When she sings of love-ah , but all her songs are songs of love , for a man may love many things and anything . He may love a woman , or a comrade . He may love his work or the place where he lives . He may love a good drink or a good journey . He might get lost-on the journey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is love without loss ? <p> Matters are different for women . They generally love one thing , which is why the love of a woman is like a laser while that of a man is like a flood . The one can sweep you away ; the other can burn you clean through . There is One Thing that the harper has loved and lost , and the memory of it aches in all her songs , even in the cheerful ones ; or especially in the cheerful ones . <p> For her set piece , she sings " Tristam and Iseult , " the cruelest of the songs of love , and with its ferocity she holds her listeners ' hearts in her hand . When she plucks out the strokes of war , their hearts gallop with the thundering strings . When she caresses the gentle tones of trysting , they yearn with the lovers in their bower . And when her fingers snap the sudden chords of betrayal , a shiver runs through them and they look at their own comrades through lowered lids . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this time , somehow , it will all end differently , and in the end she leaves them weeping . <p> Afterward , the Bartender directs her to a dark corner , where a man sits before a bowl of uiscebeatha . The bowl is empty-or not yet refilled , depending on the direction of one 's thoughts . He is one of those lost men , and it is in this very bowl that he has become lost . So he stares into it , hoping to find himself . Or at least some fragment of what he was . <p> He is a man of remnants and shadows . There is a forgotten look about him . His blouse is incompletely fastened ; his face concealed by the ill- lit alcove . It is a niche in the wall and he , a saint of sorts , and like a statue 'd saint , he makes no move when the ollamh sits across the table from him . <p> The harper says nothing . She waits . <p> After a time a man 's voice issues from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seduced Tristam from his duty . We thought he fell in love unwillingly . " <p> " It 's not love unless it is unwilling , " the harper answers . " Otherwise , why speak of ' falling ' ? " <p> " Your eyes remind us . . . " But of what he does n't say . It may be that he has forgotten . She might be one of those ghostly images that haunt the berms of Electric Avenue , crawling along at the laggard speed of light , only now arriving from some distant past . <p> The harper leans forward and says , with unwonted eagerness , " They tell me you know about the Dancer , that you knew those who were in it . " <p> Mockery from the shades . " Am I to be a seanachy , then ? A teller of tales ? " <p> " Perhaps , but there is a song in the tale somewhere , and I mean to find it . " <p> " Be careful what you look for . I think you sing too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . It all happened so long ago . I did n't think anyone knew . " <p> " Stories spread . Rumors trickle like winter snowmelt down a mountain 's face . " <p> The shadowed man thinks for a time . He looks into his bowl again , but if he intends another as the price of the story , he does not name that price and the harper again waits . <p> " I can only tell it as it was told to us , " the man says . " I can weave you a story , but who knows how true the threads may be ? " His fingers play idly with the bowl ; then he shoves it to one side and leans his forearms on the table . His face , emerging from the darkened alcove at last , is shrunken , as if he has been suctioned out and all that remains of him is skin and skull . His flesh is sallow , his cheeks hollow . His chin curls like a coat hook , and his mouth sags across the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are places on his skull , places with scars , where the hair will never grow back . His eyes dart ever sidewise , as if something wicked lurks just past the edge of his vision . " What can it matter now ? " he asks of ghosts and shadows . " They 've all died , or gone their ways . Who can the memories hurt ? " <p> The Shadows do not answer , yet . <p> Excerpted from The January Dancer by Michael Flynn <p> Copyright 2008 by Michael Flynn <p> Published in October 2008 by Tom Doherty Associates
