The OOD issues an order to the young helmsman . The helmsman turns the wood-spoked wheel to the right , and the boatswain picks up his silver whistle and alerts the crew . A seaman plots the change of course on a large paper chart with a straightedge and pencil , noting the time . Below , in sight of the captain , hundreds of crewmembers ready the ship 's weapons for a fight . Ah , the ritual and romance of the fighting ship in the Age of Sail , when the 100-gun man-of-war , one of the most complex machines ever devised , roamed the oceans of the world . It 's the romance that turned Patrick O'Brian 's 20 Aubrey/Maturin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes , will make this month 's Master and Commander , starring Russell Crowe , into a blockbuster . But the scene described above is actually standard operating procedure on the bridge of Nimitz-class U.S. Navy supercarriers today , carriers such as the recently commissioned U.S.S. Ronald Reagan , the Harry S. Truman and the Abraham Lincoln . Silver whistles , pencil and charts , the spoked wheel-all are used in today 's Navy , although , of course , a carrier also relies on instant messaging via encrypted satellite signals and , instead of powder-fired cannon shot , launches cruise missiles and smart-bomb-equipped F/A-18 Hornets . For all the enormous and obvious changes in ship design , materials , propulsion systems , weaponry , controls , navigation , communications and the like , the fundamental purpose of big warships has not changed much in the 200 years since Lord Nelson commanded the H.M.S. Victory , the Nimitz of its day : " forward presence " during peacetime-in the form of awesome machines whose mere appearance signals the will of empire-and overwhelming firepower during war . ( The ship in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself a marvel of compact complexity . ) At sea level , the fundamentals also endure . " Wind has n't changed . Waves have n't changed . The weather has n't changed , " says Capt . James " Hubs " Hubbard , who until last year was the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman 's " air boss , " the officer in charge of flight operations . Hubbard made the remark during a training cruise off the Virginia Capes before the ship 's deployment for duties in the months before the Iraq war . " We still have to take all those things into account during an operation . For instance , we wo n't launch our F-14s in a crosswind greater than 7 knots . " STRATEGY AND FIGHTING Nelson would have marveled at the military possibilities represented by carrier technology-cannons that fly , my Lord ! - but he would probably have regretted a key difference between his ship and ours . The supercarrier , too valuable to risk losing , and able to hurl its ordnance beyond the horizon , is made to stand away from battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire 's technology right into the thick of things . Engagement was often a ship-versus-ship slugfest . A big naval encounter involved what was called a " line of battle " : a fleet of 30 or more ships lined up bow to stern so they could concentrate their firepower in thunderous cannonball broadsides at an enemy fleet-preferably from ranges of 240 yards or less . The intent of these barrages of flying iron was to hole an enemy hull and sink the ship while sending showers of deadly wood splinters into the crew , or at least do enough damage to immobilize a ship for boarding , hand-to-hand fighting and capture . Today , the primary modern fighting maneuver of the carrier is to position itself for the launch and recovery of its F-14s and F/A-18s . " The ultimate thing we do , " says the Truman 's Capt . Michael Groothousen , " is put fused bombs on the target . " The dangerous , skilled , clockwork duty of hundreds of sailors is the maintenance , arming , launch and capture of the carrier 's aircraft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting is the one thing not directly seen except by a handful of pilots sent out to engage the enemy with their smart bombs and other devastating ordnance . The actual maneuvering of the ship , pointing it into prevailing winds , may sound relatively simple , but there are complicating factors . U.S. carriers operate as the centerpiece of a complex battle group that typically includes Aegis guided-missile cruisers and destroyers , conventional destroyers , a guided-missile frigate and attack submarines- " our ring of steel , " Groothousen calls it-plus a support vessel that carries ammunition , fuel and supplies . All these must be able to stay near the carrier , without interference or collision . Sea space may be limited , if there are islands or shoals in the way . Winds may shift , and currents and tides may impede the ship . A carrier may steam upwind launching its heavily armed jets , then turn and go downwind , then turn again upwind to receive its returning aircraft , which may be low on fuel and need to land promptly . Ships have to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in Nelson 's time . " One of the great difficulties of operating a man-of-war in the Age of Sail was just communicating , " says John Hattendorf , a professor of maritime history at the Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island , " both between ships and onboard a ship . For routine commands , like changing sails-which involved a great many men-the boatswain piped a set of precise orders . And the captain might use a megaphone . " But imagine the situation in combat , as the cannons roared , firing raggedly after the first united salvo , with the wind and sea sometimes roaring too , and the smoke-especially on the gun decks-making it nearly impossible to see . " Once in battle , " Hattendorf says , " they might signal from ship to ship with flags that had a particular meaning , like ' Enemy fleet in sight ' or ' Engage closely . ' And sometimes at night they used lanterns , though night battles were rare . Occasionally , the fleet would have a frigate stand away from the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet . " Onboard ship , during a battle , the captain used runners-often boys known as " powder monkeys " - to communicate with , say , gun crews . Today , boatswains still use their pipes-sounding over a ship-wide PA system-to alert the carrier crew to a major announcement , but a PA system does not suffice for most of the onboard communicating . There 's a " ship 's telegraph " between the bridge and the engineers . Between ships in the battle group and up and down the chain of command , from the admiral in charge of a battle group through the commander of the Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet and all the way up to the Pentagon and the White House , communications are encrypted . " We actually do the bulk of our communicating by e-mail , " says Lt. Comdr . Brenda Malone of the Truman . " For unclassified stuff , we use Microsoft Outlook . Of course , there are also secure networks that use other programs . And between ships we do some video teleconferencing , both secure and unclassified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The launch of the Reagan this year represented , the Navy says , the most significant technological leap forward for the Nimitz-class carriers since the Nimitz itself , with much more emphasis on the digital display and distribution of information . Digital instruments in the bridge produce a more intuitive " glass bridge " modeled after the so-called glass cockpits in modern aircraft , and there are touchscreens instead of old-style gauges and dials . Communication data flows through a fiberoptic system . Yet there is one place on a carrier where the roar and near chaos of a man-of-war persists : the flight deck during battle . Military jets are unmuffled and often operate on the deck at full throttle , producing a thunder above which no shout can be heard . Pilots and flight deck crew , including the catapult crew-the " shooters " - communicate via hand signals . A missed signal ( " jet blast reflector up , " " turn right , " " fold wings , " " go " ) can kill , just as miscommunication between crewmembers manning a recoiling cannon could dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAPTAIN AND CREW A man-of-war captain in the late 18th and early 19th centuries had to know all about the actions and interactions of the ocean and the weather-indeed , everything that could help or hinder the progress of his ship , moment by moment , season by season , anywhere in the world ( a British squadron under Lord Nelson shadowed a hostile French fleet in 1805 from the Mediterranean across the Atlantic to the West Indies and back , navigating as usual with a chart , a lead line , sextant , chronometer , compass ) . Quick , accurate mathematical calculation was critical , Hattendorf says , and " the captain 's mind was his computer . " Because ships moved at the mercy of the wind , a fickle power source at best , the captain needed a deep understanding of how each one of some three dozen sails , from the flying jib to the mizzen topgallant sail , could affect movement-and how long it would take the topmen to scramble high into the rigging to reef a sail . Today , a Nimitz-class carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose operation a captain spends many months at the Navy 's Nuclear Power School studying , are equipped to produce 20 years ' worth of electricity . In addition to possessing sailing and navigation chops , every carrier 's commanding officer is required to be an accomplished aviator . Captain Groothousen , for example , who got his wings in 1976 , first flew A-7E Corsairs aboard America and Independence , then flew F/A-18 Hornets , became a Hornet instructor pilot , and finally commanded a Hornet squadron before assuming command of his first ship , the U.S.S. Shreveport , an amphibious-assault transport . As to the crew , a 100-gunner of the Royal Navy carried about 820 men , comprising experienced officers and veteran seamen-some of them " impressed , " essentially kidnapped-as well as " landsmen , " landlubbers who did n't know a tiller from a touchhole , and about 150 fighting marines . A Nimitz-class carrier operates with a crew of more than 3,200 trained and specialized young men and women , enlisted and officers . An eight-squadron air wing adds another 2,500 people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of a carrier crewmember is under 20 . During routine operations , these sailors work relentlessly , 14 to 16 hours a day ; in combat , far more . The nation 's most impressive symbols of military power are run by thousands of sleep-deprived , highly disciplined sailors , many of them teenagers . THE WEAPONS Ships of the line , from 100-gunners , known as First Rates , to 78-gun Third Rates , carried a roster of cannon ranging from 32-pounders down to 12-pounders ( named for the weight of the ball fired by black powder ) . With a range of over a mile , these were massive weapons , but they were not very accurate , hence the need for broadsides . " The guns could n't really move from side to side , " says Hattendorf . And they could only be elevated about 10 degrees and only by moving a wooden wedge called a quoin under the breech . " So moving the guns meant moving the ship . Aiming was essentially steering . " In addition to the plain cast-iron ball , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls for antipersonnel use at close range ) and chain or bar shot ( two balls linked by a short chain or a pair of sliding bars that would whirl in flight , the better to tear up the enemy 's sails and rigging ) . Whatever the ammunition , even a superbly drilled gun crew could manage a rate of fire of only one round every 2 minutes . Marines , fighting from the deck or in the rigging , also hurled grenades , fired muskets , and employed pikes and cutlasses . The array of offensive weapons on a Nimitz-class carrier reads like a list of all the varieties of hellfire . The F-14 Tomcats are armed with up to 13,000 pounds of AIM-54 Phoenix missiles , AIM-7 Sparrow missiles , AIM-9 Side-winder missiles , " air-to-ground ordnance " ( bombs ) and a M61A1/A2 Vulcan 20-mm cannon . The F/A-18 Hornets can carry most of the above , along with AIM-120 AMRAAM , Harpoon , Harm , SLAM , SLAM-ER and Walleye missiles , plus general-purpose bombs , mines and rockets . Antisubmarine and other offensive missions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harpoon , AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-84 SLAM missiles , plus torpedoes , mines , rockets and bombs . The SH-60 Seahawk helicopters can carry three Mark 46 or Mark 50 torpedoes , or AGM-119 Penguin or AGM-114 Hellfire missiles . And all this firepower can get off the boat in a real hurry : When the flight deck is in full " cyclic " mode , it launches a combat aircraft every 20 seconds . The key to this speed is the muscle of four C-13 Mod 2 steam-powered catapults , which , with 450 pounds per square inch of steam pressure , can help accelerate a fully loaded fighter to 165 mph in 3 seconds . This much Navy treasure needs protecting . Apart from its own air wing and its escort ships , a Nimitz-class carrier 's defensive weapons include three NATO Sea Sparrow short-range surface-to-air missile launchers ; four six-barrel 20-mm rapid-fire Phalanx Close-In Weapons Systems ( CIWS ) mounts , with Gatling guns ; and something called the " 32 " electronic warfare system that includes among its assets a wide-band radar warning receiver to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For all that , nothing as big as an aircraft carrier is invulnerable , and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in October 2000 in Yemen revealed that ships , like buildings , can take a direct hit from terrorists . Carriers now enforce more assiduously an air-and-sea " bubble , " or perimeter within which no craft can approach without challenge . " One of the tough decisions I make is when you have an in-bound and we do n't have a good ID on him , " says Groothousen . " Let 's say I have a small boat heading right for us-we 've warned him over the radio , we 've told him , ' Turn away , ' and he refuses to turn away . I 'm probably going to have to tell someone to engage him , at least shoot across the bow once or twice . And if he does n't turn away , take him out . And it 's the same thing with airplanes in the Persian Gulf . " In battle , though , U.S. carriers are almost invulnerable today-at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taliban . It is as if Nelson had sailed into Trafalgar against rowboats rather than the 33 ships and 2,600-plus guns of the French and Spanish fleets . For the 21st-century American carrier , there probably will be no Trafalgar-like test . The job is to sit back and hurl the flying cannons beyond the horizon . Michael W. Robbins , a freelance writer , has been published in Mother Jones and the Washington Post Magazine . TACTICAL MANEUVERS RAKING THE LINE Fighting ships moved in single file . By approaching at an angle ( 1 ) , a ship could dodge the brunt of the enemy blow , then fire as it passed . After delivering a hit to the leader 's stern ( 2 ) , it closed with a crippling broadside strike ( 3 ) . INTO THE WIND To deploy aircraft effectively along one of four takeoff trajectories , a carrier must face into the wind-the box pattern maximizes this exposure . The S-3B Viking support aircraft circles overhead , ready to refuel jets returning from missions . THE CONTROLLED CHAOS OF BATTLE In the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little 14-gun sloop , the Sophie , goes into full-broadside battle with the Spanish xebec-frigate Cacafuego . The Sophie is smaller than the ship used in the Russell Crowe film ( Crowe as Aubrey seen at left , bellowing ) , and a pipsqueak beside a mighty first-class three-decker . But the vivid elements of close battle are similar . " And all this time the Spaniards fired on and on , irregularly , spasmodically , but never stopping . The Sophie 's maintop had been hit again and again , and now it was coming to pieces-great lumps of timber falling down on deck , stanchions , hammocks . Her foresail yard was held only by its chains . Rigging hung in every direction and the sails had innumerable holes : burning wad was flying aboard all the time and the unengaged starboard crews were running to and fro with their fire-buckets . Yet within its confusion the Sophie 's deck showed a beautiful pattern of movement-the powder passing up from the magazine and the shot , the gun-crews with their steady heave-crash-heave , a wounded man , a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , every man intent , threading the dense smoke-no collisions , no jostling , almost no orders at all . " * 1ages 330 and 331 , WW Norton paperback edition of Master and Commander , by Patrick O'Brian . COMMUNICATIONS DUTY To coordinate the action of a 3-mile-long line of 27 ships , Nelson relied on signal flags . There were 10 flags in all , each representing a number from 1 to 10 . Different numerical combinations of one to three flags corresponded to words or individual letters . The sequence below , raised one group at a time under the direction of the signal officer , initiated the Battle of Trafalgar . It took only 4 minutes to transmit and was reportedly met with great cheers . THE CARRIER GOES DIGITAL For the new Reagan , carrier communications and electronics were completely overhauled . Fiber optics replaced heavy copper wiring , saving space and boosting data management capabilities . Forget signal flags : There are 1,400 telephones onboard , as well as a local area network and a satellite link to the Navy network that allows homesick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson could talk to his fleet .
