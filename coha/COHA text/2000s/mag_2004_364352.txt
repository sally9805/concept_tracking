Being the Midas of global outsourcing might not make Azim Premji popular in the U.S. , but back home in India he 's a role model . The story of how the Stanford-educated Premji transformed Wipro , his family 's vegetable-oil business , into one of the world 's most important outsourcing companies ( total employees : 27,200 ) is already part of Indian business folklore . A growing number of U.S. and European firms rely on the Bangalore-based Wipro to handle their software needs , keep their databases and computer networks up and running , and answer calls from customers . That has made Premji , 58 , Wipro 's chairman and principal shareholder , India 's richest man ( he 's worth an estimated $6.7 billion ) . Yet Premji 's influence comes as much from his iconoclastic personality as from his sheer wealth . He is revered by businesspeople in India for insisting that Wipro will not pay bribes  --  a common hazard of doing business there . <P> Premji is a new kind of Indian plutocrat . He flies economy class and seems happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up to promote primary education . And he defends India 's outsourcing industry : Wipro and its peers help U.S. firms grow by keeping their costs low and raising their productivity , says Premji . " And if American companies do n't grow , " he points out , " they do n't create jobs . "  --  By Aravind Adiga
