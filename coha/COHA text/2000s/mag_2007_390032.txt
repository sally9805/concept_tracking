Headnote The Soviet union was a puzzle . Al Qaeda is a myster . Why we need to know the difference THERE 'S A REASON millions of people try to solve crossword puzzles each day . Amid the well-ordered combat between a puzzler 's mind and the blank boxes waiting to be filled , there is satisfaction along with frustration . Even when you ca n't find the right answer , you know it exists . Puzzles can be solved ; they have answers . But a mystery offers no such comfort . It poses a question that has no definitive answer because the answer is contingent ; it depends on a future interaction of many factors , known and unknown . A mystery can not be answered ; it can only be framed , by identifying the critical factors and applying some sense of how they have interacted in the past and might interact in the future . A mystery is an attempt to define ambiguities . Puzzles may be more satisfying , but the world increasingly offers us mysteries . Treating them as puzzles is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as mysteries may make us more comfortable with the uncertainties of our age . During the cold war , much of the job of U.S. intelligence was puzzle-solving-seeking answers to questions that had answers , even it we did n't know them . How many missiles did the Soviet Union have ? Where were they located ? How tar could they travel ? How accurate were they ? It made sense to approach the military strength of the Soviet Union as a puzzle-the sum of its units and weapons , and their quality . But the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of terrorism changed all that . Those events upended U.S. intelligence , to the point that its major challenge now is to frame mysteries , as I learned as vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council , managing the process for producing National Intelligence Estimates . To analysts in the Pentagon , for instance , terrorists present the ultimate asymmetric threat . But the nature of the threat is a mystery , not a puzzle . Terrorists shape themselves to our vulnerabilities , to the seams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . The 9/11 hijackers , For instance , did not come to their plan of attack because they were aviation butts . They came to it because they had identitied gaps in our aviation defenses . Whether Saddam Hussein 's Iraq had nuclear or chemical weapons seemed a quintessential puzzle , and U.S. intelligence treated it that way . And got it wrong . But suppose the issue of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction had been treated not as a puzzle but as a mystery . That might have turned the exercise away from technical details and toward Saddam 's thinking . It might have raised the question : Could Saddam be more afraid ot his local enemies than he is of the United States ? Could that lead him to boast that he had weapons he really did n't have ? PUZZLE-SOLVING is frustrated by a lack of information . Given Washington 's need to find out how many warheads Moscow 's missiles carried , the United States spent billions ot dollars on satellites and other data-collection systems . But puzzles are relatively stable . If a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next . By contrast , mysteries often grow out of too much intormation . Until the 9/11 hijackers actually boarded their airplanes , their plan was a mystery , the clues to which were buried in too much " noise " - too many threat scenarios . So warnings trom I IiI agents in Minneapolis and Phoenix went unexplored . The hijackers were able to hide in plain sight . After the attacks , they became a puzzle : it was easy to pick up their trail . Solving puzzles is useful for detection . But framing mysteries is necessary for prevention . That 's one reason the FBI embarked on a change ot mission after 9/11 , from almost pure law enforcement to intelligence - trom solving puzzles to training mysteries . That change in mission requires an enormous change in organizational culture . For the puzzles of law enforcement , the measures of effectiveness are pretty clear-you can count the suspects collared and bad guys convicted . Terrorists , however , may commit but one crime , and by the time they do , it is too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why , rhetoric aside , counterterrorism was not a marquee FBI mission before 9/11 . For the mysteries of intelligence , measures of effectiveness are elusive . The goal of prevention is . . . nothing - an absence of attacks . But if no major terrorist attack occurs , does that represent the effectiveness ot prevention , simple good luck or the fact that the threat was overstated in the first place ? That 's one uncertainty we 'll have to learn to live with . There are others that framing mysteries can help us understand . NO MATTER HOW MUCH patients may seek the clarity of a puzzle , heahhcare , too , is largely a mystery . The goal of medicine , like that of counterterrorism , is an absence-of illness and disease . Achieving that goal depends on many different factors . Behavior matters , but only in some complicated interaction with propensity ; what is lethal obesity for one person is only a nuisance for another . Tests are imperfect predictors of illness , and treatments interact or have side effects . While few doctors would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be called Bayesian mystery framing . Bayes ' theorem is a statistical technique for adjusting subjective probabilities in light of new , but inconclusive , evidence . Doctors base an initial assessment of a patient 's health on propensity , as revealed by his or her medical history , and on diagnosis , determined through an examination . If the doctor 's initial assessment is of a high probability of disease , he or she orders more tests , which in turn refine that probability . For chronic concerns , such as high blood pressure leading to heart disease , the initial assessment leads to a decision about whether and how to treat , followed by subsequent tests to see if the original probability of problems can be revised downward . Most discussions about energy , as well , treat it as a puzzle : so many million barrels of proven reserves in country X , production to " peak " in country Y at a particular date and so on . From a geological point of view , the puzzle perspective makes sense : any individual drill hole or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystery , not a puzzle . How much oil a given well can produce is not the same as how much oil is there : whether it makes sense to use secondary or tertiary recovery methods after primary methods no longer suffice depends on price . And beyond a single well , the factors multiply . How fast will the global economy grow ? What new energy discoveries will be made ? Which alternative sources will come on line at what price ? In a recent issue of the New Torker , writer Malcolm Gladwell made a fascinating observation about the Enron scandal . He noted that law-enforcement investigators and , later , prosecutors treated the case against former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling as a puzzle : Enron either lied or dissembled about its finances ; either way , the public received too little information . But a year before the scandal broke , Gladwell also noted , several financial analysts treated Enron as a mystery . Parsing the company 's voluminous financial statements and quarterly findings , they realized that its vaunted profits- it claimed $111 billion in revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gains had not yet been realized , and depended on events that had not yet occurred . The company 's actual cash flow was virtually nil . The analysts pursued the matter with Enron , and the company flew its accounting team to Dallas for a meeting . For the mystery-framers , the challenge was not too little information , but too much noise . A summary of a single set of Enron 's complicated financial deals would have come to over a hundred thousand dense pages . Ultimately , the mystery ended calamitously , as Enron 's profit scenario failed to materialize , and the company collapsed . At that point , Enron became a puzzle , and the prosecutors ' approach to solving it worked . After Skilling was convicted ot fraud , he was sentenced to 24 years in prison , one ot the most severe prison sentences ever given for a white-collar crime . You might say that the puzzlesolvers succeeded , in that criminality was punished . Or you might conclude that the mystery-framers failed , in that the crime was not prevented .
