Chapter One Glenelg , the Scottish Highlands , April 14 , 1380 Where is Sir Hugo ? " nineteen-year-old Lady Sorcha Macleod demanded impatiently . She cradled a profusion of flowers in her arms as she gazed down the steep hill at the sparkling water of the Sound of Sleat , the deep sea-lane flowing between Glenelg , on the mainland , and the Isle of Skye . Her younger sister , Lady Sidony , bending to pick some yellow celandine for their collection , said over her shoulder , " You can not know that Sir Hugo even received your message . The messengers have not all returned . And , even if he did , you can not know he will come for her or come in a boat if he does . He could easily ride from Lothian or come from somewhere else . He may even be in Caithness . " " Faith , Sidony , I do n't care how the man arrives , just so he does , " Sorcha said impatiently . " If he does not show his face soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too bad the Lord of the Isles had to die when he did , " Sidony said as she arose and added her flowers to Sorcha 's . " Adela ought to be having as merry a wedding as everyone else has , but I fear that hers will be dreadfully dull . I still do not understand why Father agreed to hold the ceremony here instead of at Chalamine . The feast will takeplace at the castle , after all , and everyone else was married there . " " Not everyone , " Sorcha reminded her . " Isobel married at Duart Castle . " " Yes , but Cristina , Maura , and Kate were all married at home . I hope you and I will be , too-if Father ever finds anyone who wants to marry us , " she added . " I do n't want someone Father chooses , " Sorcha said , grimacing . " At least Adela has a sunny day , and the wee kirk of Glenelg is a pretty site . Lord Pompous insisted that she marry him here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chalamine . And that settled the matter , of course , since Lord Pompous will be her husband unless Sir Hugo arrives in time to put a stop to this wedding . " " I do not know why you are so sure he 'd want to , " Sidony said , pushing a stray strand of her fair hair out of her face . As children , the two of them had looked enough alike to be twins with their fine , silky soft , white-blond curls and light-blue eyes . But although Sidony 's waist-long hair retained its original color , silky fineness , and soft waves , Sorcha 's had darkened to amber-gold and retained only its curls . To her chagrin , in the frequent Highland mist and rain , they tended to frizz . Their eyes were still a matching light-blue color . But Sorcha 's looked gray in certain light , and a black line rimmed each of her irises . Semiconsciously mirroring her sister 's gesture , she shifted her floral burden to one arm to tuck an errant curl under her coif . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song about sending for him that nearly everyone expects him now . But Adela seems content enough with this wedding . " " Faugh , " Sorcha retorted rudely , abandoning her hair . " Adela would marry anyone who 'd have her . She wants to be quit of managing Father 's household and us , especially now that he is to marry Lord Pompous 's cousin , Lady Clendenen . But Sir Hugo holds Adela 's heart , I 'm sure . And I think he cares deeply for her , too . " " But they 've met only twice , " Sidony protested . " Once here in Glen Mer last summer , and then shortly after that at Orkney . " " Aye , well , it only takes once , " Sorcha said with more assurance than one might expect from a young woman who had never met a man she wanted to marry , or received an offer . " Adela talked of him for weeks after Prince Henry 's installation . " " Do you think so ? " Sidony asked doubtfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second time she emptied a basin of holy water over his head . " Still watching the Sound , Sorcha exclaimed , " Three boats are coming ! Oh , but how vexing ! If I do n't mistake that banner , ' t is only Lord Pompous . " " You should not call him that , " Sidony chided gently . " Pooh , " Sorcha said . " Ardelve is as pompous a man as walks and far too old for Adela . Why , he must be near Father 's age , whilst she is but four-and-twenty . " " Nearly five-and-twenty , " Sidony said . " Even so , Sir Hugo is of a much more suitable age to marry her . She is sacrificing herself , just to get away from Chalamine . " " Perhaps , but Father said he had despaired of ever seeing her marry , " Sidony said . With a rueful smile , she added , " You and I are old for wedding , come to that . Not that I am sure I 'd want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are never sure of anything , " Sorcha said , patting her shoulder . " Depend on it , if you do marry , ' twill be because Father commands it . If you had to make up your mind , the hopeful bridegroom would die of old age first . " " That is his lordship , " Sidony said , too familiar with Sorcha 's opinion of her indecisive nature to take offense . " And I see the wedding party coming . Do you not think we 'd better go meet them if Adela is to carry the flowers we 've gathered ? " " Aye , sure , especially since we already have enough for her chaplet , too , " Sorcha said as they hurried to greet the riders . * * * As Lady Adela Macleod 's wedding party forded the bubbling burn near the base of the hill and continued up toward the kirk , she felt almost wholly at peace . For the first time in too many years she was responsible for no one and nothing . She just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say what the priest , a Macleod cousin of her father 's from Lewis , told her to say . The feeling was heady , and as she rode beside her father , Macleod of Glenelg , the silence that enveloped them was pleasant . Except for the tiny tickle at the back of her mind , all was well . The small cluster of smiling villagers and friends near the kirk steps stood quietly , waiting . Even her usually talkative aunt , Lady Euphemia Macleod , remained unnaturally silent . She rode just behind them in her boxy , sheepskin-lined sidesaddle between two gillies mounted on ponies as placid as her own . At fifty , the whip-slim Lady Euphemia disliked riding and focused all her energy on keeping the boat-on-waves motion of her cumbersome saddle from tossing her to the ground . The rest of the party included Adela 's older sister Maura , Maura 's husband and three children , and a few of the castle servants . Others had remained behind to prepare the wedding feast . Guests were few only because MacDonald , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the Highlands and Isles was preparing for the investiture in two days ' time of his successor . Adela did not mind the small ceremony , though . She 'd have been happy to marry by simple declaration , but women of her ilk rarely married in such a hasty , scrambling way . She rode as her aunt did , sitting sideways , but with nothing between her and her favorite bay gelding except a dark-blue velvet caparison to protect her skirts . One of her younger sisters , Kate , had embroidered the caparison with branches of Macleod of Glenelg 's green juniper and had sent it especially for the occasion . Like all six of her sisters , Adela preferred to ride astride . But she had known better than to suggest doing so in the new sky-blue silk gown her father had given her for her wedding . Blue to keep her true , he had said , citing from an ancient rhyme . He had refused to allow her favorite color due to his strong belief that if she wore pink , her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching from the open , grassy hilltop near the kirk and realized how glad she was that she had sent them ahead to gather blooms for her bouquet and chaplet . She had done it not only because the hilltop produced myriad wildflowers in an otherwise heavily forested area , but also because she had wanted as little fuss as possible while she dressed for her wedding . Her ever-superstitious father disliked the fact that she had not gathered her own flowers , a task he believed would bring her good luck . When he noted the day 's sunshine , his strictures had ended , but no sooner did he clap eyes on Sorcha and Sidony than he sighed and said , " I hope ye mean to be a good wife to Ardelve , lass . " " I do , sir , " Adela said . " I have always done my duty . " " Aye , ' t is true , but I 'd feel better if ye 'd done all ye could to bring good fortune on yourself today . " " The day is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swift , oblique glance his way , she added gently , " Yesterday was not so beautiful , sir . " " ' T is true , " he agreed . " Cursed wi ' a gey thick mist , it were , from dawn 's light till suppertime . So it be nobbut providential that when Ardelve and I arranged the settlements , I persuaded him to put off the ceremony for the one day . " " Why do you believe Friday is such a bad day to wed ? " she asked . " Aunt Euphemia said many prefer it , because of its being dedicated to the Norse goddess of love . She said the notion that Friday is unlucky arose only during this past century . " " Aye , well , Euphemia doesna ken everything , " Macleod said . " ' T was kind o ' her to journey here from Lochbuie for your wedding , but everyone kens that when a Friday falls on the thirteenth o ' the month , it does bring mortal bad luck . Bless me , lass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any o ' me daughters marry on such a bleak day ! " " But I do n't think everyone does know , " Adela persisted . " Ardelve did not . At least ... " She fell silent , knowing he would not want to recall what Ardelve had said . " Aye , I ken fine that the man thinks changing the day were nobbut a frippery notion o ' mine , " Macleod said , unabashed . " Still , he agreed , and as ye see , the Almighty ha ' blessed the day I picked wi ' sunshine . " Adela nodded , and when he fell silent , she made no attempt to continue the conversation . The only sounds until they reached the kirkyard were soft thuds of hooves on the dirt path , cries of seabirds soaring overhead , and scattered twitters and chatters from nearby woodland . Her sense of peace had not returned , however , and when she realized she was peering intently at each guest , she knew why . Sorcha had made no secret of her hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding , and although Adela was certain her younger sister was mistaken in thinking he would come , she could not help wondering if he would , or how she would feel if he did . Seeing no sign of that large , energetic , not to mention handsome , gentleman , she drew a long breath and released it . If she felt disappointment , she told herself it was only that his dramatic arrival might have added excitement to what was so far , despite the sunshine , a rather dull day . As a gillie helped her dismount , her two youngest sisters approached to arrange flowers in her chaplet and give her the bouquet they had gathered . " These flowers are lovely , " Adela said , smiling . " So bright and cheerful . " " Sorcha set a basket of rose petals yonder , too , for us to strew along the path before you , " Sidony said , hugging her before they took their places and Macleod signed to his piper to begin playing . Adela sighed , swept another nervous glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking around just as she was . Firmly dismissing Sir Hugo from her mind , she placed her hand on her father 's forearm. * * * As pipes skirled and the wedding party made its way up the path to the shallow porch of the kirk , Sorcha scattered her petals and wondered if the piper had mistaken Adela 's wedding for MacDonald 's funeral procession . The tune he had selected seemed more appropriate for the latter rite . Behind the makeshift altar , double doors stood shut and would not open to admit everyone for the nuptial Mass until the ceremony had ended . The priest , Wee Geordie Macleod of Lewis , stood sternly erect beside the altar with the bridegroom and his chief groomsman to welcome the bride and her maidens . Calum Tolmie , Baron Ardelve , a close cousin of the widow Macleod intended to marry , held a vast tract of land on the north shore of Loch Alsh . He was both wealthy and amiable , and thus , according to Macleod , an excellent match for Adela . Sorcha disagreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had never laid eyes on him . She still cursed her bad luck in having missed the trip to Orkney to see its prince installed , because that had been when the more fortunate Adela and their sister Isobel , each having met Sir Hugo Robison briefly before , had met him again and come to know him better . Isobel was now happily married to Sir Hugo 's cousin , Michael St. Clair ( or Sinclair , as the family had begun to spell their name ) , and they lived at Roslin Castle in Lothian . However , Sir Hugo had clearly made an impression on Adela , so Sorcha had made up her mind that Adela should marry him . Reaching the porch steps , Sorcha turned and walked a few paces to the left , then watched as Sidony went right to make way for Adela and Macleod . He stopped on the lower of the two stone steps and let Adela go on alone to the porch , where Ardelve stepped forward to meet her in front of the altar . Two low stools sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , the priest stepped forward and spread his arms wide . The piper fell silent . A gull screamed overhead . Instead of the blessing that Sorcha expected to hear , Wee Geordie said in tones that carried to everyone , " Afore I pray to the Almighty , begging Him to ha ' the goodness to shine His face upon this couple and bless the union into which they be entering , I 'm bound to ask if there be any amongst ye who kens any just cause or impediment to prevent the aforesaid union 's going forward . If ye do , speak now , mind ye , or forever keep silent about it . " As silence closed in around them , Sorcha turned her head to look at the crowd . Others , likewise , glanced at their neighbors . A low rumble sounded in the distance , almost , Sorcha thought , as if God had grown impatient and were muttering to the priest to get on with it . The thought made her smile , but when she saw heads still turning , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked that way , too . Joy stirred at the sight of four horsemen galloping toward them from woods to the south . Neighbor looked at neighbor . As delight surged through her , Sorcha glanced at Adela , expecting to see her own joy reflected in her sister , but although Adela clearly saw the riders , she showed no sign of delight . Doubtless she was stunned . Hearing more than one gasp from the gathering , Sorcha grinned . Her neighbors and friends , she knew , would talk of this day for years . But the riders were coming too fast for safety . Was their leader mad , or just drunk on the hope that he was not too late ? Villagers scattered as the riders bore down on the kirk steps . Sorcha moved , but she saw that Adela stayed where she was , mouth agape . Ardelve put his hands on his hips and glowered , but he did not move either . Sorcha decided that he thought no more of the interruption than that tardy wedding guests were making a scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks . Prickling unease stirred . Three of the men reined their horses in near villagers , making the animals rear and forcing folks back even farther . As they did , the leader urged his horse right up the two steps . Still smiling , Sorcha saw that he had eyes only for Adela , who moved toward him as if she expected him to speak to her . Instead , he leaned near , stretched out an arm , and as if she weighed no more than a feather pillow , swept her up , and wheeled his mount away from the steps . Astonished at such a show of strength , Sorcha let her mouth fall open . One or two people in the crowd cheered , but most looked stupefied as the four horsemen rode off with their prize .
