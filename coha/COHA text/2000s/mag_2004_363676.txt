To answer your question , yes , there have been a few occasions over the past two years when Norah Jones walked into Starbucks or the Body Shop and was serenaded by the sound of her own voice . " I 've managed to avoid it to a point , " Jones says , " but it has happened . Once on a plane  --  you know how they play elevator music before you take off ?  --  they played one of the songs . I have n't had to deal with it too much , but my half-sister tells me all the time , ' God , I 'm so sick of it . I hear it everywhere . ' " <P> Jones sold 8 million copies of Come Away with Me , her lovely , unpretentious 2002 debut . While that 's an incredible figure for an album by a previously unknown jazz pianist and singer , it does not really convey the extent of Jones ' ubiquity . ZZ Top once sold 8 million records , but you could avoid Eliminator by staying out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being inoffensive , authentic and really good  --  was inescapable . If Jones was n't laying down a mellow vibe for your latte , she was providing the sound track for your dinner party , the theme for your prom  --  or maybe the last dance at your biker bar . The diversity of her admirers was n't restricted to consumers either ; she is almost certainly the only person ever asked to duet with Dolly Parton , OutKast and Elmo from Sesame Street . " It 's her voice , man , " says OutKast 's Andre 3000 . " It 's just so nice . It does n't matter who you are , she kind of whispers , ' I 'm your friend .

Skeptics were soon interpreting enthusiasm as hype and positing that Come Away with Me was merely a follow-up to the O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vista Social Club  --  a pleasant little genre album that flattered its listeners ' sense of eclecticism . Never mind that her success was the rare intersection of ubiquity and quality ; to " real " music fans , the fact that nobody could find a reason not to like her was reason enough not to like her . The day after she grabbed five Grammy awards , drive-time deejays started calling her " Snorah " and wondered why there was such a loud buzz over such soft music . <P> Secretly , Jones loved both the nickname ( " My mom calls me Snorah all the time now " ) and the burgeoning consensus that her popularity had peaked . " It had all gotten way too crazy , " says Jones . " I 'm not saying I did n't want any of it or that I think I 'm undeserving , but I 'm young . I 'm still figuring out what I want . " Then : " Though I 'm pretty sure I do n't want that craziness. "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
