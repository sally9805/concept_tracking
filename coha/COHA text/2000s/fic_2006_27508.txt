February 24 FEBRUARY 1828 TANGLEFORD HALL , KENT Dearest Kate , It was splendid to see you and Thomas and your boys again this fortnight past . ( And I still think that Baby Laurence is the image of his papa , even if he is still quite bald . In deference to Thomas 's feelings , however , I shall not mention the resemblance again until little Laurence is old enough to have grown some hair . ) My only regret is that we could not stay longer at Skeynes . You have turned it into such a comfortable home that I do not wonder at your reluctance to go up to London , though I do hope James and I can coax you all to visit Tangleford next summer , so that we may return your hospitality . Two weeks was hardly enough time to catch up on all your doings of the past few months . I know James was as sorry to leave as I , and as for the children --  well , you saw how Baby Alexander cried when we left , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( I had expected it of Diana , who is only four , after all , but I had hoped that at the age of nine , the twins would have grown out of suchtricks . Apparently it takes longer than that . ) Speaking of the twins , I am afraid Arthur has confessed that he and Eleanor sneaked into Thomas 's study on the last day of our visit . Eleanor has been suffering from a trifling ailment since we left --  no more than a bad cold , but Arthur was convinced that it must be the result of some dreadful magical protection they had triggered , and so he poured out the whole story to James and me the night after we arrived home . I do not know where he can have come by such a notion , but he was so earnest in his concern that both James and I had difficulty in keeping a sober expression . I promise you that we did so , however , as neither of us wishes to encourage him to undertake any similar adventures in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason I mention it is that Thomas may need to readjust his warding spells . ( I am still not entirely sure how Arthur got past them ; please do let me know , if you should discover it . ) And I wish you would advise me whether Thomas maintains a continuous scrying spell on the gazing ball in his study . Arthur claims to have seen things in it , and if he is neither making up tales nor using an existing spell , I may need to find him a magic tutor who can oversee more advanced work than his present teacher . James is going up to London to consult with the Duke of Wellington . ( I suppose I ought now to say with the prime minister , but I am not yet accustomed to thinking of him so . ) Though I am not sure what the duke has in mind this time , I am quite pleased for him by this turn of events . James becomes bored and most unhappy when he does not have enough to do , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula when he was aide-de-camp to Lord Wellington . And whatever the duke needs , I doubt it will be boring ! At first , I had hoped to go to London along with James , but both Baby Alexander and Diana show signs of coming down with Eleanor 's cold , and I really can not leave Nurse to manage them all alone , most especially if Arthur is going to remain in good health . For he is sure to get into some scrape while her back is turned , and she has a decided partiality for him that sometimes persuades her to be less firm with him than she ought . Indeed , I am feeling nearly as sulky as the children , for I had been looking forward to seeing Aunt Elizabeth and Mr. Wrexton again . What with Mr. Wrexton 's work at the Royal College of Wizards , they are so firmly settled in London now that it is nearly impossible to induce them to visit outside the city . ( I can not bring myself to call Mr. Wrexton " Uncle Michael , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . I suppose I have never quite got out of the habit of thinking of him as my magic tutor . ) I especially wanted Mr. Wrexton 's opinion of the discursive-chain cantrips Thomas and I had that disagreement about . I had also hoped to order a few gowns in advance of the Season , and to review the redecorating of our town house ( for you know that now the duke is become prime minister , we shall have all kinds of distinguished persons visiting , so it is most important that everything be properly done ) . Now it must all be left to the last minute , for James is quite hopeless at such things . I daresay he would not notice even if the drapers put crimson drapes in the blue salon . It is most provoking , and of course I can not complain of it to James . So I write to you instead . Love , Cecy 25 FEBRUARY 1828 TANGLEFORD HALL , KENT My dear Thomas , The eldest of my young hellions has confessed to sneaking into your study near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with suitable punishment , but I trust you will let me know of any damage or disruption that he has not seen fit to mention . He has not provided any reason for the excursion other than a desire " to see a real wizard 's study . " Sometimes I think he takes after my dear Cecelia a little too much . I am off to London as soon as may be . Wellington 's summons was waiting for me when we arrived home . I am not yet entirely sure what the business is about , which will tell you a good deal right there . Unless he has good reason , Old Hookey has always been clear about his orders ; I infer that the matter is serious . I need not tell you to be discreet . Cecelia stays here with the children . I shall write when I know more , and tell you what I can .
