Section : AFFORDABLE STYLE Red Hot Right Now Your outer layer should n't cover up your other clothes ; it should complement them <p> FEW STYLE SLIPUPS are as detrimental to your overall look as draping yourself in a tentlike overcoat . Think Judd Nelson in The Breakfast Club : He could have been wearing a $4,000 suit underneath that baggy pile of wool and nobody would have known . Which is why a trim , well-tailored coat can be one of your most valuable assets . You do n't want to smother your style . " We 're seeing a return to elegance and dressing up , " says Durand Guion , men 's fashion director at Macy 's West , " so dressier pieces of outerwear are more important than ever .

Look for three-quarter length : 40 inches long , give or take , so that the coat ends at your knee . Above the knee is more casual ; longer is dressier . <p> FIT Do a wear test . Bring a sweater or suit jacket to the store with you when you 're trying on coats . Make sure there 's enough room to move comfortably when you 're wearing several layers . Really look at the shoulder lines . The back of the coat 's shoulders should lie perfectly flat , just as a suit should , says Andy Gilchrist , author of The Encyclopedia of Men 's Clothes . It 's likely you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> COLOR If you 're just starting your coat collection , invest in a basic and versatile color first : black , navy , or camel . Chocolate brown and gray are also popular right now and always elegant , says Durand Guion , men 's fashion director at Macy 's West . <p> FABRIC The main indicator of high quality is the coat 's " hand . " The fabric should feel soft and comfortable to the touch . Another consideration is how well a coat wears , says Gilchrist . " Cashmere will feel great , but it wo n't hold its shape as well as a harder-finished wool . " Alternative fabrics such as nylon blends or heavyweight canvas are n't as luxurious , but they 're more durable and better for men who live in warm climates , where there 's less need for wool . <p> DETAILS Make sure all stitching and buttons on the coat are secure and tight . And check the collar , Guion says . It should stand up nicely on its own when you lift it . How to Wear It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-collared sweaters retain warmth on cold days and add detail to your outfit . Let them stick up over the coat lapels if you want ; it 's an edgier look . <p> MIX IT UP . It 's okay to wear a dressy coat with jeans . <p> GO MONOCHROME . Once in a while , stick with all one color for an outfit ; it can make a powerful statement . Try a navy coat over a navy suit and navy tie  --  with a crisp white shirt for contrast . Not that . <p> DO N'T EMBARRASS YOURSELF . Remove that label near the edge of the sleeve once you buy the coat . ( Do n't laugh : We 've seen lots of smart men who did n't know better . ) <p> DO N'T HANG OUT . Your overcoat should always be longer than the suit or sport coat you 're wearing underneath . This goes for suit sleeves , too . Slice of the suit 's sleeve showing ? Visit your tailor . <p> DO N'T HESITATE TO ACCESSORIZE . If your overcoat is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add contrast to your look . If your overcoat has a pattern , go with solid accessories . It 's all about balance . <p> DO N'T GET WIRED . Always hang your coat on a sturdy wooden suit hanger instead of a flimsy wire or plastic one . This will retain the shape of the coat 's shoulders , so yours look good wearing it .  --  BRIAN BOY , MEN 'S HEALTH FASHION DIRECTO <p> <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>
