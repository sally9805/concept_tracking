Whenever Meg Whitman gets up onstage before a crowd of eBay users , she makes a point of being self-effacing  --  even when they are all chanting her name . Typically , her first words to adoring online auctioneers are , " This is about you . " In a sense , she 's right : eBay would not be what it is today  --  one of the fastest-growing companies in America , collecting more than $2 billion in annual revenue  --  without its virtual community of approximately 30 million active users . They are the ones who are trading $900 worth of goods and services a second on her website . <P> But Whitman , 47 , is not just the genial host at this giant party , picking up a fee for each listing and a small percentage of each sale . She 's also the quiet giant of the Internet world , one of a mere handful of Silicon Valley CEOs who survived the dotcom bubble with her reputation unscathed . A business veteran , she cut her teeth in the top echelons of Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Keds shoes and FTD florists . When she was offered her current job in 1998 , Whitman was highly skeptical . Why leave everything she had built for her family in Boston and move 3,000 miles away to become CEO of , as she called it , a " no-name Internet company " ? <P> Whitman was persuaded of eBay 's worth by its founder , Pierre Omidyar , a business novice who desperately needed her smarts . Her skepticism fell away forever when she attended a focus group of eBay users shortly after she joined . " Their passion for eBay good and bad was like nothing I 'd ever seen in 20 years of business , " says Whitman . " I 'm reminded of it on a daily basis . " <P> She still responds directly to e-mails from buyers and sellers . A mother of two , Whitman knows that some of eBay 's biggest customers are people who never thought they would touch a computer . She pays homage to them on Oprah as well as at trade shows . If a new eBay feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained about not being able to use the electronic payment service PayPal for eBay transactions , she bought PayPal for $1.5 billion . Which explains why they chant her name . And why this self-effacing star is the envy of just about everyone in the Web world .  --  By Chris Taylor
