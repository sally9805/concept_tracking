St. Louis Globe April 10 , 1864 Terrible raid in Sikeston , Missouri confederate irregulars kill women and children Special to the Globe -- Intelligence received by this newspaper says that thirty-seven people were killed when Rebel raiders invaded the town of Sikeston , Missouri . It is said that the leader of the Rebels singled out all males between the age of sixteen and sixty , led them to the center of town and shot them before the eyes of their wives and children . It is not certain who led the raid , though initial reports stated that that the leader was none other than William Quantrill . However , subsequent information suggests that it was more likely either " Bloody Quint " Wilson or Jesse " the Executioner " Cole . The attack , it is said , took place just at sunrise , catching many of Sikeston 's citizens during their morning ablutions . There appeared to be no military purpose to the raid , which resulted only in wanton killing and the looting and burning of homes . " Are you sure the train will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The train has to have water , does n't it , Sergeant ? " Jesse Cole replied . " I reckon so , " Kincaid answered . Jesse pointed to the water tower that stood alongside the railroad tracks . " Well , there 's the water . That means the trainwill stop . " Jesse climbed up the rock-covered berm and stood on the track , looking back toward the east . " I sure wish it was a little darker , though . " The full moon made it almost as light as day , making the twin ribbons of steel gleam softly . " Hey , Jesse , do you really think there is Yankee gold on that train ? " Gus asked . " It 's Major Cole , not Jesse , " Kincaid said , correcting him . " I did n't mean no disrespect or nothin ' , " Gus said . " But technically , he ai n't no major . The Confederate Congress ai n't never give him a commission . " " No , but West Point did , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Point is a Yankee school , " Gus said . " Robert E. Lee went to West Point , " Kincaid said . " Yeah , I guess you 're right , " Gus agreed . " So , what about it , Major ? Do you really think there is Yankee gold on the train ? " " According to the letter that was on that courier we killed the other day , there is , " Jesse said . " What are we going to do with it ? I mean , with the Yankees all around us , there 's no way we can give it to the Confederate cause . " " We 're Confederates , are n't we ? " Jesse replied . " We 'll just give it to ourselves . " " Yeah ! " Kincaid said . " Yeah , now I like that idea . I like that a lot ! " " The only thing is , if there is Yankee gold on that train , then there 's bound to be Yankee soldiers as well , " Gus said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've killed Yankees before , have n't we ? " Gus laughed . " Yeah , we have at that . Fact is , I reckon Cole 's Raiders have killed more Yankees than just about anybody . More'n Quantrill or Anderson , or Quint Wilson . " From behind , they heard the sound of someone urinating . " Damn , Van , that 's the third or fourth time you 've taken a piss since we got here , " Kincaid said . " What 's the matter ? Have you got a leak in you , somewhere ? " " I ca n't help it , " Van said as he finished his business and buttoned his pants . " I 'm nervous , and whenever I get nervous , I pee . " " Yeah , well , there 's nothin ' to be nervous about , is there , Major ? I mean there are ten of us and there is n't likely to be any more'n a hundred or so of the Yankee soldiers . I 'd say the odds were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kincaid --  " " It 's Sergeant Kincaid , " Kincaid corrected . " All right , Sergeant Kincaid . You 're as full of shit as a Christmas goose , " Gus said , and the others laughed as well . " How many soldiers do you think they 'll have , Jesse . . . uh , I mean , Major . " " Probably no more than three or four to guard the gold , " Jesse answered . In the distance the men heard the long , lonesome wail of a train whistle . " There it is , " Jesse said . " Sergeant , get the men in position , and stay out of sight until I give the word . " " Yes , sir , " Kincaid answered . " I do n't see it yet , " Van said . " You will . Just keep looking that way , " Jesse said . They heard the whistle a couple more times before they saw it . And even then they did n't see the train , but they did see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in front of a mirrored reflector . The reflector gathered all the light from the gas flame , intensified it , and then projected it forward in a long beam that stabbed ahead , picking up insects to gleam in the light . The train whistled again , and this time they could hear the puffing of the steam engine as it labored hard to pull the train through the night . " Remember , nobody makes a move until I give the order , " Jesse said . " We do n't want to take a chance on being seen . " Jesse walked up onto the track and stayed there until all his men were in position . He looked to see if any of them could be seen from the approaching train , then , satisfied that they could not , he ran back down to join them . He watched the train approach , listening to the puffs of steam as it escaped from the pistons . He could see bright sparks embedded in the heavy black smoke that poured from the flared smokestack . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet of orange-glowing embers laying between the rails and trailing out behind the train , glimmering for a moment or two in the darkness before finally going dark themselves . The train began squeaking and clanging as the engineer applied the brakes . It grew slower , and slower still , until finally it approached the water tower . The engineer brought his train to a stop in exactly the right place . By now the fireman was already standing on the tender , reaching for the line that hung down from the curved mouth of the long water spout . Continues ...
