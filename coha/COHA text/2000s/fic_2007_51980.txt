With the passel of stories he has published in our pages and in Asimov 's over the last three years , Daryl Gregory has become one of the field 's rising stars . His first novel , Pandemonium is due out next year ; he describes it as a book about demonic possession , Jungian archetypes , and golden age comics . His latest story has no relation to comics that we could discern , but enthusiasts of children 's fiction will probably find much of interest here ... as will , we hope , all our other leaders . TWO IN THE MORNING AND he 's stumbling around in the attic , lost in horizontal archaeology : the further he goes , the older the artifacts become . The stuttering flashlight guides him past boxes of Christmas decorations and half-dead appliances , past garbage bags of old blankets and outgrown clothing stacked and bulging like black snowmen , over and around the twenty-year-old rubble of his son 's treasures : Tonka trucks and science fair projects , soccer trophies and summer camp pottery . His shoulder brushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sliding , and somewhere in the dark a mirror or storm window smashes . The noise does n't matter . There 's no one in the house below him to disturb . Twenty feet from the far wall his way is blocked by a heap of wicker lawn furniture . He pulls apart the barricade piece by piece to make a narrow passage and scrapes through , straws tugging at his shirt . On the other side he crawls up and onto the back of a tilting oak desk immovable as a ship run aground . The territory ahead is littered with the remains of his youth , the evidence of his life before he brought his wife and son to this house . Stacks of hardcover books , boxes of dusty - framed elementary school pictures - and toys . So many toys . Once upon a time he was theT ) oy who did n't like to go outside , the boy who never wanted to leave his room . The Boy Who Always Said No . Against the far wall , beside a rickety shelf of dried-out paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive shape . He picks his way through the crowded space . When he pulls aside the cloth , he grunts as if he 's been elbowed in the stomach - relief and dread and wrenching sadness competing for the same throat . Dust coats the Wonder Bike 's red fenders , rust freckles its handlebars . The white-walled tires are flat , and stuffing sprouts from cracks in the leather saddle . But it 's still here , still safe . And the two accessories he most needs , the things he 'd almost convinced himself he 'd imagined , are fastened to their places on the swooping crossbar : the five-pronged gearshift like a metal hand , - and the glass-covered compass , its face scuffed white but uncracked . The bike 's heavier than he remembers , all old-fashioned steel , more solid than anything they 'd bother to make today . He heaves it onto his shoulder and makes his way toward the attic door , handlebars snagging on unseen junk , errant wheels triggering miniature avalanches . Sweat pours down his back . He thinks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man if he lives to a hundred and twelve . People younger than that die all the time . All the time . The weight of the bike drags him down the attic stairs . He wheels it whinging down the hall , then out the front door and across the frost-crackled lawn , aiming for the realtor sign . The sweat on his neck turns cold . Along the street his neighbors " houses are all dark . The moon stays tucked into its bed of clouds . He 's grateful for the privacy . He lifts the front wheel and runs over the For Sale sign , flattens it . In the garage he sets to work removing the accessories . The screws are rusted into place , so he puts aside the screwdriver and plugs in the power drill . The shifter comes free , but the screws holding the compass are stripped , spinning uselessly . He ca n't risk hammering it off , so he works a hacksaw blade between the handlebars and the bottom of the device and cuts it free . Gently he sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . It takes much less time to attach the accessories to the dash . He screws them directly into the plastic , side by side above the radio . He starts the engine and stares out the dirt-streaked windshield , trying to remember what to do next . It used to be automatic : pedal hard , thumb the gears , follow the compass . But something happened when he turned thirteen . He lost the knack and the bike stopped working for him . Or maybe , he 's been thinking lately , he stopped working for the bike . He sets the DeShifter to not recommended . He taps the glass of the UnCompass and the needle quivers , stuck between unfamiliar and UNKNOWN . Sounds about right , he thinks . EVEN WITH THE COMPASS it takes determination to get lost . He drives south out of town , past the tangle of interstate exchanges , toward the green empty parts of the map . He turns down the first road he does n't recognize . He pays no attention to street names ; he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no signs . Forest swallows the highway . Switchbacks and the skulking moon conspire with him to disguise his direction . Do n't look in the rearview mirror , he tells himself . No trail of bread crumbs . As soon as he thinks of the road behind him , he realizes he left the front door of the house wide open . Maybe by morning robbers will have emptied the place . That would make it easier on the real estate agents . Too much clutter , they 'd told him . They could n't see that the home had been gutted a year ago . He rolls down the window and lets the cold wind buffet him . When did he fall out of love with speed ? He 'd had adventures once . He 'd rescued the Pumpkinhead Boys , raced the moto-crows , reunited the shards of the Glass Kingdom . His quick thinking had outwitted the Hundred Mayors of Stilt Town . He nudges the DeShifter past INADVISABLE to ABSOLUTELY not and accelerates . The road ahead does n't exist until it appears under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , unrolling the road before him like a carpet . A tiny yellow sign flashes past his right fender , too fast for him to read . He glances sideways - nothing but the dark - and turns back to the road just as the little purple house appears in his lights like a phantom . The structure strikes the grille and explodes into a thousand pieces . The windshield pocks with white stars . He stomps on the brake and the car bucks , slides sideways . He jerks the wheel back to the right and suddenly the car 's off the road , jouncing across ground . He bounces against the roof , ragdolling , unable to hold onto the wheel . The car bangs sideways against something invisible and immovable and then everything stops . He stares out the cratered windshield . The engine coughs politely , shudders , and dies . The DeShifter shows completely out of the question . The UnCompass needle points straight at UNPOSSIBLE . Later - he 's as unsure of time as he is of location - he forces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush , and climbs out and down . The driver-side wheels are two feet in the air . Trees surround the car as if they 'd grown up around it . He walks up a slight incline to the road , his pulse driving a headache deeper into his temples . The muscles of his neck burn , - his chest aches where the seatbelt cut into him . The surface of the road is littered with shattered plywood - and bits of silver . He stoops , drumming fresh pain into his head , and picks up a dime . There are coins all over the roadway . The only thing remaining of the tollbooth is another of the child-sized yellow signs , miraculously erect : please have your destination in MIND . He drops the dime into his pocket and starts walking . A farmhouse squats in the middle of the highway like a great toad , filling both lanes . He walks toward it in the inconstant moonlight , horrified . If he had n't struck the tollbooth , he 'd have slammed into the house at eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it 's been dropped there from a great height . Walls are askew , their wooden siding bowed , splintered , or blown out completely . Roofs cant at contrary angles . He steps onto the porch and floorboards creak and shift under his weight like unstable ice . High-pitched barking erupts from inside . He knocks on the door and waits , hunched and shivering . A minute passes . The dog - a small , hyperactive thing by the sound of it - barks and barks . He crouches next to the closest window but gauzy curtains obscure the view . He makes out a lamp , th suggestion of a couch , a dark rectangle that could be a bookshelf or a wardrobe . His teeth are on the edge of chattering . He knocks again and sends the dog into fresh vocal frenzy . He considers trying the doorknob . It 's warm in there . There could be a phone . How big can the dog be ? He backs off the porch and walks around the side of the house . It 's nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the windows at the back of the house , if there are windows at all , are unfit . He ca n't even tell if the road continues on the side . He moves in what he thinks is an arc , feeling for the scrape of pavement under his . shoes , when suddenly he bangs his toes against something low and hard and stumbles forward . He catches his balance - and freezes , realizing where he 's standing . He 's in the middle of train tracks . He does n't hear anything , does n't see anything but the eye-swallowing dark . Slowly he steps back over the rails , a chill in his stomach even though he 'd see a train coming for miles . The dog resumes barking , and the sound is different somehow . He circles around to the front of the house and sees that the front door is open now , light spilling around some dark shape filling the doorway . " Hello ? " he says . He holds out his hands as he steps toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple miles down the road . " " You came by car ? " A woman 's voice , low and rasping . " I had an accident , " he says again . " If you 've got a phone , I could call someone .... " " The road 's closed to your type . " He 's not sure if she 's warning him or merely stating fact . Her shadow recedes . After a moment he approaches the door . The dog , a tiny black terrier with an age-whitened snout , lies in a towel-lined wicker basket a few feet from the door . It bares its teeth at him and growls , but makes no move to leave its bed . He steps inside the room . The woman 's already sitting , leaning back in an old leather armchair the color of dried mud . The light is behind her so again her face is in shadow . She crosses her legs , sharp white shins over blood-red slippers . She pulls a foil pack from the pocket of her blue-checked housedress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest and tries to stop shivering . At least the house is warm . He looks around for a phone but knows he wo n't find one - it 's not that kind of house . It 's been a long time , but the old instincts are coming back . He smiles thinly . " And what type would that be , ma'am ? " " Storm-chaser , " she says . " Wardrobe-jumper . " She flicks a cheap plastic fighter and holds the flame to the cigarette . " Mirror shards sticking to your coat , twigs in your hair . Little hard to squeeze that big ol " man-body through the hedgerow , eh ? " " You do n't know me . You do n't know who I am . " " Oh my goodness , you must be the special one , " she says in mock recognition . " You must be the only traveler to see lands beyond . " She taps cigarette ash onto the braided rug . " Let me guess - enchanted sailboat ? Magic choo-choo train ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric kiddie car , then . The tollbooth boy . " " I had a bicycle , " he says . " The most wonderful - " She groans . " Spareme . " She inhales on her cigarette , shakes her head . " At least you got rid of it . Most of you ca n't find your way back without the props . " She sees his frown and laughs . Smoke spills from her mouth and hazes the lights . " You think you 're the first one to try to sneak back in ? " she says . " You 're not even the first one tonight . " She laughs again . " Boo-hoo-hoo , my wife left me , whaaa , my daughters hate me . Life is meaningless , I 'm gon na kill myself . " " I do n't have a daughter , " he says . " And my wife did n't leave me . " But of course she had . She left him in the most absolute way , leaving behind a note like a set of driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years later to the day , their son followed her . Tonight , come to think of it , is the anniversary of their deaths . He takes a breath . " I 'm just looking for a way back . " " Please . You could n't find your shadow if it was stapled on . You think you can just waltz right back in there nursing your disappointments and diseases , your head stuffed full of middle-age sex fantasies and mortgage payments ? You 'd ruin everything . You 'd stink the place up . " " You do n't understand , " he says . " I only need - " " Stink . It . Up . " She makes a tired shooing gesture . " Go home , you greedy little boy . No second helpings . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " This is a test , he thinks . She 's trying to throw him off , weigh him down with doubt and discouragement . He 's met such trials before , and persevered . Once upon a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in confirmation he hears a distant bell , a cheery ding ding ! He recognizes that sound . He strides out of the room , into the dark kitchen , and flips open the hook to the back door . " You 'll never get on ! " the woman calls . The dog begins to bark . The dark , to his light-adjusted eyes , seems almost solid . He stops a few feet from the house and listens . The trolley must be close by . The little bell sounds again , but he ca n't tell if it 's growing closer or more distant . He moves forward slowly , arms out , feet sliding forward . The track is only a few yards from the house , he 's sure of it . His feet drag through the unseen grass . After a few minutes he glances back , but now the house is gone as well . He turns in place , eyes wide . There 's no sound , not even barking . A dank , dead-fish scent twists in the air . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape in the distance , barely distinguishable against a black sky edging toward indigo . It 's the first hint since he left the attic that the night is not endless . He does n't know what it is in the distance , but he recognizes the shape for what it is : unfamiliar , unknown . THE LITTLE BOAT lies at the bottom of the empty seabed , abandoned midway between the shore and the island . Sandy mud sucks at his shoes . He walks toward it , past stacks of smooth-headed boulders and stinking saltwater puddles in the shape of great clawed feet . He walks under a sky the color of pencil lead . The island is shaped like a bowler hat . If not for the trees - a handful of curve-backed palms with outrageously broad leaves - and for the hunched figure silhouetted at the very crown of the hill , he 'd have thought the island was huge but miles away . Instead he can see that it 's ridiculously small , like a cartoon desert island . He reaches the boat and rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat is an unmade bed , a white pillow and blue blankets and white sheets . Foot-shaped holes , human-size , stamp away from the boat toward the island . He follows them across the drained sea to the rim of the island , where his predecessor 's mud-laden feet begin to print the grass . The trail leads up the slope , between bushes tinged yellow and brown . Only a few of the palm trees are standing ; dozens of others are uprooted and lying on the ground , or else split and bent , as if savaged by a hurricane . He climbs , breath ragged in his throat . The man at the top of the hill is facing away , toward the lightening sky . On his back is some kind of white fur shawl - no , a suit like a child 's f ootie pajamas , arms tied around his neck . The yawning hood is a wolf 's head that 's too small for his grownman 's head . He 's huffing , making a lot of noise as he approaches , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he 's caught his breath he says , " Beautiful , is n't it ? " Above them the sky is fitful gray , but across the vast , empty sea in the land beyond , sunlight sparkles on the crystal minarets of the Glassine Palace . A great-winged roc dangling a gondola from its claws flaps toward its next fare . The rolling hills beyond the city are golden and ripe for harvest . It 's all as he remembers . " Look at those wild things go , " the man in the wolf suit says . Who knows what he 's seeing ? The sun crawls higher , but the clouds above the hill refuse to disperse . He glances at the man in the wolf suit , looks away . Tears have cut tracks down his muddy and unshaven face . The wolf man 's older than he , but not by much . What did the woman in the house say ? Not even the fust one tonight . He nods at the man 's wedding ring and says , " Ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Left me six months ago . I had it coming for years . " He smiles faintly . " Could n't quite stop making mischief . You ? " " She died a few years ago . " But the damage had n't stopped there , had it ? He tilts his head , a half shrug . " Depression runs in her family . " " Sorry to hear that . " He slowly shakes his head , and the upside-down wolf 's head wags with him . " It 's a disaster out there . Every day like an eraser . Days into months , months into years - gone , gone , gone . " The man in the wolf suit stares at him without blinking . " Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me you were having a happy ending . " " No . " He almost grins . " Not even close . " But was that true ? He 'd had a dozen happy endings . A score of them . Together they stare across the ocean of mud and squint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in there , " he says to the man with the suit . He 's surprised by bis certainty . But he ca n't imagine tracking that muck across the crystal streets . " And we ca n't stay here . " He rubs a hand across his mouth . " Come with me . " The man does n't answer . " I could make you leave . " The man in the wolf suit laughs . " Do n't you know who I am ? " he says . " I 'm their king ! " " No , " he says . " Not anymore . " He grips the edges of the white fur and yanks it over the man 's head and off , quick as a magic trick . " I 'm the king now . " He runs down the hill holding the suit above his head like a flag . The man roars a terrible roar . It 's a chase down to the sea 's edge and then they 're tumbling in the muck , wrapped up and rolling like bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the suit . They tug it back and forth , the cloth rasping as threads stretch and tear . Then the zipper snaps and they fall away from each other , splash down on their asses . They look at each other , too winded to get up . The man clutches the scrap of fur he 's regained . It 's not white anymore . " Why 'd you do that ? " he says . He 's not sure . He flicks mud from his hands , wipes a hand clean on the inside of his shirt , runs a knuckle across his mouth . " It was the only thing I could think of . " The man looks at him . A smile works at the corners of his mud-spattered mouth . He makes a sound like a cough , and then he 's laughing , they 're both laughing . They sit in the mud , roaring . Eventually they help each other out of the muck . " We screwed it up , " the man says . " How did we screw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . " I do n't think we were supposed to keep them safe , " he answers . He hands him the remnant of the suit . " This , the bed , the Wonder Bike - all that stuff . We were n't supposed to hoard them . " The man looks stricken . " What ? " " We were supposed to give them away . " " Oh my God , " the man says quietly . " Oh my God . " They begin to trudge across the drained sea . They trade stories about their adventures . The man with the wolf suit takes out his wallet and shows him pictures . He has a granddaughter he 's never met , six years old , a real hellion by all accounts . " She fives three states away , " he says . A dozen yards from the shore they see the trolley . The little car glides smoothly around the perimeter of the lake and stops in their path . It rolls a few feet forward , a few feet back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they would a deer at a watering hole . It trembles as they step up onto the gleaming sideboards . They sit on the polished wooden benches . It 's a shame their clothes are so filthy . The trolley does n't move . " Wait , " he says , and the man in the wolf suit watches him dig into his pocket . The dime he found on the roadway is still there . The coin clinks into the tin fare box and the car jerks into motion . Soon they 're zipping across the plain toward the forest and the black ribbon of highway . " And yourself ? " the man with the suit says . " No grandchildren , " he says . " No children . Not anymore . " The man frowns and nods . " We 'll find someone for the bike , " he says . " The world is full of children . "
