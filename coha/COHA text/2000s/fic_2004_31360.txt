I spent a long afternoon at the morgue . I had left my desk at the Manhattan district attorney 's office shortly after lunch to review autopsy results on a new case with the deputy chief medical examiner . A nineteen-year-old , dressed in an outfit she had bought just hours earlier , was killed outside a social club as she waited on a street corner for her friends . Now I walked a quiet corridor , again surrounded by death . I did not want to be here . I paused at the entrance of an ancient tomb , its painted limestone facade concealing the false doorway to an underground burial chamber . The faded reliefs that decorated its walls showed offerings of food and drink that would nourish the spirit of the dead . I did n't harbor any hope that the young woman whose body I had seen today would ever be in need of the kind of good meal displayed before me . I made my way past a granite lion and nodded at the uniformed guard , who slouched on a folding chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a royal grave . Both were sleeping soundly . The outstretched arms of the neighboring alabaster monkeys held empty vessels that had no doubt been receptacles of the body parts of some mummified dignitary of the Old Kingdom . Voices echoing from behind me suggested that I was not going to be the last arrival at this evening 's festive dinner . I quickened my pace and swept by cases filled with goddesses ' stone heads , perched on shelves holding jeweled sandals and golden collars that had been buried with them for centuries . A sharp left turn brought me face-to-face with the enormous black sarcophagus of a ThirtiethDynasty Egyptian queen , held open by two iron posts , so that passersby could see the image of her soul portrayed on the inside of the upper lid . The dark , heavy casket with a faint outline of the slender body it once housed chilled me , despite the unseasonal warmth of the late-spring night . Then I turned the last corner , where the darkness of the funereal rooms gave way to the glorious open space that housed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of Art was a sloping , glass-paned wall soaring above the sandstone monuments , opening the vista into Central Park . It was almost nine o'clock , and the streetlamps beyond the windows lightened the night sky , giving definition to the leafy green trees bordering the great institution . I stood at the edge of the moat that surrounded the two raised buildings in this stunning wing , searching the crowd for my friends . Waiters in sleek black suits zigzagged back and forth among the guests , stopping to dispense smoked salmon on black bread and caviar blinis . They were trailed by others who carried silver trays filled with glasses of white wine , champagne , and sparkling water , dodging the elbows and arms of the assembled museum members and supporters . Nina Baum saw me before I spotted her . " You came just late enough to miss most of the speeches . Smart move . " She signaled to one of the servers , and handed me a flute of champagne . " Hungry ? " I shook my head . " The morgue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Was she  --  ? " " I 'll tell you about it later . Chapman thought he had a lead on a case he 's been handling that 's reached a dead end , so I wanted to get a clear understanding about the pattern of injuries and how they 'd been inflicted . That way , if he picked up a suspect and I got a chance to question the guy tonight , I 'd be ready for him . Turned out to be a bad tip , so there 's no interrogation , no arrest . It 's on the back burner for a while . " Nina looped her arm through mine and started to walk me toward the steps . " Why did n't you bring Mike with you ? " " I tried . Once I told him it was black tie he sent me home to shower and change . No penguin suit for him , not even to see you . He 'll catch you later in the week . " Mike Chapman was a homicide detective . Best one on the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , and had been for exactly half my life . We were eighteen when we met , assigned to be roommates at Wellesley College when we arrived freshman year . She was married now , living in California with her husband and young son . She had met Mike many times during the decade that he and I had worked together on cases , and she looked forward to spending time with him whenever she was in town . " First we 'll find Jake . " She led me up the steps , past the lone palm tree that stood on the platform below the great temple . " Then I 'll introduce you to my boss and all the museum heavyweights . " " How 's Jake behaving ? You still have a job after tonight or is he hounding everybody here , looking for scoops ? " " Let 's say we 've raised a lot of eyebrows around town . I keep telling people that I 've only borrowed him for the evening , but when you read tomorrow 's gossip columns , you might begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , ' cause they ca n't figure out why I 'm hanging on to him and why you 're nowhere to be seen . " " ' Who is that auburn-haired beauty who whisked in from the coast and stole NBC correspondent Jake Tyler right out from under the long arm of the law ? Prosecutor Alexandra Cooper has a warrant out for her arrest . And also for the return of the terrifically sexy  --  and backless  --  navy blue sequined dress that this interloper slipped out of Alexandra 's closet when she was n't looking . ' That 's what I 'm likely to see in the tabs ? " " I figured you loaned me the guy for the evening , how sore could you be about the sexy , backless gown ? " Nina had arrived in New York a day earlier . She was a partner in a major L.A. law firm , where she had developed an expertise in packaging large entertainment projects for big-screen and television movies . Tonight 's event was staged to announce an historic occasion for two great New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of Natural History , with some help from Hollywood , would hold the first cooperative exhibition in their histories . The controversial mix of scholarship and show business had had a difficult birth , struggling to overcome resistance from trustees and curators , administrators and city officials . But blockbuster shows like the Met 's " Treasures of Tutankhamen " and the Costume Institute 's collection of Jacqueline Kennedy 's White House clothing filled the museum coffers and argued for the drama of a spectacular twenty-first-century display of the two museums ' collective greatest hits . Nina 's California client , UniQuest Productions , had successfully bid on all the media marketing rights to the new project . " A Modern Bestiary , " as the show had been titled , would feature all the fantastic animals of the world , as represented in both collections , from hieroglyphs , tapestries , and paintings to mounted specimens and stuffed mammals . There would be dazzling , high-tech creations and virtual dioramas , IMAX time trips to examine artists and artifacts in their natural habitats , and commercial tie-ins for souvenir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be Rembrandt refrigerator magnets , triceratops lapel pins , plastic human-genome Slinkys to bounce down staircases across America , and snow globes with endangered species of the Amazon being doused by acid rain . Nina steered me toward a short , dark-haired man with too much facial hair and a collarless tux shirt . " Quentin Vallejo , I 'd like you to meet Alexandra Cooper . She 's  --  " " I know , I know . The best friend . " Quentin did the up-and-down thing . My five-ten frame towered over him , so his eyes just focused at the level of my breasts and worked their way south to my knees before lifting back up to meet my glance . " The sex crimes prosecutor . Nina talked about you for the entire flight yesterday . That 's an interesting job you 've got . We ought to have a chat sometime , just the two of us . Like to hear more about what you do . " Quentin turned to exchange his empty wineglass for a full one , and I gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss and followed me . " That 's the guy who 's running this show ? " " Worked with Spielberg for twelve years . He 's absolutely ingenious at designing interactive materials and futuristic movie images . Makes inanimate objects look like flesh and blood . He sees things in ways that nobody else does . " " That much was obvious to me . " I stood on tiptoes , looking over heads and shoulders for any sign of Jake . " Did the big guns at the Met and Natural History ever meet Quentin before today ? " " You think we would n't have done a deal if they had ? " " Have you lost your mind ? This museum was founded by old men . Very rich , very white , very Presbyterian . Natural History was pretty much the same . The good old boys may be dead and buried , but this place is n't exactly run by the most diverse crowd in town . " " Somebody on the project did his homework . Our advance group managed all the hands-on work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preppiest-looking film team I 've ever seen west of the Mississippi . Hired a white-shoe law firm here to handle the contract work . Saved the outing of Quentin for tonight 's gala , the big announcement . " " How 'd that go ? " " Listen to the buzz . The trustees , the press , the upper crust  --  whoever these people are , they seemed thrilled about the news . " Nina steered me to the small recess at the center of the taller building , the gateway to the Temple of Dendur . She was looking for a quieter place to tell me about the presentation that I had missed . " Do you know Pierre Thibodaux ? " She pointed to the podium , where a tall , dark-haired man was being led away from a small group of museum officials . He motioned to his colleagues with a raised finger and stepped into the adjacent corridor . " Only by reputation . New guy in town . " Thibodaux had replaced Philippe de Montebello as director of the Met less than three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance crew himself . This show is his baby . Brilliant , mercurial , handsome . You 've got to meet him  --  " " Ladies , you ca n't be leaning against the building , y'all hear me ? " a security guard said . We walked out of the narrow opening and searched for another quiet nook . " Let 's get out of this wing so we can have a normal conversation . There are as many living , breathing jackals in here tonight as there are limestone ones standing sentry over all the Egyptian galleries . I somehow think poor Augustus did n't foresee when he built these monuments that they would become the most prized cocktail space in Manhattan . " I could tell that Nina was annoyed with me , as she tried to follow me back down the steps . " Who 's Augustus ? What the hell are you talking about ? The temple is Egyptian , right ? " I had been coming to the Met since my earliest childhood , and knew most of the permanent exhibits pretty well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Roman emperor who ruled that region at the time . Augustus had it erected in honor of two young sons of a Nubian chieftain who drowned in the Nile . I hate to dampen your enthusiasm , Nina . I 've just been around too much death today not to wonder why we find it appropriate to organize our festivities in and around the tombs of all these ancient cultures . Would n't people find it offensive to have the next cocktail party at Arlington Cemetery ? " " Sorry they 're not serving scotch tonight , Alex . Take it easy , will you ? We can leave any time you 'd like . Who 's the old dame hanging on to Jake ? " He had spotted the two of us and was making his way to the foot of the platform on which we stood . A silver-haired woman with lots of dangling sapphires  --  from earlobes , wrists , fingers  --  had grasped Jake by the arm and was bending his ear about something . I stopped on the bottom step and fished in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look out for that crocodile , darling . The most dangerous creature in Egypt , the embodiment of the essence of evil . " Jake held out his hand to lower me down as I tossed a few quarters in the water , for good luck . The ebony croc mocked the gesture , his gaping mouth posed for eternity , seeking something meatier than the quiche that was being circulated around the room . I kissed Jake 's cheek , which was already covered with the shapes of pursed lips in a variety of colors . " I do n't mind that you 're in loco husband for Nina , but who 's the rest of my competition ? " " That last woman ? Just one of the trustees . Did n't catch her name . Gushing about how exciting the joint show is going to be and asking whether the networks are covering the fireworks tonight . " " Fireworks ? " " There 's supposed to be a preview , a five-minute sound-and-light show to kick off the news about the bestiary exhibition . Here comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the director walked straight toward us , smoothing his jacket with one hand and his hair with the other . " Nina , may I have a word with you ? Do you know where Quentin is ? " " I 'll find him for you . Pierre , I 'd like you to meet my  --  " " Enchante . " He greeted us tersely but his eyes searched the room over my shoulder . He and Nina broke away , retracing our steps to look for the producer . I glanced at my watch . " Soon as we tear her loose , think you 'd treat your two dates to burgers at ' 21 ' ? " " My chariot awaits you , madam . " Nina , Quentin , and Pierre had their heads together at the top of the stairs . The director did a double take over his shoulder as Quentin pointed down at me . Nina was shaking her head in the negative and trying to block me from Quentin 's line of sight . You 're right , pal . Whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't wait for the others to descend the two tiers of steps . " Miss Cooper ? Mr. Vallejo just told me that you 're a prosecutor . May I have a moment with you , alone , for some advice ? Do you mind , Mr. Tyler ? " This time , no guard admonished us as Thibodaux led me back up to the platform , removed the rope between the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple of Dendur , and stepped into the quiet archway . " You 're a bureau chief in the Manhattan district attorney 's office ? I need your help in dealing with the police tonight . " " Here , at the museum ? " " No , actually , in a freight yard . I 'm going to make a few remarks to close the evening and send all these people on their way . We 'll forgo the drama of the UniQuest Productions pyrotechnics . The last thing we need tomorrow is any bad publicity linked to our splendid new show . " " Perhaps I can make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipment of exhibits going abroad , stored in containers for transit . It 's a very routine occurrence for us . Crates go in and out of the country all the time . Exchanges with other museums , items we 've deaccessioned or loaned to foreign institutions . Happens regularly . " " I doubt there 's anything that I can help you with . If you 've got a problem with Customs  --  " I said , as Thibodaux continued to speak over my objection . " What does n't usually happen is that one of the ancient sarcophagi was opened for inspection a few hours ago . There was supposed to be a mummified princess in the coffin , Miss Cooper . Twelfth Dynasty , Middle Kingdom . A couple of thousand years old and quite valuable . Instead , there 's a corpse inside . Someone has substituted a body , I 'm afraid . A few centuries younger than my princess , no doubt , but just as dead . "                 @ @ @ @
