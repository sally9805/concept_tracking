In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Huckleberry Finn quit school . He explained , " I had been to school .. and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and I do n't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever . " Perhaps not . But if he had worked his math problems on yellow paper , he might have been more hopeful about his future in math . If he had been sitting in a yellow room , he probably would have figured out that six times seven is forty-two . Why ? Because experiments prove that math problems worked on yellow paper have fewer errors than problems written on other colors of paper . Fewer math mistakes occur in a yellow room than in rooms of other colors . But if you have a thinking or word problem , settle down in a blue room . A blue environment is the most helpful in figuring out thought problems . The class you like least in school wo n't seem so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass more quickly in a green room than in rooms of other colors . Salespeople whose watches had been taken away thought their threehour meeting in a green room had lasted about half that time . But a similar group meeting in a red room thought their three-hour meeting had lasted six hours . Photograph // Exposure to a red environment excites people and raises their heart and pulse rates . Alonzo Stagg , former head football coach for the University of Chicago , gave pep talks to his players in a red dressing room . He sent them to a blue dressing room for rest periods . Nowhere in sports is a red and blue environment used to better advantage than at the University of New Mexico . The home team uses a red locker room . But visiting opponents are treated to the tranquilizing effects of a blue locker room . London residents were upset about the number of persons leaping to their death from Black Friar 's Bridge . After the gloomy black structure was painted blue , the suicide rate dropped by one-third . The walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were painted blue . Unruly behavior disappeared . Although some of the children were blind , they were as soothed by the blue environment as were the sighted children . Blue is second only to pink for its soothing effect . In another experiment , researchers studied the behavior of violent persons in hospitals and jails . After being confined in rooms painted pink , the inmates became calm and relaxed-even inmates who were colorblind . Photograph Photograph // How can it be that blind and colorblind persons respond to color as do fully sighted persons ? You could spend a long time thinking in a blue room and still not come up with the answer to this puzzle , so here 's some help . The main function of the retina in the eye is to receive images . The optic nerve sends the images to the brain so we can see a red room , for example . But the retina also performs another task that does n't require the ability to see . It responds to the redness of the room and sends that response to the glands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our glands changes our heart rate and our rate of brain activity . And changing these rates changes how we act . Often , our behavior is largely determined by our physical state . You know you should sit still in music class . You may even want to sit still in music class . But if you 've just come from playing soccer , you probably ca n't sit still until your heart rate slows down . And if you 're in a red or orange environment , your heart rate speeds up . You 'll feel excited , even if you 're just sitting . Actually , the retina lets you feel colors as well as see colors . Photograph Photograph // The same is true of blind and colorblind persons , too . Their retinas receive the impact of a color . That impact is sent to their glands , and the glands respond . The effect of blue calms the person . The effect of red excites the person , even though his or her brain ca n't see red . Fast-food restaurants color your behavior through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used inside the restaurants ? The color is known as " eat-and-run orange " because it stimulates your appetite . You probably eat more than you normally would elsewhere . And yes , the exciting effect of the color causes you to eat faster and leave sooner . The color of the environment in which we do things can affect our success . Choose a red environment if you 're trying to get friends excited about playing baseball . But later , if you 're telling your parents about the longest home run ball you have ever hit-only trouble is , it 's in the neighbor 's kitchen with a generous sprinkling of broken window glass-better tell them in a soothing pink room that has a blue carpet and ceiling .
