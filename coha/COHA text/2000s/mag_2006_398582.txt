Section : Buffalo Sabres Paychex founder THOMAS GOLISANO remade the bankrubt Buffalo Sabres into a profitable Stanley Cup contender <p> In late October the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League were locked in a scoreless tie with the New York Islanders when , suddenly , Sabres right wing Ales Kotalik scored on a booming shot from the top of the left face-off circle , one-timing a pass from Jaroslav Spacek past Islander goalie Rick DiPietro . <p> The goal by Kotalik , one of the deadliest snipers in the league , started the Sabres on their way to a 3  --  0 victory and a record-tying tenth consecutive win in the new NHL season . With a 11  --  1 record the Sabres are a favorite to win the Stanley Cup this season . The team leads the league with 58 goals scored . " Offensively they 're head and shoulders above the rest of the league , " says Adam Proteau , an NHL Web columnist for Hockey News . <p> It is an amazing feat considering the Sabres finished last in the NHL 's Northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operating loss ( before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ) of $5.3 million on revenues of $50 million . By last season the team had made it to the playoffs , posting a profit of $4.6 million on revenues of $70 million . FORBES values the team at $149 million , 17th on our list and 45% more than two years ago when the Sabres ranked a sorry 28th . <p> Credit for this remarkable turnaround goes to an unlikely savior : the team 's owner , B. Thomas Golisano , 64 , the billionaire founder of payroll processor Paychex . Golisano , who has run unsuccessfully for New York governor three times , is a hockey neophyte . He never played the game and had attended only three hockey games prior to buying the team in April 2003 for $92 million , most of which was assumed debt . <p> " Six months before I agreed to buy them , I swore I 'd never own a sports team , " he says . " But no one stepped up to the plate for this community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he bought decidedly damaged goods . Before Golisano took charge , the Sabres were owned by John Rigas , founder and chief executive officer of cable giant Adelphia Communications . In September 2002 Rigas was indicted on federal fraud charges stemming from improper accounting at Adelphia , subsequently forcing both the company and the Sabres into bankruptcy . ( John Rigas was sentenced to 15 years but is free pending an appeal . ) <p> The NHL did its best to run the team while it looked for a buyer . But with the Sabres ' front office in disarray , the team faltered and attendance collapsed , drawing only 5,800 season ticket holders in the 2002  --  03 season , down from 9,000 the year before . <p> Golisano 's first move was to bring back the team 's former president , Lawrence Quinn , as managing partner . Known as arrogant and divisive , Quinn was an unpopular choice among some fans , but Golisano did n't care : Quinn knew how to knock heads and cut costs . Out went 118 front office jobs . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting paid for it , " says Golisano , who can be stingy himself . For the first five years at Paychex ( now with sales of $1.7 billion ) , Golisano was its only employee . <p> To help get the fans back , Quinn lowered season ticket prices to $1,160 from $1,600 and dropped per-game ticket prices from $68 to as low as $49 for a center-ice seat . Comparable seats start at $137 at a Toronto Maples Leafs game . " If we were wrong , we 'd be looking at a 25% drop in revenue and I 'd be looking for another job , " says Quinn . <p> The new pricing strategy helped expand the fan base as more parents could now afford to bring their kids to the games . Attendance rose 13% in the 2003  --  04 season , despite a mediocre 37  --  38 record , including an eight-game losing streak in December that prompted the coaches to want to trade some players . Golisano said no , make it work with what you have  --  and spend more time practicing shots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the end of the season the Sabres had risen in scoring from 29th to 6th place . <p> But that momentum faded with the NHL owners lockout that canceled the 2004  --  05 season . Player salaries had been rising faster than revenues , and owners had demanded a salary cap . The players finally acceded but not in time to salvage the season . Golisano used the lockout time wisely , holding frequent meetings with players , coaches and management " so the players were n't disenfranchised with the owner , unlike other NHL teams , " Quinn says . <p> With the new player contract came new on-ice rules aimed at making the game faster , higher-scoring and less of a street brawl . Hooking an opponent 's skate with your stick is now outlawed , as is clutching ( grabbing on to your opponent ) . The premium is now on skating  --  and speed . <p> So Golisano signed players who could flourish with that style of play , such as former Phoenix Coyotes captain Teppo Numminen , Chris Drury ( Colorado Avalanche ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team made it to the playoffs with a record of 52 wins and 30 losses , losing in the conference finals to the Carolina Hurricanes . <p> The playoff run and the team 's $31 million payroll let the Sabres , a beneficiary of the new revenue-sharing pool , clear almost $4.6 million in profit last season . They could have earned a lot more but , unlike most teams , decided against raising ticket prices during the playoffs . " The previous owners jacked up prices for the Stanley Cup playoffs , and the community had a ripped-off feeling . We wanted to negate that , " explains Golisano , who has poured roughly $20 million into the team for working capital . <p> The fans ' goodwill has carried over to this season and season ticket sales increased 69% , to 14,860 . Night and Day <p> The Sabres ' fortunes have improved dramatically since Golisano purchased the team in 2003 .
