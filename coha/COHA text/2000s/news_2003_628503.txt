<p> ORLANDO , Fla. - Civilian members of the board investigating the shuttle Columbia disaster - outsiders who were added to reassure Congress and the public that the board would be fully independent of the space agency - are actually being paid executive-level salaries by NASA . <p> The agency quietly put the five civilians on the NASA payroll , at pay rates of $ 134,000 a year to take advantage of provisions that allow boards composed exclusively of " federal employees " to conduct business in secret . <p> If the civilians had not been hired by NASA , a federal law would have required the investigating board to meet publicly , justify any closed-door sessions and keep transcripts and minutes that would become public records . <p> Each of the 13 board members is now classified as a federal employee . Besides the five civilians and chairman , other members include four active-duty military officers , two federal transportation officials and a NASA executive . And as a result , the board says it is legally permitted to meet in secret and promise " confidentiality " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals it has interviewed . <p> Last Tuesday , board chairman Harold Gehman said transcripts of these interviews will be kept secret from the general public , and even from Congress . Said Gehman , a retired admiral who is being paid at the rate of $ 142,500 per year : " Those are never going to see the light of day . " <p> He elaborated in a written statement Friday night : " The board determined it could provide a much deeper and richer review of NASA policies and procedures if it employed standard safety investigation procedures , which are incompatible with ( open-government ) provisions . " <p> The statement did not respond to a question about his pay . <p> Gehman 's insistence on confidentiality has rankled members of Congress , who say the board 's report - now expected in July - must be accompanied by the documents that drove the conclusions . And public-policy critics say the salaries call into question whether the board is truly independent from NASA . <p> " Three words - conflict of interest , " said Steven Aftergood , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Scientists . <p> Each of Gehman 's five civilian board members insists that accepting money from NASA has in no way compromised the investigation . And indeed , board members and Gehman have been publicly critical of the space agency and its management " culture , " questioning whether it has paid adequate attention to maintenance of the aging shuttle fleet and tolerated potentially unsafe conditions . <p> But one of those five , ex-astronaut Sally Ride , acknowledges the public may see the board differently . <p> " I do n't see it an issue for the board members to be on the federal payroll - this board , unlike most pro-bono government committees , is essentially a full-time job ( for which people should receive some compensation ) , " Ride wrote in an e-mail to the Orlando Sentinel last week . " But one might ask whether it should be NASA 's payroll . " <p> The Columbia Accident Investigation Board , as it is now known , was controversial almost from the moment of its creation : 9:30 a.m . CST on Feb. 1 , 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killing its crew of seven . <p> That 's when NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe activated the " Space Shuttle Mishap Interagency Investigation Board , " part of a contingency plan created by NASA in 1995 . The seven-member board was to consist of four top military aviation and safety officials , two civilians from the Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Transportation , and a NASA employee . O'Keefe announced on Feb. 2 the addition of Gehman as its chairman . <p> The 1995 plan spelled out how the board would operate . Related NASA procedures include granting a " privilege " of confidentiality to witnesses , meeting in private and seeking the cause of an accident - not whom to blame . It was modeled after accident safety investigation procedures used by the military . <p> " If you really want to get to the bottom of an accident and its causes , you want a witness to feel like what they say is not going to be in a headline or a court of law , " said Bryan O'Connor , a former astronaut who is now head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want them to know it will only be used to prevent future mishaps , not to fire them . " <p> O'Keefe 's announcement came under immediate criticism , not because of the board 's secrecy provisions but because of concerns it was too closely tied to NASA . <p> " The fact of the matter is , so far the commission that 's there now was appointed by NASA , is staffed by NASA and reports back to NASA , and I 'm afraid that 's just not going to be credible , " said Rep. Bart Gordon of Tennessee , ranking Democrat on the House Space subcommittee , in comments echoed by members of both parties . <p> O'Keefe acted quickly , changing the board 's charter so that it no longer reported directly to him . Then , Gehman began adding other civilian board members . <p> NASA " has taken the necessary steps , " O'Keefe told a congressional committee on Feb. 27 , " to ensure the board 's complete independence . " <p> But there was something that O'Keefe did n't tell Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to conduct the military-style investigation envisioned in the NASA policy . Gehman , a retired Navy admiral , was initially the board 's only civilian appointee . He was put on the government 's payroll Feb. 2 . <p> And Gehman , who chaired a military investigation into the 2000 terrorist bombing of the destroyer USS Cole , wanted the Columbia board to operate the same way . So every subsequent civilian appointee was put on NASA 's payroll , again without publicity . <p> The reason was an obscure law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act , which requires appointed boards and commissions to publicly advertise their meetings , whether open or closed ; to keep minutes of all sessions ; and generally make their records available to the public . <p> But boards are exempt from that act if they are made up of full-time federal employees . And from the early days of the board , Gehman has said , he did n't want to operate under the act 's rules . <p> That meant making sure every board member was a " federal employee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million congressional appropriation to fund the investigation into the Columbia tragedy , gave each of the new members a " NASA excepted service appointment " for up to one year , at a salary rate of $ 134,000 , or about $ 500 per day worked . <p> Roger Tetrault , who retired in 2000 as chairman of McDermott International , said he initially offered to work for free - but was told he had to be paid . <p> " As I recall , we had to be designated as a Safety Investigation to preserve witness privilege , which we thought was essential to getting individuals to open up to us , " he wrote in an e-mail response to the Sentinel last week . <p> Eric Glitzenstein , a Washington , D.C. , public interest lawyer who has won several suits involving challenges to the advisory committee act , said the action " seems to be an obvious effort to subvert the ( FACA ) statute . <p> " You do n't point to a board of full-time federal employees and say you 're having an independent review . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's that they used that to get around the statute - and public accountability . " <p> NASA , however , insists that the decision to make board members government employees merely was to enable the board to carry out the 1995 NASA contingency plan . <p> In a statement issued by NASA chief spokesman Glenn Mahone on Friday , the agency declared : " Ignoring a fully functional federal employment structure seemed neither a timely or desirable solution - especially in the face of a validated contingency plan for just such an emergent situation . " <p> It 's not unusual for some government boards to pay their members . The panel set up as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States , also known at the 9/11 Commission , provides $ 134,000-a-year pay rates for its 10 members , plus expenses , though a spokesman said some decline the pay . <p> But many see the Gehman board as more comparable to the presidential commission ordered by then-President Reagan in 1986 , when the shuttle Challenger broke up 73 seconds after liftoff . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presidential charter , with high-profile chairman William Rogers , who had been secretary of state and attorney general . It held a series of public hearings at which NASA executives were questioned under oath about their decisions to allow the shuttle to fly despite known failures in the O-rings in the solid rocket boosters . <p> In the end , it won praise for exposing flaws in the solid rocket boosters - and inadequate safety practices by NASA 's management . <p> Challenger commission member Robert Hotz said the commission did most of its work in public - with sworn testimony - forcing witnesses to either be uncomfortably honest or commit perjury . <p> " And they chose to be uncomfortable , " Hotz said . " Secret testimony is bull  --  in an accident investigation . Space is not an in-house thing . It 's a public thing , a non-military thing .
