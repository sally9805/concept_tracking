<p> Come midnight , the college football landscape will look a whole lot different , following seven games pitting two Top 25 teams against each other . With the first big Saturday of the season here , we take a quick look at who  --  and what  --  will be in the spotlight today . <p> URBAN MEYER , FLORIDA COACH <p> The challenge : Win a big SEC game on the road . <p> Opportunity No. 1 comes today against Tennessee in Knoxville and will be followed by trips to Auburn ( Oct. 14 ) and Tallahassee ( Nov. 25 ) . <p> Meyer , who has a track record of being tough to beat in his second year at a school , still has n't shown Florida fans his teams can win away from " The Swamp . " All three of the Gators ' losses last season were on the road  --  at LSU , at Alabama , at South Carolina . <p> Today marks Meyer 's first trip to Neyland Stadium as Florida coach . He has been there once before , while an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive place , great fan support , a lot like our own stadium , " Meyer said . " The University of Tennessee is one of the most talented , if not the most talented , team in the SEC . " <p> NEBRASKA FANS <p> The challenge : Turn the Los Angeles Coliseum into Cornhusker Central and will Nebraska to a win against Southern Cal . <p> Reports out of Nebraska have as many as 30,000 ' Huskers fans finding their way to the Coliseum today . More than 300 of them apparently bought Trojans season tickets so they 'd be assured of a seat for this game . Some have predicted it will be like Nebraska 's 2000 trip to Notre Dame when 30,000 red-clad fans somehow got tickets . <p> Why is the Cornhusker nation so excited ? After several years in relative obscurity , Nebraska feels it has finally turned the corner under coach Bill Callahan , the former coach of the Oakland Raiders . This , they feel , will be the year the Cornhuskers win the Big 12 North and get back into the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huskers have come should arrive tonight when Nebraska takes on a 2-0 Trojans team off to a flying start . <p> " It will be a great test to see where we 're at and how we measure up , " Callahan said . " We know where Southern Cal is . No one has recruited better than they have the last four or five years . This program was there under Coach Tom Osborne , and we 're trying to get it back there again . " <p> OKLAHOMA <p> The challenge : Prove it 's back to being a national power after less-than-impressive wins over UAB ( 24-17 ) and Washington ( 24-10 ) . <p> A victory at No. 18 Oregon today would go a long way toward accomplishing that . <p> The Sooners were part of the national championship conversation until quarterback Rhett Bomar was kicked off the team in August . Even then , they started the season No. 10 in the Associated Press poll . But after a seven-point win against UAB , pollsters dropped OU five spots . <p> " This team has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If the Sooners can win at Autzen Stadium , one of the toughest venues west of the Mississippi , it 's a good bet they 'll be 4-0 when they head to Dallas to meet No. 8 Texas on Oct. 7 . Oklahoma hosts Middle Tennessee State next week , then has an open date . <p> Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops believes this kind of non-conference game is good , but only if you win it . <p> " People might pat you on the back and write something nice , " Stoops said , " but at the end of the year people are just going to count up wins . " <p> TOMMY BOWDEN , CLEMSON COACH <p> The challenge : Find a way to win Bowden Bowl VIII despite three devastating injuries to his own defense . <p> With 17 starters back , this was the year many thought Clemson would break through and take the ACC 's Atlantic division . That task got tougher a week ago , when the Tigers lost a game ( 34-33 in double overtime at Boston College ) and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linebackers Tremaine Billie ( broken foot ) and Anthony Waters ( torn ACL ) are n't expected to return . Doctors say Hamlin is out at least 4-6 weeks . <p> " In 30 years as a coach , I do n't think I 've seen as bad a situation with injuries this early in the season , " Tommy Bowden said . " Two of those guys Billie and Waters were two of our most vocal leaders . Now I 've got freshmen and redshirt freshmen looking around for a spark and they do n't see it . " <p> Tommy Bowden is 2-5 against his father Bobby 's Florida State teams , but neither win came in Tallahassee , site of today 's showdown . A second consecutive loss , and the Tigers would be all but eliminated from the ACC championship game mix by mid-September . <p> THE BIG EAST <p> The challenge : Show it belongs with the Big Ten , the Big 12 and the other big boys of the BCS . <p> The Big East took its share of national hits when Miami , Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the conference known for its basketball got some positive pigskin press when West Virginia knocked off SEC champion Georgia in the Sugar Bowl in January . <p> Today comes another chance to prove the news of its demise as a football conference has been a bit exaggerated . A Louisville win over Miami could give the Big East two top 10 teams  --  and provide a little redemption against a school that decided to leave for what it perceived to be greener pastures . <p> " I 'm sure it is a big deal to some of the people who were in the conference with them , " said Louisville coach Bobby Petrino , whose school joined the Big East last season . <p> Here 's another reason why Louisville-Miami is big for the Big East : The Cardinals and West Virginia meet Nov. 2 , and the Big East desperately wants both teams to be undefeated so the winner can stake a claim to a spot in the BCS championship game . <p> JAMARCUS RUSSELL , LSU QUARTERBACK <p> The challenge : Silence his critics by steering LSU to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt LSU 's junior is as physically gifted as they come in the SEC . But the rap on Russell is that he sometimes relies on his incredible talent too much and forces the ball into coverages . <p> The defensive book on Russell : If you can put enough pressure on him , he 'll make mistakes . Auburn 's defense , with new coordinator Will Muschamp , intends to do exactly that today when the two SEC West teams hook up at 3:30 p.m . <p> NO PLACE LIKE THE ROAD <p> LSU enters today 's game at Auburn having won seven consecutive road games : <p> Date ... Opponent ... Score <p> Nov. 19 , 2005 .. at Ole Miss ... 40-7 <p> Nov. 12 , 2005 .. at No. 3 Alabama ... 16-13 ( OT ) <p> Oct. 8 , 2005 ... at Vanderbilt ... 34-6 <p> Oct. 1 , 2005 ... at Miss .

Two years ago as a redshirt freshman , he came off the bench in the fourth quarter vs. the third-ranked ' Canes and completed 7 of 12 passes . The Cardinals led late but Miami rallied to win 41-38 . <p> " They are fast and very physical . You have to make decisions quick , " Brohm said . " I think that 2004 experience can only help me . " <p> LLOYD CARR , MICHIGAN COACH <p> The challenge : Give fans a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . <p> A win today at No. 3 Notre Dame would provide plenty of relief for Carr , who has come under fire since the Wolverines went 7-5 last season and lost to Ohio State for the fourth time in the past five meetings . <p> Another disturbing stat that Carr is particularly touchy about : Michigan has lost six consecutive road openers since 2000 . When asked about that during a conference call this week , there was only silence at the end of the line . <p> When asked again , Carr said : " I think it 's a combination of things , and hopefully we 'll find the answer .
