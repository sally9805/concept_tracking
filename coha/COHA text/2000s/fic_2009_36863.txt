Babies First <p> <p> As it brushed the river , the dawn breeze grabbed Reiffen 's cloak . Around him the blankets of the dead and dying fluttered . Those still alive coughed wetly , low and thick from bloody lungs . <p> <p> He refused to look at them . Any of them . If even a single blanket fell aside from one of those wretched faces , he might have to notice what he 'd done . Already flies hovered , their hum thick and throbbing as a hive 's . A sweet stink clung to the air , though there had n't been enough time yet for the dead to start rotting . <p> <p> Knowing the smell would seek the low ground by the river , he climbed the bank in search of cleaner air . The rows of the dead stretched into the fog around him ; after a few steps he no longer had any idea where he was . His feet kicked up cinders from the burnt earth until the air was as thick with charred dirt as it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A spotted glow rose from the ground . The dead had opened their eyes . <p> <p> They did n't reach for him : Reiffen 's nightmare was n't that simple . Reliving their last moments , his victims crouched on their knees and vomited at his feet . Blood and rheum spilled across his boots , soaking the earth like rain . His stomach churned . Other corpses appeared , sissit as well as men , crawling out of the fog to press against their fellows . Perhaps Reiffen could have forced his way through the hunched , crooked crowd , but , whether from pity or revulsion , he could n't bring himself to touch them . The dead , too , kept their careful distance , crouching on hands and knees . Broken jaws retched rotting teeth ; cracked lips oozed black blood . Spittle foamed at their chins . <p> <p> He decided to flee , but found he could n't . Though his boots had barely sunk halfway into the mud , the ground gripped them with frozen strength . His alarm increased as he struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper . <p> <p> A young woman stumbled out of the mist , her dress tattered . " Help me , " she cried . <p> <p> Was it Ferris ? Reiffen 's fear gripped his throat . But the woman was too thin , her hair too wild . Her eyes were blue instead of brown . The fog swallowed her like a leaping nokken as she ran away , her dress streaming behind her . <p> <p> The Black Wizard followed , towering higher than the trees . Only the Wizard did n't charge angrily after the woman as Reiffen expected , but started toward Reiffen instead . Corpses of men and sissit burst in gouts of pus and pale skin at the giant 's every step . But his color lightened as he came closer , his robes turning from black to gray as the quickening wind flicked away the ash . Not Ossdonc , after all , but Fornoch . The one among the Three whom Reiffen had n't been able to slay . <p> <p> Gobbets of earth splashed around him as Reiffen scrabbled to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as foul as someone else 's bile , and choked as he tried to breathe . The mud gulped him down , waist and chest and shoulders , till his eyes were at the level of the Wizard 's enormous ankle . Clean toes showed at the edge of a spotless sandal . Fingers reached down for Reiffen 's face . <p> <p> " Take my hand , " said the Wizard . " Your time has not yet come . " <p> <p> To be saved again by Fornoch was more than Reiffen could bear . And it felt so good to give up , to let his whole body relax and accept the sinking . To forget about all the things he was supposed to do , all the things his mother and everyone else expected from him . To leave the magic behind . He let his chin dip into the cold sludge . Mud and blood seeped between his lips . Soft paste swallowed his eyes . <p> <p> The Gray Wizard 's thick fingernails gouged Reiffen 's scalp as he grabbed him by the hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he warned , his words hammering down like pellets of lead . Reiffen was drawn out of the earth with a loud pop . " Not for you . " <p> <p> The Wizard paused . Reiffen 's fear sprouted like a licking flame . <p> <p> " Nor for your daughter , either . " <p> <p> He woke with his heart pounding . Throwing off the blankets , he scrambled out of bed onto the cold dirt floor . Sandy , thinking it was time to play , pattered over to sniff his master 's knees . <p> <p> " Are you all right ? " Ferris sat up in the bed , her voice cutting the darkness . <p> <p> " I 'm fine , " Reiffen said . <p> <p> " You do n't look fine . Was it the dream about Rimwich again ? " <p> <p> " Yes . " <p> <p> " There 's still some milk left from yesterday . I 'll heat it for you . " <p> <p> " I said I was fine . " <p> <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outline of her face in the fire-glow , he caught Ferris 's irritation easily enough . Which reassured him greatly . Some things never changed . <p> <p> " If you think you can have a nightmare that bad without talking to me about it , " she said , " then I 'm going home to Valing right now . " <p> <p> " You ca n't cast the traveling spell on your own . " <p> <p> " I 'm sure you 're gentleman enough to take me , if I ask . " She patted the empty spot on the bed . " It 'll be easier for both of us if you come back and let me make you feel better . " <p> <p> Checking to make sure the owl he had set to stand watch in the woods outside had noticed nothing unusual , Reiffen allowed his wife to pull him back into the comfort of the covers . Already the late-summer nights in the northern forest were as cold as a Valing fall . <p> <p> " Not you , Sandy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tried to scramble up beside them . <p> <p> Wrapped in his wife 's arms , Reiffen told her about his dream . Except for the part at the end , when Fornoch had mentioned a child . <p> <p> " I wish I 'd never done any of it , " he said . <p> <p> Soft breath caressed his ear . " It was war . Ossdonc and his army would have killed us all if you had n't stopped them . " <p> <p> " I know . But there 's no honor in killing men , or sissit , in their sleep . " <p> <p> " As far as I 'm concerned , there 's no honor in killing anyone , ever . Sometimes it 's just something you have to do . The Wizards would n't have thought twice about it . " <p> <p> " I did n't learn magic in order to be a Wizard . " <p> <p> " And you are n't . A magician , maybe , but not a Wizard . Believe me , no one thinks less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought you 'd done it very cleverly . " <p> <p> " Redburr is n't human . He does n't understand . " <p> <p> " That does n't mean he is n't right . " <p> <p> " It does n't mean he understands , either . You have no idea what that night was like . No one does . All those people , with no idea what was happening to them . I killed them all so easily . Sometimes I wish there was a way I could go back and undo everything . Too bad the traveling spell wo n't work for time as well as place . " <p> <p> " I know you 'd make everything better if you could , dear heart . " Ferris kissed his cheek softly . " It 's one of the reasons I love you , and why you should n't feel so guilty . But the main thing is no one 's going to bother Banking and Wayland again any time soon . The Keeadini are back across the Westing , scared to death you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wizards ' army . And there was talk in Malmoret before I left that Cuspor has already pledged never to attack another Banking ship . " <p> <p> " Lovely . " Bitterness edged Reiffen 's voice . " The world 's at peace because everyone 's afraid I 'll kill them . Meanwhile Fornoch , who 's the real danger , is still out there somewhere dreaming up who knows what wickedness . For all we know , he 's found another child to teach everything he taught me . " <p> <p> " Then maybe we should get to work . " Ferris threw the blanket off her shoulders and sat up . Her long hair danced free in the firelight , frosting her skin . " The quicker you teach me magic , the quicker there will be two of us to stand against them . " <p> <p> Laughing at the way she waved her hands while pretending to cast spells , Reiffen pulled her down beside him . He liked the way she never flinched at the touch of his thimbles . As he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " or I 'll think you 're too eager . Magic is a sacred trust , not to be granted lightly . " <p> <p> " Fiddle . " Ferris slapped her husband 's chest playfully . " I 'd never have dragged you back to Valing for Father to marry us if I thought you were n't going to teach me magic . After the way you held off Usseis all by yourself , I 'm sure the two of us will defeat Fornoch easily . " <p> <p> " In an open fight , yes . But fighting Fornoch in the open is n't what worries me . That 's exactly the sort of thing he 'll most avoid . More likely he 'll try to set us against each another . " <p> <p> " As if that could ever happen . " <p> <p> Later , after Ferris had finally driven the nightmare from his mind , she rested on her side while Reiffen snuggled behind her , his arm around her waist . Her belly felt warm and smooth beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the end of his pinky . <p> <p> " Where shall we live , dear heart ? " he asked . <p> <p> " Is there any question ? " she murmured . " Valing , of course . " <p> <p> " I do n't think that would work at all . " <p> <p> She rolled around to face him . " You know perfectly well everyone 's forgiven you , now they know Skimmer and Rollby are safe . And Icer 's forgotten his burns completely . " <p> <p> " Only because he 's moved in with Old Mortin on the lower dock . The two of them are starting to make Redburr look like an abstainer . " <p> <p> " That 's right . " Ferris poked Reiffen gently on the nose with the tip of her finger . " You do have that to answer for , dearest . " <p> <p> " Yes , and I 'd like to keep nokken drunkenness the vilest thing I can be blamed for in Valing . Which might not be the case if we bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract the best sort of people . " <p> <p> " We 've already discussed that . We 're going to choose our apprentices only from people who want to do good . Even if we make mistakes , we 'll weed out the bad ones . " <p> <p> " I 'd still rather establish ourselves somewhere where we hurt as few people as possible . Grangore , perhaps , where we 'll be close to the Dwarves . And there 's another thing . " <p> <p> Sitting up , Reiffen retrieved a small pouch from the pile of clothes at the foot of the bed . Sandy 's head poked up hopefully as a shadow before the fire . <p> <p> " We have to discuss this as well . " He poured a small , glowing stone out of the bag and into his hand . Not nearly as bright as a Dwarf lamp , the gem pulsed like Ferris 's moonstone necklace . But the throbs of blue color that came from Reiffen 's stone were as regular as heartbeats , where the moonstones flickered wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone faded slowly , the light retreating . But even at its brightest the glow was only enough to cast a dark blue shadow on his hand . <p> <p> " I 've been meaning to give you this for several days , " he said . <p> <p> " What is it ? " <p> <p> " Ca n't you guess ? " <p> <p> The stone 's throbbing quickened as Ferris reached for it . The color brightened , too . She drew her hand back , afraid she 'd done something wrong , and the pace of the throbbing ebbed . Reiffen grinned , the same way he had when they were children and he 'd just proven his cleverness by swiping cake from Hern 's kitchen . <p> <p> " Is it something of Uhle 's ? " she asked . <p> <p> " Fashioning this is far beyond Uhle 's power . Or any other Dwarf ' s . " <p> <p> His wife 's eyes narrowed as she realized what he was offering her , and sparked in time with the flashing jewel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded . This time Ferris accepted the gem when he offered it . It glowed brighter than ever in her palm , its beating quick as her heart . Unlike the sharp facets of a Dwarf lamp , the Living Stone was like Durk , smooth as a river-rounded pebble . Its color was darker than a Dwarf lamp as well , perhaps because it put out less light . <p> <p> " Did you make it ? " she asked . <p> <p> " No . " Reiffen shook his head . " Fornoch made it . " <p> <p> Ferris handed the stone straight back to him . " I do n't want it then . " <p> <p> " He made it for you . I asked him to . " <p> <p> " And you trust him ? " <p> <p> " He made my stone . And Giserre 's . It saved her life once , as mine saved me when Usseis broke my neck . They have never done anything but what Fornoch said they would . " <p> <p> " Giserre told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> <p> Reiffen 's brows arched . " Really ? She never told me that . " <p> <p> " It 's not the sort of thing you tell your son . " With a firm gesture , Ferris folded Reiffen 's hand around his gift . Rock and thimble clicked together . " I have n't married you just for your magic , " she went on . " None of our parents will be happy if we make them wait for grandchildren . Nor will I. Hern is dying for someone to call her Mims . " <p> <p> " There will be plenty of time for that later , love . Once you 're settled into your power , the risk will be less . It is painful , but the stone can be removed . " <p> <p> Ferris waggled her thimble in the air . " Less painful than this was ? " <p> <p> " Well , maybe not . A lot more painful , actually . " <p> <p> " Then I 'd rather not . Babies first , immortality after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living Stone changes might last even when you remove it . In the meantime , we 'll work on the other part of the deal . The sooner we have a child , the sooner I 'll be ready to swallow your stone . " <p> <p> " As if we needed any fresh incentive . " <p> <p> True dawn was spilling around the edges of the blanket draped over the window when Ferris asked him another question . " I do n't suppose you know how to make these things , " she said , rolling the Living Stone across the quilts with her finger . <p> <p> " Make one ? Why would I want to do that ? " <p> <p> " For our children , of course . " <p> <p> Reiffen scowled . " I know how , but it 's not a spell I ever want to practice . Or teach . Nothing comes free in magic . The life in the stone has to come from somewhere . And someone . " <p> <p> Taking the gem from her , he cupped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use wasting it , though , now we have it . What 's done is done . " <p> <p> " But what about our children ? I do n't want to live forever only to watch them grow old . " <p> <p> " Giserre told me she 's going to give hers up the moment she gets a grandchild . She wants to look a proper grandmother as the child grows up . " <p> <p> " And our other children ? You do n't think we 're going to be happy with just one , do you ? " <p> <p> Reiffen rolled his eyes . " Let 's not get too far ahead of ourselves , love . " <p> <p> He still had n't told her what Fornoch had said to him in his dream . He was n't sure he would , either . There was always the chance their first child would n't be a daughter at all . <p> <p> Some months later , and many leagues to the south , Avender danced with Wellin in the Old Palace . Other couples swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Avender saw only the woman in his arms , her laughing mouth and eyes , and felt only the grip of her fingers on his sleeve . <p> <p> " So ? " she asked , her voice gracing the air more merrily than the music . " Is it settled ? Are you staying with Brizen in Malmoret ? " <p> <p> " Yes . " <p> <p> " And the rumors are true as well ? King Brannis has presented you with an estate in Wayland to help you make up your mind ? " <p> <p> " The estate had nothing to do with it . I tried to refuse , but the king insisted . He says no one will take me seriously at court unless I own land . It 's only a small place in East Wayland called Goose Rock . " <p> <p> " A charming name . Have you seen it ? " <p> <p> " Not yet . Want to come with me when I do ? " <p> <p> " The king would never approve . " <p> <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced toward the dais at the end of the hall . Avender followed her gaze , though he had seen it all before . The garlanded columns , the musicians on the balcony above , King Brannis glowering at the dancers parading on the marble floor . Except that always before the king 's displeasure had been directed at Ferris and his son . This time it was Avender 's turn . <p> <p> Before the dance flung them away , he saw the king gesture toward Brizen , who stood at the side of his father 's chair . The son bent amiably to listen to what Brannis said , but when the king was finished Brizen said one short , round word , and remained where he was . The king 's scowl deepened . <p> <p> " You 're right , " said Avender . " If he does n't like our dancing together , your coming to Goose Rock with me would make him even angrier . " <p> <p> " It would . But then , if you do not value the king 's gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless you have been dissembling about the value of your acquisition . " <p> <p> Had Avender 's hands not been so pleasantly occupied with Wellin 's , he would have snapped his fingers . " Your company is worth far more than a dozen Goose Rocks , and a duchy beside . " <p> <p> She smiled . Her fair hair swirled around her shoulders as she spun in her partner 's hands . Avender 's heart rose . Happily he admired her throat and the ring of bare arm that showed between the tops of her long gloves and her gown 's puffed sleeves . <p> <p> " If you flatter the king half so well as you flatter me , " she told him , " I have no doubt you will soon have that duchy to go with your farm . " <p> <p> The music stopped . Wellin curtsied demurely ; her partner answered with a bow . A dozen young men darted up from either side , all wanting to have the next dance with the most beautiful woman in Malmoret . <p> <p> Brizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective partners aside , though the warmth in her apologies enflamed them all the more . " Baron Lavinier , I know I promised you a second dance , but Avender has worn me out so completely , you must forgive me if I can not fulfill my promise now . I really do need to catch my breath . Avender , if you would be so kind as to give me your arm . I think a pass through the garden is just what I need . " <p> <p> " But the cold , my lady , " said Baron Lavinier . " It 's as bad as Rimwich . " <p> <p> " At least let me fetch your shawl , " said another . <p> <p> " I sha n't need my shawl , Dosset , but thank you all the same . This dancing has heated me enough for a snowstorm in the Bavadars . " Mustaches bristled as she rested her gloved fingers on Dosset 's arm , but the young men calmed back down when her hand returned to Avender . Everyone knew so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penniless master of Goose Rock , even if he was a hero . <p> <p> Collecting a cup of hot punch along the way , Avender escorted his prize out to the garden . Low shrubbery shadowed them like shrunken crones as they strolled along the paths . Above them the dark walls of the empty palace rose up against the night , unlit upper windows darker than the sky . Except for the occasional ball , the Old Palace was never used at all . <p> <p> " Are you sure you do n't want a shawl ? " Avender asked . <p> <p> " Thank you , no . The cool will clear my head . " <p> <p> " Baron Lavinier is right . " He rubbed his hands against the cold . " This weather does feel more like a Rimwich winter than Malmoret . When I came in , I heard a man say how , now Reiffen has renounced the throne and Brannis 's triumph is complete , he 's even brought Wayland 's weather with him to Banking . " <p> <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lifted her punch glass to her lips . Pungent spices floated past his nose . " The weather is just unusual , nothing more . Have you seen them lately ? Ferris and Reiffen , that is ? " <p> <p> " Not since we were all in Valing for the wedding , but that was months ago . I have n't been to the castle they 're building in Grangore yet . " And was unlikely to go there any time soon , he thought . Let Ferris and Reiffen have Grangore ; his life would be in Malmoret now . Malmoret had fewer regrets . <p> <p> Wellin stopped and gazed up at the clear sky . The cold seemed to have chased away everything but the stars . <p> <p> " They are very lucky , " she said with a trace of what Avender thought might be wistfulness . " Everything worked out perfectly . True love overcoming all obstacles , just as the poets describe . It is too bad not everyone can be so lucky . " <p> <p> " It certainly is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the spying shrubbery nearly turn away in shame . When she turned to face him , her dark eyes burned . " As if you would ever have any trouble on that score . Do you have any idea how marvelous it is , dancing with you ? You are the handsomest man in the room . " <p> <p> Avender 's heart quickened . Ferris had once told him that Wellin thought him handsome , but he had hardly expected to hear it from the woman herself . Especially now Brizen was back on the marriage market . But Avender was n't someone who repeated his mistakes and , though he had never told Ferris how he felt , he had seen what had happened when Brizen had . How , despite Ferris 's hating the prince the first time they met , she had almost ended up marrying him . And would have married him , too , had it not turned out that Reiffen was on their side all along in the fight against the Wizards . <p> <p> Given the look in her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Brizen had ever had with Ferris . " If I 'm the best-looking man in the room , " he said , " you 're easily the best-looking woman . In Malmoret . In Banking . In the entire world . " <p> <p> She met his glance steadily , her face a pale oval in the darkness . He laid his hand on her shoulder as he bent to kiss her and found her skin smoother than Skimmer 's fur . And warmer , too , despite the courtyard 's cold . <p> <p> Tapping him sharply with her fan , she twirled away . " I thought you understood , " she said . <p> <p> " You mean I do n't ? " <p> <p> " My cap is set for Brizen . You know that . " She examined him straightforwardly with the same dark eyes that had smitten him a moment before , her fan now lying against the swell of her lower lip . <p> <p> " But Brizen has n't been paying any attention to you at all . And you seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> <p> " I have enjoyed your compliments . Very much . And Brizen has paid attention to no one . But that will change . He is only a man , after all , just like you . If you can get over Ferris , I am certain Prince Brizen can as well . When he does , I , for one , am certainly not going to let a second chance slip away . " <p> <p> Avender 's hands suddenly felt cold . He pushed them into his pockets . " If you 've been paying me compliments you do n't mean , it 's cruel . " <p> <p> " Oh , I mean them . " <p> <p> Wellin smiled again , a sly , honest smile that Avender felt as keenly as the kiss he would have preferred . " I mean them very much . But I am not in love with you and , if you try too hard to make me so , I shall have to throw you over entirely . The temptation would be too much . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirting with you more than anyone else  --  it is much more pleasant . Not to mention the fact that Brizen would not be the first man to notice a woman only after she has been noticed by someone else . " <p> <p> " That 's hardly fair to me . " <p> <p> " No . But you can not accuse me of leading you on , as I have stated my intentions plainly . If you still wish to dance with me , and promenade in moonlit gardens  --  " <p> <p> Raising his hands in frustration , Avender gestured at the empty sky . " What moon ? " <p> <p> Wellin laughed , accepting his small joke as a sign he had finished his sulk . " There will be other nights , I assure you , before Brizen gets over his broken heart . He is a good man , and loves truly . I doubt I could bring myself to marry him were he not . But , as I was saying , if you continue to flirt with me , which I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility , not mine . And who knows ? I might even fail to catch Prince Brizen 's eye a second time , at which point I will require a great deal of consoling . Though by then I should not be at all surprised if you had moved on to someone less cruel . " <p> <p> " At least you 're aware of the damage you 're doing . " <p> <p> " Oh , I am quite aware . " She gave him another cool glance , more intense than the first . " And of the damage to myself as well . I have meant every compliment I have given you as much as you have meant yours . I hope you will forgive me if I do not permit myself to go further . " <p> <p> She smiled again , a different sort of smile that revealed more of conspiratorial friendship than private desire . Then she laid her hand sweetly on his chest . " Now that we have that straightened out , I think it might be time to return to the ballroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brannis and the rest of the room will not . I think they would all appreciate the sight of us dancing together again , now we have both cooled . " <p> <p> Bold as ever , Wellin swept her skirts loudly across the floor as she led Avender back into the King 's Hall . Every dowager turned to scowl at them , and Brannis showed his annoyance as well . But if Prince Brizen noticed the couple 's return , he did n't show it . <p> <p> For the rest of that season Wellin offered Avender as much attention as she dared . Once she went so far as to share several quick , deep , kisses with him behind a willow on a spring afternoon when the Duchess of Winkling thought an outing with boats would be fun . Perhaps it was the kissing that did it , though Avender was certain no one had seen them , but it was n't much later that Wellin had no time for anyone but the prince . And even though Avender had thought himself prepared , the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no regrets . Her wedding was even grander than Ferris 's had almost been the summer before : this time the king approved of the match as much as his son . Ferris and Reiffen were unable to attend , as Ferris was due that fall , but everyone else was present , from Valing to Issinlough . Avender watched it all from Brizen 's side , though he would much rather have been banished to the top of White Tooth in the Bavadars . For the last month he had been seriously considering throwing off his allegiance to the prince and seeking his fortune with the Dwarves . To have lost a second woman to a second friend seemed more than sufficient reason to vanish from the human portion of the world . But he soon discovered other advantages to serving at the royal court , especially once the other unmarried ladies understood Wellin no longer blocked their way to the handsomest man in Malmoret . And some of the married ones as well . <p> <p> Excerpted from The Magicians Daughter by S.C . Butler Copyright 2009 by S.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associates , LLC
