<p> Bill Gates is handing Microsoft 's CEO title to Steve Ballmer so Gates can be chairman and chief software architect . In one sense , that 's momentous . Gates has been the only CEO in mighty Microsoft 's 25 years . An era is slipping past . <p> But it 's not going to alter much for Microsoft employees , shareholders or competitors  --  not even for the Department of Justice antitrust case against the company . And do n't think for a second that Microsoft is going to be a different kind of place . <p> In fact , that little title shift is akin to Microsoft pulling back the rubber band on a huge slingshot , loading it up and aiming it at the Internet industry . Microsoft has big plans for changing the way software is sold , making the Internet more " programmable " and opening up and redesigning Windows so it can work on anything with a computer chip . And Gates is getting himself and his company in position to launch those plans . <p> " Internally , this feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Jon Staenberg , a former Microsoft employee and now a venture capitalist in Seattle . " This will be a big bet , but a necessary bet . " <p> In 1995 , the company dramatically changed directions , embraced the Net and almost immediately became a major force in the industry . Throughout the press conference Thursday , Gates , 44 , and Ballmer , 43 , kept referring obliquely to an April " strategy day " when Microsoft will lay out its road map for the next age . As Ballmer said , " Stand by for news . " <p> The quip might indicate that Ballmer did n't consider the job changes to be big news . To some extent , they were n't . <p> On a cheesy little stage , Gates  --  in a white shirt , open at the neck , and blue V-neck sweater , and with his hair gelled a little more than usual  --  first got up and talked about how Microsoft is facing a time of incredible challenges that the company must meet . Then , he abruptly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take on a new role as CEO of Microsoft . I 'll take on a new role that will allow me to spend 100% of my time on new technologies . I 'll be chairman and chief software architect . It 's an exciting evolution for me and a good transition for the company . " <p> He introduced Ballmer , who strolled up wearing a blue , open-neck shirt and dark jacket . Gates congratulated him in that awkward way one brother might tell another brother he loves him . Ballmer took the stage and it was a done deal . <p> Expect little change <p> Ballmer will officially run the day-to-day operations inside Microsoft . He 's really been doing that since mid-1998 , when he was named president . At different times , he 's run almost every piece of Microsoft . He 's extremely close to Gates . They act as alter egos . While Gates is more dry and cerebral , Ballmer is gung-ho and tactile . " Bill Gates has a tremendous amount of confidence in Steve , and so do employees and shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ballmer at Microsoft and is now CEO of ShopNow.com . " This is a natural evolution for him . " <p> Adds Andrew Roskill , former Microsoft employee and analyst at Warburg Dillon Read : " Ballmer definitely has the fire in his belly . He 's an incredible team builder ; an incredible sales builder . " <p> Does the job change mean Gates will be less of a force in or out of Microsoft ? Says Staenberg , rather vehemently : " NO ! That 's just not the case at all . " <p> Gates will still be Microsoft 's heart and soul . There 's no way he ca n't be , no matter how much he tries to deflect speaking engagements and press inquiries to Ballmer . The Microsoft troops will always look to Gates for inspiration and guidance . He 's their George Washington , their Martin Luther King . That wo n't go away because of an altered title . <p> Gates , though , will officially divorce himself from the operational meetings , the budgets and the other grinding aspects of running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he likes best : thinking of overall strategy and messing directly with technology . Says Gates : " I enjoyed being CEO . However , what I really enjoy most and am getting back to is working with the product groups . Making the big bets . We 're being pretty ruthless about looking at where my time is going , to make sure that happens . " <p> Timing logic <p> Why do this now ? Some speculate the timing is related to ongoing negotiations between Microsoft and Justice . Because Gates came to personify Microsoft 's behavior during the trial , " this could be a mild plus for negotiations , " says antitrust expert William Kovacic . Yet other experts say the move is irrelevant to the case . <p> When Gates was asked if the move had anything to do with the talks , he barked , " This has nothing to do with that . " <p> There are other reasons for the timing . Much of Microsoft has been jamming to finish Windows 2000 , which is done and ready to launch Feb. 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that push . But he also wanted to make the change before the April strategy day so Microsoft would be ready to charge ahead after that . <p> Gates and Ballmer talked with gusto about Microsoft 's need to gallop into this next phase . As Gates nodded and smiled , Ballmer said : " Now is the time to seize this critical opportunity . Letting Bill focus 100% of his time on what it takes to make that happen is absolutely critical . " <p> Here 's what Gates is seeing out there : <p> The era of big , smart , software-laden PCs  --  Microsoft 's golden era  --  connecting to a pretty passive Internet is ending . Next comes an era of many different devices , often with tiny bits of software , connecting to an Internet that 's loaded with software . <p> " It 's critical over the next several years that Microsoft lay down the right strategy in terms of its product designs in order to really respond to that shift , " says William Epifanio , analyst at J.P . Morgan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) lines . He 's a visionary and a tremendous designer , and he wants to completely focus his time and attention on this . " <p> Gates and Ballmer talked some about Microsoft 's tack : <p> * Software will become more of a service and less of a prepackaged box . Devices will connect through networks to big server computers where most of the software is stored and the computing gets done . Microsoft has moved slowly to make its applications , such as Excel , available this way , but it must move faster . " Our revenue streams will be a bit of a hybrid , " Gates says . " Different than what we have now . " <p> * The Net will become programmable . Microsoft wants to make software that can reside inside any Web site and also in devices or PCs . The software will allow anything to work together much like software works together in a single PC . One example : You make a flight reservation on a travel site and it knows to update your calendar in your PC and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoot an e-mail to a preset list telling people where you 'll be . <p> * Microsoft must seriously commit to making an operating system that can work on any device . Its Windows CE , ostensibly for consumer electronics , is flailing , largely because Microsoft has taken a PC mentality to develop CE , unable to give up the ghost of its heritage . " The world is not about PCs anymore , " investor Staenberg says . " And now Microsoft is really saying that . " <p> Microsoft 's next stage might also be defined by what it 's not . While Microsoft says it will need a lot of partners in the new world , Gates and Ballmer say the company will not go out buying media companies , &agrave; la America Online buying Time Warner this week . " I see our key role as focusing on software , " Gates says . That might be taken as a recommitment to Microsoft 's core . <p> If you 're a Microsoft competitor hoping that ultra-tough , ultra-cagey Gates is ready for the rocking chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here . One thing was clear Thursday : Gates does not sound like a guy ready for a breather . As he said at one point : " The excitement of my career is still very much in front of me .
