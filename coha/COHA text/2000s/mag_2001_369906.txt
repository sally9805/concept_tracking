The opening scenes of Amy Wilentz 's first novel , Martyrs ' Crossing ( Simon &; Schuster ; 311 pages ; $24 ) , seem transcribed from this morning 's Middle East bulletins . In response to terrorist bombings in Jerusalem , Israel has barred West Bank Palestinians from entering the city . One rainy evening Marina Hajimi approaches the Shuhada checkpoint on the Ramallah road with her young son Ibrahim . He is suffering an asthma attack , and his Palestinian doctor has told her to get him quickly to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem . The Israeli army lieutenant in charge , Ari Doron , sees that the boy is in bad shape and frantically telephones higher-ups for permission to let him and his mother through . After agonizing delays , Doron 's request is denied , but he decides to disobey the order . By then it is too late ; Ibrahim dies in a waiting ambulance . <P> Innocent casualties have a brief news life ; others are sure to follow . But Wilentz , a former TIME writer who served as Jerusalem correspondent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction to examine an event that is both achingly personal and inescapably political through the minds of the people most affected by it . Good journalists do n't claim to know what their subjects are thinking ; good novelists do so for a living . <P> Ibrahim Hajimi is not , it turns out , just another Palestinian child . His father Hassan is a charismatic firebrand currently in detention in Jerusalem for suspected terrorist acts . And the boy 's maternal grandfather is George Raad , a Boston cardiologist and internationally known Palestinian advocate . The death of a little boy so prominently connected offers a chance for some effective anti-Israel propaganda . To neutralize that very thing , Colonel Daniel Yizhar of West Bank security briefs Lieutenant Doron on what will be the official army version of the checkpoint episode . The story is mostly accurate but omits , Doron notes , the long period he spent on the phone waiting for an answer . He refuses to go along . " You believe nothing bad happened , " he tells Yizhar . " I believe we killed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resents the attempt to turn Ibrahim into a political weapon . At a rally staged in Ramallah by the Palestinian Authority , he speaks harsh words to his hosts and the crowd : " If you want to find someone to blame for my grandson 's death , look further than the soldier who was at the checkpoint that night , look in the mirror , as well . Look at yourself and the Authority , who 've negotiated our birthright . " <P> " Endings did not happen here , " Colonel Yizhar muses at one point about Israel . But novels must end , and Wilentz resorts to a few melodramatic flourishes to tie up her story . The strength of Martyrs ' Crossing , though , is not its plotting but its authentic and persuasive portraits of people trying to find their way through , and possibly past , the traps of history . <P>  --  By Paul Gray
