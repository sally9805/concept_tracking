Joshua DeLeon admits he was " gang-banging " when he was identified by San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera as one of 32 Norteos in the Mission District who needed to be reined in . <p> When Herrera 's civil gang injunction went before a judge , DeLeon showed up in court - but only , he said , to laugh at the whole affair . <p> A year later , DeLeon says shame and God changed him . He was baptized in July and enrolled at City College , with a goal of becoming a counselor to gang members and others . <p> To Herrera , DeLeon 's story is a sign that the wide-ranging injunction has been a success . However , that is n't how DeLeon sees it . <p> Although he admits he was a gang member at the time , DeLeon , 20 , believes he was wronged when Herrera tried to drive a wedge into the Norteos by limiting members movements in a " safety zone " in the Mission . <p> The 29 men now named in the civil action - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be seen with other suspected Norteo members in the zone , even if they are cousins or brothers . Nor can they wear red , the color claimed by Norteos , or hang out on the street after 10 p.m . <p> " We ca n't go back to our neighborhood where we grew up , " said DeLeon , who now lives in Oakland and has an older brother on the injunction list . " I ca n't see my family and have a barbecue . " <p> Herrera and police gang officers see a different possible moral to DeLeon 's story . They believe the injunction may provide gang members with an antidote to peer pressure - an excuse to avoid people and situations that once brought trouble . Herrera called it the " third way . " <p> The city attorney has obtained civil injunctions against five gangs since 2007 . But in geographic terms , the action against the Norteos was by far the broadest , extending over 60 square blocks . <p> One year after a judge signed the injunction , Herrera said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons have delivered positive results . <p> Just one man on the injunction list has been arrested for a violent crime in the last year , as the gang members lost their " cloak of anonymity , " Herrera said . Police said other young men and women in the Mission appear to have toned down their behavior in an effort to avoid the list . <p> But opponents , citing a string of seven killings in the Mission in August and September that prompted police to beef up patrols , call the injunction a failure . They say it took away basic rights , stigmatized young Latinos , wasted money and did nothing to address why youths are drawn to gangs . <p> Supervisor Tom Ammiano , whose district includes the Mission , supported the injunction . Yet a year later , he says he wants a hearing on its effectiveness after listening to frustrated residents . <p> " If my constituents are in doubt , " Ammiano said , " there 's either a lack of communication or a lack of facts . " <p> One thing that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norteos . DeLeon said he had stayed almost entirely off the streets in the " safety zone " for fear of an arrest and a sentence of up to six months . <p> Kevin Chavez , who is 23 and lives with his parents in the zone , said he has taken similar precautions since being named in Herrera 's injunction . He said that when he leaves his house , he first walks out of the zone , then continues on toward his destination . <p> " I could be walking with my cousin , and they could say he 's a gang member and take me in , " Chavez said . <p> Chavez disputed police reports that he had admitted to being a Norteo , but acknowledged that he had been in and out of jail for years . He said he was trying to go straight by quitting drugs . <p> The injunction has illuminated the depth of the Mission 's gang problem and the vigor of disagreements over how to fight it . <p> Norteos and Sureos , who claim blue , are offshoots of prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gang culture still floods the " safety zone . " Shop owners stock few items in red or blue because shoppers try to avoid both . <p> Teenagers say they are often " checked , " or asked whether they are Norteo or Sureo , a question that can carry grave consequences . Sgt. Dion McDonnell of the police gang task force said he had seen photographs where parents posed children wearing red clothing and flashing gang signs . <p> DeLeon said he had gotten into trouble because many of the older youths in his neighborhood were gang members . <p> " It seemed like it was the thing to do , the place to go , " he said . " Doing those bad things , I enjoyed it . I loved it . I had a passion for it . Doing those bad things was my fuel that kept me going . " <p> Holding up a Bible on a recent afternoon in a downtown park , DeLeon said , " Jesus has opened my eyes and shown me it 's not the way to go . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norteos , Herrera used a strategy popularized in Los Angeles and tried to build on what he saw as the success of his first injunction a year earlier . It targeted 22 men in four square blocks around the Oakdale housing project in Bayview-Hunters Point . <p> Police said crime fell there , but noted that younger men stepped into a power vacuum . Herrera said he may add more names . <p> The Mission injunction was more ambitious . Police gang Officer Mario Molina , in a court affidavit , said the city had as many as 300 Norteos who sold drugs and robbed and attacked people . <p> Herrera faced criticism from defense attorneys , including Public Defender Jeff Adachi , and gang outreach groups . They said the city attorney took advantage of some features of civil court - such as the lack of a right to an attorney at no cost - and gave police too much power . <p> They called the injunction a form of racial profiling that cast suspicion on young men simply for growing up in a hardscrabble area . The charge infuriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , he called it " demagoguery " and asked , " Since when did it become liberal or progressive for people not to be able to walk down their street without fear of violence ? " <p> Several teenagers said they had been stopped by police since the injunction was put in place and asked if they were on the list . McDonnell said officers were trained not to do so . <p> " The people who get stopped or contacted by police , there 's usually an independent reason why , " McDonnell said . <p> Police said they could not provide crime statistics for the " safety zone . " Herrera said the best measure of the injunction was what happened to the targeted men . <p> Men on the list have been arrested 23 times overall and 15 times in the injunction zone , according to Herrera 's office . Of those 15 arrests , all but one were for violating the injunction . Seven men accounted for the arrests . The 15th arrest was traffic-related . <p> The injunction has been positive " if you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He added that recent violence in the Mission might have been worse if the injunction were not in place . <p> Youth outreach worker Ren Quionez disagrees , saying the injunction fostered distrust between some residents and authorities . He said the nonassociation rule for men on the list was an impediment to groups trying to offer programs to the men . <p> " A safety zone sounds good in theory , but we need anti-poverty zones , " said Quionez , a former gang member who directs the nonprofit Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth . <p> On a recent afternoon , he walked down 24th Street admiring the murals honoring Latino heritage . When a young man with a tattoo that snaked high on his neck walked by , Quionez asked , " You want that taken off ? " <p> A few blocks down , a 17-year-old walked past with a red bandana pulled up to his eyes , as if he were about to rob a stagecoach . He said he was representing his neighborhood ; he would n't say whether he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quionez said . " Yes , it 's dysfunctional , distorted and destructive , but it 's something - something society is not providing . " <p> Quionez said the Norteo injunction had pushed crime to other neighborhoods - an assertion that Herrera and other law enforcement officials , including District Attorney Kamala Harris , said is not supported by police reports . <p> An attorney representing Antonio Napoleon , 25 , who has been arrested four times on suspicion of violating the injunction , said police were enforcing the program too broadly . <p> " One time he had red threads on the pocket of his shorts and red shoelaces , " attorney Matthew Witteman said . " He allegedly had , on his cell phone , a screen saver that they said was a gang sign . I know they have a problem down there , but come on . " <p> The injunction has also split residents in a neighborhood of contrasts , where homeless people sleep outside million-dollar restored Victorians .

She said the injunction was part of the push . <p> She pointed toward new , upscale businesses - a lingerie boutique and , near traditional Mexican bakeries , a gourmet doughnut shop offering such flavors as chipotle-cinnamon . The shops , deAnda said , did n't cater to locals . <p> But outside his parents nearby barber shop , Ben Castaneda , a 20-year-old college student , said he supported the rigid program - " if that 's what it 's going to take to stop innocent people from dying .
