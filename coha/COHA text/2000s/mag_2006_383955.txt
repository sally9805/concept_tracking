WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY NUTRITION Lisa Young , R.D. , nutrition consultant in NYC , adjunct assistant professor at New York University , author of The Portion Teller : Smartsize Your Way to Permanent Weight Loss ; portion teller.com : " Vegetarian-based diets run the risk of being short on iron , but Trenesa gets enough from fish and dark greens , which keep her energy up . She also chooses good fats ( nuts and olive oil ) and consumes them in small portions , though she should replace no- and lowcalorie processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with realfood alternatives , which will better satisfy her cravings . Trenesa 's protein-filled breakfast gives her sustained energy , though she should have just one piece of vegetarian bacon because it 's processed . The half-and-half in her coffee is high in calories and has almost no calcium ; she should swap it for skim or 1 percent milk . The tuna in her lunchtime salad is a good source of protein , but because it contains mercury , she should have it just twice a week and substitute with salmon or tofu . Her low-cal , fiber-rich dinner is great . Since Trenesa eats so healthfully during the day , she can reward herself at night with a little ranch dressing on her salad and a cookie . " FITNESS Cameron Shayne , LA. - based private trainer who works with Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox , Equinox fitness consultant , founder of Budokon exercise method , budokon . com : " Trenesa eats well and is constantly on the move , so she does n't have excess calories or fat that she needs to burn off , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days a week to keep her cardiovascular system strong . A young mother like Trenesa who 's short on spare time can try exercises that involve her daughter , such as a mother-child yoga class or DVD . On the weekends she should play a sport with her daughter , such as kicking around a ball in the park . Whatever the activities are , the most important thing is to do them regularly . " The cupcake Lover Cynthia Rowley , fashion designer , mid-40s " I 've been the same weight since high school , so I 'm lucky . I 'm usually too busy to think about eating right and at the same time every day . " DAILY DIET AND EXERCISE Consumes approximately 3000 calories 8:30 A.M.

WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY NUTRITION Says Young : " Cynthia can enjoy her favorite foods with some tweaks that will significantly cut back on fat and calories . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is empty calories , for a wholewheat English muffin or toast , which has fiber to fill her up and help quell her latemorning appetite for sugar . A little fruit midmorning will help suppress Cynthia 's sweet tooth ; everyone needs two to three cups of fruit a day for antioxidants , fiber , and healthy sugar ( which keeps you from craving white bread ) . If she has wholegrain bread at breakfast , she can splurge on one piece of French bread at lunch . Beets are a great source of antioxidants , but Cynthia should replace the fries with some protein ( either fish , chicken , or beans ) to fill her up and give her longlasting energy . If she likes to snack on popcorn , she should use natural kernels popped in an air popper without salt or oil . A pasta dinner can be made healthier by switching to whole-wheat pasta with marinara sauce and Parmesan cheese . But if you have pasta , skip the bread . A small , rich dessert is all right if you do n't indulge every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . " FITNESS Says Shayne : " There 's a difference between being fit and being healthy . Cynthia looks fit , but she may not be as I healthy as she could be . A high-fat diet releases a lot of toxins into the body , and with no regular cardiovascular stimulation , her body ca n't flush them out sufficiently , which means that when she reaches her 50s and 60s , she could lose a lot of the energy she has now . Everyone needs at least one hour of exercise three days a week , and women on the go like Cynthia can get their cardio and resistance training all at once by doing exercises that work with their own body weight , such as yoga , Piltes , kickboxing , or Budokon ( a mix of martial arts , yoga , and meditation ) . If Cynthia 's schedule is too erratic for her to attend classes , all these exercises are available on DVD try Budokon Beginning Practice , $14.99 ; budokon.com .

One or two cups of decaf tea . WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY NUTRITION Says Young : " Christie 's diet is well-rounded and rich in antioxidants , fiber , protein , and water , but she 's not consuming much dairy , so her soy milk should be calcium-fortified . Christie 's lunchtime salad is a high-fiber , lowcalorie choice , but she should add in chickpeas , beans , or low-cal feta cheese for some protein to satiate her . She could also have a piece of whole-grain or whole-wheat bread . People think bread is the enemy , but the starch in a piece of bread will help ward off cravings . " FITNESS Says Shayne : " Christie 's routine is good for her age and lifestyle . But in your 50s , you need to do resistance work using your body weight to strengthen bones and prevent osteoporosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three times a week . She 'll find she wo n't need as much cardio because yoga will make her body even stronger . " As told to Victoria Kirby Sidebar Delicious red shades on lips and nails are a fiery combination .
