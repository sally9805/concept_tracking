Influenced by Japanese comic books and animation ( and with an eye to Edo-period screens ) , Takashi Murakami creates inflatable sculptures and intensely colored paintings . A recent show of his canvases at a New York gallery coincided with a temporary installation of large-scale sculptures at Grand Central Terminal . Photograph // A good number of the 500,000 people who are said to use New York City 's Grand Central Terminal each weekday pass through Vanderbilt Hall , a former waiting room of Beaux-Arts splendor located between the terminal 's chief 42nd Street entrance and its main concourse . Generally , rushhour commuters stride across the 12,000-square-foot hall with nary a glance at their elegant surroundings , which include five massive gilt chandeliers and an ornately decorated ceiling . This was often not the case , however , during Takashi Murakami 's recent monthlong installation of five sculptures in the space . Even the most oblivious travelers risked being jolted out of their routines by the three giant helium-filled objects floating above them . Visiting Vanderbilt Hall on the installation 's first day , I noticed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptures that she ploughed into a slower-moving man in front of her . Other people , similarly distracted , nearly collided with a kiosk standing in the middie of the hall . The works that caught their attention were two 16foot-diameter vinyl spheres ( one white , one pale orange ) adorned with cartoony images of eyes and spirals , and another 26-foot-high inflatable that depicted a big-headed figure dangling upside down from a large floral-patterned beach ball . All three balloons , held in place by thin wires , hovered some 30 feet in the air , high enough to escape instantaneous notice but low and big enough that they were impossible to miss . Their cartoon associations-the 38-year-old Murakami has been heavily influenced by Japanese cartoons ( anime ) and comic books ( manga ) - lent the installation a tone of zestful irreverence . But there was a bizarre , almost mysterious quality to these floating sculptures , especially the two globes , that elicited , it seemed to me , curiosity and puzzlement from many passersby Photograph Takashi Murakami : Kinoko , 2001 , acrylic on canvas mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photos this article , unless otherwise noted , courtesy Marianne Boesky Gallery , New York .

Resting on circular mirrors , these fiberglass disks featured surfaces covered with more spiral and eye motifs-the entire installation was titled " Wink . " Many of these eyes were slightly raised , making them look like thick decals . As usual with Murakami 's work , which is nearly always fabricated by Japanese artisans , the craftsmanship of the disks was highly detailed and faultless . ( It does n't say much for U.S. fabricators that the only American-made work at Grand Central , the dangling figure and daisy-covered globe balloon , looked like it was made of cheap beach-ball plastic and , even worse , developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tougher Japanese globes held up fine . ) The disks , which measured 12 feet in diameter , looked like mini-UFOs of a friendly persuasion . I 'm sure any children who saw them wanted to clamber on top and wait to be levitated up to the globular mother ships , but , alas , tape marks on the floor and " do not touch " signs probably dissuaded them . " Wink " was an engaging installation and the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the arts organization Creative Time should be congratulated for commissioning an unconventional artist like Murakami , but the sculptures would have been even better with a little interactivity , which is never a bad thing for public art . Although it may be the best-known aspect of his work , sculpture is hardly Murakami 's sole focus . He is just as seriously involved in painting-as demonstrated by a fascinating show of his new canvases that opened at Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York the same week as " Wink " - and has created a line of art-related merchandise that includes T-shirts , plastic figurines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murakami 's Web site ( www.hiropon-factory.com ) offers such items for sale , as well as providing information about the work of other Japanese artists engaged in interpreting , and entering , popular culture . Some might be put off by this blatant merchandising , but in fact it seems consistent with Murakami 's enthusiastic embrace of Japanese popular culture and , as the artist himself points out , it relates to a very old Japanese blending of what the West segregates as " art " and " craft . " Although university-trained in traditional painting , Murakami clearly finds youth-oriented subcultures to be the more visually vibrant part of Japanese society . This position is articulated in " Superflat , " an exhibition Murakami curated that is touring the United States . As well as elucidating the contemporary background of his own work , Murakami 's show and catalogue argue for a certain continuity in Japanese visual culture . The catalogue opens , for instance , by drawing parallels between Hokusai 's 36 Views of Mount Fuji and a cartoon called " Galaxy Express 999 " by TV animator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " superflat " refers to the two-dimensional style of Japanese television animation , which has been a major influence on Murakami and the other artists in the exhibition . ( Electronics buffs may already know the term as applied by Panasonic to its new flatscreen televisions . ) But , as critical theorist Hiroki Azuma points out in the " Superflat " catalogue , the term can also refer to the " leveling of high culture and subculture , the dissolving of borders between genres . " Azuma also hints at a connection to Rauschenberg 's " flatbed " images , before launching into a Lacan- and Derrida-influenced interpretation of Murakami 's eyeball imagery .

San Francisco , Ifr ofllodern Art . // And those eyes certainly beg to be interpreted . Perhaps not since Dali painted an eye-filled curtain for Hitchcock 's Spellbound ( 1945 ) has an artist been so ocular obsessed . For Azuma , the " multitude of eyes " in a typical Murakami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to its equation of gaze with castration 's dysfunction . " On the subject of the psychosexual , it 's worth noting the absence in these two recent New York presentations of any of Murakami 's more explicitly erotic works , which include cartoonlike sculptures of naked ejaculating male figures and females whose enormous breasts spew lariatlike streams of milk . Last fall , however , P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City presented a three-part Murakami sculpture depicting an adolescent girl as eroticized superhero . The show was nicely timed to coincide with a retrospective devoted to John Wesley , that American proponent of eccentrically stylized Pop eroticism . Currently , Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts is hosting " Takashi Murakami : Made in Japan , " the most extensive exhibition to date of the artist 's work in this country . Included in the show are several scrolls by Soga Shohaka , the l8thcentury Japanese artist Murakami has cited as an influence . The museum has also invited Murakami to hang some of his paintings in its galleries of traditional Japanese art . The centerpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas dated 1999 that presents some 150 variously Covered with eye images and other biomorphic motifs ( that fresized , wildly recall eccentric mushrooms such agains Myron Stout an elegant silver ground .

The ensemble , which is cently recall eccentric abstractionists such as Myron Stout and Nicholas Krushenick ) , these unreal botanical specimens exhibit a delightful variety The ensemble , which is centered on one gargantuan mushroom rising over the others like Seattle 's Space Needle , suggests nothing so much as a casting call for a cartoon epic about a fungal universe . Surrounding it in the gallery were smaller paintings with less epic fungus groupings and some canvases depicting daisyclad vines ( each daisy sports a wide-mouthed " smiley face " ) strung sparingly and gracefully across silvery voids . In a smaller side gallery hung two grimmer paintings of warped , schematically drawn human skulls , perched atop spinal columns , with jewel-like daisy designs in their eye sockets . Photograph // As well as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disks at Vanderbilt Hall-rather than being smallscale UFOs , they are giant mushroom caps . Confronted with this panoply of weirdly colored fungi , most viewers will probably think first of psychedelic mushrooms , and , indeed , the painting does have a hallucinatory intensity that derives as much from its exquisite , lava-lamp details as from the overall impression it gives of unceasing , weird proliferation . But another interpretation also presents itself . For a Japanese artist to choose to paint a field of mutant , sometimes rather malign , mushrooms ca n't help but summon up the " mushroom " clouds that rose above Hiroshima and Nagasaki half a century ago , and their aftermath of disease and deformity . Although Murakami 's paintings are designed on a computersomething most evident in the warped-skull paintings-and filled with pop-culture references , they also proclaim their connections to Japanese art of the past . The silver grounds recall the metallic backgrounds of painted screens of the Edo period and the concatenations of flowers and leaves are instantly recognizable as belonging to the Japanese tradition of painting blossoming trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugging into older forms-Warhol , for instance , successfully combined newswire photos with Catholicism 's iconic traditions-but Murakami 's art is impressive for the remarkably seamless way that it brings together new and old : those silver backgrounds owe as much to computer screens as they do to Edo screens ( and perhaps also something to Warhol 's silkscreen paintings , just as the inflatables recall Warhol 's helium-filled silver pillows ) . Beyond its synthesis of Japan 's past and present , Murakami 's new work is especially valuable for its rampant formal play-or perhaps it is precisely Murakami 's sense of mission in regard to Japanese visual culture that helps drive his artistic imagination . In any case , I could n't find any exact repetitions among the hordes of multicolored fungi in Mushroom Painting . But what a great pleasure it was to hunt for them , and how hard it was to think of many other contemporary painters who could dare such seemingly limitless formal invention .

We had just picked up our bags when Frank 's eyes suddenly opened wide . As he started to fall over the luggage rack , I cried out for help . Almost immediately , two men lowered him to the floor and two women began CPR . Then the men got a defibrillator . The first shock did n't help Frank , . but the second one did . <p> Months later , a doctor called to find out if Frank was still alive . He is , and he does not have brain damage . The doctor said the first shock was given 2 1/2 minutes after Frank 's heart stopped and that the paramedics arrived in 5 1/2 minutes . There are no words to express our appreciation to the people who helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help . I hope everyone who was so kind to us will read this letter , especially the two young ladies ! <p> Virginia Sumersille We hope they do , too ! Your letter is a good reminder that sudden cardiac arrest can happen anywhere and anytime . We 've been advocating for years that automated external defibrillators ( AEDs ) should be as common as fire extinguishers . Fortunately , the lifesaving devices are now in visible locations at airports , stadiums , and some schools and churches . But most heart emergencies happen in the home . As the adage goes : Plan for the worst and hope for the best . When determining your response to a heart emergency at home , consider : Are you or a family member trained in CPR ? Where is the nearest AED ? How long will it take for the AED to arrive ? Is it feasible to have a home defibrillator or one in a neighborhood clubhouse or lockbox ? Today 's AEDs are so simple that almost anyone can use them without prior training . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AED , remember three things : 1 ) recognize a heart emergency ; 2 ) open the AED box ; and 3 ) follow the prompts . <p> L : A Rare Type of Breast Cancer Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> Why do n't more mammogram technicians know about inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) ? I am aware of three cases in my area . However , I recently had a mammogram at a large hospital , and the technician had never heard of it . IBC does not show on a mammogram . <p> Dorothy Negley " Medical Mailbox " readers can help raise awareness about inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) by informing others , including mammography technicians , about this relatively rare but aggressive cancer . In women with this condition , cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast , which often appears red and swollen . Diagnosis is based primarily on the results of a doctor 's examination . <p> The bottom line : Get evaluated by a medical provider if you note any changes in your breast . Treatments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . <p> L : Skin Problem Could Be Eczema Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> My husband ( age 62 ) has red spots on both feet . They are not bothersome unless they form blisters under the toes that later peel . The mystery is that he also had this problem last winter . When warm weather came they totally disappeared . He just had a complete blood work up and everything is normal . Any thoughts ? <p> Jeannine Coates POST CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AND DERMATOLOGY EXPERT DR . C. WILLIAM HANKE REPLIES : <p> " Your husband 's symptoms are most commonly associated with a type of eczema called dyshidrotic eczema that results from lack of moisture in the skin caused by seasonal changes to cold , dry temperature , frequent skin washing , and indoor heating which decreases skin moisture . <p> " Treatment includes minimal use of soap , applying over-the-counter emollients ( ointments are better than creams and lotions which are water-based ) and , when severe , the use of prescription strength topical steroids . Early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Dyshidrotic eczema is also called pompholyx , a term that derives from cheiropompholyx meaning ' hand and bubble ' in Greek . Patients typically present with itchy bumps that progress to water blisters on the sides of the hands and feet in a near symmetric distribution . " <p> L : Help for Overactive Bladder Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I am an 82-year-old male and have the urge to urinate every 30 to 60 minutes . I 've had this for about three months and no medicines seem to help . I had prostate surgery about 25 years ago . Do other urologists have patients as old as me with similar symptoms ? <p> R. D. Stewart DR . JERRY BLAIVAS REPLIES : <p> " The symptoms you describe match those of refractory overactive bladder ( OAB ) , a very common condition with many causes . In general , there are two options for treating OAB . The first is to try different treatments , like the medications you have taken . The second method is to do additional diagnostic testing to determine if an underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , common causes of OAB include : 1 ) a blockage by the prostate or by scar tissue from your previous prostate surgery ; 2 ) neurologic conditions such as stroke ; 3 ) bladder cancer ; and 4 ) bladder stones . In my opinion , it would be prudent to undergo testing for these conditions before considering electrostimulation . If none are present , then that therapy may be indicated . <p> " The theory of electrical stimulation is that stimulating certain nerves blocks other impulses that are giving false signals and making you feel as though you need to urinate when you really do n't . The basic type of electrostimulation is a weekly outpatient treatment consisting of stimulating an electrode placed at the ankle or anus for a short period of time . <p> " The second type , known as neuromodulation , is often more effective . It consists of two minor operations that are usually performed one week apart and under local anesthesia . Both procedures are very safe . In the first stage , the electrode is implanted alongside nerves in your lower back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If effective , the second stage is to permanently implant the battery beneath your skin . This treatment can be very effective in men your age .

The least thing she bumps with her hand or arm immediately causes a distinct bruise that lasts for days . Why does this happen or what can be done to stop it ? If age is a factor , please explain why . <p> Barney Darche DR . HANKE AGAIN RESPONDS : <p> " Older adults often bruise easily because of gradual changes that take place in the layer of fat just below the skin surface . As a person ages , this layer diminishes and the skin becomes thinner and less flexible . The loss of fat also decreases the skin 's cushioning effect . <p> " These changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels to break more easily . Applying topical emollients such as Vaseline or other over-the-counter ointments and minimizing soap application and hot showers may help combat skin dryness and prevent easy bruising . <p> " Older adults are most susceptible to bruises on the forearms , hands , legs , and feet . Sometimes the bruising will spread down the body in the direction of gravity . A bruise on a leg will usually take longer to heal than one on the face or arms . Most bruises are not a cause for concern and will go away on their own . " <p> L : Omega-3 Tackles Her Triglycerides Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> In response to Margaret Coy in your March/April 2009 issue , I would have to say that taking omega-3 definitely has a role in good health . My cholesterol has always been high , with triglycerides soaring above desired levels . Lipitor brought the LDL and HDL to appropriate levels but did not affect the triglycerides , so my doctor recommended taking 1200 mgs of omega-3 fish oil every day .

But I read that Bobby Darin died at 37 after having his teeth cleaned . Should I insist on taking an antibiotic before teeth cleaning ? <p> Dee Webb POST CARDIOLOGY CONSULTANT DR . <p> DOUGLAS ZIPES REPLIES : <p> " Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is now recommended only for high-risk patients , such as those with prosthetic ( artificial ) heart valves or some congenital heart defects . In general , simple mitral valve prolapse would not warrant such treatment . Despite widespread use for 50 years , there is no scientific evidence that antibiotics prevent infective endocarditis ( heart infections , usually on a heart valve ) from dental work . Bobby Darin apparently contracted endocarditis after a dental procedure and reportedly did not take his antibiotics .

If you are having trouble measuring insulin in a syringe , talk to your doctor about using an insulin pen or cartridge . Many types of insulin are available in these forms .
