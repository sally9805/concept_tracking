KENOSHA // October 21 , 2004 // My face was tilted toward the stream of water from the shower-head . Water spilled from the corners of my closed eyes as my fingers outlined the unfamiliar lump in my right breast . Around and around again , I traced its edges . Try as I might , it would n't go away . How could I have missed something this size when I showered yesterday ? Or the day before ? Or ... but it did n't matter . I 'd found it today , this lump , firm and big on the side of my breast . I kept my eyes closed and finished rinsing my hair . // Until that moment-until the lump-October 21 , 2004 , was meant to be an ordinary day , if such a thing can exist on a campaign trail two weeks before a presidential election . An 11:00 A.M. town hall meeting at the Kenosha United Auto Workers hall . A rally later that day in Erie , Pennsylvania . Scranton in time for dinner , and Maine by sunrise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand people , prepare to tape a segment for Good Morning America , discuss Medicare premiums with senior citizens , talk college tuition with parents , and , if it was a very good day , influence at least a few undecided voters . Just another ordinary day . // But I had learned long ago that it was typically the most ordinary days that the careful pieces of life can break away and shatter . As I climbed out of the shower , I heard the door to my hotel room click shut . I knew instantly who it was , and I was relieved . " Hargrave , " I called out from the bathroom , wrapping myself in a towel , " come feel this . " Hargrave McElroy was my dear friend of twenty-three years , my daughter Cate 's godmother , a teacher at the high school my children had attended , and now my assistant and companion on the road . She had agreed to travel with me after John had been named the Democratic vice presidential nominee . I had previously chased away a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent them instead of letting them take care of me , which was wearing me out . I needed a grown-up , and I asked Hargrave to join me . She had no experience on campaigns , but she was a teacher and what 's more , the mother of three boys . That 's enough experience to handle any job . Choosing Hargrave was one of the best decisions I would make . She instinctively knew when to buy more cough drops , when to hand me a fresh Diet Coke , and , I now hoped , what to do after one discovers a lump in her breast . // Hargrave pressed her fingers against the bulge on my right breast , which felt as smooth and firm as a plum . She pressed her lips together and looked at me directly and gently , just like she was listening to a student in one of her classes give the wrong answer . " Hmmm , " she said , calmly meeting my eyes . " When was your last mammogram ? " // I hated to admit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . For years , I had made all the excuses women make for not taking care of these things-the two young children I was raising , the house I was running . We had moved to Washington four years earlier , and I had never found a doctor there . Life just always seemed to get in the way . All lousy excuses , I knew , for not taking care of myself . // " We better get that checked out as soon as we can , " Hargrave said . // I had a feeling she meant that very morning , but that was not going to be possible . We had less than two weeks before the election . Undoubtedly people had already gathered in the union hall to listen to the speakers scheduled before me , and there were young volunteers setting up for a town hall in Erie , and-as the King of Siam said in the musical- " et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . " My lump would have to wait ; the ordinary day would go on as scheduled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go shopping . // The previous evening , I had spotted an outlet mall on our way to the hotel . We had spent the night in a Radisson-a fact I discovered that morning when I read the soap in the bathroom . Since I started campaigning , it had been a different hotel in a different city each night . We would arrive late , traveling after it was too late to campaign , and we would enter and exit most hotels through the same back door used to take out the trash . Unless the trash dumpster bore the name of the hotel , I 'd figure out where we were only if I remembered to look at the soap in the bathroom . // As soon as we spotted the outlets , Hargrave , Karen Finney-my press secretary-and I started calculating . The stores would open at ten , and it was a ten-minute drive to the UAW hall . That left about forty-five minutes to shop . It was n't a lot of time , but for three women who had n't been shopping in months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything it might mean , I had no intention of changing our plan . We had all been looking forward to the unprecedented time devoted to something as mindless , frivolous , and selfish as shopping . The clothes I had in my suitcase that day were basically the same ones I had packed when I left Washington in early July , and it was now nearing November in Wisconsin . It was cold , I was sick of my clothes , and , to be honest , I was n't particularly concerned about the lump . This had happened before , about ten years earlier . I had found what turned out to be a harmless fibrous cyst . I had it removed , and there were no problems . Granted , this lump was clearly larger than the other , but as I felt its smooth contour , I was convinced this had to be another cyst . I was n't going to allow myself to think it could be anything else . // In the backseat of the Suburban , I told Hargrave how to reach Wells Edmundson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ear , she asked me for the details . No , the skin on my breast was n't puckered . Yes , I had found a small lump before . // At the Dana Buchman outlet , I looked through the blazers as Hargrave stood nearby , still on the phone to Wells . I spotted a terrific red jacket , and I waved to Hargrave for her opinion . " The lump was really pretty big , " she said into the phone while giving me a thumbs-up on the blazer . There we were , two women , surrounded by men with earpieces , whispering about lumps and flipping through the sales rack . The saleswomen huddled , their eyes darting from the Secret Service agents to the few customers in the store . Then they huddled again . Neither of us looked like someone who warranted special protection-certainly not me , flipping through the racks at manic speed , watching the clock tick toward 10:30 . Whatever worry I had felt earlier , Hargrave had taken on . She had made the phone calls ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would worry , and she would let me be the naive optimist . And I was grateful for that . // She hung up the phone . " Are you sure you want to keep going ? " she asked me , pointing out that our schedule during the remaining eleven days until the election entailed stops in thirty-five cities . " It could be exhausting . " Stopping was n't going to make the lump go away , and exhaustion was a word I had long ago banished from my vocabulary . // " I 'm fine , " I said . " And I 'm getting this red blazer . " // " You 're braver than I am , " she told me . " From now on , I will always think of that blazer as the Courage Jacket . " Within minutes , she was back on the phone with Kathleen McGlynn , our scheduler in D.C. , who could make even impossible schedules work , telling her only that we needed some free time the next Friday for a private appointment . // While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up an appointment with Dr. Edmundson for the next week , when we were scheduled to return to Raleigh . Through the phone calls and despite her worry , she still found a pale pink jacket that suited her gentle nature perfectly . All the plans to deal with the lump were made , and the appointments were days away . I wanted to push it all aside , and thanks to Hargrave and the thirty-five cities in my near future , I could . We gathered Karen and headed out for that ordinary day . // The town hall meeting went well-except at one point I reversed the names of George Bush and John Kerry in a line I had delivered a hundred times , a mistake I had never made before and never made after . " While John Kerry protects the bank accounts of pharmaceutical companies by banning the safe reimportation of prescription drugs , George Bush wants to protect your bank account .... " I got no further , as the crowd groaned , and one old man in the front good-naturedly shouted out that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it again , right this time , and we had a good laugh . I looked at Hargrave and rolled my eyes . Was this how it would be for the next week ? Fortunately , it was not . We flew to an icy Pennsylvania , where the two town halls went well enough , or at least without event . I had my legs again . And then on to Maine for the following day . // I could tell by the look on the technician 's face that it was bad news . Hargrave and I-and the Secret Service agents-had ridden to Dr. Edmundson 's office as soon as we landed back in Raleigh the following week , just four days before the election . I had told Karen and Ryan Montoya , my trip director on the road , about the lump , and the Secret Service agents knew what was going on because they were always there , though they never mentioned a word about it to me or to anyone else . Ryan had quietly disappeared to my house in Raleigh , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me inside . I was lucky because Wells Edmundson was not only my doctor , he was our friend . His daughter Erin had played soccer with our daughter Cate on one of the teams that John coached over the years . His nurse , Cindy , met me at the back door and led me to Wells ' office , dotted with pictures of his children . // " I do n't have the equipment here to tell you anything for certain , " Wells said after examining the lump . Ever the optimist , he agreed that the smooth contour I felt could be a cyst , and ever the cautious doctor , he ordered an immediate mammogram . His attitude seemed so very positive , I was more buoyed than worried . As Hargrave and I rode to a nearby radiology lab for the test , I felt fine . One thing I had learned over the years : hope is precious , and there 's no reason to give it up until you absolutely have to . // This is where the story changes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , looked terrible . The bump may have felt smooth to my touch , but on the other side-on the inside-it had grown tentacles , now glowing a slippery green on the computer screen . The technician called in the radiologist . Time moved like molasses as I lay in the cold examining room . I grew more worried , and then came the words that by this point seemed inevitable : " This is very serious . " The radiologist 's face was a portrait of gloom . // I dressed and walked back out as I had walked in , through a darkened staff lounge toward a back door where the Secret Service car and Hargrave waited for me . I was alone in the dark , and I felt frightened and vulnerable . This was the darkest moment , the moment it really hit me . I had cancer . As the weight of it sank in , I slowed my step and the tears pushed against my eyes . I pushed back . Not now . Now I had to walk back into that sunlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hargrave , who would be watching my face for clues just as I had watched the image on the ultrasound monitor . // " It 's bad , " was all I could manage to Hargrave. // As the Secret Service backed out onto the road for home , Hargrave rubbed my shoulder and silent tears snuck across my cheeks . I had to call John , and I could n't do that until I could speak without crying . The thing I wanted to do most was talk to him , and the thing I wanted to do least was tell him this news . // I had mentioned nothing to John earlier , although I spoke to him several times a day during the campaign , as we had for our entire marriage . I could n't let him worry when he was so far away . And I had hoped there would be nothing to tell him . Certainly not this . I had promised myself he would never have to hear bad news again . He-and Cate , our older daughter-had suffered too much already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years earlier , and we had all been through the worst life could deal us . I never wanted to see either of them experience one more moment of sadness . And , after almost thirty years of marriage , I knew exactly how John would respond . As soon as he heard , he would insist that we drop everything and take care of the problem . // Sitting in the car , I dialed John 's number . Lexi Bar , who had been with us for years and was like family , answered . I skipped our usual banter and asked to speak to John . He had just landed in Raleigh-we had both come home to vote and to attend a large rally where the rock star Jon Bon Jovi was scheduled to perform . // He got on the phone , and I started slowly . " Sweetie , " I began . It 's how I always began . And then came the difference : I could n't speak . Tears were there , panic was there , need was there , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't speak that something was wrong . // " Just tell me what 's wrong , " he insisted . // I explained that I had found the lump , had it checked out by Wells , and now needed to have a needle biopsy . " I 'm sure it 's nothing , " I assured him and told him that I wanted to wait until after the election to have the biopsy . He said he 'd come right home , and I went there to wait for him . //
