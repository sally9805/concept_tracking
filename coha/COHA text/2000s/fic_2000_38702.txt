WHEN I WAS A BOY , I LIVED with my mother in a trailer on the banks of the Black Warrior River . My father was dead , killed one night when , drunk , he drove his truck into an eighteen-wheeler out on the Birmingham highway . My mother cut up chickens for a living , standing before a never-ending stream of carcasses moving toward her on an overhead belt . She was constantly having trouble with infections from the minor cuts that resulted from her work . One of my clearest memories of that time is of her leaning against the kitchen sink and looking at her hands and crying . She never complained about the work , but she was vain about her hands . <p> At the beginning of my freshman year in high school , Raymond Smart came to live with us . My mother had had men friends before . Some came to pick her up at the trailer , but more often she met them in Birmingham to go dancing at one of the clubs there . Sometimes she stayed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins , but she always came home on Sunday morning to take me to church . <p> I can recall the day when I realized those men were her lovers , that she had spent the night in some man 's arms . I do n't think I was jealous or even shocked , just curious as I watched her dress before going to meet one of them , making herself pretty in front of her bedroom mirror . By then I had begun to try to imagine , as I lay in my bed and held myself in my hand , what it would be like to make love to a girl . <p> Raymond moved in maybe a year after I began to think seriously about girls . He told me that at the trailer plant where he worked , they called the trailers they made " coaches . " They liked to pretend they were making those silver Airstreams , real trailers you could pull behind a car and drive right out of Alabama to a place like Montana . Sometimes he talked about buying one and driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was his dream . He 'd sit in front of the TV and watch fishing shows with the same enthusiasm that my crippled grandmother watched television evangelists . He had a bass boat he was making payments on . He liked to fish at night , and he did that three or four nights a week , coming home at daybreak to eat breakfast with my mother . He said he was after a million-dollar bass , a world record that would bring the fisherman who caught it endorsements from tackle manufacturers . I do n't know if that was true , but Raymond believed it . <p> I think Raymond wanted to marry my mother , but she was n't interested in marrying again . I can imagine him pressing her on the subject in that insistent , quiet way of his . I never heard him raise his voice to her , and he certainly never did to me . He was a gentle man , who often massaged my mother 's feet after she came home from work . She 'd sigh in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was quiet like him . <p> Raymond often would look at me and say things like , " Still waters run deep . " I can picture him saying that , sitting on the couch , massaging my mother 's feet , himself barefoot and shirtless because of the summer heat , his lean but muscular chest , like the chest of a fighter , just as smooth and hairless as mine . He claimed his Cherokee blood was the reason . And maybe he was telling the truth , because his face did have an Indian look to it . <p> Then Raymond got fired from the trailer plant . He said it was because of a faulty alternator in his truck that made him late for work . He was unable to find another job . The boat dealer repossessed the bass boat . Raymond was friendly with the man who came to get it . They stood around and smoked cigarettes and drank a beer together . Then Raymond helped him put the boat on the hitch . I watched from my window . I was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English class . <p> Raymond watched him drive off with the boat . Then , walking with his head down , he came back to the trailer . I heard him fooling around in the living room for a time . Finally he wandered back to my bedroom . He usually was careful not to disturb me when I was doing my schoolwork . He stuck his head around the corner of the doorway . <p> " You reading ? " he asked . <p> " That 's right , " I said . <p> He came in and stood by my bed . " You could read that to me , but that 'd take a long time . I ai n't got that much time . You 're a smart one ; all right . Still waters run deep . " <p> My teachers thought I was smart , sure to be class valedictorian , and that would win me a scholarship to the university at Tuscaloosa . Raymond was excited about that because he was a devoted football fan . I might be a source for fifty-yard-line tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no time to read . To me it appeared that he had nothing but time . He 'd lie around the trailer all day smoking cigarettes my mother had bought him and watching television . There was not even any work to do in the garden ; it was early September , and only a few tomato vines were left . Raymond and I had not been good about tending the soil . A nice stand of Johnson grass had sprung up where the squash was supposed to be . It seemed that he had given up looking for a job , though just before the evening meal , which my mother cooked after work , he 'd make a great show of going through the classified ads in the paper . Then he might complain that the steel industry was mostly gone from Birmingham , that once a man could make good wages there . <p> One Friday night , just after Raymond had said the blessing over the pork chops , he started in on those vanished steel-mill jobs . I could tell it was something my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch Raymond 's eye , but it was too late . He was caught up in his lament over those cold furnaces , enamored with the sound of his own voice . He was not looking at either of us as he finished his speech , delivering the last words in the direction of the screen door , through which we could see the empty space where the bass boat had once been parked . <p> He looked up to my mother for sympathy like he always did , but instead was met with the sight of her holding out her hands toward him . It had not been a good day ; there were bandages on three fingers of her left hand . <p> " My hands are ruined , " she said . <p> " Why , they ai n't , " he said . " The hands of a nymph is what they are . " <p> He smiled at her , pleased with himself . We 'd been studying Greek mythology in school , and Raymond had got stuck on those nymphs . I think he imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did hesitate a moment , temporarily rendered speechless , hearing that word come out of his mouth . But it was too late for sweet talk . <p> " I 'm ruining my hands so you can sit here and watch TV and smoke cigarettes , " she said . <p> " I 've been looking , " he said . <p> " Ha , you have n't half tried . " <p> " It 's tight in the trailer business . " <p> " Do something else . Work at McDonald 's . " <p> " Nobody knows coaches like I do . " <p> " What are you saying ? That you 've got a skill ? " <p> " Nobody ever complained about my work . " <p> " You never made coaches . You made trailers . Just like this one . That start to fall apart soon as folks move in . " She looked up at where the ceiling sagged . " I wonder how many studs somebody like you left out of this one . The first time a tornado comes by here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they often cheated on the construction and slipped inferior work past the inspectors . " Building trailers is no different from cutting up chickens , " she said . " It do n't take a college degree to do it . " <p> Now my mother had begun to cry . Raymond got up and tried to comfort her , but she pushed him away and retreated to the bedroom . We sat at the table and tried to eat , but neither of us had an appetite . We cleared the table and washed the dishes . Then we watched TV until it cooled off enough to sleep . When I went to bed , Raymond had all the lights off . Bathed in the bluish glow from the screen , he was watching a fishing show . <p> I woke early and found Raymond asleep on the couch . My mother 's car was gone . She had left a note on the refrigerator . She had gone with her sister to a flea market in the town of Warrior . <p> I spent the morning reading while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay inside , we went out and sat in a couple of easy chairs under a big sweet gum . Raymond had bought the chairs at a yard sale , along with a plastic tarp that he threw over them when it rained . But the chairs had been left uncovered a few times during storms and now always smelled musty . <p> " Nothing like a sweet gum for shade , " Raymond said . " Yes , " I said , " nothing like it . " <p> Raymond always said that about the tree . He was a man who reduced all of life to a few favorite phrases . <p> " Your mama is a good woman , " he said . <p> " Yes , she is , " I said . <p> I took up my book and began to read . I hoped he would not start in on " Still waters run deep , " but he was silent of starshaped leaves as if waiting for some sort of mystery to be revealed . Then the phone rang . <p> Raymond got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , and ran for the trailer . I guessed it was my mother . I imagined him standing in the kitchen , which by this time of day was like one of those steel-plant furnaces , and saying sweet things to her . He was inside so long that I had returned to my book . Then suddenly he was standing over me . <p> " We 'll be fixing our own supper , " he said . <p> We made hamburgers on the grill and ate them under the sweet gum . Raymond drank a few beers . He offered me one , and I accepted . It was n't my first . I thought I would miss my mother , but I did n't . I liked being alone with Raymond , who was treating me like a man . We sat under the tree-where it was already dark , though in the open you could still read a newspaper-and drank the last of the beer . It had taken me a long time to finish just one , but Raymond had gone through a six-pack . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back tonight , " Raymond said . <p> " We 'll see her in church tomorrow , " I said . <p> " We ai n't going to church . " <p> " Mr. Wade is getting baptized . Do n't you want to see that ? " <p> Marion Wade had spent his youth making money in strip-mining . He drank and chased women and treated his childless wife badly . People liked to say that strip-mining was the right business for him , that he was digging his way right down to hell and that one day the devil would rise out of one of those coal pits and snatch him away . Now he was saved , and as was the custom at our church , he was going to be baptized in the river right after the morning service . <p> Raymond explained that we would fish the section of the river above the low-water bridge where baptisms were held . We could watch the ceremony from a platform built high in the branches of a big poplar that grew on the riverbank , just above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad for a tree swing from which you could drop into the water . I had spent many summer afternoons there . No one would be using the swing now , though , because if you tried , you 'd be likely to hit a rock and break your legs . The water was that low . <p> " We do n't have a boat , " I said . " And if we did the river 's too low to float one . " <p> " Billy Clay said I could borrow his canoe , " Raymond said . " We 'll walk it down the shoals , ride it in the deep places . " <p> " It 'll be too hot to fish . They 'll be lying down at the bottom . Maybe we could do it at night . That 's when they 're feeding . " I knew the fish would be easy to find . They 'd be hemmed up in a few of the big pools . <p> " I got a way to get ' em , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who used them said they were placing a long-distance call to the fish , which , stunned by the charge , flopped about on the surface . And some total outlaws used malathion or whatever poison was handy . <p> " We 're gon na gig ' em , " he said . <p> What Raymond had in mind was a five-tined frog gig attached to a basswood pole . We spent the rest of the evening making the gigs . We cut long , inch-wide strips of rubber from an old inner tube and attached them to the butts of the poles . At the ends of the strips we tied loops , which went over our wrists . We practiced on a cardboard box , and the system worked beautifully . The rubber cushioned the shock against the wrist when the gig reached the end of its tether . And you could quickly retrieve it and make another throw . <p> I went to sleep dreaming of spearing fish in the river . I do n't think Raymond slept at all ; I woke up a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . When he got me up , it was still dark . I could smell the breakfast he had made . We ate quickly and then drove the truck to Billy Clay 's barn , where the canoe was stored . It was aluminum but made to look like an Indian birchbark , the kind I sometimes saw on TV in old movies . The ends were raised , and on the bow was painted the silhouette of an Indian chief in a war bonnet . We put it in the bed of the truck and headed for the river . <p> We crossed the bridge just as the sun was coming up . The water was covered with patches of mist . The rocky shoals were exposed , piles of open mussel shells , their white insides brilliant in the sunlight , scattered here and there . The mussels had been fished out of the shallows by raccoons . <p> We drove down a rutted dirt track to the river and unloaded . We had brought two ice chests , one for the fish and one for beer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bow , we walked the canoe out into the river . The rocks were slippery . We both stumbled as we wrestled with the heavy boat , the metal grating against the rocks . It was slow going , but we finally reached the first pool . That 's what the river was , a series of deep pools separated by shoals . It probably dropped four or five feet per mile between where we were and the low-water bridge . <p> " Just big fish , boy , " Raymond said . " Nothing but bass and catfish . Others 'll be too small or full of bones . " <p> Bass , gar , bream , carp , and catfish all lived in the river . <p> The pool was perfectly clear . We were wearing pairs of Raymond 's polarized fishing glasses , which allowed us to see right through the glare of the sun off the water . The moment I put my foot in , the water warm as a bath , I saw a fish dart away . Raymond told me to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of the pool , " he said . <p> Fifty yards away there was , I knew , a three-foot drop . But no water was flowing over it now . Raymond had tied the painter around his waist and pulled the canoe along after him . We moved slowly ; spears held high , watching the water like a couple of wading birds . <p> I speared the first fish , a bass of three pounds . The vibration from its struggles shot right up the spear shaft and into my hands , the fish 's weight bending the spear shaft as I lifted it out of the water . It quivered on the tines in a way that let me see into the heart of it . It was different from catching one with a pole . <p> Raymond whooped . " That 's it , boy ! " he shouted . Then he speared one , and I speared another . It was easy . The water was shallow and clear as out of the tap . There was no place for the fish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of the heat and the lack of oxygen in the water . We put our catches in the big ice chest , where they flopped around and banged against the sides for a while . <p> " We 're gon na have us a big fish fry , " Raymond said . <p> We fished out the pool . Raymond drank a beer to celebrate , and I drank a Coke . Then we slid the canoe down over the rocks to the next pool . <p> " Ai n't this a beautiful river ? " Raymond said . <p> I agreed that it was and looked forward to hearing that from him the rest of the morning , which is exactly what happened . <p> The fishing was even better in the second pool . Raymond speared a bass of at least seven pounds , a very large fish for the small river . I got a big catfish , which finned me badly in the left hand when I tried to take it off the gig . I bathed the wound in a patch of swift water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Raymond drank another beer . <p> " I reckon your mama is getting ready for church about now , " he said . <p> " And Mr. Wade is getting ready to be baptized , " I said . <p> I did n't want to talk about my mother . I had n't thought of her once since I started fishing . I wondered if Raymond had had her on his mind the whole time . <p> The next shoal was at least a mile long . We followed the main course of the water through it , trying to float the canoe whenever possible . The sun was well above the trees now , and it was hot . A breeze brought us the stench of somebody 's hog lot . Today they 'd be hosing down those hogs to keep them from dying of heat and walking chickens in the chicken houses to keep the same thing from happening to them . Raymond liked to tell the story of a bird dog he once had that got into a chicken house and killed every chicken in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens , no good at all for quail . <p> In the next pool the fish were concentrated in an area of cool water where a deep spring bubbled out of the limestone . When I walked into it , the water waist-deep , the change in temperature came as a pleasant shock . I speared a bass almost as big as Raymond 's seven-pounder . We hung on the edges of the pool and waited for fish to swim by . It was simple . After we 'd filled the first ice chest to the top , Raymond took the beer and Cokes out of the second ice chest . <p> We returned to the pool . It seemed as if the supply of fish in it would never be depleted . We whooped in delight as we speared them and taunted each other when one of us made a bad throw . I was wild with joy . I wanted that feeling of a fish quivering on the tines to go on forever . Finally , just as we filled the second chest , only a few small bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We pulled the canoe into a patch of shade . Raymond drank his last beer , and I had another Coke . <p> " They 're probably starting for the river , " Raymond said . <p> I looked downriver . There was a half-mile of shoals and then the big pool and tree swing . When I turned back to Raymond , he was crying . I looked away , knowing he 'd be ashamed if I saw him . I 'd been taught not to cry , and I knew he 'd learned the same thing . So I concentrated on that long avenue of shoals , which was rocks , clumps of river grass , and bright spots of water between green walls of trees . <p> " I reckon I 'll be living someplace else right soon , " Raymond said . I turned to look at him . He was adjusting the loop around his wrist . The rubber had left a black mark and rubbed the skin raw , just as it had mine . <p> " She wo n't stay mad for long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , over his staying out fishing all night long . <p> " It 's not a matter of her being mad , " he said . " Women ai n't like men . " <p> He waded into the pool and stood motionless , like some great extinct bird . His arm moved forward , and the spear darted into the water . He pulled in a gar , one of those long , thin fish with a mouthful of needlelike teeth . At the bank , he put his foot on it and pulled out the gig , leaving the gar to flop about on the hot rocks . He took up a position in the pool again , this time spearing a carp , which he shook off the gig and left floating belly-up . <p> " Come out here , boy , " he said . <p> I took up my spear . There was nothing in the world for me but those fish , especially the gar , which looked like it 'd swum right out of some dinosaur-filled swamp . I did n't feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the skin off my wrist . I was just as excited as before , but my excitement was of a different kind . When I had a big gar on the tines it was like I had crawled along a narrow passage into the heart of a pyramid and had opened some pharaoh 's sealed tomb , standing astonished at the glitter of all that gold . For I do n't know how long , we speared those trash fish eaten only by the desperately poor . <p> We did not stop until we had taken nearly every fish in the pool . For a time we stood there silently , both of us staring into that perfectly clear water in which nothing moved except schools of minnows and a few bream too small to be worth the effort . I felt both elated and frightened , still so excited that the spear shook in my hand . <p> " We got every damn one of them . " Raymond said it without heat , coldly , with an absolutely flat and inflectionless voice . <p> I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished I had not speared a single fish I did not intend to eat or watch somebody else eat . <p> We left the pool and sat sweating in the shade , sharing the last can of warm Coke , which tasted and smelled of fish . The water 's surface was littered with dead fish , which soon would swell and rot in the heat . I looked up , expecting to see vultures circling , but the sky was clear , not a single cloud or vapor trail to mar that expanse of blue . <p> " Let 's go see Marion Wade get himself baptized , " Raymond said . He paused . " This sure is a beautiful river . " <p> I gazed out over the pool and tried to think of something to say , but I could think of nothing . The water was perfectly calm , shining in the sun like polished metal . <p> " Yeah , this sure is a beautiful river , " Raymond said again . He looked at me , as if expecting me to agree . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss the baptism , " I said . <p> We walked the canoe down and arrived at the tree-swing pool . From time to time Raymond had checked on the fish . Some ice was left , but not much , and he was worried about them going bad . He kept talking about the big fish fry he was going to have , how my mother would make hushpuppies and Cole slaw and we 'd invite all our kin . <p> We beached the canoe and climbed the ladder to the platform . No one was at the low-water bridge yet ; we had a good view through a screen of branches . Then we heard the sound of tires on the gravel . <p> " It 's them , " Raymond said . " I wonder if Marion 'll change his mind . " <p> " Would he do that ? " I asked . <p> " You can never tell about Marion , " Raymond said . <p> I thought about Marion being cleansed of his sins in the same river where we 'd fished . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't that at all . And nobody would care if we killed every carp and gar in the river . It was something else , but I could n't put a name on it . <p> " What happened back there ? " I asked . <p> " Where ? " he asked . <p> " At the pool . Where we speared all those fish . " <p> " We killed some fish . That 's all . " <p> I could tell he did n't know , that it was something he did n't understand . And I did n't expect him to understand , but it seemed to me that I should be able to . I could also see that not understanding did n't bother him . He could kill every fish in that pool every day of his life . <p> " Look at ' em , " he said . <p> I peered through the screen of branches and saw Marion Wade dressed in a white robe being led by the preacher and the deacons down to the water . A big crowd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sinner . I saw my mother , wearing a blue dress , standing on the low-water bridge . <p> " I wonder if that old bastard has got cancer , " Raymond said . " I wonder if he knows he 's going to die soon . Hedging his bets . " <p> It seemed to me that the preacher held Marion Wade under an extra long time , as if he was n't sure the baptism would take unless he did it that way . Marion Wade came up sputtering and gasping for air . Everyone hugged each other , and the crowd began to sing a hymn , the sound drifting up through the trees to us . The sound of the singing made me feel good . <p> ( In the end the baptizing turned out to be a waste of time , because Marion went right back to drinking and seeing those women in Birmingham . Just before Christmas one of his women shot him and then set his Cadillac on fire with him in it to cover up the crime . ) <p> Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . <p> " Boy , you go run through the woods , " Raymond said . " Get your mama to wait for us . We ca n't afford to take the time to walk back to the truck . These fish 'll spoil in this heat . I 'll bring the canoe down when they all clear out . " <p> I went to do as he asked . I slipped out of the bushes , where I had been hiding so the preacher and deacons would n't see me and learn I had been fishing on Sunday , just as my mother was getting into her car with her sister . She did n't get mad . Later I knew that was because she 'd already made up her mind about Raymond . She made a fuss over the cut on my hand , and I tried to pretend that it did n't hurt at all , though it did . It ended up getting badly infected . I still bear the scar . <p> We hung around and waited for Raymond to show up with the canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , paddling the boat up that long pool from the tree swing . <p> " We got every damn fish in this rived " he shouted . <p> My mother and her sister laughed ; and I did too . I 'd never seen Raymond so excited . <p> Raymond did throw a big fish fry . But he did n't get a job , and one day I came home to find him gone and my mother crying . He 'd left for Louisiana to work in the offshore oil fields . <p> I graduated second in my class , beaten out by a girl from Warrior . So I got a job in the trailer plant . I could save enough money there in a year to allow me to start college . <p> The men at the plant often spoke of Raymond . His ability to find clever ways of fooling the inspectors had made him famous . It was said that in a week Raymond could leave enough two-by-fours out of a series of trailers to frame a new one . <p> My mother never mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exam . There was a course at the community college . On nights when she was n't in class and on weekends both of us spent our time reading . She was good at math problems but not so good at reading , and I helped her as much as I could . I did n't think she had much chance of passing on the first try . She talked about finding a better job in Birmingham after she got her degree , how her hands would heal and they 'd be beautiful again . <p> One April night , the day after she had finally passed the GED on the third try , we were celebrating by eating steaks . We sat out under the sweet gum tree . <p> " I suppose that Raymond has moved on from Louisiana , " she said . That was the first time she had brought up his name since he left . It had been more than a year . There was no new man in her life as far as I knew . I was dating Tanya Littlejohn , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get married after graduation . I was not so sure . I was not so sure about anything . If I married her , I would have to work at the trailer plant for at least another year before I went to the university . <p> " I reckon he has , " I said . " But he might stay a long time . The fishing 's good off those rigs . " <p> " I 'm fixing to get me that telephone-operator job , " she said . She was going to Birmingham to apply , had been talking about it for weeks . <p> My mother looked at her hands . " Raymond was always good to me about my hands , " she said . " He said they did n't bother him at all . " <p> I thought of plunging my gig into one of those long , silvery gar and then feeling the weight of the fish on the shaft . I remembered Raymond laughing . <p> My mother threw her head back and looked up at the sweet gum . " Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> As she continued to talk about Raymond , I realized he had meant much more to her than I had imagined . I hoped she would get that telephone-operator job , that she would meet some man in Birmingham who would treat her well . <p> I considered how difficult the next few months were going to be for me . I thought I was in love with Tanya . She was pressing me to stay at the plant and attend the community college . She said that my going down to the university would make her nervous . If I stayed in the hills , I could see us living in a double-wide . Our children would be baptized in the river . I wished I knew exactly what I should do . <p> My mother stopped talking about Raymond , but I could n't stop thinking about him way down in Louisiana on one of those drilling platforms . Sometimes I considered going there and getting a job myself , maybe on the same rig with him . There I would make much more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , I could come back and marry Tanya Littlejohn . We could go to the university , escape from life in the hills . No child of ours would ever be baptized in that deep , still pool above the low-water bridge . <p> I wondered if Raymond would be glad to see me . Life there was easy to picture in my mind . We would fish off that platform , because fish liked to school around the steel legs . No trash fish this time . Eating fish . Dolphins . We would catch one rainbow-colored dolphin after another , the fish iridescent , shimmering in the light . We would pull them in until our arms were tired . <p> But I never went to Louisiana . I worked at the trailer plant for a year , but I did not marry Tanya Littlejohn . There was this basketball player she had been serious about once . In July , just as I was getting ready to leave for the university , she told me she was going to marry him . I was relieved but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . We shook hands . <p> Things at the university went well for me . My second year I got a scholarship , so there was no need to return home to work in the summers . I never heard anything about Raymond . My mother never spoke of him , and I never asked . Then , in the fall of my senior year , I saw him at a football game , during halftime . <p> He looked just the same as he came up the steps . I wondered how he had managed to get a seat close to the field . A woman was on his arm , and they were laughing at something Raymond had just said . I got out of my seat and went up to him . He seemed glad to see me and introduced me to the woman , who spoke with a Mississippi accent . <p> " You come down for the game ? " he asked . <p> " I go to school here now , " I said . " How was Louisiana ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would 've been good fishing off them platforms . I work for a company that digs tunnels . " <p> He went on to explain how his job was to help with the shoring up . How they were based in Birmingham but traveled all over the Southeast . I tried to imagine Raymond down in some tunnel with a light on his hard hat , wrestling with a piece of timber . I supposed that might be a dangerous line of work , but I did not ask . <p> " You 're putting ' em in instead of taking ' em out , " I said . <p> He laughed . " Well , I was thrifty with them studs . " <p> The band was marching off and the team was coming back on the field and the woman tugged at his arm . He had found himself a real Alabama fan . <p> " You tell your mother I 'm fine , " he said . <p> " I will , " I said , knowing I was not going to mention our meeting at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Fished off them platforms . " <p> " You 'll get there , " I said . <p> He rested his hand on my shoulder for a moment , smiled , and then was gone . I watched them until they took their seats and merged with the crowd . <p> I sat down and thought about that day on the river , the feel of a quivering fish on my spear . I got all tight inside as I considered the rest of it : my mother , Tanya Littlejohn , the trailer plant . Then I realized the crowd was on its feet , everyone cheering . I stood with them and yelled too , joining Raymond , the Mississippi woman , the whole stadium , my body loose and easy , the whole of my life spread out before me like an endless open plain . <p>
