Shigeru Miyamoto , 55 , has often been described as the Walt Disney of video games . Formerly Nintendo ' s first staff artist , now its senior managing director , Miyamoto has been responsible for some of the most beloved games in history , including Donkey Kong , Super Mario Bros. and the Legend of Zelda series . <p> More recently , he has helped return Nintendo to the top through the development of the best-selling Nintendo DS and Wii systems , which have outsold their competition , redefined the industry and ushered in a new era of gaming . His latest act was creating a wave of casual and family games like Wii Sports , Wii Fit and his latest title , Wii Music , all of which encourage people to use their whole bodies to play . <p> We sat down for a chat with Miyamoto in San Francisco just days after he received the Champion Award from the Entertainment Software Association , the video game industry association in the United States . <p> I really did n't think I would have such an effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , but ... one of the things that has changed , that I was n't expecting originally , is you had arcade games and that 's where you found more of the high-end technology and graphics . And then you had the home market . I did n't think the home console market is where you would see the real advances in technology happen . But that 's obviously been the case . <p> We had a very wide audience , but what 's happened over the years and generations is video games have become more complicated and the experiences have become more in-depth and more difficult . And you 've seen society defined in two camps : gamers or nongamers . One of our primary objectives is to redefine that . One thing we did was we shifted our corporate focus to the idea of creating games for everyone , ages 5 to 95 . And then we tried to bring video gaming back to its point of origin , where video games had an interface and a way of interaction that was simple enough that everyone could enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to provide games to both groups . But what we 'll see that 's different is there is an idea that there are individual products that can cater to both audiences , I would argue . Even now we 're seeing that with a game like Wii Music . While there are so-called casual gamers who are enjoying the game very much , there are so-called core gamers who have become very big fans . What is very important for Nintendo is to continue to broaden the possibilities of all audiences . <p> There is always a tendency to look at what is successful and try to re-create it . That is the safest thing to do to remain successful in business . But what I try to do from the perspective of a designer and in working with designers on my team , I always try to encourage them to do what they can to impart a part of their personality , a bit of their creativity , their own unique flavor in their own creations . When you have technology , you tend to rely more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from the creative process , and things start to look and feel the same . <p> The relationship we have with technology is important , but rather than rely on technology to give you ideas about what you can do , it 's important to have ideas about what you want to create , and then find technology that allows those ideas to come to life . <p> Typically in designing and developing games , I 've found ... it 's my own personal experience that gives birth to ideas of games . Wii Music has been a different process . I 've been a fan of music for many years . For a long time , I 've thought about an idea of creating a game about music but I 've never been able to find the right idea to turn it into a game . But then we started developing on the Wii console , and we had a premise that it would be a central hub in the living room that everyone could relate to . For that to happen , we needed some key themes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development process , we started looking at ... what can we do with the Wii Remote that can allow us to create a music experience and we worked from there . In looking at the game after we completed it , I felt like , wow , all these years I 've been thinking about creating a music video game and without realizing it , through the development process , we ended up creating the type of experience I was longing for all these years . <p> Also with Wii Music , we thought because of the nature of music , we wanted this music game to be more about creative freedom than about specific goals . We tried to create an experience in the comfort of your living room that explores music creativity . And what happens as you play , you get inspiration of where you want to go next . It all bubbles up within you . Wii Music is a rare type of experience in which the moment of playing the game is fun for the person playing and also for the person watching . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making music by moving your body . <p> I have a much greater degree of freedom . In the past , I would develop a game and then finish it and the next question is always : What is the next game we would create ? In recent years , I 've really found that with this idea of applying the structure of video games in a variety of ways , I 've found anything can be a video game , and I 've found a greater degree creative freedom in what I want to do next and explore . <p> It reminds me of something the actress Meryl Streep once said that was interesting . She said , " Why is that even though 50 percent of the population is female , there are so few movies geared for a female audience ? " For a long time , the video game industry has kind of forgotten half the world 's population was female , and in recent years they 've started to realize it and started to make games that appeal to female audiences as well . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wii is that mothers tend to play a central role in household . We wanted to create software that ... mothers can play with their children . When mothers could look at games as something not only their kids would play but would be relevant to themselves , then we would see games spread into general entertainment for the family . <p> I feel like I 'm just an average person . I feel that taking that approach is important . You do n't know what part of your average daily life will be an inspiration . <p> " It 's important to have ideas about what you want to create , and then find technology that allows those ideas to come to life .
