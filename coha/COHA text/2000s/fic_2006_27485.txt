x What Stays the Same This is the one thing that stays the same : my husband got hurt . Everything else changes . A grandson needs me and then he does n't . My children are close then one drifts away . I smoke and do n't smoke ; I knit ponchos , then hats , shawls , hats again , stop knitting , start up again . The clock ticks , the seasons shift , the night sky rearranges itself , but my husband remains constant , his injuries are permanent . He grounds me . Rich is where I shine . I can count on myself with him . I live in a cozy house with pretty furniture . Time passes here . There is a fireplace and two acres and the dogs run around and dig big holes and I do n't care . I have a twenty-seven-inch TV and lots of movies . The telephone rings often . Rich is lodged in a single moment and it never tips into the next . Last week I lay on his bed in the nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of vision and I think he forgot I was there . He stood still , then he picked up a newspaper from a neat pile of newspapers , held it a moment , and carefully put it back . His arms dropped to his sides . He looked as if he was waiting for the next thing but there is no next thing . I got stuck with the past and future . That 's my half of this bad hand . I know what happened and I never get used to it . Just when Ithink I 've metabolized everything I am drawn up short . " Rich lost part of his vision " is what I say , but recently Sally told the nurse , " He is blind in his right eye , " and I was catapulted out of the safety of the past tense into the now . Today I drive to the wool store . I arrive with my notebook open and a pen . " What are you doing ? " Paul asks . " I 'm taking a poll , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable in your life ? " " James , " says Paul instantly . " And I suppose James will say Paul , " I say , writing down James . " No , he 'll say the dogs , " says Paul , laughing . " Creativity , " says Heidi , the genius . " I have to think , " says a woman I do n't know . " The dogs , " says James . Rich and I had a house together once . He was the real gardener . He raked and dug , planted and weeded , stood over his garden proudly . Decorative grasses were his specialty . He cut down my delphiniums when he planted his fountain grass . " Did n't you see them ? " I asked . " They were so tall and beautiful . " But he was too busy digging to listen . I lost interest in flowers . We planted a hydrangea tree outside the kitchen window . We cut down ( after much deliberation ) two big prickly bushes that were growing together like eyebrows at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds were done with their young , then Rich planted two more hydrangea trees where the bushes had stood . I do n't want to see how big they are by now , how beautiful their heavy white blossoms look when it rains . " I love what you 've done with the garden , " my friend Claudette says , looking at the bed of overgrown nettles in my backyard . I weeded there exactly once . I want to plant fountain grass out there , but first I need a backhoe . Rich and I do n't have the normal ups and downs of a marriage . I do n't get impatient . He does n't have to figure out what to do with his retirement . I do n't watch him go through holidays with the sorrow of missing his absent children . Last week we were walking down the hall to his room , it was November , we had spent the afternoon together .
