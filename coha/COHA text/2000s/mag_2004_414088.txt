Putting a premium on personal ties , this family firm thrives in the land of the giants . // A FEW WEEKS FROM NOW , PRIVATE JETS OF THE large , CEO-carrying kind will start streaming into Hailey , Idaho , for what may be the biggest annual event on the corporate calendar : Allen &; Co. ' s conference at Sun Valley . Headline names from the media , entertainment , computer , and Internet worlds-people like Bill Gates and Michael Eisner and Meg Whitman-will alight with their families and settle in for a real stretch of time , five days . They 'll listen to speeches and participate in panels , bicycle , play golf , and go whitewater rafting . And , of course , they 'll engage in the ever-riveting ( though seldom physically dangerous ) mogul sport known as elephant bumping . You 'll probably read a lot in the days ahead about the Sun Valley conference-its star power has earned it coverage in the likes of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker . But you probably wo n't read much about Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So here 's a rare look inside this very private family firm as it moves to a third generation of Allen leadership with a revamped structure and some new hands onboard . To say the firm is unusual would be an understatement . With 175 employees spread over three floors in an undistinguished building at 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan , Allen &; Co. functions in some ways like a typical investment bank , pursuing underwriting , mergers and acquisitions , and other advisory work . It is an institutional broker and manages money for wealthy individuals , including members of the Allen family . But it has no research department and has never had a New York Stock Exchange membership . Statistically the firm is insignificant ; Securities Data rankings show , for example , that in mergers and acquisitions , Allen has not ranked higher than 11th among all securities firms in any of the past 15 years . Yet Allen &; Co. is a consummate niche player . Its specialty : forging long-lasting and lucrative relationships with corporate leaders . Its latest coup : a plum role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. is at a true inflection point . Famed investor Charles Alien and his brother , Herbert , founded the firm in the 1920s . Herbert 's son Herbert Anthony Allen , now 64 , expanded the business and still watches over it today . In late 2002 control passed to his son of the same name , Herb , 37 , who keeps so low a profile that most executives in the securities industry probably do n't even know he 's now the boss . ( In an attempt to cut down the confusion , we 'll call the father Herbert and the son Herb , as the Allen office does . ) On Wall Street , where consolidation has been the rule , family firms are a scarce commodity . To have one that has navigated its way into the third generation of management , maintaining all the while a considerable mystique , is thoroughly remarkable . As part of the transition to a new generation , the firm has made a little-noticed change in the way it does business . The corporation that was and is Allen &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new limited-liability company , Allen &; Co . LLC . The original company will continue to function as an investment vehicle , with a net worth of $1 billion ( about 60% of that money is Herbert 's , and the rest belongs to his sister , Susan , and a first cousin , Bruce Allen , Charlie 's son ) . Meanwhile Allen &; Co . LLC commenced life with $40 million of capital , which came from the Allens , though a number of employees are being given stock . So it is not exactly his father 's $1 billion company that Herb is driving . Why so little capital ? Herbert says it was his son 's choice ( as in " I can handle it from here , Dad " ) . Could n't you argue that the underwriting business could easily use more than $40 million or so of capital ? Answers Herbert : " If they need more money at any given time , we " - that is , Allen &; Co . Inc. - " can always lend it to them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The overlapping entities with similar names are characteristic of the Allens ' merchant-banking business , which takes stakes in clients and other companies and does arbitrage . Herbert Alien has often described that operation as featuring " circles around circles of investing . " By that he means that when an attractive place to put money surfaces , the firm invests , its people invest , Allens personally invest , until the mind reels at sorting things out . Under any structure or boss , Allen &; Co. will continue its entrepreneurial and opportunistic ways , and personal relationships will reman the key to its success . Take the case of Google , the season 's must-have IPO . One of the firm 's bankers , Nancy Peretsman , knew Google 's president , Eric Schmidt , at Princeton and has patiently worked , as Allen &; Co. habitually does , to build a client relationship . The payoff came when Google announced the names of the 31 underwriters that would handle its IPO . Allen is slated to be in a small group of firms just below the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if the timing of Google 's offering does n't get in the way , one or both of the company 's young co-CEOs , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , will be at Sun Valley ( as will Schmidt ) . Joining them will be Allen 's three marquee clients , Rupert Murdoch , Barry Diller , and the newest Coca-Cola CEO , Neville Isdell , on whose board Herbert sits , sometimes knocking heads . ( See " Coke : The Real Story " on fortune.com . ) The kind of person-to-person banking that Allen practices has paid off nicely . Each of the past four editions of the Forbes 400 has estimated Herbert 's wealth at $1.8 billion . Asked recently about the accuracy of that figure , Allen claimed not to have a clue what he is worth but also snorted , " Forbes has no idea , and neither will you . " About us , at least , he 's largely right : There 's no way of knowing , for one thing , exactly what Herbert received from his father during his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well he 's used whatever money he got . But if you poke behind the economics of Allen &; Co. ' s recapitalization in 2002 , you can determine that since the mid-1980s the firm had been returning more than 40% a year to its shareholders . That 's sweet-very sweet . Almost everything about the Allens ' world signals wealth . The walls of Alien &; Co. ' s wood-paneled offices are filled with the superbly chosen American paintings Herbert began collecting when he was young and unable , he says , to afford the impressionist works he really wanted . The office also holds a large collection of T.D . Kelsey 's prized Western sculptures , an indicator of the affection that the Aliens feel for that part of the country . Herbert has a ranch there , in Cody , Wyo. , that he himself calls " paradise , " that the son loves as well , and that Warren Buffett , annually a guest , says is so wonderfully comfortable and luxurious that it might even beat Omaha as a place to live . Herbert has other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mater , Williams College , and in Southampton , N. Y. When in New York City , he lives in a Carlyle Hotel apartment with Donnie , his 10-year-old black Labrador . Donnie often spends the day in Herbert 's office and travels regularly with him . At one point Coca-Cola 's Atlanta hotel of choice for its directors was the Ritz-Carlton , which did not allow dogs . So Herbert and Donnie stayed at a nearby motel . Today Coke has switched to the Four Seasons , which welcomes dogs-and therefore Herbert Allen also . As all this suggests , Herbert is now single , though he has been married and divorced twice ( the first time to Laura Parrish , the mother of his four children , and next to Ann Reinking , the Broadway dancer ) . He is often accompanied today by Gail Holmes , a Colorado breeder of cutting horses . Herb , the son , has been married for five years to Monica de la Torre , a public-interest lawyer who is a native of Puerto Rico . They live on New York City 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Charles , 35 , whom his father calls " happy-go-lucky , " works at Allen &; Co. as an institutional salesman and is not married . But do not worry about any lack of fourth-generation in this family : Herbert 's two daughters , Leslie and Christie , have eight children between them-five girls and three boys . Talking to Herbert and Herb , you can sense their respect and affection for each other . The father is tall , athletically broadshouldered , fast-talking , unassuming , and witty . He 's given to spurts of both surprising candor and impenetrable reserve . Son Herb has the same self-deprecating manner and athletic build-he played lacrosse for Yale-and is persistently diffident . " Compared to him , " says his father , " I 'm outgoing . " The son at this point is short of the confidence his father exhibits and generally shuns the spotlight . But he does enjoy digging into the guts of , say , an Allen investment or the firm itself , whereas the father is typically bored by details . " If my dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " says Herb . " But that 's not toxic for me . " Herbert has even been known to tune out in a Coke board meeting , having at one of them blocked the minutiae he was hearing about Sarbanes-Oxley and begun to think about ( as other directors heard later ) how to spell the title of the 1940s song " Mairzy Doats . " Herb the son joined Allen in 1992 , at first spending his time searching for highly speculative stocks-the $2 kind-to go into the firm 's eclectic portfolio . Today , a year and a half into the CEO job , he gets excellent marks from many people . " He 's very smart , he listens , he has a great sense of humor , " says institutional investor Michael Larson , who runs Bill Gates ' money . He 's also made himself into a good public speaker , says Larson , where once he was n't at all . Inside Allen &; Co. you would n't expect to find many vocal critics of the boss . Nonetheless , the praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 69 , the firm 's senior banker : " He 's a terrific young person , quite bright , very curious , and serious in a constructive way . " Shuman does remember one period a few years ago when some people in the office thought Herb seemed more interested in golf than in the firm . " But it has got to be difficult , " Shuman says , " when your father runs a place to come in and do something helpful without feeling like you 're getting in the way . I would have played golf too . " Herb is continuing the firm 's distinctive ways while slightly remaking the mold . On its investment-banking side , Allen &; Co. has a peculiar operating system in which its senior bankers are viewed as " profit centers " who basically run their own businesses . In this " silo " arrangement-we 're simplifying a little here-a banker is paid , on the spot , 30% of any M &A; and advisory fees he generates . From that money he must cover certain expenses , such as travel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefty costs of signing up other Alien bankers to help with the deal . What 's left over is his to keep . For both the firm and the profit-center crew-a dozen bankers strong right nowthe system has an appealing simplicity : You produce , you get paid . Nancy Peretsman , 50 , who has been at Allen nine years , remembers that things really did n't work that way at her previous employer , Salomon . There , she recalls , the investmentbanking bonus committee arrived tortuously at decisions that were " fundamentally subjective and political . " Her opinion : " What we 've got at Alien is much fairer . " And highly lucrative as well . Alien bankers like Stan Shuman , who has worked on Rupert Murdoch 's deals since the mid1970s ( the two met through their 4-year-old sons , who were best friends at a Manhattan nursery school ) , and Enrique Senior , 60 , who works with Coke and its bottlers , have clearly made fortunes . For Allen the big drawback of the system is that it is not well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken a couple of remedial steps . First , 5% of the advisory fees and underwriting dollars that come into Alien &; Co. now go into a bonus pool for the young bankers , a.k.a. the " support staff . " Second , Herb , acknowledging the firm to be less than a " bastion of teamwork , " has been setting up procedures for getting his top bankers out of their silos and into meetings that can foster cooperation and school the younger set . Or the older set , for that matter . One of the newest additions to the profit center roster is Bill Bradley-yes , former Senator and presidential candidate Bill Bradley-who after the 2000 elections joined up with old friend ( and fellow Democrat ) Herbert Allen . Bradley , 60 , has n't done any deals yet , but he 's delighted with what he calls the " values " and " long-term thinking " he sees at his new place of work . His summation of what Alien provides its clients : " honest , direct , and discreet advice . " Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg-who arrived at Allen with all sorts of sports world contacts that are already generating deals ; he 's been hired , for example , to help sell the Milwaukee Brewers . Arriving at Allen in early 2002 , Greenberg found the silo system completely at odds with his fondness for collegiality . But Herb 's efforts to get people working together have been very heartening , he says . He also empathizes with Herb because he knows what it 's like to have a larger-than-life father . Of course , it took Herbert Allen a while to achieve that intimidating stature . He arrived at the investing partnership of Alien &; Co. in 1962 bearing an " indifferent " record as a student- " Williams should really have thrown me out , " he says-and zero knowledge of the securities business . Four years later he was named president of a new corporation , also called Allen &; Co. , which his uncle , Charlie , and his dad , Herbert , had set up to handle underwriting and related activities . It was n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " The corporation had to have a president , and they could n't find anyone else to take the job . " He was 26 . After that the company sailed through good years in the market and endured bad years that sent it into the doldrums . It pulled off one notable deal in 1973 , when it bought control of Columbia Pictures for the bargain price of less than $4 a share . ( The Hollywood foray embroiled the firm in a scandal four years later when Columbia president David Begelman was charged with forgery ; Herbert Allen came under fire for being too soft on him . ) But Alien &; Co. ' s true watershed year was 1982 . That 's when it launched the Sun Valley conference , and when Herbert Allen hooked up with Coke . For starters , the deal made a bundle for Allen &; Co . After some intense negotiations , Coke bought Columbia in July 1982 for about $750 million in cash and stock , of which around 6%-or $45 millionwent to the Allen " circles around circles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen establishment has about $445 million of Coke stock ; $310 million of that belongs to Herbert personally . Beyond that , the relationship has had a deep impact on both Coke and Allen &; Co . Herbert says there 's almost no way of overstating what this new , " accidental " Coke connection did for his firm 's reputation : " It was like you were a parish priest , and the Pope comes along and says you 're okay . " There was an immediate reaction , he recalls : Business poured into Allen simply because it had gained Coke 's blessing . Coke also became a business papacy directly sprinkling its carbonated beverages on Allen &; Co. ' s investment-banking business . The firm has handled around 15 different deals and underwritings for Coke and its affiliated bottlers , and earned millions in advisory fees as well . The deals included Coke 's 1986 creation of CocaCola Enterprises , a $1.2 billion IPO . At $16.50 a share , CCE was aggressively priced and did n't sell well . As managing underwriter , Allen had to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was tight and uncomfortable around here for a while , " says Herbert . But the rescue cemented the firm 's relationship with Coke . Of course , not all deals ended quite so happily . Prime example : Coke 's proposed $16 billion purchase , in 2000 , of Quaker Oats , which owned Gatorade . Douglas Daft , then CEO of Coke , incautiously let the deal get all the way to a boardroom showdown ( from which Herbert Allen recused himself ) . There , dissenting directors , including Warren Buffett , whose Berkshire Hathaway is the largest owner of Coke , killed it . Buffett 's argument was simply that Quaker 's assets did not seem worth the price . Later Pepsi , paying less , bought Quaker-and other investment bankers , not Allen , walked off with the spoils . While Coke was sending business from Atlanta to New York , Herbert Allen was becoming an increasingly influential Coke director , with sometimes controversial results . Allen established close ties to the company 's CEO , Roberto Goizueta ( who died in 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately Keough , upon his 1993 retirement from Coke , became chairman at Allen &; Co. , where he is highly valued today for his contacts , business sense , and gregarious Irish charm . In keeping with the firm 's all-in-the-family ethos , Keough 's son , Clarke , is an institutional salesman at Allen &; Co . As FORTUNE described in its recent cover story , Keough , named not long ago to the Coke board , has played a strong-too strong , his critics in the article argued-behind-the-scenes role at Coke while the company whipped through two successors to Goizueta , Douglas Ivester and Douglas Daft , and signed up another , Neville Isdell . Herbert Allen , too , has not been shy about exercising his power when he 's unhappy with Coke 's management . In late 1999 , most notably , he joined with Buffett in ousting Ivester . Choosing not to consult the rest of the board , the two directors met Ivester at a Chicago airport hotel and told him he had lost their confidence . Conceivably Ivester could have fought back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead he flew to Atlanta and resigned , stunning the other directors . Allen has no apology except to wish that the board had been wiser , earlier . " Where we really missed the boat was in not questioning Ivester 's getting the job in the first place , " he says . " He was way over his head . " But denying Ivester the job would have meant ignoring Goizueta 's apparent wishes , and nobody on Coke 's board was good at that . In fact , the most questionable events in the long , close relationship between Coke and Allen &; Co. came when Herbert was head of Coke 's compensation committee , a job that 's now off-limits for him because he does n't qualify as an independent director . Goizueta sought to be a compensation pacesetter , and Allen helped make him one , time after time . A particularly interesting moment came in 1995 , when Allen learned that Goizueta wanted to be awarded one million options . " It was n't that Roberto cared about the money , " said Allen recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his record . " Allen , in any case , asked Buffett 's opinion . Buffett , no fan of options generally , did not like the idea . But recognizing that Goizueta had added immense value at Coke , Buffett told Allen that if Berkshire had happened to own 100% of the company , he might well have set up a comp system that would have paid Goizueta even more than he 'd earned . So Buffett told Allen he would not oppose the grant . And it was made , going on the record as one important and unfortunate milestone in the long , crazy climb in executive pay . Let 's turn back to the other momentous event of 1982 , the starting of the Sun Valley conference . It was an idea whose time had not really come : Herbert Allen initially had to beg clients to attend . But today the problem is keeping the crowd down to the 300 or so adults who will fit into Sun Valley 's main conference room . Essentially Alien needs three kinds of people at Sun Valley : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Herbert Allen 's genius to encourage his attendees to bring their children and turn them over to armies of babysitters . This hospitality induces guests like Bill and Melinda Gates to bring their three kids and stay for the full five days , not just the one that might well be Bill 's maximum at some other kind of gathering . The CEOs are obviously needed for their presentations and brainpower . " Sun Valley , " says Disney 's Michael Eisner , " is a cross between summer camp and an SAT test . " Eisner , of course , also was a participant in a famous deal first discussed on a roadway in Sun Valley : Disney 's 1996 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC . For that transaction , Allen was later paid $2 million for providing Cap Cities with a fairness opinion . The institutional investors are essential in this picture because Allen wants their business and gets a large amount of it-often simply because of Sun Valley . Lacking analysts , Allen tends to turn to what it sometimes calls " direct research , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate executives at small meetings that the firm has arranged . If you will pardon the topographical dissonance of this comparison , Sun Valley is the Mount Everest of direct research . The 50 or so institutional investors who come to the conference are apt to be media experts or value investors or just big , powerful buyers like Larson , Bill Gates ' money manager . Larson says he finds himself using the firm for a broad range of trades . In equities , he adds quite amazingly , Allen is probably his No. 1 broker . If you 're Allen &; Co. and have a success like Sun Valley , you might want to try a second such event . Indeed , Herb started a small-cap conference in Arizona five years ago . Among the presenters have been the CEOs of companies like Activision , TiVo , and Ask Jeeves . But do n't expect a lot to change at Allen &; Co . When he is asked what the firm may look like ten years from now , Herb says it will have stuck to its principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specialize in something like health care-and expanded its moneymanagement business ( headed by his first cousin , Bradley Allen Roberts ) . Beyond all that , he feels the firm will just need to see where its business goes . " If you had asked me ten years ago where we 'd be today , I doubt that I would have said we 'd be doing a lot with companies that are making progress in the Internet world , " he says . " But we certainly are . " One thing that 's definite : There wo n't be bureaucracy . " Right now we have only two committees , fire safety and sexual harassment , " Herb says , " and my job is to see that we do n't get a third . " Another is that the firm will not grow much overall . " If you are n't small , you ca n't really focus on relationships . " His father has stronger words . " I do n't think there 's a firm on Wall Street that 's been improved by size , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . Salomon was a great small firm . " And he lets the thought hang in the air . Of course , Herbert points out , the large firms have an advantage in one respect : While regulators may fine them heavily for transgressions , they probably would not take the momentous step of closing a big firm down . " Us ... " he says . " If we did something wrong , they 'd close us down in a minute . " As one precaution against that , he adds , he has a compliance officer who has the skills of-and he apologizes for the term-a " Gestapo agent . " Even so , he 's asked , how does a firm like Allen really guard against some errant employee doing it in ? " Well , " he answers , " you walk the halls . You look and you watch and you see everybody . You know who 's a drunk and who 's chasing skirts , and if they 're chasing skirts , whether they 're buying jewelry or dinner . If they 're only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rundown you get a sense that the boss of a small firm like Alien needs to perform certain tasks that maybe are n't on the agenda of a Stan O'Neal at Merrill Lynch or a Hank Paulson at Goldman Sachs . From all that the Allens say and do , you also get an idea that this family firm might just stay around for a long time . Fourth generation , anyone ?
