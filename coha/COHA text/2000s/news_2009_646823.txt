BOSTON  --  Mike Krzyzewski has been coaching non-stop for more than a year , guiding the USA to an Olympic men 's gold medal in August before returning to Duke , where he has led the Blue Devils into tonight 's NCAA round of 16 showdown with Villanova . Rather than draining energy from the 62-year-old , three-time national champion , the whirlwind schedule has empowered him . <p> " I 'm a little bit surprised at how fresh I am , based on the last three years with the Olympic team , " he said . " I 'm about as fresh as I 've ever been at the end of a year . " <p> Krzyzewski will need to be sharp if the Blue Devils are to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2004 . Villanova throttled UCLA by 20 points in the second round and has a win this season against top seed Pittsburgh . <p> Duke was knocked out in the opening round of the 2007 tournament by 11th-seeded Virginia Commonwealth and lost to West Virginia last year in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue Devils have advanced without marquee names , unlike former teams that featured players such as Christian Laettner , Bobby Hurley , Grant Hill , Shane Battier , Shelden Williams , Elton Brand and Jayson Williams , all of whom had national recognition . <p> " We 've had good talent in our program during the last 25 years , " Krzyzewski said . " But a few years ago , with guys going pro , all of a sudden we hit a period where we had all these young kids . I 've seen them grow up and stick to the work . <p> " We have n't had a bad practice or an attitude problem . It 's been sensational , really . " <p> Krzyzewski has juggled his lineup and shifted personnel more than in any of his 29 seasons at Duke . <p> " I told my team at the beginning of the year that they would all be evolving and I would coach them a little bit differently , " he said . " Like ( senior ) Dave ( McClure ) , I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , do n't have your ego hurt , because the next game you might play 30 . They 've been really mature about that , and it 's worked out . " <p> The changes began immediately when senior guard Greg Paulus  --  who had started 95 games over his first three seasons  --  began coming off the bench . Krzyzewski has used eight starting lineups ; 11 players have started games , and nine average at least 11 minutes . <p> " Guys are still getting better , " Krzyzewski said . " We went to a different lineup 11 days ago that produced a whole different dynamic . <p> " We have some guys who are really good situational players . It 's a little bit like a pro team . It 's like in the Eastern Conference , one guy might not play against Philadelphia , but against Boston you have to have him . " <p> After Duke lost four of six games starting in late January , including a 27-point loss at Clemson , Krzyzewski shifted junior Jon Scheyer from a wing to point guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Blue Devils are 10-1 since . <p> " I distinctly remember thinking that was the change that needed to be made , " sophomore forward Kyle Singler said . " With our personnel , ( Coach Krzyzewski ) had the right pieces . " <p> Smith suffered a concussion when he ran into a pick set by Maryland 's Dave Neal on Feb. 25 and missed the last three regular-season games . He returned for the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament and has been one of Duke 's most effective players off the bench in the postseason . <p> " We would not have won the ACC tournament or advanced without Nolan , " Krzyzewski said . " His role has changed maybe three times during the year , but the one he 's in right now is tremendous for our basketball team . <p> " We 're playing our best basketball of the season . ( Against Villanova ) we just have to be ourselves and do n't let what they 're doing change our personality or do n't let the stage that you 're on change who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Singler averages 16.5 points and Scheyer 14.9 . The face of this team is junior swingman Gerald Henderson ( 16.8 points ) , who credits Krzyzewski with pushing all the right buttons when the Blue Devils were in a tailspin . <p> " When we need it , we get strength from him , " Henderson said . " I 've said all season , his passion is something I 've never seen in anybody before . I think winning the gold medal has given him even more passion . " <p> Krzyzewski has taken the same philosophical stance with this Duke team as he did with his Olympians . <p> " I told our Olympic team and I told our team , we need to play because of anticipation , not expectation . Anticipation gets you forward ; expectation inhibits . I thought our team has done that , especially in the last few weeks . " <p> High praise from peer <p> Villanova counterpart Jay Wright said this year has been Krzyzewski 's best coaching effort at Duke . <p> " I think what he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowing what he 's doing this year , " Wright said . " The move putting Scheyer at the point was genius . <p> " I think all of us , coaches and players , have great respect for them . We love how their team plays . " <p> Duke is competing in its 33rd NCAA tournament , and Villanova is appearing in its 30th . Together they have won four national championships ( Duke , 1991 , ' 92 , 2001 ; Villanova , 1985 ) . But the schools have not played each other since 2000 ( a 98-85 Blue Devils win ) and are meeting in the tournament for the first time since 1978 ( Duke won 90-72 ) . The Wildcats are 3-7 in the series , and their last win came in 1958 . <p> " It is kind of strange  --  you 'd think Duke and Villanova would have matched up more , " Wright said . " It 's two teams that a lot of basketball people have said to me , ' We love how you play . <p> " We definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players know their players very well . It 's pretty cool . I think it adds to this game . " <p> Villanova has won eight of its last 10 games five schools to the regionals , both NCAA records . The Wildcats start three seniors and two juniors and have a bench as deep as Duke 's . <p> Senior forward Dante Cunningham will be playing in his 11th NCAA tournament game and junior guard Scottie Reynolds in his seventh . Cunningham is the team 's leading scorer ( 16.3 points a game ) and rebounder ( 7.3 a game ) and was voted the Big East 's most improved player . Reynolds has scored 20 or more points 31 times in his career and shoots 81% from the foul line . <p> " Coach Wright has a certain philosophy that plays hard , and Coach Krzyzewski , they take the same approach , " senior forward Dwayne Anderson said . " We 're similar in many ways . " <p> Cream of tourney rises <p> Duke and Villanova are representative of the basketball royalty jammed into this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing rate , with this year 's collection setting an NCAA record . <p> Since Villanova won its championship in 1985 , just under 61% of the teams reaching the Sweet 16 have been top-four seeds . Midmajor double-digit seeds such as George Mason in 2006 and Davidson last year are n't part of this year 's story . <p> " There is an upside to having the underdog ; there 's a downside , " said Mike Tranghese , who is retiring in June after serving 19 years as Big East commissioner . " The thing is , you 've got marquee names in this tournament now , I mean really big . You 've got eight unbelievable games , and I think the public gets excited about great games . " <p> Gary Walters , who chaired the NCAA tournament selection committee in 2006-07 , does n't think the absence of Cinderellas has damaged the tournament 's appeal . <p> " I personally believe it 's always good copy to have an Horatio Alger team  --  somebody working hard and getting to the top , " Walters said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Having said that , one can also make the case that you have some of the really stronger schools from the bigger conferences ( facing each other ) . And I 'm sure people see the charm in that . <p> " I would like to see a couple of ( midmajors ) alive , but the bottom line is they 've had the opportunity . My own feeling is that this just happened to be a year when the midmajors were n't quite as strong as they have been in the past .
