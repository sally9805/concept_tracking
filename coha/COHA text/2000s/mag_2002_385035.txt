He 's happy ( at least , that 's what his wife tells us ) , pain-free ( although his neck is killing him ) , and talented ( about that , we think there is no dispute ) . His show , Curb Your Enthusiasm , is the funniest thing on television . He has more money than God . He even looks good in corduroy . What more could Larry David want ? Do n't ask . BY SCOTT RAAB Photograph Photograph " Dour ? I 'm not . No . I think there was a point-I could 've been described that way in the seventies and eighties . In the seventies and eighties , I did n't have any money , I was living hand to mouth , I was in fear every night of going onstage . There were weeks when it was awful . So , yeah , why would n't l be dour ? I was n't getting sex with any frequency . " // TO LOOK AT LARRY DAVID  --  bespectacled , bald , and basset-eared , a long  --  limbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipping lukewarm decaf-you would never glean his anguish . To hear him whistle as he works , tilted back in his office chair , whistling and humming , laughing at his own image on the TV screen , you would not sense his suffering . Even knowing his show-HBO 's Curb Your Enthusiasm , a halfhour Sunday-night faux verite schmuckfest starring David as himself , the ex-New York City stand-up who cocreated Seinfeld and has stewed wealthily ever after out here in Los Angeles , drenched in self-loathing-still you would imagine , to watch him in the editing room , that he is a happy man . You would be wrong . He is a touchy man , Larry David . A touchy , touchy man . If you doubt this , pay him a compliment . Call him-as I do when he takes a break-a comic genius . " Are you out of your mind ? " I did n't make it up , I say . Comic genius : That 's the tag . " What tag ? " he shouts . " Where 's the tag ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom Shales-America 's least unknown TV critic-wrote that you were a comic genius , flat-out . And he 's not the only one . " Genius tag-what is that ? That 's ridiculous . What the hell does it even mean ? " His arms are crossed . His legs are crossed , too . His endless brow furrows above narrowed eyes . One hand snakes up to knead the base of his neck . I spot a small bottle of hot sauce on his desk-Cholula-and attempt a soothing transition . Cholula , I say . Good stuff . " I do n't think I 've ever had it in my life , " he says . Sorry if I 've made you uncomfortable , I say . " Oh , no . No . This is just a natural state . It 's a natural state . This is not a sign of discomfort for me . " He purses his lips , balloons his cheeks with air , and blows it all out , nice and slow . " Genius , " he moans . " That 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if people ever read anything like that . " His anger and despair are half joking , but no more than half . One of Curb Your Enthusiasm 's pleasures is watching a man without a boss or a job , a man with a name , half a billion dollars , and a loving wife , piss vinegar and blow up over a parking space . It is somehow reassuring to know that even in what passes for his real life , all his money and acclaim ca n't protect David from his own vanity , shame , and gloom , or force him to enjoy being ... Larry David . He knows this much : The end of him is coming , yes , as it comes to every man . Meanwhile , things fall apart . In the roaring of God 's silence , in the face of certain doom , Larry David is a noiseless , ceaseless echo : one Jew kvetching . " HE 'S HAPPY , " Laurie David , his wife , insists . " He just does n't want anyone to know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's the most loyal , sweet person you 'll ever meet . This guy ca n't go past an empty restaurant without feeling guilty-like he should be eating in there , helping them out . He 's such a softy . " But comedy is melancholy work , a tough job for a softy . Something bad must happen for comedy to click ; mockery must be made . Someone had to be the first to crawl from the cave and inch along the glacier 's rim , only to slip and slide back down , cracking his skull . And somebody else had to watch , busting a gut . Stand-up is even worse : You crack open your own head , pause for the laugh , do it again-but bleed funnier this time . You 're the heir of every jester who displeased his king and wound up bent upon the chopping block . The last sound he ever heard was the tinkle of his bells ; his exit line was , " Prithee , I killed in Saxony . " You 're that someone now-the loser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll die up there one night . In 1970 , Larry David graduated from the University of Maryland , went back to his native New York City , found a tworoom apartment with two roommates , made the rounds of employment agencies , drove cabs , sold bras , worked as a paralegal , and got fired from or quit every job he ever held . Then he went to a comedy club one night and thought , I can do that . He was right . He was cerebral and skewed , distant and deadpan . He was brilliant . He just could n't take the dying . He 'd open by thanking God that he had not been born a wealthy Spanish landowner , " because I could never be sure about whether to address the help using the tu form or the usted form . If I use usted , I do n't want them to think I 'm being condescending . But if I use tu , I do n't want them to feel so familiar that they think they can just help themselves to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his death-camp stuff . " You know , " he 'd muse , " if he 'd given me a compliment , Josef Mengele and I could have been friends : Larry , your hair looks very good today . " Really ? Thank you , Dr. Mengele ! " ' And : " You know what I really admired about Hitler ? He did n't take any shit from magicians . " Fellow comics adored him . Most clubgoers , drooling for their ration of Dice Clay dick jokes , loathed him . Loudly . " I was in fear every night of going onstage in front of these audiences , " David recalls . " I knew I had to go on , but I really did n't want to . It was bad . There were some bad nights . if I was bumped-So-and-so came in and you ca n't go on ' ' - that was fine . That was great news . " Sometimes David would bump himself , just stalk offstage in the middle of his set . Sometimes fights would break out between hecklers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurie David met him then , years before they married . She was Letterman 's talent coordinator . He was ... Larry David . " He was a mess , " she says now . " No future , no dough , no potential . When we first started seeing each other , I literally sat down with a girlfriend , and on a paper place mat I wrote " Pro ' and Con . ' The " Con " list had fifteen , twenty things on it . He had this disgusting apartment . He had a cup and a spoon . He was this comedian who 'd walk off stages if everybody was n't paying attention . He refused to travel , refused to go anywhere . He never did anything to try to be successful , not for one second . He just pursued his craft . The " Pro " list had one thing on it : He 's funny . " In 1988 , NBC gave one of David 's stand-up buddies-the less overtly twisted and far more ambitious Jerome Seinfeld-a shot at a sitcom pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. to help create a show . It worked out pretty good . David wrote sixty-odd scripts , and for the first seven seasons of Seinfeld 's nine-year run , he poured his soul 's bitter sap over every episode . He became a rich man . He became a Los Angeleno . He became a comic genius . Yet he was still ... Larry David . He was still the same guy who had moved to L. A. , briefly , ten years before , to write and perform on Fridays , ABC 's lousy copy of Saturday Night Live , and , earning real money for the first time in his life , bought himself a convertible . Cruising Santa Monica Boulevard one day , top down , he was at a red light when some yutz waiting for a bus recognized him . " Your show stinks ! " the guy hollered . David pulled the convertible over and put the top back up . " It was never down again , " he says now . " Never . " Sixteen years later , newly armed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius bought himself a Porsche . He did n't crave a Porsche- " a 911 , " he says , " whatever it was " - but Seinfeld , who has collected two of every three Porsches ever built , had been hocking him about how great they are and taunting him about the old-fart Lexus David was driving . " Then I heard they had the Tiptronic , " David says , " which is an automatic . Okay , now I can get it , because you do n't have to shift . I did n't want to shift . There are other things to do in the car-radio dials , food every now and then , you want to take a note or two . Why would anybody want to shift ? " David drove his new Porsche for a week before returning it to the dealer at a loss of twelve grand . " I was so self-conscious driving it that I could n't pull up anywhere I was going . Even a restaurant-I would park blocks away . I was too embarrassed . " When I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry thought that people actually gave a shit that he was driving a Porsche . He thought people noticed . In L. A. " David , who now drives the gas-electric-hybrid Toyota Prius on his show and in what passes for his real life , shrugs at the memory . " I could n't adapt , " he says . " I was uncomfortable . " " WHY WOULD I do anything ? " David asks as we walk back to the editing room from lunch . " I never do anything . " Come on-anything you want . " If I never do anything , " he says , " it would be very odd for me to do something , do n't you think ? " I thought we discussed going to Disneyland on the phone . " I would n't even go there with the kids , " he says . " I hate it . With a passion . " The Davids have two young daughters , which is no small miracle when you consider how hard it was to drag David to the altar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David , " and it took three years to get him to do it . He went through a period where he had cold feet . Literally . His feet were ice-cold all the time . He was always ordering special slippers to get his feet warm . We 'd go into a jewelry store , and I 'd look at a ring and look over , and he would n't even be in the store . He 'd be out on the street His neck got bright-red with hives every time he went into a jewelry store . It was a total nightmare . He was so panicked . He was afraid that he would n't be funny anymore if he was happy . One day I just gave him a martini , and we got on a plane and went to one of those drive-in places in Las Vegas . Nobody cared that we did n't have a wedding . Our families were just glad it was done . They could n't take it anymore . " Three years ? I 've got two days here . Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed Homer accompanied ox-pronged Achilles to a Thracian brothel-requiring the subject and the writer to do something quirky and pseudo-revealing together . Since the invention of kneepads , this activity has nearly always been mediated in advance by the star 's publicist , but David employs no publicist , rejects any definition of star that includes him , and is n't exactly eager to do anything with me . Look , I tell him , Sean Penn does very little press , and he took me out on his boat . " That 's one place you would never get me to go . I ca n't stand boats . I would never get on a boat . God , do I hate them . " Drew Carey and I went bowling . " Uh-huh . " Hey , Albert Brooks went with me to the Universal Studios theme park . We went on two rides . " He did that ? I ca n't believe it . " He did . So , Disneyland ? " Why ? The lines- " If there are lines , we 'll leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say never but did n't want to hurt my feelings . He 's such a softy . SAFELY BACK in the editing room , David sits and begins to rotate his shiny egg of a head while kneading the base of his neck . His face is an old man 's grimace . When he 's finished , he resumes whistling-snatches of some vaguely familiar , opera bouffe air I ca n't quite place . " Always a big whistler , " Seinfeld confirms later . " Master of the obscure musical reference . I 'd say , Wait , I know that ; it 's the Ronzoni jingle , is n't it ? ' It was like working with a calliope . " Curb 's narrative structure is invariably Seinfeldian-the pebble of a mishap dropped into a pond ripples and builds to a tsuris tsunami-but the streamers tied to David 's gnarled maypole of an id now flap free of any network standards and practices . It always was a delight to see what David managed to slide past the censors at NBC when Seinfeld reigned : onanism , cunnilingus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George Costanza 's fiancee ; fleecing a child with severe immune deficiencies out of victory at Trivial Pursuit . Curb Your Enthusiasm , though , makes all that seem like Touched by an Angel . In the final scene of the episode he 's working on this afternoon , David climbs out the window of a theater ladies ' room after getting hugged there by a prepubescent lass who has rushed out of his arms and into the crowded lobby , screaming , " Mommy , Mommy , that bald man 's in the bathroom and there 's something hard in his pants ! " The viewer knows that the hard thing in David 's pants is a water bottle he 's attempting to hide , but the folks in the lobby do not ; David 's leaving through the window because he hears them coming to lynch him . " It 's a funny show , is n't it ? " he asks as the credits roll . " It might be my favorite . " It 's not easy , picking a favorite . Two prior episodes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typo in a newspaper obituary David wrote to honor his wife 's aunt . Last season , at a meeting of incest survivors , David devised a fictional incident of his childhood abuse at the wandering hands of an imaginary uncle . Here , pedophilia . Next season-bestiality ? Photograph In case you 're wondering , it 's half empty . // " Yeah , I 'll probably tackle it , " David says , smiling . " I actually have an idea for it . If you ca n't take the high dive , what 's the point ? I do n't feel that 's risky at all-because I know it 's making me laugh . I know if we can execute it the way I see it , it 'll work . I mean , to me , there 's not even a chance that it wo n't work . " Whatever works : That is the kamikaze 's credo and the comic 's . If he crashes and dies , it wo n't be for lack of stomach . And if watching Curb leaves you loathing Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's fine . Just as long as it makes him laugh . Even on his worst nights doing stand-up , he never doubted his chops ; that soft , David never was . But Seinfeld taught him that commercial success could be more crushing than stand-up-comedy failure , brutal to sustain , a treadmill to creative oblivion . David assumed the Seinfeld pilot would never make it , and when NBC liked it enough to ask for four more episodes , he began unraveling . " I had no confidence , " he says . " I was n't interested in having anything to do with television . That only came about because of my relationship with Jerry . I was living in New York , doing stand-up at night , fucking around , getting by . I had a car , I was playing golf , I had no responsibilities . " Four shows-all right , it was n't that traumatic . Maybe somehow I could write four shows . Somehow . So we do the four shows , and I 'm thinking , Okay , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up for thirteen . Thirteen shows . ON my God-that 's impossible . I ca n't do it . I 'm welling up with fear and anxiety . I feel myself starting to cry . " Then it gets picked up for another twenty-two . All of a sudden I 've got this huge undertaking that I am emotionally ill-equipped to handle . It was so big . It was like , Yeah , cancel the show . Take me out of my misery-because I do n't think I can do this . " Even as he mounted the summit of the sitcom world , David remained ... Larry David . Each season , he prayed that NBC or Jerry would pull the show 's plug . Each year , he frayed a little more under the pressure to keep topping himself . In 1996 , he quit the highest-rated sitcom on television-quit writing , quit producing , and quit watching it . And-being Larry David-not with any sense of triumph or success . " People would say , You deserve it . I 'd go , What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't deserve anything . " As for his Seinfeld money , it 's a running joke on Curb . When David confronts a network exec about swiping shrimp from his take-out order , the guy hollers , " You know what , Larry ? Take your $475 million and buy yourself some fucking shrimp . " And when David 's manager loses his Lakers courtside seats after David trips and injures Shaquille O'Neal , David asks what he can do to make up for it and his manager screams , " Buy the team ! " If Larry David is n't happy , it 's not the money 's fault " I like having it ; I 'm not Donna deny that . I never made more than $7,000 a year until I was thirty-two . I had my share of so-called character-building years . It 's great to have it . But I was n't happy when some of those numbers were published . People look at me and go , Oh , you must be so happy . Nobody knows what 's going on inside a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter who they are . " WHEN I SEE HIM still rubbing his neck and grimacing at the office the next morning , I ask him about it . " I have a condition . I 'm not in pain-I just ca n't turn too well . I have n't had any range of motion in my neck for fifteen years now . It 's the muscles . There was a time when I was in pain , but I 'm not anymore . " So let 's go get a massage . My treat . " I do n't like to indulge myself like that . Somebody working on my body for an hour-I feel like I 'm wasting my time . " All right , here 's the plan : We jump in the Prius and drive to the Museum of Tolerance . It 's five minutes from here . " You 're not serious . The Museum of Tolerance ? " Come on . Five minutes . " What 's in the Museum of Tolerance anyway ? " I 'm not sure . It 's some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go to the museum and mock the Holocaust . You want to end my career . " He 's not even half joking now ; maybe he 's not joking at all . He has seen careers wither , fade , and die . Another running joke on this year 's Curb is David 's fruitless , season-long effort to pitch a new sitcom , based on the rigor mortis suffered by Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus-played straight by Alexander and Louis-Dreyfus-cast forever in the shadows of their Seinfeld characters . And David has had his own near-death experience : Sour Grapes , the movie he wrote and directed after Seinfeld . It was not good , and it did not do well . " I survived it , " David says . The kamikaze has it good . The comic has to die and live to die again : His life is shtick ; shtick is his life . The point where David 's Curb persona ends and the man himself begins is n't easy to discern , not even in the mirror . " The person on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says with dour cheer . " He 's not as bright , but inside , he has more character . Id rather be the person on the show . " Whatever cries and whispers lurk in Larry David 's depths are flung up on the screen in Curb-or lodged tightly in his neck . You need n't love yourself to be a narcissist ; you can be just as transfixed by self-loathing . But to milk your misery for laughs and money , that is some kind of genius . Screw happy : If your deepest fear is of not being funny , then happiness is a threat , not a goal . David 's boyhood chum Richard Lewis , the Yid in black beside whose self-lacerating comedic stylings David 's are but a hymnal whisper , once persuaded David to see a psychotherapist , many years ago , back in New York . " I recommended mine , " says Lewis , who often pops up on Curb whining in disharmony with David . " We 'd go to group with the doctor , and afterward we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night he just stood up and said , I 've had it . I do n't want to hear you people . You 're not helping me , I ca n't help you-this is insane . ' " He just stormed out of this person 's house . The whole group ran after him , ten neurotic people chasing a guy fleeing from therapy . He wound up in a phone booth . I said , Larry , come on-you should go back . ' He said , I 'm not coming out . ' We ultimately all left , and I do n't think he 's been in therapy since . " Larry gets to his neuroses not from a Method school-he 's the Olivier of neurosis . I do n't think in real life he suffers that much internally . I hope not . His obsessiveness is to make good art and be a good father and husband . I think . I say that about people , and then you read the next day that someone was dressed up like Peter Pan on top of a bicycle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discomfort trumps any notion of personal transformation . " I realized I could speak to this person every day for two hours for the rest of my life , " David says of therapy , " and I 'll be exactly the same . All you 're doing is exacerbating everything by exploring yourself so deeply . It 's too much . You can learn too much about yourself I think there 's a limit . " David is happy doing Curb-ten episodes a season , shot on the fly , documentary-style , with a few pages of outline and no censors  --  perhaps too happy . Being Larry David , he yearns to return to what he failed at best : stand-up comedy . " I think I finally could get an audience who would be on my side . I 've never done it under those conditions . I 'd like to see what that would be like . Once you 're up there and you 've got the right audience , there 's nothing like it It 's not something that you forget . I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudzhed David to tour with him for years without success . " It would be fun touring , " Lewis says , " doing some gigs with him , and I think it would be great for people to see him live . Now he would be able to handle that heckler . " Seinfeld is less sanguine . " Now that he 's got a little celebrity , maybe it would be different . But not that different . Standup is a very unforgiving medium . And a Richard Lewis-Larry David double bill would be some sort of neurosis-protein  --  shake spectacular . " Laurie David is altogether dubious about her husband-with or without Lewis-getting back up there again . " I do n't see this happening so fast-because to get your act together , you have to hit the clubs . You have to travel . And we all know he 's not traveling . He 's not going anywhere . " He 's certainly not going anywhere with me . No Disneyland . No massage . No Museum of Tolerance . When he mentions that he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dice . He points at my tape recorder . " I feel sorry for you , " he says . " Having to go through all those tapes-it 's not gon na be good . Whaddya got ? Nothing . You got nothing here . I 'm bad at these things . I keep seeing what I 'm saying in print and I freeze up . I warned you . " Warned me ? You invited me to come . I flew out here during wartime for this . Out of Newark , for pity 's sake . " Was anyone else on the plane ? " Yeah-Norm Mineta and the Sri Lanka Hotfoot Ballet Troupe . " You know , normally I love a good pall , but this is beyond pall . Anything where the society as a whole would be depressed would probably have buoyed my spirit a little bit-but not this . This is a bit much . Those are nice sneakers , by the way . " You do n't think the laces are a trifle long ? " They 're making laces long these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go into editing with him , too ? " No . Look , do n't worry about this story . I 'll make you look good . " I do n't care . If you called me up and said you 're not gon na write it , I 'd say that 's great . I would encourage you not to . " But you might not like the part where I leave my wife and son back at ground zero and you wo n't go anywhere with me . How it was too much of a favor to ask of the big-shot comic genius to go to Disneyland . " That 's very funny , " he says . " That 's fine . Just keep away from the genius thing . That 's embarrassing . I do n't want people reading about that . They 'd have to lock you up if that 's what you thought about yourself . You would n't be able to walk around in society . " God forbid . Why , that would make you ... Larry David . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
