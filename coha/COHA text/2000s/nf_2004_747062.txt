Although the terms " empire " and " imperial ( as in " The British Empire " and " Her Imperial Majesty " ) call up images of grandeur , in the colonies the business of empire was often quite humdrum and meant getting involved in the most detailed aspects of the lives of the common subjects , including those of the fast-growing urban underclasses . One of the places where the urban underclass of a rapidly expanding , densely populated , multicultural , imperial port city becomes visible is in the Aden Residency Records for the first half of the twentieth century . Prostitutes under close surveillance of local policemen ; female organizers of zar ceremonies pushed out of business by religiously up-standing , middle class male opponents ; bumboatsmen competing for licenses ; 1 ex-slaves fleeing back to their masters to escape the hardships of coolie labor ; and hapless urban immigrants frantically petitioning against official deportation all come into view , however briefly , in the Aden Residency Records . <p> This urban underclass , however , experienced British influence mostly through local intermediaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian clerks and administrative assistants ) belonged to the local bourgeoisie , while others ( such as policemen , petition writers , and " peons " of various kinds ) belonged , sometimes only barely , to the working class . Since , in Aden as elsewhere , law was one of the major instruments of colonial transformation , colonial courts are important sites to observe the nitty-gritty and the " down and dirty " of imperial and colonial transformation . <p> Aden was occupied by the British in 1839 and became dramatically more important after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 . As it developed into an international coaling station , it attracted labor migrants  --  both from its own rural hinterland and from across the seas  --  most of whom joined the swelling local working class and urban poor . At the same time , a colonial middle class emerged associated both with trade in all its aspects and with the colonial bureaucracy . Apart from a short hiatus in 1917 , Aden was administered from British India until 1937 , when it was transferred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence from Britain in 1967. 2 <p> The Aden Residency Records for the first half of the twentieth century include a number of files dealing with the two positions of government qadi of the colony , those of the two neighborhoods of Aden and Sheikh Othman . They do not include the actual court records or qadis ' registers ( sijills ) , although those were kept at the time , but consist of the administrative files kept  --  in English  --  on the qadis ' affairs by Indian and British officials and include correspondence  --  in Arabic  --  addressed to the latter by the qadis. 3 <p> The records throw light on the work of the government qadis as they performed the marriages , legalized the divorces , and settled the disputes of their clients in accordance with the prescriptions of the Shafi'i madhhab ( school of law , or legal orientation ) and the legal texts associated with it . Especially when the qadis ' decisions or actions came into dispute and attracted British administrative attention , the records contain great detail about the legal rulings and reasonings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself new to scholarship about Islamic law . It is the ways in which they shaped and were shaped by the specific context of early twentieth-century British Aden that increases our understanding both of Aden 's urban society and the history of Islamic law . Collier 's 1975 insight that " legal action does not occur in an isolated legal sphere but can only be understood in relation to the wider organization of socio-cultural life , " while now a truism , remains valid , for in this case too the records only yield new knowledge if we place the information about the law in the context of the surrounding community. 4 Sally Merry , a specialist in legal anthropology , spoke about her work in the colonial court records of Hawai'i as " ethnography in the archives . " In her case , this meant understanding the court cases of the colonial courts in the context of both local networks and power relations and global processes of economic and political change . Since the Muslim community of Aden that comes into focus in the records is small-scale , highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily interactions ; and since many of the parties associated with the administration of Islamic law in Aden ( the British and Indian officials of the Resident 's Court , the government qadis , and other religious officials , as well as common petitioners and plaintiffs ) represent themselves in these records in " their own words " - however historically constructed and mediated - the " ethnographic approach to history , " as Merry calls it , characterizes this essay well. 5 <p> This paper consists of three parts . First , it will briefly sketch some aspects of the everyday working life and context of the government qadis who are documented in the records . Then it will present the history of the position of government qadi in the colony and trace the steep decline in the official functions and authority of the qadis under British rule , including the qadis ' relations with the court of the ( British ) Resident , the institution created to control and displace them and transform the law they administered . Finally , the paper will examine some concrete legal disputes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aden and Sheikh Othman in 1906-1907 , disputes that were all related to the issue of contracting minors into marriage or , in today 's parlance , child marriage . They provide the most concrete illustrations of how Islamic law was shaped by both colonial institutions and processes ( the court of the Resident and the British commitment to legal reform ) and by local relationships , especially the competition between the two qadis and the legal initiatives of the common Muslim men and women they traditionally served . The Everyday Life of the Government Qadis <p> The government qadis of Aden ( the urban quarter of the Crater ) and Sheikh Othman ( on the western bay ) emerge from the archives for the first half of the twentieth century as men who were an integral part of the urban society they served . Although their official powers declined throughout the period 1854-1937 , as we will see , they were respectable and influential members of the local , " native " ( mostly Indian and Arab ) middle class . For example , their signatures appear on petitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imams of mosques and other religious officials , school teachers , government and company clerks , and merchants. 6 The first government qadi to be appointed was an Arabic teacher in the government schools . These schools were also the source of other colonial qadis , including some of those sent across the sea to British Somaliland . The first qadis ( perhaps up to 1881 ) may have been locally born and trained , but later ones the British brought from Zabid , as they regarded religious education in Zabid and Ibb more highly. 7 <p> From the records , the qadis appear to have been relatively well off . They did better than other government clerks because , in addition to the monthly stipend they received , they also charged fees for their services . When it checked on the position and financial status of the qadis in 1907 , the administration found that the qadi of Aden , jointly with his brother , owned two houses , had a monthly stipend of Rs. 50 and earned Rs. 80 rupees in fees each month . The qadi of Sheikh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and earned a monthly stipend of Rs. 40 and Rs. 110 in fees. 8 <p> A good part of the work of the government qadis consisted of performing and registering marriages and divorces . The fee for a marriage performed at a private home was Rs. 5 , that for one performed in the qadi 's office Rs. 1 , while that for a divorce was Rs. 2 . These fees do not appear to have changed in the period under study here in contrast to the qadis ' monthly stipends , which varied between Rs. 40 and Rs. 80. 9 <p> The records contain examples of the marriage certificates the qadis produced . Certificate No. 647 , for example , included the date of the contract ( 23 May 1934 , or 10 Safar 1303 ) ; gave the names of the groom ( Muhammad Ahmad Gul Muhammad ) and the bride ( Halwo bint Hasan ' Ali , ' Ayyal Habar Jalo her Somali clan ; indicated that she was thayyib ( single but not a virgin ) and appeared to be - both by looks and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her father was alive but absent on the Somali Coast ( barr al-Sumal ) , as she attested to ; gave the name of the wall ( or the girl 's guardian ) , who was the qadi ; indicated that the amount of the mahr was 200 riyals , and attached the names of those who were witnesses to the identity of the couple and of those who testified to the choice of agent ( al-wakala ) and the contract ( al-'aqd ) . 10 <p> In general , qadis registered the marriages and divorces carefully , it appears . This was necessary , of course , if only because a divorce required the payment of the mahr stipulated before witnesses and registered at the time of the marriage . Thus the qadi answered a request from the British Agent in Jedda to verify the divorce of a Somali woman there promptly , quoting the number and date of the entry in the divorce register. 11 <p> The qadis ' registers were supposed to be both correct and up to date . In July 1906 , the superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's court and the nemesis of the government qadis ) discovered that the marriage and divorce registers of Qadi ' Umar ' Abdallah Sharaf of Sheikh Othman were about one year behind . The qadi wrote back to explain , promising to do better in the future : " The reason for the delay in registering them marriages and divorces is the numerous cases which come to us every day and night owing to the poverty of the people and their ignorance . " 12 <p> The qadis made other mistakes as well , and the fact that they were sometimes unofficially aided by a deputy did not always help . Thus , in July 1906 , the scribe for Fatima bint Hassan , an angry bride who had been divorced by her brand-new husband under pressure from the brother of the latter 's first wife but had not been told about the divorce , lit into the qadi in a complaint to " the Assistant Resident , Judge Aden " - in return for his fee , the qadi should ask the divorcing couple about the reasons for the divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice to the divorced wife . In this case the qadi had not only not done so but had , moreover , taken the groom 's word for the mahr he owed his second wife ( 10 riyals less than the register showed ) , although this was later corrected . In this case the bride 's petition was written by someone , perhaps a relative , who was an Arabic teacher and therefore a servant of the government . " If the qadis treat people like us this way , he sneered , how do you think they treat the common man ? 13 We learn more about the challenges of the job of the government qadis in Aden in part three of the paper . <p> The qadis were indeed busy men . In 1906 , the qadi of Aden , Sayyid Muhammad bin Hassan al-Hazmi , backed up his request for a paid assistant to the British with recent statistics on his workload . Between 1901 and 1905 , he claimed to have written 572 letters , with a total of 3,668 lines . In 1907 , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,218 letters and ruled on 1,466 cases. 14 In either case , this indicated the high number and great variety of cases handled by the government qadis at that time . The British did not grant the qadi a paid assistant , but some qadis nevertheless had an unofficial deputy-in one case a brother - who performed marriages in their absence and often drew up letters and contracts . As time passed , the qadis only got busier . A 1923 report to the First Assistant Resident notes : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The administration apparently got good value for the funds invested in the qadis ' courts . In 1920-1921 , the government 's expenses for the office of the qadi of Aden amounted to only Rs. 936 , of which Rs. 50 were the qadi 's monthly stipend , Rs. 10 his war allowance , and Rs. 18 the rent of his house and office . The Sheikh Othman qadi cost the administration even less , namely Rs. 813 , of which Rs. 40 were the qadi 's monthly stipend , Rs. 8 his war allowance , Rs. 12/13 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " peon , " and Rs. 37 for miscellaneous expenses such as clothing the peon. 16 <p> The reason for the 1923 inquiry was the administration 's desire to replace the qadi 's " Somali orderly " ( or policeman ) , who also translated for him , with " a Somali peon from the court as we are short of police . " 17 The report explained why this was not possible : " A policeman is necessary with the view to keep order . The Kadies office is a semi-judicial court and has apparently to deal with cases in which mostly low-class and illiterate persons of turbulent nature are concerned . " 18 When the administration decided to withdraw the orderly in November 1930 , the qadi protested the decision one last time . He needed the orderly for many reasons , he argued : to keep order in his court , for his security , to accompany him to private houses , and to translate " Somali + Indian " for him . The authorities sometimes even sent him sepoys , he contended , especially when many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases are heard by us at night times from 7 to 11 and 12 P.M. , in order to give facility to the working class whose presence during the day times will interfere with their duties , particularly those living at Tawahi , Maalla , and Khor Maksar. " 19 The records leave no doubt that the qadi was to a large extent the qadi of the common people of Aden 's urban working and lower classes. 20 <p> It is evident that many people trekked across town to come to the qadi 's court in Aden , from neighborhoods as far away as those of Tawahi , and Ma'alla , and Khor Maqsar , mentioned above . The residents of Tawahi were dissatisfied with this . In 1919 , they asked the Resident to allow the qadi of Aden to travel to Tawahi twice a week and open an office there . Realizing that this would mean extra office rent and travel expenses , the administration refused. 21 In 1924 , the petitioners tried again . They wanted to either have their own imam appointed as third government qadi or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Othman , visit them on a regular basis . Moreover , they offered to come up with office space themselves and just asked for travel money . They argued that it was difficult for working people like themselves - " poor people and servants in companies " - to find the time and afford the transportation ( by gharry , or horse-drawn cab ) to come to Aden . The qadi , after all , traveled lightly , they noted , as he carried only three books , the marriage and divorce registers , perhaps , and the Minhaj alTalibin , the most popular legal text in the colony . Moreover , as Tawahi had grown , the administration had increased clerks in all departments , so why not expand the qadi 's services ? 22 <p> The qadi of Aden , afraid to lose his income from this constituency , raised objections . He argued that cars had become cheap and that he already made special arrangements for his more distant clientele . He worked both evenings ( from 7:00 P.M. to midnight ) and Sundays , always serving those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of qadis were increased , it would be even easier for the people to play them off against each other . However , if he were to be compensated for his food and travel , he would visit Tawahi once a week . The British , wanting neither more expenses nor more " confusion , " again refused. 23 <p> Apart from officiating at marriages and divorces , the qadis also set the ceremonial calendar of the Muslim community they served . Determining and publicly announcing the exact beginning and end of the month of Ramadan ( and the Fast ) was a crucial part of this work . The qadi of Aden provides a description of how this was done in 1926 , when a dispute erupted between him and the qadi of Sheikh Othman about the end of Ramadan . Qadi Muhammad Da'ud had both consulted with astronomers and " traveled to the high hills " himself , and had failed to see the new moon . On his return , however , he received a note from the other qadi , that of Sheikh Othman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furious , as he regarded this his prerogative and because no witnesses were mentioned in the note , Qadi Muhammad traveled to Sheikh Othman to confront his colleague and check on the witnesses . By then the inspector of Ma'alia had instructed a drummer to announce the end of Ramadan , while the imam of Tawahi had refused to do so . An ugly confrontation took place , as well as some tumult in some of the mosques . In the end only the qadi of Sheikh Othman and about thirty of his followers broke the Fast on that day , the rest of the community following the qadi of Aden . <p> A few days later , both qadis were called in by the Assistant Resident and told to work together . This did not stop them from proceeding to explain themselves further in writing . The qadi of Aden argued that the other qadi had neither the authority nor the competence to establish the end of Ramadan . He had yelled at him and assaulted him and should be punished . The qadi of Sheikh Othman , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct procedure and had not overstepped his authority . " I am not directly under him but an independent official , " he explained , " besides I am senior to him in service &; draw more pay than him , " thus revealing the deeper reason for the conflict. 24 <p> Disputes about the sighting of the moon are an old and long-standing expression of separate communal identities in this part of the Islamic world . We will see below how the qadis also used a non-traditional legal issue - high on the British agenda for legal reform - to pursue their rivalry . <p> Of course the government qadis were not the only Islamic judges and scholars serving the inhabitants of Aden ; they were just the only government qadis . Different ethnic and religious communities contracted the marriages and settled the affairs of their own members , as was still the case when J.N.D. Anderson visited Aden in the early 1950s. 25 Thus , in 1920 , a small Indian regiment in Tawahi applied to have its own imam appointed as a qadi . This was rejected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform and register marriages and divorces in his community. 26 <p> The different Shi'a communities normally settled their own affairs , independent from the government qadis . Only once do the records reveal a dispute resulting from the qadi 's involvement in the marriage of a Shfite individual . The case was that of a young man of the Bohra ( or Isma'th ) Shi'ite community , who contracted a marriage in front of the qadi of Aden in June 1916 . This caused quite a row , partly perhaps because he was the stepson of the highest authority of the Bohra Shfite community of Aden , Sheikh Muhammad ' Arif , who had been the qadi of Bohra Shi'ite community for 27 years . The young man had married ( on an impulse , if one believes the testimony of his relatives ) a barely divorced Somali woman . The parents , who considered this " unlawful , shameful , and disgraceful , " and against the standards and customs of their community , tried every angle to invalidate the marriage . They petitioned for over two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple , questioning the authority of the qadi over Shi'ite ceremonies , and arguing that the woman had remarried within her ' idda ( or legally prescribed waiting period ) . In the course of events , the registrar of the British Court investigated other Bohra marriages performed by the qadi - he found ten such marriages in the period 14 July 1906 and 6 May 1916 - and was moved to write a small treatise about ' idda according to the authoritative legal texts of various madhhabs . But the British did not interfere and those young Bohra men set on contravening the custom and control of their communities continued to have this legal option open to them. 27 <p> Mostly , however , the government qadis dealt with Arab , Indian , and Somali Shafi'i Muslims in accordance with Shafi'i law . Pressed by the needs of their vast urban clientele , many of whom they , in a port city like Aden , could impossibly know personally , the qadis lived moreover under the continuous surveillance of the British . Their relationship with the British administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next section . Islamic Law as Colonial Law : The History of the Office of Government Qadi <p> The office of government qadi was a British creation dating from 1854 , fifteen years after the occupation of Aden . The qadiship of Sheikh Othman was added to that of Aden itself in 1881 , when that area was bought from the sultan of Lahej , who gave his permission for the appointment. 28 <p> Of the first qadi ( if he indeed was a government qadi ) , we know only the name , Sayyid Muhammad b . ' Abd al-Rahman , and the date of his removal , 1859. 29 He was succeeded by Sheikh Ahmad b . ' Ali , an Arabic teacher in the government schools , who served from 1859 until his death in 1873 . In local memory , he appears to have been remembered as the first government qadi of Aden. 30 Qadi Ahmad was succeeded by Fahi ' Ali b . Hassan ( or Hussein ) , who served only one year and resigned on February 19 , 1874 . This qadi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who " refused to guide themselves by his decisions in matters of religious observances. " 31 A dispute about his determination of the end of Ramadan " finally ended in a tumult which was raised at his house " and the Resident felt that he had to let the qadi go . When other officials wanted to take measures to support the qadi 's authority , the Resident noted " that the functionary was appointed for the comforts of the Mahomedan community " and could not be kept on against its wishes. 32 <p> On 12 March 1874 , the Resident approved the appointment of Qadi Muhammad b . Sulayman , about whom the records consulted here are otherwise silent . Sayyid Hassan b . Muhammad al-Hazmi took up the qadiship in 1881 , and was succeeded by Sayyid Yahya Muhammad al-Hazmi , who left office in 1901. 33 Sayyid Muhammad b . Hassan al-Hazmi then served from 1901 until 1918. 34 His brother , Hammud b . Hassan , served as his deputy and , in 1929 , was selected to the qadiship of Berbera in British Somaliland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Muhammad Da'ud al-Battah was qadi of Aden . <p> The first qadi of Sheikh Othman to be mentioned by name in the records is Fahi ' Abd al-Rahman b . Najm. 35 He was succeeded by four qadis who were closely related , from the ' Abdallah Sharaf family . ' Abdallah had been a wealthy port officer , who had served the British without pay . His son , ' Umar Abdallah became qadi first , succeeded respectively by his son , Muhammad ' Umar ' Abdallah Sharaf ; his brother , ' Awad ' Abdallah ( who served from 1918 to 1929 and retired at the age of 56 ) ; and , finally , by ' Abdallah 's grandson , ' Abd Allah ' Umar ' Abdallah , whom the records show on active duty in the early 1930s . <p> The days of Qadi Ahmad of Aden appear to have been the heyday of the government Qadis in Aden , for he had great authority and wide official powers . The administration paid him Rs. 60 per month , allowed him to keep the legal fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a courthouse . The early qadis performed marriages and divorces and gave legal rulings on matters of inheritance and custody . However , Qadi Ahmad was not just a keeper of civil records and a legal advisor but had both civil and criminal jurisdiction . Thus he had the authority to settle civil cases up to the value of Rs. 200 , 36 and , according to a retrospective report of 1905 , " could commit defaulters to the Civil Jail , and at times even the Criminal Jail . " " As regard the administration of the estates of deceased persons too , " the report noted , " the Kadies used to wield great powers and to manage large estates and settle rival contentions regarding them without reference to Court . " 37 The qadis ' authority and involvement in large estates made them important players in the urban society of Aden - a role further enhanced by their authority to issue certificates of sale , mortgage , and transfer of property and to charge fees for such services . <p> However , such official sanction for the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the death of Qadi Ahmad , the administration appointed a registrar to the Resident 's Court , " invested with powers of a Judge of a Court of Small Causes and Suits , the amount or value of the claim not to exceed Rs.20. 38 If the office of government qadis had been created to control and limit the authority of other religious officials and qadis of the communities of Aden , the office of the registrar to the Resident 's Court was created to limit the powers of the government qadis . The tension between this office and that of the qadis was thus structural and continuous . <p> The first occupant of this office was Mr. Muncherjee Rustomji , who received a monthly salary of Rs. 20 , much less than the qadi of Aden. 39 He was succeeded ( after 1903 ) by K.N. Koyagi , who died in 1906 40 and was , in his turn , succeeded by Bahader Khan Sayyid Rustomali , who served into the 1920s . It is Rustomali whose attempts to deny the government qadis all judicial and legal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1907 , his desire to see the qadis reduced to mere registrars of marriage and divorce and legal advisors to the Resident 's Court led him to present as fact what still was mostly administrative intention . Thus he claimed that all judicial powers had been withdrawn from the qadis in 1873 and that even Qadi Ahmad had lost the authority to commit the debtors and disobedient to custody and was instead required to report them to the presiding British magistrate. 41 In reality the processes by which the qadis lost their judicial and notarial powers and functions were much more gradual and incomplete than the registrar claimed . <p> Thus it is clear that the duties of Qadi Hasan of Aden in 1881 still included judicial functions : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In 1893 , the qadis still exercised official some judicial authority ( " settled religious affairs " ) , issued certificates of sale , and managed some estates . Assistant Resident Stace wrote in that year : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In that same year , the qadi of Sheikh Othman was authorized to write certificates of sale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exceeding Rs. 99 in value , to keep a record , and to charge a small fee . In 1905 alone , he still issued 65 financial certificates , of which 61 dealt with real estate ( mostly " kutcha , " or reed mat , houses belonging to Aden 's poorer inhabitants ) . 44 <p> The second registrar , Rustomji , opposed these powers of the qadis. 45 In 1896 , he called illegal the qadi 's habit of charging a fee for certifying heirs , " as the court legally receives the probate duty . " " I would not permit the Kadi to write out mortgage deeds , " he grumbled , " as he has religious scruples about inserting clauses regarding interest , and inserts other clauses which lead to litigation . " He added in the same vein , " I would not permit him to write deeds of gifts , as such deeds , unless they are registered , are void , and consequently must be written in English . " The qadi could write deeds of sale of houses , the registrar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the qadi " should not mix himself in other contracts. 46 <p> However , the records show that the qadis ' official powers gradually declined . Thus Registrar Koyagi reported in 1905 that the qadis had lost the official authority to handle inheritance or to " deal with any estate , however small the property ( not even to pay the funeral + give balance to the court ) . " 47 " At the present day , " he claimed , " the Kadis merely report to and give advice to the Court concerning all such estates except those of very trifling value . " 48 By 1908 the qadi of Sheikh Othman had lost the authority to issue certificates of sale. 49 In that same period , the officer in charge of Aden Settlement explicitly referred to the qadis as " court officials " ( not judges ) , " directly responsible to Resident . " 50 This was repeated in 1909 . In 1914 the Resident stopped the notarial powers of the qadi of Aden. 51 In 1914 Registrar Rustomali upbraided the qadis for communicating directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the registrar of the Resident 's Court , i.e. himself. 52 The list goes on . When a dispute reached the Resident 's Court , as in the case of the Bohra youth marrying below his station in 1916 , the registrar would even report on the details of Islamic Law ( such as the minimal length of the ' idda ) , as if he were a qadi. 53 <p> By 1919 , the qadi of Aden 's monthly stipend was much lower than it had been in 1860 , 54 indicating the limited value officially placed on the qadis . This relative disrespect is obvious from a report in 1920 . April 7th found Qadi ' Awad Abdallah of Sheikh Othman in police custody . He was accused of buying stolen wood , but , to the qadi , the real issue was Mr. Richardson , the superintendent of Sheikh Othman , who " is bent on degrading me . " This was obvious not only from this arrest , Qadi ' Awad contended , but also from his insistence that the qadi collect his pay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was against the prevalent custom of years which upheld the respectability of the Kazi saving him the degradation of mixing with workmen , coolies , sweepers , etc. assembling there on pay day , a matter which has not ended yet and owing to which my two months pay still remain unpaid. 55 The records do not tell us whether the qadi was convicted , but his request that his case be transferred from the authority of the superintendent to the Resident 's Court was rejected. 56 <p> Although the records from which this essay draws have many gaps , the colonial administration 's official intent to reduce the government qadis to mere keepers of the civil register and on-demand legal advisors is beyond doubt . The best witness to the government 's long-term success is the well-known scholar of Islamic law , J.N.D. Anderson , who did field research in colonial Aden in the early 1950s . At that time , " the so-called Qadi , " Anderson concluded , " is no more than a ma ' dhun or registrar of marriages . " 57 <p> Andersen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qadi , reported that this was " a cause of some dissatisfaction in the Colony . " 58 This dissatisfaction seems to have been threefold . First , one of the dissatisfied parties was the qadi , who , Anderson reports , still remembered that , " in the past ... the court had sometimes enforced the decisions of his predecessors , but this practice had fallen into disuse . " 59 That the qadi also expressed dismay at the content of the Islamic law applied in Aden , as we will see below , further attests to his relative powerlessness . <p> But officials associated with the British Court , the very people who had usurped the powers and functions of the qadi from 1860 onwards , were also dissatisfied . Given the " remarkable dearth of both textbooks and law reports to help an English court in deciding points of Shafi'i law , " Anderson reports , " it is felt that litigation before a local qadi would be both cheaper and more expeditious. " 60 The third dissatisfied party consisted of the local Muslims themselves , Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were accustomed ... to have recourse to their own courts in such matters . " 61 There is little doubt then about the final outcome of the processes that took judicial powers and functions away from the qadis of Aden . <p> Nevertheless , colonial prescriptions for reality do not constitute that reality . Off the ( British written ) record , the qadis continued to settle civil disputes , especially those of the poor and powerless . Traces of this are visible in the disputes that attracted British attention in 1906-1907 . The third part of this article will focus on some of these disputes and examine the legal issues that came to dominate the correspondence between the qadis and the Resident 's Court in this period . Performing Islamic Law for Colonial Masters : The Qadis of Aden and the Issue of Child Marriage <p> In the year 1906-1907 the relationship between the qadis and the Resident 's Court ( especially with the registrar , Mr. Rustomali and the First Assistant Resident , Captain F. de B. Hancock ) was characterized by a number of disputes that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of child marriage . There appear to be three reasons why this was so . First of all , child marriage and intercourse with a child bride were actually occurring in Aden , with grave physical consequences for the girls involved . Second , opposition to child marriage had been central to the British agenda for legal reform for a long time . In British India it had been a dominant issue as early as the 1850s . There , the age of consent , as it is called in modern parlance , was raised to ten years in 1860 and twelve years in 1891. 62 In Aden too , legal reforms had focused on child marriage . By 1906-1907 , the period of the documents under study here , intercourse with a minor wife had already come to be considered rape and a husband committing such a rape was sentenced to imprisonment. 63 It was these reforms that made the civil suits described below even possible . Finally , the reality that child marriage occurred and that it was the focus of British legal reform , coincided with a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheikh Othman , which expressed itself in mutual accusations of performing child marriages and played itself out in front of the officials of the British Resident 's court . For each case , the records provide short notes and comments by these court officials and the statements of the parties and the original witnesses , as well as letters by the qadis. 64 Each case offers glimpses of the elements of Islamic law that were at issue , the relationships between the two qadis and between them and the Resident 's Court , and the relationships between common men and women . The account below will discuss five disputes described in the records : the dispute about Zamla bint Aid of August 1906 , in which the qadi of Aden , Sheikh Muhammad , accused Qadi " Umar of Sheikh Othman ; the dispute about Safiya bint Husayn , of March 1907 , a similar accusation ; the dispute about Khadija Diriya , of March 1907 , in which Qadi " Umar struck back at Qadi Muhammad ; the dispute of Asiya Muhammad , which put Qadi Muhammad in the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the qadi of Aden took revenge by embarassing the British administration . Let us briefly examine each of these . <p> The Dispute about Zamla Bint Aid : <p> An Accusation Against Qadi " Umar of Sheikh Othman <p> The accusation that Zamla was a minor came first from Sayyid Muhammad Hassan al-Hazmi , qadi of Aden , in a letter to Captain Hancock written on 13 August 1906 . It is immediately obvious from the letter that Qadi Muhammad was less interested in Zamla 's fate than in accusing Qadi ' Umar of careless and unlawful behavior and endangering the public weal . This is his story : On August 23 , 1904 , the qadi of Sheikh Othman , Sayyid ' Umar ' Abdallah , had married Zamla b . Aid to ' Abd al-Ghaffur Sulayman , while she was a minor . Since the girl was a minor , her uncle was not a valid agent . He had married her in her absence and despite the fact that she had informed him of her objection to the marriage . Thank God , the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had the said girl fallen into the hands of a wicked person , he would have ravished her and the matter would have been very serious . " " It appears to us , " he added , that the husband had left her alone owing to her being a minor and to his knowledge of the Law of the Govt. , " which regarded such an act as rape. 65 The qadi insisted that the government take action , partly because child marriage was against Islamic and government law , 66 and because , if Qadi ' Umar was not forced to conduct appropriate investigations before performing a marriage , it might be feared " that he would encourage the people in such matters , " with - given their ignorance - grave consequences . <p> On September 20 , 1906 , in a letter addressed to Sayyid Rustomali , Qadi ' Umar defended himself , bringing both legal and social arguments to the fore : 67 First of all , he contracted the marriage only after the witnesses had declared that Zamla had reached puberty and had appointed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Islamic law , he explained , if Zamla was of age , then her uncle was one of her lawful guardians . But even if he was not a lawful guardian ( that is , if she were a minor ) , then he could still contract her into marriage if there was necessity ( darurah ) . If the purpose of the marriage was to avoid hardship for the girl , he argued , then some Shafi'i texts and Hadith allowed even an outsider to marry her off . The qadi proved his points further by discussing three extracts from " Bughyat al-Mustarshidun , Fatawi Sayyid " Abd al-Rahman Mashur , No. 188-189. " 68 <p> After presenting his legal reasoning , the qadi raised two practical points based on medical and social realities . First , he had the testimony of an employee of the Sheikh Othman dispensary that Zamla had reached physical maturity . Second , qadis should not assume that husbands and wives did not have ulterior legal motives , especially if they tried to invalidate a marriage that was already several years old . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's allegation that his wife had been a minor just because he wanted to divorce her without paying the outstanding mahr ; or a wife 's allegation that she had been a minor and could thus divorce her husband upon coming of age , just because she disliked the husband and wanted to separate from him. 69 <p> Registrar Rustomali reported back in early September . The 1903 case referred to by Qadi Muhammad had not been a case of child marriage , he reported , but a suit in which the husband had been accused of not paying the dafa , or wedding expenses . The outcome had been that his predecessor had " ordered the husband to pay to the girl $15 on account of her dowry and to provide her with a house according to Sharia. " 70 However , Qadi ' Umar had erred in the case of Zamla , he noted , for under Shaffi law , a minor could only be married by her father or grandfather . The marriage was for that reason invalid . His proposed solution was that " the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the marriage and break off the matrimonial tie . " 71 <p> For Qadi ' Umar , however , this was not the end of the story . On November 11 , Captain O'Brien noted that the qadi of Sheikh Othman had " displayed great slackness in not finding out the girl 's age for certain and that the marriage of the girl through her uncle was inconsistent with Mahomedan law . " This was the second irregularity , the Captain noted . He should be careful or he would be removed . The qadi received a letter to this effect on November 23 . <p> Zamla 's case throws some light on how young women such as Zamla found themselves married . First of all , whether she was a minor or not , both she and the groom were very young . Her husband , Abd al-Ghaffur , narrated how a Hajja Safiya , an informal marriage broker , it appears , had persuaded her father that his two sons were old enough to marry and that two suitable girls had recently arrived from Jabal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual to learn , " the young husband reported , " my father told me not to go ... " He was taken instead to Shaikh Othman and married to Zamla , in her absence . The girl was contracted into marriage by her uncles and her brother , he reported . The mahr had been set at Rs. 30 . The dafa of Rs. 40 for the bride 's wedding expenses was paid to Zamla 's uncle but ended up in the hands of her brother , who failed to buy any wedding clothes or other necessities for the bride . Finally , no one had chased her away , he claimed . She had left them of her own account , without informing them. 72 <p> Zamla narrated how she had not consented to the marriage and had personally informed Qadi ' Umar of this in the days leading up to it . However , he had just told her to go away . She had lived in her husband 's father 's house for two years and had been chased away by his mother . <p> The records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's minority concealed another agenda , may not have been far from the truth . In October 1906 , Zamla " had filed a suit in forma pauperis against her husband ... on the ground that the marriage was performed contrary to law . " Four days later , after ' Abd al-Ghaffur ( citing the opinion of the qadi of Aden ) admitted to this and agreed to pay the costs of the suit , dissolution was granted . Whether the claim that Zamla had been a minor gave Zamla her freedom or allowed ' Abd al-Ghaffur 's family to avoid paying the full ( outstanding ) mahr ( or a little bit of both ) can not be known with certainty . <p> The Dispute about Safiya bint Husayn : <p> Another Accusation against Qadi ' Umar of Sheikh Othman <p> On 1 March 1907 Qadi Muhammad wrote another letter to the Assistant Resident accusing Qadi ' Umar once again of contracting into marriage a minor , called Safiya Hussein . On February 21 , her mother , brother , and other witnesses including her uncle had taken her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad , finding that she was very young , refused to perform the marriage , even though she already had been married - from 7 September 1905 to 11 January 1906 - and divorced . The first marriage , in which her father had acted as her guardian , had been performed by the qadi of Sheikh Othman . The men then sent mother and daughter home and went to Qadi ' Umar of Sheikh Othman , who conducted the marriage ceremony at 11 PM. the same day . When he heard that the qadi of Aden had lodged a complaint with the Assistant Resident , Qadi ' Umar had immediately tried to remedy his mistake and had fetched the girl and transported her by boat to house of the groom 's grandfather . <p> Since Safiya 's father had died , Qadi Muhammad argued , and the law did not permit the marriage of a minor whose father was deceased , Safiya could not marry until she would come of age . Qadi " Umar should not only have made proper inquiries and called upon the girl to ascertain her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected the fact that all the men in the marriage party lived in Aden and Tawahi , which for the last thirty years had come under the qadi of Aden . <p> The qadi had two requests from the Assistant Resident : to separate the couple because the marriage was legally null and void , and to take measures against these " unlawful marriages that might corrupt the religion : " " If it had been God 's will that her husband , while she was in his house , had had intercourse with her , at this age , then the situation would have become very difficult indeed . " 73 <p> Qadi " Umar admitted that the girl had turned out be a minor , but insisted that he had followed correct procedure . He had depended on sound witnesses , he contended , and when his brother informed him that the girl was a minor , he had taken immediate action and separated the couple . When Safiya comes of age , he added , she is at liberty to marry whomever she likes . <p> Sayyid Rustomali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hospital assistant , who put her age at 13 . The girl could therefore indeed not marry without the consent of her guardian . " According to Shafai doctrine , " he noted to the Resident , " the marriage of a minor female can be contracted only by a father or a paternal grandfather , " and Safiya 's marriage is therefore invalid . Qadi ' Umar was again reprimanded . " The Kadi has erred , " the registrar concluded , in simply taking the witnesses on their word when they claimed Safiya was of age , " knowing full well that these ignorant and illiterate Arabs have no idea about it . He has failed to do his duty . " 74 <p> In Safiya 's case , it is striking that a girl whose age was estimated at only 13 years had already been married twice . For this second marriage , her mahr had been set at Rs. 20 plus a chador . The fairly high daf'a of Rs. 120 had been paid to her maternal uncle and brother , who had received Rs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of this money had indeed been used for silk clothing for the bride and other wedding expenses . <p> Although Qadi Muhammad claimed that neither husband had consummated his marriage with Safiya , Qadi " Umar 's reference that Safiya " had been treated by her relatives until she was alright , " suggests otherwise. 75 <p> The Case of Khadija Diriya : Counter-Accusations Against the Qadi of Aden <p> In March 1907 , Qadi ' Umar wrote a letter to Captain Hancock to justify his actions and to present counter-accusations against the qadi of Aden . He raised five cases of child marriages performed by the qadi of Aden between 1903 and 1907 , in two of which , he argued , those of Sa'ada and Asiya , the girls had lost their virginity and had been hurt . ( It is unclear whether these two experiences were one and the same thing or not ) . <p> After investigation , the Registrar reported that four of the five cases raised by Qadi ' Umar appeared to be groundless . The fifth case , however , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of child marriage and had already been tried . In 1903 , he reported , the qadi of Aden had been led to believe that the girl was of age and had performed her marriage to the man for whom she worked , when she was in reality only ten or eleven years old . The marriage had been consummated , so that the husband had been convicted of rape and sentenced to three years ' imprisonment , while the witnesses , including two women and a man , had been convicted of abetting the rape and sentenced to two years ' imprisonment. 76 <p> Clearly the qadi of Aden must be given a warning about Khadija 's case , the registrar noted in June 1907. 77 However , he was still much more critical of Qadi ' Umar : " I am of the opinion that the Kazi of Sheikh Othman is a somewhat mischievous person and had better be removed . " 78 However , by July , the registrar 's mood was milder . The people of Sheikh Othman were not dissatisfied with the qadi , the registrar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of Islamic law . He was especially popular with the people of the old village. 79 There was , moreover , no obvious replacement for him , he added , with the exception of the brother of the qadi of Aden . The latter , however , was not a proper candidate , " as it is common knowledge that the Kazi of Aden has been scheming for some time to oust Sheikh Omer Abdulla. " 80 The registrar reminded his superiors that the qadis should not be allowed to act autonomously and should be " really treated as part of the establishment of the Court of the Resident . " 81 <p> In a letter to Captain Hancock , the qadi of Sheikh Othman laid out the reasons for his colleague 's hostility. 82 The brother of the qadi of Aden , Sayyid Hammud , had once unsuccessfully applied for his position , he explained . Throughout his own six-year tenure as qadi of Sheikh Othman , Sheikh " Umar argued , and with every new political officer , Sayyid Muhammad and Sayyid Hammud had made trouble for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired and replaced with Sheikh Hammud . The government should look into the irregularities in the office of the qadi of Aden , Qadi ' Umar argued . First of all , Sheikh Hammud was performing marriage contracts for Qadi Muhammad and wrote all the letters for him , even though Captain Hancock had forbidden this . Second , Hammud had influenced the witnesses in Khadija 's case , persuading them not to implicate the qadi by saying that he had never seen the girl . Third , Qadi Muhammad had performed several child marriages himself , including that of Asiya , who had been so seriously hurt as a result of her defloration that six dayas ( midwives ) , five Arab and one Somali , had not been able to cure her . Fourth , since , as a schoolmaster , Hammud was a government official , the government could easily prevent him from interfering in matters that were not his business . At the end of June , Qadi ' Umar received " a final warning , " but was not removed. 83 <p> In his investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data on five girls , only two of whom had caused dispute , namely Khadija , discussed above , and Asiya , to be discussed below . Of the three others , ' A'isha probably had been a minor when she had been first married . She had been divorced in 1904 , allegedly without having lost her virginity . She had remarried in 1905 and was pregnant in 1907 . No one was interested in pursuing a legal suit and the matter was dropped . This was the same for Nima , who , moreover , was said to have had her menses at the time of her marriage . <p> The third girl , Sa'ada , belonged to the so-called low caste of Khadam ( or sweeper ) , as was reflected in her rather low mahr of Rs. 10 and daf a of Rs. 33 . She turned out to be about twenty years old in 1907 , so child marriage was not an issue . However , her case threw some negative light on the qadi of Aden in another way , as he had not acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ahmed in front of the qadi and claimed to have accepted marriage only later in the day , after the qadi had yelled at her , accused her of sowing discord ( fund ) among men , and encouraged her uncle to grab her by the hair and take her home. 84 In 1907 Sa'ada was not living with her husband , as the husband still had to pay the balance of the daf ' a and perform a particular ceremony. 85 <p> Khadija 's case illustrates the vulnerability of young domestic servants ( ayas ) , a common occupation for girls and women of poor families . It is obvious that since the time of her marriage , in 1903 , the qadis had come under increasing pressure to establish the age of the bride themselves and not to rely on the girl 's relatives as witnesses . Already , consummation with a child bride had been legally defined as rape , with the husband as rapist and the witnesses to the marriage as " abetters of rape . " <p> The Case of Asiya Muhammad : The Outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records of the cases presented above . The outrage of the qadis at each other , that of the registrar of the Resident 's Court ( and his superiors ) at the qadis , that of husbands at their wives , and wives at their husbands , and so forth . However , only in the case of Asiya Muhammad is the outrage focused on the fate of the child bride . Although the qadi of Sheikh Othman had first raised the issue of Asiya 's child marriage in March 1907 , it was Dr. John C. Young , a government medical doctor in Sheikh Othman , who refused to let the case go away , involving both qadis , writing repeatedly to the Assistant Resident , and examining the girl herself twice . <p> In July and August 1907 , Dr. Young wrote several letters to Captain Hancock about the physical injuries Asiya sustained as a result of intercourse with her husband . In Young 's expert opinion , Asiya had , by her own admission and his examination of her breasts and uterus , not yet menstruated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , Young explained : Both the vagina and sphincter ani had been ruptured and there was a fistulous opening between them . He also suspected that she had been sodomized . He had sent her to the qadi of Aden to look for redress . <p> Qadi ' Umar was eager to explain the damage that the qadi of Aden had made possible . He had interviewed Asiya personally . Asiya reported that she had been forced to marry an old man by her cousin , when she was still a minor and only 12 years old . That she had rejected his advances to sleep with her until , one day , while she was asleep , he had tied her up and raped her , causing her great injury . In the fourteen months that she had been injured , Qadi ' Umar explained , six midwives ( listed by name ) had been unable to heal her . Her husband had also beaten and insulted her and had kept her confined to the house , until she ran away and was taken to Dr. Young. 87 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First he explained why his actions had been lawful . He had married Asiya to Abibakr bin Ahmed , now 80 years old , on June 6 , 1905 , in front of witnesses who had testified affirmatively about her " cognition , age , and puberty . " 88 She had moreover looked about 17 years old , and both her husband and a midwife who knew Asiya confirmed that she had her menses when she moved into her marital home . He then explained the legal criteria for coming of age for both boys and girls : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Asiya was adult , he argued , by reason of ( 3 ) . The marriage was therefore valid and could not be canceled . <p> The qadi next pointed out that the problem with Asiya and Abibakr 's two-year-old marriage was not Asiya 's minority but other issues . The only time he had seen Asiya after her marriage , the qadi mentioned , was in July 1907 . Then first Asiya 's agent and then she herself had come to his office to ask him to summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her away . How could common sense accept her claim to have been a minor after such a long period of time had elapsed since her marriage ? If her claim were to be accepted , he warned , then all women who had lived with their husbands for a while , and had come to dislike them or were misled by others would use such " vicious tricks " to get a divorce . This would lead to great disturbance. 91 <p> Finally , the qadi brought medical evidence to bear on the case . The husband , who was 80 years old , testified that he was incapable of taking her virginity all at once and of doing such horrible things to her . This was attested to by the civil surgeon of Aden . Asiya had not mentioned to him , he wrote , the injuries Dr. Young had raised. 92 <p> Nevertheless the qadi had taken immediate action and , at the end of August , Asiya was staying at the qadi 's house until the government could decide on her fate. 93 <p> The British Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aden for relying " upon entirely inadequate evidence , " and failing to see the girl or even her brother in person . However , they did not decide to act on the complaint that Asiya was a minor , perhaps because no one had brought the case to Court . Writes one : " The girl 's fate is a horrible one and though no offense against her under Sections 375 rape or 377 unnatural offense of the I.P. Indian Penal Code can apparently be proven , I would willingly see her released from her old monster of a husband if possible . " 94 <p> Nevertheless , the qadi had no right to keep Asiya in his protection , the official noted : " the girl has her remedy in the Resident 's court . And it is there that she should seek it if she wishes to . Meanwhile it is open to her husband to sue the Court for the enforcement of his marital rights . " 95 <p> When Dr. Young heard from Asiya that she had been ordered to leave the qadi 's house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outraged : Why was this decision reached after such a vexatious delay ? The girl , upon a second examination , seemed very close to puberty . Were perhaps the husband 's friends playing for time ? " Meanwhile , what is the girl to do , " Young pleaded : " She has no friends . Must she be condemned to a life of shame or return to her brutal husband ? " 96 Captain Hancock 's response remained the same : the girl should apply to the Court. 97 <p> In the end it was Zamla 's husband who filed a suit for restitution of his conjugal rights . Asiya failed to show up at their first court appointment , but did appear on October 23 . She agreed to return to live with her husband and thus Major Carter considered the matter settled . On the next day , however , the husband returned to court , saying that Asiya had changed her mind and refused to return to him . On November 4 , they appeared in court again . Asiya expressed her readiness to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time she had been away from him . " When he refused on the grounds " that she had no right to obtain this as she left him of her own accord , " Asiya reportedly accepted to return without condition , and the " decision of 30 September was accordingly made absolute . " 98 <p> There is no doubt that the wisest comment upon this case came from the anonymous British official who observed : " I am by no means sure that we have ever got half the truth of the case . " 99 However , one must assume that the alternatives available to this young , poor , and seriously ill girl may have been very limited indeed . <p> The Case of Amina and Sikandar : <p> The Qadi of Aden Embarasses the British government <p> On the 28th of August Sayyid Muhammad Hassan , qadi of Aden , caused a row by refusing to perform a marriage at the house of Muhammad Ibrahim , overseer in the Military Works Department . He refused to accept the testimony of witnesses , announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the girl " was of tender age . " The boy 's father had become furious . Exclaiming , " Rahimcheet , a thousand rupees has been wasted only to take away my good name , " he had allegedly assaulted the qadi , who filed a complaint . In his complaint to the government , the qadi requested the Court to separate the couple until the girl 's age had been certified , as there were no lawful guardians to validate the marriage , and threatened to sue Sikander for rape. 100 <p> Major Carter was upset at the qadi 's refusal to go ahead with the marriage in such a respectable family . His refusal to accept the testimony of the family 's womenfolk that the girl was of age was highly unusual , as this was " the course legally adopted in the case of respectable families , such as in this case , where the accused is a responsible officer in the Military Works Department . " Even the qadi himself , he reported , admitted that " I have never insisted on seeing the bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have celebrated . " 101 <p> On September 1 , the Assistant Resident involved himself , composing a short internal memo on the legal aspects of marriage . He emphasized , among other things that : ( a ) a woman can contract herself in marriage if she has attained the age of puberty ; ( b ) that " a father , grandfather , or , failing a paternal guardian , the maternal kindred may dispose of an infant in marriage " ; and ( c ) that " Marriage among Mahomedans is not a sacrament , but purely a civil contract . " It was not important whether Amina was a minor , he argued , but whether she was contracted into marriage by a party competent to do so . If she was not , even then , " people are at perfect liberty to actually co-habit , if they choose , without being legally married . And an ordinary provision of Mahomedan law is , " he added , that , " in the case of proved continuous cohabitation , marriage will be presumed without the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistant Resident clearly could not bear the thought of offending such an upstanding citizen as Sikander 's father and was willing to try to bend the law to avoid doing so . Giving a clear example of class justice , he concluded , " I can not order separation . " 103 Instead , a more convenient course of action was followed and later that month a hospital nurse attested that Amina was 14 and Sikander 16 years old . <p> The Assistant Resident was well aware of why the qadi of Aden went to such an extraordinary extent to avoid performing a child marriage , as the incident at Siraj " Ali 's residence coincided with the case of Safiya , and the qadi had just recently been confronted with the outrage of Dr. Young . Yet he was furious : " The case only affords one more illustration of the defects of present arrangements and of the general incompetence of the present Kazis of Aden , " he grumbled , and ordered that the qadi be warned that his complaint was false and frivolous : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aden made two points very clear . First , that it was almost impossible to establish the age of a bride under the current circumstances ; and second , that the government 's orders to the qadis were contradictory : they were told to investigate carefully or even to insist on seeing the bride on one occasion , and reprimanded for doing do on another . The Vantage Point of the Early 1950s <p> The archival record stops here . However , a number of the issues raised in the disputes described above are exactly the same as those on which J.N.D. Anderson reported during his fieldwork in Aden in the early 1950s . As for the authority of the qadi at the time of Anderson 's visit , the Qadi Ordinance of 1943 explicitly stated that " the so-called Qadi is no more than a ma'dhun or registrar of marriages , " with no judicial powers whatsoever. 105 <p> With regard to child marriage , Anderson reported that the Indian Penal Code , Section 375 , which " includes in its definition of rape the act of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches the age of thirteen , " had been replaced by The Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance of 1939 . This law , he argued : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The Court even had acquired the right to act proactively , if it believed that a child marriage was about to take place , with heavy penalties to those who ignored its injunction . This was different from the situation in 1907 , it appears , as then husband and witnesses could only be tried after a child marriage had been consummated . Moreover , the Ordinance of 1939 clearly also applied to qadis who contracted minor girls into marriage , even though the loophole of " we were not aware " continued to be open to them . Finally the Ordinance raised the legal age for marriage to 18 for the groom and 14 for the bride . These provisions were certainly not in line with the Islamic law practiced in the colony in 1907. 107 <p> With regard to the issue of the bride 's consent , in 1907 the adult 's woman 's right to contract herself into marriage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not always actually respected . In the early 1950s this trend had been reinforced . The Court was even prepared to dissolve marriages in which a father had married off an adult but virgin daughter against her will , Anderson contended . In doing so , it used various rationales , from the modern jurist 's view that such compulsion was " foreign to Islam " to accepting evidence of hostility between father and daughter as an invalidating factor . " It seems probable , " Anderson concluded , " that the compulsory marriage of an adult woman would now always be held voidable by the Aden courts , even if the parties were Shafris. " 108 <p> As for jabr , the father or paternal grandfather 's right to marry off a minor girl , in the 1950s , Anderson states , " the court would no doubt endeavour to regard the marriage by compulsion of a young daughter to a decrepit or blind old man as itself evidence of such hostility , but might not , in the event , feel free to do so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British official connected to the Resident 's Court tried to present variant readings on who could contract a minor girl into marriage , the first trying to justify his negligence in investigating the child bride 's age properly and the second trying to justify a child marriage in a respectable family . Here the situation in the early 1950s does not appear to have changed and Shafi'i acceptance of the authority of father and paternal grandfather in this matter was upheld and not replaced with rulings from another school . For , although the Evidence Ordinance of 1939 affirmed that " all schools of law are regarded as equally authoritative , " the Court would normally consider " itself strictly bound by the rules of the school concerned , " that is to say that of the parties involved . Anderson 's casual addition that the " tendency ... to be influenced by British ideas of equity and justice , " " naturally continued " 110 becomes more meaningful against the background of the disputes examined here . For what was " natural " to Anderson was in reality the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As for cruelty ( as would have applied to Asiya in 1907 ) , it still had not become a legal ground for divorce . However , the court 's rejection of the husband 's petitions for the restitution of marital rights and enforcing his duty of maintenance - issues that both came up in Asiya 's case - had in the 1950s become a successful government strategy to pressure the husband into divorce. 111 <p> Finally , Anderson 's interviews in Aden brought to light a sentiment that is only hinted at in the records under examination , 112 namely the qadis ' strong sense that the British court favored wives at the expense of their husbands by making it possible for " disobedient " and " recalcitrant 113 women to manipulate the law at the expense of just and rightful husbands . Thus the qadi complained to Anderson that , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In the eyes of the qadi , wives ' ability to demand maintenance after moving out of the marital home , claiming that they were entitled to their own home under Islamic law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing was not affordable for large numbers of people . That individuals - men , but also women - were indeed using the courts not only to get justice but also to get specific financial and other benefits , is also evident from the cases discussed above . Conclusion <p> This small ethnography of the community actively associated with the administration of Islamic law in the Aden archives has yielded a number of insights about both that community and the law that it shaped ( and by which it was shaped ) . First of all , it appears that , for the lower classes , financial pressure was extreme . In this context , marriage , or men 's access to the company and services of women , was one occasion on which men could be made to pay substantial amounts of money , mostly ( but not exclusively ) to other men . <p> Child marriage occurred in Aden and was not uncommon . Girls , especially poor girls , were especially vulnerable to the exploitation of relatives , and it appears that brothers , uncles , even mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own wishes . Thus Khadija , the young servant girl , was maneuvered into a marriage with her employer ( who was punished for consummating it ) . <p> But women were not only victims . They also manipulated the rights entailed in marriage and divorce for their own benefit , e.g. , to get money out of old or new husbands . They appear not to have hesitated to use the courts , even though they may often have been pushed to do so by relatives . The case of Asiya and her ( perhaps ) octogenarian husband was probably settled out of court and it is likely that either extreme financial need or emoluments offered to her or her relatives caused her to acquiesce in the marriage . Zamla 's case was also probably settled out of court and she may have received her freedom in return for giving up on the full amount of her lawful mahr . <p> Qadis were not very patient with girls of whatever age who did not want to get married , as is evident from Sa'ada 's case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . <p> Young couples often lived with the groom 's parents , indicating the lack of housing for the urban poor . In one case we saw the British Court sentencing a man to a maintenance payment and the housing to which a wife was entitled under Islamic law. 115 From hindsight , this proved to be the beginning of a trend that gave wives considerable power to use the lack of adequate housing to either bring about the dissolution of a marriage or make a husband provide more resources . <p> This essay is also a case study in colonial Shari ' a and has brought into clearer focus the relationship between the qadis and the British Court . By 1907 British legal authority had become so strong that the qadis chose to discredit each other by using an issue that was primarily of interest to the British , that of child marriage . In this instance at least - and this may not be representative of their overall collaboration - the qadis did not unite to defend their authority and dignity against colonial interference , but went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this time , the Court had not only clearly established its authority over the qadis and Islamic law but had also monopolized the enforcement of the law . Thus even poor Muslim individuals , including women and girls , filed suit at the British Court to obtain their rights ( or just to get their way ) . Only in the British Court did a claim become a formal suit . Although many individuals still had their disputes settled by the qadis and resorted to the British Court after having consulted the qadi , for them - rich and poor - the British Court had nevertheless opened up a new legal venue and set of options . <p> The qadis , meanwhile , sandwiched between the British colonial administration and the community of Muslim subjects they were paid to serve , saw their freedom of action continuously shrink . Their very position and livelihood depended on a British Court that restricted their powers , set new legal standards , put them under continuous surveillance , and threatened to remove them if they failed to comply . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims for whose " comfort " their position had been created but whose rights could only be enforced through the British Court . By encouraging the individual legal initiatives of this Muslim community at the British Court - at least on issues considered relevant to them - the British used the common people as further leverage to force the qadis to bring their understanding of Islamic law into conformance with British social and legal agendas and expectations . <p> This is at least partly how colonial rule shaped the ways in which Islamic law was conceptualized and applied in the British colony of Aden . The locus of change was the British Resident 's Court , where the legal strategies of all constituencies were tested and judged , and succeeded or failed . As was the case with India 's Mohammedan Law , the Islamic law that was applied in Aden by the officials associated with the British Court , including the government qadis , was a new , hybrid , colonial Islamic law. 116 While it can be profitably compared to the authoritative texts of the Shafi'i madhhab , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , the Islamic law that is of greatest interest to the social historian and ethnographer is always shaped by the social contexts and people it is meant to shape . <p> * This paper was first presented at the Conference on Islamic Law and Anthropology at the International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World , Leiden , March 14-16 , 2003 . It is a byproduct of archival work on Somalis in Aden and is offered as a small contribution to the wider literature on Aden and colonial Shari'a . The title was inspired by Sally Merry 's " Ethnography in the Archives , " a paper presented to the Meeting of the Law and Society Association , June 1998 .
