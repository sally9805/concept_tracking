ED ABBEY SAID THE SONORAN DOSE Et A GOLDEN GLOW ON THE MIND , " WHICH IS ONE OF MANY GOOD REASONS WHY THIS CACTUS-SPIKED PARADISE SHOULD BE THE NEXT NATIONAL PARK . BY ANNETTE MCGIVNEY , SOUTHWEST EDITOR // I 'M USED TO SIGNING BACKCOUNTRY PERMITS that require me to camp 100 feet from the trail and appropriately deal with my own waste . And taking responsibility for my own safety when I travel amid certain dangers inherent to the natural world , such as bears and flash floods , is a routine part of my job . But getting blown up is a new one . Specifically , my chosen destination " contains the danger of property damage and permanent , painful , disabling , and disfiguring injury or death due to high-explosive detonations from falling objects such as aircraft , aerial targets , live ammunition , missiles , bombs , etc . " I look up at the person behind the counter , offer a teeth-clenching smile usually reserved for oral surgeons and IRS auditors , and then weigh the intimidating legalese against my desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadrant  --  3 million acres of federally owned desert wilderness . I read on : " There are also physical injury and health dangers from ground and aerial LASER ( Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation ) and other electromagnetic emissions . " A bead of sweat tries to make its way down my furrowed brow . With no paved roads , no natural springs , and not a single house or business , the empty quadrant has long been the domain of cacti and rattlesnakes . Anyone daft enough to worship the area 's relentless sun runs the risk of having her brain boiled in her skull . Back in the early 1940s , when a large chunk of this Sonoran Desert terrain was turned over to the U.S. Department of Defense ( DOD ) for use as a military training ground , the public could n't have cared less . But that was then . Now , there are legions of heat-wise desert rats like me who happily seek out and hiking locales . The late eco-philosopher , writer , and original desert rat Ed Abbey was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " The Great American Desert is an awful place , " he wrote in his book The Journey Home . " People get hurt , get sick , get lost out there . Even if you survive , which is not certain , you will have a miserable time . The desert is for movies and God-intoxicated mystics , not for family recreation . " Abbey 's motive was obvious : to protect his beloved " awful place , " one the largest chunks of roadless wilderness left in the Lower 48 . Now , in Arizona , a Tucson-based grassroots group is trying to carry out Cactus Ed 's wishes . The preservationists , including Clarke Abbey , Ed 's widow , as well as former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall , want to create a 3-million-acre Sonoran Desert national park and preserve . The park would combine most of the 1.8-million-acre Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range , the adjoining 860,000-acre Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge , and the 350,000-acre Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument into a single crown jewel managed by the National Park Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government agencies . So what 's standing in the way ? Off-road vehicle ( ORV ) enthusiasts are one roadblock . The desert lands around Tucson and Phoenix , Arizona , are bulldozed at the rate of 1 acre per hour to make room for urban sprawl , and the motor-minded recreationists who are losing more and more of their playground do n't want the wide-open empty quadrant put off-limits by park designation . And then there 's the U.S. Air Force , which likes to drop bombs on some of the land and does n't want to be bothered by sightseers . Set this wilderness island aside as a park , the military contends , and national security could be compromised . So I sign the permit-right below where it says I " agree to indemnify and hold harmless the United States Government .. from any claim of liability for injury , death , or property damage arising out of my visit " - and then head out to inspect the land . I 'd decided earlier that I wanted to see the place through the eyes of those most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broyles , who 's backpacked the empty quadrant for 30 years . He 's waiting for me outside the permit office at the Gila Bend Station on Luke Air Force Base ( AFB ) . As we walk to the car , I ask if he 's had any close calls with the local explosives . " Oh no , " he chuckles . " I 've had F-16 pilots lock onto my car for target practice , but they were just playing around . " After a 4-hour drive on a butt-numbing road , we reach the starting point for our Cabeza Prieta hike . Broyles , beaming with excitement since we left the highway , is eager to share his favorite place with me . As coordinator of the Sonoran Desert National Park Project , Broyles , 53 and a retired high-school history teacher , now spends most of his waking hours preaching the gospel of preservation . Unable to contain himself any longer , he puts his overhauled ' 74 Chevy Suburban in park and jumps out into the road dust . " You do n't just hike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range to the next . It 's like connecting the dots , " he says , gesturing to the vast ocean of space fuzzy with heat , where mountains rise like jagged teeth . Broyles , who 's been labeled " a desert rat prince , " has connected more of these dots than anyone . He 's tramped across just about all of the 19 mountain ranges , 13 valleys , and three dune fields contained within the proposed park 's boundaries . In the process , he 's become the recognized authority on the locations of life-saving tinajas ( potholes filled with rainwater ) and has helped to chart treks for many empty-quadrant pilgrims over the years , including Ed Abbey . " From here , you can hike all the way to the Gulf of California in 3 1/2 days , " Broyles says , gazing off to the southwest and reflecting on a previous trek along the ancient Native American " shell trail . " The route crosses glasslike lava fields beneath the blazing sun , and he had to carry all of his water . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basin , and Chihuahuan-the Sonoran is generally devoid of water and receives only a couple of inches of rain a year . But the Sonoran is more biologically diverse than those other and lands , with more than 2,000 species of plants and 550 species of vertebrates . It is rich with birdsong , spring blossoms , and mammals like bighorn sheep , mountain lions , and coyotes , and is far from the barren place often associated with a desert landscape . The ecological boundaries of the desert extend north into central Arizona , west into southern California , and south into Mexico , occupying much of the Mexican state of Sonora . But the heart of the Sonoran Desert is here in the empty quadrant , where the infinitely complex environmental master plan that enables so many organisms to exist on so little water is still humming along . And it never ceases to fascinate Broyles . As we hike into Tule Canyon , a stone 's throw from the Mexican border , he points out unusual plants and animal sign as nonchalantly as if he were naming products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree .... That 's a senita cactus .... These beans from the mesquite tree provided important nutrients to the nomadic desert people 1,000 years ago .... Look at the fruit on this salt bush .... There 's bighorn scat . " The pellets are about the size of grapes . I 'm amazed that an animal weighing upwards of 70 pounds excretes so little . " That 's one of the ways they conserve water , " Broyles explains . Modern man , on the other hand , is extremely ill-equipped for desert survival , losing water through every pore and orifice almost as quickly as it 's consumed . We 've hiked for barely a few hours , and I 've already downed 2 liters of water even though the temperature is mild , in the 80-degree range . And the weight of all the water I 'm carrying only exacerbates my thirst . As we cross a sparsely vegetated creosote flat , Broyles points out a faint depression in the desert pavement . " That 's a shell trail , a path used by ancient people going to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all over the place here . " I bend down to examine a pottery shard and take another swig of water from my unbreakable plastic bottle . Ancient travelers carried their water in ceramic pots , and dropping one was probably a death sentence . " This is a mystical place , all right , " muses Broyles , " but hiking here takes a certain mental toughness . I 've learned I can do things out here that I did n't know I was capable of . " I wonder how many of his former high-school history students know this side of " Mr. Broyles " -a man who 's survived hundreds of solo treks across this waterless void , who 's used the same external-frame backpack for nearly 3 decades , carrying his water in half-gallon bleach bottles and wearing white tennis shoes so he can see his feet when he hikes at night . As a full moon rises , we set up camp among a village of granite boulders . In the purple and pink of twilight , we eat dinner without speaking , not wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I almost spew pasta on Broyles as three F-16s rip through the sky . Broyles , who 's used to the sudden supersonic disturbances , does n't flinch . Biologists for the Goldwater say the wildlife , including the endangered Sonoran pronghorn , is used to the jets , too . The overwhelming silence returns as quickly as it vanished , and I ask Broyles about the military 's impact on the desert . " We understand the Goldwater is important to national security , " he says . " We do n't want to kick the military out . " Since the postVietnam era , most of the airspace over the Goldwater range and the Cabeza Prieta refuge has been used for military practice maneuvers . Just 6 percent of the 2.7 million acres is impacted at the ground level , and " the preserve part of our proposal , " Broyles says , " would allow the military to continue dropping bombs on that small percentage of land . The Park Service would manage the rest of it because they 're better equipped to deal with recreation impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates and the military agree on : The primary threat to far more than 6 percent of this land is slobbish civilians . Sensitive desert soils and vegetation are being crushed by ORV use , much of it illegal since 98 percent of the Cabeza Prieta is federally designated wilderness . Ancient Native American archaeological sites and historic graves have been vandalized . And high-impact car camping , which occurs anywhere and everywhere , is eating away at the largest remaining pristine chunk of Sonoran Desert . Since Cabeza Prieta and Goldwater officials started keeping track of visitation 8 years ago , the number of recreationists has more than doubled , from 2,277 visitor days ( one person camping for 1 night ) in 1992 to 5,286 visitor days in 1999 . Meanwhile , the Cabeza Prieta has only six field staff to monitor and patrol 860,000 acres with a paltry annual budget of $300,000 . Compare that to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument next door , which has a budget of $1.6 million , 350,000 acres , and extensive back  --  country restrictions that have lessened the impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it a crown jewel , " observes Broyles , " and people treat it special . " The next morning , I awake to a lush , rose-colored sky and Broyles beckoning me out of my tent . " Want to watch a poor man 's television ? " he asks . I join him at the edge of camp , where he 's gazing at the long eastern horizon illuminated by the rising sun . Mountain peaks that we saw last night are disappearing , as if rubbed out by a giant eraser . A big , blue lake appears at the foot of the distant monoliths , but it 's just a mirage . Every year , the bodies of Mexican nationals who tried to sneak across the desert in search of work in the United States are found out here . Their remains are picked clean by turkey vultures , and are a grim reminder of how unforgiving this land can be . " What is it that makes you want to hike here ? " I ask Broyles . It 's change , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite time : " When there 's too much rain , the desert responds immediately . When there 's too little rain , the desert responds just as quickly another way . I like change , and change is rapid in the desert . " SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER my hike with Broyles , I 'm back at the Gila Bend permit office . My " hold harmless " paperwork is valid for a year , but my hiking partners ( my husband , Mike , and Air Force fighter pilot Capt . Jim Greenwald and his wife , Paloma ) need to promise they wo n't sue Uncle Sam . We huddle over topos spread across the hood of my car . Greenwald , who 's researched our hiking route from the air " at 500 miles an hour , " got the maps from the range management office at Luke AFB in Phoenix , where he 's a flight instructor . Our plan is to enter Visitor Area B , one of four sections currently open to the public , and hike into Ryan Canyon on the eastern side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that Ryan Canyon contains " beautiful , pristine desert with an outstanding riparian area . " That 's the good news . The bad news is that it 's about 15 miles from Manned Range 3 , where inert bombs are dropped on targets , and 10 miles from East TAC , where live bombs are dropped on one very barren hill . " The road to Ryan Canyon is curved , " says Greenwald , pointing to the topo . " If we get onto anything straight , then we 're on the nuke runs . That 's where they used to train to drop nuclear weapons . " Thankfully , nothing atomic is going on these days . An avid outdoorsman and patriot , Greenwald had contacted BACKPACKER because he was peeved about a comment from an environmentalist in the October 1999 Signpost " Putting the Defense Department in charge of land management in the Goldwater-Sonoran-Cabeza Prieta area is like asking a plumber to fly a 747 . " Greenwald said of the DOD , " While our core mission may not be land management , we regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the DOD is willing to commit large resources to preserving these lands . Many public lands are trashed , but the range is different . I 'll show you vast areas with no impacts . " So I took him up on his offer and here we are , going through a locked gate , past " Danger ! " signs adorned with skulls and crossbones , onto a dirt track that the map shows leading to Ryan Canyon . It does n't take long before we realize the Air Force topo is all wrong . The first road dead-ends , and the second , straight-asan-arrow route brings an F-16 screaming just above our heads : A nuke run . As three more jets zip by , I can see clouds of dust a half mile away , where pilots are dropping their inert payloads . The " hold harmless " agreement does n't seem so absurd anymore . Greenwald jumps out of his Jeep , visibly frustrated . " Let 's just blow off Ryan Canyon , " he huffs , eager to get out of the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe hike to Ryan Canyon tomorrow . " After all , this is supposed to be an easy hike . That 's why Jim and Paloma brought their dog , Duke , and Mike and I , our 3-year-old son , Austin . At 5 P.M. , the whistle blows and the skies fall silent . It 's Friday , and when Greenwald says " we do n't work on the weekends , " I 'm relieved . Even though we 're now well inside Visitor Area B , the thought of armed F-16s-often flown by students under the supervision of instructors like Greenwald-rattles my nerves . On weekdays , the Goldwater has the busiest skies of any military training range in the country , with about 70,000 sorties flown each year . " Our flight scheduling is very.tight day in and day out , " says Greenwald . " But when our range management folks tell us pronghorn have been spotted in one of the target areas , we cancel our flight plans for that day . " On the endangered species list since 1967 , the Sonoran pronghorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals that can run up to 60 mph , faster than any other species in the Western Hemisphere . Currently , there are only 130 left in the United States . Although the military maintains that the decline of the pronghorn is n't linked to the F-16 traffic , the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife is suing the Air Force for failure to comply with the Endangered Species Act . As we camp beneath the shadow of Hat Mountain , one of the most familiar navigational landmarks for Luke AFB pilots , I ask Greenwald if our nation 's recent extended period of peace has reduced the military 's need for the Goldwater . " Oh no ! " he says emphatically . " This period of peacetime has increased our need for the Goldwater . The military has been able to concentrate on improving technology , and now we have weapons that can travel 30 miles or more . We need a lot of real estate to train with these weapons . " In October 1999 , Congress extended the DOD 's lease of the Goldwater for another 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 , and Sonoran national park proponents were hoping that would provide an opportunity to return much of the Goldwater range to civilian use and management . Instead , all of the range ( with the exception of the Cabeza Prieta ) will be managed by the military-the eastern half by the Air Force and the western half by the U.S. Marines . Every 5 years , the DOD must submit an environmental report card to Congress , explaining how the military is protecting the natural and cultural resources . " That renewal agreement was the product of behindthe-scenes politics . It was passed quickly and did n't go through the public review process , " Broyles had told me earlier . " Already , 75 percent of the Goldwater is open to the public . Does the military really want to be distracted with managing visitation on all that land ? Turning most of the range over to the Park Service would relieve them of that responsibility . " The next morning , our entourage heads out around the base of Hat Mountain . The desert is much greener here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 50 miles to the south . The sloping bajadas are studded with forests of towering saguaro cacti , and the washes are lined with palo verde and mesquite trees . Aside from the spiderweb of car tracks around our Hat Mountain campsite , this desert is pristine . It 's as peaceful and quiet as any wilderness I 've visited . " You 'd never know we were near two target areas , " muses Greenwald . " They 're just over that ridge , 5 to 10 miles away . " As the morning heats up and our packs seem to grow heavier from the water we 're carrying , we decide to give up on Ryan Canyon . We spend the rest of the weekend camped next to a wash in the shade of large palo verde trees and , when the sun is lower , a jagged mountain ridge . While everyone else lounges in the afternoon shade , I follow Greenwald on a scramble up a scree-riddled ridge . He wants to get up high and look down on this landscape , like he does when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaintop , he scans the sea of volcanic landmarks , trying to find something he recognizes . " It all looks so different down here , " he says . " I ca n't imagine what it would be like to parachute into this place . I always think about that when I 'm hiking somewhere new . " On further rambles and during the hike back to our cars , we find the desert backcountry virtually untouched , just as it must have been hundreds of years ago . The only signs of humanity are two World War II-era artifacts : a 50-mm shell dropped from a plane and an unexploded 70-mm artillery shell left by a tank . " It 's strange that we 're hiking in one of the most heavily used military ranges in the country , and we 're seeing so little evidence of military use , " Greenwald notes , eager to highlight the Air Force 's preservation of the area . As far as the military brass is concerned , preserving the area 's wilderness qualities is n't a point of contention . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to a recent Environmental Impact Statement , 73 percent of the Goldwater range ( 1.8 million acres ) " may receive unplanned or unintended ordnance impacts . " Right now , the " hold harmless " permits and lots of " Danger ! " signs are effective deterrents , but make the area a national park and visitation will increase , as will the potential for an accident that could lead to restrictions on military activities . While Air Force higher-ups wo n't say it for the record , Greenwald will admit this much : " The park-preserve proposal would probably complicate our training . You can bet that if lots of people start hiking in the Cabeza , we 're going to get more noise complaints , even though we wo n't be doing anything different than we are now . We 'll have to change our flight patterns as a result . That 's what 's happening as more homes are being built near Luke AFB in Phoenix . " Considering how fast nearby Phoenix and Tucson are growing , the obvious question is , Will more visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park ? And beyond that , using our abandoned foray to Ryan Canyon as an example , what will happen if the curiosity-seekers do n't have proper maps to follow or contact a land manager ahead of time ? In other words , is visitation inevitable , and is the best way to prevent accidents through the granting of park status ? As Mike and I load our packs into our car and bid the Greenwalds goodbye , I notice a Mexican national darting through a thicket of creosote . He 's wearing flip-flops and carrying a plastic jug . As soon as he sees me , he runs straight into Manned Range 2 . ' I 'M CAMPED IN ORGAN PIPE CACTUS NATIONAL Monument , my only companions being a Gila monster and Ed Abbey . I brought along a book of his essays and like to think he 's here in spirit . From my seat on a ridge high above my tent , I can see 100 miles or more , past the saguaros on the plains of Organ Pipe and into the empty quadrant , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before touching the ground , hangs from the sky like wispy , gray angel hair , taunting the parched landscape below . Abbey is resting in peace somewhere out there , buried in an illegal grave to satisfy his dying wish . " He could have been buried anywhere , " Clarke had said . " There were so many places he had traveled . It shows how much he loved the place . " I wonder what he would have thought about the state of affairs today in the place he loved . Or maybe he knows , if his wish to come back in the next life as a turkey vulture came true . Back in the 1960s and ' 70s , when Ed hiked here , it appealed to him , says Clarke , because " it was the place where nobody else wanted to go . " The term " desert rat " had n't been coined yet , because there were n't that many . There was no need to drive all the way to the Cabeza Prieta to go ORVing because there was wide-open desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucson . Now , the family and friends of Abbey , who had been a vocal critic of the Park Service , are fighting to save his favorite place by turning it over to that very agency . " We 've been led to this because of the ORVs , " says Clarke . " Sure , bringing in the Park Service is the lesser of two evils , but it 's what 's best for the land . " The third leg of the stool that would comprise the Sonoran Desert national park and preserve , Organ Pipe , has been under Park Service management since the monument was created in 1937 . And it shows . There are no ORV tracks or illegal fire rings scarring the desert . There are backcountry camping regulations that probably would be extended throughout the Cabeza and Goldwater in the proposed national park . For instance , backpackers in Organ Pipe must carry every drop of drinking water ; nothing can be taken from natural sources , not even from rain puddles . And backcountry camping is allowed only in certain zones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't able to hike where I had originally planned to in Organ Pipe because my destination was n't in the right zone . The good side of that is that off-roading would be illegal , there would be more money to enforce laws , and there would likely be regulations and signs designed to keep people from accidentally winding up in a bombing zone . The best hope for making the Sonoran Desert park and preserve a reality rests with Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) . In response to the Goldwater renewal agreement hastily passed in October 1999 , McCain introduced Senate Bill 1963 , which calls for a study of how the Goldwater range should be managed . One of the options cited is to turn it into a national park and preserve . If that bill is approved , the Department of the Interior will conduct another study and make a recommendation to Congress . In the final step , Congress would pass legislation authorizing creation of a new park . Broyles and his group think it could all happen within 5 years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have are show-stoppers , " he told me when I later tracked him down in Washington , DC , where the desert rat prince was lobbying for the park . " The holdup with this proposal is just a turf battle . Everybody 's got to look at the big picture . " And that 's easy to do when you 're sitting in Organ Pipe . What makes this land a national treasure is that it 's so big , so empty . Combine these 3 million acres with the adjoining Pinacate Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and you 've got more than 6 million acres of wilderness . The Sonoran Desert national park would n't offer much to windshield tourists because there 's no Yosemite Falls and no Grand Teton to gawk at-just space , unbroken , undeveloped , unlike anywhere else . So what if an occasional F-16 interrupts the silence ? You 'd have to get on a bush plane to find another U.S. backpacking destination as remote as this . After spending nearly 3 weeks hiking through the Cabeza Prieta , the Goldwater range , and Organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big empty . But I can see why Ed Abbey loved it , and why the people who loved him are fighting to make it a national park . From my ridgetop perch in the dim twilight , surrounded by the pungent scent of desert rain clouds , I read the end of Abbey 's essay " A Walk in the Desert Hills , " an account of a solo , 115-mile trek through the Cabeza Prieta and Goldwater in the 1960s : " The walk , the hills , the sky , the solitary pain and pleasure  --  they will grow larger , sweeter , lovelier in the days and years to come , like a treasure found and then , voluntarily , surrendered . Returned to the mountains with my blessing . It leaves a golden glowing on the mind . " Sidebar Sonoran Desert Sidebar The Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument combine for a total of more than 1.2 million acres of federally designated wilderness , all of it prime territory for remote backpacking . The Goldwater range offers to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation zones called " Visitor Areas . " Aside from a few dayhiking paths in Organ Pipe , there are no trails ; the open desert terrain makes crosscountry trekking fairly easy , though . The biggest limitation is the need to carry water . Access into the region is by only a handful of roads , and all-with the exception of AZ 85-are rugged dirt tracks . For a trip of 4 days or more in the Goldwater or Cabeza Prieta , plan a route that will take you by water you 'll have cached somewhere along the four-wheel  --  drive roads El Camino del Diablo or Christmas Pass . Organ Pipe has two graded dirt roads , Ajo Mountain Drive and Puerto Blanco Road , along which water can be cached . Unless you 're a diehard desert rat , you 'll likely find this remote , waterless region most enjoyable when bitten off in small chunks .
