<p> Tracey Casale likens the current Beacon of Hope Crisis Pregnancy Center to the small manger in which Jesus was born . <p> A miracle took place in that setting more than 2,000 years ago , Casale said , just as miracles are happening in the small house where desperate women come for hope and help . <p> " Operating out of 700 square feet with 300 volunteers and 1,000 clients a year is an interesting endeavor , " said the Beacon of Hope director . <p> Just the other day as Casale entered the house , she encountered " an infant carrier with a newborn on the floor , five people in a waiting room the size of a small bathroom , two people  --  one client and one counselor  --  in one counseling room , two in another and two others in the other offices . And we had a flood last week . I just laughed and said , ' It 's time , Lord . ' " Time for a new place , she meant . <p> Once construction is finished on a 13,000-square-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread out and bring all facets of the outreach under one roof . <p> While the first floor of a small house is the site where clients come for counseling , the hub of the center 's abstinence program is in a part-time worker 's basement . It 's a popular program that Casale said is growing and making a difference in north Fulton County . <p> In 1999 , Beacon representatives started teaching abstinence in sex education classes at Chattahoochee High School . Word of the program got out and , within two years , Casale said the center could n't keep up with the demand from the school system . <p> Currently part-time staffers are bringing the message to students at Centennial , Independence , Milton , Chattahoochee , Roswell as well as Northview and Alpharetta high schools . During presentations to private Christian schools , the Christian aspect of the message is stressed . <p> One of the four abstinence teachers lives in Newnan , and has brought the program to several schools in Fairburn . Beacon has partnered with Perimeter Church to create a parent component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empower parents to discuss a " naturally uncomfortable " subject with their children , said Casale . <p> In the new facility , basement space will be dedicated to a store with baby supplies and a community room where workshops and gatherings can be held . An exam room and a registered nurse will be available for ultrasounds and follow-up medical care for pregnant women . <p> " Once you have that life-affirming medical care on site , 79 to 90 percent of women who get a positive pregnancy diagnostic with support and care choose life , " said Casale . <p> Beacon 's current roommate is Summit Counseling , an outreach on the second floor of the house . Summit will move to the top floor of the new building , continuing a unique relationship between the two nonprofit organizations . <p> Both Beacon and Summit operate under the Mount Pisgah family of ministries , according to Summit director David Smith . Each ministry has a 501(c)3 , nonprofit status but maintains an affiliation with the Alpharetta church . <p> " I 've never seen another church that has anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor Allen Hunt . " This new home for the Summit and the Beacon is a real living testimony to our desire to serve the hopes and the hurts in this community . " <p> Former pastor Warren Lathem started the ministry 17 years ago . In the five years that Smith has been director of the center , the number of clients has more than doubled . <p> " In the first quarter of this year , we saw over 1,000 sessions . We 're on line to do 4,000 sessions this year , " said Smith . " When I got here they were doing less than 1,000 a year . " <p> Summit offers counseling to children , families and couples . A specialist in eating disorders is on staff , as well as someone who can diagnose attention deficit disorder and other learning disabilities . One counselor offers an in-depth process that helps students and their families determine possible careers and college choices . <p> Among the staff of eight very specialized counselors , Smith said " we 're all generalists enough to see clients initially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While the center works with Beacon clients , Smith said 90 percent of the folks who seek help at Summit are from the Alpharetta , Roswell and North Georgia communities , with 60 percent having no affiliation with Mount Pisgah . <p> Those statistics back up the center 's philosophy of not existing merely for the sake of church members . <p> " The thing with this is not to in-reach to care for our own folks , " stated Smith . " This is intentionally outreach to care for our community . I started work here the same month as Allen Hunt and he was very clear in saying we 're going to be a place of compassion . We 're going to support compassionate ministries .
