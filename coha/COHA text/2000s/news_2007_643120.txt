<p> In the second half of " Runnin ' Down a Dream , " a documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers by the director Peter Bogdanovich , Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam sits in on a duet of " The Waiting . " Standing before a tumultuous crowd roaring its approval , Mr. Petty turns to Mr. Vedder and suggests that he enjoy the moment . " Look at that , Eddie  --  rock and roll heaven . " <p> Moviegoers might be saying the same thing for months to come . There seems to be enough projects in theaters and in development built on the intersection between celluloid and what used to be called vinyl to fill a jukebox . <p> " Runnin ' Down a Dream " is one of three musically themed movies scheduled for the closing weekend of the New York Film Festival , along with " The Other Side of the Mirror , " a Bob Dylan documentary , and " Fados , " a look at the Portuguese musical tradition . <p> The music of the Beatles is currently reimagined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Control , " a dramatic feature about the Manchester sad-core band Joy Division , will have its theatrical release , to be followed next month by Todd Haynes 's " I 'm Not There , " featuring six performers all taking turns as avatars of Bob Dylan . <p> Meanwhile , Martin Scorsese , whose Rolling Stones documentary will come out next year , just signed on for a documentary about George Harrison . <p> And after a summer that saw musicals and biopics like " Hairspray , " " El Cantante " and " La Vie en Rose , " a modest movie called " Once , " starring the Frames front man Glen Hansard , continues to play in theaters , powered by ardent word of mouth . <p> Mr. Bogdanovich , who was invited to make a film about the 30-year career of a master of the three-minute pop song and responded with a nearly four-hour documentary , said that music in general and that of Mr. Petty is often a gateway to bigger themes . <p> " Tom Petty is a particularly American story , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been a very good indicator of where we are in the narrative of contemporary history . " <p> The Petty documentary will probably not have a big theatrical run  --  Best Buy will sell the DVD exclusively  --  but the film 's backer , Warner Brothers Records , hopes that all sorts of Petty fans will snap up a documentary about a man with 50 million in all-time sales . ( It 's also releasing a concert DVD of a 30th-anniversary show in Gainesville , Fla. , Mr. Petty 's hometown . ) <p> The movie looks back in cultural history to a time before " rock stars were invented on game shows , " as Mr. Petty wryly observes . It also serves as a vivid reminder that Mr. Petty remains one of the coolest guys out of the South since William Faulkner , a straight-ahead rocker who got the likes of Mr. Dylan , Johnny Cash , Roy Orbison and Mr. Harrison to play with him . <p> In the midst of movie clutter , familiar musical figures offer one way to catch audience attention . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Day " ( about Cole Porter ) and " The Gene Krupa Story , " and the link between musical and visual forms was cemented by MTV back when the network actually used to show music videos . Following a path taken by singers like Frank Sinatra , there is a host of musical stars today who have found traction as film actors , including Jennifer Hudson , Ice-T , Ludacris and Queen Latifah . <p> The music and film industries might be forming a more steadfast alliance partly to ward off disruptive technologies that allow people to partake without paying , but those same technologies are part of what makes music-oriented projects more likely to be undertaken and potentially more lucrative . Even beyond taking advantage of vastly improved theatrical sound systems , both in theaters and in the home , such films have become a rich source of DVDs , downloads and accompanying compilation and inspired-by albums , like Jay-Z 's take on Ridley Scott 's forthcoming " American Gangster . " ( Sometimes a musical companion can outlive and surpass the film itself , as arguably happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still passed around as mood music for an alternative universe . ) <p> " In a digital age , there is a crossover in delivery systems  --  iTunes and the Web , DVDs  --  that allows for both musical and film experience , " said Richard Pena , program director of the New York Film Festival . " The technological changes have had an effect on the films themselves as well . You have more and more complex soundtracks , to the point where soundtracks become almost as important as the image tracks from the filmmakers . In the truest sense , you get a kind of audio-visual spectacle . " <p> Beyond providing narrative assists and serving as a platform for huge crowd-pleasers like " Dreamgirls , " pop music is built on a vast series of rabid , self-defined tribes , who will scoop up any and all products about a given artist or group . That may explain why Joy Division , a group that put out just two records and was never a huge arena band , merits not just a feature , but also a documentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be playing a role . Many baby boomers whose seminal experiences were accompanied by a certain band or song are now in their prime moviemaking years . But hybrid celebrity culture is in there as well . <p> " The actors today are absolutely musically obsessed , " said the director James Toback , who is currently in the studio with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan , laying down tracks for his coming documentary on Mike Tyson . " When pop culture became the culture , stars of the two forms interacted and blended , inspiring desire for all sorts of crossover projects . " <p> Of course music wo n't redeem every project . " Ray " and " Walk the Line " notwithstanding , bald attempts to capitalize on embedded awareness can head into the tank faster than you can say " From Justin to Kelly . " <p> And then there 's " Walk Hard : The Dewey Cox Story , " the faux biopic starring John C. Reilly , coming in December from the comedy workshop of Judd Apatow . One of the surest signs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of parody , and " Walk Hard " riffs through many of the genre 's tendencies . After playing a few songs from the movie and showing a clip from the film last week in Los Angeles , Mr. Apatow said later by phone that he and Jake Kasdan , the film 's director , watched many of the classics and decided that the stories were all pretty much the same . <p> " A small-town person grows up amidst a tragedy in his family , becomes a star , cheats on his first wife , goes into rehab , falls in love , cheats on his second wife , then sobers up again , experiences a final triumph and passes away peacefully or dies horribly , " he said . <p> " We all know these stories from VH1 's ' Behind the Music , ' and even though we know what to expect , we still love watching them .
