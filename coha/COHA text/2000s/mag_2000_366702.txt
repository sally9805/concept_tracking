The outlook for bank stocks could n't be any uglier . We 're a lock for higher short-term interest rates when the Fed meets March 21 , and a rate boost or two after that seems likely before summer . Rising short-term rates squeeze bank profit margins and , more important , dampen loan demand . That 's why bank stocks have been crashing faster than your favorite ATM , shedding 40% of their value since interest rates started climbing rapidly more than a year ago . <P> Which is why you should start paying attention to this beleaguered industry . Because it 's not really all that beleaguered . Banks long ago learned how to hedge their interest-rate risk . So margins are n't shrinking all that much or all that fast , and loan demand remains strong , as do earnings . Fed chief Alan Greenspan cryptically alluded to budding credit problems last week when he cautioned that bad loans get made in good times . But it was just a reminder . There 's nothing pervasive out there like the speculative loans tied to real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees in the past . Not that today 's economy is without speculation . The Internet certainly fills that void . But banks are n't funding the speculation . The stock market is . <P> Yet bank stocks now trade below the panic levels reached during the Asia crisis in 1998 . Many sport price-to-earnings ratios below 7 , a low mark not widely seen in the bank sector since tough times in 1990 . Simply put : Bank stocks are discounting a severe recession when it 's not clear that we 'll get one at all . <P> Why ? It 's partly a knee-jerk reaction to higher rates . But equally important is the massive portfolio shift from old-economy stocks to new-economy stocks that I wrote about last week . Investors are dumping anything that has n't done well to chase high-flying tech stocks . Financial-services mutual funds are getting hit with redemptions ; fund managers are selling bank stocks to pay off departing shareholders . <P> Tremendous value is now being created outside of the tech arena  --  and banks may be the most compelling . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " quips Tom Johnson , CEO of mortgage lender Greenpoint Financial , whose stock has tumbled 60% and now carries its lowest PE ever , 7 . Johnson says the whole sector carries " disaster prices " with no disaster in sight . <P> So why should n't you empty the vault and buy ? You might be too early . Bank stocks will suffer until the first glimmer that the Fed plans to stop raising rates . That 's when you 'll want to load up . For me , part of the fun of investing is spotting great values in the making and getting ready to pounce at the right moment . Now is the time to do homework . When the bank stocks come back , they 'll come back fast . <P> The easy play will be a bank stock fund because the whole group will move . If you 're worried about missing it , start nibbling soon  --  but not before the next Fed hike . Stock pickers should look for banks and thrifts in growth regions like the South and West and with diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods , likes Washington Mutual and Fleet Boston . Scott Black , president of Delphi Management , likes North Fork and Peoples Heritage . Among larger banks , Chase and Bank of New York look attractive . But beware banks with operating difficulties , like First Union and Banc One . They wo n't rise with the tide . Bank on it .
