ABSTRACT . The study tested the validity of a new measure of dogmatism by examining university students ' evaluations of the Bible . Those who believed that every word in the Bible came directly from God and that the Bible is free of any error , contradiction , or inconsistency scored much higher on this dogmatism measure than students who thought otherwise . Such " true believers " then read the 4 highly varying Gospel accounts of the resurrection of Jesus . The most dogmatic of them still insisted there were no contradictions or inconsistencies in the Bible . The less dogmatic acknowledged that contradictions and inconsistencies exist . These results reinforce those of 4 earlier studies that indicated that the new measure of dogmatism has empirical validity . <p> Key words : Bible , Christian , contradictions , dogmatism , DOG Scale , Gospel <p> RESEARCHERS STUDYING DOGMATISM have , without question , used Rokeach 's ( 1960 ) pioneering D Scale more than any other in their work . Its popularity notwithstanding , the D Scale has been plagued since its inception by poor validity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogmatism , one can find very little evidence that it does ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 191-201 ) . Hoping to advance matters , I recently defined dogmatism as " relatively unchangeable , unjustified certainty " and developed a 20-item DOG Scale to measure it ( Altemeyer , pp. 201-205 ; see Appendix ) . This scale 's 10 protrait items express such sentiments as " The things I believe in are so completely true , I could never doubt them . " Its 10 contrait items say such things as " Flexibility is a real virtue in thinking , because you may well be wrong . " <p> The DOG Scale has been used mainly with Manitoba student samples and sometimes their parents . Its 190 interitem correlations average about .30 ( compared with .10 for the D Scale ) , yielding an alpha coefficient of about .90 . DOG scores correlate ( .50-.65 ) with the Right-Wing Authoritarianism ( RWA ) Scale  --  a measure of the rightist " authoritarian personality " that led Rokeach ( 1960 ) on his quest more than 50 years ago . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of DOG items than did their Democratic counterparts ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 287-289 ) . Although some dogmatism probably exists among the advocates of any cause  --  and indeed the items were written to apply equally to any belief system  --  the evidence to date indicates it is more often a right-wing than a left-wing mind-lock . <p> Four studies suggest the DOG Scale has empirical validity . In 1993 , I asked samples of students and parents to indicate , in 12 different ways , how zealous they were about their " most important outlook on life "  --  whatever it was . For example , to what extent did they " try to explain ( this ) outlook to others at every opportunity " ? The outlook could be anything ( e.g. , religion , socialism , capitalism , feminism , a scientific outlook , or a highly personal philosophy ) . I expected zealots to be relatively dogmatic , and summed zealot scores were correlated ( .43-.52 ) with DOG responses ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 209-213 ) . <p> DOG Scale scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested are untenable . In one study , students who were hostile toward homosexuals and who were also highly dogmatic were unaffected by a presentation of the mounting evidence that sexual orientation has , to some extent , biological roots . In contrast , other students who were initially just as hostile toward homosexuals , but who scored low on the DOG Scale , shifted their attitudes markedly toward greater tolerance after learning of this evidence ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 206-207 ) . <p> In a similar vein , I asked a group of students how they would react to a hypothetical discovery of scientifically validated scrolls that proved that the story of Jesus had been largely borrowed from earlier Greek myths . Persons who had indicated on a pretest that they strongly believed that Jesus was the divine son of God , and who also scored high on the DOG Scale , said such a discovery would have no effect on their beliefs . But students who believed just as much in Jesus 's divinity on the pretest , but who scored low on the DOG Scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their beliefs ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 207-208 ) . <p> Finally , in 1994 I pitted the DOG Scale against the D Scale ( Rokeach , 1960 ) in a study of the extent to which students ( a ) had questioned their family religion , ( b ) had gone to potentially disconfirming as well as confirming sources of information about their religion , ( c ) presently had doubts about their faith , and ( d ) would change their religious beliefs if strong evidence showed they were wrong . DOG scores were correlated significantly ( - .20 to - .51 in the expected , negative direction ) with all of these responses . The only statistically significant D Scale correlation ( a +.21 relationship with having questioned the family religion ) pointed in the wrong direction ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 213-214 ) . Method <p> The reader will note that most of these studies involved religion . The reason is simple . Although one can find dogmatic scientists , feminists , environmentalists , and so on , dogmatism seems to arise most often in religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , in the study of zealots mentioned earlier ( Altemeyer , 1996 , 209-213 ) , persons who said their basic outlook was religious proved much more dogmatic than those who built their lives around socialism , capitalism , a personal philosophy  --  or anything else . Similarly , DOG Scale scores pull in their highest correlations ( .60 or better ) with the Religious Fundamentalism Scale ( RF ; Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 157-166 ; Altemeyer &; Hunsberger , 1992 ) . So although the study of dogmatism in other contexts should be pursued , I have found that the easiest way to find dogmatic attitudes is to bring up religion . The present study was accordingly designed to put the empirical validity of the DOG Scale to a further test by seeing whether it could predict reactions to contradictions and inconsistencies in the Bible . <p> Procedure <p> The present study , conducted during the autumns of 1999 and 2000 , began with a large survey that led to a follow-up experiment . Introductory psychology students at the University of Manitoba ( N = 781 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a secret number of their own choosing . The booklet contained the Religious Fundamentalism , Right-Wing Authoritarianism , and DOG Scales , as well as other material such as questions soliciting the individual 's religious background and current level of church attendance . ( The vast majority had Christian backgrounds but no longer attended church regularly . ) The following two questions about the Bible appeared between the RF and the RWA Scales : <p> 1 . To what extent did God write the Bible ? <p> ( ) Not at all . The Bible is a collection of religious writings including myths , history , and moral teachings . It was produced completely by humans with no divine/supernatural participation . <p> ( ) The Bible contains truths that God wants us to know . But God did not " write " or " inspire " the Bible any more than God wrote or inspired Shakespeare 's plays . <p> ( ) The Bible was divinely inspired . Every word in it came directly from God through God 's chosen writers . <p> 2 . Does the Bible contain errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Bible is free of any errors , contradictions , or inconsistencies . <p> ( ) Yes . There are a few errors , contradictions , and inconsistencies in the Bible . ( ) Yes . The Bible has many errors , contradictions , and inconsistencies in it . <p> We shall focus on the students who said , in response to the first question , that every word in the Bible came directly from God , and then said that the Bible is free of any errors , contradictions , and inconsistencies . <p> When the students turned in their booklets , they received a slip of paper inviting them to participate in a two-phase " second study " starting the following week . The first phase , the slip said , " will ask you to interpret certain passages from the Bible . " The second phase , it continued , would involve a take-home survey due a week later . Experimental credits , it was stated , would be given only to students who completed both phases . <p> Participants who showed up for Phase 1 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the front were printed , in four side-by-side columns , the different Gospel accounts of the resurrection of Jesus in the order Mark , Matthew , Luke , and John ( from the 1989 New Revised Standard Version of the Bible ) . After reading these , the students were directed to turn to the other side of the sheet , where they were asked to write down their secret number from the booklet study . Then they read a paragraph which noted that the four Gospel accounts of the resurrection seemed replete with inconsistencies and contradictions . Many of these were then cited . Who went to the tomb where Jesus was buried ? What time of day was it ? Was there a great earthquake ? Were there Roman guards at the tomb ? Were there angels ? How many ? Who , if anyone , saw Jesus ? Did Jesus let anyone touch him ? Did the witnesses tell anyone what they saw ? Which apostles , if any , then went to the tomb ? And so on . ( One finds little agreement among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first question , for example , all four accounts have different lists of who went to the tomb . ) <p> After reading this impeaching paragraph , the participants were asked , " How do you explain these apparent inconsistencies and contradictions ? " Four choices were offered , plus an invitation to add another if none of these suited the student : There are , in fact , no contradictions or inconsistencies in the four accounts . ( Please explain , because most people would say there seem to be many contradictions and inconsistencies . ) The contradictions and inconsistencies are due to human errors in translation , recording , etc . But God 's original inspired account , written by the evangelists , was consistent and error free . ( If so , how can one tell what in today 's Bible is God 's original message , not a later mistake ? ) There are many contradictions and inconsistencies in the four accounts . Each evangelist was reporting what he thought happened , and some of them got details wrong . But this does not change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jesus rose from the dead that Sunday morning , and that is what is important . ( If so , is the Bible , then , a book containing some central truths , but also many untrustworthy and erroneous details ? How , then , can one tell what is the truth , and what is not , in the Bible ? ) The contradictions and inconsistencies do not surprise me at all , because I consider the story of the resurrection of Jesus a false myth , and myths often develop different versions as they are spread . ( If so , why did the Christian church not " clean up " the accounts to make them consistent before making them " gospel " ? And how do you explain the fact that so many millions of people believe that Jesus rose from the dead ? ) <p> After turning in their explanations of the differing accounts , students received their Phase 2 assignment of this second study , which was to take a copy of the Phase 1 sheet home , discuss the matter with whomever they wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically mentioned ) , write their reconsidered answer to the question , turn it in , and receive their credits . Students were also given the telephone numbers of several on-campus counseling services and the university chaplain 's office in case they found the experiment upsetting . I introduced Phase 2 to give the students a copy of the experimental materials that they could take to parents , friends , and ministers for consultation and reassurance , if needed . I also wanted to see how well students would recover any beliefs that had slipped because of the side-by-side presentation of the four Easter stories  --  which , you will see , shows how badly I anticipated the effect of that presentation . Results <p> Of the 781 students who answered the preliminary booklet , 207 said that the Bible is just a collection of human religious writings , 298 responded that God had no more hand in writing the Bible than he had in composing Shakespeare 's plays , and 269 said that the Bible was divinely inspired ( 7 did not answer the first question ) . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 452 believed that the Bible contained a few errors , and 178 said that it contained many errors ( 12 students did not answer the second question ) . Looking at both sets of responses , 113 students ( 14% of the 781 ) responded both " God chose every word , " and " the Bible is free of any errors , contradictions , or inconsistencies . " As one might predict from previous findings ( Altemeyer , 1996 ; Altemeyer &; Hunsberger , 1997 ) , these 113 students , compared with the rest of the sample , proved significantly more authoritarian ( their mean RWA score was 62% higher : 145.1 vs. 89.7 , SDs = 41.9 vs. 35.2 , respectively ) , relatively dogmatic ( their mean DOG score was 65% higher : 117.6 vs. 71.1 , SDs = 28.7 vs. 23.6 , respectively ) relatively fundamentalist in religious outlook ( their mean RF score was 73% higher : 139.4 vs. 80.4 , SDs = 23.4 vs. 25.9 , respectively ) , and , especially , more likely to attend church ( 444% higher : 4.0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.4 , respectively ) . They belonged disproportionately to fundamentalist evangelical denominations such as Baptist , Alliance , Pentecostal , and Mennonite . <p> One hundred and thirty-one students accepted the invitation to serve in the second study , including 31 " God chose every word ; perfect Bible " believers ( 24% of the 131 ) . How did these 31 true believers respond to the differing Gospel accounts of the resurrection ? Most of them ( 17 ) still insisted there are , in fact , no inconsistencies or contradictions in the accounts . Their most common explanation was that the evangelists were like witnesses to an automobile accident ; they saw things from different perspectives and reported accordingly . Others gave no explanation of their position or simply wrote responses such as " You have to have faith " or " The Bible is all truth . " The other 14 students who had said in the first study that God wrote every word in a perfect Bible modified this position and split fairly evenly between the " errors in translation " rationale and " the evangelists got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scale explain the difference between the " insisters " and the " modifiers " ? The 17 who maintained , in the face of challenging evidence to the contrary , that no inconsistencies or contradictions exist in the Bible , had a mean DOG score of 133.5 ( SD = 24.1 ) . The 14 others , who were also " true believers " in the first study , but who then conceded in the face of the challenging evidence that some inconsistencies or contradictions do exist in the Bible , had a mean DOG score of 114.5 ( SD = 26.2 ) . The latter mean is , to be sure , relatively high given that the mean DOG score for the initial 781 students equaled 78.0 . But it is significantly lower than the 133.5 mean of the insisters by a one-tailed test at the .025 level , t(30) = 2.09 . In comparison , the insisters and the modifiers were not differentiated as well by their respective scores on the RWA Scale ( Ms = 189.6 vs. 176.6 , SDs = 29.1 vs. 24.7 ) , t(30) = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ms = 139.2 vs. 127.8 , SDs = 16.2 vs. 22.8 ) , t(30) = 1.58 , p &lt; .07 . But the difference in church attendance ( Ms = 5.88 vs. 4.00 times per month , SDs = 2.5 vs. 2.0 ) , t(30) = 2.33 , p &lt; .02 , proved more highly significant than the DOG difference . <p> A week later , students completed Phase 2 of the second study simply by returning the Gospel accounts and reactions sheet they had taken home . Almost everyone had the same opinion as before . But 13 of the 131 second-study students failed to return these sheets and , thereby , forfeited the experimental credits they had already earned . Of these thirteen , 8 ( i.e. , 62% ) had been " God wrote every word ; perfect Bible " students , who only constituted 24% of the sample in the second study . Most ( 6 ) of these 8 had been insisters after they read the Gospel accounts . Discussion <p> Dogmatism has been defined here as relatively unchangeable , unjustified certainty . The experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious context . Some participants said that ( a ) every word in the Bible came directly from God and ( b ) it is free of any contradictions or inconsistencies . Numerous apparent contradictions and inconsistencies in the resurrection accounts were then pointed out . Yet most of the true believers still maintained that there were none ; their certainty seems difficult to justify and highly resistant to change . <p> How can one understand the insisters ? Their most common explanation of the differences among the Easter-morning accounts  --  that the evangelists were like witnesses to an automobile accident and thus wrote things from different points of view  --  in fact admits that contradictions and inconsistencies exist . It just proposes a rationale for their existence . Yet the insisters concluded that this argument shows that imperfections do not really exist . Logically , it makes no sense . <p> One could infer that the insisters have weak reasoning powers in general . But however much they may put logic into neutral regarding their own beliefs , they can be competently critical about other people 's beliefs ( Altemeyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suggest that the trusted sources who taught them that the Bible was dictated by God and was perfect also provided the " witnesses rationale " about its apparent imperfections . Neither the initial teaching nor the inoculation against later challenges was probably subjected to intense rumination by the insisters . Psycho logically , they proceeded from their faith in a perfect Bible written by God . Some of them wrote that anything disputing the Bible must , therefore , be wrong . <p> I think we can correctly classify this assertion as dogmatic denial . Such insisters appeared immune , not only to disconfirming scientific evidence about such things as the age of the earth and the evolution of the species but also to disconfirming evidence in the Bible itself . As one of the DOG Scale items says , " I am so sure I am right about the important things in life , there is no evidence that could convince me otherwise . " As another item goes , " There are no discoveries or facts that could possibly make me change my mind about the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an underlying fear that compels the dogmatism ? If you hold that you have found a perfect system of beliefs , have you not painted yourself into a dogmatic corner ? Should just one imperfection be admitted , then other things can be untrue as well , and the sublime comfort of knowing you are completely right evaporates . So if the going gets tough , you have to fall back on dogmatic denial . In this study , some students may even have forgone experimental credits they had already earned rather than deal with the matter further . <p> I am hardly saying that all religious people are dogmatic ; that dogmatism can not be found in other spheres of life ; or that religious dogmatism is more disconcerting than dogmatism found in scientists , clinicians , Marxists , conspiracy theorists , or me . Also , one can not presume that persons who are dogmatic about their religion would also prove dogmatic about less important aspects of their lives . However , the insisters ' behavior smacks of dogmatism and , therefore , it can be used to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale perform ? In the preliminary booklet study involving 781 students , it revealed very large differences between the 113 " God wrote every word ; perfect Bible " students and the other 668 participants . In the second study , some " God wrote every word ; perfect Bible " students , after reading the Easter-morning accounts , still insisted the Bible had no contradictions or inconsistencies . These participants had significantly higher DOG scores than the other " God wrote every word , perfect Bible " students who conceded that imperfections exist in the Bible . <p> The RWA and RF Scales produced weaker versions of the foregoing findings , so the DOG Scale was not just riding piggy-back on stronger , more pertinent measures . Frequency of church attendance proved the best predictor of all but presumably would not be related to dogmatism in nonreligious contexts . <p> Taking stock then , the DOG Scale is a relatively short , internally consistent , reliable measure of dogmatism that is balanced against response sets and appears to be valid . Responses to it correlate with being zealous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 209-213 ) , and it has predicted dogmatic behavior much better than the widely used D Scale did ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 213-214 ) . The present results regarding Biblical accuracy replicate the findings of two similar experiments that involved hostility toward homosexuals ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 206-207 ) and the impact of disconfirming ancient scrolls ( Altemeyer , 1996 , pp. 207-208 ) . Persons with strong beliefs on these issues tended to score high on this new measure of dogmatism ; among the strong believers , those with the highest DOG scores changed less  --  if at all  --  when evidence showed they might well be wrong . I hope that other researchers working on dogmatism find the present results interesting and put the DOG Scale to new tests . <p> Address correspondence to Bob Altemeyer , Department of Psychology , The University of Manitoba , Winnipeg , Manitoba R3T 2N2 , Canada ; altemey@cc.Umanitoba.CA ( e-mail ) . <p>
