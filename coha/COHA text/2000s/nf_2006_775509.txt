1967 // Even through the haze of smoke in the dimly lit lounge , Sam Ybarra glimpsed Ken Green as he walked through the door . " Kenny , over here ! " shouted Ybarra over the music blaring from a tape deck . Meeting , the two friends hugged as the other soldiers looked up from their beers and shot glasses . // It had been nearly a year since they arrived in Vietnam , and this was one of the few weekends the two could meet on a break . They 'd been waiting it out , and now at long last it was time to down beers and later slip into the brothels that lined the streets of Kontum . Green introduced Sam to two buddies , Leon Fletcher and Ed Beck . For days , Ken had been telling them about his time with " Crazy Sam " - cruising the streets of Globe , Arizona , in Green 's blue 1964 Chevelle SS , guzzling Ripple with the Rolling Stones ' " Satisfaction " crackling over the radio . And now , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friends were together again . // To most people , they were as opposite as they were close : Green was boyish , good-looking , and cocky-the type of guy who could turn heads in a crowded room . Ybarra was dark skinned , with a round , pockmarked face-awkwardly shy unless he was drinking . But for all their differences , they shared something in common : they were constantly in trouble . // Green was known for his temper-quick to start fights with other students at Globe High School , regardless of their age and size . Though he stood only five feet , five inches , he rarely backed down . Everyone knew to stay away from him . As a junior , Green had brutally attacked another student who was a year older and a foot taller for looking at him the wrong way in the hallway . Dozens of classmates watched in horror as he pummeled the student senseless on the floor . It took three teachers to pull him away . // Back home , on some summer nights , Green would sneak out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ridge overlooking a dam on nearby Lake Roosevelt . Patiently , he would wait for Sheriff Dutch Lake to drive onto the roadway over the dam , and then Green would shoot out the lights on the road before fleeing into the darkness . The sheriff suspected it was Green but could never prove it . Nor could the sheriff prove that Green was the one who rolled a boulder onto the dirt runway at the tiny Lake Roosevelt airstrip , shutting down flights for hours . By the time authorities arrived to remove the large rock , Green and the two buddies who carried out the prank had vanished . But they left their calling card on the boulder : the words " Fuck You , " painted in black . // His father , Melvin , was a laborer for the state highway department who also ran Carson 's Caf ? , a diner on Lake Roosevelt . He was quick to discipline his son for misbehaving , sometimes beating him in front of his friends , but those beatings only made Green more defiant . Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath , ordering him to work extra hours at the diner with his sister and older brother . Instead of washing dishes , Green stole his father 's boat , later flipping the craft in a race on the other side of the lake . The beatings that followed his pranks only seemed to make him more aggressive , and by his late teens , he was getting into fights almost weekly . // Ybarra was angry , but for more obvious reasons : he was painfully aware of his own physical appearance and never felt accepted in the small mining community that looked down on Mexicans and Native Americans . Sam was burdened with the shame and angst of being a " half-breed , " and his longing for a father who had died when Ybarra was five was profound . ( Manuel Ybarra was a truck driver for the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company when he stopped at a bar on the way home and was stabbed to death in a brawl. ) // Besides getting into fights , he was arrested three times for underage drinking and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of high school , guzzling beer and wine behind Mark 's or Pinky's-the two nightspots in town that catered to Native Americans . He was too young to go inside , so he would wait outside the door and ask elders from the reservation to buy him a Coors or a pint of Thunderbird . // In Globe , Indians and whites were n't supposed to socialize . It had been that way for generations . But by the 1960s , some of those rules began to be challenged . Though Ybarra and others from the reservation went to " Indian schools " during their grade-school years in the 1950s , they were now attending the white public schools . Whites and Indians were at this point playing on the same football and basketball teams , and even joined in school dances . Still , the older Indians would tell Ybarra to stay out of the white bar , The Huddle . // Green and Ybarra did n't meet until high school , where they began hanging out in the parking lot before classes . Though they came from different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and were quick to pick fights . Ybarra was an outcast , and Green was becoming one . // Their bond became deeper after Green began driving , and the two started skipping school and drinking . " No one knows the shit that Sam has gone through , " Green told family members who tried to discourage him from associating with Ybarra . It was them against the world , as ferocious as suns. // And now , here they were in late May 1967 , ten thousand miles from home and oblivious to the soldiers around them in the bar . They ordered Black Labels and toasted each other . // " At least we 're both still alive , " said Green . // The night before they had enlisted , the two friends had sat in Green 's car downing beers when they heard a radio broadcast about the war . They began talking about joining the Army . Sam had challenged his friend : " If you do it , I 'll do it . " // Green had agreed . As a boy growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the paratroopers dropping from the sky during training exercises . And when Green and Ybarra hunted deer and quail in the nature preserves near the lake , they often talked about what it would be like to be soldiers . Besides , there was nothing for them in Globe , except working in the copper mines . Ybarra knew all about that life : his relatives had toiled underground for years , and he did n't want any part of it . // The next day , they showed up at the local recruiting office and enlisted under the Army 's buddy system . Together they entered the 101st Airborne in January 1966 and , after jump training at Fort Benning , Georgia , were sent to Vietnam , Ybarra in July and Green a month later . // It had been about ten months since they arrived in Vietnam , leaving behind their lives in Arizona , and for most of that period , they were assigned to different units . Green was in a mortar platoon but spent most of his time humping in the mountains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporadic contact with the enemy . Ybarra 's experiences were different-and it showed even in his uniform . Unlike the others in the lounge that night , he was n't wearing the traditional olive green . Instead , he was dressed in tiger-striped fatigues and a soft-brimmed jungle cap , and he carried his own sidearm and hunting knife . // Tiger Force , the 101st Airborne 's version of Special Forces . Badass of the badass. // Ybarra had actually been sent to a signal corps after arriving in Vietnam , but quickly grew bored and asked to be transferred to the Tigers in early 1967 . He did n't regret his move . As soon as he joined the platoon of forty-five men , he felt part of a special team of soldiers who were treated differently than the grunts in the line companies . He remembered the first time a battalion commander addressed his platoon in Phan Rang : " You 're the Tigers , men , " he reminded them before they went on a reconnaissance mission . " The Tigers always get it done , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exceptional group that allowed no exceptions . // Tiger Force was founded in November 1965 by Major David Hackworth to " outguerrilla the guerrillas , " a platoon known as a " recondo unit " because it was to carry out reconnaissance and commando functions . The model for Apocalypse Now ' s Colonel Kilgore , Hackworth was a hell-for-leather soldier of savage brilliance who had revealed himself as a daring hero during the Korean War . In Vietnam , he had realized that conventional warfare was a dead end . Following his lead , his commanders found the best way to locate the new enemy was to blend into the jungle terrain . That meant breaking into small teams , donning camouflage , and carrying enough rations and supplies to last several weeks . They would leave themselves behind . // Such was Hackworth 's answer to an enemy that moved in intricate underground tunnels and carried out hit-and-run tactics . // Beyond surveillance , the Tigers were often ordered to perform impossible maneuvers , such as acting as a blocking unit for retreating guerrilla forces and often relieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 at My Canh II , an area covered by rice paddies and mountains in the Central Highlands , the Tigers were trapped by a well-fortified enemy until the unit 's own commander , Lieutenant James Gardner , heroically charged three bunkers . Gardner was killed , but his actions allowed his platoon to escape , and he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . At Dak To , a city just thirty-five kilometers from Laos , eleven Tigers were killed on June 11 , 1966 , when they pursued a fleeing North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) regiment . In that case , as it would be often , they had been the first unit sent to face the enemy . Let the other guys mop up-the Tigers wanted fresh blood , even if it meant some of it might be their own . // Only forty-five men were accepted in the Tigers , and that was only after three months of combat experience and a screening process by commanders that included a battery of questions , mostly centered on the soldiers ' willingness to kill . // Ybarra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said he could kill without hesitation-using a knife , M16 , or even his own hands . It made no difference . Ever since jump school at Fort Benning , Georgia , he had been looking for a home . He hated the structure of the line companies-the chain of command , the rules , the officers . The Tigers were different , part Green Beret , part line company . They would break into small teams , two or three men at a time , creep deep into the jungles , " and do whatever the hell you want to do , " he was fond of saying . When the commanders told him he was accepted into the platoon , he was " thrilled . " // After several rounds of beer , Sam sank down into his chair . There was so much smoke in the lounge it was almost impossible to see across the room . Not that there was anything special worth noticing . The room was a typical makeshift military bar , with round Formica-top tables , folding chairs , and thin wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stench of cigarettes and whiskey . There were hundreds of these cheap versions of nightspots in South Vietnam that were supposed to remind American soldiers of the watering holes they left behind . The only prop in the lounge was the flickering Black Label neon light dangling over the bar . // Ybarra guzzled the last of his beer , leaned over , and began telling Green and the others about the Tigers ' most recent battle . On May 15 Ybarra and the Tigers were called to a valley west of Duc Pho in the heart of the Central Highlands-Quang Ngai province-where another Army reconnaissance unit , the Hawks , was pinned down by enemy fire . In the late morning , with a dozen Tiger Force soldiers at the bottom of the valley , the enemy launched a surprise attack . " They were fuckin ' all over the place , " Ybarra angrily recalled . Well-fortified enemy bunkers at the top of the valley suddenly opened up , and NVA soldiers began shelling the helpless Tigers below . // Led by the Tigers ' commander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were forced down by a flurry of mortars and .50-caliber machine-gun fire . For hours , the platoon was at the bottom of the basin , dodging artillery , grenades , and bullet fire . Tiger Force radioed for helicopters to evacuate the wounded , but each time a chopper tried to land , it was forced to leave because of enemy artillery . One helicopter was able to land in a rice paddy but was immediately hit by fire and destroyed . // By early afternoon , Tiger Force was no closer to escaping and was running low on ammunition . But the platoon finally caught a break when the soldiers found a new position and were able to call in American air strikes without being hit . For two hours , U.S. jets dropped bombs on the bunkers . The combination of air strikes and the arrival of some additional American troops allowed the Tigers to escape . By the end of the day , two were dead and twenty-five wounded . For some of the injured , including Lieutenant Forbes , the war was over . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were down " and unable to go back out on maneuvers until they could find reinforcements . The battalion officers were trying to bring in new volunteers . Now Ybarra did his part . He turned to Green . " You need to come with me , Kenny . You need to be a Tiger . " // Green always knew when Ybarra was serious ; his smile would disappear and his eyes would narrow . He had seen the look many times before , and he saw it now . // Vietnam in early 1967 was still vastly different from what it was to become at year 's end . There was still a sense of patriotism that had not yet been eroded by the bitterness of the Tet Offensive and casualties that would soon turn most Americans against the war . Until now , most of the conflict had been marked by skirmishes and , if not wild optimism , at least a sense of inevitable triumph . // Through most of the conversation , Green 's friend Leon Fletcher was quiet . But after several minutes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guys , Kenny , " he said . " You 're going to get yourself killed . " // Fletcher had looked up to Green . Ken had been the one who took the time to show Leon the basics of survival , from throwing him to the ground during sniper attacks to teaching him how to avoid booby traps . And now Fletcher thought it was time to return the favor . // Green was quiet for a moment , and then he turned to Fletcher . " At this point , I just want to kill a lot of them . My job is to kill . " // Ed Beck joined in . After several months in South Vietnam , he was looking for real action-not just maneuvers or air strikes with no real targets . He had come to Vietnam to escape , not just from the boring western suburbs of Chicago but from a wife who was making his life miserable . " How do we get in ? " he asked . // Before Ybarra could answer , Fletcher interrupted again . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay alive . Why do you want to join a fucking recon unit ? " // Ybarra quickly cut him off . " Look , man , stay out of this , " he said , jabbing a finger at Fletcher . " Do n't be telling Kenny what he 's going to do . We go way back . " There was not a trace of friendliness in his comment . // Ybarra 's anger may have been what Green most admired , especially when his fury involved protecting Ken 's right to do whatever the hell he wanted to do . Green turned to his friend . " I 'm in , man . Tell me what I need to do . " // " If you 're going , I 'm going , " Beck said . // For Green and Beck , it was their way of finally taking part . Like so many others in the bar that night , they had been in high school when the first U.S. fighting units arrived in Da Nang in March 1965 , and had watched the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of Communism . //
