What does it mean when a company under criminal investigation sweeps out three top executives but only one is fired ? That happened last week at Freddie Mac , the giant government-chartered mortgage company whose board grew impatient with management 's internal probe of accounting irregularities that surfaced in January . Freddie Mac 's president , David Glenn , was terminated , but the former chief financial officer , Vaughn Clarke , merely resigned and the former CEO , Leland Brendsel , retired at 61 . The varying nature of their departures has grabbed the attention of Republican Congressman Richard Baker , who chairs a House financial-services subcommittee . Sources tell TIME that Baker has demanded documents in searching for clues that the two execs not fired were given an easy out . ( Brendsel stands to collect $24.3 million severance ; Clarke 's package was not disclosed . ) Glenn is the only executive specifically implicated so far . Freddie Mac says he refused to cooperate with the internal probe and at one point ripped pages out of a diary . The Justice Department and the Securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stakes could n't be higher . Freddie Mac holds or insures mortgages totaling $1.3 trillion . Any lasting scandal could drive up its borrowing costs and lead to higher mortgage rates  --  slowing a housing market that for three years has been the economy 's main driver .  --  By Daniel Kadlec and Adam Zagorin
