Poised at the top of a hill , resting on your ski poles , you gaze over the tops of the pine trees . Smoke curls from the chimneys of the lodge far below . Skiers schuss through the snow , winding down the slope , raising a fine spray as they snake around trees . At the base of the hill , other skiers move like marchers along level trails , crossing the field on white paths . Ready to make a run , you pull your warm wool cap down over your ears , adjust your poles and skis , and bend your knees slightly . Whoosh ! You shove off , your poles digging in , moving you forward . The frosty air stings your cheeks ; the snowy ground whizzes by beneath you . Soon you 're moving so fast that it feels as though you 're flying ! Skiing is a winter sport for everyone , from young children to adults . The two kinds of snow skiingdownhill and cross-country-take balance , coordination , and practice , but the effort is well worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special equipment : skis , boots , bindings , and poles . The equipment can be expensive , so you may want to borrow or rent your equipment at first . Later , if you begin to ski regularly , you may want to purchase your own . Ski size is very important . If you 're a beginner , your skis should reach no higher than eye level when you stand them on end . A short ski offers better control as you learn simple turns , curves , and stops . Experts at a ski shop will help you decide what ski and pole lengths are best for your height , weight , and skill level . Bindings hold your boots to your skis . They are made to release the skis automatically if you fall . Be sure to have your bindings fitted correctly by a skiing expert . Skis must release properly during a fall to avoid injuries to your feet , ankles , and legs . Boots are usually made of stiff plastic with molded foam inside . Fit is important-your boots should n't be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll also need warm clothes . You should wear several layers of clothing so you can remove items if you get too warm . You 'll also need a hat , gloves , water-resistant ski pants , and a jacket . Goggles protect your eyes from the bright sun and snow . Learning How To begin , start with the gentler slopes where you can learn the basics . Sign up for a series of lessons at a YMCA or ski school , ask for help from a skiing friend , or join a ski club at school . In climates where it never snows , some people practice on a wide , moving ramp , watching their moves in a mirror . Warming Up As with any sport , fitness and conditioning are also important for skiing . Anything you do to exercise your heart and lungs helps keep you fit . Sports such as in-line skating , ice skating , or skateboarding involve moves similar to skiing and will help you develop balance . Surfing and waterskiing help , too . The key is regular exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of time you exercise . Skiing requires strength , balance , and endurance . One way to prepare for ski season is to do leg conditioning exercises . You can do knee bends , toe touches , inner-thigh stretches , and toe pulls ( hold onto a chair and grab behind you for the toes of first one foot , then the other ) . Some skiers climb the risers in a football stadium or run up and down stairs to build their endurance . Downhill Skiing Standing and Walking : Before you hit the slopes , get used to the feel of skis by standing and moving around in them at home . Notice how the poles help you balance , Practice moving forward , reaching with your right pole as you slide your left ski forward . Then switch and reach with your left pole and right ski . Make this movement as smooth as possible . Skating : This skiing move is much like ice-skating : use the inner edges of the skis to push forward , your knees slightly bent .

Once you 're down , get your skis parallel ( side-by-side ) across the hill . Do n't point them downhill , or you 'll slide forward . Put your poles together and push into the hill to help you get up . Ski instructors will have you practice falling and getting up . Side-stepping : You can make your way uphill by side-stepping . Stand with your skis parallel to each other and pointed across the slope . With knees slightly bent , first lift the uphill ski , then the downhill ski , slowly side-stepping up the hill . Use your poles to help vou balance . Straight Running or Schussing : When you 're ready for a straight downhill run , relax your knees , elbows , and ankles . Center your weight over the middle of the skis , knees slightly bent . Use your poles to push off .

Tip your skis onto their inside edges . Be careful not to lean too far forward as you snowplow . For the trickier hockey stop , turn your skis quickly to the side , across the hill , and push your weight into the blade of the downhill ski . Cross-Country Skiing Another name for cross-country skiing is Nordic skiing since it 's the way many people get around during the snowy winters in Nordic , or Scandinavian , countries . Unlike downhill skiing , you do n't need slopes for cross-country skiing . You can cross-country ski almost anywhere-your backyard , in fields , or on hills without too many bushes and trees . The equipment and skills needed for cross-country skiing are different from those needed for downhill skiing . The skis are lighter and narrower than downhill skis . The boots are softer and more flexible , and they are clamped to the ski at the toe only . Cross-country skiers use their poles much more than downhill skiers do . Cross-country skiing is great exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smooth rhythm . The gliding motion is similar to ice skating . The best parts of cross-country skiing are the freedom of movement and low cost . You can ski just about anywhere you want . You may spot a deer as you cross-country ski in a quiet forest . You can stop and rest whenever you want . Because you can go at your own pace , people of all ages enjoy cross-country skiing . Putting It Together To ski , you must condition your body with practice , practice , practice . It does n't matter if you 're short or tall , heavy or thin . This is a sport you can do solo , with a friend , a school club , or your family . If you get really good at skiing , you may want to enter competitions . <p>
