REVIEW TALYA BAHARAL One Mellon Center Gallery , Pittsburgh , PA * January 14 - February 27 , 2005 // One can think of a number of artists who play with the widely dissimilar properties of the materials they use in their work . Lead and marble juxtaposed with mango stones ( Veronica Ryan ) , glass with feathers ( Masami Koda ) and the adventures of a loose body of radical sculptors quickly come to mind . Historically these ventures have tended to be experimental and beset with issues of conservation . Degas 's Little Dancer Aged Fourteen makes sense as a wax model with the frequently replaced muslin tutu ; on the same work in bronze , the muslin tutu ( again , often replaced ) is perhaps less easily accepted . Talya Baharal 's work in " Big Steel , Little Steel , " at the One Mellon Center Gallery , a satellite space of the Society for Contemporary C raft , brings tog et her steel with paper , another unconventional commixture that some might find almost shocking . Baharal , who lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her jewelry , sleek metal artifacts that seem like miniaturized modernist sculpture , hint ing at organic and industrial forms . As often as not she utilizes steel wire in their fabrication . It is her use of steel that gave rise to this exhibition , the result of an artist residency last year at the society . With the collaboration of high school students and other com m unity members , Baharal set out , in late 2004 , to collect scrap steel that had become embedded in the Pittsburgh environment . The city 's wealth was built on steel , and many lively and rotting traces of it survive , contributing to a special , local aesthetic . In contrast to Baharal 's polished jewelry , the urban finish is one of rust and decay , incorporating a more poignant sense of beauty . The random gathering of scrap metal I not too big , please ! ) , or city beachcombing , was evidenced in the exhibition 's practice a common one at the society ) of displaying the raw materials used by the artist . These items-rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination are evocative , certainly enough to attract the attention of the casual gleaner in a neglected brownfield . But Baharal 's sculptures have undergone a further metamorphosis through their interaction with paper pulp . Baharal 's interest in papermakingand its sculptural potential has been evolving over recent years . Paper may seem weak as a structural medium , but other cultures have overcome this mind-set . When a paper skin thrown wet over a skein of tangled wire dries , it can provide remarkable tensile strength . ( Some Japanese architectural elements and some early aviational constructions , from kites to biplanes , depend on the same principles . And each material does not shed its essential feeling of fragility , which translucence helps to impart . Thus the normal characteristics of the ingredients a re subverted-the steel is softened , the paper is hardened . The exhibition also harked back to radical approaches to drawing . Alexander Calder 's wire sculptures , seen as three-dimensional drawing , see m to be the allusion in Baharal 's more abstract sculpture . The re also may be a reference to recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires inserted into white plastered walls play wittily with the im permanence of graphite marks on paper . Though their forms are diverse and suggestive , Talya Baharal 's works are untitled , and this can be madden ing , if understandable . It would n't be unreasonable to call the pieces variations on a theme . Scale is critical : the essential sculptural properties appear monumental in so small a compass , and graphic marks aspire to mural effects ; the minute discolorations and rustinessof the handmade paper-pulp " skins " evoke complex patination . And in the end , all the variations convey the precision of the jeweler 's hand and eye . - GRAHAM SHEARING Photograph Unfitted , 2004 , steel wire , found steel objects , paper pulp , 58 by 42 by 6 inches .
