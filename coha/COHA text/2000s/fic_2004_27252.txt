The Mill Dam Charlotte turned eleven in the spring of 1820 . For her birthday , Mama and Papa gave her the new book by Sir Walter Scott , the famous novelist who was spoken of so highly in all the papers . Last winter Mama had read his novel Waverley to the family , holding them all entranced  --  from Lewis , who was nearly a man now , right on down to Mary , who would be seven in June . Charlotte especially had been captivated by Mr. Scott 's tale of life in faraway Scotland , where Mama and Papa had grown up . She had been sorry to see the book end . Now there was the new one , satisfyingly heavy in her hand , beckoning with adventure . Ivanhoe . It was a name full of mystery and promise . Charlotte was tempted to run off and read it all alone , in some quiet sun-dappled nook beneath the blossoming apple trees . She knew , though , that the rest of the family was as eager to hear the story as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same expression he wore whenever Mama placed a platter of roast goose on the table . So Charlotte handed it back to Mama and asked if she would read it to the family after she finished Robinson Crusoe , which they were halfway through . Besides , quiet nooks for reading were in short supply this spring . There was scarcely a corner within a mile of Charlotte 's house that was free from the constant bang and bellow of construction . Men were building a dam across the Roxbury Flats . Two dams , really . The main one , the Mill Dam , was to stretch from the end of Beacon Street in Boston westward across the Charles River to Brookline . A smaller dam , the Cross Dam , would extend from the end of Tide Mill Lane and cut across the flats to intersect the Mill Dam at its halfway point . For over a year the wagons had been rumbling past the Tucker house toward the construction site . The tidal marsh that had once rung with the cries of heron and gull now lay chastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tide Mill Lane was not a lane anymore . It was a road : a stern road , all business , impatient with amblers and children . Mary had nearly been run down by a team of horses last week , and the driver had not stopped to apologize but had actually cursed at her as she darted in terror out of his way . Papa had walked out to the Cross Dam to speak with the foreman . The foreman had been sorry ; he had little girls of his own at home . But he could not , he shrugged , be responsible for the behavior of every teamster who hauled a load of stone from the quarry . " I 'd keep my little ones off the road , if I were you , Tucker , " he had cautioned . " Your house is in a devil of a spot for accidents , ai n't it ? I do n't know how you can stand it . " Mama 's eyes had blazed when Papa re-counted the story at supper that evening . " How we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What choice have we ? Were n't consulted , were we , when the fools in Boston were fighting each other for a share in these blasted dams ? " " Easy , me love , " said Papa lightly , in the same gentle tone he used to calm a rearing horse . " There was naught we could do aboot it then , and there 's little noow . " Mama 's withering glare showed exactly what she thought of the horse-calming voice . " Dinna you gentle me , Lew Tucker , " she said . " I 've a right to be angry , and you ken it well . " She glared across the length of the table at him , while the children looked on in silence . Papa held her gaze , his face solemn , until suddenly Mama laughed and shook her head . " What am I sayin ' ? You 're angrier than I am , " she said . She passed a hand over her eyes . " Mary , " she said , the edge gone from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lass . All o ' you . Be careful . Times have changed on Tide Mill Lane . I fear ' twill get worse before it gets better . " It was not like Mama to be pessimistic . Charlotte stared at her , troubled , but the merry light came back to Mama 's eyes and she teased Tom about coming to the table with soot on his nose . Mama was unhappy about the Mill Dam , but she was not going to let it spoil a nice supper . Nor would Mama let the dam ruin a beautiful spring . The week after Charlotte 's birthday Mama sorted through the packets of seeds she had saved from last year 's crop of pumpkins , squash , corn , and beans . She set Charlotte and Lydia to work planting the vegetable garden while she and Mary sowed fennel , basil , thyme , and dill in the herb garden beside the house . The two gardens were separated by a low stone wall that Papa had made long ago . Mama 's herbs were famous in Roxbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at brewing them into healing teas and ointments . People came from all over town to buy her remedies for gout , stomachache , and cough . Charlotte , laboring over a long row of onion sets , wished Mama could brew a remedy for aching muscles  --  at least one that she would allow Charlotte to take . Mama 's pain-relieving willow-bark potion was much in demand , but she never gave it to children unless they were feverish . Charlotte did n't even ask . But she and Lydia entertained themselves by thinking up tonics they 'd like to invent to make planting time easier . Charlotte wanted an infusion that would make her so strong , she could lift the hoe as if it were a feather . Lydia wanted one to keep the blackflies away . " And the mosquitoes , too , while I 'm at it , " she added . " They 'll be along soon enough , I expect . " Continues ...
