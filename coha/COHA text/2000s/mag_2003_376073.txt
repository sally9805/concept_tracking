Pleased with its performance in still cameras and M players , Panasonic is taking its SD memory card to the brave , relatively new world of digital video . The SVAV100 ( $999.95 ) is the first DVD-quality camcorder to rely solely on flash memory to store footage . The decision allowed Panasonic to drop the bulkier moving parts required to write to DVD or MiniDV cassettes . The result : a full-featured camcorder with a 10x optical zoom and a 2.5in . LCD monitor that really will fit into a pocket of your jeans . Unfortunately , also shrinking is the amount of footage you can store . The 512-MB SD card that comes with the camcorder can hold only 10 minutes of video at the highest quality and 20 minutes at " good enough . " A 1-GB card will hit stores this spring .  --  By Wilson Rothman
