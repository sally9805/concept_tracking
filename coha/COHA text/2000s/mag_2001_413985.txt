GARDENING FOR THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS Four ways to create an easy-care landscape Photograph Photograph Near Masonville , Colorado , yellow alyssum and daisies ( Thelesperma filifolium ) , red firecracker penstemon , blue catmint , albums , and other hardy perennials color Lauren Springer 's rocky slope . ABOVE : A feather-lined bird 's nest . // Late afternoon on a warm day is a magical time in a natural garden . Rosy light bathes trees , shrubs , and colorful perennials then , and turns seed heads to spun gold . Blossoms with the ephemeral beauty of wildflowers as though lit from within , and a gentle breeze stirs ornamental grasses into a lyrical dance . Mornings glorious too , when fattening buds sparkle with dew and the air is fresh and still . But then any time is special when scent and motion , plants and creatures , water , serenity , and joyous informality come together . Much has been written in recent years about creating gardens in tune with the earth 's cycles and seasons , using as models the land and its natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn of the 21st century , has the natural gardening movement really begun to go mainstream . Forward-thinking landscape architects and designers are installing gardens that are appropriate to their regions and climates . Gardeners too are more eager to surround their homes with natural  --  looking , easy-care gardens that sit lightly on the land . As you peruse seed catalogs this month and plan ahead to spring planting , consider choosing plants and practices that will invite nature into your own backyard . What is a natural garden ? For some Westerners , a natural garden is decidedly green-a rich tapestry of trees , shrubs , and ornamental grasses . For others , it 's a cluster of natives with endearing names that belie their toughness : fairy duster or pussy toes ; woolly blue curls , shooting star , or silktassel ; Mexican hat or sugar bush . For still others , it 's a carnival of colorful flowers , such as cosmos and catmint , salvias and sunflowers , blooming together in glorious anarchy . Or it 's a backyard habitat for birds and butterflies-a nursery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creatures that call the garden home . A natural garden can be all of these things or none of them . But all natural gardens have four things in common . NATURAL GARDENS ARE ALIVE . Butterflies alight here to sip nectar from a flower . Honeybees buzz , and ladybugs scuttle among the leaves , foraging for aphids . Look closely among the foliage and you might find a hummingbird nest woven from pine needles and lined with tiny mosses and downy feathers . Birds , bugs , frogs , dragonflies , earthworms , and lacewings are all part of this magnificent microcosm .

RIGHT : A northern leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESPECT NATURE 'S PRICELESS RESOURCES . Where the climate is and ( as in much of the West ) , plants are chosen to withstand dry summers and drought , ultimately conserving water . At least some of the paving is porous enough to allow rainfall to pass through it to plant roots , rather than running off to the street . Leaf litter is turned to compost that enriches the soil . Grass clippings left on lawns break down to form nitrogen . A healthy balance of predators and prey diminishes the need for heavy-duty chemical controls . At the same time , a new generation of building materials-such as wood made from recycled plastic and simulated boulders that look like the real thing-helps gardeners create the look of wild habitats while leaving actual wild habitats intact . NATURAL GARDENS ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE REGION . Because plants are adapted to the climate , the soil , the sun or shade , and other characteristics of the site , they thrive without heavy-handed care . NATURAL GARDENS TEACH US . TO plant with the cycle of seasons . To appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dewy morning or the incredible industry of countless little creatures that make their homes among the leaves . To savor the play of the moonlight over silvery leaves and snowy-hued flowers , or the reflection of light and clouds on a pond . But perhaps the most important lesson of all is this : Working with nature teaches us to recognize that every living thing in the garden  --  every plant , animal , bird , insect , moth , and worm-is connected , part of an intricate web of life with a builtin system of checks and balances designed to keep our gardens , the land , and ultimately ourselves , healthy .

Sidebar Four steps to a natural garden Sidebar MATCH THE PLANTS TO YOUR SITE In Colorado , Utah , and other mountain states , unpredictable weather , wide temperature swings , and unexpected frosts at both ends of the growing season practically dictate the use of hardy perennials , evergreen conifers , and tough deciduous trees and shrubs . Constant winds in the plains of Montana and Wyoming call for windbreaks and shade trees such as hackberries and cottonwoods , for well-adapted shrubs such as lilacs and smoke tree , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where hail is a problem , gardeners favor small-leafed plants ; where winters are dry and snow cover light , they compensate with mulch and extra water . Scree landscapes often leave room only for small , jewel-like alpine plants . Sun and shade , bogs and dry washes , slopes and valleys-all present different challenges . But choose the right plants and they will grow lustily . Sidebar PLANT IN LAYERS To replicate natural plant communities , plant in layers , tall to low-tree canopy to perennials to ground covers . Trees and shrubs provide a sense of enclosure . Beneath them , plant low-growers in drifts or meadows , not rows . Treat your plants like free spirits . Let them roam , ramble , and sprawl as nature intended , rather than making them grow up pinched or sheared , squeezed or cinched . If a plant 's habit is naturally stiff and upright ( conifers , for instance ) , place it to show off its sculptural qualities , to capture backlighting from the sun and uplighting from Sidebar lamps , or to cast shadows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden with a lawn and sheared shrubs is of little interest to birds , beneficial insects , and a host of other creatures that keep insect pests in check . But a diverse planting , where nectar and seed producers grow among shelter plants , is wildlife heaven . Backyard wildlife , after all , includes gardeners ' best friends  --  lacewing larvae , which can consume 200 to 400 aphids before adulthood , birds that dine on all manner of garden bugs , and beneficial insects that go after pesty ones . Learn to distinguish the good guys from the bad ones . Sidebar RECYCLE PLANTS AND MATERIALS In nature , the cycle of life and seasons ensures recycling-trees drop leaves that turn to compost . Likewise , a natural garden wastes nothing . Make use of what 's at the site , whether rocks or fallen branches . Manmade materials that would otherwise go to landfills , from concrete chunks to iron gates , can find homes among plants . // <p>                  @ @ @
