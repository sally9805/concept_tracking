GIVEN A CLEAR DAY , Father Tim was hoping to move confession to the Liberty Deck , where penitents could come clean beneath the pure tropical sun . But this Monday , as on the first two days of the Destiny 's voyage , the sky is a sallow mess of cloud , and by lunchtime there 's unrelenting drizzle . After the meal he heads for the chaplain 's office , a revamped supply room by the Pirate 's Cove Casino . <p> A squat , fiftyish woman waits already by the door . Her hair is limp and lusterless-what his mother , who grew up in Wisconsin , would call " sauerkraut hair . " <p> " Pardon me , " she says . " Are you the priest ? " <p> For the cruise Father Tim has ditched his collar , identifying himself only by a blue nametag that says FATHER TIM in cheery sans-serif type and that , he now notices , is camouflaged against his azure guayabera . He points to the tag . " Truth in advertising . " <p> Her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then takes in the whole of him again . He can tell she expects a priest to be older than twenty-seven , with a puffy , underwhelming body and burst-capillary face , not his firmly gym-enhanced physique . The sunglasses probably do n't help , either . He removes them and says , " Step into my office . " <p> The Destiny Daily lists today 's office hour as " confession " - his very first ; he was ordained just last month-but given the holiday atmosphere , and because it 's his twenty-something style , there will be no " Bless me Father , for I have sinned . " In this floating village where every imaginable service has been arranged , Father Tim is the hired shoulder to cry on . <p> The lank-haired woman has apparently gotten a jump-start on the crying . The flesh below her eyes looks like dough that 's risen and been punched down . She sits in one of two canvas director 's chairs-coral-andwhite , the Destiny 's official colors-and Father Tim takes the other . Aside from the chairs , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and a box of Kleenex . The space is sharp with the smell of deodorizer . <p> " My first customer , " he says . " What 's on your mind today ? " <p> The woman crosses and recrosses her arms in what might be an unconscious substitute for his dispensed-with rituals . " I 'm bad , " she says , and he 's about to reassure her that despite our occasional mistakes we are all good , all created in God 's image , when he realizes what she really said was , " I 'm Babs . " <p> " Nice to meet you , Babs . How 's the cruise so far ? You here on your own or with someone ? " <p> " My husband , Les , " she says . " It 's our twenty-fifth anniversary . The Renewal of Vows Package . " <p> " Aha ! You know I 'll be officiating at the ceremony on Friday . " Babs stares at her ragged fingernails . She gnaws a cuticle already clotted with blood . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversational water . " They spoiling you rotten ? " <p> Babs does n't answer ; the silence tightens . Through the thin wall between them and the casino , he can hear clicking poker chips , the whir of balls in roulette wheels . <p> " Oh , it 's just perfect , " she says at last in a scraped-thin voice . " It 's all just so perfect . His-and-hers bathrobes , fresh orchids every morning . Today , breakfast in bed-took one bite and threw up . " <p> " You 're having trouble with Les ? " he surmises . A single tear forms at the lip of Bab 's eyelid . He plucks a Kleenex and presses it in her hand . " It 's all right , " he says . " We all hit rough patches . " But he 's never faced marital troubles-and now , of course , never will . <p> Babs blots the tear from her wan , doughy cheek . She tells him about Les , who 's in crop insurance back in Kansas , specializing in hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , a solid father . And if he 's no Harrison Ford , well , she loves him anyway . She 's come to count on his Bud belly and his droopy ears the way you get fond of a tumbledown house , how the pantry floor does n't quite level with the kitchen . <p> " But I 've never felt , " she says , " you know " - her voice downshifts to a whisper- " the way you 're supposed to . That way . " <p> That way , thinks Father Tim . How do any of us know how " supposed to " feels ? It 's why for so long he failed to recognize his own faith . <p> " You have spousal relations ? " he asks . <p> " Sure , " she says , her forehead pinking till it clashes with the chairs . <p> " I mean , sometimes . Once a month ? I hardly want to . " <p> " You must have something going for you . You 're here , are n't you ? Twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . He lays the box of tissues in her lap . <p> " I 've always known something was missing , " she says , " but I would n't let myself see just what . The kids kept me busy . Now they 're gone , Jenna to K-State and last year Kyle to Notre Dame , and the empty feeling 's back , even worse-like no matter where I go , what 's really happening is happening somewhere else . My mother always said that perfect is the enemy of good , and I 'm sure I do n't need perfect . I just never reckoned good would feel so bad . " <p> He wants to pat her shoulder , but these days boundaries call for overcaution ; he 's been trained , when it 's one on one , not to touch . <p> " With the kids away , " she continues , " I got e-mail so we could keep <p> tabs . As long as it was there , why not have some fun ? I joined an online bridge tournament . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in hot , hushed , rapturous shame . Denise is from Salina . Tall and blond . They 've gotten together a dozen times , when Les is inspecting crops . They 've talked and hugged . They 've kissed , but nothing more . " When I 'm with her , " Babs says , " I feel like I 've finally gotten there . We 're the center . Everyone else is just the fringe . " <p> Father Tim is shocked , unnerved . But can he condemn her thrill in a change he too has felt ? She 's just described-better than he 's ever managed to-the centripetal force of opening himself to God , when suddenly he started living at life 's hub . The crush of it : turmoil and romance . <p> But his crush was God ; hers is a woman . He looks hard at her and asks , " Does Les know ? " <p> " He suspects something , but he 'd never guess what . " Babs 's hair has now fallen across her eyes-drooping , damaged hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's wrong , " she blurts . " I know it 's wrong . " <p> He ca n't tell if she wants him to absolve her or to say , " Yes , it 's a sin and you must stop . " <p> " Marriage is a sacred commitment , " he begins . " A commitment to Les and to God . " It comes out hesitant and tinny , first notes from a borrowed instrument . " But you also have a commitment to yourself . How can you honor God 's truth if your own life is false ? " That 's closer , almost his normal voice . " The key , " he says , " is telling what feels true from what is . " <p> A cheer is audible from the casino , then a faint metallic jackpot clang-someone else 's luck , distant and muted . Father Tim looks into <p> Babs 's runny eyes and sees in them , blurry and reduced , himself . He asks , " Do you feel like renewing your vows would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like jumping overboard . " <p> After she 's gone , Father Tim waits out the rest of the hour . He wants to keep the door open so other visitors will know he 's available , but like all the Destiny 's doors , this one shuts itself with coffin-lid finality . He pulls his chair to the threshold and makes himself a human doorstop . <p> He 's stiff with frustration . What else could he have done for Babs ? Told her to pray , to recite the rosary ? All he provided was a minute more of clunky advice and the promise that she could come to him again . <p> He listens to ukuleles tinkling from a lower deck , the kind of music that might accompany a limbo contest . ( On this ship , it probably does . ) A month ago at the Catholic Games , the tongue-in-cheek seminary Olympiad , he placed second in the Don't-get-stuck-in-Limbo event . Already , he sorely misses St. Thomas : the expectancy , the joyful striving . That was all just preparation for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed the long rehearsal better than he enjoys the show itself ? <p> The hour passes without another caller . People take cruises , he figures , to indulge in fresh sins , not generally to reconcile those past . He replaces his chair , debating whether to head directly to his cabin or to hit the spa for some ionotherapy . <p> The door slams behind him , and his still-full stomach lurches as though a wave has broadsided the ship . He 's steadying himself when someone calls his name . <p> " Tim ? " she says again . " It is you ! " <p> He turns to face a woman in a Destiny uniform , eyes hidden behind mirrored shades but a mile of leg exposed . Her skin is tanned to the hue of his creme brulee from lunch . <p> " Do n't you recognize me ? " She whips off the glasses , shakes her hair free from a coral baseball cap . <p> When he sees all of her , his gut lurches again . " Alison , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the same beauty he remembers : catlike , all arches and grace . But gone is the college girl 's lookaway expression , replaced by a disarming , full-bore stare . " It 's so good , " he says , forgetting to add " to see you . " " Are you here for " - he gestures to the supply room/ chaplain 's office . " Something you want to confess ? " <p> She looks at him perplexedly , then at the door , then back at him . " You are n't ? Oh my gosh , you really are . " She taps his nametag and hoots . <p> " Father Tim ! No , Father , I have nothing to confess . I mean , other than what you already know . " <p> " Then what are you- " <p> She points at her uniform . " Shore Excursion Manager . But right now I 'm on my way to the goombay drumming show . It 's fun . Come on , we 'll have a blast . " <p> And so he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ? was the first thing Tim wondered when he opened his last semester 's grades . The seminary had a deal with Sun Line Cruises , filling one slot each year in the chaplaincy rotation . The cushy Caribbean stint went to the St. Thomas M.Div. with the highest marks in his class ; Tim 's final set of A 's clinched the spot . <p> He knew the week at sea would n't be a totally free ride . But he thought of old Love Boat episodes in which kindly Doc , the shipboard physician , dispensed Band-Aids and an occasional aspirin , but mostly socialized and lived the good life . Tim imagined himself on the Destiny as a similarly carefree doctor of the soul , applying spiritual Mercurochrome : Say two Hail Marys and meet me at shuffleboard . <p> Comparing himself to a television personality was n't especially farfetched ; strangers did it to him all the time . " You 're that guy from CNN , " they would guess , stopping him on the street ; or , leaning across his booth in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy who kissed Ally McBeal in the Christmas episode ? " He had a best-supporting-actor sort of handsomeness , softened by just enough imperfection that people felt they could approach him , but that doing so was a privilege . The dimple between his eyebrows gave him an affect of compassionate concern . A chronic crick made him tilt his neck unconsciously to the left so he always seemed to be listening for trouble . <p> Already in his priestly practice roles-deaconing , counseling at the homeless shelter-Tim had seen how good looks worked to his advantage . Other seminarians , with their frail figures and acne-scarred chins , gave off a eunuchy air of hopelessness ; people pitied them , discounted their advice . But Tim 's virile eyes and veiny forearms won the attention of even the most agnostic . For him , they assumed , the priesthood was not a fallback but a choice . And if tse church 's message was compelling enough to win this hunky man , maybe they too should listen up . <p> Tim 's turn to the church was unexpected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been one , and that trumped his mother 's lapsed Lutheranism , despite-or perhaps because of-his father 's absconding when Tim was six . But without his father to impart its rituals , Tim 's Catholicism lived in him as a palpable absence , like the whiff of incense that haunts a room long after the stick is snuffed . <p> At eighteen he chose Boston College , not for its Jesuit tradition but because they offered the best scholarship . He enrolled in the School of Management , intending to manage his way into the upper class . He was not ashamed of his family 's poverty , but it wearied him . Almost every 1:00 A.M. of his childhood he 'd been woken by his mother 's return from moonlight waitressing , her car door 's slam the very sound of her prospects being shut . She 'd been caught unprepared when her husband walked away , too reliant on her faith in love alone . <p> He breezed through first semester , acing Statistics and Intro to Accounting , although the courses , like most everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least wanted to be liked by them , investing in their attention as if purchasing futures in social standing . He was asked to pose for the " Men of Boston College " calendar , and he agreed because the photographer let him keep a varsity wardrobe Tim could never have afforded . He strode across campus with ground-gulping strides , dressed in the clothes of a man he thought he longed to be . <p> In his second year he met Alison , the star shortstop of BC 's softball team . She was pixyish and lean and looked finely bruisable , but there was infield dirt beneath her fingernails . He got a kick from her alertness , the way she charged into conversations as if each comment were a doubleplay ball to be nabbed . Their sex was all hustle , headfirst . <p> For spring break , Alison was joining an immersion service project : ten days at an El Salvador orphanage . Tim signed up , too , wanting to prove himself worthy of her affections . Maybe her faith in him would boost his faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside each other and squeezed hands during gut-drop turbulence . <p> The orphanage director was Padre Jose , a priest who , with his unflinching stare and hydrant-thick neck , would have made a convincing fireman , someone whose net you would happily plunge into . In fervent English he explained his mission 's method : The orphanage was a construction work-in-progress , continuously refurbished by the boys ; they worked hard-framing walls , laying pipe , tiling roofs-and as they built their home , he built them into men . These were boys who had never felt secure , the priest said , so they lacked the right emotional infrastructure . He was teaching them love from the ground up . " After all , Jesus was a carpenter ) God the Father ' is not merely a metaphor to these boys . The Church becomes their home , their family . " <p> The speech struck Tim with the trenchancy of an aphorism , . timeless and incontestable . Afterward , Alison wanted to explore the town 's cafes , but Tim said he 'd look for her later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharing philosophy and rum . <p> In the morning they excavated a new foundation hole for a bedroom to house the youngest boys . Tim 's palms blistered , but he did n't mind the pain . When the shovel hit a rock it hummed like a tuning fork , and Tim 's body , too , reverberated . With every shovelful he dug out for the orphanage foundation , he felt his own hollowness filling up . <p> That Sunday , in Padre Josh 's whitewashed church , Tim received his first communion in years . When the priest asked the congregation to join hands in a prayer of peace , Tim gripped the clay-caked fingers of two orphans . The comfort was comparable to holding hands with Alison , but deeper , an anchoring . <p> Back at school , he began attending mass every week , then every day . BC 's Gothic towers and golden-eagle bust-once emblems of all he wanted to achieve-now seemed flimsy backdrops to a much more urgent drama . He 'd always been skeptical of see-the-light accounts . This was n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering revelation , no bolts from on high , but an unforeseen inevitability . Before , he had felt like a river 's fickle current ; now he felt like the riverbed . He woke each day with a trembling heart , as if in love . <p> It was softball season ; when he tried to explain himself to Alison , she had her game face on . They stopped assuming they would spend weekends together . The spare toothbrush in his bathroom went unused . On Easter Monday , through his soft tears and Alison 's sharp silence , Tim officially broke things off . <p> In May , during finals , he got an e-mail . " I 've been thinking of you , " wrote Padre Jose . " That look in your eyes when you hugged the boys good-bye . You have so much to give . Will you let yourself ? " <p> Tim heeded the tug of providence . He withdrew from the School of Management and transferred to St. Thomas . His classmates could n't fathom the switch . Did he realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a father-could disappear ; the need to serve would always remain . <p> The day he moved he saw Alison at the campus bookstore , trading in her used texts for petty cash . She was dating the ace reliever on the baseball team , she boasted , but her smile was so tight it must have hurt . <p> Father Tim scans the Jolly Roger Room . He 's four minutes early for their nightcap . This afternoon , as they were . sitting down for the goombay drumming show , Alison was summoned by her office-some problem scheduling a parasailing trip . She proposed this late-night drink as a rain date . <p> The Jolly Roger Room is where , in the morning , Father Tim celebrates mass . At that hour , with its velveteen hush and suggestive dimness , the space is not altogether unchurchly ; crowded now with brandy breathed revelers , its decor strikes him as " bordello lite . " The looseness is too forced to ring true , like a businessman 's bluejeans with ironed creases . <p> On a table just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oddly jaundiced , the sculpture looks familiar . He 's puzzling over the resemblance when a thin , goateed man presents himself . Visitors to the Jolly Roger Room , he explains , have their photos taken and dumped into a bowl . Each day he selects one snapshot randomly and carves a corresponding " Butter Bust . " <p> Catchy , Father Tim acknowledges-he saw something similar at the Wisconsin State Fair-but he tells the man no thanks , not for him . " Oh , you must , " the artist insists , aiming a Polaroid before he can duck away . <p> At the front of the lounge , bathed in black light that makes their teeth fluoresce , Kip 's Kalypso Kings libidinously perform . Kip , a jowly , ash-skinned man who , according to his bio on the drinks menu , once sang backup for Jimmy Buffett , croons " Day-O " as if it were a love song . Father Tim taps his foot but resists humming along . He decides to leave and walk the deck for a minute , hoping Alison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hand on his waist halts him . <p> " Hey , Father , " says Alison in the same cozy tone she used back in college for " Hey , Twinkle . " ( " Hey , Star , " he 'd respond , and kiss her nose . ) <p> " Hi there , " he says , winking . " Come here often ? " <p> She leads him to a booth at the side . Where she touched him he feels a phantom grip . <p> Alison orders a strawberry margarita . When Father Tim asks for Glenlivet on the rocks , she arches a roguish eyebrow . <p> " What 'd you expect ? " he says . " A Virgin Mary ? " <p> " I 'm just surprised you 'd spring for the good stuff , is all . You were always a well-drink kind of guy . " <p> He likes how they 've slipped back to their old repartee . It 's all the more enjoyable now for being safer , their boundaries defined , so that neither one is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Really great . " <p> " You 're the one who 's buffed and polished . " She squeezes him hard on the biceps . " Father What-a-Waste . ' That 's what my mom always called guys like you . Who 'd have guessed that Mr. Men of BC Calendar ' would wind up a priest ? " <p> Father Tim has told himself that everybody needs to start from somewhere-St . Paul first had to be Saul . He says , " That was a long time ago . " <p> Alison plays with the parasol that came with her margarita , the same magenta as her fingernails . <p> She never used to paint her nails , he thinks . " Tell me , " he says , " how 'd you end up here ? " <p> She fills him in on the missing years : a softball-coaching stint at a prep school in Rhode Island , then back to Boston , a Back Bay PR firm . " A real job , you know ? Put the communications degree to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a desk , writing press releases and faxing them to who knows . " She swigs an antidote of margarita . " I 'd always dreamed of taking a cruise , so when I quit , it 's the first thing I did . I liked it so much , I made them hire me ! Oh , do n't look so shocked . Not like you never had a quick conversion . " <p> " If you know what you want , " he says , " great . " <p> " I 'm not going to do this forever . But for now ? I could n't be happier . " <p> The Jolly Roger Room has filled to capacity . At the next table a portly black man and his Japanese lady-friend sip from a scorpion bowl with two Crazy Straws . Behind them sit an older , lei-wearing white pair , feeding each other calamari . The Kalypso Kings warble " I Want to Hold Your Hand . " The couples moon at one another and sway along . <p> Father Tim feels the space between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fluctuating air pressure . It 's been months since his last private , non-church conversation with a woman . <p> " What about you ? " she asks . " When you transferred , I was sure it was just a phase . " <p> He shrugs . " If it 's a phase , it 's a pretty long one . " <p> " I just wondered . " She twirls her mini-parasol , then sucks its wet stem . " Was I that bad in bed ? To make you swear it off for good ? " <p> " It 's always the celibacy ! Give me a break . " Seeing her chastened face , he softens . " But no , not any fault of yours . Trust me . " In fact , he remembers her expertise vividly . And more than that , just her presence , her jazz . In these cloistered years he 's held tight to certain images : Alison head-sliding into home to beat a throw , a crescent moon of belly visible ; in El Salvador , Alison gobbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She takes his fingertips , a slight but ardent touch . " Can you try to explain ? Why did you do it ? " <p> How do you explain why even the blind know how to smile ? Why whistling and laughter are contagious ? " I know it looked sudden . But I 'd always felt sort of off course . After that service project , it was like somebody turned the map around , like I 'd always been reading it upside down . Boom , there was that arrow : YOU ARE HERE . The Church is where I am . God is where . " <p> As though buffing a gem to determine if it 's real , she rubs at the knuckle of his thumb . " I believe in God , too , " she says . <p> " But I want to serve Him . To make a difference . To help others feel that same groundedness . " He envisions Babs 's blotchy , frightened face . <p> " Ca n't you do that without , " Alison says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still stuck on sex . " <p> " No , it 's just .. . OK , maybe I am . How can you live without being sexual ? " <p> " I am . Everybody is . That does n't mean I have to express it genitally . " He hears how clinical that sounds and cringes , tries again : " Ally , to be human is to be finite . By choosing one thing , we always give up something else . " <p> " Are n't you scared of being lonely ? What about marriage ? " <p> " Sure , that solves everything-just ask my mother ! " <p> " So the answer 's just to run away from it ? " <p> He braces himself with a sip of scotch . " Most people get married for the wrong reasons , " he tells her , repeating something his rector once told him . " Or incomplete reasons . Naive ones . But eventually they grow into it , and it 's right . Maybe choosing celibacy is the same . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes they decline a second round . The neighboring couple-the hefty black man and his fine-boned companion-punch and slap at each other 's shoulders . It 's a mock argument , a tipsy mating display , but Father Tim senses underlying tension . <p> " The funny thing .. . " Alison says . She has twisted her swizzle stick into a crooked helix , and stares at it as if it might reveal her future . " I kind of thought that you and I would marry . " <p> " Ally , we dated less than a year . " <p> " I know , but I just had a feeling . Nobody else ever seemed so right . " A hot burst of something erupts in his chest , on the edge between soothing and unpleasant . He 's swallowed too much scotch , or not enough . He asks , " What happened to what's-his-name , with the curveball ? " <p> " Topher ? Uch , was that a bad rebound . The guy kissed like he was spitting tobacco . He shipped off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> They laugh at Topher 's expense , and at the distance of their past . Father Tim fills with startling relief . <p> In the morning he returns to the Jolly Roger Room for mass . Some dozen cruisegoers are in attendance . There 's a couple in matching canary jogging suits who bicker about the husband 's need for a shave . Next to them rests a raisin-faced , copper-haired grandmother with her grandson , a drowsy teen in shorts . <p> Father Tim officiates from a table with a napkin wedged under one of its legs for balance . Wearing full vestments before this holiday congregation , he feels uncomfortably overdressed , a tuxedoed judge at a swim-suit competition . ( Earlier , he found the . previous chaplain 's note : " If you get too hot , the a/c control 's behind the bar-chasubles were n't designed for the tropics ! " ) <p> Halfway through his homily something shifts , a change more of subtraction than addition , as when a blaring car alarm finally stops . He sees the effect on the worshippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd like to think they 're transformed by his words , or the comfort of the Holy Spirit , but what they 're feeling is that the Destiny has docked . <p> Thankful himself to be at this solid mooring , he ministers communion to the bickering couple , to the woman with the penny-colored hair . He 's placing the Host on the palm of her yawning grandson when he sees Babs at the back of the room . She slinks in , accompanied by a man with a corn-stubble crewcut and a plow blade of a jaw . Father Tim beckons them , but they hang back , looking away , as if respecting the privacy of someone scantily clad . <p> Only when mass is done do they approach . " Sorry we missed it , " says Babs . " This is my husband , Les . " <p> She looks better than she did the day before , her face less puffy , her hair not quite so moribund on her shoulders , but in her voice he hears the chronic misery . <p> Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My fault , " he says . " Hate to be late . But I could n't for the life of me find my sunglasses . Babs says I 've got Sometimer 's Disease-like Alzheimer 's but less predictable . Ha ha ! " He laughs as if reading aloud from a cartoon bubble . <p> " Funny , " says Babs . " The Sometimer 's almost always hits just as we 're on our way to church . " <p> " Oh , now , " says Les . He takes her hand and pets it with habitual tenderness . " You heading ashore today , Father ? " <p> The priest removes his stole . " Had n't planned on it . " <p> " Come with us . I predict it 'll clear up this afternoon . " <p> " I do n't know , " says Father Tim . Last night , Alison mentioned Ocho Rios as her favorite port of call , but he decided just to stay on board , maybe work out in the Buried Treasure Gym . He 's found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spends most of the time alone in his cabin , reading . He can see himself turning into his mother , who always orders the cheapest dish in a restaurant , even when she 's being treated , because if she does n't get used to pampering then she can never miss it . <p> " You could n't skip Ocho Rios , " Babs says . Her eyes look fragile , pleading . <p> " They 've got it all planned out , " Les adds . " A tour of some old plantation . A fish-fry lunch . " <p> It 's not the world 's most convincing pitch . Father Tim wonders how much insurance Les hawks . But he thinks of Alison 's enthusiasm , the giddy way she said " Shore Excursion Manager . " <p> Alison stands at the gangway , clipboard in hand , looking necessary and ornamental all at once . Her tan is such a contrast to her uniform whites that she appears enhanced , a colorized image . Last night , across from her in the lounge , Father Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils fill with the same cut-open scent . <p> " Too late to sign up ? " he asks . <p> " For you ? I think we can find a slot . " <p> " Good . I 've got my camera and my tacky shirt and my overflowing wallet . Do I look like Touristicus americanus ? " <p> " Yeah . What happened to the vow of poverty ? " <p> " Does n't apply to parish priests , " he says . He sidles up to her . <p> " Ready to manage my excursion ? " <p> " You betcha . I 'm going to manage you right on over to Andrew " she points to a redheaded , Canadian Mountie-looking fellow- " who 'll be leading your group to shore . " <p> " You 're not coming ? " <p> " I 'm too high and mighty now . Got to hold down the fort . " <p> Father Tim adjusts the camera 's weight around his neck . The sun . screen on his brow is unpleasantly gummy . Maybe he should bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercively on his shoulder . " Fun and sun , here we come ! " says Les . Beside him stands Babs , quietly wincing . Her eyes are red and watery again . <p> Andrew , the rangy tour guide , blows a whistle . <p> " Guess we 're out of here , " says Father Tim to Alison . " But maybe we can find time later . Dinner ? " <p> She frowns . " Sorry , no can do . Booked . " <p> " Maybe tomorrow ? " <p> " I 've got a staff meeting , but how about another nightcap ? Same time and channel as last night ? " <p> " Sure , " he says . " Sure . It 's a date . " <p> At the pier a gold-toothed man , his face tiny within a tangle of dreadlocks , pushes Rasta caps and balsa carvings . Andrew warned of these often shady " higglers , " so Babs marches stonily on , ignoring his continued list of wares . " Mahogany ? Black coral ? Batik ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , stops to answer his soulbrother handshake . <p> " Come on , " calls Babs . " We 'll be late for the tour . " <p> Les is inspecting a tortoiseshell comb . " Nice ? Maybe to bring back for Jenna ? " <p> " Les , that stuff 's illegal . Protected species , Andrew said . Right , Father ? " <p> The priest , trying not to get caught in the middle , says flatly , " It might be a risk at customs . " <p> The Rastafarian hides the comb back in his bag , then fingers Babs 's sauerkraut locks . " How ' bout da woman 's hair-she wan ' me braid it ? " <p> Les claps his hands . " Fun ! Like a real Jamaican . " <p> " No , " Babs says , ducking away . <p> " Come on , hon. Live a little . It would look pretty . " <p> " No , " she repeats , and strides off , leaving the men to chase behind . " Do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sticks a pinkie into his ear and wiggles it as if trying to pick the lock of his own thoughts . " Do you suppose it could be the change of life ? " <p> Seeing Les 's lunkish , unwitting expression , Father Tim is awash with the awful helplessness of watching a sparrow fly into glass . How could two people live together for a quarter-century and still know so little about each other ? " Have you tried to talk to her ? " he suggests . <p> " She 's not much of one for talking . She 'd rather sit alone , fooling on her internet . " <p> Father Tim looks ahead to Babs 's trudging form , her fallen-soufflE bottom within lime Bermuda shorts , and tries to imagine her with Denise . " I 'd be happy to facilitate , " he offers . <p> Les waves him off . " We 'll work it out . Always have . That 's why we 're married . " <p> They catch Babs and reconnoiter with the cruise-ship group . Andrew-who , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to fund grad school in social work-brings them to Good Hope Plantation . They learn about the life cycle of the banana plant , the proper way to carry a load of coconuts in a head basket . The morning is gray and close , the humidity so thick that Father Tim perceives it as a ringing in his skull . <p> Then it 's on to a nearby waterfall-popular , Andrew informs them , as a marriage-proposal spot . This prompts a round of storytelling as each couple recounts where they popped the question . Two newlyweds , by the sound of them Brooklynites , describe the thrill of saying yes on the Coney Island Cyclone , just as the roller coaster plunged . The pair from this morning 's mass , in the canary jogging suits , quibble over the site of their engagement : " Depends , " says the man . " First or second time ? " Babs and Les do n't volunteer their story , but Father Tim watches a shadow of private memory pass between them . The waterfall is an intricate liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its exuberant noise - an endless yes - he hears the Brooklyn wife bidding for his attention : " ... favor ... just married ... you would n't mind ? " She plants a sleek black Leica in his hand . <p> " My pleasure , " he says . " There , against the falls ? " The couple pose in the self-evident spot , by a mist-brightened , heart-shaped outcropping , and Father Tim captures the shot . It 's an image , he realizes , that must reside in a thousand honeymoon albums . But is n't that exactly the point , linking yourselves to a vast married chain ? At last you 've joined the club . You 're in . <p> The jogging-suit duo finally agree on something : They want a snapshot , too . " Us next ? " says the man , more a statement than a question , as he foists his Nikon on Father Tim . The priest focuses , frames the shot ; the shutter clicks . <p> All turn to the last pair , Babs and Les . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands in purling water . She dunks her fingers as if they 're something to be drowned . <p> Respectfully , the others avert their eyes . But Les , belly jiggling , hams it up . " My wife , " he announces , so loud that everyone is forced to hear , " is part Cherokee , her father 's mother 's side . She 's scared a picture is going to steal her soul . " As if his Instamatic is a savage jungle beast , he thrusts it at her , growling extravagantly . <p> Babs glares . " I am no such thing , " she says . <p> " Oh yeah ? If you 're not Indian , what are you then ? " She shakes her hands dry . " Nothing . And you know it . " " Not to me , " he says . " You 're everything . You 're mine . " <p> Babs startles , then shyly blinks her eyes . Her firm frown warps into a smile . " Oh , quit fussing , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father Tim accepts the camera from Les and snaps a photo ; then , just in case , he snaps another . <p> The man from Brooklyn jokes that if church life gets too slow , the priest could always go into business . " A sideline , " he says . " Heavenly Photos . " <p> Father Tim 's own camera remains around his neck . Nobody offers to take his picture . <p> Lunch is at a grubbily authentic corrugated tin shack back in town . They 're fed goat stew , fried dolphin , and salt-cod pancakes that the cook calls " stamp-and-go . " Everyone guzzles Ting , a local grapefruit soda that Father Tim decides , as it trills down his throat , achieves a kind of gustatory onomatopoeia . <p> He remembers something he 's meant to tell Alison : a hole-in-thewall Salvadoran lunch shop he discovered in East Boston , where the pupusas are the true criolla thing . He 'd love to take her there , for old times ' sake . He 's forgotten to ask where she 's based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Boston ? Where would she stay ? <p> Just as dessert is served , the clouds that have dogged the entire voyage peel away , like bandages stripped to bare renewed skin . Andrew announces that the group will split up for the afternoon . There are glass-bottom boat trips , catamarans , horseback tours . Just be back on ship by five o'clock , he warns . <p> Father Tim approaches Babs and Les . This past while , husband and wife have n't said much to each other , but they no longer appear to be consciously not speaking . Les has a boat-shaped piece of papaya , Babs a plate of sliced sweetsop . In the unconscious balletic movements of a long-established couple , they trade bites of the juice-dripping fruit . " Remember Marty ? " she says . <p> " Sure , " says Les , " that time in Hutchinson . " <p> " When he swallowed- " <p> " And his face- " " Porcupine ) " <p> Father Tim stops short and clears his throat . Les turns . " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> " You sure did . I thought some snorkeling might be in order to celebrate . " <p> " Sounds fun , " says Les . " But we already settled on one of those paddleboats . Take a couple of Red Stripes and drift around the bay . " " Absolutely . That could definitely work , too . " <p> Les and Babs exchange a low-lidded glance . Babs chews on a last piece of papaya . " The paddleboats only have two seats , " she says . " Oh , " says Father Tim . " Of course . I was n't thinking . " <p> By now the others have all gone , so he makes his way alone to the beach . Lovers splash in the surf , and families play along the shore , using coconut shells to shape sandcastle domes . The sun stings like the aftermath of a slap . <p> He strips off his shirt . His last trip to the beach , a weekend getaway to Plum Island with his classmates , they took turns rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one to help him , his skin will surely burn . He replaces the shirt and retreats to the ship . <p> The next day they dock at Grand Cayman . Father Tim worries that Les might propose another excursion , but thankfully he and Babs do n't show at mass . He wonders what this bodes for their marriage ; they could be sleeping late together , or not speaking again . <p> Returning to his cabin he takes a longcut past the gangway . Alison is snared in an argument with an underchinned , stumpy man who insists his travel agent touted Grand Cayman 's Mayan ruins . <p> " Could she have said Tulum ? " Alison suggests . " Near Cozumel ? " <p> " Not It 's Cayman . She definitely said Grand Cayman . " <p> Father Tim flashes a sympathetic smile , but she misses it . <p> He spends the morning secluded in his cabin . Sprawled on the vast bed with his complete Flannery O'Connor , he tries to pick up where he left off in Wise Blood . After reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration shot by the awareness of all the reputed fun he 's missing . He could be tracing figure eights at the ice-skating rink , or sink- , ing putts on the nine-hole green . There 's the rock-climbing wall , the : Virtual Reality Center with its " motion-based undersea theme rides . " If he were home it would be the height of decadence to read in bed in the middle of the day , but in this temple of pleasure , where even the lowliest deck-swabbers seem ecstatic in their swabbing , anything less than the time of his life feels like failure . <p> At last he rouses himself for a stroll . For the first time in days he 's feeling queasy , so he sticks a motion-sickness patch behind his ear . The nausea confounds him : the ship is moored ; the weather has calmed . Maybe it was the stamp-and-go . <p> He ascends to the Liberty Deck , where the sun , as if piqued by days of passenger complaints , reigns with vengeful , **26;1740;TOOLONG strength . There are no clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe there ever might be again . With the heat , and so many passengers ashore , the Destiny is eerily deserted . Dozens of empty deck chairs face the sea in bleak rows , a graveyard for a boatload of drowned tourists . <p> His stomach flares , but it 's not a seasick sloshing ; it 's the arid , barren clench of solitude-much worse than yesterday at the beach . Are n't you scared ? asked Alison . How can you live ? The " discipline of celibacy , " when they parsed it at St. Thomas , was not a white-knuckled act of selfdenial but a choice , a more inclusive way of loving . Now he unsheathes the phrase and pricks with a different edge : Celibacy is a punishment . <p> At St. Thomas , he could manage his longings . He fought pangs of desire and isolation , but did n't everyone ? Even married folks ? The potholes in his chosen walk were pretty well patched by camaraderie . Three times a day he broke bread , and three times a day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; having one soulmate did n't seem so necessary . How could he not have guessed the loneliness that would vise him once he was ordained and on his own ? <p> Clutching the railing , he stares past the port of Grand Cayman , into the nevermore distance , where sea and sky disorientingly merge . His grief is anchorless , unclosable , as for a loved one lost at sea , no corpse to bury . <p> He spies the sculptor a half-second too late to pretend he has n't . " Oh , good I " calls the artist , who grabs him by the elbow and detains <p> him at the Jolly Roger Room 's entrance . " I hoped you would come tonight . Look ! " With a flourish he whisks away an invisible curtain to reveal tonight 's buttery creation . It 's Father Tim-the unconsciously canted neck , the dimpled brow-caught in a look of grudging submission . <p> The artist , smiling , asks , " Are you happy ? " <p> For a moment Father Tim is too stunned to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendition is so accurately cheerless . " Yes , " he says . " You 're very talented . " He pushes into the bar and picks the table where two nights prior he and Alison chatted . Same time , same channel , she said . The Kalypso Kings break into " Day-O " right on cue , the ten o'clock bell . Even Kip 's gestures are identical . Maybe he 's not real but animatronic . <p> The waitress asks if she can bring the priest a drink , but he says no , he 'll hold out for his guest . He rearranges a stack of cocktail napkins in a pointless solitaire . The first time he had to wait for Alison was after their inaugural bout of sex . He lay in her undone bed , ceding her the five minutes of bathroom privacy she requested-their first separation since meeting that afternoon . He slipped his hips into the hollow in the mattress made by hers . He inhaled the sweet , mossy smell of her sheets . Five minutes was unthinkable ! He burst in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How easy this is , he remembers thinking , how astonishingly effortless and alive . But was that , over time , the difficulty ? Growing up with his left-behind mother , Tim had come to think of love as untrustable , a mirage . Now he wonders if his and Alison 's was real . In their molten almost-year together they fused a shape that was neither of them , yet both-a being that kept no secrets from itself . He told her about the sucker punch of his father 's disappearance , about his drive to feel needed so as never to feel needy . He cried in her cradling arms . <p> He wants that again , that heat and hope . He wants to confide in her , to confess his qualms about being the one to whom others now confess , his panic at the thought of life alone . He burns to lie with her-not for the physical release but for the stitched-togetherness , the gut cramp that says five minutes is too long to be apart . <p> When the waitress returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Tim orders a Diet Coke . Her staff meeting must have run late , he thinks . Maybe a foul-up with the Cozumel logistics . <p> At ten-thirty he requests a double scotch . He asks the waitress to ask the barman if anyone 's left a message . She returns with the drink and with a shrug . <p> Jowls wattling , Kip sings , " I feel so break up , I wan na go home . " He finishes the tune , then belches some mock-piratical innuendo about the prowess of his restless " Jolly Roger . " How many nights has he slung the same old jokes ? What life did the young Kip once dream of ? <p> The crowd has thinned , leaving only a half-dozen elderly couples holding arthritic , familiar hands , and at the front a younger pair who , despite the music 's lull , still rock to a steady private beat . <p> At five past eleven , another two scotches downed , but not so much drunk as saturated , Father Tim signs his tab and stands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display table , and as he passes he ca n't help but see his likeness melted to a sallow , vacant blur . <p> Thursday 's weather is touch-and-go , no rain yet but a sky the bleary milk-blue shade of a bum eye . Father Tim hunkers in the chaplain 's office . He has n't eaten . His hangover hammers him with its claw end , sharp and mean . He went looking for Alison at lunchtime , but according to Sandy , the Cruise Director , she 's gone for the day , scouting sites in Cozumel . <p> To kill time , and because his mind is too mushy for much else , Father Tim has brought along postcards . The first he addresses collectively to St. Thomas , to the teachers and jealous pals he left behind . " Pilgrim 's progress , " he scribbles shakily . " Paradise regained ? Wish you were here . " <p> Then his mother . The card he 's picked for her shows the Destiny in scale against the White House , dwarfing it . Before embarking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign her up for their New Year 's singles ' cruise . Now he tells her how much she would hate it : the wastefulness , the enforced merriment . <p> There 's a faint knock that might be the disgruntled table-slap of a gambler next door . When it sounds again , louder , he realizes he has a visitor . He cracks the door and is met by Les , his face and neck sunburned to the shade of cooked shrimp , but his buzzed scalp a halo of lighter flesh . In his hands he holds a Pioneer seed cap , worrying its brim into a frown . <p> " Hi , Father , " he says . " Disturbing you ? " <p> " Not at all . That 's why I 'm here . " He motions for Les to take a seat . <p> " Case you 're wondering , " Les says , " Babs went ashore . " <p> " You did n't want to see Cozumel too ? " <p> Les crimps his cap more firmly . " We had a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sicked up her food for the third time already on the cruise . He helped her back to their cabin and fizzed some Alka-Seltzer , but she said the trouble was n't her stomach , it was her conscience . She sat down on the big bed , not touching him , not looking . There was someone else . A woman . Denise . <p> " Just like that , " Les says . " Like it was already history , a done deal . A day before our anniversary . " He rubs at his dry , reddened neck . As if confirming the punch line of a joke he does n't get , he turns to the priest and says again , " A woman ? " <p> " I 'm so sorry , " says Father Tim . " You must feel totally blindsided . " Not letting on that he already knows feels like a lie ; his palms get clammy and cold . <p> " Actually , " says Les , " it 's almost a relief . At least now I have an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroding , goes loose . " Oh , Father , " he whispers . " Oh , Father . " <p> To be called upon like this by a man his father 's age-it 's what he 's worked for ; it should be a confirmation . But a sense of inadequacy knocks the wind out of him . <p> " She said I could ask for an annulment , " Les goes on . " That what feels true is sometimes really false . " <p> Father Tim is humbled to hear his own words quoted . " And what did you say to that ? " he asks . <p> Les straightens his back as though taking an oath . " That I would do absolutely no such thing . That she 's my wife and she always will be . " Father Tim stares at this damaged , stalwart man , revising his evalu <p> ation . What struck him initially as stony doltishness he sees now as Less bedrock strength . Here 's a guy who has witnessed the devastation of countless storms , the terrible routineness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief for Les that if properly insured , you can always rebuild . <p> " Listen , " Les says . " I 'm nothing to write home about . I 've never had the looks of some guys . " He gestures to Father Tim 's musculature . " And maybe I ca n't be everything to Babs . But I can be a lot . I already have . We 've put too much into this to scrap it now . " <p> This is when Father Tim should bolster Les . Annulment , he should say , is a drastic , last-ditch measure . They 've got to try everything else first , just as a priest doubting his vocation should explore every path before quitting his vows . <p> Yet he hesitates . He pictures Babs the first day she came to him : her woebegone , boggled look . He recalls how she brightened when she spoke of Denise , the film of sorrow skimmed from her expression . <p> " Father ? " asks Les . " Will you talk to her ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les is gone , Father Tim withdraws to his cabin and pumps a hundred-twenty-something push-ups , until his own weight is unsupportable . He collapses on the floor , his heart skittery and uncertain , a compass needle in a magnetic disturbance . <p> He waits for a call from Alison . And waits . <p> Finally , after dinner , which he fails to attend , he glumly heads out in search of Babs . He checks the spa , the casino , the jolly Roger Room , eyes peeled for Alison as well . On the Indulgence Deck there 's a drum show and a bridge tournament , but neither woman is anywhere to be found . He climbs to the Liberty Deck , ready at last to quit , and wends his way aft toward the railing . In daytime it 's where skeet shooters kill their birds of clay , but now it hosts another sort of fantasizers : sunsetlovers swooning at the sky . <p> This evening the display is washed out and unimpressive , the sun veiled by tight-knotted clouds . The crowd is sparse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprised to find Babs there . He spots her with her chest pressed against the steel railing , breasts spilling down like batter overrunning a pan . <p> " I did it , " she says softly . " I told him . " <p> " I know . I spoke with Les , " he says , deciding it 's all right to reveal that much . " So , how are you now ? How do you feel ? " <p> " I feel . . . " she begins , then reconsiders . " Honestly , not much of anything . Like how food tastes when you 've got a bad cold . " <p> " That 's natural , " he says . " You 're in shock . " <p> " I thought once I told him , he 'd leave me , " she says . " He 's made it tougher . He 's put the choice on me . " <p> Father Tim winces against the stiff sea wind . " Choosing is what makes us human-that we have to , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he tried to convince Alison-and himself-the other day , but now he feels the hairline ache of it in his bones . " If you leave Les , you 'll mourn your old life . If you stay , you 'll mourn the life you might have had . " <p> " That 's just it , " Babs says . " How 're you supposed to weigh two things when one 's on the scale already and the other 's just imagined ? I was thinking , standing here before you showed : I do n't know Denise 's middle name . I do n't even know if she 's got one . " She lets out something between a laugh and a grunt . " Then I think : If I always only stuck with what I know , I never would have married Les to start with . I wouldn't 've had my wonderful kids . You do n't get anywhere without sometimes first you jump . " <p> Father Tim wrestles with what to say . Part of him wants to tell her , Keep going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of happiness . But of course he ca n't openly counsel her to leave and violate the sacrament of marriage . And who 's to say that happiness is what she would find if she leapt blindly to the other side ? " You 're right , " he says , " the more risk , the more reward . But could n't staying put be more risk than running off ? Sometimes it takes guts to stick it out where you are . " <p> Babs coils a hank of dull hair around her fingers ; she twists and twists , but the hair wo n't hold a shape . High above the deck wheels a lone gray gull . She watches it with a look of stupefaction . <p> " If you left Les , " he asks , " what would you miss most ? " <p> " I 'm sick of thinking about who I should be for Les . Or for my kids . <p> Really , even for Denise . I want to be somebody all by myself . " <p> " But nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with God . " <p> He turns and stares at the indistinct horizon , where the low sun still muddies the clouds . The sky 's the color of apple flesh that 's been bruised . <p> Because he 's gazing off , he does n't notice the woman until she 's tapped his shoulder . " Would you mind ? " she says , holding up a camera . Father Tim shoots a bemused glance at Babs , and they both laugh . <p> " Do I look like an easy mark ? " he says . <p> " If it 's a problem , " the woman says . She steps back . <p> " No , no , I 'd be happy . I 've just been asked to take a lot of photos lately . " Father Tim accepts her big-lensed camera . She 's his age , he guesses , give or take a year , and has Alison 's kind of calisthenic poise . She wears her hot-pink halter top with the chesty aplomb of someone who has nothing to hide . Beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and striking features . The older sister , Father Tim decides . " Not much of a sunset , " he says , " but do you want me to get it in the background ? " <p> " Perfect , " the sisters call in unison . <p> When they 've arranged and rearranged themselves properly at the railing , Father Tim begins his count to three . By " two " the women are locked in an all-or-nothing kiss . He swallows " three " but manages to snap the shot . <p> The women keep kissing , then finally disengage , both of them sparkly and flushed . " Thanks , " says the one in pink , reclaiming her camera . " Our one-year anniversary . " They flash matching gold bands on their fingers . <p> Babs stands beside the priest , wordlessly gaping with awe or with horror-he ca n't tell which . Seeing what 's possible is sometimes worse than being blinkered . <p> He smiles at the women and says , " Congratulations . " <p> At midnight , sleepless , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Babs stood . He 's been pacing the cage of his cabin for hours . He needs the touch of unconditioned air . <p> The Destiny is at sail once more , chugging on its long haul home . It will cruise around Cuba 's untouchable western shore and head at last for Fort Lauderdale . He wondered , when awarded this vacation , why a chaplain would be needed on a cruise . Was n't the pampering , the escape , ministry enough ? But he sees it now-how freeing yourself from the trap of your routine can sometimes be its own kind of trap . <p> A sharp moon undermines the privacy of night . The air is fickle with swells of warm and cool . Father Tim turns his face to the sky . He prays . <p> He prays for Babs , that she 'll make the best decision . And for Les , that he wo n't be left behind . That these two prayers might be mutually exclusive is a puzzle he leaves for God to solve . Let there be more love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love not cross or disconnect . <p> But he 's unsure what an answered prayer would be . Does his sturdy priest 's faith-still within him , just as strong-mean he 's always got to live a priest 's life ? Is there room for love of God and someone else ? <p> Then comes the voice . " Hey , Twinkle , " she says . <p> He sees her first not as a woman but a flower , an outsized orchid sprouted from the deck . Sheer and shapely , her evening gown is leafgreen at the legs , and at the bust blooms with violet . " Alison . I did n't hear you coming . " <p> She shrugs and whispers , " I fly stealth . " <p> They stand there a long fifteen seconds , just breathing , watching the ship 's wake diverge . Father Tim hears the blood beat in his ears . Around Alison 's neck hangs a strand of fat pearls ; her dress is cut so the gems flirt with her cleavage . The last time he saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jittery with nerves and with arousal , he pricked his finger pinning on her corsage . <p> " What 's the occasion ? " he asks . <p> " Formal dinner . I was at the captain 's table . " <p> A devil of brine-scented air whirls around them , threatening their eyes with salt and grit . There 's the thin sound of laughter from somewhere up-deck and , far below , the engines ' grumbling . <p> " Last night , " she says . She strokes a pearl in the scoop of her neck . " That was gutless . I 'm really sorry . It 's just you show up , after all these years , a priest , but there 's still that ... I do n't know , between us . I did n't know how to tell you- " <p> " It 's all right , " he says . " I 'm just glad you found me now . " He says the words simply to soothe her , but as they come out he realizes they 're true . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Destiny 's wake . <p> Just standing here , feeling graced , at the hem of her moonshadow , he 's not unconvinced of divinity at work . He needs her right now , and she 's appeared ; what clearer sign should he expect ? He steps into the lee of her tall , exquisite form , her body heat a faint radiance . <p> " There you are , " booms a man 's baritone . <p> They turn back to the deck to find its source . Andrew , the redheaded trip leader , strides toward them , his dinner jacket catching wind like a sail . " I know , " he says , " tour guides should be on time . " He grins for a calculated instant , then ducks to land a kiss below her ear . <p> " Andrew , " she says , pulling away , " I think you know Father Tim ? " " Sure , of course . You came along at Ocho Rios . " Andrew traps him in a double-handed shake . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I turned in early , " says Father Tim . He reclaims his hand and hides it in his pocket . <p> Draping his arm around Alison 's waist , Andrew tips his head skyward . " Wow . Talk about beautiful . " It 's not clear if he means Alison or the moon . " What 's the plan ? More dancing ? Champagne ? " He whirls on the toes of his wingtips . <p> Alison tries to smile , but it comes off as a cringe . She looks uneasily at Father Tim . <p> " Oh , no problem , " Andrew says . " Do you want to tag along , Father ? " " No , " says Alison . " This was just an accident . I mean , coincidence . <p> Tim was taking a midnight stroll . " <p> " Actually , " he says , " I was kind of looking for you . " He feels his biceps , still sore from this afternoon 's workout , contract beneath his cooling skin . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with an overreaching laugh . " Hey , three 's a good number . The Holy Trinity ! " He laughs again-short , spanking bursts of sound . <p> Alison shushes him . With a muddled gaze she turns to Father Tim . " What I wanted to say . Andrew and I ... we 're engaged . " <p> " Happily , " says the guide , hugging her . " Proposed at the falls in Ocho Rios , matter of fact . A couple of cruises ago . " <p> Father Tim glances down to her ring finger , sees the diamond . She must have taken it off for their Jolly Roger date . " You could n't have told me ? " he says . <p> " I was going to . I should have . I just did n't want it to be the first thing-like you did n't want to be seen as celibate , right off . And after that ... well , it seemed harder . " <p> It 's a chickenshit excuse , he thinks-as lame as his own defensiveness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them downstairs to the Paradise Lounge for ballroom dancing . Father Tim declines . He ca n't look at Alison . Instead he turns , as the sound of their double footfalls fades , to the railing and its view of the wake . The water recedes in ever widening furls , two lines that will never intersect . <p> The Wedding Chapel is on the Fantasy Deck , catty-corner from the duty-free shop . It 's a smallish room , painted in sunny , stained-glass shades as if to compensate for the absence of windows . Unaccountably , there 's an overboiled , industrial-food smell that reminds Father Tim of waiting in a line . <p> The ship 's photographer , a schnauzer-faced , fidgety man , caps and uncaps his camera 's lens . By the altar , at parade rest , stands Captain Dickerman in a blue uniform with golden epaulets . The priest has warned them this will likely be a bust ; only one couple prepaid for the Renewal of Vows , and that couple is Babs and Les . <p> They 've agreed to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The souvenir champagne flutes with the Sun Line Cruises logo stand empty on a silver tray . The commemorative certificate , awaiting the captain 's signature , remains stowed in its coral cardboard tube . <p> " Call it quits ? " the photographer suggests . " I 'm due to shoot some ' after ' pics at the spa . " <p> Captain Dickerman consults his watch . Pouting slightly , as if pained to be deprived of the pomp , he nods . The photographer collapses his tripod . <p> " Better luck next cruise , " says Father Tim . He thumps his book of rites against his palm . <p> " Father , " says the captain , lingering . " You 're fresh from seminary , are n't you ? Might you weigh in on a theological debate ? " <p> " Do n't expect any miracles , " says the priest . <p> " I hear you got the highest grades in your class . " <p> " That 's right , " he says , wishing he were slightly worse at tests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " Here 's what I 've wondered , " the captain says . " The wedding vows are for life , are they not ? Till death do us part , ' etcetera ? So how can a renewal of those vows be justified ? Is that conceding that they are n't permanent ? " The captain bares a cunning , trump-card grin . <p> Dredging his mind for an answer , Father Tim finds only worthless jetsam . Right and wrong seem like dim , distant shores . He 's about to admit he 's stumped when Babs and Les walk in . <p> The captain hails back the photographer . " We 're in business , " he calls exultantly . <p> Babs wears a sleek satin dress that accentuates her figure 's hills and dales . Her face is tanned now to the mousy shade of her hair , which has been frosted and teased aloft with spray . <p> Father Tim reaches haltingly for her shoulder . They both stiffen with a brief static shock . " We 'd almost given up on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he touched her . " Me , too . " <p> Les , in his tuxedo , shifts and twists his neck , self-conscious as a Great Dane in a sweater . " Sorry , " he says . " Sometimer 's again . Could n't remember where I 'd stashed the ring . " He produces a small , velvet-covered jewelry box and hands it to Captain Dickerman . <p> " Marvelous , " the captain says . " It 's just not a cruise without a little ' I do . ' " <p> Wife and husband stand at a measured distance , seeming to regard each other with a mix of fear and hopefulness . In her dress Babs appears breathless , girdled . Father Tim sees where tears have streaked her rouge . But when Les takes her hand she offers a small smile and at long last quietly exhales . <p> What happened ? Father Tim wants to ask . A more responsible priest might halt the proceedings and insist that the couple talk straight . But in the end he can never glimpse the hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he to say a commitment is n't true ? <p> " My other shoot , " the photographer reminds them . He taps twice on the back of his wrist . <p> " By all means , " says the captain . " On we go . " <p> The anniversary pair shuffle half a step closer with the awkwardness of blind dates . Les winks . Babs double-checks her hair . <p> Father Tim opens his ritual and begins . " Repeat after me , " he says to Les . " ' I renew my commitment to you , my wife . " ' <p> Les matches his cadence word for word . <p> With text in hand , his mind is free to drift . He conjures the future and envisions it all too well : the dozens and dozens of weddings he 'll oversee , and the others he wo n't witness or attend-Alison 's wedding to Andrew , his own . He 'll have God 's touch , and that will have to be enough . <p> " I promise again to be true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in health , to love and honor you all the days of my life . " Father Tim states the pledge that from his lips is n't binding ; Les <p> repeats it and the words gather weight . <p> The priest turns to Babs and says , " Ready ? " <p>
