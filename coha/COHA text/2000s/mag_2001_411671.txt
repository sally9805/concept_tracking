Section : AT WAR The spiritual father of bin Ladenism <p> The September 11 terrorists lived for a long period with the certain knowledge that they were preparing their own deaths . Nineteenth-century nihilists and bomb-throwers and Bolsheviks also planned long term to sacrifice their lives for the cause . They moved in circles of poverty and desperation . It is the use of leisure time that separates out today 's Islamic extremists from their predecessors in fanaticism and terror . <p> For a start the September 11 terrorists had plenty of other people 's money and credit cards for the easy life . They hired cars and traveled . They bought expensive gadgets and communications systems . As Muslims , they were forbidden alcohol , but they frequented bars , and stood drinks all round . Again as Muslims , they were also supposed not to run after women , but they resorted to call girls and strip joints . A Florida lap dancer , the gorgeous Samantha , informs us that she displayed her charms a few inches from one terrorist , but the fellow then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men particular is that they were about to destroy what they were evidently enjoying . <p> This ambivalence feeds the hatred of the United States felt by Islamic extremists . In the Islamic world , religion and custom combine to provide strict codes of conduct in public and private life . Like all things human , respect for these codes varies according to time and place . It was the West that introduced Muslims to quite other codes of conduct affecting issues great and small in their society . The challenge seemed all the greater because the West had the power of its science and technology , and the social organization to make the most of this power . Western codes of behavior liberated , even as they alienated , Muslims . <p> Between the wars , Muslims began to rebuild their traditional code of conduct into systematic resistance to the West . Hassan al-Banna was born in 1906 in Egypt . He became a schoolteacher . The Western way of life , he taught , was materialistic , based on products , with nothing to offer man except " sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showy attractions . " Democracy to him only spread degeneracy . As pressure to adopt or imitate Western codes of conduct mounted , al-Banna came to believe that the West intended to destroy Islam " in the hearts of the faithful . " What made Muslims special , in his thinking , was their religion , and they had to turn it into a weapon for offense and defense . For that purpose , he founded the Muslim Brotherhood , a militant and conspiratorial group that by 1940 or so claimed to have 40,000 members . Al-Banna was shot dead in 1949 , probably by the Egyptian secret police , but branches of the Muslim Brotherhood exist today in every Arab country . Some of these branches have joined the establishment , others are still revolutionary ; and the secret police keep close watch on them all . <p> Sayyid Qutb was also born in Egypt in 1906 , and he took over and extended the fanaticization of Islam as preached by al-Banna . In the 20th century probably no other Muslim intellectual was so influential . Nothing in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have been unfailingly polite , he spoke good English and passed as cosmopolitan . At Cairo University he studied literature , and afterwards became a modernist critic commenting on books of the day . He had strong opinions about the role of the state in education , and accordingly was sent by the government to the United States to write a report on American education . <p> From 1948 to 1950 he lived and traveled in America . It would be fascinating to reconstruct his life here . Like the al-Qaeda terrorists today , he seems to have had an enjoyable time , but this only hardened his view that he had discovered the source of all evil . Seventeenth-century Puritans had that cast of mind : Their concentration on rooting out the sins of the flesh acknowledges the almost irresistible force of the temptation they felt . Did some other gorgeous Samantha tantalize Qutb ? Was he put down , or patronized ? His inquiring politeness , at any rate , transformed into anger and enmity . <p> Fellow Muslims in America , he said , apologized for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He on the contrary was determined to speak out and polemicize . Radical Islam , a pioneering study by Emmanuel Sivan , describes the conclusions to which Qutb came . Christianity with its notions of sin and redemption " made no sense at all . " Capitalism was " predicated on monopoly and interest-taking , money-grubbing , and exploitation . " American individualism " lacks any sense of solidarity and social responsibility other than that laid down by the law . " He attacked " that crass and materialistic perception of life , that animal freedom which is called permissiveness , that slave market dubbed ' women 's liberation . ' " <p> Bin Laden : A projection of Qutb <p> Returning to Egypt , he resigned his government job , and became a full-time writer , rising through the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood to become head of its propaganda section . As Islam revealed itself helpless against both American capitalism and Soviet communism , his outlook grew more and more pessimistic and violent . He expounded a doctrine that the whole world was in a state of jahiliyya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in three sorts : Westerners ( and that included the Soviets ) , Muslims who had adopted Western ideas , and the Jews who were always conspiring . <p> Westerners were " culturally poisoning " Islam , and Qutb brought in witnesses to that effect ranging from Arnold Toynbee to ( odd as it may seem ) the spies and traitors Burgess and Maclean , then in the headlines as they defected to Moscow . The West offered Muslims a model of moral and social depravity . Islam had to wage all-out war against all the types of modernity on offer ; no compromise was possible . Muslims who adopted ideas like nationalism or the sovereignty of the people were collaborators , stooges , traitors . More frightful still , these apostate Muslims were willing tools of the Jews , who were even more utterly beyond redemption . A " massive army of Jewish agents in the form of professors , philosophers , doctors and researchers-sometimes also writers , poets , scientists and journalists " were conspiring to weaken and deform Islam . He was the first to label them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later elaborated a more sophisticated version of this fantasy . <p> In the Egypt of the Fifties , Gamal Abdul Nasser was advocating nationalism as the basis of an Arab revival , but actually building a Soviet-style one-party state-as complete a dead end in its way as Qutb 's Islamic rigidity . To the Muslim Brotherhood this was sacrilege , and they almost succeeded in assassinating Nasser . Qutb duly sanctioned such terror . The Egyptian president responded in kind , and had Qutb and some 20,000 other opponents arrested . Brought to court , Qutb drew attention to marks of torture on his body . In prison for nine years , he wrote books that continue to resonate throughout the Arab world . In 1966 Nasser had him hanged . <p> More than a disciple , the Saudi-born Osama bin Laden seems like a projection of Qutb . The child of a well-connected Saudi entrepreneur and billionaire , the young bin Laden was also well educated , learned English , and initially became a cosmopolitan . Photographs show him in Western clothes , enjoying himself in Oxford and Geneva and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . His change of heart is not yet documented , but the sense of helplessness and frustrated power that Qutb had seems to motivate bin Laden as well to wage all-out war against Western types of modernity . <p> Just as Qutb was willing to use terror to stop Nasser , so bin Laden is prepared to overthrow the monarchy in his native Saudi Arabia . The country resists the presence of foreigners within its borders , and forbids them completely from entering the holy cities of Mecca and Medina ( imagine , by the way , the uproar if the Vatican allowed in only Catholics ) . Permitting American bases on the holy soil-indeed sheltering behind those bases against other Muslims such as Saddam Hussein-King Fahd and the royal family are selling out , nothing less than traitors to Islam . This is Qutb 's pagan barbarity , and cause for Islamic war . Instead of arresting him for sedition and hanging him as Nasser hanged Qutb , the Saudi royal family knew that bin Laden had influential friends at court and they merely outlawed him . Weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of double-dealing to any forthright decision , and so they end up in tangles of self-inflicted confusion . In the same hope of having things both ways , they subsidized the Taliban who are providing bin Laden with a safe haven in Afghanistan from which to operate against their own interests . Had they been more resolute , they would not now be relying on the United States to eliminate on their behalf so mortal an enemy . <p> In the cases of Qutb and bin Laden , militant Islam legitimizes the objective of taking power . But in their outlook and language resonates a terrible sense of inferiority . They have to get even . Hate and terror here are the counterparts of the tormenting admiration these men have for the supremacy of the West , and even for the Jews , everlastingly conspiring . It 's schizophrenic , and that 's the trouble . <p> By David Pryce-Jones <p>
