Men 's Health(R) CHALLENGE They 're big and they 're hungry , but do n't offer them any finger good <p> IF YOU 'RE LOOKING for the most amazing thing you can do underwater  --  with your wet suit on , anyway  --  this is it . Don a chain-mail suit and scuba gear , descend to the depths , then dole out fish scraps to a circling pack of 6-foot , 200-pound Caribbean reef sharks . <p> It looks dangerous , but if you play by the rules , you 're at greater risk of getting writer 's cramp ( from signing all the waiver forms ) than of being bitten . The body armor protects you from minor scrapes and accidental hand-to-mouth contact , but the real insurance comes from understanding the animals and reading their body language . <p> You 'll learn this and more in any of the new shark-feeder programs offered by dive operators in the Bahamas . All feature personal instruction in shark behavior , conservation , feeding , and safety .

The Essential Skill <p> Learning to distinguish the sex of a shark is useful for keeping the feed under control . Males are smaller but more aggressive . Females tend to be larger but more docile , and may even let you scratch their bellies .

The Training Program <p> This is more physical than it looks . You 'll need cardiovascular fitness and strength to handle breathing through a regulator , shouldering the usual 40 to 50 pounds of scuba gear ( plus the 22-pound shark suit ) , and moving in a medium 800 times denser than air . <p> Any aerobic activity will suffice , as long as it 's done at a sweat-producing level for at least 30 minutes , three times a week .
