<p> Nag factor . Pester power . These have become familiar buzzwords in the conference rooms of America 's most powerful ad agencies , according to Enola Aird , mother of two teens . <p> " Advertisers want kids to wear down their parents , and they devote hours to figuring this out , " says Ms. Aird . " They are determined to ' own ' our children from a young age , turn them into lifelong consumers , and sell to them wherever they can find them . " <p> Aird is not merely venting . As director of the Motherhood Project in Washington , an offspring of the Institute for American Values , she knows that it 's her job to speak out about the concerns of parents . The commercialization of childhood in today 's media-crazed culture is now front and center among those concerns , she says . <p> American corporations spend $ 15 billion per year on advertising and marketing to children , twice what they spent 10 years ago . As the average child reportedly watches 40 hours of television per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences $ 500 billion in annual spending - on toys , fast food , electronics , and more - this investment appears to be paying off . <p> With spending soaring and product-hawking venues burgeoning far beyond TV , many parents , educators , and other concerned citizens are becoming fed up by what they consider a rampant assault of commercialism on children . <p> These individuals feel simultaneously powerless against a multibillion-dollar industry but also emboldened by new scientific research . Studies by the Kaiser Foundation and the World Health Organization both link childhood obesity to fast-food advertising . The American Psychological Association has found that children under 8 are incapable of understanding persuasive intent . <p> To strengthen their voices , many of these adults are becoming activists by participating in grass-roots ad-busting advocacy groups such as Aird 's , so that they can be better heard on the national stage and especially by lawmakers . <p> In addition to the Motherhood Project , which is lobbying for congressional hearings on regulation of TV commercials , some of the most prominent groups are the Citizen 's Campaign for Commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children ; Dads and Daughters ; and perhaps the leader of the pack , the Oregon-based Commercial Alert . <p> With Gary Ruskin at its helm , Commercial Alert has gained recent attention on Capitol Hill for its " Parents ' Bill of Rights . " <p> The document includes nine provisions to help parents combat commercial influences , one of which calls for banning advertising aimed at children under 12 and two of which have already been introduced in the US Senate . <p> The first bill under consideration requires fast-food chains to disclose basic nutritional information , and the other , introduced last month by Sens . Ron Wyden ( D of Oregon ) and Ted Stevens ( R of Alaska ) , would ban list brokers without parental permission from collecting data about children 16 and under - everything from ethnicity and family income to hobbies - and selling it to advertisers and marketers . <p> This practice extends even to the diaper set , which is especially alarming to parents . But no matter what the child 's age , parents consider these lists an invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they learn that their child 's information could be sold on the Internet , " says Chris Fitzgerald , press secretary for Senator Wyden . <p> " These list brokers work by stealth , " says Mr. Ruskin . " No one even knows this is happening . Children are naturally more trusting than adults , and that trust is often easy to exploit . " <p> Repeated calls to two of the best-known list brokers , American Student List and Student Marketing Group , were not returned . But Doug Wood , general counsel to both the Association of National Advertisers and the Advertising Research Foundation , spoke up in list brokers ' favor . Banning them , he says , would be discriminatory and a violation of the First Amendment . <p> He does n't even favor an " opt out " feature similar to the Do Not Call Registry for telemarketers . " There would be a huge rush of parents who sign up out of ignorance , " Mr. Wood explains . " Some of the things they sell to kids are valuable . The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad thing . " <p> But Wood , who has three children , does concede that list brokers might want to tweak their approach : " They could do themselves a favor by being more open , " he says . <p> The Children 's Listbroker Privacy Act will be heard sometime before October , says Courtney Schikora , press secretary for Senator Stevens . That may not be soon enough for some activists , but most are encouraged that politicians are listening . <p> Just say ' no ' <p> " The fact that Congress is taking seriously what 's happening to kids is a really important step , " says Diane Levin , professor of education at Wheelock College in Boston and author of six books , including " Remote Control Childhood . " <p> " Commercial culture has gotten out of control , " adds Dr. Levin . " It affects who kids are , who they are becoming , how they handle money , how they want to look ... even some 4-year-olds I know are demanding ' belly-button shirts ! ' " <p> To which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with saying ' no ' ? " Instead of pointing the finger at corporations , Wood says , the blame should be directed at parents who let their kids push them around . <p> Becky Benson concurs . The Minnesota mom , who does n't subscribe to cable TV or allow her preteen daughters to use e-mail , believes some parents simply are n't doing their job . <p> " Instead of asserting their authority , they give in to their kids , " she says . " Saying ' no ' is the most powerful way to keep things under control . " <p> Are current regulations enough ? <p> Also helpful in keeping things under control , says Wood , are regulatory agencies and laws already in place . He says the Children 's Online Privacy Protection Act ( COPPA ) of 1998 , which shields children 13 and under from Internet advertising , is effective , as are the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) and the Children 's Advertising Review Unit ( CARU ) . <p> " These are respected and legitimate organizations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wood says . <p> These groups have good intentions , but they ca n't do it all , says Lisa Flythe , a new employee of the Motherhood Project , who previously worked for MTV and also developed written commercial guidelines for Nickelodeon . <p> " The volume of material and the number of outlets and opportunities have increased dramatically , " she says . " Even with their best efforts , they ca n't possibly monitor all the questionable material out there . " <p> Of course , the monitoring job can start with parents , says Susan Linn , a child psychologist and instructor at Harvard Medical School . They can take TVs out of kids ' bedrooms , limit screen time , and say " no . " But to think that moms and dads can do it all , she adds , is naive . <p> " One family in isolation can not counter a $ 15 billion industry , " Dr. Linn says . <p> " And regulators simply are n't doing enough , " she adds . " It 's not just that children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence the title of Linn 's new book , " Consuming Kids : The Hostile Takeover of Childhood , " in which she asserts that children are now the focus of a marketing maelstrom . In an ideal world , Linn would ban all marketing aimed at kids . <p> This may sound radical , she says , but when considered in the context of many other countries , she adds , where regulations are often much more stringent than in the US , it 's really not . <p> America may not be Sweden , where marketing is banned to children under 12 . But Linn is not ready to throw up her hands just yet . She is encouraged by growing awareness and activism in groups like her own , the Coalition to Stop Commercial Exploitation of Children , which she founded with Levin in 2000 . <p> Even though SCEC has been around for a while , she says , interest has never been stronger . " People are starting to realize they are not alone , and to believe there is something they can do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent surge in ad-busting activism a " growing social movement . " She adds with a sigh , though , " Like most social movements , this one could take a while to make an impact . <p> " It will be a long haul . " <p> The Parents ' Bill of Rights aims to protect children <p> The Parents ' Bill of Rights contains nine " acts " intended to help parents limit the ways marketers can advertise to children . Congress is currently considering the first two items . <p> * Children 's Food Labeling Act : Would require fast-food restaurant chains to label contents of food and provide basic nutritional information about it . <p> * Child Privacy Act : Would give parents the right to control any commercial use of personal information concerning their children , and the right to know precisely how such information is used . <p> * Leave Children Alone Act : Would ban television advertising aimed at children under 12 years of age . <p> * Children 's Advertising Subsidy Revocation Act : Would eliminate tax deductibility as a business expense for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * Advertising to Children Accountability Act : Would require corporations to disclose who created all of their advertisements and who did the market research for each ad directed at children under 12 years of age . <p> * Commercial-Free Schools Act : Would prohibit companies from pitching products to children while the youngsters are in school and away from parental influence . <p> * Product Placement Disclosure Act : Would require corporations to disclose , on packaging and at the outset , any and all product placements on television and videos , and in movies , video games , and books . This would let parents know there are ads in media typically assumed to be ad-free . <p> * Child Harm Disclosure Act : Would create a legal duty for corporations to publicly disclose all information suggesting that their product(s) could substantially harm the health of children . <p> * Fairness Doctrine for Parents : Would make the broadcasting Fairness Doctrine apply to all advertising to children under 12 years of age , providing parents and community with response time on broad- cast TV and radio for advertising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
