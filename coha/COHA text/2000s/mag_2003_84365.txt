In San Antonio , Spurs brake for goose bumps , not speed bumps , as when Steve Kerr steered onto his street after Game 6 of the Western Conference finals and slowed to see , in yard after yard , hand-lettered signs limned in porch light : CONGRATULATIONS , STEVE , and GO SPURS GO . His own yard lay beneath a riot of toilet paper , as if  --  in the hours since he 'd left home  --  a shower of Charmin had fallen on the city . Kerr , touched , left the TP where it lay , a two-ply ticker tape . // A day later , as all of San Antonio was abuzz about Kerr  --  and his four three-pointers that sent the Spurs into the NBA Finals against the Nets  --  he slipped into an Italian restaurant for dinner . As recognition registered , patrons began popping to their feet , table by table , until the entire room had risen in applause . " Pretty amazing , " says Kerr , 37 . " And all for 13 minutes of action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Spur in San Antonio , where players are recognized everywhere they go , and even where they do n't go : As I disembarked from a hotel elevator last week in S.A. , a middle-aged woman , starstruck in her Spurs shirt , looked at me and said , " Danny Ferry ? ! " // When I recounted this story to the actual Ferry between Games 1 and 2 of the Finals last week , the Spurs forward  --  6 ' 10 " and bereft of body fat  --  said , smiling , " That 's quite a compliment for you . " // Indeed it is , for the Spurs are beloved in San Antonio , a city that the hometown Express-News last week noted has been " deemed the fattest in the United States and derided as ' Fat Antonio . ' " Which might have something to do with the surplus of signs , on restaurant marquees throughout the city , for something called a Breakfast Taco. // For San Antonians , then , there is perhaps a vicarious component to the Spurs ' exertions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . San Antonio was the first city to have or , indeed , to need an air-conditioned hotel , office building and fleet of municipal buses . The thought of alfresco exercise there  --  in June , in 98 ? heat  --  quickly yields to longneck Lone Stars on the Riverwalk , the city 's absurdly attractive urban waterway , which is enlivened by bars , boats and ( what 's better ? ) mariachi music . // Which made San Antonio an appropriate host for the first NBA Finals game between teams from the old ABA , a league whose defensive siestas  --  and ' fro-riddled fiestas  --  are legendary . San Antonio has a street named George Gervin Court , a George Gervin Youth Center , a George Gervin Technology Center and  --  best of all  --  a George Gervin , the ex-Spur who held a press conference last week to address , among other things , the relative circumference of his former hairdo . " Darnell had a ' fro , man , " Gervin said of ABA rival Darnell Hillman . " I had a mini-'fro. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endless E.T . index finger at Gervin and said , " This is his town . " Even now , shorn of his own memorable mushroom-cloud ' fro , the Doctor remains more regal  --  more indescribably cool  --  than any athlete on Earth . Or as NBA senior vice president of communications Brian McIntyre put it perfectly : " Julius still has his Juliosity. " // Doc and Ice were once literally basketball 's poster boys . Standing at center court last week in San Antonio , they appeared to have climbed off my own bedroom wall circa 1979 . When I asked Gervin how often he is asked to sign  --  by aging , unhinged , Sharpie-armed nerds  --  the seminal Nike poster of himself seated on an easy chair of ice blocks , he said , " All the time , man , all the time . " And then the Iceman wenteth , ducking out a side door , fearing , with good reason , that I was one of those nerds. // The pop-cultural presence of present-day Spurs is no less pervasive . Spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several dozen times , Malik Rose 's TV spot for Accident &amp; Injury Chiropractic . In a performance more wooden than Pinocchio 's , an actor endures a litany of industrial injuries to the spine , as the Spurs forward urges us again and again to call " 921-PAIN . That 's 921 ... PAIN . " // " It 's awesome , " says Ferry , of the Spurs ' fishbowl existence in San Antonio . " You 're part of the culture here . All the guys get involved in the community . " And the community gets involved in all the guys , which would seem to make negotiating a frozen-foods aisle somewhat problematic for a 7 ' 1 " civic icon like David Robinson . Except that it does n't . " You have to see David behind the scenes , " says Kerr . " See how open and friendly he is with any person who greets him on the street . " // Outside the SBC Center entrepreneurs sell T-shirts that say KISS MY ASTERISK , a reference to Lakers coach Phil Jackson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockout-shortened 1999 season , be scarlet-lettered in the record book . But the typographical symbol of the city is less the asterisk than inverted exclamation marks . Evident on buildings and billboards around San Antonio , they lend everything between them  --  ? BREAKFAST TACOS !  --  a festive air . // That wo n't change , even if the Nets do upset the Spurs . Which will be exceedingly difficult . For every Spur , like every other citizen of San Antonio , knows precisely what to do when his back 's pressed up against a wall : Call 921-PAIN . That 's 921 ... PAIN .
