JESS TAMBLYN Across the Spiral Arm , the gas-giant planets held secrets , dangers , and treasure . For a century and a half , harvesting vital stardrive fuel from the cloud worlds had been a lucrative business for the Roamers . Five years ago , though , that had all changed . Like vicious guard dogs , the hydrogues had forbidden all skymines from approaching the gas giants they claimed as their territory . The embargo had crippled the Roamer economy , the Terran Hanseatic League , and the Ildiran Empire . Many brave or foolish entrepreneurs had defied the hydrogues ' ultimatum . They had paid with their lives . Dozens of skymines were destroyed . The deep-core aliens were unstoppable and ruthless . But when facing desperate situations , Roamers refused to give up . Instead , they changed tactics , surviving-and thriving-through innovation . " The old Speaker always told us that challenges redefine the parameters of success , " Jess Tamblyn said over the open comm , taking his lookout ship into position above the deceptively peaceful-looking gas giant Welyr . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch of annoyance , " if I wanted to be pampered , I 'd live on Earth . " Kellum , an older clan leader and hands-on industrialist , signaled to the converging fast-dive scoop ships . The cluster of modified " blitzkrieg " skymines and a hodgepodge of small lookout craft gathered at what they hoped was a safe distance above the coppery planet . No one knew how far away the hydrogues could detect trespassing cloud thieves , but they had long since given up playing it safe . In the end , all life was a gamble , and human civilization could not survive without stardrive fuel . The ekti-scavenging crew powered up their huge scoops and containers , ready for a concerted plunge into the thick cloud decks . Hit and run . Their supercharged engines glowed warm . Their pilots sweated . Ready . Alone in his lookout ship , Jess flexed his hands on the cockpit controls . " Prepare to come from all sides . Move in fast , gulp a bellyful , and head for safety . We do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big harvesting ships acknowledged , they dropped like hawks after prey . What once had been a routine industrial process had become a commando operation in a war zone . When presented with the hydrogue threat , daring Roamer engineers had redesigned traditional skymining facilities . They had accomplished a lot in five years . The new blitzkrieg scoops had giant engines , superefficient ekti reactors , and detachable cargo tanks like a cluster of grapes . Once each tank was filled , it could be launched up to a retrieval point , passing off the harvested ekti a bit at a time without losing a full cargo load if-when-the hydrogues came after them . Kellum transmitted , " The Big Goose thinks we 're shiftless bandits . By damn , let 's give the drogues the same impression . " The Hansa-the " Big Goose " - paid dearly for every drop of stardrive fuel . As ekti supplies dwindled year after year , prices skyrocketed to a point that Roamers considered the risk acceptable . Five of the modified scoops now dispersed across the atmosphere , then plunged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds . With giant funnel-maws open , the blitzkrieg scoops roared through storm systems at top speed . They gobbled resources , compressing the excess into hydrogen-holding tanks while secondary ekti reactors processed the gas . As he flew his lookout mission , like a man in the crow 's nest of an ancient pirate ship , Jess deployed floating sensors into Welyr 's soupy clouds . The buoys would detect any large ships rising from the depths . The sensors might give only a few minutes ' warning , but the daredevils could retreat quickly enough . Jess knew that it did no good to fight . The Ildiran Solar Navy and the Hansa EDF had demonstrated that lesson often enough . At the first sign of the enemy 's arrival , his renegade harvesters would turn and run with whatever ekti they 'd managed to grab . The first blitzkrieg scoop filled one cargo tank and rose high enough to jettison it , leaving a smoke trail in the thin air . A resounding cheer echoed across the comm , and the competitive Roamers challenged each other to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward its rendezvous point . Safe . In times past , leisurely skymines had drifted over the clouds like whales feeding on plankton . Jess 's brother , Ross , had been the chief of Blue Sky Mine on Golgen ; he 'd had dreams , an excellent business sense , and all the hopes in the world . Without warning , though , hydrogues had obliterated the facility , killing every member of the crew .... Jess monitored his scans . Though the sinking sensor buoys detected no turbulence that might signal the approach of the enemy , he did n't let his attention waver . Welyr seemed much too quiet and peaceful . Deceptive . Every crewman aboard the blitzkrieg scoops was tense , knowing they had only one chance here , and that some of them would likely die as soon as the hydrogues arrived . " Here 's a second one , highest-quality ekti ! " Del Kellum 's harvester launched a full cargo tank . Within moments , each of the five blitzkrieg scoops had ejected a load of ekti . The scavengers had been at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a valuable haul . " Good way to thumb our noses at the drogues , " Kellum continued , his anxiety manifesting as chattiness over the comm band , " though I 'd prefer to slam them with a few comets . Just like you did at Golgen , Jess . " Jess smiled grimly . His cometary bombardment had made him a hero among the Roamers , and he hoped that the planet was now uninhabitable , all the enemy aliens destroyed . A strike back . " I was just following my Guiding Star . " Now many clans looked to Jess for suggestions on how they might continue their retaliation against the aliens ' nonsensical prohibition . " You and I have a lot in common , " Kellum said , his voice more conspiratorial now that he had switched to a private frequency . " And if you ever do another bombardment , might I suggest this place as a target ? " " What have you got against Welyr ? " Then he remembered . " Ah , you were planning to marry Shareen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Shareen Pasternak had been the chief of a skymine on Welyr . Jess recalled that the woman had an acidly sarcastic sense of humor and a sharp tongue , but Kellum had been delighted with her . It would have been the second marriage for both of them . But Shareen 's skymine had been destroyed in the early hydrogue depredations . Now three more ekti cargo tanks launched away from the racing blitzkrieg scoops . Trish Ng , the pilot of a second lookout ship , frantically radioed Jess , cutting off the conversation . " The sensor buoys ! Check the readings , Jess . " He saw a standard carrier wave with a tiny blip in the background . " It 's just a lightning strike . Do n't get jumpy , Ng . " " That same lightning strike repeats every twenty-one seconds . Like clockwork . " She waited a beat . " Jess , it 's an artificial signal , copied , looped , and reflected back at us . The drogues must 've already destroyed the sensor buoys . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent . " That 's all the warning we 're going to get . Everybody , pack up and head out ! " As if realizing they had been discovered , seven immense warglobes rose like murderous leviathans from Welyr 's deep clouds . The Roamer scavengers did not hesitate , retreating pell-mell up through the gas giant 's skies . A deep-throated subsonic hum came from the alien spheres , and pyramidal protrusions on their crystalline skins crackled with blue lightning . The Roamer daredevils had all seen the enemy shoot their destructive weapons before . Kellum ejected four empty ekti cargo tanks , throwing them like grapeshot at the nearest warglobes . " Choke on these ! " Jess shouted into the comm , " Do n't wait . Just leave . " Kellum 's diversion worked . The aliens targeted their blue lightning on the empty projectiles , giving the blitzkrieg scoops a few more seconds to escape . The Roamers fired their enormous engines , and four of the five harvester scoops lifted on an escape trajectory . But one of the new vessels hung behind just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped the facility to molten shreds . The crew 's screams echoed across the comm channel , then cut off instantly . " Go ! Go ! " Jess yelled . " Disperse and get out of here . " The remaining commando harvesters scattered like flies . The automated cargo tanks would go to their pickup coordinates , where the commandos could retrieve the haul at their leisure . The warglobes rose up , shooting more blue lightning into space . They struck and destroyed a lagging lookout ship , but the others escaped . The enemy spheres remained above the atmosphere for some time , like growling wolves , before they slowly descended back into the coppery storms of Welyr , without pursuing . Though dismayed at the loss of one blitzkrieg scoop and a lookout ship , the raiders were already tallying the ekti they had harvested and projecting how much it would bring on the open market . Alone in the cockpit of his scout ship , Jess shook his head . " What has happened to us , if we can cheer because our losses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )
