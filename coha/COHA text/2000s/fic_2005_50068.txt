" Rex Miller taught me more about the creative process than any writer I have ever known . Working with him , I came to understand that creativity is a black and terrorfilled realm into which the artist plunges , loads his bucket with howling madness , and hauls it to the surface where he then , somehow , must shape it in the cool light of rationality .... The challenge of taming this material for publication must have been like training a dragon to prance on a leash like a toy poodle . " - Richard Curtis , eulogy for Rex Miller , Chronicle , September 2004 . I GRABBED my lunch pail , my soul bucket , and my hard hat and headed for the door of the humble , drafty , company-owned shack where my family and I lived . I had intended to slip quietly away , while my wife and children were still sleeping , but their love and concern for me brought them instinctively awake before I could get out the door . Clematis , my beautiful wife , had never looked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she fought to control lent her features a twisted cast . " Rex , dearest , must you really return to the story mines so soon ? After all , you 've barely recovered from that incident with the wild metaphor . " I flexed my formerly dislocated shoulder and winced . Although I did n't have my full range of motion restored , I felt much better and was convinced I could handle any combative story elements that I might encounter today . More to the point , I could hardly afford another week out of work . Amalgamated Fiction Mining was hardly going to extend us credit on our rent or at the company store . If I did n't earn some royalties soon , I and my family would be out in the streets . " That incident was all my own fault , Clem . I never should 've tried fastening that dog collar on a dragon in the first place , never mind taking it for a walk on a leash . But you can rest easily , for I 'm only working the Limerick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but I thought I 'd take it slow at first - " Clematis clapped her hands together and grinned . " Oh , Rex , I 'm so relieved ! The worst that can happen to you there is for your distich to get enjambed ! " The twins - Ricardo and Ricardina - had been watching wide-eyed and tremulous while their mother and I talked . But now that everything seemed fine , they broke into shouts and happy farewells . " We 'll miss you , Daddy ! " " Come back safe ! " " Will you bring me a synecdoche ! Pretty please ! " " I want a periphrasis ! Just a little one ! Please ? " I tousled their heads and said , " We 'll see . I ca n't make any guarantees . " The children looked so crest-fallen at my refusal to promise them a few castoffs from the pit that I relented instantly . " Oh , all right , maybe just a little parable . But you have to share it ! " " We will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left my cottage behind . It was a short walk through the lanes of identical cottages to the minehead . Along the way , I picked up my companions in the soul-mining trade , grim , work-worn men and women all clad alike in soiled coveralls , carrying their clanking soul buckets on the way to another day down the narrative shaft . Eventually , having become part of a crowd of over fifty workers , I arrived at the elevator that would carry us downward into the depths of the psychical earth , deep into the fossilized subconscious , where we would hack at the uncooperative substance of our dreams , hoping to release at least a small soul spurt that would fill our buckets for later manipulation back on the surface , in the cool light of rationality . The rattletrap rusted wire cage of the elevator would hold only ten people at a time . I managed to crowd forward into the first batch of miners . I found myself among a host of familiar faces , most of them bearing scars . Bill Collard , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave-in last year . Susy Granville , who had lost three fingers on her left hand to a raging sonnet . Ilona Rhinebeck , who sported an eye-patch , thanks to a confused denouement . Wembley Kingman , whose hair had turned entirely white when confronted with an out-of-control trilogy . The only one among us who did n't exhibit the marks of long labor at the narrative interface was young Gifford Goodenow , who had joined us only last month . Now Gifford piped up in his nave way . " Boy , have I got a swell feeling about today 's shift . I think I might even discover a new subgenre ! " Bill Collard snorted through his walrus mustache . " Pshaw ! Last time thet happened was nigh on twenty years ago , when thet there lanky feller hit upon the cyberpunk lode . Retired right after , lor " bless " im ! " We all contemplated making such a rich strike as th elevator rattled downward . When the cage reached the bottom and we piled out , we found our shift boss awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering low-watt electric lights , Hank Huntsman presented a reassuring albeit admonishing sight . A grizzled old coot who had once been the deftest hand at shaping soul spurts into rip-roaring tales that Amalgamated Fiction Mining had ever employed , nowadays Huntsman , after the ravages that wrestling with the monsters of the id had inflicted on his mind and body , was fit only to supervise us . Nonetheless , his vast experience served to make our harsh lives a little safer . " Collard , " called out Huntsman , " you 're working the Romance Vein today . Granville , you 're in Metafictions . Miller , you signed up for Limericks . The rest of you head over to Legal Thrillers . Got a big call for them , we do . " We split up as dictated . Already the cage to the surface was heading up for another pod of soul-miners . I found myself alone at the Limerick Face , which was just as I liked it . Collaborating was never my strong suit . I grabbed one of the picks left on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew , but no soul stuff spilled out . Three hours of hard work intervened before I got my first soul spurt . Hastily dropping the pick , I grabbed my soul bucket and positioned it under the dribble of gooey black bile that jetted feebly from the wall . When the spurt tailed off , I had about four inches of churning , turbid matter in my bucket . I tentatively dipped my fingers into the greasy roiling plasm , trying to sense the shape of the limerick that I would have to pull with much exertion out of the vile mass , once aboveground . I got a faint sense of the rhymes-something about " patches " and " Natchez " - before I withdrew my fingers . Well , it would n't earn me any literary prizes , but it might help pay the rent . Around noon , just as I was eating my lunch , Huntsman came galloping down the narrow corridor and I knew there was trouble . " It 's that damn young fool Goodenow ! He 's got ahold of an allegory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of Christian Literature , and I hastened after him . A whole crowd of soul miners had formed a human chain in an attempt to rescue Goodenow from his fatal connection with the allegory . They were pulling with all their might , but having no success budging Goodenow or his tainted catch . At the far end of the chain , Goodenow himself grasped the spiky tail of the amorphous allegory , which was half-buried in a fracture of the rock , seeking to escape deeper into the strata of the mythic subconscious . " Gifford , " I shouted , " let the damn thing go ! Allegory 's been the death of many a finer writer than you ! " " No , Rex , I can handle it ! I just need the right protagonist to tame it - " The youthful fool had more ambition than common sense , but you had to admire his spirit . I remembered when I had been just as full of zeal . But that seemed an age ago . There must have been an irony leak nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the allegory poured on more power and pulled Gifford Goodenow right into the crack before he could let go of its sticky skin . The resulting messy compression and exsanguination of Gifford 's body was not a pleasant sight . We were just lucky not to lose anyone else . Well , needless to say , the rest of the shift passed under a definite pall . I doubt that anyone brought more than a vignette or an aphorism out of the soul mine that sad day . As I was riding the elevator up , clutching my pail with the lone limerick in it , I pondered the twists of fate that had consigned me to the narrative pit . I began to feel a little self-pity and even shame . Sensing my downcast mood , Ilona Rhinebeck dug into her own soul bucket , grabbed a mass of sludge , and dumped it atop my limerick . " For the kids , " she said . When I got home and the hearty family greetings were over , I disentangled Ilona 's contribution from the limerick and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an embryonic Young Adult fantasy novel . Watching their happy faces as they poked and prodded the squealing juvenile , I realized I would n't really want to work anywhere else . <p>
