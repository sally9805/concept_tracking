All Heart // Jackson Heights , Queens , was no special place , but my dad , Max , was a special guy . Here 's the kind of guy he was : If he was your friend and came over to your house and your wife was in a housecoat , he could hug her and you would n't think twice . There was nothing distasteful about Max S. Rickles . ( I never knew what the " S. " stood for , and neither did he . ) Everyone loved my dad . The man was all heart . // Best of all , he laughed at my humor . // He was an insurance salesman who provided for my mother and me , the only child . We were n't rich , but we were n't poor . We just were . We lived in a plain apartment like a million other apartments you see in New York City 's five boroughs . // Dad had a lighthearted attitude about life . He took it the way it came . He was the guy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to do it for you . // We 'd be sitting in our tired old Ford , the engine dead as a doornail . Dad would see someone he knew from our building . // " Charlie , " he 'd say , " here 's a couple of bucks . Make the car start . " // He also taught me all I know about home repairs . // Here 's how that worked : // Mom wants to hang a picture . // Max offers the janitor , the mailman  --  anyone who 's around  --  a couple of bucks to bang a nail in the wall . No one ever takes the money  --  they like Max too much  --  except the janitor , who 's mad because he has to live in the basement . // Max Rickles was a giving sort of man , but sometimes giving is n't as simple as it seems . I 'll give examples : // We belonged to a little Orthodox synagogue in Jackson Heights , where Dad was an important member . Once he was even president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its finances . It was not a wealthy group and the building required maintenance . On the High Holy Days , Dad would escort me and my cousin Allen , who later became a fine doctor , to prime seats near the altar . It turned out to be a land-lease deal . Ten minutes before the start of services , Dad would move us ten rows back . Five minutes later , he 'd say , " Okay , guys ! Find seats in the back . " // It turned out my father was selling tickets to services like a scalper at a ballgame . He was shuffling around the worshipers and moving some of the higher-donation members to better seats . The proceeds went directly to God . // In this same small synagogue , my lighthearted father was the only one who could deal with the weighty matter of death . When everyone was hysterically crying , Dad would quietly take care of everything . He 'd line up the limousines and make the cemetery arrangements . The bereaved families loved him . Dad was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off track . // Speaking of the track , that was Dad 's one vice . But it was n't the kind of vice that did him in . He bet cautiously  --  two dollars here , two dollars there . He loved the horses . Nothing gave him greater pleasure than winning ten bucks at Belmont . // He also loved many of the customers he sold insurance to . In fact , when they could n't cover their insurance payments , he 'd often do it for them . He wrote their names in his debit book and carried them on his back . When Dad died of a heart attack in 1953 , those same customers came to his funeral and put a box next to his grave where they paid off those debits . That 's how much they respected my dad . // By sheer coincidence , his grave site in Elmont , New York , faces the finish line at Belmont . How 's that for God 's help ? //
