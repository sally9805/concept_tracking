<p> LIKE the hand that suddenly pops out of the grave at the end of " Carrie , " the past keeps coming back to haunt the Bush White House . Last week was no exception . No sooner did the Great Decider introduce the Fox News showman anointed to repackage the same old bad decisions than the spotlight shifted back to Patrick Fitzgerald 's grand jury room , where Karl Rove testified for a fifth time . Nightfall brought the release of an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll with its record-low numbers for a lame-duck president with a thousand days to go and no way out . <p> The demons that keep rising up from the past to grab Mr. Bush are the fictional W.M.D. he wielded to take us into Iraq . They stalk him as relentlessly as Banquo 's ghost did Macbeth . From that original sin , all else flows . Mr. Rove would n't be in jeopardy if the White House had n't hatched a clumsy plot to cover up its fictions . Mr. Bush 's poll numbers would n't be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fictions . By recruiting a practiced Fox News performer to better spin this history , the White House reveals that it has learned nothing . Made-for-TV propaganda propelled the Bush presidency into its quagmire in the first place . At this late date only the truth , the whole and nothing but , can set it free . <p> All too fittingly , Tony Snow 's appointment was announced just before May Day , a red-letter day twice over in the history of the Iraq war . It was on May 1 three years ago that Mr. Bush did his victory jig on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln . It was May 1 last year that The Sunday Times of London published the so-called Downing Street memo . These events bracket all that has gone wrong and will keep going wrong for this president until he comes clean . <p> To mark the third anniversary of the Iraq invasion last month , the White House hyped something called Operation Swarmer , " the largest air assault " since the start of the war , complete with Pentagon-produced video suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished as either warfare or P.R . remains a mystery . ) It will take nothing less than a replay of D-Day with the original cast to put a happy gloss on tomorrow 's anniversary . Looking back at " Mission Accomplished " now is like playing that childhood game of " What 's wrong with this picture ? " It was n't just the banner or the " Top Gun " joyride or the declaration of the end of " major combat operations " that was bogus . Everything was fake except the troops . <p> " We 're helping to rebuild Iraq , where the dictator built palaces for himself , instead of hospitals and schools , " Mr. Bush said on that glorious day . Three years later we know , courtesy of the Army Corps of Engineers , that our corrupt , Enron-like Iraq reconstruction effort has yielded at most 20 of those 142 promised hospitals . But we did build a palace for ourselves . The only building project on time and on budget , USA Today reported , is a $592 million embassy complex in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . Symbolically enough , it will have its own water-treatment plant and power generator to provide the basic services that we still have not restored to pre-invasion levels for the poor unwashed Iraqis beyond the American bunker . <p> These days Mr. Bush seems to be hoping that we 'll just forget every falsehood in his " Mission Accomplished " oration . Trying to deflect a citizen 's hostile question about prewar intelligence claims , the president asserted at a public forum last month that he had never said " there was a direct connection between September the 11th and Saddam Hussein . " But on May 1 , 2003 , as on countless other occasions , he repeatedly made that direct connection . " With those attacks the terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States , " he intoned then . " And war is what they got . " It was typical of the bait-and-switch rhetoric he used to substitute a war of choice against an enemy who did not attack us on 9/11 for the war against the non-Iraqi terrorists who did . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Beltway establishment . " This fellow 's won a war , " the dean of the capital 's press corps , David Broder , announced on " Meet the Press " after complimenting the president on the " great sense of authority and command " he exhibited in a flight suit . By contrast , the Washington grandees mostly ignored the Downing Street memo when it was first published in Britain , much as they initially underestimated the import of the Valerie Wilson leak investigation . <p> The Downing Street memo  --  minutes of a Tony Blair meeting with senior advisers in July 2002 , nearly eight months before the war began  --  has proved as accurate as " Mission Accomplished " was fantasy . Each week brings new confirmation that the White House , as the head of British intelligence put it , was determined to fix " the intelligence and facts " around its predetermined policy of going to war in Iraq . Today Mr. Bush tries to pass the buck on the missing W.M.D. to " faulty intelligence , " but his alibi is springing leaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamp down on them . We now know the president knew that the intelligence he cherry-picked was faulty  --  and flogged it anyway to sell us the war . <p> The latest evidence that Mr. Bush knew that " uranium from Africa " was no slam-dunk when he brandished it in his 2003 State of the Union address was uncovered by The Washington Post : the coordinating council for the 15 American intelligence agencies had already informed the White House that the Niger story had no factual basis and should be dropped . Last Sunday " 60 Minutes " augmented this storyline and an earlier scoop by Lisa Myers of NBC News by reporting that the White House had deliberately ignored its most highly placed prewar informant , Saddam 's final foreign minister , Naji Sabri , once he sent the word that Saddam 's nuclear cupboard was bare . <p> " There was almost a concern we 'd find something that would slow up the war , " Tyler Drumheller , a 26-year C.I.A . veteran and an on-camera source for " 60 Minutes , " said when I interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fall 2004 , Mr. Drumheller has played an important role in revealing White House chicanery , including its dire hawking of Saddam 's mobile biological weapons labs , which turned out to be fictitious . Before Colin Powell 's fateful U.N . presentation , Mr. Drumheller conveyed vociferous warnings that the sole human source on these nonexistent W.M.D. labs , an Iraqi emigre known as Curveball , was mentally unstable and a fabricator . " The real tragedy of this , " Mr. Drumheller says , " is if they had let the weapons inspectors play out , we could have had a Gulf War I-like coalition , which would have given us the 300,000 to 400,000 troops needed to secure the country after defeating the Iraqi Army . " <p> Mr. Drumheller says that until the White House " comes to grips with why it did this " and stops " propping up the original rationale " for the war , it " will never get out of Iraq . " He is right . But the White House clings to its discredited fictions even though their expiration date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters each day . The Fitzgerald investigation continues to yield revelations of administration W.M.D. subterfuge , president-authorized leaks included . Should the Democrats retake either house of Congress in November , their subpoena power will liberate the investigation of the manipulation of prewar intelligence thatthe chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Pat Roberts , has stalled for almost two years . <p> SET against this reality , the debate about Donald Rumsfeld 's future is as much of a sideshow as the installation of a slicker Fleischer-McClellan marketer in the White House press room . The defense secretary 's catastrophic mistakes in Iraq can not be undone now , and any successor would still be beholden to the policy set from above . Mr. Rumsfeld is merely a useful , even essential , scapegoat for the hawks in politics and punditland who are now embarrassed to have signed on to this fiasco . For conservative hawks , he 's a convenient way to deflect blame from where it most belongs : with the commander in chief . For liberal hawks , attacking Mr. Rumsfeld for his poor execution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping on ( and abetting ) the blatant propaganda bandwagon that took us there . But their history ca n't be rewritten any more than Mr. Bush 's can : the war 's failures were manifestly foretold by the administration 's arrogance and haste during the run-up . <p> A new defense or press secretary changes nothing . The only person who can try to save the administration from itself in Iraq is the president . He can start telling the truth in the narrow window of time he has left and initiate a candid national conversation about our inevitable exit strategy . Or he can wait for events on the ground in Iraq and political realities at home to do it for him . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
