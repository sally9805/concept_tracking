For the weekly docket the court jester wore his standard garb of well-used and deeply faded maroon pajamas and lavender terry-cloth shower shoes with no socks . He was n't the only inmate who went about his daily business in his pajamas , but no one else dared wear lavender shoes . His name was T. Karl , and he 'd once owned banks in Boston . The pajamas and shoes were n't nearly as troubling as the wig . It parted at the middle and rolled in layers downward , over his ears , with tight curls coiling off into three directions , and fell heavily onto his shoulders . It was a bright gray , almost white , and fashioned after the Old English magistrate 's wigs from centuries earlier . A friend on the outside had found it at a secondhand costume store in Manhattan , in the Village . T. Karl wore it to court with great pride , and , odd as it was , it had , with time , become part of the show . The other inmates kept their distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood behind his flimsy folding table in the prison cafeteria , tapped a plastic mallet that served as a gavel , cleared his squeaky throat , and announced with great dignity : " Hear ye , hear ye , hear ye . The Inferior Federal Court of North Florida is now in session . Please rise . " No one moved , or at least no one made an effort to stand . Thirty inmates lounged in various stages of repose in plastic cafeteria chairs , some looking at the court jester , some chatting away as if he did n't exist . T. Karl continued : " Let all ye who search for justice draw nigh and get screwed . " No laughs . It had been funny months earlier when T. Karl first tried it . Now it was just another part of the show . He sat down carefully , making sure the rows of curls bouncing upon his shoulders were given ample chance to be seen , then he opened a thick red leather book which served as the official record for the court . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kitchen . Two of them wore shoes . One was eating a saltine . The one with no shoes was also bare-legged up to his knees , so that below his robe his spindly legs could be seen . They were smooth and hairless and very brown from the sun . A large tattoo had been applied to his left calf . He was from California . All three wore old church robes from the same choir , pale green with gold trim . They came from the same store as T. Karl 's wig , and had been presented by him as gifts at Christmas . That was how he kept his job as the court 's official clerk . There were a few hisses and jeers from the spectators as the judges ambled across the tile floor , in full regalia , their robes flowing . They took their places behind a long folding table , near T. Karl but not too near , and faced the weekly gathering . The short round one sat in the middle . Joe Roy Spicer was his name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal . In his previous life , Judge Spicer had been a Justice of the Peace in Mississippi , duly elected by the people of his little county , and sent away when the feds caught him skimming bingo profits from a Shriners club . " Please be seated , " he said . Not a soul was standing . The judges adjusted their folding chairs and shook their robes until they fell properly around them . The assistant warden stood to the side , ignored by the inmates . A guard in uniform was with him . The Brethren met once a week with the prison 's approval . They heard cases , mediated disputes , settled little fights among the boys , and had generally proved to be a stabilizing factor amid the population . Spicer looked at the docket , a neat hand-printed sheet of paper prepared by T. Karl , and said , " Court shall come to order . " To his right was the Californian , the Honorable Finn Yarber , age sixty , in for two years now with five to go for income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who would listen . A crusade by a Republican governor who 'd managed to rally the voters in a recall drive to remove Chief Justice Yarber from the California Supreme Court . The rallying point had been Yarber 's opposition to the death penalty , and his high-handedness in delaying every execution . Folks wanted blood , Yarber prevented it , the Republicans whipped up a frenzy , and the recall was a smashing success . They pitched him onto the street , where he floundered for a while until the IRS began asking questions . Educated at Stanford , indicted in Sacramento , sentenced in San Francisco , and now serving his time at a federal prison in Florida . In for two years and Finn was still struggling with the bitterness . He still believed in his own innocence , still dreamed of conquering his enemies . But the dreams were fading . He spent a lot of time on the jogging track , alone , baking in the sun and dreaming of another life . " First case is Schneiter versus Magruder , " Spicer announced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Schneiter 's not here , " Beech said . " Where is he ? " " Infirmary . Gallstones again . I just left there . " Hatlee Beech was the third member of the tribunal . He spent most of his time in the infirmary because of hemorrhoids , or headaches , or swollen glands . Beech was fifty-six , the youngest of the three , and with nine years to go he was convinced he would die in prison . He 'd been a federal judge in East Texas , a hardfisted conservative who knew lots of Scripture and liked to quote it during trials . He 'd had political ambitions , a nice family , money from his wife 's family 's oil trust . He also had a drinking problem which no one knew about until he ran over two hikers in Yellowstone . Both died . The car Beech had been driving was owned by a young lady he was not married to . She was found naked in the front seat , too drunk to walk . They sent him away for twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Inferior Court of North Florida , better known as the Brethren around Trumble , a minimum security federal prison with no fences , no guard towers , no razor wire . If you had to do time , do it the federal way , and do it in a place like Trumble . " Should we default him ? " Spicer asked Beech . " No , just continue it until next week . " " Okay . I do n't suppose he 's going anywhere . " " I object to a continuance , " Magruder said from the crowd . " Too bad , " said Spicer . " It 's continued until next week . " Magruder was on his feet . " That 's the third time it 's been continued . I 'm the plaintiff . I sued him . He runs to the infirmary every time we have a docket . " " What 're ya 'll fightin over ? " Spicer asked . " Seventeen dollars and two magazines , " T. Karl said helpfully . " That much , huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time at Trumble . Finn Yarber was already bored . With one hand he stroked his shaggy gray beard , and with the other he raked his long fingernails across the table . Then he popped his toes , loudly , crunching them into the floor in an efficient little workout that grated on the nerves . In his other life , when he had titles-Mr . Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court-he often presided while wearing leather clogs , no socks , so that he could exercise his toes during the dull oral arguments . " Continue it , " he said . " Justice delayed is justice denied , " Magruder said solemnly . " Now that 's original , " said Beech . " One more week , then we 'll default Schneiter . " " So ordered , " Spicer said , with great finality . T. Karl made a note in the docket book . Magruder sat down in a huff . He 'd filed his complaint in the Inferior Court by handing to T. Karl a one-page summary of his allegations against Schneiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperwork . One page and you got your day in court . Schneiter had replied with six pages of invective , all of which had been summarily stricken by T. Karl . *** The rules were kept simple . Short pleadings . No discovery . Quick justice . Decisions on the spot , and all decisions were binding if both parties submitted to the jurisdiction of the court . No appeals ; there was nowhere to take one . Witnesses were not given an oath to tell the truth . Lying was completely expected . It was , after all , a prison . " What 's next ? " Spicer asked . T. Karl hesitated for a second , then said , " It 's the Whiz case . " Things were suddenly still for a moment , then the plastic cafeteria chairs rattled forward in one noisy offensive . The inmates scooted and shuffled until T. Karl announced , " That 's close enough ! " They were less than twenty feet away from the bench . " We shall maintain decorum ! " he proclaimed . The Whiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a young Wall Street crook who 'd bilked some rich clients . Four million dollars had never been accounted for , and legend held that Whiz had stashed it offshore and managed it from inside Trumble . He had six years left , and would be almost forty when paroled . It was widely assumed that he was quietly serving his time until one glorious day when he would walk free , still a young man , and fly off in a private jet to a beach where the money was waiting . Inside , the legend only grew , partly because Whiz kept to himself and spent long hours every day studying financials and technical charts and reading impenetrable economic publications . Even the warden had tried to cajole him into sharing market tips . An ex-lawyer known as Rook had somehow got next to Whiz , and had somehow convinced him to share a small morsel of advice with an investment club that met once a week in the prison chapel . On behalf of the club , Rook was now suing the Whiz for fraud . Rook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The usual rules of procedure and evidence were dispensed with so that the truth could be arrived at quickly , whatever form it might take . " So I go to the Whiz and I ask him what he thinks about ValueNow , a new online company I read about in Forbes , " Rook explained . " It was about to go public , and I liked the idea behind the company . Whiz said he 'd check it out for me . I heard nothing . So I went back to him and said , ' Hey , Whiz , what about ValueNow ? ' And he said he thought it was a solid company and the stock would go through the roof . " " I did not say that , " the Whiz inserted quickly . He was seated across the room , by himself , his arms folded over the chair in front . " Yes you did . " " I did not . " " Anyway , I go back to the club and tell them that Whiz is high on the deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ValueNow . But little guys ca n't buy because the offering is closed . I go back to Whiz over there and I say , ' Look , Whiz , you think you could pull some strings with your buddies on Wall Street and get us a few shares of ValueNow ? ' And Whiz said he thought he could do that . " " That 's a lie , " said Whiz . " Quiet , " said Justice Spicer . " You 'll get your chance . " " He 's lying , " Whiz said , as if there was a rule against it . If Whiz had money , you 'd never know it , at least not on the inside . His eight-by-twelve cell was bare except for stacks of financial publications . No stereo , fan , books , cigarettes , none of the usual assets acquired by almost everyone else . This only added to the legend . He was considered a miser , a weird little man who saved every penny and was no doubt stashing everything offshore . " Anyway , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big position in ValueNow . Our strategy was to liquidate our holdings and consolidate . " " Consolidate ? " asked Justice Beech . Rook sounded like a portfolio manager who handled billions . " Right , consolidate . We borrowed all we could from friends and family , and had close to a thousand bucks . " " A thousand bucks , " repeated Justice Spicer . Not bad for an inside job . " Then what happened ? " " I told Whiz over there that we were ready to move . Could he get us the stock ? This was on a Tuesday . The offering was on a Friday . Whiz said no problem . Said he had a buddy at Goldman Sux or some such place that could take care of us . " " That 's a lie , " Whiz shot from across the room . " Anyway , on Wednesday I saw Whiz in the east yard , and I asked him about the stock . He said no problem . " " That 's a lie . " " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spicer . " Picasso . " Picasso was sitting behind Rook , as were the other six members of the investment club . Picasso reluctantly waved his hand . " Is that true ? " Spicer asked . " Yep , " Picasso answered . " Rook asked about the stock . Whiz said he would get it . No problem . " Picasso testified in a lot of cases , and had been caught lying more than most inmates . " Continue , " Spicer said . " Anyway , Thursday I could n't find Whiz anywhere . He was hiding from me . " " I was not . " " Friday , the stock goes public . It was offered at twenty a share , the price we could 've bought it for if Mr. Wall Street over there had done what he promised . It opened at sixty , spent most of the day at eighty , then closed at seventy . Our plans were to sell it as soon as possible . We could 've bought fifty shares at twenty , sold them at eighty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in profits . " Violence was very rare at Trumble . Three thousand dollars would not get you killed , but some bones might be broken . Whiz had been lucky so far . There 'd been no ambush . " And you think the Whiz owes you these lost profits ? " asked ex-Chief Justice Finn Yarber , now plucking his eyebrows . " Damned right we do . Look , what makes the deal stink even worse is that Whiz bought ValueNow for himself . " " That 's a damned lie , " Whiz said . " Language , please , " Justice Beech said . If you wanted to lose a case before the Brethren , just offend Beech with your language . The rumors that Whiz had bought the stock for himself had been started by Rook and his gang . There was no proof of it , but the story had proved irresistible and had been repeated by most inmates so often that it was now established as fact . It fit so nicely . " Is that all ? " Spicer asked Rook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Brethren had no patience with windy litigants . Especially ex-lawyers still reliving their glory days . There were at least five of them at Trumble , and they seemed to be on the docket all the time . " I guess so , " Rook said . " What do you have to say ? " Spicer asked the Whiz . Whiz stood and took a few steps toward their table . He glared at his accusers , Rook and his gang of losers . Then he addressed the court . " What 's the burden of proof here ? " Justice Spicer immediately lowered his eyes and waited for help . As a Justice of the Peace , he 'd had no legal training . He 'd never finished high school , then worked for twenty years in his father 's country store . That 's where the votes came from . Spicer relied on common sense , which was often at odds with the law . Any questions dealing with legal theory would be handled by his two colleagues . " It 's whatever we say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stockbroker on the court 's rules of procedure . " Clear and convincing proof ? " asked the Whiz . " Could be , but not in this case . " " Beyond a reasonable doubt ? " " Probably not . " " Preponderance of the evidence ? " " Now you 're getting close . " " Then , they have no proof , " the Whiz said , waving his hands like a bad actor in a bad TV drama . " Why do n't you just tell us your side of the story ? " said Beech . " I 'd love to . ValueNow was a typical online offering , lots of hype , lots of red ink on the books . Sure Rook came to me , but by the time I could make my calls , the offering was closed . I called a friend who told me you could n't get near the stock . Even the big boys were shut out . " " Now , how does that happen ? " asked Justice Yarber . The room was quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . " Happens all the time in IPOs . That 's initial public offerings . " " We know what an IPO is , " Beech said . Spicer certainly did not . Did n't have many of those back in rural Mississippi . The Whiz relaxed , just a little . He could dazzle them for a moment , win this nuisance of a case , then go back to his cave and ignore them . " The ValueNow IPO was handled by the investment banking firm of Bakin-Kline , a small outfit in San Francisco . Five million shares were offered . Bakin-Kline basically presold the stock to its preferred customers and friends , so that most big investment firms never had a shot at the stock . Happens all the time . " The judges and the inmates , even the court jester , hung on every word . He continued . " It 's silly to think that some disbarred yahoo sitting in prison , reading an old copy of Forbes , can somehow buy a thousand dollars ' worth of ValueNow . " And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rook fumed while his club members began quietly blaming him . " Did you buy any of it ? " asked Beech . " Of course not . I could n't get near it . And besides , most of the high-tech and online companies are built with funny money . I stay away from them . " " What do you prefer ? " Beech asked quickly , his curiosity getting the better of him . " Value . The long haul . I 'm in no hurry . Look , this is a bogus case brought by some boys looking for an easy buck . " He waved toward Rook , who was sinking in his chair . The Whiz sounded perfectly believable and legitimate . Rook 's case was built on hearsay , speculation , and the corroboration of Picasso , a notorious liar . " You got any witnesses ? " Spicer asked . " I do n't need any , " the Whiz said and took his seat . Each of the three justices scribbled something on a slip of paper . Deliberations were quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who announced , " By a vote of two to one , we find for the defendant . Case dismissed . Who 's next ? " The vote was actually unanimous , but every verdict was officially two to one . That allowed each of the three a little wiggle room if later confronted . But the Brethren were well regarded around Trumble . Their decisions were quick and as fair as they could make them . In fact , they were remarkably accurate in light of the shaky testimony they often heard . Spicer had presided over small cases for years , in the back of his family 's country store . He could spot a liar at fifty feet . Beech and Yarber had spent their careers in courtrooms , and had no tolerance for lengthy arguments and delays , the usual tactics . " That 's all today , " T. Karl reported . " End of docket . " " Very well . Court is adjourned until next week . " T. Karl jumped to his feet , his curls again vibrating across his shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one stood , no one moved as the Brethren left the room . Rook and his gang were huddled , no doubt planning their next lawsuit . The Whiz left quickly . The assistant warden and the guard eased away without being seen . The weekly docket was one of the better shows at Trumble.
