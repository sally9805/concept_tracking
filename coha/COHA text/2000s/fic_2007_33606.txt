Chapter One Charlotte , North Carolina Present Day Sir ... he 's gone . " Theophilus Hamilton stood near the large glass window that framed a world he hardly understood anymore . He did n't turn around but instead let his gaze fall to the busy city below . A deep sadness tangled his words , so he took a moment to compose himself . The inevitable had finally come , but it did n't make it any easier . He stayed at the window as he addressed Miss Hastings . " Contact family members , the various corporate boards and business interests ... " He sighed . There was a lot to take care of . Now was n't the time to mourn . And Hamilton knew that perhaps he mourned more for what Red had endured in life . Red was at peace now , but there would be nothing resembling peace in the wake of his death . " And let 's call a meeting . " " Yes , sir , " Miss Hastings said . She turned to leave the room , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so sorry for your loss . " She pulled the heavy oak doors of his office closed . Clutching his cane , he gazed out the dark window and wondered how well he would be able to tolerate the wolves that had been waiting and circling for days now . Oh , yes , they would put on their sad faces . Some of them . Others would adopt a false solicitousness . No matter . Everything was set into motion now ; no man could change it . And he doubted itwould change any man , either . But for a man whose life had gone terribly wrong in so many different ways , he 'd had hope all the way to the end . Hamilton closed his eyes . The older he got , the less he held out much optimism for anything . But maybe , just maybe , he had a little , too . His mind wandered back to the first time he 'd ever heard Red 's voice . It had been a phone call , placed to Hamilton right after he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theophilus Hamilton ? " " Sir , yes-Yes , sir . This is he . " " Name 's Howard Stevens . You can call me Red . I need a lawyer for a few business ideas I have , a few still in the dream stage . " Hamilton smiled now . Red Stevens and his dreams . He was at peace . But Theophilus understood peace would not be a part of his own immediate future . * * * The day could n't have been grayer . Hamilton stood near the pastor , surveying the five-hundred-plus mourners who clustered around the shiny mahogany casket of Red Stevens . Flowers , bright and white , were the only color among a graveyard filled with stately , aboveground tombs and important people all dressed in suitable dark clothing , every single one carrying a black umbrella . Their faces reflected more aversion to the rain they were forced to stand in than to the death of the man they were here to lament . Behind the mourners and down the hill a little , Hamilton spotted one pink umbrella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rain , since the young girl was n't putting it over her head . Instead , she seemed to be the only one embracing the moment , with her face tilted upward to the sky as it bathed her in wetness . Hamilton sighed . Oh , how he wished there could be more of that kind of goodness and innocence in the world . The pastor , hunched under his own black umbrella , cupping his little black book , was doing his best to uphold the sanctity of the moment . " Though the skies may weep , " he said , " the Bible assures us that ' precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints . ' " No one-near Hamilton , anyway-looked as though they cared at all what the Bible said . Red 's two sons , Bill and Jack , stood just three feet away , oblivious to the idea they were sup- posed to appear sorrowful . " I wonder who the old man negotiated with for the rain , " Jack said with a cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a sure bet he 's laughing , watching us get soaked . " " Yeah , well , now it 's his turn , " Jack said . " There 's not a person here , " the pastor continued , " whose life in some way has not been touched by Howard ' Red ' Stevens . " Hamilton watched Jack and Bill glance at each other and roll their eyes . Jack , the playboy of the family , pulled up the sleeve of his coat and looked at his watch . Bill glanced down at some sort of organizing device or cell phone in his hand , then quietly put it back in his pocket . It was all Hamilton could do not to say something , but that was n't his way . And it had n't been Red 's either . He 'd let his children become what they 'd become . He 'd tried a time or two to step in and talk some sense into any of them who would listen , but they never listened unless he was talking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way back to the little girl , who seemed intent on getting wet . He wondered why such a young girl felt the need to wear such dark lipstick . She could n't have been more than ten years old , but her lips were stained the color of wine grapes . What was the world coming to ? But he smiled as the mother suddenly noticed the umbrella to her side and rushed to put it back in its place , much to the young girl 's disappointment . " Red often quoted Malcolm Muggeridge , " the pastor said to a crowd growing more agitated with every wet minute that went by , " saying that ' every happening , great or small , is a parable by which God speaks to us ; and the art of life is to get the message . ' May the message of Red Stevens continue in the hearts of those he leaves behind . " The pastor seemed to sense he was losing their interest . He turned to Bill . " Bill ? " He gestured toward the casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping forward . Reaching into his coat , he pulled out a small canister . " Even though Dad moved his corporate offices from Texas many years ago , for tax reasons , he always said he wanted to be buried under Texas soil . " He opened the canister and shook some dirt onto the casket , then stepped back . Somebody touched Hamilton 's elbow . He did n't have to turn around . He knew it was Miss Hastings , assuring him he was right for keeping silent and avoiding a scene . Suddenly the loud rumblings of a car caused the entire crowd to turn as a vintage 1971 Dodge Charger R/T slowed on the small cemetery road below . What little dirt was left on the casket fell off as the ground shook from the revving engine . Hamilton could hardly stop himself from throwing up his hands in disgust . But then again , neither could the other mourners , whose mouths hung open at the sight of the yellow-and-black muscle car roaring to a stop in front of them . The young man getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't gotten the family memo about what kind of etiquette was expected . He flung the car door open , nursing a cigarette and likely a bad hangover , judging by the state of his clothes and hair . Some hideous rock-and-roll song thumped against the backdrop of the rainstorm , until he turned it off and rose out of the car . He wore black sunglasses and an expression that might 've been worse if they could see his eyes . Beside him an expression- less young woman appeared in a taut black dress that spoke to the idea she might be at the wrong social event . " Is that him ? " Miss Hastings whispered . " That 's him . " Hamilton sighed . He watched Jason Stevens walk up the small hill , dismissing his cigarette as he tossed it aside into a puddle . He also dismissed his girlfriend and two others who had crawled unsteadily from the backseat of the car , walking ahead of all of them and heading straight for his mother , Sarah . " Mom , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years , his mother was able to lift her eyebrows high in a frightful expression of embarrassment and shock . " You 're late ! " she said in a sharp tone . Jason Stevens propped his sunglasses on top of his head , glancing around at his family members with the kind of attitude that got you cut out of the will . Then he offered a perfectly inappropriate smile . " For what ? " (
