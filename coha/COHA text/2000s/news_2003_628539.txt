<p> OLYMPIA FIELDS , Ill. - The family is in Florida , sun-baked and sequestered , vacationing and grieving all at once , and everybody keeps insisting they 're doing fine , and Davis Love III knows they 're lying to him , knows it in his aching heart , and he plays along with the charade anyway . Amid the jumble of thoughts and feelings and regrets , he recognizes the deceptions for what they are . <p> Acts of kindness . <p> Compassion . <p> Love . <p> As opposed to the series of deceptions that leave Love and his family at such a profound loss . <p> The 103rd U.S. Open begins on Thursday , less than four weeks after the apparent suicide of his brother-in-law . Just like that , Love is trying to conquer all that Olympia Fields Country Club puts in front of him . Next to being the third-ranked player in the world , perhaps the best thing Love has going for him this week is this : A 7,190-yard , par-70 layout suddenly looks a lot smaller than life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping or doing something , but they keep assuring me they 're fine , " Love said . " They know that my place is to be , one , out here at work and , two , out here with my friends . My family of friends is out here , so they know I 'm in the right place . <p> " They know that I want to win this golf tournament , and they 're going to say they 're fine even if they 're not fine - that they 're having fun in Florida and go play golf . It 's a tough time , but everybody has to show that we 're strong and life goes on - for the kids , especially . " <p> Love discovered the body of Jeff Knight on May 16 in a sports utility vehicle parked outside the family fishing retreat in south Georgia . Knight , 37 , was n't merely a member of the family who left behind a wife and two children . He was a member of the family who betrayed them all . Knight had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and his death came four days after the FBI had begun investigating him for embezzlement . The suspicion is that Knight , a 37-year-old Gulf War veteran , embezzled as much as $ 1 million from his brother-in-law . His hunting buddy . Fishing buddy . <p> Still , Love has had nary a harsh word to say about Knight , who was haunted by severe weight problems and what he imagined to be doomsday Y2K scenarios in recent years . Upon his return to the PGA Tour last week at the FBR Capital , Love spoke warmly and fondly of Knight . Then Love went out and posted his fifth top-10 finish in 12 starts this year . <p> " If I were sitting around doing nothing , it would look like things are n't right , " Love said . " My kids were watching my golf scores last week , like they normally do , just casually ( asking ) , ' How did you play , Dad . Guess what we did today ? ' And I think that 's good for me and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes back to work . It 's a new normal , but life goes on . " <p> Life goes on with Love ranked No. 1 on the tour money list ( $ 3,927,962 ) . He has won three tournaments already this year , boosting his career victory total to 17 . He is ranked seventh on the tour in ball-striking , sixth in putting , fourth in greens in regulation , third in total driving and second in the all-around category . <p> At 39 , Love is closing in on $ 24 million in career earnings . Love Golf Design - which did not employ Knight - is a thriving operation that is in charge of making over the Forest Oaks Country Club , site of this year 's Chrysler Classic of Greensboro ( N.C. ) . Love is in a position to tailor his schedule to suit his wife Robin , daughter Alexia and son Davis IV . And so he does . <p> " Certainly up until the end of the Charlotte tournament ( the Wachovia Championship , his last tournament before Knight 's death ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love said . " And it shows you that career and your life of earning money or the business of life are not the most important thing . <p> " No matter how much success you have at your job or in your career , family is most important and can change anything . So we 've been reminded twice - tragically - in our family how important it is to say close and take care of each other . " <p> When Love was 24 , his father died in a private plane crash . Davis Love Jr . had been a distinguished golf instructor , and he lived long enough to see his son win a tour event ( the 1987 MCI Heritage ) . Davis Love III always considered it fitting that , as the son of a PGA teaching pro , his first - and so far , only - major came in the PGA Championship . That was in 1997 , the year before which any short list of Best Players Never To Win a Major had to include Love . <p> " I just took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a great player and people expect you to win , " Love said . " But I always felt that my expectations were much greater than anybody else 's . It 's definitely a category you want to get into and out of quickly . But getting into that category is a heck of a lot harder than getting out of it . Then it 's a matter of getting out of your own way . " <p> Defending U.S. Open champion Tiger Woods wonders how much a player in Love 's current condition can stay out of his own way . Woods remembers how hard it was for him to concentrate when his father had a heart attack in 1997 and a bypass operation the next year . Of course , that did n't stop Woods from winning the 1997 Masters by a record 12 strokes . <p> " That 's very difficult to deal with , " Woods said . " I did n't have to deal with a death in the family , but the distraction weighs on your mind . No matter how much you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it takes time to get over things like that . " <p> At a time like this , Love likes to draw on the words of his close friend , Fred Couples . Having been through a divorce to a woman who eventually committed suicide , hounded for years by back pain , Couples likes to say : " The most fun four or five hours of the day is inside the ropes . " <p> Love takes his performance at the FBR Classic as a sign that he can make the most of his time between the ropes . He was playing in a tournament for the first time in four weeks . He had n't picked up a club the first two weeks after Knight 's death . And he still shot 68 and 67 the final two rounds to finish in a tie for seventh . <p> " People came up and said , ' I ca n't believe you played so well , ' " Love said . " I said , ' I ca n't believe I bogeyed three holes in the last round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe when I go home next week it wo n't be as much fun as a normal week off . But I 'll still keep playing golf as hard as I can . " <p> The family is in Florida , hiding as much as they can how they 're hurting . Davis Love III is at the U.S. Open , trying to repay his loved ones for being kind enough to lie to him just a little . <p> " This is just a game , " Love said . " We take it way too seriously . We can learn a lot from it to apply to our daily life . We 're just lucky that we get to play in front of a lot of people , and they clap and we get paid a lot of money to do it . But it 's not the most important thing in the world .
