Having a monthly period is a drag  --  and now , thanks to a new birth-control pill called Seasonale , it 's unnecessary . Approved last Friday by the FDA , the pill contains the same ingredients found in the original Pill but works on a 91-day cycle instead of the traditional 28 . Women take active pills 84 days in a row , then placebos for the final week , reducing the number of periods from 13 a year to just four . <P> Though Seasonale is new , the idea behind it is not . Doctors have sometimes prescribed continuous birth control to suppress menstruation , whether for lifestyle reasons ( before a beach vacation , say ) or to avoid migraine headaches . One caveat : test subjects using Seasonale experienced nearly two weeks of bleeding during their first cycle . The spotting , however , diminished over time . <P>  --  S.S.
