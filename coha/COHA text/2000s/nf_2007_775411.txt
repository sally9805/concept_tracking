" My God : This Is the Pandemic . It 's Here ! " // " I had a little bird , and its name was Enza , // I opened the window , and in-flew-Enza. " // Children 's rhyme during the 1918 flu pandemic // In May 1997 a three-year-old boy in Hong Kong died of influenza . His death was n't unusual . Every year in every country in every corner of the world healthy children die of the disease . But this infection was different . Health officials could n't figure out what type of influenza virus had killed the boy , so they sent a sample of it to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta . There , researchers found that this particular virus had never infected people before . A few months passed . The rare influenza virus infected no one else  --  not the boy 's parents , or his relatives , or his friends , or his classmates . Later , the CDC sent a team of scientists to Hong Kong to investigate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold their chickens , they found what they were looking for  --  the source of the deadly virus . " The people here like their chickens fresh , " one investigator said . " Hygiene consists of a douse with cold water . One day we saw a bird standing up there , pecking away at its food , and then very gently lean over , slowly fall over , to lie on its side , looking dead . Blood was trickling from its beak . It was a very unreal , bizarre situation . I had never seen anything like it . " The disease spread to another chicken and another . // The strain of influenza virus that infected birds in Southeast Asia was particularly deadly , killing seven of every ten chickens . On December 30 , 1997 , Hong Kong health officials , in an effort to control the outbreak of bird flu before it spread to more people , slaughtered more than a million chickens . Still the virus spread . Bird flu attacked chickens in Japan , Vietnam , Laos , Thailand , Cambodia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the horror of local physicians , the virus infected eighteen more people , killing six  --  a death rate of 33 percent . ( Typically influenza kills fewer than 2 percent of its victims . ) Soon the virus disappeared . Officials waited for an outbreak the following year , but none came . And it did n't come the year after that or the year after that . The virus lay silent , waiting . // In late 2003 , six years after the initial outbreak , bird flu reappeared in Southeast Asia . This time health officials found it even harder to control . Again , the virus first infected chickens . Officials responded by slaughtering hundreds of millions of them . Despite their efforts , bird flu spread from chickens to ducks , geese , turkeys , and quail . Then the virus spread to mammals : first to mice , then to cats , then to a tiger in a Thai zoo , then to pigs , then to humans . By April 2005 , bird flu had infected ninety-seven people and killed fifty-three  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus had spread from birds in Asia to those in Europe , the Near East , and Africa . Two hundred fifty people living close to these birds got sick , and 146 of them died . International health officials feared that the appearance of bird flu in Southeast Asia signaled the start of a worldwide epidemic ( pandemic ) . One later remarked , " The clock is ticking . We just do n't know what time it is. " // Health officials feared an influenza pandemic because they knew just how devastating pandemics could be . During the pandemic of 1918 and 1919  --  the one called the last great plague  --  influenza infected five hundred million people , half the world 's population . The virus , which traveled to virtually every country and territory in the world , hit the United States particularly hard . In a single month , October 1918 , four hundred thousand Americans died of influenza . Influenza typically kills the most vulnerable members of the population , the sick and the elderly . But the 1918 virus was different : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life span of Americans in their twenties and thirties decreased by 25 percent . When it was over , the 1918 pandemic  --  the most devastating outbreak of an infectious disease in medical history  --  had killed between fifty million- and one hundred million people worldwide , all within a single year . In comparison , since the 1970s the AIDS pandemic has killed twenty-five million people . // Pandemics of influenza are inevitable . During the past three hundred years , the world has suffered ten of them , about three per century . No century has ever avoided one . But despite their frequency and reproducibility , only one man has ever successfully predicted an influenza pandemic and done something about it . // His name was Maurice Hilleman . Born Saturday morning , August 30 , 1919 , during the worst influenza pandemic in history , Hilleman was the eighth child of Anna and Gustave Hillemann . ( Because of intense anti-German sentiment following the First World War , Hilleman 's parents deleted the second n on his birth certificate . ) Devoutly religious , Anna and Gustave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brothers ( Walter , Howard , Victor , Harold , Richard , and Norman ) after heroic characters in the Elsie Dinsmore books , stories of Christian faith popular in the late 1800s . The birth took place in the family 's home on the banks of the Tongue and Yellowstone Rivers , near Miles City , Montana . // After Maurice 's birth , and to the surprise of the homeopath who delivered him , a second child , Maureen , was also born , still and lifeless . The doctor tried desperately but unsuccessfully to revive her . He cupped his hands around her back and , using only his thumbs , periodically pushed down on her tiny chest . At the same time , he tried to breathe air into her lungs . It was no use . From the corner of the room , Anna Hillemann quietly watched the doctor try to save her baby daughter . When she learned that Maureen was dead , Anna closed her eyes , saying nothing . Gustave buried Maureen the following day , August 31. // Hours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anna 's body stiffened , her eyes rolled up in . . . //
