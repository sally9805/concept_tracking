It 's 8:45 a.m. on a Wednesday and I 'm in overdrive . Oatmeal is being eaten standing up , backpacks stuffed on the fly , permission slips signed with a scrawl , and if the kids leave the house in 30 seconds , they 'll have exactly five minutes to get to school before " O Canada " rings out over the PA system . Then comes the all-too-familiar announcement : " Mom , my science project is at Daddy 's and it 's due today ! " Daddy 's house is a 15-minute walk from mine in our Toronto neighbourhood . Daddy 's not home , having taken advantage of his child-free morning to be at the office early . And Mommy has misplaced the key to his home . This is a typical , harried morning in our joint-custody family , where my two children , aged 11 and eight , split their time evenly between my home and my ex-husband 's . He gets them Monday and Tuesday nights , I 've got them Wednesday and Thursdays , and we alternate Friday-to-Sunday . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we believe the benefits of such an arrangement far out-weigh the difficulties . My ex and I participate equally in the upbringing of our children , and they are sunny , well-adjusted kids , mostly unscathed by our breakup . We believe that 's because they 've never been denied either of us for very long and we remain good friends . We both raise our children  --  neither of us is the fun parent , the mom or dad who sees them one weekend a month , drops wads of guilt cash at theme parks and orders in pizza for dinner . We each do the grunt work : the science projects , the laundry , the lunches , the middle-of-the-night stomach flus , sick days and field trips . And as much as we miss them on those days when they 're with the other parent , the children are happier for it , and that 's the point . We appear to be part of a growing trend , according to the Canadian Institute of Child Health . While there are few statistics available on how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotally , shared parenting arrangements seem to be on the rise . But making a shared arrangement fly requires a lot of hard work and is n't for every child , says Rhonda Freeman , director of Families in Transition in Toronto . " Some kids have easy temperaments and can adapt to different situations ; others are anxious and hard to settle , " she says . " Those children can have a harder time with the back-and-forth of a 50-50 arrangement . " Graph Not Transcribed Open lines of communication between both homes , new partners who are comfortable with the set-up , strong organizational skills and , most importantly , a supportive relationship with the ex are key , the experts say . Alison Molyneux is the stepmother of two girls , aged 11 and nine , who spend two weeks at their dad 's , then two weeks at their mom 's . Molyneux , who lives near London , Ontario , says the set-up works well because of consistency and good communication . " Rules are for the most part similar . When they are grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next home , " she says . " And the girls " biological mother and I keep in constant contact over school work , discipline and a host of other things . " So much depends on how the parents behave . In her book Mom 's House , Dad 's House , Isolina Ricci devised a bill of rights for families living apart that calls for parents to refrain from involving the children in grievances or disputes with their exes . My ex and I follow the no-slagging rule : If we must vent , and sometimes we do , we try never to do it within earshot of the children . We 've also agreed that we 'll always present a united front to the kids in every area  --  discipline , homework , rules , friends and so on . That united front is crucial , says John Service , executive director of the Canadian Psychological Association ( CPA ) in Ottawa and a long-time family psychologist . If the kids decide mom is a soft touch and dad is the heavy , they 'll soon be wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will throw any equal custody arrangement into chaos . " It 's natural children would try to get the upper hand and play one parent against the other , " he says . Rules aside , sometimes it 's logistics surrounding a joint-custody agreement that present the real challenge . Barely a day goes by when my children , if they 're with me , are n't calling their dad to ask him to drop off something they 've left at his place . When they 're at their dad 's , I get calls at all hours of the day and night asking if I know the whereabouts of some treasured toy , item of clothing or homework paper . Late-night trips between both houses are common . So are packages and papers stuffed in mail-boxes or left on the front porch . It often feels as though a successful 50-50 arrangement requires the organizational skills of an anal-retentive military strategist . You have to sit down and decide who keeps the health cards , the hockey gear , the winter coats , the camping stuff , the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who 's responsible for the math homework , who will ensure they 're reading their assigned books , who keeps the favourite stuffed animal ? Every Sunday night before they go to their dad 's , I attempt to run through the week ahead , asking about volleyball practices , field trips , soccer games , assignments , birthday parties . The next day I shove clothes and jerseys and knee pads into their knapsacks if I know they 're going to need them days later . I get to work and e-mail their dad a heads-up . He does the same for me . Audrey Grifith(1) is a newly separated mother of two from Calgary . She and her ex have a week-on , week-off arrangement , something that was hard on her six-year-old daughter at first . But Griffith says the family is now getting into a new groove . " Flexibility and being able to see the kids during the week they 're at their father 's house has been the key . I scored the other week because the kids came to my house for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really enjoyed having dinner together , and I would expect the same flexibility from their dad if I had a work emergency . I also would n't hesitate to give him access to the kids on my days if he wanted it . " The practical matters of actually organizing the children 's lives have not been as difficult as expected , Griffith says , thanks to one useful tool : " A green plastic tub that goes back and forth between both houses with the skates , backpacks , whatever needs to go with them . They know to put stuff in the tub , though there is usually at least one trip with forgotten articles they ca n't live without , like Beanie Babies , GameBoys , a library book . " Edward Kruk , a professor of social work and family studies at the University of British Columbia , says there 's one absolute must to making the set-up work : " It takes real maturity on the part of the people involved . There has to be a separation of the marital issues from the ongoing parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if both parties accept that , the organizational headaches are far easier to resolve and manage . " If you were the injured party in the relationship , heeding such advice might be difficult , Kruk acknowledges . But if you keep children from another loving parent who wants to share equally in raising them , or you bad-mouth that parent , you run a real risk of your child harbouring resentment and anger towards you in years to come , he says . Rhonda Freeman believes that many divorcing parents benefit from bringing in a mediator or a family counsellor to help create an arrangement that works . ( The family service organization in your community can direct you to such programs , which often provide help for free or on a sliding scale for lower-income families . ) " I 've had parents walk in here and say : " I want a 50-50 arrangement , ' ' " she says . " My response is : " Let 's see what the child is ready for , what the child can deal with . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about the child . And there is no one-size-fits-all solution . A neutral third party can meet with the child and assess what he can handle in terms of how much time he can spend away from either parent . Are there siblings ? Does the child have separation anxiety ? " Some kids really rely on routine , and those children may not be well suited to splitting their time between two homes . And what if there are step-siblings in the mix ? If you or your ex has remarried , your children may now be sharing their space and their lives with other children  --  something that can lead to a host of other woes if the kids resent it . Renee Carter manages such a situation . She 's the mother of two boys and two stepsons aged four , seven , nine and 11 . The four-year-old has his own room because he 's the youngest and has to go to bed earlier . The seven- and nine-year-olds happily share a room . The 11-year-old gets the guest bedroom , but if there are houseguests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his four-year-old half-brother 's room , tiptoeing in after the younger one 's asleep . The two older boys spend most of their time at their mother 's so they do n't mind sharing space . Graph Not Transcribed " It works well because they like being together , " says Carter , who lives near Oxford , Nova Scotia . " You also have to be flexible . I let my seven-year-old stay up a little later when his nine-year-old stepbrother is there so that they go to bed at the same time . But I am strict about light 's out  --  when it 's bedtime , it 's bedtime , no fooling around , and they respect that . " Once you 've worked out a 50-50 setup , there 's still one reality that no parenting plan can address  --  that omnipresent divorced-parent guilt . You 'll experience it no matter how many experts tell you that shared arrangements are better for the kids . You 'll miss them when they 're with the other parent , and the longing will dissipate only slightly as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And with clothes and belongings to keep track of and lives lived at two separate houses , you 'll notice your children are required to grow up a lot faster than they might have otherwise . They did n't choose to live this way , or to be without mom or dad half their lives , and would n't be living like this if you and your ex were still together . And that keeps those guilty feelings close to the surface . Dave Campbell , 39 , has a shared arrangement with his ex-wife and knows full well the negative side : He misses his three-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter when they 're not with him . Since his marriage ended two years ago , the kids spend Sunday to Wednesday with him , then go to their mother 's house from Wednesday night to Sunday afternoon . " Of course , I 'd much rather have them all the time , " says Campbell , a Toronto deejay . " But it 's been a success to a certain point because they are well-adjusted and happy kids  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have preferred a traditional , white-picket-fence , married-for-a-lifetime sort of thing . It 's hard to let them go on the Wednesday and know I 'm not going to see them " til the Sunday . But as time passes , it 's getting easier . " But Edward Kruk says it best : " So much terrible damage can be done to children by depriving them of the other parent . The organizational headaches are nothing compared to the emotional repercussions . " Something to remember the next time that science project 's been left at Daddy 's house .
