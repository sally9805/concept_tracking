The Yolk 's on You : // Egg Balancing and the Equinox // Consider the humble chicken egg . // Outside , its hard white calcium shell is mostly round and smooth . It might have small bumps on it , or even tiny ridges and waves , but its overall geometry is so well defined that we use the term " egg-shaped " when we see something similarly crafted . The very word " ovoid " comes from the Latin for " egg . " // Inside , we have the white part of the egg  --  the technical term is albumen  --  and the yellow yolk . This goo is what is destined to become a chicken , if we let it . Usually we do n't . Humans have all sorts of dastardly schemes planned for chicken eggs , from the simple act of cooking them to such bizarre practices as frying them on sidewalks to show how hot it is and using them to " decorate " houses on Halloween night . // But there is an even weirder ritual performed with the ovum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and around the world , this ritual is performed at the beginning of the spring season . On or about March 21 , schoolchildren , newspeople , and ordinary citizens take a chicken egg and try to stand it on end . // A nonscientific survey  --  conducted by me , by asking audience members when I give public talks and people I meet at parties or standing in line at grocery stores  --  shows that about one-half the population has either heard of this practice or tried it themselves . That 's roughly 130 million people in America alone , so it 's certainly worth investigating . // If you 've watched this ritual , or have tried it yourself , you know that it takes incredible patience , care , and stamina . It also takes luck , a flat surface , and a sprinkling of bad astronomy . // At first glance you might not expect astronomy to play any great role here . However , like the cultural rites of ancient peoples , it 's the timing that 's important . This ritual is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time when the Sun crosses from the southern to the northern hemisphere of the sky . The spring equinox is called the vernal equinox by astronomers ; the root of the word " vernal " means " green , " which has obvious links to springtime . To my mind , the idea of balancing an egg is as strange a way to celebrate the spring equinox as is dancing at the foot of Stonehenge dressed as Druids . // So what are the details of egg standing , exactly ? It goes something like this : According to the legend , it 's only possible to stand an egg on end and have it balance perfectly on the exact date of the spring equinox . Some people even claim that it must be done on the exact time of the equinox . If you try it any other time , even minutes before or after , you 'll fail . // That 's all there is to it . Seems simple , right ? Every year at the magical date , newscasters  --  usually TV weatherpeople , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about balancing eggs . A lot of schoolrooms , in an effort to perform a scientific experiment , also try to get the little ova upright . Sometimes the newscasters will go to the classroom to show the tykes trying , and after a while , voil ? ! Someone gets an egg to stand ! The cameraman is rushed over and the beaming future scientist gets his or her face on TV that night , film at eleven . // Unfortunately , if the teacher does n't go any further , the child 's future as a scientist may be in some doubt . This has n't really proven the legend one way or another . Let 's take a closer look at it . // We need to start by asking what should be an obvious question : why would the vernal equinox be the only time you can do this ? I have asked that of people who believe the legend to be true , and they make vague claims about gravity aligning just right on that special day . The Earth , the egg , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . But this ca n't be right : there is always some point on the surface of the Earth exactly between the center of the Earth and the Sun . It has nothing to do with any special time . And should n't the Moon have some effect too ? The Moon 's gravitational force on the Earth is pretty large , so its gravity is pretty influential . Yet the Moon plays no part at all in the legend . Obviously , the vernal equinox is not the root of the issue . // Luckily , we do n't have to rely totally on theory . The legend of vernal egg-balancing makes a practical prediction that can be tested . Specifically , the prediction is : If an egg will stand only on the vernal equinox , then it will not stand at any other time . Once you think of it that way , the experimental verification is obvious : try to stand an egg on end some other time . The vernal equinox is usually on March 21 or thereabouts every year . To test the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other day , a week , month , or even farther from the time of the equinox . The problem is , most people do n't follow through with the experiment to its logical conclusion . They only try it on the equinox , and never on any other day . // However , I 've tested it myself . The picture shows not just one but seven eggs standing on end in my kitchen . Of course , you 're skeptical  --  as you should be ! Skepticism is an important scientific tool . But why take my word for it ? Chances are it 's not March 21 as you read this . Go find some eggs and give it a try . I 'll wait . // * * * // Finished ? So , could you do it ? Maybe not . It 's not easy , after all . You need patience , a steady hand , and a fairly strong desire to balance an egg . After I got those eggs balanced , I had trouble balancing any more . My wife happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heck I was doing , and she quickly decided that it looked like fun . Actually , I think it was her competitive nature that drove her ; she wanted to stand up more eggs than I did . She did . Actually , she had a hard time at first . I told her that I had heard it 's easier to stand an egg if you shake it a little first to help the yolk settle . She did , but pressed too hard on the shell . While she was shaking it her thumb broke through the shell , and she got glop all over the wall of our kitchen ! I imagine we have the only house in the country where something like this could happen . // Eventually , she was successful . She was the one who got the rest of the eggs to stand ; we got eight total from that one carton . Clearly , her hands are steadier than mine . Once , when scheduled to give a public talk about Bad Astronomy at the Berkshire Museum of Natural Science in Pittsfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . I had to change my clothes quickly and literally run to the auditorium . When I arrived , I was out of breath and my hands were shaking a little from the stress and excitement . I usually start off the lecture by balancing an egg , but because I was shaking a little I had a very hard time of it ! I struggled with the eggs all during the time the lecture series curator was introducing me , and by some sort of miracle I got it balanced just as he finished announcing my name . To this day , it 's the loudest and most pleasing ovation I have ever received . // The lesson here is that if you are patient and careful , you can usually get one or two eggs from a carton to stand . Of course , you can also cheat . If you sprinkle salt on the table first , it will support the egg . Then you gently blow on the remaining salt so that it gets swept away . The salt holding up the egg is almost invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , however , would never do something like this . Honest ! Actually , over the years I have become pretty good at balancing eggs with no tricks . Practice makes perfect . // Still , this does n't answer the question of how an egg can balance at all . It 's such an odd shape , and oddly balanced . You 'd really just expect it to fall over every time . So just why does an egg stand ? I 'll admit to some ignorance of the structure of eggs , so to find out more about it I decided to find an expert . // I found a good one right away . Dr. David Swayne is a poultry veterinarian for the United States Department of Agriculture in Athens , Georgia . When pressed , he admits to knowing quite a bit about chicken eggs . I bombarded him with questions , trying to get to the bottom , so to speak , of the anatomy of an egg . I was hoping that somewhere in the structure of an egg itself was the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came first , it or the chicken ) . // The characteristic shape of an egg , he explained to me , is due to pressure from the chicken 's reproductive system as the egg is pushed through the reproductive organs . The yolk is made in the ovary , and the albumen is added as the yolk is forced through a funnel-shaped organ called an infindibulum . The white-yellow combination is only semi-gooey at this point , and it is covered with a membrane . The infindibulum forces the egg through using peristalsis , a rhythmic squeezing and relaxing of the infindibulum . The back part of the egg getting pushed gets tapered from being squeezed , and the end facing forward gets flattened a bit . That 's why an egg is asymmetric ! Eventually , the egg reaches the shell gland , where it sits for roughly 20 hours and has calcium carbonate deposited all around it . That 's what forms the shell . The calcium comes out in little lumps called concretions , which is why eggs sometimes have little bumps on the bottom . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out the chicken . ( At this point I 'll stop the narrative and you can use your imagination for the last part of the egg 's journey . After hearing Dr. Swayne discuss it I could n't eat an omelet for weeks. ) // At this point I had two theories about egg balancing . One was that if you let the egg warm up , the albumen will thin a bit and the yolk will settle . Since the yolk moves down , the center of gravity of the egg lowers , making it easier to stand . Dr. Swayne put that to rest pretty quickly . " The viscosity of the albumen does n't depend on temperature , " he told me . " It 's designed to keep the yolk pretty much in the middle of the egg . " That makes sense ; the yolk is really the embryo of the chicken and should n't get jostled too much . The albumen keeps it from bumping up against the inside wall of the shell , where it might get damaged . A thinned albumen ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick . Warming the eggs wo n't help much in standing them on end . // My other working theory relied pretty heavily on those little calcium bumps . They are almost always on the bottom , fatter end of the egg . According to my theory , these imperfections act like little stool legs , which help support the egg . Through my own experimenting I found that a smooth egg is very difficult if not impossible to stand up , but a bumpy one is actually pretty easy , once you get the hang of it . So it 's not the vastness of space and the infinite subtle timings of the Earth as it orbits the Sun that gets the egg to balance , I concluded , it 's the stubby little bumps on the end . So much for the grandeur of science . // Yet the legend persists . Science and reason are a good arsenal to have in the battle against pseudoscience , but in most cases they take a backseat to history and tradition . The egg-balancing legend has been around for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I get lots of e-mail from people about standing eggs on end , especially around the middle of March , shortly before the equinox . A lot of it is from people who think I am dead wrong . Of course it 's all about the equinox , they tell me . Everyone says so . Then they tried it on the day of the equinox for themselves , and it worked ! The egg stood ! // Of course it did , I tell them . It 'll stand on any other day as well , which they can prove to themselves if they just try it . They have n't followed through with their experiment , and they convince themselves they are right when the evidence is n't all in . They rely on word of mouth for what they believe , and that is n't a very strong chain of support . Just because someone says it 's so does n't make it so . Who knows from where he or she first heard it ? // In this case , we can find out . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lost in the murky history of repeated tellings . However , happily , this one has a traceable and very specific origin : Life magazine . As reported by renowned skeptic Martin Gardner in the May/June 1996 issue of the wonderfully rational magazine Skeptical Inquirer , the legend was born when , in the March 19 , 1945 issue of Life , Annalee Jacoby wrote about a Chinese ritual . In China , the first day of spring is called Li Chun , and they reckon it to be roughly six weeks before the vernal equinox . In most countries , the equinoxes and solstices do not mark the beginning of seasons ; instead , they 're actually the midpoints . Since a season is three months or twelve weeks long , these countries believe that the actual first day of spring is six weeks before the equinox. // The Chinese legend has an uncertain origin , according to Mr. Gardner , although it is propagated through old books about Chinese rituals . In 1945 a large number of people turned up in the city of Chunking to balance eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Life . Evidently , the United Press picked up the story and promptly sent it out to a large number of venues . // A legend was born . // Interestingly , Ms. Jacoby reported that balancing an egg was done on the first day of spring , yet it was never said  --  or else it was conveniently forgotten  --  that the first day of spring in China was a month and half before the first day of spring as recognized by Americans . This inconvenient fact should have put a wet blanket on the proceedings , but somehow that never slowed anything down . // In 1983 the legend got perhaps its most famous publicity . Donna Henes , a self-proclaimed " artist and ritual-maker , " gathered about a hundred people in New York City to publicly stand eggs up at the exact moment of the vernal equinox on March 20 , 1983 . This event was covered by the New Yorker magazine , and a story about it appeared in its April 4 , 1983 issue describing how Ms. Henes handed out eggs to the onlookers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointed time . Around 11:39 P.M. she upended an egg and announced , " Spring is here . " // " Everyone in the crowd , us included , got busy balancing eggs , " the New Yorker effused . " Honest to God , it works . " The unnamed reporter was not so convinced , however , as to swallow this line whole . Two days after the equinox , the reporter brought a dozen eggs to the same place where the ritual had occurred . For twenty minutes the reporter tried to balance the eggs but did n't get a single one to stand on its end . // ( Continues ... ) //
