<p> Seamus Kiel fit the stereotype of the starving artist . Waiting tables to support his photography , he moved to San Francisco from New York because " I thought it would be easier to be poor here than there . " <p> But two years ago , he 'd had enough . " I thought , ' I 'm doing the artist thing successfully , but I 'm not successful in a way to pay myself , ' " he recalled . " I do n't know how to market myself , sell myself , find my audience . " <p> Kiel , 35 , decided to quit his day job at a nonprofit organization and learn the business skills needed to survive on his photography . In doing so , he joined the ranks of a large but often unrecognized Bay Area population  --  artist-entrepreneurs . <p> The Bay Area has a higher percentage of people whose primary occupation is art , writing , music or performing than any other U.S. city except New York and Los Angeles , according to U.S. Census data compiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of those artists  --  43.8 percent  --  are self-employed . That group includes everything from fine-art photographers like Kiel to jewelry-makers , freelance writers , documentary filmmakers and wedding musicians . <p> They share the challenge of earning enough from their art to survive in this high-rent region . They also share the challenge of blending creative vision with business savvy  --  two skills that often are seen as diametrically opposed . <p> " The stereotype is that artists are flaky , artists ca n't function in the business world , and money corrupts creativity , " said Martha Zlatar , a San Francisco consultant who helps artists develop their work as a business . " The first thing I do with my clients is make them aware that those myths are not reality . " <p> About 31,000 people in San Francisco , Alameda , Contra Costa , San Mateo and Marin counties cited some kind of art as their primary occupation in the 2000 census , according to Markusen . That 's a relatively small number , just 1.2 percent of the employed population . <p> But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Markusen suggests that the number would be higher if it included people who view themselves as artists but make most of their income working in cubicles or cafes . <p> " There are probably twice as many people attempting to be artists and earning part of their living from it , than what we capture through the census , " she said . <p> Artists face a number of unique hurdles in making a living from their creative work . One of the first hurdles is psychological  --  a reluctance even to think of themselves as a business . <p> Historically , most arts education avoided any discussion of the business aspects of art . " When I went to art school in the early ' 70s , there was n't really anyone talking to students about business practices in the art world , " said Jeremy Stone , a San Francisco art appraiser and consultant . " There was a taboo against artists thinking of themselves as businesspeople . It was the old stereotype of ' You starve , you spend 20 years making art , then maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat , partly because art educators realize that most of their students will graduate with thousands of dollars of student loans . Even the fine art-focused San Francisco Art Institute now offers an elective in professional practices . <p> " I am probably seen on campus as the guy who stresses business too often , " said Holman Turner , a photographer who teaches at City College of San Francisco . " But most of the kids I work with at City College do n't have trust funds . They will leave school with loans they have to pay back . I feel a strong need to show them how to make a living . " <p> Another change in recent years is the Internet , which gives individual artists an unprecedented ability to market their work themselves . <p> " The Internet is a godsend , " said Cay Lang , an Emeryville photographer and author of " Taking the Leap : Building a Career as a Visual Artist . " <p> " Artists can reach their audience directly . If they want to , they can bypass galleries altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an entrepreneur will cause them to compromise their vision or sell out . Or they accept the stereotypes described by Zlatar  --  that as a creative person , they will automatically be inept at business . <p> So they are sometimes pleasantly surprised to find that business tasks can be fun and even creative . <p> " The major thing I learned is it 's all creative , it 's just a different medium , " said Jenn August , a 34-year-old singer and songwriter who is taking a business class at the Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center , a San Francisco nonprofit agency that trains small business owners . <p> August found she enjoys putting together a spreadsheet of her income and expenses . " I used to say yes to gigs because I wanted to perform , and then I would lose money , " August said . " Now I can punch the numbers in and say , ' Yes , I can afford to do this festival . ' " <p> Even artists like August who embrace entrepreneurship talk of the emotional challenge of shifting between their artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They end up frustrated when the time spent on marketing their art starts to crowd out the time needed to create it . <p> Lynne Willis , 40 , uses hand-cut linoleum block prints to create greeting cards and bookplates . She estimates that just 15 percent of her time goes into design . The rest goes into tasks like manufacturing , marketing and bookkeeping . " It 's pretty sad , " she said . <p> Willis sometimes feels torn between designing for the marketplace and designing for herself . <p> " The hard-headed businesswoman part of me says , ' Do designs for these particular occasions , these are the holes in your line , ' " Willis said . " Then when I start thinking about those restrictions , the creative part of me loses it and I ca n't think of anything . Because I spend so much time on the business end of things , I shut ( my creative side ) off . I have to find a balance between design I love and design I sell . " <p> More than most other kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they have produced . So selling their work  --  and the frequent rejection that is part of any sales effort  --  can be particularly daunting . <p> " The hardest thing is to pull the emotion out of this , " said August . " I put a lot of myself into my songs . Then I have to put on my business hat and be this neutral businessperson and cut the best deal I can . " <p> Kiel , the photographer , started out by taking a four-week class at the Renaissance Center called " So You Want to Start Your Own Business . " It helped him identify his target audience and price his work appropriately . <p> Kiel is great at talking with people one-on-one about his photos , richly colored Cibachrome images of flowers . But making cold calls to galleries and stores still terrifies him . To deal with the fear , he makes a list of about 10 venues to call and then jogs in place to build up enough adrenaline to feel confident . <p> " If I were selling software it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my body , " Kiel said . " When you 're creating something of your own and being told no , it 's really tough . I 'm getting better at the whole rejection aspect . But it still sucks . " <p> In a nod to the importance of the Bay Area 's artist population , some local economic development groups have developed business-training programs specifically for artists and performers . <p> The city of Oakland sponsors an annual small-business conference that includes arts-related workshops such as " Starting a Music Label " and " Grantwriting for Artists . " And the San Francisco office of the Small Business Administration hosts several classes each quarter on topics such as law or marketing for artists  --  one of the few , if not only , offices in the country to do so . <p> " We decided to do this because the arts are so important to our economy , " said Al Dixon , director of the San Francisco Small Business Development Center , which organizes the classes and provides free business consulting for artists . " Twenty percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts are part of what makes San Francisco so unique . " <p> Even with help from places like the Small Business Administration , the road to building a viable art business is often bumpy . Keren Peled , a San Rafael jewelry-maker who took a class to help turn her hobby into a business , recounted recent high and low points during one of her monthly consulting sessions with Zlatar . <p> On the high side : Peled 's delicate gold-wire necklaces were featured on HGTV . She took part in a charity crafts show that exposed her to hundreds of new potential customers . And she received a $400 order from a store in Illinois . <p> On the low side : Peled registered to take part in a fashion show that was canceled on the day it was supposed to take place . " We were supposed to be doing a fitting with the models that morning , but we showed up and the place was empty , " said Peled , 28 . " The organizers were n't there , there was no runway , nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a career as an actuarial analyst to make jewelry , still does math tutoring on the side to make ends meet . " If I 'm depending only on this for income , it stresses me out so much it takes the creative juices out of me , " she said . <p> Kiel also continues to rely on odd jobs like pet-sitting to supplement his photography income . But since taking that business class , he has increased his monthly photo sales from $200 to $1,500 . Kiel has no regrets . <p> " I want to do this full time , and I am willing to work my a  --  off to do it , " he said . " At least I am not working at the Gap or Starbucks . " <p> August aspires to earn $5,000 a month from her music someday . She 's nowhere near that right now . But she hopes that the marketing skills she 's learning will help her get there . <p> " Basically , I 'm trying to figure out how to be an artist-entrepreneur , with ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In reality , I 've probably created 10 different little companies within my company . I wrote a job description for myself and it included booker , promoter , songwriter , performer , administrator and janitor . <p> " I had a friend say , ' Is there anything you have n't done ? ' Yes , make money . But that 's next .
