London Late April , 1816 " Dear Deverell , of course I know exactly the right lady for you . " Head high , Audrey Deverell swayed back on the stool on which she was perched , narrowed her eyes at the canvas she was daubing , then delicately touched the tip of her brush to one spot . Apparently satisfied , she regained her equilibrium and looked down at the palette balanced on her arm . " I 'm only surprised it 's taken you so long to ask . " Seated in a well-cushioned wicker armchair beside the wide windows through which the afternoon sun washed across his aunt 's " studio , " Jocelyn Hubert Deverell , 7th Viscount Paignton , known to all as simply Deverell , watched Audrey select another hue to add to her creation -- a landscape featuring what he thought was supposed to be a single large oak . The last time he 'd visited , a mere few months ago , this room had been devoted to basket weaving . When he 'd been shown in and had discovered Audrey sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her long , thin frame swathed in a dun-colored smock with a black beret atop her brassy curls , he 'd had to fight a grin , one she , who took each of her outlandish pursuits absolutely seriously , would not have appreciated . His only paternal aunt , much younger than her threebrothers , of whom his father had been the eldest , Audrey was in her late forties . A determinedly confirmed spinster , she frequently pursued the outrageous . Nevertheless , being a Deverell and comfortably well-to-do , she remained an accepted member of the haut ton . Even though her more conventional friends , all long married , often displayed a certain jealousy over Audrey 's flamboyant freedom , she was much sought after , if nothing else to add color and verve to said matrons ' entertainments . Audrey 's audacious unconventionality had from his earliest years drawn Deverell to her ; he felt infinitely closer to her than to any of his other aunts -- three maternal and two by marriage . Consequently , now that he quite clearly needed the sort of assistance aunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he 'd turned . He had n't , however , expected quite such a definite answer . Caution made him hesitate , but recollection of his state made him ask , " This lady --  " " Is quite perfect in every way . She 's of excellent family , attractive and lively , suffers from no affliction , physical or mental , is well dowered , correctly and appropriately educated , and I can personally vouch for her understanding . " That last had him arching a brow . " A connection ? " Audrey flashed him a smile . " She 's one of my goddaughters . I have a small platoon of them . " She refocused on her painting . " Goodness knows why , but a multitude of my friends named me godparent to their offspring . I often wondered if they thought , childless as I am , that I should n't be allowed to escape the nurturing role entirely . " Deverell thought that only too likely . " This lady --  " " Will make you an outstanding wife . Trust me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I 've given the matter due thought . You 're thirty-two , and what with the title as well as the estates , you really must marry . Admittedly there are your uncles who could inherit after you , but as neither George nor Gisborne have sons of their own , that really is n't an acceptable alternative . " Pausing in her daubing , Audrey shot him a severe glance . " And the last thing any of us would wish is to see the estate revert to Prinny ! " " Indeed not . " The idea of the estates that , courtesy of the unexpected death of a cousin twice removed , had fallen into his lap reverting on his death to the Crown , and its licentious bearer , was one Deverell viewed with intense disfavor . He might not have expected to have to care for entailed estates , but now they were his , he 'd be damned if he let Prinny , or whoever succeeded him , get their greedy hands on them . Especially not now he 'd visited his new holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who tended them . Along with a title came responsibilities , and he 'd never been one to shirk such obligations , even if unlooked for . He was now Viscount Paignton ; as such he had to marry . " Quite aside from the matter of an heir --  " " There 's the social obligations , of course . " Audrey nodded sagely , her gaze still on her canvas . " Your wife must be able to manage your houses , and even more importantly manage the dinners , parties , balls , and so on that as Paignton you will have to attend . " He did n't try to hide his grimace . " If she could minimize the latter --  " " Do n't even think it , not until you 've been married for years . Then , perhaps , you might be allowed to slink off and hide in your library . Until that time , you 'll have to grit your teeth and stand by her side at all necessary functions . " Audrey threw him another strait glance . " Along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping you up to the mark -- ensuring you appear at all the functions you ought . " Deverell met Audrey 's glance levelly and inwardly wished his wife-to-be good luck . She 'd need it . " You seem to have a very clear vision of the qualities my wife should possess . " " Well , of course , dear . I 've known you from birth , and despite what you think , you are very like your father -- you have little time for artifice and none at all for fools . And after spending the last ten and more years being a spy in France , I imagine your prejudices have only become more fixed . Consequently the notion of you finding any degree of marital satisfaction with the general run of young ladies is utterly untenable . " She arched a brow at him . " I understand you 've been casting your eye over the herd . " " The ' herd ' appear to be henwitted flibbertigibbets with less sense than my horse . " Audrey grinned . " Quite . Well , there you are -- it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laying aside her palette , she reached for a rag ; sitting back , she started cleaning her brush . Continues ...
