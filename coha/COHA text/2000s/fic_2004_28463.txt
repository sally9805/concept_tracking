Chapter One The jangling of the telephone barely broke through Lieutenant Michael Gallagher 's haze of fatigue and exhaustion . But when the telephone kept ringing , one hand slid out from under the covers and snatched it up . " This better be good - very good - or you 're dead , " he snarled . " Gallagher , it 's Commander McKenna . " " Sir ? " Michael 's mind immediately snapped to attention at the sound of his commander 's voice . " Gallagher , did you snatch a toddler out of the path of a speeding truck yesterday afternoon ? " Yesterday afternoon ? Rubbing a hand over his darkly stubbled face , Michael swore under his breath . The stress from working under-cover for six months trying to close down a major drug-dealing operation had taken its toll . He was exhausted and nearly burned out . He could barely remember his name let alone what had happened yesterday . Yesterday seemed a million miles and memories away . Frantically , he tried to think , to remember what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His suspects were in custody , his reports were done and he 'd headed home for his first decent night 's sleep in six months . Then he remembered the toddler . And almost swore again . " Yes , sir . " Michael had to clear histhroat . " I did . The mother was distracted . Talking on her cell phone . The kid just darted into the street after his ball . I happened to be standing right there , saw what was happening and reached the kid before anyone else could . It was no big deal , sir . " " That 's where you 're wrong , Gallagher . Apparently , the press thinks it 's a very big deal . Your picture is all over the front page of every major newspaper in Chicago . " " What ? " Michael said , bolting upright in bed . " Your picture , it 's all over the papers this morning , " the commander repeated with waning patience . " A reporter just happened to be passing by and captured you in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I 've got a very nosy reporter cooling her heels in my outer office wanting an exclusive interview with Chicago 's latest hero cop . You 've been dubbed the Sexiest Cop In The City , Gallagher . " " Damn , " Michael growled , gripping the receiver tighter and shaking his head in mortification . " My sentiments exactly , Detective . " It was n't hard to hear the derision in his commander 's voice . " Gallagher , I 'm sorry , but I 've got no choice . I 'm putting you on thirty days ' mandatory leave - with pay - effective immediately . " The commander ignored Michael 's sputtering protests . " Maybe by then , this story will die down and the press will lose interest in you . I ca n't have one of my best undercover cops compromised by having his face splashed all over every damn newspaper in the city . It could jeopardize your life as well as any investigation you 're involved in . " " But - " " Thirty days ' leave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant . Understand ? " " I understand , " Michael said grimly , dragging a hand through his black hair . " And Gallagher , do us all a favor . Get outta town . This reporter is not going to stop digging until she gets what she wants . I figure you might have thirty , maybe forty-five , minutes before she tracks you down at home . I want you far away and out of her reach until all this nonsense dies down , do you hear me ? " " I hear you , I hear you . " Michael snapped the covers back and was already dragging his weary body out of bed . He reached for his jeans , still crumpled in a heap where he 'd stepped out of them yesterday . " I 'll see you in thirty-one days . " " Yes , sir , " Michael said glumly , as he stepped barefoot into his jeans , dragged them up and did up his zipper . " Oh , and Gallagher ? " " Sir ? " " Try to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until then . " After spending nearly ten minutes muttering vicious imprecations about the Chicago press under his breath , Michael stuffed some clothes into a duffel bag and grabbed his laptop and the file of scrawled notes he 'd been accumulating for almost ten years . Then he called his family to tell them what had happened and that he was heading out of town on vacation until the heat from the press died down . Not that they would n't know . As the eldest son in a family of seven , he and his five brothers and one sister were incredibly close . Considering all his brothers were either Chicago cops or firemen , no doubt they 'd all seen the morning papers . It was a good thing he was getting out of town , Michael decided with a grim smile as he frowned up at the pewter sky before shoving his duffel bag and laptop into the back seat of his vintage Mustang . Otherwise , he 'd never live down the razzing from his brothers and sister . Sexiest Cop In The City , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazily from the cloudy sky as he pulled into the busy afternoon traffic . He had n't a clue where he was going . He was too tired to think , but the last thing he wanted was a confrontation with the press . So Michael drove along the busy city streets and then onto the interstate . Somewhere between the Illinois and Wisconsin borders , the wind picked up and the clouds in the sky shifted and darkened , dropping more flakes of fat , fluffy snow . With the radio tuned in to a station softly playing oldies and the bucolic countryside rolling by , Michael let his thoughts drift and finally felt some of his inner tension ease . Months of undercover work had taken their toll . Living on the edge , burrowing himself deep in the drug underground , always watching over his shoulder and always worrying about having his cover blown or his life taken had left him bone weary of the rat race of lies and deceit . He loved being a cop . It was a Gallagher family tradition . His grandfather had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his father had been killed in the line of duty when Michael was barely eleven - so it had always been expected that as the eldest son in the family , he would join the force as well , which he 'd dutifully done . But he 'd always harbored another dream , a secret dream he 'd never had the courage to talk about or admit to anyone . ( Continues ... )
