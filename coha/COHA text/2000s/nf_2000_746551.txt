Section : COVER STORY/THE CENTURY In a nation obsessed with lists , the trials that have shaped the law are more patterns for the future than rankings of the past <p> American courtrooms have long been stages for some of the nation 's greatest dramatic performances , and the murder trial of Harry K. Thaw was no exception . <p> When Thaw , the wayward son of a Pennsylvania industrialist , shot prominent architect Stanford White before dozens of theatergoers dining on the rooftop terrace of Madison Square Garden , . the subsequent trial became one of the most publicized events of the time . <p> It had everything a made-for-the-tabloids affair could hope for : sex , money , jealousy , gambling , abuse , even a chorus girl and a red velvet swing . <p> By all accounts , it was the Trial of the Century . Of course , the year was 1907 , and the century had only begun . It would be nearly two decades before John T. Scopes would stand trial for teaching Darwinism , almost 30 years before Bruno Hauptmann would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Charles Lindbergh , and the better part of a century before O.J. Simpson would grimace as he struggled to pull on a glove in a Los Angeles courtroom . <p> For the past 99 years , hardly a decade has passed without at least one high-profile case being promoted as the Trial of the Century . Yet while the issues and accusations of those trials varied , what made them riveting courtroom dramas-wealth , power , social conflict  --  is timeless . <p> From the early part of the century to its final year , these cases have revealed the nation 's fascination with the Achilles ' heels of American folk heroes and celebrities , exposed the debilitating impact of racial hatred on society , highlighted society 's efforts to absorb advances in science and technology , and illuminated the dark side of the quest for success and fortune . <p> In many ways , the Trial of the 20th Century is a classification rather than a single event . For every trial that dramatically defined the law in one decade , a subsequent one has echoed its story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Fallen Stars <p> From the shots Harry Thaw pumped into Stanford White to O.J. Simpson 's televised odyssey down a San Diego freeway , the media has defined , and often exploited , these dramas . <p> " Just as a celebrity is someone famous for being famous , a great trial of the century is famous for being famous , " says historian Edward Knappman , editor of the book Great American Trials . " It is defined by the amount of public attention it gets . " <p> The media frenzy surrounding the 1935 murder trial of Bruno Hauptmann in Flemington , N.J. , was unparalleled for its time . Hundreds of newspaper and radio reporters swarmed to the small East Coast city to cover the stow about the man accused of kidnapping and murdering the child of one of America 's greatest heroes . The largest telephone system for a single event was installed just to accommodate the needs of the media . <p> The public could n't get enough . Crowds lined the sidewalks to vie for seating to witness the trial , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside the courthouse , vendors hawked autographed photos and memorabilia of the trial . <p> Six decades later , the nation witnessed a similar phenomenon . Television brought home the murder trial of football legend Simpson . Satellite dishes and live remotes transformed the trial into a multimedia event of the grandest proportions , and the world sat down and watched . <p> More than 100 news agencies , 20 TV companies and 1,000 correspondents covered the trial at the world 's entertainment capital . T-shirts and bumper stickers were sold outside the courthouse , and bus trips provided guided tours of the murder scene . <p> Hauptmann 's trial would not have attracted the attention it did if the child who was kidnapped and later found dead was not the son of a national hero . Similarly , the sensationalism of the Simpson case was triggered by the fall of a sports legend , not the brutal slayings of two innocents . <p> It is the position in which society holds the rich and famous that makes tragedies involving them so fascinating , says Samuel A. Guiberson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timothy McVeigh on charges of bombing a federal office building in Oklahoma City . <p> " Our celebrities are aristocrats in the way we relate to them . It 's difficult to conceive of the rich and famous as being victims , and the fascination with that is the perception of whether it was their celebrity or wealth that somehow brought them to this pain , " Guiberson says . <p> History may not have curbed the media 's appetite for courtroom drama . But the massive growth in news coverage since the Hauptmann trial has sparked growing concern about the nation 's ability to balance its commitment to the concepts of fair trial and free press . <p> While in the Lindbergh case the victim 's fame raised questions about the defendant 's ability to get a fair trial , in the Simpson case it was the defendant 's celebrity that challenged the justice system . <p> " The threat is that the public attention politicizes the process and the outcome becomes larger than the case itself , " Guiberson says . " It 's a real challenge to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is watching . " Courting Social Justice <p> When celebrities are n't involved , however , it sometimes takes the watchful eyes of the public to monitor the justice system . <p> The nine black youths known simply as the Scottsboro Boys have come to symbolize the vigilantism of parts of the South in the early 1930s . <p> When the deputy sheriff of Scottsboro , Ala. , charged the young men with raping two white girls , who later admitted lying to hide their prostitution , the news prompted a mob of several hundred to storm the jail seeking to avenge the girls ' honor . <p> The mob was held at bay , but the series of trials that followed the 1931 arrests initially resulted in death sentences for all but one of the defendants . Although the sentences were later reduced after a series of new trials and appeals , it was 1937 before the trials finally ended . <p> The charges against five of the defendants were dropped , but all the others ended up with sentences in excess of 20 years . One was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prison in 1948 . Only one , Clarence Norris , was pardoned  --  by Alabama Gov . George C. Wallace in 1976 , when Norris was 64 . <p> Today the Scottsboro trials serve as a chilling reminder of prejudice and racial hatred . <p> " Its effect was more in awakening the consciousness of a great many Americans who were not paying attention to race relations since the end of Reconstruction , " says James Goodman , a Rutgers University history professor who is the author of the book Stories of Scottsboro . <p> " In some ways it was one of a number of events that contributed to a revival of a civil rights movement that white people as well as black people were involved in , " Goodman says . <p> The American justice system has changed dramatically since the days of the Scottsboro Boys . The trials themselves resulted in two landmark decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court . Powell v. Alabama ( 1932 ) marked the first time the Court addressed the 14th Amendment right to counsel for indigent defendants . In Norris v. Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of blacks from juries violated the equal protection clause . <p> Other legal decisions outside the criminal context also have helped precipitate needed changes in civil rights . Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) and other cases like it helped desegregate schools . And the civil rights movement in general , as well as the 1964 Civil Rights Act , established mechanisms for victims of racial discrimination to seek redress from the government . <p> While the law now provides a means for fighting the effects of prejudice and discrimination , society has been unable to eradicate racism , and race continues to play a role in the way justice is handed out . <p> " Because there are so many Scottsboros , black people are incredibly suspicious of the justice system , " Goodman says . " The law and society are not always together with one another , and they wo n't be until prejudice disappears . " <p> The justification for those concerns crystallized in 1993 when an 81-second amateur videotape captured a group of white Los Angeles police officers kicking and beating a heavyset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the assault carried with it haunting reminders of vigilante attacks in the days of Scottsboro . <p> What had changed dramatically , however , was that laws were in place to respond to it . Unlike the Scottsboro case , it was the police officers in the King case who were forced to answer for their actions . And , rightly or wrongly , when they were acquitted of state charges , they still had to answer for their actions under federal laws . <p> Yet the riots that erupted after the officers ' acquittal in the criminal trials show , at minimum , that many still perceive that the justice system fails to protect all people equally . <p> " In Scottsboro , the African-American defendants could not get justice in the courts . They were not taken seriously , " Goodman says . " In Rodney King , the people were so furious with the acquittals they felt there was no justice . What ties them together is the belief that there is no justice for African-Americans in the courts , and that there is not equal justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those involving the Scottsboro Boys and Rodney King continue to resonate in the American psyche for reasons that go beyond the facts of the cases themselves . <p> " Part of the reason cases become trials of the century is that they distill and condense conflicts that are in the world , " Goodman says . " The resolution of the trial is not the resolution of the conflict , but it is one of the ways we work these things out . " The Law Confronts Science <p> The search for answers to the conflicts of the day has prompted the courts to intervene in some unlikely matters . <p> In some cases it was the occurrence of an event that forced the courtroom confrontation . In others , such as the famous Scopes " monkey " trial , it was the desire for debate that prompted staging of the drama . <p> When John T. Scopes taught a 1925 lesson on evolutionary theory to his high school science class in Dayton , Tenn. , he not only triggered a national debate over the origins of humans but forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be used . <p> The trial  --  pitting the Bible 's teachings of creationism against Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution , not to mention the legal mind of three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan against that of renowned defense attorney Clarence Darrow  --  established a precedent for using courts as a forum to reconcile advances in science and technology with existing laws and social mores . <p> Fifty years later , cases such as that of Karen Ann Quinlan  --  whose family helped trigger the right-to-die movement by fighting to have their comatose daughter taken off life support  --  continued to make demands on the courts to resolve philosophical and ethical questions that often go beyond the scope of the law . <p> While the Scopes and Quinlan cases represent the conflicts that arise when the law can not keep up with scientific advances , they also illustrate society 's need to find answers to questions that may not exist . <p> " There is a tendency we have as Americans to turn all issues into legal proceedings , " says Michal Belknap , a professor at California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book American Political Trials . <p> " We seem to have gotten into the habit of ramming all kinds of debates into a trial format , " Belknap adds . <p> The dilemmas created by an ever-broadening foundation of scientific and technological knowledge continue . Medical advances have challenged courts to address issues such as birth control , abortion and surrogacy . <p> Yet developments in those areas  --  " morning after " pills , improved prenatal care and new artificial reproductive technology  --  are threatening the ability of those rulings to endure . <p> The greatest difficulty of such cases may be that courts , in response to scientific advances , often are asked to resolve moral conflicts that occur when science and fundamental spiritual beliefs can not reconcile . <p> " What some people say about the law is that it is one step behind , " says George Annas , a professor of bioethics and the law at Boston University School of Law . <p> " In one sense it is , but in a real sense it does n't have to be as long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is just trying to react . " Trying Times for Big Business <p> The law does n't always fail to keep up with changing times . In some ways , the law 's ability to remain steadfast reflects on how little the underlying conflicts confronting society have changed . It is a phenomenon familiar to big business . <p> From the Industrial Revolution to the computer age , the great American business leaders have been simultaneously admired and despised . <p> John D. Rockefeller 's success in founding the Standard Oil Co. made him the richest man in the world during the early part of the century . But while he was revered for his business savvy and charitable works , his winner-take-all business tactics that shut out would-be competitors tainted his reputation and made much of society skeptical about the legitimacy of his wealth and his manner of acquiring it . <p> Similarly , Bill Gates , the richest man in the world today , is being challenged for his success in building his Microsoft computer empire . Although his genius and business skills have won him admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned  --  as Rockefeller 's were  --  as predatory and monopolistic . <p> " The issue is are they being punished for their success or did they get there by means foul ? " says Shane Greenstein , a computer and telecommunications market analyst and a professor at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill . <p> Standard Oil and Microsoft both were subjected to trials challenging their efforts to control their markets . The courts were to determine whether their founders were robber barons or merely captains of industry . While the two cases differ in terms of the type of product and extent of control , the foundations for resolving these issues  --  the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and other federal antitrust regulations  --  were very much the same . <p> Standard Oil became one of the first targets of the Sherman Act in the early 1900s . The federal government attacked the corporation based on the theory that Rockefeller and his partners conspired to limit trade and commerce in oil markets through price-fixing and other restraints on trade . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissolve the oil trust during a time when the Sherman Act was increasingly being challenged by big business enterprises that claimed it was designed to benefit competitors . <p> Since then , the federal antitrust doctrines have undergone repeated refinement in the courts . But nearly 90 years later , the same legal issues are at the heart of the government 's case against Microsoft . <p> " Standard Oil was groundbreaking because the antitrust act had hardly been used , whereas now there is a ton of precedent out there , " Greenstein says . " Although the specifics of Microsoft are very interesting , it makes the legal , case less interesting . " A Trying Future <p> While it is the characters and events surrounding a trial that attract the public 's attention , it is more than mere drama that gives a case lasting significance . <p> In the end , be it questions about the legitimacy of how fortunes are made , the right of a person to live without the assistance of a machine or the mere intrigue about what caused the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the search for answers that gives them lasting significance . <p> " There are so many circumstances under which these cases develop , " says George Anastaplo , a professor of constitutional history at Loyola University School of Law in Chicago . <p> " It may be society wants an answer and a trial is one way of learning the truth , or it may be we are just naturally a political people who are legalistically minded , " he says . <p> But what will the new century bring ? Will the dramatic elements of conflict , culminating actions and resolution that have provided the structure for some of the great courtroom performances of the last century continue to dictate the high-profile cases of the future ? Will the controversies involving the Internet , human cloning , affirmative action and Bill Clinton 's sex life be the impetus for the trials of the next century ? <p> If the 20th century says anything about what is to come , the courtroom shows of the 21st century no doubt will be characterized by a similar dramatic structure . The leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and social status . The conflicts will surely involve effects of technology or human frailty . And ultimately , the denouement will come from a judge 's finding or a jury verdict .
