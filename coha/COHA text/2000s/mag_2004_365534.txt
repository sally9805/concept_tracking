WHEN KEIS ISITFAN headed home from work one recent night , he had reason to watch his back . As a laundry worker for the U.S. embassy inside Baghdad 's green zone , he risked being attacked by insurgents targeting Iraqis who work for the U.S. But there was another source of anxiety : Isitfan , 27 , is a Christian and , like others of his faith , is facing growing hostility from hard-line Islamic groups who accuse Christians of being sympathetic to the Western occupiers . <P> As Isitfan was driving home on Sept. 7 , his worst fears came true . After he left the green zone , two cars pulled up alongside , and attackers inside opened fire . Four bullets hit Isitfan , who died on the street . His family , convinced Isitfan was killed for his faith , plans to flee the country . " Christians in Iraq are weak , " says his sister Layla , a translator for the U.S. embassy . " All they can do is leave here , like we will do . " <P> Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein 's regime , according to Christian groups in Baghdad . Although Christians make up only about 3% of Iraq 's 25 million people , the U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees has said they account for about 20% of the refugees fleeing Iraq for Syria . They are escaping a climate of violence and a surging Islamic radicalism that have made the practice of their faith a deadly enterprise . <P> The worst moment came on Aug. 1 when Islamic insurgents  --  most likely connected with terrorist leader Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi , according to Iraqi government officials  --  attacked five churches in Baghdad and Mosul with car bombs , killing a dozen people . While Muslim authorities in Iraq widely condemned those attacks , local Christians say security has continued to deteriorate . Says Layla Isitfan : " If I ca n't go to church because I 'm scared , if I ca n't dress how I want , if I ca n't drink because it 's against Islam , what kind of freedom is that ? " <P> Like the larger insurgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign against Christians appears to be becoming more organized . Sa'ad Jusif , a Chaldean-Assyrian Christian , was kidnapped on Sept. 8 , according to Dr. Munir Mardirosian , who heads a political party for Armenian Catholics in Baghdad . His captors showed him a list of 200 names , most of them Christian , and demanded to know where they lived . When he refused , he was hung from the ceiling and beaten with iron pipes . He was released only when his family paid a $50,000 ransom on Sept. 13 . He left the next day for Jordan . Says Mardirosian : " If they opened the doors to America or Australia , I can say there would not be one Christian left in Iraq . " <P> The violence in Iraq threatens one of the world 's oldest Christian communities , dating back 2,000 years . The population includes Chaldean Assyrians ( Eastern-rite Catholics who recognize the Pope 's authority ) ; Assyrians , who form an independent church ; Syrian Catholics ; and Armenian Catholics . Under Saddam , Christians coexisted more or less amicably with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television , and Christians were allowed to own and operate liquor stores .
