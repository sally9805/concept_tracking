<p> Handsome Family , Nora O'Connor <p> 10 tonight <p> Schubas , 3159 N. Southport <p> Cover , $ 8 <p> ( 773 ) 525-2508 <p> The Handsome Family has traveled a long way since the days of goofy tunes about ponies and baloney and live shows that were closer to performance art than music . <p> With 1997 's " Through the Trees , " the group pared down to the husband-and-wife duo of guitarist-vocalist Brett and bassist-lyricist Rennie Sparks . They also unleashed a poignant masterpiece that qualifies as one of the most striking albums produced by Chicago 's thriving alternative-country scene . <p> The Sparks have topped themselves again with " In the Air , " their fourth album , due to arrive in stores on Valentine 's Day . It 's a more uplifting effort , and one that highlights the group 's strengths : Brett 's classic , old-time country baritone ; Rennie 's literate and sharply written lyrics , and a burgeoning flair for spartan but beautifully crafted arrangements . <p> I spoke to the couple on the eve of the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to their widest audience yet . <p> Q. The new album strikes me as a much straighter record ; the gonzo is still in there , but it 's buried a little deeper . <p> Rennie : Well , we 're in a lot of therapy . And the medication ca n't hurt . <p> Brett : I think it 's a bit more radio-friendly . ( Laughs ) It is a little toned down , but I do n't know why , it just came out that way . It 's the titles too : " Through the Trees " and " In the Air , " one 's kind of dark , one kind of is n't . <p> Rennie : " Through the Trees " was supposed to be happy , too , but things do n't always turn out the way you planned them to . <p> Q. You 're joking about it , but are you guys generally in a better frame of mind these days ? <p> Rennie : I think I was definitely a lot more on the edge the last time around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to make myself feel better and not worse . <p> Brett : Last year was really good for us in terms of the band thing . We got a lot of positive feedback from people all over the world , and we got to travel a lot . We quit our jobs . That kind of leads us to have a little bit of  --  I wo n't say a rosier outlook , but better . <p> Q. For me , all of " Through the Trees " was colored by " My Ghost , " the song about Brett 's nervous breakdown . And that 's the sort of intensely personal and cathartic song you can only do once . <p> Rennie : Right ; I would n't really want to do that again . You 'd end up shooting yourself in the head eventually . <p> Brett : Actually , I thought that song was funny , to tell you the truth . I wrote this hard-hitting set of lyrics , and Rennie was like , " These lyrics ( stink ) , they 're too literal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only write lyrics for about one song per album , and then she rewrites them ? <p> Brett : I do n't even want one song per album . I do n't like to write lyrics . It 's not my thing , man . <p> Rennie : His handwriting 's terrible ; it 's better if I do it . <p> Brett : Most bands are basically an adversarial relationship between three or four people . Our situation is different . <p> Rennie : I do n't write the lyrics secretly wishing that I could be the one to sing them . I write them for him . <p> Brett : It 's more of an abstraction . We do n't write specifically autobiographical material either , like Jeff ( Tweedy ) writes . It 's a different kind of approach . <p> Q. If you were writing lyrics for yourself to sing , would they be different , Rennie ? <p> Rennie : I 'd probably write all these songs about bunnies dressed up like sailors or something horrible like that . ( Laughs ) I have all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's different . It 's from a female point of view . <p> Brett : Rennie 's solo project is that she has a book of short stories ( Evil ) coming out in March or April . <p> Q. With new tunes like " Do n't Be Scared , " " The Sad Milkman " and " A Beautiful Thing , " you 're really concentrating on these evocative story-songs , and it seems to me you 've made a quantum leap forward in the way the music and the stories are merging . <p> Brett : I 've given the record to friends , and people have said the words and the music seem a lot more seamless than before . It never occurred to me ; I think it just comes from working together . We 've been collaborating seriously since the end of " Milk and Scissors , " trying to be the Gilbert and Sullivan of alt-country , or the Bernie Taupin and Elton John . <p> Rennie : ( Laughs ) Oh , God ! <p> Q. How about the Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you think about recording this one at a studio instead of in your living room ? <p> Brett : ( Dave Trumfio and Ken Sluiter of King Size Studio ) encouraged me to do it myself and discouraged me from going into the studio . They 've been doing that ever since we did the " Invisible Hands " EP , which was spotty recording-wise because it was the first thing that I ever did for commercial release , and I did it all by myself at home on eight tracks . Dave helped me mix " Through the Trees , " but this time he was like , " You can really just do this yourself . You 're wasting money spending all these days in the studio . " <p> Rennie : The reason we were there was more to have somebody tell us we were doing the right thing . Maybe it was time to just grow up . <p> Q. You 've had a long relationship with Carrot Top Records , which is one of the better but less-heralded indie labels around town . <p> Brett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up to us and said , " You guys are great , I 'd like to make a record . " This is when we were so bad we could barely get through six or seven songs ; we were playing at Phyllis ' and those wonderful places . He put our record out and it 's grown into a really great relationship . We do exactly what we want and it 's a profit split , really fair and no underhanded ( nonsense ) . I 've just had so many people over the last years who had these horrible major-label stories . <p> Rennie : There 's so much pressure on you to do what they want : ' Where 's the hit ? Why do n't you lose weight ? Why do n't you get this haircut ? ' I just do n't want people editing every aspect of what we do . People think you ca n't do anything but treat it like a hobby if you 're on an indie label , but we 're doing OK . <p> Brett : We treat it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , we run our own Web site , we answer our own mail . We do our art for the CD . I reserved all the hotels for the tour . . . . <p> Rennie : People wan na be like kids and just be taken care of by someone . <p> Brett : Bands go to tour Germany and they hire a tour manager and a big huge van and they come home broke and ask , ' What happened with all that money ? ' Well , you should have toured in a Fiat by yourself ! <p> Q. Does the hard work ever take a toll on your marriage ? <p> Rennie : It 's better than temping downtown ! <p> Brett : We 're basically touring from now through July , and by the end of that , I wo n't even want to hear music or think about it . <p> Rennie : We 'll just want to take sleeping pills , sit in the dark and watch TV . Touring is n't glamorous at all . You 're tired and dirty and grimy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to do because it 's so wonderful to feel connected to these people in different cities all over the world . In my old life , I was this reclusive , socially phobic person who could n't communicate with anyone , and it 's wonderful to feel like you 're part of a community .
