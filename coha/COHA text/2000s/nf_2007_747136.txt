The American School Counselor Association has developed the ASCA National Modelr in order to provide school counselors with a structure for effective practice . The ASCA National Model can help school counselors think proactively about how they can best serve the students in their schools , and it contains ideas and tools for developing comprehensive school counseling programs that use the current best practices in the field . This article briefly summarizes the ASCA National Model and uses the model to identify effective program components for addressing student transitions . <p> Students experience significant transitions of various types throughout their educational journey , and school counselors have often been instrumental in helping them make the shifts successfully . Increasingly it is clear that in order to serve all students effectively , we must think proactively and systemically about what actions to take during these key times . The ASCA National Model : A Framework for School Counseling Programs ( American School Counselor Association , 2005 ) , written by Judy Bowers and Trish Hatch , provides a useful structure for thinking about how to develop school counseling programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ASCA National Modelr builds on the solid foundations of the Comprehensive Developmental Guidance Model ( Gysbers &; Henderson , 2000 ) , the Results-Based Model ( Johnson &; Johnson , 1997 , 2001 ) , and the National Standards ( Campbell &; Dahir , 1997 ; Dahir , Sheldon , &; Valiga , 1998 ) . It was specifically developed to address the growing need for standardization and accountability in school counseling programs . While there are tremendous variations in schools and student populations , school counseling programs can share many elements . This article uses the ASCA National Model as a structure to suggest the program components that school counselors can put into practice in order to create successful transitions for all students . THE ASCA NATIONAL MODEL <p> According to the ASCA National Model , a school counseling program is " comprehensive in scope , preventative in design and developmental in nature " ( ASCA , 2005 , p. 13 ) . A comprehensive school counseling program strives to help all students pre-K through 12th grade achieve success in school through preventive education contained in guidance curricula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ASCA National Model school counseling programs have four components : the foundation , the delivery system , the management system , and the accountability system . The foundation is the basis of the model , and it addresses the philosophical underpinnings of the school counseling program . It consists of concise , thoughtful statements about beliefs , program philosophy , and mission and is linked to the mission and goals of the school . The foundation also contains information about the expected student competencies that school counseling programs will address in the academic , career , and personal/ social domains ( Campbell &; Dahir , 1997 ) . <p> The delivery system includes guidance curricula , individual student planning , responsive services ( e.g. , counseling , referral , consultation ) , and systems support ( e.g. , collaboration , program management , professional development ) . The management systems are the systemic monitoring processes that ensure the implementation of the program . This includes contracts or agreements with administrators about responsibilities and program implementation , action plans , calendars , data use , and advisory councils . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program audits that measure and communicate with stakeholders about program results and related data . <p> In addition to describing the program foundation and systems for delivery , management , and accountability , the ASCA National Model integrates the Education Trust 's ( 2002 ) Transforming School Counseling Initiative themes of leadership , advocacy , collaboration , and systemic change . The ASCA National Model encourages school counselors to focus on academic success and to promote equity and access to educational resources for all students . The ASCA National Model and Transitioning into Elementary School <p> Foundation . Kindergarten is usually the start of formal education for children in public schools and is , thus , a significant transition period . The foundation of an elementary school counseling program can formally state that the program 's goals include orienting and connecting with incoming kindergarten students and their families in order to facilitate school engagement and feelings of membership . Program mission statements and belief statements can be linked to school and district goals in order to affirm the value of creating building-wide , consistent school structures and policies that help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Delivery system . When developmental guidance standards , competencies , and indicators are in place , the school counselor 's role in enhancing the learning process is clear . School counselors can spend time in each kindergarten classroom introducing themselves , talking about what they do in a developmentally appropriate manner , and communicating to students that counselors are supportive members of the learning community . As early as is feasible , school counselors also can implement curriculum units that reinforce the teachers ' efforts to create community ensure emotional safety , and promote learning . When school counselors provide elementary students with tools for learning , their academic achievement and social competence increase ( Brigman &; Webb , 2003 ; Whiston &; Sexton , 1998 ) , their achievement test scores go up ( Sink &; Stroh , 2003 ) , and their school behavior improves ( Gerler , 1985 ) . <p> Students ' social skills can be improved with a guidance curriculum that develops multicultural understanding ( D'Andrea &; Daniels , 1995 ) . Counselors who have consistent expectations for student behavior and who encourage prosocial relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flannery et al. , 2003 ; Greenberg , Kusche , Cook , &; Quamma , 1995 ) . Counselors also can provide important support for kindergarten teachers in identifying new students ' unique learning styles and educational needs through classroom behavioral observation and consultation . <p> Every delivery system component can specifically address the unique needs of incoming kindergartners . School counselors can develop brochures that describe the counseling program services , and information can be presented on a school Web site . In a school with small ratios , school counselors can hold brief family meetings with incoming families over the course of the first few months in order to get to know the students and their families more personally and to communicate about the school counselor role in the school . Presentations at open houses and parent nights are a crucial and efficient way to let families know about school counseling program components and services , particularly in schools with larger caseloads . <p> Several curricula designed to facilitate academic and social-emotional skills in elementary students have been empirically evaluated and shown to have a significant impact on student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the most widely used interventions is the Second Step Program ( Frey &; Sylvester , 1997 ; Grossman et al. , 1997 ) , which has a well-researched impact on student behaviors . Programs such as the PATHS program ( Greenberg et al. , 1995 ) , the Student Success Skills curriculum ( Brigman &; Campbell , 2003 ) , and Anger Coping ( Lochman , Lampron , Gemmer , Harris , &; Wyckoff , 1989 ) can improve student achievement and social competence and can positively impact student transitions ( Lord , Eccles , &; McCarthy , 1994 ) . <p> Management and accountability systems . The management system helps to ensure thoughtful , intentional school counseling services for all students . In order to avoid the common pitfall of constantly reacting to immediate crises , school counseling programs at the elementary level need specific written agreements between counselors and administrators about the concrete implementation of school counseling programs . The answers to questions such as " Who will deal with a crisis when the counselor is in the classroom ? " and " What amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one-to-one counseling ? " are best dealt with ahead of time , so that there are clear expectations about the roles and functions of the school counselors in the building . Communicating with teachers and families about what is shifting and what the program goals and mission are can help case the challenge of change ( ASCA , 2005 ) . <p> The ASCA National Model suggests that programs have an advisory council that is made up of a broad range of community representatives from both within and outside the schools . The advisory council advises and assists with district-wide school counseling program development and improvement ( ASCA , 2005 ) . During the transitional stages of moving to an ASCA National Model program , advisory councils can provide invaluable support and information about the needs of the diverse stakeholders who are impacted by the school counseling program . Consulting with advisory councils about the unique needs of students during transitions can provide counselors with knowledge , resources , and information they might not otherwise have . <p> A crucial component of ASCA National Model school counseling programs is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change within school systems . Gathering general information about incoming students generates baseline data that then can be used to understand when and how problems emerge and which prevention efforts and interventions have a positive impact ( Dimmitt , 2003 ) . Promoting school-wide procedures for tracking attendance and discipline events allows school counselors to have access to important achievement-related data that can facilitate program decisions and more effectively meet the needs of students . <p> School counseling programs that effectively use data to determine program components , measure student learning , monitor the impact of interventions , and inform stakeholders about the impact of the work being done have the accountability system components essentially in place . Ensuring that students , parents , teachers , and administrators all know the many ways that the school counseling program is supporting and promoting student success creates program accountability and future viability . The ASCA National Model and Transitioning into Middle School <p> While there are still some students in K-12 schools in the United States , most children will transition from an elementary school into a junior high or middle school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a number of student developmental changes , including cognitive shifts to formal operations and puberty , that impact this transition ( Simmons &; Blyth , 1987 ) . Ideally , school districts have transition teams with school counselors , teachers , parents , and administrators working together to promote successful transitions at all levels ( Akos , 2003 ) . Whether or not such a team exists , school counselors are necessarily key players in any transition process . Elementary school counselors and middle school counselors can work together to help students effectively transition to middle school or junior high . In addition to developing student skills through classroom and counseling interventions , elementary school counselors can facilitate the middle school transition by sharing what they know , following ethical standards for confidentiality , about the needs of individual students with counselors and teachers in the receiving school . Knowledge about significant events that have shaped a cohort , such as the death of a parent of one of the children , can help middle school counselors be proactive in their services for a group of students . <p> Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multiple needs of transitioning students . Foundation components that specifically address the significance of the move from elementary to middle school help focus efforts on the distinctive set of challenges that this transition entails . A preventative and developmentally responsive school counseling program uses classroom and grade-wide interventions that specifically target the needs of transitioning students at both the elementary and secondary levels . One of the best ways to ensure that the school counseling program is serving all students is for counselors to be part of school leadership teams ( ASCA , 2005 ) , curriculum development committees , and other groups that determine school-wide policy and mission . <p> Delivery system . A district transition plan with yearlong components based on evidence-based practice , local needs , and school resources is the ideal ( Akos , 2003 ) . In the spring before the transition occurs , elementary school counselors can collaborate with middle school counselors and administrators to provide grade-wide or classroom-based information about the structure and schedule of the new school , and they can arrange for tours and orientation to the building and teachers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two earlier than returning students for orientation in the fall . School counselors laced to be a central component of these orientations , as this contact facilitates students ' connection to counseling services and makes timely self-referral at the middle school level more likely . <p> Family orientations to the new settings  --  including information about academic expectations , homework , and disciplinary processes  --  can all improve student transitions at the middle school level ( Lord et al. , 1994 ) . When academic and behavioral expectations are clearly communicated and consistently reinforced in multiple contexts ( classroom , school , home ) , academic success is more likely ( McDermott , Mordell , &; Stoltzfus , 2001 ) . Open houses and other times that families come to schools are always important opportunities for school counselors to communicate with the community about their role and function . Increasingly , counselors also are using Web sites and e-mail to introduce the school counseling program and to provide crucial information to parents and incoming students ( Carey &; Dimmitt , in press ) . Posting master calendars of guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about available services , and it allows stakeholders to concretely see evidence of the work that school counselors are doing . <p> Middle school counselors have a unique challenge each fall as new students enter their school . With increased academic expectations , room and schedule changes , and a larger student body , middle schools are often quite different from elementary schools in several key ways . However , students with a positive self-concept and good peer relationships report more successful middle school transitions ( Lord et al. , 1994 ; McDougall &; Hymel , 1998 ) . School counselors can assist students by providing social skills and friendship groups for students who are deemed at risk for problematic transitioning . <p> Just as elementary school counselors focus initial efforts on acclimating kindergarten students , middle school counselors can best serve their population by providing entering students with orientation to the school counseling program and services , and by connecting with families and students through parent nights , newsletters , brochures , classroom presentations , and family meetings . The goal of providing services for all students and their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle school , students ideally will have a sense of who school counselors are and what their school function is , but it is valuable to communicate clearly with students , families , school personnel , and community members about what services and support the school counseling program provides . In districts where there are not school counselors at the elementary level , orientation to the role and function of school counselors at the secondary level can enhance service provision . <p> At the middle school level there are many important academic , career , and social/emotional competencies that students develop through the implementation of effective school counseling curriculum interventions ( Campbell &; Dahir , 1997 ) . Early information about goal setting , test-taking strategies , study skills , decision-making , and other competencies that enhance student achievement can make a difference in student learning ( Brigman &; Campbell , 2003 ; Gerler &; Herndon , 1993 ; Webb , Brigman , &; Campbell , 2005 ) . For example , many students must make decisions about whether or not to attend vocational schools by the end of eighth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make these decisions more easily and effectively ( Jones , Sheffield , &; Joyner , 2000 ; Luzzo &; Pierce , 1996 ) . School counselors also can educate students about the social and emotional changes they will experience starting in middle school . Early information about these topics can prevent the need for more intensive interventions later in the students ' educational process . <p> School counselors also can assist middle school students by encouraging them to take more challenging math and science classes . The influence that school counselors have through academic advisement can have a tremendous impact on students ' academic success ( Trusty , Robinson , Plata , &; Kok-Mun , 2000 ) . Ensuring that all students have access to challenging and appropriate classes is a focus of the ASCA National Model , because this is one of the key ways to intervene in the achievement gap that currently exists in our country ( ASCA , 2005 ; House &; Martin , 1998 ) . School counselors can facilitate students ' academic achievement by working with teachers and administrators to ensure that the school provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management and accountability systems . Transition planning at any level can be supported by the use of data , as outlined in the management system of the ASCA National Model . Needs assessments of incoming students can help to determine program components . Achievement data ( grades , state test scores , etc. ) and achievement-related data ( discipline records , attendance , extracurricular involvement , etc. ) can give school counselors crucial information about the specific strengths and challenges of an incoming group . Competency-related data about what ASCA National Standards competencies a class has ( how many students have 4- or 6-year plans , the percentage who have participated in career education or job shadowing , etc. ) can aid in curriculum planning . The impact of the work that counselors are doing can be shown with the use of data presented to key constituencies . Demonstrating to parents , school board members , and administrators that school counselors influence academic achievement by providing effective transitioning services is a valuable way to illustrate the critical role of school counseling in student success . The ASCA National Model and Transitioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselors in high schools have the challenging job of helping students make effective choices about college , career , and work . Foundation components that emphasize academic , career , and social/emotional services for all students create an environment that supports student achievement and growth . When school counseling programs have an articulated focus on academic achievement , school counselors are less likely to need to defend the time taken away from academic courses for counseling activities . If teachers and administrators see counseling results that demonstrate a positive impact on grades , career knowledge , and social/emotional functioning among students , they are more likely to value the work that school counselors are doing . <p> Delivery system . Counselors in high schools provide a wide range of services for students transitioning into and out of their building . Many of the program components previously discussed are also present at the high school level ( e.g. , meetings with incoming students and their families , academic and college/career counseling , curriculum interventions , parents ' nights , information dissemination ) . In addition , school counselors can enhance delivery through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources available through the counseling program . Moreover , secondary counselors can evaluate gaps in students ' academic , career , and social competencies , and they can provide individual and group interventions to address these challenges as they prepare students for matriculation . <p> Management and accountability systems . At the high school level , calendars and other communication systems about program components are important ways that counselors can demonstrate that they are providing services for all students in the building . With these systems in place , students , parents , and teachers know when there will be classroom instruction about postsecondary choices and academic planning , and they can find out how to access financial aid and college application materials . Because high schools typically track greater amounts of data about academic outcomes such as grades , course-taking patterns , and postsecondary choices , school counselors have even more information about achievement-gap patterns and remediation and are better equipped to make data-based decisions about program components , interventions , and student needs and outcomes . An effective accountability system is essentially already in place if the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CONCLUSION <p> In summary , the ASCA National Model ( ASCA , 2005 ) contains many useful tools and ideas for successful transitioning . Its focus on classroom and systemic program components allows for implementation even in districts with large caseloads . The emphasis on using data to make decisions about interventions provides an evidence-based process that is more likely to positively influence student achievement . With a planned , comprehensive school counseling program in place that adheres to the standards set forth by the ASCA National Model , student transitions from grade to grade and from school into the world of college and work can be even more successful . <p>
