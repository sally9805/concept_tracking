" **43;15224;TOOLONG , " said the clam , more or less . <P> It is a well-established fact that one of the main reasons for writing children 's literature is that it offers so many chances for dialogue like that . ( Just try to work that sentence into a romance novel . ) Michael Chabon , who won the Pulitzer Prize last year for The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &; Clay , is a novelist who can fashion an elegant grownup story as if it were a piece of soft aluminum . But the opportunity to plunge into the burdleburple of sheer fantasy is one reason he wrote Summerland ( Hyperion/Miramax ; 500 pages ) , the kind of book that features a motherly Sasquatch , some intrepid kids , numerous giants and " werefoxes , " and several cliff-hanger baseball games on which the fate of the whole world just happens to hinge , plus a giant , prognosticating clam . <P> Another famous reason to write children 's literature is that it gets you back in touch with your inner child . For Chabon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since in person he comes across like a man who already exchanges regular e-mails with his inner child and plays paintball tag with him all the time . But lately there 's a big new reason for writing stories aimed at " young readers , " the publishing-industry term for kids who are done with picture books but not quite ready for Tolstoy and Candace Bushnell . It 's Harry Potter . Harry 's success with the reading world  --  more than 100 million copies sold around the globe  --  is something that the writing world could not ignore . <P> Chabon ( pronounced Shay-bon ) is the best known of a field of established authors who are all at once producing books for the Potterhead age group and up . This fall brings titles by the Chilean novelist Isabel Allende ; Carl Hiassen , the deadpan satirist of modern Florida ; and Clive Barker , the ghoul  --  or whatever you would call the man behind the Hellraiser films . There 's serious money here . Even before Barker 's book appears in stores , Disney has reportedly paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his characters . Theme-park rights ? This never happened to Faulkner . <P> Chabon runs his fingers through his unkempt hair and looks up at the ceiling . He 's one of those radiant-child adults , the kind you can imagine as the dreamy fourth-grader he must once have been . We 're in his big Arts and Crafts-style house in Berkeley , Calif. , with his wife Ayelet Waldman , a former public defender turned crime novelist , and their three children , Sophie , 7 ; Zeke , 5 ; and Ida-Rose , 16 months . Chabon and his wife live in a noisy , kid-centered world . Waldman 's books are about a former public defender turned stay-at-home mom who cracks cases while the baby naps . As Chabon answers questions , the dog barks . Waldman picks a piece of fluff off her husband 's face . Sophie 's school calls with the news that Sophie just threw up . This would help explain why , in order to write , Chabon stashes himself away every morning in a small cottage behind the house , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Roberto Clemente baseball card .
