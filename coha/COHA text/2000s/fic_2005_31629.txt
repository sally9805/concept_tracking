11:49 P.M. , EDT , TUESDAY , SEPTEMBER 20 WASHINGTON , DC . The ' 07 civic sun cruised slowly through the deserted parking deck , staying carefully within the chem-glow drive lines . Silently it rounded the corner and rolled down the ramp to the lowest level , then stopped in front of a new Corvette Electro-T , which was parked facing the wall . The Sun 's tinted windows concealed its occupants until the passenger side opened . A brief flash from the dome light revealed two figures , a man behind the wheel and a tall , slender woman , who slipped out and quickly closed the door . Without a word to her companion , she walked around the Corvette , checking the interior , then the license plates . Satisfied , she signaled him to drive on . Over the barely perceptible hum of the electric engine , her footsteps echoed on the concrete as the small rental car moved toward the opposite end of the deck and parked . In a brisk , athletic stride , she approached the elevator a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doors . She checked her watch and prepared to wait . Minutes passed . She did not move . Her vigil was rewarded by the low growl of elevator cables . She shifted position ever so slightly onto the balls of her feet . The doors whooshed open , revealing athickset man carrying an attache case . He glanced left and right , then stepped hurriedly from the elevator . She raised her weapon and took aim . He caught the motion from the corner of his eye and whirled , reaching inside his jacket . The only sound breaking the silence was a soft pop from her small automatic . A tiny hole no bigger than the tip of her little finger appeared in the middle of the man 's forehead . His temples and eyeballs bulged grotesquely . Then , every bone in his body seemed to dissolve as he crumpled . Glancing around the dimly lit deck , the woman walked over to her victim and knelt beside his body . When she rolled the corpse onto its back , a thin trickle of blood oozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared blankly into space . Ignoring the slack face of death , she pulled the attache case from beneath the body . The Sun approached noiselessly as she stood up . She tossed the case inside and slid into the passenger seat . " You moved too soon . He caught you in peripheral , " her companion said as he drove up the ramp . " I know , " she replied in a tight voice . Glancing at her profile he grunted . " You okay ? " She sucked in a deep breath . " No . " The car circled up the ramp three more levels . As he slowed to make the final turn , she swung her door open and was violently sick on the concrete floor . Raising her head immediately , she slammed the door and said , " Go ! " He anticipated the command , relieved to see a faint bit of color returning to her face . " The first one is always bad , " he said . Fishing a texture wipe from her pocket , she scrubbed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 'll get easier after a few more . " She forced aside the image of that perfectly centered red dot just above those dead eyes . " God , I hope not . " THREE YEARS LATER 2:12 A.M. , EDT , TUESDAY , JUNE 16 ALEXANDRIA , VA . He was running flat out , his chest on fire as if someone were tightening a piano wire around it . Sharp , stinging pain lanced through his lungs as he gulped enough air to yell , " Stop ! FBI ! " Without breaking stride , he closed the distance between himself and the two men he was chasing down the narrow street . In the darkness , patches of light flashed between the buildings , black-and-white distortions , like images from an old twentieth-century cinema reel . The suspects ' flight stopped abruptly when the car waiting for them at the curb peeled away before they reached it . As they turned , he tried to stop and level his weapon but was not quick enough . They caught him limned in a sliver of dirty yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shallow furrow across his ribs as it slammed him against a rough brick wall . He gritted his teeth and raised his SIG-Sauer , squeezing off a shot , but the report was drowned out by the thunder of the second man 's MAC-10 . He felt the solid thunk of metal ripping into his flesh . Chest . Thigh . Knee . The hits registered in his brain as he slid slowly down the wall . Someone screamed his name . Sirens wailed in the distance . Everything faded to black but his knee still hurt like a bitch . If only the damn sirens would stop ringing . Ringing . He bolted upright into a sitting position . Drenched in sweat , he frantically ran his hands over his chest , down his left leg to staunch the bleeding . But there was no blood , only hot , sweaty flesh and the knotted lumps of healed scar tissue . His knee still throbbed evilly as he swung his legs over the side of the bed and fumbled for the phone jangling on the nightstand . Running his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two twenty-seven a.m . Taking a deep breath , he growled into the receiver , " Delgado . This better be good . " Elliott Delgado exited the 495 Beltway and turned west onto Braddock , glancing into his rearview vid screen at the nearly deserted highway behind him . If I was still with the Bureau , I 'd have a tail scanner tracking any car making three successive turns with me . He consoled himself with the thought that he had been allowed to keep the Buick Electra-TE . The combination turbine-electrical engine had a specially designed third mode -- -a turboelectric flash drive allowing the Buick to go a 190 kilometers per hour , small enough compensation for the titanium pins in his knee . He rubbed the old injury as he pulled into the left-turn lane . Affluent suburban developments sprawled between dense stands of sugar pines . A few lights winked from distant windows , but at 3:15 a.m. the densely populated area adjacent to Accotink Park slumbered . The residents rested in the assurance that they were a safe thirty klics away from the urban war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the city . These El-Ops sold the street drug of choice , Elevator , a highly unstable combination of cocaine and the old nonspecific impotence drug sildenafil citraze , commonly known as Viagra , which sent the coke-laden blood surging up the carotid arteries to the brain with the speed of an elevator . Del turned onto Danbury Forest and followed the winding road . What would he learn at this bizarre rendezvous ? Cal Putnam had told him to take the back way into King 's Park . His ex-boss knew he and Diana had lived in this old northern-Virginia development before their divorce . Putnam had been the mentor who 'd trained him , handpicked him for the most challenging assignments , and gone to the wall for him every time he 'd been called on the carpet by punctilious politicians inside the Bureau . Diana had accused him of caring more for " that crotchety , foulmouthed old Okie " than he did for his own wife . She was probably right . God knew he 'd spent more time with Cal than with her . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been promoted to deputy director and Delgado had climbed into a bottle . Whiskey under the bridge as Cal would say , he thought with a laugh , recalling this stretch of road and the jogger 's path across the bridge to the marina . A good choice for cover . It would be nearly impossible for anyone to follow them here . A tail would stand out like a Vegas stripper in the National Cathedral . He pulled off the road and made a U-turn , then parked the Buick in the sheltering shadows of a big dogwood . After remaining in the car for several moments , watching for anyone who might follow him , he slipped out and climbed over the metal guardrail . The descent down the steep hillside was made more difficult by dense foliage and darkness , but he found the wide dirt pathway . Tidewater in July was hot and fecund , infested with insects . Cicadas sang and mosquitoes hummed counterpoint between bites on his neck and arms . He 'd remembered his .50-caliber Smith &; Wesson but forgot to take a Buggone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stopped to get his bearings . The gravel path was rutted , filled with joggers and cyclists during daylight hours , but now deserted . It twisted deep inside the park . Mentally he marked off the distance to the bridge . Too damn far . The slight limp grew more pronounced with every kilometer . He remembered when he had run this course with ease every morning . But that was over seven years ago . Getting out of shape , old man . The sound of bubbling water grew louder as he neared the bridge over Accotink Creek . Then he saw a figure materialize out of the darkness on the other side of the rusty iron structure . He paused warily in the darkness until a familiar voice spoke . " No need to play hide-'n ' - seek . I been here for over half an hour . If I was n't followed , you were n't . " Cal Putnam 's nasal Oklahoma twang was unmistakable . Thinning gray hair and the leathery seams in his round face betrayed every one of his sixty-three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed chin , and one hell of an attitude . Del had always liked working for a man who cut through the bureaucratic bullshit . Delgado stood half a head taller than Putnam , whose slouched shoulders and paunch were the badge of a Washington bureaucrat chained to a desk . The old man was career FBI , working his way up to SAC in Oklahoma City before his thirtieth birthday . Now he was their number two man in Washington , deputy director . " What the hell 's going on , Cal ? I do n't hear squat from you for five years , then this middle-of-the-night intrigue . " Putnam kicked a rock , then looked up at Delgado . " Do n't piss in my hip pocket , Del . I 'm not the only one up to my ass in alligators . You fly around more than Chuck Yeager ever did . But I hear you 're one bitchin ' reporter , ole son . Won a Pulitzer a couple of years back , did n't you ? " " You never ask a question you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you did n't call me out here in the middle of the night to discuss my journalistic triumphs . " Del leaned against the wooden rail of the bridge , taking the weight off his bum knee . Putnam shrugged . " Nope on both counts . Mind if I indulge ? " He pulled an antique meerschaum and a well-crumpled bag of tobacco from his jacket pocket . " Fine by me . The stink will keep the insects away . " Delgado knew the old man took his own sweet time getting to a point . Putnam methodically tamped the shredded brown leaves into the bowl and lit the pipe , then took several experimental draws before nodding with satisfaction . He eyed Delgado 's fingers massaging his bent knee and said , " Still dealin ' you fits after three surgeries . Doctors could fuck up a rainstorm . " " I can walk . My pelvis rotates and I can even throw a softball for my kid again . Considering I got a full disability retirement from the Bureau five years ago , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to do this to you . Maybe BISC has the right idea -- -no ' Stop , police , ' no reading them their rights . Just a quick clean bullet in the brain . " " Judge , jury , and executioner all rolled up in the Bureau of Illegal Substance Control . I never liked it , Cal . Still do n't . " " Hoped you 'd still feel that way . " Cal 's chuckle was low and raspy . " Does this have something to do with BISC -- -or the Bureau ? " " The Bureau , BISC , the Colombians , hell , ole son , the whole damn shootin ' match . I lost two men in the last twenty-four hours . One in San Diego , one here in D.C. Both hit quick and clean . Both shot in the back of the head with a needle gun ... " He puffed on his pipe , letting the words sink in . " BISC is n't in the habit of losing those guns . Any rumor on the street about the bad guys finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys already have a source -- -some top-secret defense contractor , whoever the fuck supplies them to BISC . " " You 're saying BISC terminated two FBI agents ? " Delgado was stunned . " Why ? " " We 've been hearing rumors on the street for months about BISC going after the boys from Bogot . And to sweeten the pot , the Pentagon may be working with BISC . " Del whistled low . " The Cartel owns South America and most of Mexico . Attacking them would make the Second Iraqi War look like a lovers ' spat . " " Yeah , if any of their nukes got through , California would really glow after dark , " Cal agreed grimly . " Those agents were both investigating the situation . Then ... " Phitt . The rasping scrape of his wooden match made the point as he relit his pipe . " They ended up dead . No one but the highest-ranking personnel in the Bureau knew what my men were doing . I assigned Nuez and Crosby because they were the best . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to kill . " You think there 's a leak in the Bureau ? " Cal nodded . " Both BISC and the brass asses have been nursing an itch to expand the war on drugs beyond our borders ever since the Slaughter . I think after years of BISC and the Bureau hating each other 's guts , somebody in my command has gotten in bed with their fucking Tribunal and the Pentagon . " " You ca n't use normal channels to investigate for fear of tipping off a mole . " " Shit , it might be Drescher himself . Slippery bastard could hold his own in a pond full of eels . " Cal hated the director , a political appointee with no experience in law enforcement . " What about going directly to the president ? " " Wade Samson 's a real hard-nosed son of a bitch . I have n't got the evidence to prove my suspicions -- -just a couple of dead agents killed by needle guns . I need more . Look , you won that Pulitzer for a story about an innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigative reporter . You have due bills out all over . " " Hell , so do you , Cal . " " Yup . And I 'm calling one in now , ole son . " On the drive back into Alexandria , Elliott Delgado thought about his conversation with Cal . Had he been crazy , agreeing to help ? Sure thing . Maybe he 'd never gotten over being an agent . He grinned as he turned into the underground parking facility of his Pitt Street condo . Maybe he just wanted another Pulitzer . Either way , the rush of adrenaline was an addiction . Who needed Elevator to get high ? He 'd always had his work . That was both blessing and curse . Work sustained him when he was alone . But the reason he was alone was work . For the first couple of years of their marriage , Diana had tried to understand . But he had never been around when she or Mike needed him . " It 's over and done , " he muttered to himself as he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the security system for the custom automobile . Del entered the elevator and fumbled for the coded ID card , which was the old building 's pass at security . His apartment security was not much better than the building 's , since he 'd never bothered to have the door locks keyed into his computer , a small detail he kept meaning to accomplish but never had . Preoccupied by the information Cal had given him , he ignored the clutter in the living room and headed straight to the computer in his office . He fed the half-dollar-sized disc Cal had given him into the drive and gave his voice command to activate . Data came up on the screen after a few twitches and a blip of protest . Another thing he kept intending to do was get a new machine . Pulling a cold Superior cervega from the wall fridge , he zipped the plasti-tab and took a long pull as his eyes narrowed on the material . The text began with crime-scene photos of both terminations . Poor devils never knew what hit them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barely visible point of entry was in the back of the head . The small , narrow missile from a needle gun penetrated only animal tissue , but once inside it vaporized , creating a wound the size of a golf ball , causing the eyeballs and even the skull to bulge out . Instantaneous destruction . Surgical precision . There were no ricochets , no pass-throughs , no way for an innocent bystander to be hit unless the BISC shooter was a lousy shot , which never happened , or if the agent chose an innocent victim . Alarmingly , that occurred more often than politicians inside the Beltway would admit . There was nothing more obscene than a body collapsed in death , boneless , vulnerable . Police photos revealed nothing of value to Del . Crosby was hit inside his own garage in a modest Maryland suburb . No one else was at home . Divorce . Delgado was certain it was an occupational hazard for Bureau members . Nuez had been taken out in a shopping mall parking lot . Del scrolled for the inventory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pig carcass in a piranha tank . Not so much as a texture wipe was left in either man 's clothing . If Crosby or Nuez had been carrying any useful evidence , the BISC agents had removed it . No witnesses to either termination . Sometimes there were . BISC agents liked anonymity but were occasionally forced to take out a drug dealer in front of bystanders . Since they were licensed to kill by act of Congress , the police had no jurisdiction . " But these shoots were n't righteous , " he muttered , taking another swallow of beer . Of course , he knew no rational being could finger a BISC agent even if one shot the pope . Hell , they had their fingerprints removed . They were shrouded in secrecy , feared . " What civilian would want to piss them off ? " Del scrolled through the day logs of the two men . Crosby had a scrawled " G. Goodacre , noon " under yesterday 's date . The name was probably a code of some sort . Slim pickings but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc . He instructed his computer program 's search engines to locate any G. Goodacres . Who the hell are you ? He pulled another beer from the fridge and opened it . Since his bout with the bottle , beer and wine with dinner were all he allowed himself to drink . Two was his limit . Shortly , the screen pinged , filled with a dozen entries . He scanned them . Mostly obscure , but then one caught his eye -- -Glenna Goodacre , an American sculptor , who 's most famous work was the Women 's Vietnam Memorial , completed in 1993 . As per Bureau procedure , he pulled the disc from the A drive and destroyed it . A rendezvous site ? Tomorrow he might find out . Continues ...
