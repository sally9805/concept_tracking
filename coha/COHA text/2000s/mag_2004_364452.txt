The latest version of Yahoo Messenger makes instant messaging more than just talk . For starters , the free program lets you customize your appearance online by designing your avatar : choose a hairstyle , a body type , even sunglasses to create a special look . When you launch your friends list , you can view news headlines , sports updates , stock prices or your calendar in the same window . You can also easily access games directly in Yahoo Messenger . And if you like to listen to music while you chat , just log on to Yahoo 's Launchcast online radio service . With a single click , you can broadcast the channel to your friends so they can tune in as well .  --  By Anita Hamilton
