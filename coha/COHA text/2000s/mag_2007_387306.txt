. It took becoming a mom to finally force one woman to face her alcoholism . Here , how she stopped drinking and repaired the damage done to her family . I brought a bottle of champagne with me to the hospital when I delivered my first child . I 'd been looking forward to a drink for the eight months or so I 'd known I was pregnant . Champagne was n't my drink of choice , but I figured the nurses might frown on finding a jug of vodka in the communal fridge . It took my husband , William , and me four years to conceive Polly , and during that time I had cut back on my drinking the second half of each month when I thought I could be pregnant . After three IVF attempts , though , my infertility doctor advised me to consider adoption . " I do n't want to waste any more of your time and money , " he said . " You 're not producing quality eggs . " The next month I was astonished  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't pick up another drink until the celebratory champagne . Having been dry for so long , those sips of bubbly gave me an instant buzz . I welcomed the familiar warmth of the alcohol as it dulled the edges of worry and regret  --  a particularly comforting sensation now that I was embarking on the stress-strewn path of motherhood . Since I planned to breastfeed , I resigned myself to another few months of sobriety . But things did n't go well from the beginning . Breastfeeding was painful , and Polly did n't seem to be latching on . When she went almost 12 hours without wetting a diaper , I went to see a lactation specialist . After three hours , three pairs of hands ( mine , my mother 's , a nurse 's ) , and a complicated contraption that involved taping a tube to my nipple , we got Polly to take in half an ounce . Needless to say , I could n't replicate the results at home . After a weekend of guilt that was fueled by well-meant but anxiety-inducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least now , I thought to myself , I can drink . Almost immediately , I was back to my prepregnancy drinking levels . Every night I downed a couple of supersized cocktails , each containing two one-ounce shots of vodka , topped with a splash of tonic . Before bed I 'd take a swig out of a shot glass  --  for medicinal purposes , I told myself , so I could fall asleep . William saw me drink , but he was in the dark about my alcoholism . Denial and complicity probably played a part . While he 's not an alcoholic , he enjoys a beer or two each night , so my drinking seemed less egregious . But also , I was pretty good at holding my liquor . I took care of things at home without any obvious blunders . While I could be distracted and distant , I was never sloppy or maudlin . Less than a year later I found out I was pregnant again , with our second daughter , Louise , and stopped drinking . Once more , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uterine infection required in-patient treatment at the hospital , and Louise was n't allowed to stay with me . I remember William saying , kiddingly , " The things you 'll do to avoid breastfeeding . " Little did he know how relieved I was to be able to drink again . From my skewed perspective , it seemed that for a long time , my children 's lives were unaffected by my drinking . After all , they went to bed by 7:30 P.M. , and I did n't pour my first cocktail until 7 P.M. I knew I drank too much , but I figured , hey , I 'm not hurting anyone . But by the time the girls started school , and were going to bed later , I could no longer deny that my drinking was making me a rotten parent . I rarely remembered what page we were on when we read bedtime stories , and I hiccuped through readings on more occasions than I care to admit . I remember trying to help Louise with her kindergarten homework one night  --  something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too drunk to figure it out . I could n't make phone calls after 8 P.M. ( when most moms arrange playdates ) because I might slur my words . And while I rarely had hangovers  --  I drank just enough that I 'd feel decent the next day  --  there were many times when I was overly tired and cranky . The most appalling part is that I was n't there emotionally for my children . Kids tend to share what 's going on in their lives at the dinner table and when you 're tucking them into bed at night . I did n't want to eat with my girls because I got a bigger buzz when I drank on an empty stomach . At bedtime I was always in a hurry to get to that second cocktail . They 'd tell me about a new friend or a favorite book and I 'd be thinking , Yeah , yeah , yeah , get to the point . If one of the girls wanted me to snuggle in bed with her , I 'd decline , even if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't that I did n't want to , I 'd lie to myself , it 's just that I needed to enforce a strict bedtime ritual . No doubt William saw some of this , but because he usually got home from work after the kids were already in bed , my behavior went largely unnoticed by him . Still , it was becoming increasingly difficult to convince myself that I could be a good mother and wife and continue to drink . So slowly , ever so slowly , I allowed the fact that I had a drinking problem to sink in . Every Sunday when I took Polly and Louise to church , I would check the program schedule for the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings that took place there . I was n't ready to join , but it was comforting to know that help was available . Often during services , I 'd weep silently . Sometimes I 'd be thinking about what a worthless lush I was ; other times I was n't sure why I was crying . The defining moment , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 and Louise , 5 . I had a stomach flu , which I hid from my husband because I did n't want him telling me not to drink . When he saw me draped over the toilet , he asked me , " How much did you have to drink ? " I looked up at him and , without thinking , said , " I 'm an alcoholic . " For years I 'd been silently berating myself for being a drunk , but it was n't until I spoke those three words out loud that I felt compelled to take action . At first I tried to quit drinking on my own . I made it only two weeks . I 'll never forget the look in Polly 's eyes when I started up again . She heard the tinkling of the ice in my glass and looked from me , to the glass , and back to me . She may have been too young to understand what was in the glass , but she knew she did n't like what it did to her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AA meeting . I was shamelessly haughty about the ragtag mix of people there , including a schizophrenic and an octogenarian with a speech impediment . Surely I was n't as bad off as these losers . Still , I did as the group suggested  --  I kept going back . Over the next few weeks I found that I did , in fact , belong . I even became proud to belong . I learned that whether you are a suburban mom , a factory worker , or a soap opera star , when you 're an alcoholic you 're powerless against alcohol , and you have an insular and joyless life . Alcoholism is an equal opportunity destroyer . It is also a disease . And my medicine was to attend meetings , much the same way a diabetic takes insulin . I was also reminded of a crucial fact : Alcoholism runs in families . Both my mother 's and father 's sides , I realized , are blessed in spades , including , I suspect , my parents , aunts , uncles , and a sibling or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to stop the chain . If I could n't help passing along my faulty genes , at least I could set a sober  --  and sane  --  example for my kids . I could prevent them from seeing the devastating effect alcohol has on a family . I grew up watching the adults in my life drink . I thought it was normal to live your life around cocktail hour , to rage when you did n't get your way , to retreat into a bottle . Even when my father was on his deathbed suffering from prostate cancer , he and my mother had cocktails every night . I remember thinking , I do n't want to die like that . I do n't want to die a drunk . And I do n't want my girls growing up doing imitations of me clink-clinking through the house clutching a cocktail like my siblings and I do when we mimic my mother . Being sober was a daily struggle in the beginning . It was n't so much that I wanted a drink , although I did want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to step out of my life , to stop being me , at least for an hour . I felt raw and vulnerable , as if I did n't have any skin . I 'd wake up in the morning and think , What 's there to look forward to if I ca n't drink ? Before parties , I 'd get panicky . How could I socialize without being at least a little tipsy ? I worried whether I would ever laugh or have fun again . I managed to make it through the first few months with support from William and close friends whom I 'd told about my addiction , and from my burgeoning faith in God . But things were rocky on the home front . William seemed threatened by my not drinking , or , at least , he missed having someone to party with . And it did n't help that I was unfailingly selfish about getting sober  --  I thought my spiritual growth was the most exciting news on the planet , and I expected William to cater to my rigorous AA schedule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment from years of my taking out my unhappiness on William . It was a rough few months , but we slowly let go of the past and learned to trust each other . Today he 's every bit as committed to  --  and grateful for  --  my sobriety as I am . He 's not crazy about having to drink his beers where I ca n't see him , but we both feel blessed that my abstinence has restored our exuberant marriage to its original luster . As for Louise and Polly , I now take them to swim meets without cutting the evening short to rush home and drink . I make postdinner library runs if they need a book for school . I remember what bedtime story we 're reading and soothe away their nightmares . And I am a decent role model . I used to feel disingenuous discussing the perils of underage drinking and drugs . But recently we drove by a smashed-up car that was parked in front of the local high school , and when Polly and Louise asked why it was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving drunk . It was a relief not to feel like a hypocrite . Because I do n't want my kids to think that recovering from alcoholism is shameful , I 've always been open with them about it . But although Polly and Louise are growing up surrounded by AA , I still worry that one or both of them will become an alcoholic . If you have the genetic predisposition , it does n't take much to tip the balance in favor of substance abuse . I know I ca n't control my daughters ' futures , though . All I can do is explain that their family is riddled with alcoholism , and that the earlier they take a drink the more likely they are to wind up addicted . And I can continue to be a good example by staying sober . The other day I took my kids with me to an AA meeting ( something I 've done over the years when they 've been on school break ) . Afterward , my littlest one said , " Those meetings look like fun . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If my girls ever need Alcoholics Anonymous , I pray that they 'll remember the strength , love , and hope they 've seen there . * 1ll names have been changed . PULLQUOTE " It was becoming increasingly difficult to convince myself that I could be a good mother and wife and continue to drink . BOX WOMEN WHO DRINK : THE SOBERING FACTS More than for men , alcoholism in women is a silent struggle . While it 's the number one addiction among women  --  outranking all other forms of drug abuse combined  --  fewer than 1 percent of the 2.7 million women who are alcoholics received treatment last year , according to the Substance Abuse &; Mental Health Services Administration at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . That 's less than half the number of male alcoholics who got treatment . A main reason for the low rate : Women feel a greater stigma than men  --  and often are too ashamed or embarrassed to seek help . But early treatment is especially critical : * One drink for a woman equals two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less water ( so alcohol is more concentrated ) and less of an enzyme that metabolizes alcohol . * Women develop alcohol-related diseases , such as cirrhosis and high blood pressure , more rapidly and with lower levels of use than men . * Women are more likely to suffer from depression , anxiety , and eating disorders linked to drinking . Any woman who has three or more drinks a day or seven drinks a week could be at risk for alcohol-related problems .
