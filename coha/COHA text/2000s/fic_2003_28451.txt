Chapter One Gwendolen Murphy , known to friends and foes alike as Gwen , grimaced distastefully as she turned onto Logan property . It had taken her nearly an hour to get here from Lubbock and the ranch house was another half a mile from the main road . The Texas heat was oppressive and halfway there her air-conditioning had decided not to work . Her short chestnut hair was damp with perspiration and beginning to curl into little ringlets , the back of her shirt where it rested against the seat was wet and her jeans were clinging with an uncomfortable heaviness . But the physical discomfort was n't what was gnawing at her . Coming back to this small bit of Texas brought too many unhappy memories . The tiny frame house she and her mother had lived in was on property that abutted the Logan ranch . Just driving past the place where she 'd spent her childhood had sent a cold chill down Gwen 's spine . Memories of her two stepfathers interspersed between her mother 's boyfriends , the smell of liquor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the couch , had assailed her . Her mother had n't been a bad woman , just a weak one . Something Gwen had vowed never to be . And then there was Jess Logan . Since grade school , she and Jess had harbored a mutual dislike . It was , she knew , more her doing than his . Even at that young age , her reaction to him had been defensive . He 'd stirred emotions within her that made her uneasy , and the distrust of men she 'd learned from watching her mother had fed that uneasiness . As a result , she 'd rejected his initial offer of friendship and from then on both had avoided each other whenever possible . Still , the uneasy effect he had on her had been constantly there , deep inside , a nagging something she 'd worked hard to kill . When she 'd moved to Lubbock following her mother 's death , she 'd figured he was one thorn that was out of her life for good . " I do n't know why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't true . She 'd come because Morning Hawk , Jess 's great-grandmother , had summoned her . There were those who thought the old woman was a few bales short of a full load . Others were intimidated by her . And they all had good reason . Morning Hawk could be enigmatic and cantankerous , but Gwen owed her . It was a debt that dated back to Gwen 's early teens ... and was the only time , until today , that Gwen had ever had any contact with Morning Hawk . Parking in front of the ranch house , she saw the elderly , pure-blooded Apache , small , bent and looking withered with age , sitting in a rocking chair on the porch . As Gwen left the car and mounted the short flight of steps , Morning Hawk rose to greet her . " I have a quest for you , " the woman said without any preamble . Gwen felt as if she 'd stepped back in time about a hundred years . " A quest ? " Morning Hawk motioned for Gwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , well-maintained home , furnished comfortably . More upscale than most ranch houses , but then the Logans could afford it . Oil had been struck on their land several years earlier . But in spite of the enormous added income the find had produced , it was still a working ranch . Jess 's father had died years earlier . His two brothers had followed in their father 's footsteps and become Texas Rangers . Jess had been the one who had stayed home to run the ranch for his mother . Gwen hoped he was out on the range and would stay there until she was gone . " Come along . " Morning Hawk took her by the arm and guided her down a hallway . Stopping in front of a closed door , Morning Hawk knocked sharply , then opened the door and , with Gwen still in tow , entered . Seated at the desk in the study punching buttons on a computer keyboard was Jess Logan . Half-Apache , his Native American heritage was strong in his rugged features . His muscular build and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was spent in manual labor . Gwen had to fight down the urge to turn and run . Silently she cursed herself . In spite of all the effort she 'd put into trying to rid herself of this effect he had on her , it was as strong as ever . Jess frowned at his great-grandmother . " You said you had someone coming this morning it was important I meet with . " His tone told Gwen she did n't fall into that category . Well , he was n't on her list of people she wanted to see either . " Remember your manners , " Morning Hawk admonished . She motioned for the two of them to be seated as she seated herself . Neither obeyed . " I do n't believe there is anything Miss Murphy and I have to discuss . " Jess headed to the door , adding over his shoulder , " I 've got work to do . " " Jess Logan , you will sit down , " Morning Hawk commanded . " And listen to what I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inwardly , she could n't help but smile at the way this order from such a tiny old shriveled woman stopped the mountain of a cowboy in his tracks . " All right , I 'll give you five minutes , " he grumbled , taking his seat behind the desk . Her curiosity overcoming her discomfort in Jess 's presence , Gwen seated herself without protest . Morning Hawk knew of the animosity between Gwen and her grandson . Everyone did . They just did n't know why it existed . Even Jess , Gwen knew , had been stunned by the intensity with which she 'd rejected his offer of friendship . But Gwen was n't willing to reveal to anyone how much she feared the very womanly sensations his presence evoked . She did n't even like admitting them to herself . In the end , people , Jess included , had decided that it was one of those chemistry things - like oil and water or opposite poles of a magnet that repelled each other . So why would the elderly Apache insist on having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawk turned her full attention to Gwen . " I understand you run a very personalized investigative service . You are hired by people who are n't certain they can trust the man or woman they are dating and want to know the whole truth about them ? " Her intonation made her words a question and Gwen elaborated on the service she provided . " In today 's world , people move around a great deal . That makes it easy for a person to change their past to suit their present needs . And then there 's the Internet . Someone from New York might meet a person from Alaska online and begin a long-distance romance , but how does either one know the other is telling the truth ? They do n't . So one or the other hires me to find out . " Morning Hawk nodded approvingly as if to say what she had just been told was what she had wanted to hear . " So in a way you are a matchmaker . " " More of a match breaker , usually , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies people will tell to deceive others . " " No . No , I would not . And that brings me to the reason I arranged this meeting . " Morning Hawk turned her attention to Jess . " It is time you took a wife . " Jess shook his head . " I knew you were up to something when you started humming as soon as Mom and Grandma left for California to visit Uncle Crow . I 'll get married when I 'm good and ready . And right now , I 'm just not ready to take that step . " " You 're twenty-nine , that 's old enough to be good and ready , " Morning Hawk returned . Jess frowned . " Why this sudden interest in my marital status ? Both of my brothers were older than I am now when they got married . " ( Continues ... )
