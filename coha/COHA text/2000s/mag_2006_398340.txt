The teenage queen , now the subject of a new movie , was embraced by France in 1770 . Twenty-three years later , she lost her head to the guillotine . ( But she never said , " Let them eat cake " ) <p> LATE SEPTEMBER sunlight filters onto the blue velvet furnishings of the jewel-box theater built for Marie Antoinette at Versailles . The painted , original backdrop depicts a rustic farmhouse hearth , and I can just imagine the young queen reveling in her role as a shepherdess while her witty friends and dull husband , French king Louis XVI , applaud politely . <p> At the time I was there , the theater was closed to most visitors ( it is now open to the public from April 1 through October 31 ) , and I wanted to take full advantage of my access .

" From time to time , you have to visit a spot like the theater when there 's no one else around to give the place a chance to trigger an emotional reaction , " he said . " You 're thinking about other things , then all of a sudden , you 're totally surprised . It 's a state of grace , an aura you sense  --  even after 40 years here . " <p> I did not commune with Marie Antoinette 's ghost , as some claim to have done . But I had to admit that there is a poignancy about the playhouse and its fantasy world . Less than a decade after the theater 's inauguration in 1780 , the curtain would come crashing down on the French monarchy and its Austrian-born queen , who seemed to grow in moral stature as she approached the guillotine . <p> With the possible exception of the Corsican-born Napoleon , another outsider who overstayed his welcome , no one haunts French history like the Hapsburg princess .

" Ultimately , even Marie Antoinette herself grasped how suffering gave her fortitude . " Tribulation first makes one realize what one is , " the queen wrote in August 1791 , soon after the royal family 's failed escape attempt from their detention in Paris . <p> MARIE ANTOINETTE 'S fairy tale turned tragedy has spawned biographies , fictionalizations , operas , plays , ballets and memoirs . Even her hairdresser and her executioner published ghostwritten recollections . And , like the 300 gowns the queen ordered each year , the story is a perfect fit for Hollywood . The 1938 film Marie Antoinette , starring Norma Shearer and Robert Morley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sofia Coppola has directed a new interpretation , with Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman in the lead roles . Based largely on British biographer Antonia Fraser 's 2001 biography , Marie Antoinette : The Journey , the new film , also called Marie Antoinette , was released in the United States last month . " I was struck by the fact that Louis and Marie were teenagers  --  he was 19 when he was crowned , she was 18  --  in charge of France at the most vulnerable time in its history , " says Coppola . " I did n't set out on a campaign to correct the misperceptions about her ; I just wanted to tell the story from her point of view . " <p> Each year millions of visitors flock to Versailles and Fontainebleau , where the queen maintained a second palace , to admire her exuberant tastes in furniture and dcor . But it is her furtive love life that arouses the deepest interest  --  and sympathy Tarred by pamphleteers for sexual wantonness , she was actually rather prudish , at least according to her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent flirtations , she deeply loved  --  probably with Louis ' tacit approval , according to a confidante- only one man : Swedish military attach Count Axel Fersen . <p> - Although Marie Antoinette initially condescended to her husband , she eventually developed a genuine fondness for him . For his part , Louis was completely devoted to her and never took a mistress , exhibiting a restraint virtually unheard of in an 18th-century French king . <p> Whatever Marie Antoinette 's faults  --  in addition to her renowned extravagance , she was unable to comprehend the French people 's thirst for democracy  --  she did not respond to news that starving Parisians had no bread by saying : " Let them eat cake . " According to Fraser , this monumental indifference was first ascribed , probably also apocryphally , to Maria Theresa , the Spanish princess who married Louis XIV more than a century before Marie Antoinette set foot in France . Still , for more than two centuries , historians have debated whether Marie Antoinette bore the blame for her fate or was a victim of circumstance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unrepentant enemy of democratic ideals , her many acts of compassion included tending to a peasant gored by a stag and taking in a poor orphan boy and overseeing his education . " She was so happy at doing good and hated to miss any opportunity of doing so , " wrote Madame Campan , the First Lady of the Bedchamber . The softhearted queen , it seems , hungered more for tenderness than power . <p> The opposite might be said of her mother , Austrian em- press Maria Theresa , who regarded her eight daughters as pawns on the European chessboard , to be married off to seal alliances . She barely paused in her paperwork to give birth on November 2 , 1755 , to her 15th child , Maria Antonia Josepha Joanna , or Antoine ( as Marie Antoinette was called in her homeland ) . In France , Louis Auguste , the 11-year-old grandson of French monarch Louis XV , became a prime matrimonial candidate when , in 1765 , his father , Louis Ferdinand , died , making the grandson heir to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Louis to cement the union of the Hapsburgs and Bourbons  --  bitter rivals since the 16th century <p> Dispatched to Vienna in 1768 by Louis XV to tutor his grandson 's future wife , the Abb de Vermond encountered an easily distracted 13-year-old who could barely read or write her native German , much less French . But " her character , her heart , are excellent , " he reported . He found her " more intelligent than has been generally supposed , " but since " she is rather lazy and extremely frivolous , she is hard to teach . " Blessed with thick , ash-blond hair , large , grayish blue eyes and a radiant complexion , Marie Antoinette possessed a delicate beauty marred only slightly by a pouty Hapsburg lower lip . <p> For her May 1770 wedding , she was escorted to France amid an entourage that included 57 carriages , 117 footmen and 376 horses . Arriving in the forest of the royal chateau of Compigne , some 50 miles northeast of Paris , the 14-year-old Antoine , now called by the more formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aprs moi , le dluge " ) , waiting with his grandson outside their carriage , and curtsied , instantly winning over the king , who kissed her . Perhaps intimidated by her forwardness , the 15-year-old bridegroom gave her a perfunctory kiss , then hardly glanced at her as she chatted away with the king on the ride to the chateau . The awkward , myopic heir apparent suffered from feelings of unworthiness , despite a facility for languages and a passion for history geography and science . <p> Louis Auguste de Bourbon and Marie Antoinette were married on May 16 , 1770 , in the royal chapel at the palace of Versailles . The next day ; news that the union had not been consummated spread through the court . It was only the beginning ; by all accounts , the marriage went unconsummated for seven years . By this time , Louis XV had died ( of smallpox , in 1774 ) and his teenage grandson had acceded to the most powerful throne in Europe . <p> After encouraging her daughter to " lavish more caresses " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , as she put it , to " stir up this indolent spouse . " Whatever he said apparently did the trick ; in any case , the couple wrote to thank him . Many historians conclude that Louis suffered from phimosis , a physiological handicap that makes sex painful , and that he eventually had surgery to correct the problem . Biographer Fraser , however , contends that the pair were simply ; as Joseph reported to his brother Leopold , " two complete blunderers . " <p> Added to any sexual frustration Marie Antoinette may have felt was her homesickness ( " Madame , My very dear mother , " she wrote , " I have not received one of your dear letters without having the tears come to my eyes . " ) and her rebellion against court etiquette ( " I put on my rouge and wash my hands in front of the whole world , " she complained in 1770 of a daily ritual at which dozens of courtiers hovered ) . She sought escape in masked balls , opera , theater and gambling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21-year-old queen confessed in October 1777 to her trusted adviser , Austrian ambassador Comte Florimond Mercy d'Argenteau . <p> Where Louis was indecisive , thrifty and over-serious , Marie Antoinette was quick to make up her mind , extravagant and lighthearted . He loved being alone , tinkering with locks ; she craved the social whirl . When Louis went to bed , around 11 p.m. , Marie Antoinette was just revving up for a night of festivities . By the time she awoke , around 11 a.m. , Louis had been up for hours . " My tastes are not the same as the King 's , who is only interested in hunting and his metal-working , " the queen wrote to a friend in April 1775 . And what exorbitant tastes she had ! She bought a pair of diamond bracelets that cost as much as a Paris mansion . She sported towering bouffant hairdos , including the " inoculation pouf , " a forbidding confection that featured a club striking a snake in an olive tree ( representing the triumph of science over evil ) to celebrate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Informed of her daughter 's behavior by Mercy ; Maria Theresa fired off letter after letter warning Marie Antoinette to mend her ways . " You lead a dissipated life , " the mother railed in 1775 . " I hope I shall not live to see the disaster that is likely to ensue . " <p> Cloistered in the luxury of Versailles , the royal couple was oblivious to their subjects ' plight . A failed harvest had made the price of grain skyrocket , and mobs were rioting in the streets of Paris , demanding cheap bread . Crushing taxes were also taking their toll on the populace . Meanwhile , the queen gambled recklessly ; ordered expensive jewelry and clothes and spent a fortune on creating her own private domain at Versailles  --  the Petit Trianon . The three-story neo-Classical chateau was originally built on the grounds of Versailles in 1762-68 by Louis X-V for his mistress Madame de Pompadour . Louis XVI had given it to Marie Antoinette in June 1774 , a few days after he became king , when she asked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her . ) " She wanted a domain reserved for her intimate circle of friends , " says Baulez , as we tour the Trianon . " But unfortunately ; this exclusion made everyone else at court jealous . " Palace gossip spun outrageous tales about " scandalous " and " perverse " goings-on at the Trianon , giving anti-monarchist pamphleteers material for salacious underground cartoons . How could the queen spend the nation 's money , at a time of financial crisis , on her private hideaway , critics asked . <p> But Marie Antoinette seemed blind to the criticism . She directed architect Richard Mique and artist Hubert Robert to conjure up a sylvan fantasy of artificial streams , grottoes and winding paths . ( During nighttime galas , a Temple of Love rotunda and a glass music salon were illuminated by wood fires hidden in trenches in the ground . ) In 1784 , the two designers created what , from the outside , appeared to be a hamlet ( the Hameau ) of cracked and tumbledown cottages , which , in fact , were appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working farm completed what Zweig satirized as " this expensive pastoral comedy , " though tales of the queen herself herding sheep are false , Baulez insists . The overall effect of the Petit Trianon was  --  and remains  --  quaintly charming , but the total bill , including the Hameau , came to more than two million francs ( the equivalent of more than $6 million today ) . To this day ; the Petit Trianon  --  Silk hangings , wall coverings , porcelain dinner services , furniture  --  bears Marie Antoinette 's stamp , with flower-mad motifs in cornflower blue , lilac and green . " She loved ornamentation , " says Baulez . " She was n't interested in dignity , but the picturesque . She had the tastes of an actress , not an austerely regal queen . " <p> In one salon is the exquisite harp Marie Antoinette played well enough to accompany Antonio Salieri , the Hapsburg court composer and Mozart rival she invited to visit . In an adjoining room , Baulez shows me the infamous pale blue boudoir with mirrored interior shutters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People imagined mirrors surrounding a bed for secret trysts , " he says , " but she was just trying to keep curious passersby from peering inside . " ' Whatever trysts there were did not include Louis , who spent not a single night at the Petit Trianon , although he did occasionally pop by to read to himself in a little rowboat . <p> Fersen was the more frequent guest . The queen went so far as to furnish an apartment above hers for him . By October 1787 , they were exchanging clandestine letters about such prosaic domestic details as where to put a stove . Unraveling the details of their relationship has kept biographers guessing for more than zoo years , largely because Fersen destroyed substantial portions of his journal and a great-nephew to whom his letters were entrusted censored some and suppressed others . " I can tell you that I love you , " Marie Antoinette declared in one letter back to him . <p> They had met at a Paris opera ball in January 1774 , when Fersen , the 18-year-old son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young queen invited him to several balls at Versailles , but not long after , he left for England . Four years later he returned to the French court as a young military officer and , according to Comte Francois Emmanuel de Saint- Priest  --  Louis ' future minister of the interior  --  " captured the queen 's heart . " In early 1779 , Fersen signed on to fight on behalf of France in the American Revolution , in part perhaps to escape the queen 's growing infatuation . When he returned to Versailles four years later , in June 1783 , he wrote to his sister , swearing off marriage because : " I can not belong to the only person to whom I want to belong , the one who really loves me , and so I do not want to belong to anyone . " That summer , he visited Marie Antoinette nearly every day <p> By now the 27-year-old queen mother of a 4 1/2-year-old daughter , Marie Thrse Charlotte , and a son , the Dauphin Louis Joseph Xavier , nearly 2  --  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demeanor some saw as dignified , others as haughty . As a young princess , she had burst into tears when Mercy had pressured her to get involved in politics ; now she scolded the French foreign minister for excluding Joseph II from the peace process with England , though to little effect . <p> Some two years later , around the time her second son , Louis Charles , was born , Marie Antoinette became the victim of one of the most byzantine swindles in history . A fortune hunter named Jeanne de Lamotte Valois persuaded the gullible Cardinal de Rohan that she was a close friend of the queen 's  --  though Marie Antoinette had never heard of her . Lamotte 's lover , Rtaux de Villette , forged letters purportedly from the queen imploring the cardinal to buy a necklace of 647 diamonds costing 1.5 million francs ( $4.7 million today ) . Writing as the queen , de Villette said " she " was too embarrassed to ask Louis for so expensive a present and was relying on the gallant cardinal to obtain it for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After a clandestine meeting in the palace gardens with a woman hired by Lamotte to impersonate the queen , Rohan was hooked . When jewelers delivered the necklace to the cardinal , he gave it to Rtaux , disguised as the queen 's footman . Lamotte 's husband then smuggled it to London to be sold off in pieces . When the jewelers demanded payment in August 1785 , Marie Antoinette was livid with rage and Louis ordered Rohan arrested . <p> The subsequent trial caused a sensation . The Paris Parliament defied the king 's command to convict the duped cardinal and acquitted him . Lamotte was flogged , branded on her breast with a V for voleuse ( thief ) and tossed into prison . <p> And though Marie Antoinette was not on trial , she might as well have been . " The queen was innocent , " Napoleon observed years later , " and , to make sure that her innocence should be publicly recognized , she chose the Parliament of Paris for her judge . The upshot was that she was universally regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further fodder for scandal-mongering pamphleteers and journalists already intent on portraying the queen as greedy and corrupt . From then on , she could do no right . Her embarrassment made Louis more vulnerable than ever . Beset by severe food shortages , weighed down by taxes , resentful of royal absolutism and inspired by the egalitarian example of an independent United States , French citizens were growing increasingly vocal in their demands for self-government . In May 1789 , to avert the nation 's impending bankruptcy ( a series of wars , years of corruption and Louis ' support of the American Revolution as a means of weakening England had depleted the French treasury ) , the king convened the Estates-General , an assembly of representatives of the clergy , nobility and commoners that had not met since 1614 . As Marie Antoinette 's carriage wound from the palace through the streets of Versailles to welcome the gathering , crowds along the way stood in sullen silence . In a sermon at the town 's Church of Saint Louis , the Bishop of Nancy railed against the queen 's profligate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly blamed for the country 's desperate financial situation , although she had in fact already cut back on personal expenses . ) At the time of the Bishop 's sermon , however , the 33-year-old mother was consumed with anxiety over her older son , the gravely ill Dauphin . Within a month , the 7-year-old prince would be dead of tuberculosis of the spine . <p> Historians trace the French Revolution to that summer of 1789 . On July 14 , some 900 Parisian workers , shopkeepers and peasants  --  fearing that the king , who at the queen 's urging had moved a large number of troops to Versailles and Paris , would dissolve the representative National Assembly  --  stormed the Bastille prison to seize arms and ammunition . Marie Antoinette tried to convince her husband to put down the insurrection , but not wanting to provoke an all-out conflict , he refused , effectively ceding Paris to the revolutionaries . Comte Honor de Mirabeau , leader of the increasingly anti-monarchist National Assembly , observed that the queen had become " the only man at court . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age-old privileges for the aristocracy and clergy , declared a free press , got rid of serfdom and proclaimed the Rights of Man . <p> A little before noon on October 5 , a mob of several thousand market women , armed with pikes and sickles , set out from Paris ' Hotel de Ville ( City Hall ) on a 12-mile trek to Versailles to protest a lack of jobs and the high cost of bread . By evening , thousands more , some carrying guns , had joined them in front of the palace . After dithering over what to do , Louis finally decided to seek refuge in the distant Rambouillet chateau . But when his coachmen rolled out the royal carriages , the crowd cut the horses ' harnesses , stranding him and his family . <p> Around five o'clock on the morning of the sixth , rebels surged toward the queen 's bedroom , killing two guards . A terrified Marie Antoinette leapt out of bed and raced to the king 's apartments . Louis , meanwhile , had dashed to her bedroom to rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their son to join her and their daughter in the dining hall of his quarters . By this time , the Marquis de Lafayette , commander of the National Guard , had arrived with Guard troops and temporarily restored order . <p> But the throng , swollen to some 10,000 people , began clamoring to take Louis to Paris . When someone cried out for the queen to show herself on the balcony , she stepped forward , curtsying with such aplomb that the mob grew silent , then burst into cries of " Long live the queen ! " But Marie Antoinette sensed that the reprieve would be short-lived . Retreating inside , she broke down . " They are going to force us to go to Paris , the King and me , preceded by the heads of our bodyguards on pikes , " she said . Her words proved prophetic . Within hours , the triumphant procession  --  indeed with the guards ' heads on pikes  --  was escorting the captive royal family to the old Tuileries palace in the capital . <p> Although the king and queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the palace had they chosen to do so , they withdrew into self-imposed seclusion . The king seemed unable to act . " Taking the place of her husband ( whom everyone thrust contemptuously aside as an incurable weakling ) , " writes Zweig , Marie Antoinette " held council with the ministers and ambassadors , watching over their undertakings and revising their dispatches . " <p> " She was decisive where he was indecisive , " biographer Antonia Fraser says in a new PBS documentary Marie Antoinette . " She was courageous when he was vacillating . " She dashed off letters in cipher and invisible ink to other European sovereigns , pleading with them to invade France and shore up the king 's crumbling authority , but to no avail . Meeting secretly with Mirabeau in July 1790 , she won the influential legislator over to the cause of preserving the monarchy By December , however , she was devising a contingency plan to flee Paris for Montmd ) ; near the Austrian-controlled Netherlands .

But instead of following Bouill 's advice to make the trip in two light carriages , the queen insisted on keeping the family together in a lumbering coach called a berlin , encumbered with a silver dinner service , a clothes-press , and a small wine chest . ( Fersen had made the arrangements , even mortgaging his estate to pay for the carriage . ) Late in the evening of June 20 , 1791 , the royal family ; disguised as servants , slipped out of the capital . Fersen accompanied them as far as Bond ) ; 16 miles east of the Tuileries . While the horses were being changed , he pleaded with Louis to let him continue with the family rather than reuniting at Montmdy two days later as planned . Louis refused , perhaps , suggests biographer Evelyne Lever , because he thought it humiliating to be under the protection of his wife 's lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want people to think a foreigner had helped them get away <p> In Varennes , 130 miles east of Paris , a band of armed villagers accosted the king , who had been recognized inside the conspicuous berlin , and forced the royal entourage into a municipal official 's house . When a small contingent of Royalist troops arrived to free them , Louis vacillated , then , fearing a confrontation with the steadily growing mob brandishing arms outside the house , declined the troops ' help , choosing instead to wait for Bouill . Had Fersen , a trained officer , been allowed to stay with the group , he might well have taken more decisive action and helped lead the family to safety . Instead , emissaries dispatched by the Assembly arrived with orders to return the family to Paris . Crowds of angry Parisians lined the streets as the king and queen were taken back to the Tuileries palace , where they were held captive by National Guardsmen .

Meanwhile , at the same time Marie Antoinette was secretly lobbying moderate republicans in the Assembly for a constitutional monarchy she was also writing to European rulers that the " monstreuse " constitution was " a tissue of unworkable absurdities " and the Assembly " a heap of blackguards , madmen and beasts . " Although Louis privately detested the constitution , on September 14 , 1791 , he took an oath to uphold it , agreeing to share power with the elected Legislative Assembly . <p> In Stockholm , Fersen had persuaded the Swedish king to back a new escape attempt . In February 1792 , the daring count  --  by now branded an outlaw for his role in the flight to Varennes  --  snuck into the heavily guarded palace and spent some 30 hours with the queen . Toward the end of his visit , Louis showed up and rejected Fersen 's scheme for escape through Normandy . Around midnight of Fersen 's second day Marie Antoinette bade him farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under pressure from the Assembly , Louis declared war on Austria , which was preparing to invade France to restore Alsace ( occupied by the French ) and obtain full liberty for the royal family Rightly suspecting that the king and queen were plotting with the enemy an armed mob stormed the Tuileries on August 10 , killing more than a thousand guards and noblemen . Louis and his family fled on foot through a courtyard to the nearby Assembly building , where they begged the representatives for protection . <p> The Assembly however , voted to have the king , queen , their son and daughter , and the king 's sister Elisabeth locked up in the Temple tower , a forbidding medieval fortress in the center of Paris . On September 20 , the new revolutionary National Convention , the successor to the Assembly met for the first time . The following day they abolished the 1,000-year-old monarchy and established the Republic . <p> For the former royal family , now prisoners in the Temple tower , the next two months passed improbably in something like domestic tranquility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the dramas of Corneille and Racine , the queen gave Marie Thrse , 13 , history lessons , played chess with her husband , did needlework and even sang at the harpsichord . Then , on November 20 , Louis ' letters to foreign powers plotting counterrevolution were discovered in a strongbox hidden in the Tuileries . Louis was taken from his family , locked up on the floor below them and , on December 26 , put on trial . Maximilien Robespierre , a chief architect of the Revolution , and the fiery journalist Jean-Paul Marat were among the many radical leaders who testified against him during a three-week trial . " It is with regret that I pronounce the fatal truth , " proclaimed Robespierre , " Louis must die , so that the country may live .

But it was not to be . Louis , 38 , was condemned to death on January 16 , 1793 . He was allowed to spend a few hours with his wife , son , daughter and sister before being led to the guillotine on January 21 and executed before a crowd estimated at 20,000 . <p> Six months later , on August 2 , the Widow Capet , as Marie Antoinette was now known , was transferred to the Conciergerie , a dank prison dubbed " death 's antechamber . " Louis ' sister , Elisabeth , Marie Thrse and Louis Charles remained in the Temple tower . Later that month , the queen recognized among her visitors a former officer , the Chevalier Alexandre de Rougeville , who dropped at her feet one or two carnations ( accounts differ ) containing a note that said he would try to rescue her . A guard spotted the note , and when public prosecutor Antoine Fouquier-Tinville learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan became known as the Carnation Plot ) , he moved to put her immediately on trial . <p> Emaciated and pale , Marie Antoinette maintained her composure at the trial , a grueling 32-hour ordeal carried out over two days . She responded with eloquence to the prosecutor 's litany of accusations  --  she was guilty ; he said , of making secret agreements with Austria and Prussia ( which had joined with Austria in the war against France ) , of shipping money abroad to Louis ' two younger brothers in exile and of conspiring with these enemies against France . Accused of manipulating the king 's foreign policy , she coolly replied : " To advise a course of action and to have it carried out are very different things . " <p> On the first day of the trial , the prosecution delivered a bombshell , presenting testimony by young Louis that he had sex with his mother and his aunt .

" I appeal in this matter to all the mothers present in court . " The prosecutor 's ploy backfired as the audience reacted with abashed silence . But the trial 's conclusion was foregone . With civil war threatening to destroy the new Republic , " Marie Antoinette was deliberately targeted , " says Fraser in the PBS production , " in order to bind the French together in a kind of blood bond . " Found guilty of treason , the former queen was sentenced to die . <p> On the eve of her execution , Marie Antoinette wrote a last letter , to her sister-in-law , entreating Elisabeth to forgive young Louis for his accusations and to persuade him not to try to avenge his parents ' deaths . " I am calm , " she reflected , " as people are whose conscience is clear .

When the guillotine sliced off her head at 12:15 p.m. , thousands of spectators erupted in cheers . Her body was placed in a coffin and tossed into a common grave in a cemetery behind the Church of the Madeleine . <p> Still imprisoned in the Temple tower , Louis Charles remained isolated from his sister and his aunt , who was also executed , in May 1794 , as an enemy of the people .

But he never forgave himself for not saving the woman he loved on the flight to Varennes . " Why ah why did I not die for her on the 20th of June ? " he wrote in his journal .

Ultimately ; she was condemned simply for being Louis ' wife and a symbol of tyranny Thomas Jefferson , minister to France under Louis XVI , famously asserted that if Marie Antoinette had been cloistered in a convent , the French Revolution would never have taken place . Perhaps Jefferson goes too far . Certainly she became a scapegoat for nearly everything that was wrong with France 's absolutist , dynastic system .
