The Way of All Flesh <p> EVENTUALLY IT CAME TO PASS that no one ever had to die , so long as just one person loved them . The process that provided immortality was fueled that way . <p> Almost everybody can find someone to love him or her , at least for a little while , and if and when that someone says good-bye , most people can clean up their act enough to find yet another . <p> But every now and then you find a specimen who is so unlovable that he ca n't even get a hungry dog to take a biscuit from his hand . Babies take one look at him and get the colic . Women cross their legs as he passes by . Ardent homosexuals drop their collective gaze . Old people desperate for company feign sleep . <p> The most extreme such specimen was Custer Tralia . Custer came out of the womb with teeth , and bit the doctor . In grade school he broke up the love training sessions with highly toxic farts . He celebrated puberty by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high school , he made loving couples into enemies by spreading clever vicious lies . He formed a Masturbation Club and did n't allow anybody else to join . In his graduation yearbook , he was unanimously voted " The One Least Likely to Survive , If We Have Anything to Do with It . " <p> In college , he became truly reckless . When everybody else was feeling the first whiff of mortality and frantically seducing in self-defense , Custer declared that he hated women almost as much as he hated men , and he reveled in his freedom from love ; his superior detachment from the cloying crowd . Death was nothing compared to the hell of dependency . When , at the beginning of his junior year , he had to declare what his profession was going to be , he wrote down " hermit " for first , second , and third choices . <p> The world was getting pretty damned crowded , though , since a lot of people loved each other so much they turned out copy after copy of themselves . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian outback . He had a helicopter drop him there with a big water tank and crates of food . They said they 'd check back in a year , and Custer said do n't bother . If you 've decided not to live forever , a few years or decades one way or the other do n't make much difference . <p> He found peace among the wallabies and dingoes . A kangaroo began to follow him around , and he accepted it as a pet , sharing his rehydrated Kentucky Fried Chicken and fish and chips with it . <p> Life was a pleasantly sterile and objectless quest . Custer and his kangaroo quartered the outback , turning over rocks just to bother the things underneath . The kangaroo was loyal , which was a liability , but at least it could n't talk , and its attachment to Custer was transparently selfish , so they got along . He taught it how to beg , and , by not rewarding it , taught it how to whimper . <p> One day , like Robinson Crusoe , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction . <p> But the footprinter had been watching him for some time , and outsmarted him . Knowing he would be gone all day , she had started miles away , walking backward by his camp , and knew that his instinct for hermitage would lead him directly , perversely , back into her cave . <p> Parky Gumma had decided to become a hermit , too , after she read about Custer 's audacious gesture . But after about a year she wanted a bath , and someone to love her so she would n't die , in that order . So under the wheeling Milky Way , on the eve of the thirty-first century , she stalked backward to her cave , and squandered a month 's worth of water sluicing her body , which was unremarkable except for the fact that it was clean and the only female one in two hundred thousand square miles . <p> Parky left herself unclothed and squeaky clean , carefully perched on a camp stool , waiting for Custer 's curiosity and misanthropy to lead him back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise . <p> She stood up and spread her arms , and his pet kangaroo boinged away in terror . <p> Custer himself was paralyzed by a mixture of conflicting impulses . He had seen pictures of naked women , but never one actually in the flesh , and honestly did n't know what to do . <p> Parky showed him . <p> The rest is the unmaking of history . That Parky had admired him and followed him into the desert was even more endearing than the slip and slide that she demonstrated for him after she washed him up . But that was revolutionary , too . Custer had to admit that a year or a century or a millennium of that would be better than keeling over and having dingos tear up your corpse and spread your bones over the uncaring sands . <p> So this is Custer 's story , and ours . He never did get around to liking baths , so you could n't say that love conquers all . But it could still conquer death . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
