Lifting a finger ; feeling a son 's touch . For Christopher Reeve , seemingly simple moments add up to a medical marvel // Never let it be said that Christopher Reeve does n't know how to work an audience . In New Orleans to give a speech at a neuroscience conference in November 2000 , Reeve greeted his doctor , John McDonald , offstage and then paused dramatically . " I said , " I want to show you something you might find interesting , ' ' " Reeve recalls . As McDonald watched in awe , the actor slowly , deliberately raised the tip of his left index finger . " You would have thought , " Reeve says , " that I 'd walked on water . " Or-dare we say it ? - leaped a tall building in a single bound . Reeve cringes at Superman references , but his astounding progress makes it hard not to think of the role that catapulted him to stardom in 1978 . Since he was thrown headfirst from a horse in 1995 , Reeve has been paralyzed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every breath . At the time of the accident , doctors predicted he would never breathe on his own or regain any motor ability . But now , as he reveals in his new book Nothing Is Impossible : Reflections on a New Life as well as in a documentary airing Sept. 18 on ABC , he can wiggle toes on both feet , move the fingers of his left hand , raise his right hand 90 deg and sit ( albeit slightly slouched ) on the edge of a table for 30 minutes . In addition , he can breathe independently for up to 90 minutes at a time and distinguish between hot and cold , sharp and dull over much of his body . Best of all , he can feel the hugs he gets from wife Dana , 41 , an actress , their son Will , 10 , and Reeve 's children by his ex-girlfriend Gae Exton , Matthew , 22 ( who filmed the documentary ) , and Alexandra , 18 ( a Yale sophomore ) .

" His successes really lift his spirits . " // " I have n't been able to give Will a hug since he was 2 , " says Reeve , who turns 50 on Sept. 25 . " But now if he comes over and puts his hand on my hand , I absolutely feel it the way I used to . To be able to feel just the lightest touch is really a gift . " A gift indeed . But is it the first step toward a full recovery ? Even Dr. McDonald-medical director of the Spinal Cord Injury Program at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and creator of the Activity-Based Recovery Program Reeve has been following-does n't know for sure . What he does know is that " no one who has suffered an injury as severe as Chris 's and failed to have any initial recovery has regained the amount of motor and sensory function he has-not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the idea that electrical muscle stimulation combined with repetitive motion exercises might regenerate nervous-system cells , is the subject of an article this month in the prestigious Journal of Neurosurgery : Spine . ) Although only a postmortem analysis of his spinal-cord tissue could determine if any of Reeve 's nerve cells have regenerated , the actor 's recovery does appear " remarkable and bears further study , " says Dr. Jack Zigler , president-elect of the American Spinal Injury Association , who cautions , " One case does not make new science . " One thing is already clear : It took heroic effort for Reeve to get from the moment life as he knew it tragically changed to where he is today . The then 42-year-old was competing in a May 1995 equestrian contest in Virginia when his Thoroughbred stopped in mid-jump over a 3-ft. - high rail fence . Reeve was pitched forward and landed on his head , the weight of his 6 ' ' 4 " , 215-lb. body shattering his top two vertebrae . For five days , he drifted in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out that he was a quadriplegic . Over the next few years , he learned to master new challenges-operating his wheelchair by puffing into a tube and submitting to hours of physical therapy , including being stretched daily to control muscle spasms and maintain flexibility . Plagued by blood clots , a broken arm and a bout with pneumonia , partly because of inactivity and decreased circulation , " I made so many trips to the hospital the first few years , it was ridiculous , " Reeve recalls . Photograph It 's extraordinary what can happen in a pool , " says Reeve ( in aquatherapy in St. Louis ) . Photograph " I do n't like to fail , " says Reeve ( on his FES bike at home with nurse Bill Bernhev , left , and trainer Jim Hartigan ) . Photograph " I worried about not being able to succeed as a parent , " says Reeve ( with Will and Dana at a New York Liberty basketball game in August ) . " But we 've found ways to make it work . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer together , " says Matthew . Photograph // All the while , Dana remained by his side , even when it meant turning down tempting acting offers like a role in the 2000 Broadway musical The Full Monty , which would have required leaving the couple 's Bedford , N.Y. , home for the show 's six-month tryout in San Diego . " He 's an incredible human being , " Dana says . " Who would n't want to be with him ? " Reeve 's fortunes began to turn in the spring of 1999 , when he met McDonald at a medical fund-raiser . Intrigued by the neurologist 's theories , Reeve started riding a " functional electrical stimulation " bicycle three times a week for an hour Customized with electrodes that zap Reeve 's hamstrings , quadriceps and glutei , the FES bicycle essentially jolts those muscles into pushing the pedals . In addition , Reeve 's team of aides , including a nurse available at all hours , runs an electric muscle  --  stimulating machine over different parts of his body each day . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for . He and Dana were chatting , Reeve recalls , when " she noticed that the index finger on my left hand was moving . She said , Are you doing that on purpose ? ' I said no . She said , Try . ' I looked at the finger , and I remember literally trying to establish a connection with it . And it worked . It was unbelievable . " Recalls Dana : " We were both like , Where is this coming from ? " ' A follow-up MRI showed that when Reeve moved his finger , " the appropriate area of the brain activated , just like it would in a normal person , " McDonald , 39 , says . Thrilled and hopeful , " We ramped up the exercise and said , We 're going to see how far we can go , " ' says Reeve . In July 2001 McDonald added 90 minutes of aquatherapy once a week to Reeve 's regimen . During the first session , as aides held him up , Reeve was able to slowly kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People were cheering , " he says . " I 've been an actor since I was a kid , and this was definitely show time . " How much further he can progress remains unknown . " I 'm in the best health I 've been in since the accident , " says Reeve , whose osteoporosis has even been reversed , thanks to his fitness routine and medication . But there are practical obstacles to be surmounted : Reeve 's therapy and medical care are expensive-$400,000 a year  --  and his three health insurance policies , each of which has a cap of $1 million , run out in 2005 . " I 'll cross that bridge when I come to it , " he says . Besides , Reeve has other things on his mind , like campaigning for stem-cell research and health-insurance reform to help other spinal cord patients . Reeve , who last acted in a ' ' 98 TV remake of Rear Window , is also preparing for an upcoming directing project . He still believes , against the odds , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting against him . " The fact that he 's having some recovery could make that a possibility , " McDonald says . Meanwhile , Reeve spends as much time as possible with Will , " coaching him in hockey and baseball , going to every game I can , " he says , adding proudly : " I taught him to ride his bike just by talking to him . " Whatever the future holds , Reeve is acutely aware of what matters now . " Even if your body does n't work the way it used to , the heart and the mind and the spirit are not diminished , " he says . " It 's as simple as that .
