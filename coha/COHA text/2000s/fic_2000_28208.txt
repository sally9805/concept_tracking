Death Is Not the End The fifty-six-year-old American poet , a Nobel Laureate , a poet known in American literary circles as ' the poet 's poet ' or sometimes simply ' the Poet , ' lay outside on the deck , bare-chested , moderately overweight , in a partially reclined deck chair , in the sun , reading , half supine , moderately but not severely overweight , winner of two National Book Awards , a National Book Critics Circle Award , a Lamont Prize , two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts , a Prix de Rome , a Lannan Foundation Fellowship , a MacDowell Medal , and a Mildred and Harold Strauss Living Award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters , a president emeritus of PEN , a poet two separate American generations have hailed as the voice of their generation , now fifty-six , lying in an unwet XL Speedo-brand swimsuit in an incrementally reclinable canvas deck chair on the tile deck beside the home 's pool , a poet who was among the first ten Americans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. and Catherine T.

The home 's pool and deck area is surrounded on three sides by trees and shrubbery . The trees and shrubbery , installed years before , are densely interwoven and tangled and serve the same essential function as a redwood privacy fence or a wall of fine stone . It is the height of spring , and the trees and shrubbery are in full leaf and are intensely green and still , and are complexly shadowed , and the sky is wholly blue and still , so that the whole enclosed tableau of pool and deck and poet and chair and table and trees and home 's rear faade is very still and composed and very nearly wholly silent , the soft gurgle of the pool 's pump and drain and the occasional sound of the poet clearing his throat or turning the pages of Newsweek magazine the only soundsnot a bird , no distant lawn mowers or hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled sounds from the pools of the homes on either side of the poet 's homenothing but the pool 's respiration and poet 's occasional cleared throat , wholly still and composed and enclosed , not even a hint of a breeze to stir the leaves of the trees and shrubbery , the silent living enclosing flora 's motionless green vivid and inescapable and not like anything else in the world in either appearance or suggestion.3 * * * 1 . Also the first American-born poet ever in the Nobel Prize for Literature 's distinguished 94-year history to receive it , the coveted Nobel Prize for Literature . 2 . Never the recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship , however : thrice rejected early in his career , he had reason to believe that something personal and/or political was afoot with the Guggenheim Fellowship committee , and had decided that he 'd simply be damned , starve utterly , before he would ever again hire a graduate assistant to fill out the tiresome triplicate Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship application and go through the tiresome contemptible farce of ' objective ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true .
