NEW YORK  --  Even Monday 's monster rally on top of two weeks of steady gains ca n't dull the pain of a brutal fact : Behind the battered stock market 's most gruesome statistic  --  $9.3 trillion in vanished wealth  --  are the life-altering stories of investors who have lost lots of money . <p> For the second time this decade , the U.S. stock market has suffered a historic 50% swoon , testing the staying power of even the most committed long-term investors . Shaken by a severe global recession and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , many investors are rethinking the way they manage their money and are ratcheting down risk . <p> The human faces behind the shrinking account balances are portraits in pain and dashed dreams , and offer an intimate glimpse into an uncertain financial future : <p> *Margaret Schaefer , 71 , a retired teacher from Dearborn , Mich. , recently took a part-time teaching job to avoid dipping into her retirement account , which has lost a third of its value . <p> *Robert Muse , 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks have plunged nearly 70% , says he wo n't feel financially secure until he has $50,000 tucked away in government-insured certificates of deposit . <p> *Dan Cobb , a 61-year-old retiree , says he feels " too guilty " to buy a new motorcycle because his wife is still working and his cracked nest egg is down half-a-million bucks . <p> *Frank Baker , 59 , a computer analyst who has seen his holdings dwindle to $500,000 from $1.2 million , worries that he may have to start looking for a job in two years when his current contract expires , rather than retire as planned . <p> *Grace Cooling , 42 , a Houston-based engineer who still believes in stocks for the long run  --  despite losing " hundreds of thousands of dollars " in her 401(k)  --  sums up the angst felt by many Americans whose financial futures are riding on stocks : " My biggest fear is that my investments may not recover . " <p> The Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 497 points Monday on the Treasury 's plan to rid the U.S. financial system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in two weeks . But since its October 2007 peak , the most popular barometer of the U.S. market still is down nearly 6,400 points , a bruising that has prompted investors to reassess the widely accepted view that owning stocks is the best path to long-term wealth . <p> " The equity culture is coming under attack , " Robert Buckland , chief global equity strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management , wrote in his March outlook . <p> Indeed , despite a recent 19% rally off of the March 9 low , investment pros still wonder if the gains will last and if investors once-insatiable appetite for stocks will ever return . They fear a new investing landscape marked by a more defensive approach and less risk-taking will emerge . <p> Some stock strategists , such as Jason Trennert of Strategas Research Partners , warn that retail investors may not return to the stock market in a meaningful way for a generation . <p> Of course , there are investors , such as David Brno , a 41-year-old financial analyst from Arlington , Mass. , who believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say now is the time to buy , not sell stocks . " You get a great buying opportunity like this once in a generation , " Brno says . <p> Keeping faith in the stock model <p> There are also investors like 40-year-old Jeffrey Banks , who think " time is on their side . " Or Vikas Arora , 44 , who has not lost faith in the power of capitalism and still believes buying stocks on a regular basis , even in tough times  --  a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging  --  will prove profitable over the long haul . <p> In fact , 12 of the 20 individual investors interviewed by USA TODAY for this story said they had not lost faith in the stock market , bailed out of stocks , or gone totally defensive with their stock portfolios . <p> They are confident the market will bounce back  --  eventually . Many investors are reluctant to get out now , fearing they will sell at or near the bottom . They do n't want to miss out when the turn comes . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schaefer says . <p> That line of reasoning makes sense , says Bob Dickey , an analyst at RBC Wealth Management . In a recent report titled " Do n't Sell at the Bottom , " he advises investors to " resist the temptation to do anything hasty at this relatively late stage of the bear cycle . " <p> Still , signs of a stock market exodus are evident in the mutual fund world . Retail fund investors , long considered staunch supporters of a buy-and-hold investment strategy , have been fleeing the stock market in droves . In the week ended March 11 , the most recent data available , investors yanked a net $22.1 billion out of stock funds , according to estimates from the Investment Company Institute , an industry trade group . That was the sixth straight week of outflows , putting stock funds on track for their ninth month of outflows in the past 10 months . <p> Indeed , spooked by the massive wealth destruction on Wall Street and the uncertain outlook for the crippled U.S. economy , many investors are now more interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a killing in the stock market . <p> After watching the value of his stock portfolio dive between $750,000 and $1 million , Harry Nieman , a 72-year-old ex-banker , for example , now spends a lot of time searching for CDs that pay the highest yields . <p> Nieman is not alone in his hunt for safe , yet low-yielding , CDs . There was $1.36 trillion parked in CDs as of March 2 , up more than 11% from a year ago , according to Federal Reserve data . The average yield on a one-year CD was 1.37% as of last week , says Bankrate.com . While that pales in comparison with the 10% long-term average annual return of stocks , many investors are willing to give up some potential upside just as long as they know they will get back their initial investment principal . <p> A move into cash at the right time <p> Similarly , more than a year ago , Carl Emerling , 58 , a pharmaceutical worker from Lakeland , Fla. , bailed out of stocks completely and put 100% of his cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially " second-guessed " but now happily equates with " winning the lottery . " The move allowed him to avoid massive losses . <p> Deposits to money market mutual funds have also soared . There is now $3.86 trillion on the sidelines sitting in money market funds , just below the record $3.92 trillion hit the second week of January , according to Crane Data , which tracks money market flows . At the end of 2008 , balances and contributions in stable value and money market funds were up 70% from a year earlier , a study by Mercer found . <p> The cash buildup is a clear sign of investors desperate search for safety , says Peter Crane , president of Crane Data . " The current mantra is that in a more dangerous world you have to hold more cash , " Crane says . <p> That heightened risk aversion is a big reason why the amount of 401(k) assets held in stocks near the end of 2008 was at an all-time low of 53.8% , according to Hewitt Associates . That is down from 68.1% a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 . The steep drop in stock assets is also due to plunging stock prices . <p> " It probably is the buying opportunity of a lifetime , " says Bob Cording , 76 , a retiree from Kingsport , Tenn . " We have saved cash to reinvest , but I 'm too chicken at this time . " <p> Investor uncertainty remains high . There is still no clear sense of how the financial crisis will play out , whether stocks have finally hit bottom , or if President Obama 's economic team , the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department have the right prescription to fix what ails the economy and banking sector . <p> " I would not say I am convinced that we have turned the corner , " admits retired lawyer J. Sean Keenan , 66 , of Canton , Ohio , who says he has not lost faith in stocks despite being burned by the crash of financial stocks such as insurer American International Group and Citigroup . " I 'm sitting and watching and hoping for the best . I 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have investments with ( Bernie ) Madoff , " who pleaded guilty to a $65 billion Ponzi scheme that left many investors with nothing . <p> Adds Baker : " I guess I am starting to feel that my 30 years of work will go down the toilet . " <p> Despite all the fears surrounding the potential for stocks to fall again , make a lower low and scare the pants off already frightened investors , not all individuals have given up on stocks as the best long-term road to building wealth . <p> And not all investors have given up on the Warren Buffet style of investing , which involves summoning up the courage in scary times to buy stocks at what some perceive as fire-sale prices in the hopes of netting a big profit years down the road . " You have to have faith that the system will work its way out of this , " Keenan says . " The market will go up again , and when it does go up , that is when you make money .
