GOOD NEWS : 50 IS N'T OLD ANYMORE // YOU MAKE EVERYTHING COUNT . Like Bonnie Allison . When she was 50 , she became the oldest woman to complete the Race Across America ( RAAM ) . But she had to overcome much more than just the 2,909-mile route . During the 1992 race , with 680 miles to go , she was hit by a pickup truck and seriously injured . The two ruptured discs in her neck and smashed nerves in her hand would have been enough to stop most cyclists . But after hearing that her leg was not broken , Allison told her crew , " We 're gon na take me to the hospital and get me sewed up and I 'm gon na finish the race-I 've got to see that finish line . " She spent a few years fully recovering but in the past six years has begun racing in duathlons . For Allison and others beginning their sixth decade , it 's not too late to become active-heck , Allison did n't even own a bike until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 is n't old anymore . " I never , ever let my age have any bearing on what I do , " says Allison . " You just have to reprogram yourself . You can have the same benefits from exercise as a 40-year-old . You just ca n't keep reminding yourself of your age . Do n't let age be a factor . " Instead , age should be the reason you stay active . Years ago , fifty was considered old not because people aged fast , but because infectious diseases such as flu , pneumonia and tuberculosis killed most people off by then . Lucky for us , modern medicine has all but eliminated such diseases . Our expanding lifespan has shown us that we now contract other afflictions such as heart disease , cancer and stroke . At 50 , you have at least a third of your life left and more time to make those years your most active and healthy yet . While nothing will stop aging , there 's a lot you can do to slow it down and minimize its effects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least four days a week , and every day would n't hurt . Putting in at least 30 minutes a day on the bike is easy And training for a longer ride , organized ride or race is a great way to set a concrete goal and ride on a regular basis . " I think the reason I was successful , " Allison says , " was I never cut short a scheduled training ride . I did n't say ' I can make up those miles tomorrow . ' " But be honest with yourself . " You should n't say ' I can ride 10 miles , so I can do 50 . ' When you set a smaller , more realistic goal and accomplish that goal , you feel better about yourself , " she says . " That 's when you want to raise the goal and add a few more miles . I 'm learning to swim because I plan to compete in two Ironman triathlons in the next 10 years . " Cycling fights aging in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows it to beat less frequently but pump the same amount of blood . Starting this process early makes everyday tasks easier on your body now while reducing chances of heart disease and stroke later in life . Cycling also strengthens your lungs by slowing the natural reduction in V02 max as much as four times its usual rate . So , by the time you turn 70 , you could potentially have stronger lungs than an unfit person more than 30 years younger . Another benefit : According to the American Association for Cancer Research , women who get regular exercise from their 50s on may reduce their chance of developing breast cancer by as much as 67 percent . And men who bum more than 200 calories a day may reduce their risk of developing erectile dysfunction , according to a study by the Boston University School of Medicine and New England Research Institutes . Along with the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular benefits of riding , cyclists also have increased mobility and flexibility . Regular stretching programs before and after a workout become vital to getting maximum potential from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your range of motion is lacking , and focus your attention on those muscle groups . Most important , do n't forget to have fun , Allison says . Do n't ride by yourself . " I really enjoy the social part of cycling , " she says . " People are hesitant to ask me for help because I can ride 3,000 miles , so they think I ca n't go ride 10 with them . That 's just not true . If I know someone is really interested , I do n't mind going 5 or 10 miles to show them what to do . " Sidebar LEARNING NEW TRICKS Sidebar The myth is that you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks . As Allison knows , you can still learn well into your 50s . Here are the three most-important elements to expanding your mind as you grow older : Regular physical activity Friends and family who support your efforts Belief in your own abilities Sidebar THE REAR DERAILLEUR IS 57 Campagnolo introduced the Corsa derailleur , which eventually became the high-end racing Paris  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good If you 've never raced before . you do Instead of one more bike . you buy the home gym Big Decision : I'l take the one with the triple Health and fitness over speed and strength But sometimes speed and strength Sidebar Because you do n't have all that many hammers left to drop . when you let one go . you make sure it makes someone hurt Usually yourself You take that cycling vacation you imagined when you were 20 Everyone in the local riding circuit knows you Recover harder than you ride Ten-person race fields mean you do n't have to line up 30 minutes early for a front-row start It feels like flying Sidebar You finally get your spouse on a bike Long Ride : To remember and honor the first friend who dies too early You hold an office in the local cycling club I 'm really glad I did n't become a bike messenger Fashion Statement : Yeah-my ass still looks good in spandex You give your kid the bike you wish your parents had bought you And you realize it 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? // <p>
