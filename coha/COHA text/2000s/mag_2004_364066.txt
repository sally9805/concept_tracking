Did Islamic terrorism win the Spanish election ? If you support the Iraq war and do n't turn apoplectic when hearing the word Bush , you will nod vigorously and reach for your Spanish dictionary to look up appeasement . But if you hate both the war and the Bushies , you will argue thus : " A vast majority of Spaniards have always opposed their country 's entanglement in Iraq . The vote merely expressed the will of the people . " But this is a moot debate . Look at the issue from the terrorists ' perspective . Having timed the bloodbath for the election , they scored beyond their wildest expectations . Spain is no longer ruled by a pro-U.S. government , and a pillar of the Iraq coalition has collapsed . On the first anniversary of the start of the Iraq war , every European government is on notice . The message : Distance yourself from the Great Satan  --  or else . We are back in business , and we can strike in the heart of Europe . <P> Not bad for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You might comfort yourself by drawing a line between the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq . That is what the incoming Spanish government has done . Though it is apparently set on withdrawing from Iraq , it will not bolt from the antiterrorism coalition . But the terrorists do n't accept that distinction . For them , the key battlefield is Iraq . The thrust of their strategy is to break up the U.S.-led coalition . They live by a simple maxim : " The worse , the better . " <P> That strategy was foreshadowed by the multiple attacks on Iraqi Shi'ites a few weeks ago . The terrorists hoped to set off civil war among the Shi'ites , Kurds and Sunnis . The good news is that the Shi'ites did not choose to launch a spasm of counterviolence but instead signed the draft interim Iraqi constitution . In other words , the strategy of Terror International does not seem to be achieving its desired effect where it matters most  --  in Iraq . Nor should its strategy be allowed to bear fruit in the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liberate Iraq ; they want to enslave it in the name of a demented dream . Their vision was articulated in a postattack video , purportedly created by al-Qaeda , in which the group 's " military spokesman for Europe " told the Europeans , " You love life , we love death . " How do you negotiate with nihilism ? <P> You ca n't . You have to fight it while respecting two rules . First , do not destroy the precious freedoms of liberal democracy while fighting their enemies . Second , if the enemy is a complicated network , the defense has to build networks of its own . That requires sustained cooperation among all democracies , something the Bush Administration has learned a bit late in the game . <P> After the Madrid bombing , even the German government , which consistently opposed the Iraq war , came around to this recognition . A senior German official , quoted in the Wall Street Journal , said , " If ... you can plant a big bomb in Europe , cause a government to fall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong signal to terrorists . " He added , " That 's not in Germany 's interests or in Europe 's or in Spain 's . " Winston Churchill put it more concisely : " An appeaser is one who feeds the crocodile hoping he will eat him last .
