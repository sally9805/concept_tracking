Section : Money &; Business ; Personal Finance Guide News You Can Use <p> We are a nation of givers . Last year , as the stock market lost nearly a quarter of its value , as millions of people lost jobs , and as many others lost sleep worrying about terrorism and imminent war , Americans nonetheless gave a record $241 billion to charitable causes . While foundations and corporations contributed a good chunk of the philanthropic pie , the overwhelming majority of those billions  --  more than 80 percent  --  was given by ordinary Americans . Tapping a vast national reservoir of goodwill , two thirds of households , rich and poor , reached deep into their pockets last year and pulled out an average gift of $2,499 , according to estimates from Giving USA , a publication of the American Association of Fundraising Counsel Trust for Philanthropy . <p> The bulk of the nation 's largess  --  35 percent  --  goes to religious institutions , followed by education , which nets 13 percent of our generosity . We give not just of our money but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , about 84 million people , volunteers to feed the hungry , coach the kids , and comfort the sick . <p> These are figures to be proud of , to be sure . But you 're about to be asked for even more . The number of nonprofits nationwide is now a staggering 1.6 million . That 's more than the entire population of Idaho and a 60 percent increase in the past decade alone . But while the nonprofit count is up , state budgets  --  on which many charities , especially those serving the needy , rely for grants  --  are down . Some experts predict state shortfalls will reach $80 billion next year , piling still more tasks on already stretched social-service organizations ( Page 58 ) . And though Americans gave a bit more last year than in 2001 , the rate of giving remained where it 's been for years , at about 2 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product . " There 's more competition for the charitable dollar , " says Bennett Weiner , chief operating officer of the Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that means more " give now ! " appeals in the mailbox and more fundraising calls , as charities desperately try to distinguish themselves from their do-good brethren . " We know you 're being bombarded by more groups than ever , " says William Swindell , associate executive director of development for Father Flanagan 's Girls and Boys Town in Boys Town , Neb . " We want to be on your short list . " To that end , his group is mounting a campaign to thank longtime donors  --  even folks who 've given $100 annually for years can expect a call  --  and using lures like discounted tickets to black-tie galas to get the next generation hooked on giving . <p> Compounding charities ' scramble for donors is the looming promise of an economic turnaround . There will be " a more intense solicitation during this holiday period , " says Eugene Tempel , executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University . " An economic pickup enhances the prospect that donors might respond . " <p> With more solicitations , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular conundrum  --  even as Americans ' generosity has grown , our faith in nonprofits has sunk . Widespread disappointment with the handling of September 11-related donations and a spate of recent scandals involving nonprofits  --  from overpaid trustees to outright embezzlement  --  have hammered home the point that the money and trust we place in charities can easily be abused ( Page 60 ) . In August 2002 , the Brookings Institution found that 16 percent of Americans had no confidence in charitable institutions , up from half that in July 2001 . " There is no SEC for nonprofits , " says Daniel Borochoff , president of the watchdog group American Institute of Philanthropy . <p> But for every rotten apple in the nonprofit barrel , there are many more that uphold high standards . The problem , especially with so many groups angling for assistance , is picking one . A BBB study found , in fact , that 70 percent of donors have trouble determining a charity 's legitimacy . Add to that the vast array of giving options  --  Do you want to give your money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task can seem overwhelming . <p> It 's likely you already know which religious or educational institution will get your gift . Making other giving decisions can be tough , but the effort is worthwhile . " Donation is an investment in your community and your world , and you do n't want it wasted , " says Tracy Thorleifson , a lawyer with the Federal Trade Commission . And what a rare treat : Charitable giving , whether of $1 or $1 million , gives each of us a chance to affect the greater good . U.S. News talked to philanthropic experts for advice on ensuring that your charitable investments are sound : <p> Identify a cause : It 's the most basic decision a donor can make . What do you care about ? It may be an issue that reflects passionately held beliefs or personal experience . " I know what it is to be hungry , " says Vanessa Lazar , 30 , whose yearlong brush with homelessness prompted her and her friends to start raising money for starving Ethiopians . " To think of someone going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , losing a family member to lymphoma may spur one to support cancer research , while a nature buff may want to help conserve wildlife . <p> After narrowing down a cause , investigate organizations working in that area . To aid your search , U.S. News has partnered with the philanthropic research service GuideStar to provide a searchable database of more than 800,000 public charities at www.usnews.com/charity . The process may seem daunting . Thousands of groups may be working on your particular cause . A keyword search for " literacy , " for instance , results in over 2,700 organizations , from Books for a Better World , a Phoenix group that builds libraries in developing countries , to First Book , a Washington , D.C. , outfit that gives books to low-income children in the United States . <p> Pare that universe down with a series of questions : Do you want to give locally , nationally , or internationally ? Will your gift support research or provide direct service ? Are you more comfortable with a big organization or a small group on a shoestring budget ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're refining your own giving goals . <p> After losing her mother to cancer in 1986 , Dacia Kruse , a manager at the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce , donated regularly to the American Cancer Society . But in 1998 , the 31-year-old discovered a program called Harvest of Books . Now , each October , she buys books for local students . " I feel like my $50 is worth more to Harvest of Books than to the American Cancer Society , " says Kruse of the rush she gets from making a bigger splash in a smaller pool . " It 's not rational , but now I feel good after I 've given . " <p> Nailing down your cause also makes it easier to turn down other pleas . " You can say no because you 've already figured out how you 're going to support this cause that 's dear to your heart , " says the FTC 's Thorleifson . What 's more , proactive giving means you 're less likely to fall victim to overly emotional entreaties  --  a favorite ploy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause and rounded up the groups that appear to be working toward the same goal . Picking among them can be perplexing because , unlike businesses , nonprofit organizations ca n't be judged by a single bottom line . Rather , a group 's impact rests on a complex brew of its goals , finances , and sphere of influence . Ultimately , too , the choice of where to give is personal . " Each of us comes at it with our own values , based on our own circumstances , and with our own expectations , " says GuideStar President Robert Ottenhoff . <p> Still , one rule always applies : Verify , first , that the organization is certified a nonprofit by the Internal Revenue Service , crucial to obtaining a tax deduction for your donation ( Page 56 ) . Not all nonprofits are 501(c) ( 3 ) ' s . Gifts to lobbying groups like the Sierra Club , for example , are not deductible , while donations to the Sierra Club Foundation , the group 's nonadvocacy arm , are . Confirming a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto popular names , hoping for mistaken donations . <p> Experts also suggest giving to groups you know . " There really is a logical reason why people give to their alma maters , " says Christine Letts , associate director of Harvard 's Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations . Volunteering is another prime way to learn about the inner workings of an organization . Andrew Schechtman , a 36-year-old family practitioner in San Jose , Calif. , volunteered in Liberia for a year with the international health group Doctors Without Borders , treating malnutrition , malaria , and war wounds . Now , safely back in the States , Schechtman donates money to the group . " I know from experience that they 're stingy , " he says , " so I know my money 's going to be well spent . " <p> Failing firsthand experience , donors can consult community foundations , which make grants to local nonprofits in more than 650 areas nationwide . " We can connect you with staff who have expertise in the area you 're exploring , " says Stuart Appelbaum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council on Foundations ' Web site ( www.cof.org ) lists community foundations that you can tap for assistance . Finally , quiz family and friends . A pal on the board of a women 's shelter , for instance , can give you the skinny . <p> Charity-rating services can also be helpful . The BBB , for example , assesses national groups on 20 different standards , from fundraising efficiency to board governance . Every quarter , it produces a list ( www.give.org ) denoting whether groups have met its standards . AIP grades charities on similar measures , publishing the names of its top-ranked groups at www.charitywatch.org . ( A full report , which includes those graded C and below , is available for $3 . ) Charity Navigator also rates over 2,500 groups at www.charitynavigator.org . <p> But rating services cover only the largest or most-asked-about charities . And because standards differ , watchdogs may disagree . For example , Shriners Hospital for Children met the BBB 's criteria , but got an F from AIP for hoarding enough cash to fund over 13 years of programs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the investment that produces the income to pay for our hospital budget so we do n't pass any costs onto our patients , " says Executive Vice President Lewis Molnar . Standards on that most controversial of benchmarks  --  the percentage of a charity 's expenses spent on program services  --  also vary . The BBB says groups should spend at least 65 percent of gifts on programs , while AIP and Charity Navigator say 75 percent . <p> The premium put on how much money goes toward program services is a sore point for many nonprofits . " Donors often want 100 percent of a gift to go directly to fund programs , " says Indiana 's Tempel . " But every organization has to pay utilities , rent , staff , and all the infrastructure pieces necessary to run a good organization . " And expenses vary widely among charities . According to Charity Navigator , museums spend , on average , 18 percent of their expenses on pricey necessities such as high-profile collections and tony galleries . Food banks , which funnel donated food to the needy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You need to compare food banks to food banks and museums to museums , " says Charity Navigator executive director Trent Stamp . " They operate fundamentally differently . " <p> Details , details . Donors can also run their own background checks by perusing a charity 's tax form . A third of the nation 's nonprofits take in more than $25,000 , which means they must complete IRS Form 990 . Trouble is , the data on the forms are not consistent . A 2002 General Accounting Office study , for example , found that 64 percent of charities listed no fundraising expenses at all . Still , the 990s are chock full of details about a charity 's finances , listing helpful nuggets like the amount of individual contributions and top officers ' salaries . Some nonprofits spell out , say , how much they spent on bank fees or insurance . Legally , charities must disclose 990s to the public . <p> While finances are important , they 're just one way of judging a charity 's effectiveness . Equally critical is whether the group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' We 're going to give people better housing ' " is a noble aim , says GuideStar 's Ottenhoff . But a better target would be : " ' Next year , we 're going to rehabilitate 1,000 apartments and provide them to families with at least two children , at a cost of $5,000 per apartment . " ' Such specifics should be detailed in the group 's annual report , on its Web site , or in any requests for donations . <p> Donors may feel shy about being nosy , but the best answers can come from nonprofit staffers themselves . " I called a local nonprofit last week and asked , Why should I donate to this group ? ' " says the FTC 's Thorleifson . " The guy nearly fell out of his chair . " But his response was informed and passionate enough to persuade her to give . Another telling query : " What percentage of your board wrote a check to the organization ? " says Renata Rafferty , author of Do n't Just Give It Away , who contends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much each member gave is inconsequential . The point is whether board members believe in the organization enough to put their own money into it and thus whether they are motivated to keep a close eye on the books . " What do they care , " asks Rafferty , " if someone ripped off a million dollars if it 's not their million dollars ? " <p> Response to such inquiries varies . A U.S. News reporter called several groups , identified herself as a potential donor , and asked what percentage of board members donated . An executive assistant at America 's Second Harvest answered cheerily : " All 17 members of the board contribute . " Staffers at Easter Seals and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation were stymied but promised to call back with an answer  --  and did . ( All board members of both groups give . ) <p> What to give : So you 've narrowed down the beneficiary of your largess . But in what form should your gift be ? The majority of Americans  --  the nearly two thirds of givers who do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice most nonprofits appreciate . " Our mainstay since 1917 has been lots of small donors , not a few very large , wealthy donors , " says Father Flanagan 's Swindell . <p> Folks forking over substantial sums might consider a planned gift . Start a charitable gift annuity , for instance , and earn an income off your donation . Return rates , calculated in part on actuarial tables , rise with age ( a 55-year-old earns 5.5 percent , while those 90 years and over get 11.3 percent ) . <p> Gloria Clinton , a 64-year-old property manager in Salinas , Calif. , used the sale of a condominium in 1999 to fund a charitable remainder trust with the Rotary Foundation . She took a partial deduction for the $150,000 sale price and now receives an annual income of 6 percent . When she and her husband pass away , the remainder goes to Rotary . " I wanted to do something that would help others eventually , " says Clinton . " I do n't like the stock market . I like knowing I 'll get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather spread the wealth , consider a donor-advised fund . Community foundations have been offering these vehicles for decades , but many finance firms got into the game in the 1990s . Donors to Fidelity 's Charitable Gift Fund , for example , make an irrevocable gift of at least $10,000 ( Vanguard 's Charitable Endowment Fund minimum is $25,000 ) . The giver gets an immediate tax deduction for the amount , then makes grants from the fund at leisure . Gibbs LaMotte sold a real-estate consulting business in 1997 and put over $150,000 into a Vanguard charitable fund . Now the 62-year-old and his wife use the cache to make gifts each year to a number of nonprofits . " It 's like a parking space for the money while you figure out who to give it to . " Most fund programs let you pick from among several types of investment pools . Vanguard 's Total Equity pool , for instance , has returned 17.38 percent year to date . <p> Money is n't everything . Many cash-strapped groups seek used computers . A list of them can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to erase the hard drive , and get a receipt from the group for tax purposes . Cellphones can also be recycled . Send your old mobile to CollectiveGood in Tucker , Ga. , and designate a charity from the list at www.collectivegood.com . CollectiveGood will send half the phone 's resale price ( $3 to $4 ) to the charity . <p> No matter the item , you can deduct only its fair market value , or the amount it would fetch for sale . Determining the worth of low-value items is up to you . The Salvation Army posts a helpful guide at www.salvationarmy.org ( sofas can fetch from $35 to $200 ; children 's sweaters , $2.50 to $8 ) . Be honest about the item 's condition . Every year , the northeastern division of the Salvation Army spends $4 million disposing of broken and unusable refrigerators , computers , and tires . " If you would n't give it to your best friend or your neighbor , " says Lt. Col. Timothy Raines , " then we probably ca n't use it either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts . But their popularity has spawned shady operators . Many cars are processed through for-profit vendors , who sometimes give as little as 10 percent of the sale price to charity . But some charities do their own dealing . Last year , Volunteers of America received more than 75,000 vehicles ( **25;2456;TOOLONG ) . " It 's much more cost-effective for us to do it ourselves , " says Jim Hartman , national director of the vehicle donation program , noting that his group receives 100 percent of each gift and will pick up vehicles nationwide . <p> Donating time : Many charities , especially struggling or smaller groups , could n't survive without volunteers . State budget cuts have forced the Vision homeless shelter in Luzerne County , Pa. , to lay off several staffers . Without a roster of 3,000 volunteers to undertake tasks like supervising overnight shifts , the shelter  --  now housing 35 men  --  would close its doors . <p> Many firms are making it easier for employees to offer their time . Timberland , an outdoor clothing company in Stratham , N.H. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time each year . Recent projects include building baseball parks in Valley , Ala. , and painting schools in Baltimore . " It gives me great pride , " says Carolyn Casey , director of social enterprise . " And it motivates the heck out of me . " <p> If your office does n't sponsor such a program , visit www.volunteermatch.org , where more than 26,000 nonprofits post gigs , from long-term tutoring stints to one-day homebuilding sessions . In 1999 , VolunteerMatch hooked up expert knitter and crocheter RuthVolk , 42 , with Bundles of Love , an Apple Valley , Minn. , group that provides handmade baby clothes to low-income parents . Now she 's on the board and devotes 100 hours a month to the group and its mission . Perhaps summing up the enduring appeal of American philanthropy , she says , " It 's addicting to know you 're needed .
