This Month 's Mailbox Dear Readers : Our February weddings issue prompted so many questions and comments about wedding attire and etiquette that we 've decided to devote this month 's Letters page to a few of them . As these letters suggest , choosing what to wear to a wedding or deciding what is appropriate is often difficult , but . awareness of tradition can be helpful-especially if you plan on breaking with it . TIME YOUR ATTIRE I am invited to a 3:00 P.M. wedding . The reception is at 6:00 P.M. at a very fine restaurant . Would it be okay to wear a suit to the ceremony and then a dress to the reception ? ARLYN H. , via e-mail Either outfit is fine for either event as long as both are dressy . However , there is no need to change outfits just because there are two separate functions-you can almost always wear the same thing to both . I 've been invited to attend an outdoor afternoon wedding on Marthas Vineyard this fall and would like to know what attire you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATRICIA M. , Houston , TX For a guest at an afternoon fall wedding , we suggest an understated yet polished look , such as a light-colored knee-length sheath dress with a matching coat or jacket . Linda Allard Ellen Tracy has great ones made from a double-faced light wool in a number of colors . You can accessorize with a pearl necklace and pearl earrings . For the rehearsal dinner , you could wear something more relaxed , like a colorful chiffon skirt with a lightweight cashmere twinset by Ralph Lauren . SUIT YOURSELF My sister has asked me to help make choices for her wedding , a small day function with a morning ceremony and an afternoon reception . Would it be acceptable for the groom and his attendants to wear regular two-button suits with conventional shirts and ties ? I was considering an Armani suit in midnight blue , black oxfords , and a French-cuff shirt and tie from Hermes . Also , what pattern of shirt and tie would work ? STEPHEN T. , via e-mail Congratulations ! Your choice of attire for the groom and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the men wear navy suits , striped shirts with a white or pale-blue background and solid woven ties . The colors of the stripes would help determine the tie color . Also , be sure to factor in the color of the bridesmaids ' dresses and flowers to create a harmonious effect overall . Then you 'll be ready to walk down the aisle in style . A WEDDING PROPOSAL I totally disagree with the tradition that the mother of the groom must be third in importance after the bride and her mother . I have two sons , and by following that idea , I will always be left out . This should change ! Somebody someplace , please change this rule . JENNIFER L. , via e-mail COLOR CONUNDRUMS My fiance and I have never been married , nor do we have children . Is it okay for me to wear a bright-pink wedding gown ? HOLLY E. , via e-mail Pale pink might be okay , but in general , brides stay away from bright colors . What shades and styles of attire would be appropriate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , via e-mail Anything that does n't upstage what the mothers of the bride and groom are wearing and that is n't white or black would be suitable . Our son 's fiancee has chosen lovely black dresses for her attendants . Her mother and I are wondering what we should wear . I 'm against our wearing black , but we are in a quandary . JANE L. , St. Louis , MO Since neither the bride 's nor the groom 's mother is in the wedding party , each may wear whatever she likes . WHY BALK AT BLACK ? Town &; Country remains one of my favorite publications , but I was somewhat dismayed at the advice that wearing black to a wedding " still does n't seem quite right , so avoid it " " Editor 's Letter , " February . I ca n't think of a more considerate way to treat a bride dressed in white than to wear a tasteful , conservative black dress to a fall or winter evening wedding . Other colors draw attention away from the bride . I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have about wearing black . When it is worn appropriately and respectfully , nothing is more suitable for almost any occasion . AUDRA T. , New York , NY Sidebar <p>
