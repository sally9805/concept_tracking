Preface &; Dedication <p> Late last night , January of 2001 , temperatures on this Vermont hill farm dropped below zero . Jeff was in the loft of our cabin , sleeping under two blankets and a down comforter , while downstairs in my pajamas and slippers , with a blanket draped over my head and around my shoulders , I stepped outside onto the deck . Immediately , the cold slipped under my bare heels , gripped them and sealed them over , like water freezing to black ice . The stars above me shone brighter than any dream or hope I could remember having  --  all but one . Ice in the nearby river popped and sighed ; snow around me glowed . The moon seemed close enough to touch , but promised to be cold , so cold that my fingers might stick to it , as they would to a cube of ice , or to the inside of a freezer door . <p> I 'm thirty years old . I turned twenty-eight and twenty-nine behind hospital white walls and blue glass windows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward . I watched through one weakly colored glass door as a nine-month-old baby was infused with enough chemo to kill a draft horse . I watched through another glass door as an engaged couple slipped rings on each other 's fingers in the presence of a nurse and chaplain , and then the newlywed wife watched the newlywed husband die . He 'd been in the ward since August , and he 'd died the day after Christmas , and through those two seasons of disease he 'd screamed one sentence only : I do n't want to die in a hospital . <p> I did n't have cancer , but the man I am engaged to marry did . When Jeff was first diagnosed with leukemia , doctors told us we would be hospital-bound for a year and that Jeff 's chances of survival were about fifty-fifty . When Jeff 's cancer relapsed before that year was over , doctors told us that Jeff would need a bit more than another year , possibly two , of treatment and that his chances for survival had dropped ten times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics , a doctor would sigh , or shake his head , gestures , I assumed , of sorrow , or at least sympathy . Always I would be on the hospital bed , stretched out alongside Jeff , who was often coherent but attached to so many IVs and electrical cords  --  hooked to chemotherapy , to morphine , to antibiotics , to saline , to heart monitors , and to this and that large black box blinking red and white lights  --  that he never could move much . Clear plastic cords carrying fluid into him and out of him would pass over my body , resting on my hip or arm , and I 'd watch them as doctors spoke , examining them for air bubbles  --  cause for alarm . <p> " The chances are slim , " doctors would say , " but you 're young . " <p> And then they would go , and I 'd rest my head on Jeff 's chest  --  carefully , so as not to disturb a wire or plastic tubing  --  and I would listen to and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blood . <p> Seasons now have passed , and dear luck , dear God , dear medicine , dear two and a half years of treatments and sufferings , I dedicate this story to you . In the past , I cursed you , I doubted you , I even , at times , begged death to release me from you-but now , I pronounce a thousand blessings to you for January 7 , 2000 , when Jeffrey Scott Hale survived his second bone marrow transplant at New England Medical Center . Jeff 's medical records are still stored there , in a file labeled " Patient #1 , " for he is the first to survive a variety of experimental procedures even most doctors can not pronounce clearly . <p> From such a past , of course , we have horror and anger and bewilderment within us , at times overcoming us , but , too , our truth includes yesterday , when , eleven months away from our last overnight stay in the hospital , we hiked through blue sky and snow two thousand feet up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Piedmont , from the snowy slopes of the Green Mountains all the way to the Connecticut River . To the east , New Hampshire 's White Mountains shone white and bright , and Jeff and I stood in the wind gazing at them , red-faced , numb , but not yet willing to turn around , to go back down , and I thought of what now  --  come what may  --  is true : We are here We are here We are here We are here We are here We are here We are here <p> " It 's back  --  " He came towards me from the front porch , arms outstretched . He had a short-sleeved T-shirt on , and his arms were pale , frail , like lines of light stretching from his body to mine . I stood by the car , across the dirt road , in the driveway . He was shaking his head , which was also pale , and bare of hair . He was crying . " I 'm so , so sorry  --  " I did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . <p> Jeff crossed the street . His face , I could see now , was wet and red . He was shaking , shaking his head . <p> " Baby , what  --  ? " <p> Even at six p.m. the sun was still bright and warm . The whole world was green and gold with the lushness of an overripe summer . Vermont in August is always more generous than I can remember until the month arrives . I breathed in the season 's smell  --  or sucked it in , really  --  a mixture of mown hay , pine trees , brook mist , and mulch . <p> Jeff took hold of my bare shoulders . He could barely speak , his lips and chin were quivering so wildly . " Is someone hurt ? " I asked , as if a plane crash , car crash , explosion , or fire could save us from the news Jeff had to tell . <p> " Oh , Sarah  --  the leukemia  --  " <p> His fingertips trembled against my skin . Or was it me , trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " <p> Instead of falling backwards , back against the car , its engine still tick-ticking behind me , I stood perfectly still , as if by not moving , I could deny time , and what I had just heard would be re-absorbed into the universe as an unspoken statement , a never-to-be-spoken statement . A lie . A ridiculous thought . <p> " Sarah  --  " Jeff put his face against my neck and sobbed . His tears were hot . I could feel his teeth against my skin . " Oh , Sarah  --  " Jeff squeezed me so tightly , all my bones seemed to fold into one thin line between his arms . <p> Still , my eyes remained dry and open . Over Jeff 's head , which was pressed against my throat , I stared at the house that all summer we had called home , for we were renting a single room inside its two-hundred-year-old yellow frame , which drooped and sagged like an overripe sunflower . Birds nested in the eaves of its front porch , and I noticed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air into its shadows . <p> " Dr. Linn left a message on the phone . They saw it in the last blood test . I 'm supposed to go back tomorrow . " <p> I shook my head . Reality could not bend this way , it just could not , because if it did , it would be packed too tightly with tragedy , it would be too unbalanced between hard hits and grace , it would be devoid of design . It would have to explode , for no outline could contain it . <p> Jeff lifted his head and looked at me . I stared back at his red , ravaged face . All last year , we had lived in and out of a hospital , staying in a single room up to fifty days at a time , while Jeff suffered through ten-day-long chemotherapy infusions , over one hundred fifty blood transfusions , a bone marrow transplant , dozens of fevers and infections and weeks upon weeks of vomiting and boils that swelled red , then burst with the very poisons doctors pumped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go to the upper meadow , " I said . " Mistakes happen in hospitals all the time . Let 's go to the meadow and pray for a mistake . " <p> Jeff lifted a hand from my shoulder to wipe his eyes . The meadow was where we wanted to marry , once Jeff 's health returned . A quarter of a mile off the road behind our landlady 's farmhouse , it was a concave scoop of land , at least twenty acres , south-facing , green and moist with seasonal springs . We called it our bowl of sun . Temperatures in the meadow were always ten degrees higher than anywhere else on our land . " I have n't seen our meadow for so long , " Jeff said , his hand still at his eyes . <p> Only two years had passed since we first discovered the land in Vermont we now owned . Walking into the upper meadow that first time , neither of us had said a word . We spent the entire day there , rarely letting go of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crows flap and hawks float ; we hiked a couple miles into the surrounding woods swatting mosquitoes and stopping still each time a deer passed , a fox , a grouse . The land was a kingdom of hip-high ferns , blooming meadow sweet , maple trees , pine trees , birch , ash , spruce , so much greenery , all of it full to bursting with life , of such endless variety , and we yearned to be part of its design . <p> Six months passed before we were able to find financing  --  the land had been for sale since the early eighties  --  and then on January 28 , 1998 , we purchased titles to the meadow , plus one hundred more acres of forest surrounding it . We lived at first in a tent , then in a salvaged aluminum trailer , waiting for Vermont 's harsh winter to pass so we could begin to build a more substantial wooden home . As soon as the snow melted and mud dried , we began to clear land and dig a foundation , and we hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . <p> Jeff was first diagnosed with leukemia that September , just after he finished decking over the first floor of our cabin . <p> " Do you think you could walk all the way to the meadow ? " I asked . This summer , in contrast to last year 's , Jeff had been so weak after his bone marrow transplant that walking more than one hundred steps exhausted him . Climbing stairs made him gasp . We had thought the chemo used for the transplant was causing his fatigue . <p> " I have to , " Jeff answered . <p> " I 'll change quickly . " I was still dressed for work in high heels and an ankle-length skirt , but when I tried to pull away from Jeff to cross the road , he held on to my shoulders . With one hand , he touched my face , smoothed a palm along my hair , which had grown long and blond over the summer . " You look beautiful , " he said . <p> That was when I started to cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , so full of energy , so healthy : why the downward tug back into the underworld ? I pulled Jeff 's hands down , off me , squeezing his wrists till I could feel blood passing through his veins and the thump of my own pulse in the tips of my thumbs and fingers . Leukemia , cancer of the blood , kills more than twenty thousand people a year . Was Jeff , really , one of this year 's fatalities ? <p> " Before the sun sets , " Jeff said . " Come on . " <p> We crossed the road together , towards the farmhouse , with Jeff 's left arm wrapped around my shoulders and my right arm holding on to his waist . My vision filled with a view of us from behind , as if I were still standing next to the car . We looked so old , like grandparents who 'd suffered hard lives , ungrateful children , negligent grandchildren , old people getting older whom the world had never treated kindly and was now completely defeating . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three porch steps without help . We leaned upon each other , our knees rising slowly . <p> We climbed through the spruce forest to the upper meadow , never letting go of each other 's hands . Every fifty yards or so , Jeff would stop , and we would wait until he could catch his breath . He was white as a moon , and his muscles trembled like leaves in a breeze . All summer , Jeff 's blood counts had been less than one fifth to one tenth of what a normal man needs in order to breathe adequately , absorb enough food , and move his limbs . We 'd thought time could heal him , though , time and love . <p> When we reached the upper meadow , the sun had already disappeared behind Braintree 's western ridge of blue mountains . Their jagged outlines glowed gold , and above that arched a band of red . The remaining stretch of sky was a light blue festooned with orange and pink ribbons of temporal light , which multiplied every passing minute , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jeff and I stood in the meadow for a while , looking at the sky and not each other . Because the sunset splendor was in the west , we did not notice the moon  --  which in late summer rose in the southeast  --  until it was high in the sky . The moon swelled with brightness as the sky slowly darkened , as if the moon was sucking up all the day 's light for its own nighttime glory . <p> Jeff sat down , then pulled me alongside him . He touched my eyes , my lips , my throat . In the brightness of the moon , I could see him clearly . He looked like something cut from stone . I leaned forward and placed my mouth against the side of his face : he was cold like stone , too . " Jeff , " I breathed in his ear , but who would hear me , who would hear , if death swallowed away my witness ? <p> Jeff began crying again , coughing out huge sobs , and I kissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his still-bald head , and then , suddenly , using both his hands , Jeff pulled my face in front of his own and placed his mouth on mine  --  hungrily , opening and closing his jaws , breathing in my breath , letting his own brief gasps escape into me . Instinctively , my hands moved to the back of Jeff 's hairless head , and the sensation of our skin , our flesh finding its way into the old union of touching and being touched , after so long , made me shake and feel afraid . For five months we had not kissed or made love . Doctors had warned us about infections , bruising , internal bleeding  --  and I put my hand between us on Jeff 's breastbone . A crazy pounding carried on beneath it , and again , I started to cry , this time for Jeff and for the life inside him that did not want to end . <p> " Do n't  --  " Jeff pulled off my shirt , put his face against my bare chest . " Do n't cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon high enough to seem small . I could feel my hair falling along my bare back , then the prickle of fledgling brambles under my bare legs . Jeff kneeled over me , smoothing his hands up and down my legs , up and down my waist and chest , up my neck and face , the tips of his fingers brushing me lightly , almost tickling me . The wind picked up and blew clouds in front of the moon , and with a strength I had n't felt in Jeff since he first got sick , he lifted me up , set me down on my back , and moved over me , my hips in his hands , his lips on my throat . " Do n't you go from me , " I tried to say , but all my words were one long sound , then another . <p> Slowly Jeff moved into my body , deeply , so deeply , until I felt as if Jeff were inside every part of me , even my toes and my fingers , leaving no room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff , with the pleasure of him , and the ground underneath my back began to spin wildly , as if I were suddenly conscious of the earth 's true speeds as it rotated on its axis . I imagined the moon from behind the clouds seeing Jeff and me , two tiny bodies making love on the gargantuan back of a spinning planet , and I wrapped my legs around Jeff 's back , my arms around his neck , because there was no way , absolutely no way I was letting this man fly off the ground into the black space that surrounded us . <p> Too soon , the clouds were gone again , and in the moon 's light , Jeff and I lay in a heap of limbs , like so many strands of golden , entwined straw . Jeff 's bare head lay under my left hand ; the fingers of my right interlaced with the fingers of his ; our legs stretched out alongside each other , touching from hip to knee to ankle . Our sweat had cooled and dried around us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How could they be , these hot , mobile skin-pots of life ? The light , the sounds of night , the wind , our exhausted and just about unified bodies  --  were n't these all eternal fixtures of earth 's design ? Who , or what , would dare bring death into this scene ? <p> Eventually , Jeff and I pulled on our clothes and , shivering , stumbled down the hill , through the spruce forest and into the room we rented in the big yellow farmhouse . We showered in scalding hot water , soaping each other 's faces , arms and backs , and then , bare-skinned and steaming , we slid under a heap of blankets on our bed and folded into each other like a fan . <p> " How do you feel ? " I whispered against Jeff 's lips . <p> " Better , " Jeff answered , squeezing me , and we both spun wildly into sleep . <p> Vermont : the two syllables had been a mantra for us for what felt like half our lives , but really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there or had ever lived there before we met each other . We 'd grown up in cities on opposite coasts , then met at twenty-six and twenty-seven in Somerville , Massachusetts , a sidekick of a neighborhood across the river from Boston , often called " Slummerville , " a place where tall , thin houses leaned and sagged like old , gray trees in an abandoned orchard , where the people were equally old , gray , and sagging , but , too , where a younger , transient , slightly grungy population was beginning to spring up like dandelions and yarrow . Self-employed artists , political progressives , writers , health-food advocates , poorly paid social workers , graduate students working for their second and third Ph.D . ' s , substitute teachers  --  an assortment of colors and flavors were sauntering into the gray town 's landlord-owned triple-deckers , renting out rooms for $150 to $250 a month , wearing ripped jeans and old leather jackets , talking art , talking hate , talking the system and what is the right way to live . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop in Somerville called The Someday . It was right next to a community theater and movie house built in the 1920 's , a place that used to sport vaudeville with a secret speakeasy underneath it . Now it hosted blues bands , folk rock guitarists , and classic stars like Taj Mahal , Merle Sanders , and Patty Larkin . The Someday first attracted theater customers and performers , and then all the growing younger crowd of Somerville . From seven a.m. to midnight , people talked over tall lattes and hot chocolate and starchy sweets , or they sat alone at tables sketching faces and poems into journals , or they stared through window glass to the silent rows of gray buildings outside , which leaned to the left , then to the right , depending on which way the wind blew . <p> For the transients of Somerville , Jeff 's cafe was essential : it provided them with a sense of having community and even security , when they had not yet established these things for themselves . The Someday was actually more of a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family was always gathered , the coffee always hot , the air warm , the lights on , the music playing , and where there was always room for one more person on the couch . When people 's heat got turned off because of an unpaid oil bill , they came to The Someday ; when they broke up with their girl- or boyfriend , they came to The Someday ; when they had a paper , proposal , or article to hand in and did not know how to begin , they came to The Someday . Jeff 's cafe was the place where food and drink and single pretty people were in abundance , where ideas flew between lips and suddenly felt more real than previously private , unsaid yearnings , where people were able to say inside their heads , " I am not alone , " and feel the truth of the words fill their bodies with each swallow of the hot coffee Jeff served them . <p> I did n't go to Jeff 's cafe until two years after Jeff opened it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . A ridiculous statement , of course : I knew even as I felt it that I was crazy . Jeff was standing behind the bar , chatting with people as he made them their drinks , and I stood staring at him as if he had wings . He wore tan canvas shorts over black long underwear , hiking boots , a baseball cap , and purple T-shirt that said " One Less Car " inside the spokes of a bicycle wheel . His shoulders were broad , his smile as wide as the room . His laugh was loud and long-like a drum solo in a rock song . <p> I could n't move , just watch and listen . Bob Marley sang about rivers and tears through two speakers over Jeff 's head . A young mother held her two-year-old child 's hands as it danced to the tunes on a couch . Jeff came from around the bar to hand her a glass mug full of coffee , and she smiled at him , and her child jumped up and down on the couch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next ? " Jeff called out across the room , and , still in the doorway , I felt so strange , that after another thirty or sixty seconds , I turned around and ran back out to the street . " You are crazy , " I said to myself , jogging to the subway , my backpack swinging , " absolutely crazy . " <p> I was working long hours then , often leaving my apartment before five a.m. and not returning until after nine at night . I felt as short on time as I did on money , and despite my feelings , it was many months before I walked to Jeff 's cafe again . <p> He was there , of course , making drinks and serving them to customers , and , yet again , I stood as if stuck in the doorway of his cafe , feeling so strange , I thought I was going to have to leave just like last time  --  but , " Excuse me , " someone said behind me , wanting in , and so I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , and , " Tea , " I answered to Jeff 's abrupt and unsettling question about what did I want , and then , " Whatever you recommend , " when he asked what kind of tea did I want . I was so nervous I was sweating , but Jeff continued to talk to me  --  he mentioned green tea and black tea , sweet-flavored tea and smoky-flavored tea  --  and the whole time I was too shy to look at his face . I stared instead at his hands , which pressed down on the black Formica counter . <p> His hands were huge . Both of my hands could fit inside one of his . His knuckles were as big as the outside halves of walnut shells , richly patterned with wrinkles . His fingers were long and strong , as if he played guitar or basketball regularly . His nails were thick and broken off , and I imagined his work wore them down the way wild horses ' hooves got trimmed when they galloped over rocks . <p> " Well ? " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , and the lenses of his round-rimmed glasses deepened to a dark purple . I could n't see his eyes . " Surprise me , " I said , shrugging , for I had n't heard a specific word he 'd said about tea . <p> Once I received my drink , I nearly ran into the back corner of the cafe , sat down , and watched this man who made me behave in such silly ways . My fingers were actually trembling around my teacup . " Crazy , " I repeated to myself . " Twenty-six years old and crazy , you do n't have time for cafes , you do n't have time to date , he would never ask you out anyway , he 's probably married , or celibate . . . " <p> Certainly , there is such a thing as falling in love at first sight , for the cliche would not exist otherwise , but why , for me , such insistent and instant adoration ? Jeff was definitely handsome  --  particularly that jaw of his that was sharper than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp and defined , and those bare forearms , thick and muscled , with veins big as blue ropes twining around them  --  but lots of men were handsome , and I did my best to avoid them . I wanted to be single for a while ; I had things I wanted to figure out about the world on my own . <p> And yet , there I was , sipping tea , staring at a man for an entire hour without blinking , wondering if he slept in T-shirts and boxers or in nothing , wondering if he would go camping with me in the mountains if I asked him , wondering what he did , exactly , when he was not at the cafe , and could I do it with him . <p> What attracted me , I began to figure out , over time , as my visits to Jeff 's cafe increased ( despite my insistence that I had no time for tea and cafes ) , was Jeff 's welcoming energy , his fortitude , a feeling that Jeff would last forever . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then stood behind them while other people enjoyed them  --  and in contrast , I felt insubstantial . I was a writer and teacher of stories , an occupation which too often felt fleeting , the mere studying and arranging of words on paper , some of which disappeared within a single year into the " no longer published " category . I watched Jeff as if he could teach me about what lasted , about what really mattered : how young I was , not to know flesh , strength , and even entire buildings might dissolve , in a mere moment ! <p> When Jeff and I finally started talking in 1996 , " Slummerville " had begun transforming from a campy rental neighborhood to an up-and-coming urban center . The gray triple-deckers were being painted pastel colors , refloored , given new foundations and kitchen cabinets , and sold as condos for up to half a million dollars apiece . More restaurants and coffee shops opened up ; dozens , then hundreds of more young people appeared , and these people wore high heels and blazers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downtown . At first I was interested , then alarmed by the change  --  and when my monthly rent doubled with one month 's notice , I decided it was time to get out . The hustle of the city had overtaken the slow , easy rhythm of what used to be a " ville , " and I did not want to hustle . Not anymore . <p> As I began to wonder seriously about where I might move , Jeff and I began talking . I was at his cafe every morning by then , and every morning I asked , as he poured me my tea , " How are you ? " Jeff always nodded at the question , then asked the person behind me for his or her order . Jeff 's homey cafe had grown into a business , and he did n't have time to chat with his customers the way he used to . <p> One morning , though , no one was in line behind me . It was Monday , seven a.m. , and raining . When I approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both elbows , his head in one of the palms of his large hands . <p> " Good morning , " I said . <p> Jeff frowned . <p> " How are you ? " <p> Jeff shook his head at my question . " Not so good . " He hardly moved his lips , so that it was hard , at first , to understand his words . <p> " Why not so good ? " I was so surprised , I forgot to be shy . " Your business is booming , you 're so successful . " <p> Jeff straightened up and began to fix me my usual cup of tea . " Lapsang Souchong , right ? " <p> I did n't know what to say other than " Everyone loves this place . " <p> Jeff handed me my tea . " But I ca n't just work for other people all my life . " <p> " Well  --  " I smiled . " Do n't we all work for other people ? I mean , is n't that the nature of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I were five years old . " That is a very narrow version of life , Sarah . " <p> My jaw dropped practically onto my toes . I swear , my mouth was so wide , Jeff could have fit his entire head inside it . He knew my name ! How ? He must have been listening when I came to the cafe with friends . I felt as if I were on a bridge made of rope hanging over a bottomless ravine . <p> " Do you want to work for other people all your life ? " Jeff continued , then bent down , lifted a cardboard box onto the counter , and began unloading scones into a glass display case . <p> " But  --  I do n't really think anyone can work just for herself . You always have to answer to somebody  --  do n't you ? " <p> Jeff did n't stop working . " I like to believe there 's more to work for than people . " <p> I waited quietly . But Jeff seemed finished with talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down on the floor . " Would you really leave your cafe ? " <p> Jeff straightened up , wiped his hands on the front of his T-shirt , then placed one on the counter and leaned on it . His eyes were green , I noticed , with bits of gold and brown in them . " There 's other things I want to do . " <p> I placed my hands on the counter alongside his . I wanted to say , Can I come ? , but instead asked , " Like what ? " <p> We spoke for five hours that day , and for five hours every day that week . Conversation flowed like river water . I called work to say I was sick and would not be able to come in for an indefinite while , and Jeff told me he wanted land , he wanted to produce food rather than serve it , he missed sky and trees and free time . I told him about the two CSA farms I had begun working on during the weekends , about how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told me what herbs he wanted to grow to make medicinal teas for his cafe . We discussed the warmth of North Carolina , the expanses of Montana , good land deals in Eastern Washington State . I told him I 'd lived in India , Israel , about my commitments as a teacher and as a writer . Jeff explained to me about yurts , geodesic domes , timber-framed cabins  --  ways of building houses for less than fifteen thousand dollars . He lent me The Book of Tea ; I gave him The Gift by Lewis Hyde . <p> Five days of talking , and then it was Saturday . The cafe on weekends was always as crowded as a dance club , and when I arrived , Jeff was racing around . He looked vexed . The back of his T-shirt was wet with sweat . He noticed me right away , though , standing in the doorway . " Are you ready for the mountains ? " he called out to me over people 's heads . <p> I smiled like a bride . Was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would hop in it with him , forever ? <p> Someone called his name , and he turned around and began refilling coffee containers behind the bar . I backed out of the cafe  --  it was too crowded , and Jeff was too busy to talk to me  --  but oh , outside on the sidewalk , I felt like a shook-up can of soda about to bust . I was thrumming with such a buzz of energy  --  light and air were zinging their way along all my dark and locked-up insides . That evening , I could n't help it , I returned to the cafe and left for Jeff an envelope containing seven cow beans . <p> Cow beans are beautiful beans  --  a deep maroon red with bright white spots speckled over them , colorful and remarkable enough to seem special , even magical , like Jack-and-the-beanstalk beans . With them I enclosed a note : " Yes , I 'm ready for the mountains . " <p> The next morning , Sunday , Jeff was waiting for me . " Beans , you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ! " He came around from behind the bar and , for the first time , touched me , placing his large hands on my shoulders . I looked down at our four feet . " When are we going ? " Jeff said to the hair on my head . <p> I licked my lips , then looked up . " Now ? " <p> Two months later , after a month more of talking , then another month of kissing and lovemaking , Jeff and I were on the road in my car scouting out land deals in nearby rural areas . Over the next sixteen months , we explored lots and old farms in West Virginia , North Carolina , Maryland , Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Washington , Idaho , Montana , and Wyoming . We wanted cheap land with water , a place where we could create expansive gardens of exotic edibles , and , too , I was finding that I wanted time and quiet so I could write down the stories that had always spun through me but which I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally , one day in mid-August , 1997 , we were driving in Vermont , after cruising through Maine and New Hampshire just the day before , bumping along Thayer Brook Road looking for the old Albright farm . I was making a sandwich out of cheese and bread on my lap , and Jeff was holding a map in his left hand , steering with his right . <p> " We 're looking for two trailers on our left , one silver , one blue , " Jeff said . <p> I looked up , holding my sandwich with both hands . " Some nice houses along this road , " I said , seeing a white sprawling Victorian and barn , then a little while later a yellow one of similar design and age . <p> " Not too close together , too-about a quarter of a mile between . " <p> " You do n't want it farther than that , in case you have an emergency . " <p> " I want to be able to walk naked from bedroom to garden without anyone seeing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Jeff smiled , then  --  " Hey , there they are . " He swung the car up onto a muddy mound of driveway and cut the engine . " Where 's the plot lines ? " <p> Still holding on to my sandwich , I looked around the floor of the car . " Somewhere , " I said . " I 'm so hungry . Ca n't we just get out and eat ? " <p> Jeff let a bit of a sigh sneak out of him , but agreed . I put my sandwich back in the bag of food we 'd brought along , told Jeff to grab the gallon jug of water , and we hiked up to the trailers . <p> It took me only about a third of a second to wake up from my malaise . Behind the two dilapidated trailers , the land was spectacular , no less stunning than Emerald City would be if it were countryside rather than kingdom . The grass was hip-high , a sweet green that became gold each time the wind changed direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft breeze , like the grass that brushed along our bare thighs . Thirty acres of meadow stretched up and over a hill , only a few sapling birches shaking leaves and whispering in its expanse . On the right side of the hill , forty acres of dense spruce forest stood quiet and dark , a place that springs , deer , fox , and even moose , we 'd soon learn , trailed through , depending on the season . There were no sounds-not a car , not a saw , not even a bird . The day was Sunday , the time was noon , the temperature over ninety degrees , and it felt as if the whole world were sleeping in the shade , except for us , standing here , sunned , dazzled , and , finally , home . <p> The owners of the property allowed us to camp out on the land every weekend until we were ready and able to hand them the required check . By the end of January 1998 , the land was officially ours , and by March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarves , and hats , my car far behind us full of cleaning supplies , construction tools , coolers of food , and  --  a surprise from Jeff  --  three dozen roses . <p> The initial plan was this : fix up one of the two trailers to live in , tear down the other , build a timber-frame cabin before next winter 's snow started to fall . <p> Both trailers were built in 1948 and looked it . We focused on salvaging the smaller one , spending days pulling trash out of it and scrubbing it down with orange-scented disinfectant . That March , the days ' temperatures ranged from ten to twenty degrees . Whatever water we used  --  which came from gallon jugs we filled up at a hole in the brook  --  froze within half a minute . So we scraped and scrubbed off the ice as well as the dirt and used up probably a thousand paper towels . We filled two dumpsters with trash . After working , I 'd be wet with sweat , then so cold , I 'd shake as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff made bonfires of trash to warm me , and we put rocks in the coals , which later we 'd pull out and huddle over with blankets over our heads to catch in the heat . <p> " I love this , " Jeff said the first night we did the hot rock experiment . The air was so full of snow , I inhaled at least three tablespoons of ice with every breath . <p> " You 're a nut . " I was still cold , despite the smoke and flames . <p> Progress continued , though . The air warmed and the ground began to thaw . In the shelter of the spruce forest , we dug a hole four feet deep ( that task took us two days ) and lay two pieces of lumber across it for an open-air outhouse . Our shower was an old apple tree from which we hung a five-gallon black plastic container full of river water , with a pine-board pallet as a floor . We also salvaged a tin tub , which we balanced on cement cinder-blocks . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land to fill it , then build a fire underneath it and soak . <p> As we grew more resourceful , our trailer became more of a home . Jeff tacked purple carpeting on its floors and installed an ice-fishing stove in the kitchen . That tiny stove could raise the temperature from zero degrees to sixty in less than half an hour . We also paid a propane company to hook up a salvaged gas stove inside the trailer , and even though only two of its four burners worked , it allowed us to stay inside while heating up water for tea and cans of chili for dinner  --  as opposed to us huddling over an open fire outside at night , even if it were snowing or raining . Progress , progress . <p> It was late April by the time we decided to tear down the second trailer . It was a monstrosity , stretching over fifty feet long , reeking of spilled beer , leaking oil , and nasty old men . Bullet holes scarred its entire outside . Everything inside of value , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghost of a landfill risen to wreak havoc upon all of wasteful mankind . <p> " This is going to take all summer , " I groaned to Jeff . The day was beautiful , full of blue air and tiny specks of gold . The snow was gone . Insects burst from the sodden ground ; so did green weeds . The air filled up with a million smells  --  of wet earth , rotting vegetation , and of something being born . <p> " And our options are . . . ? " <p> " I 'm sure there 's , you know , professionals who could just . . . " <p> " Say abracadabra ? " <p> " For a few dollars , maybe . " <p> Jeff lifted his crowbar up between our faces : " Herein lies our magic  --  and the protector of our dollar bills  --  which you 'd rather spend . " Jeff moved closer to the trailer . " If you hear anything louder than crashing and banging , make sure I 'm not dead . " <p> With that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer down . First , he wrenched off the aluminum siding with the crowbar , which we saved in pieces for the dump . That took two weeks . Then Jeff began smashing down the walls with the axe . He could only work four or five hours a day , the work was so brutal . My job , while he rested , was to drag all trash to the dumpsters and also to roll up and bag the exposed insulation . <p> Fiberglass insulation is nasty stuff , especially after it 's sat inside a wall for fifty years . Despite the growing warmth , I had to wear two layers of clothes , for the glass filaments moved like fleas through clothing and skin to itch a body to death . I wore a wool knit hat over my hair and tied an old shirt around my mouth . A neighbor had warned me that breathing in the old fiberglass dust could ruin my lungs forever . <p> In a strange way , I enjoyed those hours . It felt good to accomplish something . I was anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really , really did not want to be living in the other trailer for another winter . <p> I also enjoyed the work because it was surprisingly interesting : an entire ecosystem was thriving inside that insulation . I found mouse turds in there , gray paper bits of wasp nests , and bunches of dried leaves that must have been some creature 's nest . When I found a two-foot long snakeskin , I called out to Jeff : " Hey , come look what I found . Maybe there 's more ! This stuff is supposed to be good luck ! " <p> Jeff came up just as I was reaching above my head to pull down a thick fold of insulation . Instantly , something huge and heavy came whirling down towards me  --  black and hissing . I screamed , leapt back against Jeff , and kept on screaming and screaming . Jeff pulled me back farther . <p> In front of us , a black snake mottled with brown splotches coiled up and hissed , its mouth opened wide . It had teeth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of stunned staring , Jeff let go of my shoulders ( I whimpered ) and threw a stick . In an instant , the snake was gone , tall grass rippling ever so slightly , marking its path . <p> For a full minute , neither of us said a word . <p> " I 'm going to get my boots , " Jeff said . <p> " I do n't feel like doing this anymore today , " I said , and followed Jeff into the other trailer . <p> Like almost every American , I believe in will . I believe in humans ' undying ability to act negatively or positively upon their own lives and upon others ' lives , too . But the return of Jeff 's disease had pushed him and me into all that lies beyond will and self-directed action . There really are times when the circumstances around people-and in Jeff 's case , within them  --  can not be affected by human intention . Hurricanes , wars , falling in love , disease  --  there is so much that sweeps people into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control individually . <p> But how does a person stay human inside such events ? For to be human  --  Americans are told  --  is to affect things , to act upon them with their own ideas . If all people can do is experience what life lays down upon them-or throws down upon them  --  then what are they ? Animals ? Slaves ? Fodder to fate ? <p> Jeff and I tried so hard to avert a story of death . Not only did Jeff agree to the most harsh and intense Western medicine methods of fighting cancer , he also tried every alternative method as well . Throughout the first year and a half of his disease , he met with an Eastern acupuncturist , a Western herbalist and nutritionist , a hands-on healer , different massage therapists , and he prayed . Every day he prayed for God to show him what He wanted , and Jeff vowed to follow any set of orders . All he wanted was more time to walk on Earth . Jeff was willing to give up everything but time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time we both put into Jeff 's healing , his cancer came back anyway . And again , Jeff chose to fight it . There we were , back inside the hospital , for another year . His odds of surviving the second transplant were about as good as those of New England suffering an earthquake within the next ten years . <p> We knew we were n't exceptional . Over the last year in the cancer ward , we 'd met many , many people  --  parents and grandparents and people younger than us  --  who were trying to live despite their disease , and the disease would not let them . Absolutely unaffected by the faith , hope , and goodwill those people demonstrated , their cancer returned , and they died . Such inexplicable punishment terrified me , bewildered me , and at times , I did not feel sane . If Jeff died , I began to believe that I also would have to die . I had been engaged to Jeff for two years , and for one and a half of those two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred eight-hour days in his hospital and spent over fifty nights in a cot beside his bed . My skin had become as pale as the hospital walls ; purple half-moons opened up underneath my eyes and stayed there . When Jeff was not living at the hospital , we still had to go there for day-long clinic visits two to three times a week , and often we had to monitor IV infusions of antibiotics or chemo throughout the night . I had quit three teaching jobs on three separate occasions in order to care for Jeff and had supplemented our shrinking income by stocking groceries in an all-night supermarket . Between hospital stays , I had moved us seven times , saving rent by housesitting and staying with friends while our half-built cabin in Vermont wasted away under blue tarps for two winters in a row . <p> I tried to take breaks by walking outside the hospital , hoping to relieve myself from the pain I witnessed and seemed , even , to absorb from Jeff , but the air of the city stunk worse than burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , and the noises of trucks , buses , and bulldozers were a constant grinding in my ears . My walks usually ended with me leaning against a brick building , or sitting on a guardrail of a parking lot , putting a hand over my eyes , and crying , as one hundred people per minute passed me by . I cried for Jeff , horrified by such ghastly destruction of a body that had seemed to me more divine than human , and I mourned the loss of our life in Vermont , our abandoned home , the woods we walked , the job I loved , the few spaces and positions we had been creating and arranging into a shared life . <p> And more than anything , I cried because I wanted our love back . I was starved for our love , for the physical and reciprocal cycles and sensations of it , and yet I did not believe , could not believe that chemotherapy and radiation were anything other than agents of war and horror , and why did they get to have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheeled Jeff into the hospital basement for twenty minutes of total body irradiation ( TBI ) . He was thin as an eleven-year-old boy by then and so easily folded into the 4 ' x 4 ' box the two nurses led him to . The box was tilted on its side , and so sitting in it , Jeff 's knees pressed against his chin . The nurses strapped plastic bags filled with rice on whatever parts of his body touched other parts of his body  --  in the hollows of his knees , between his stomach and his thighs , inside his elbows . " Want boiled rice for lunch ? " one of the nurses joked . <p> Then they leveled the radiation machine at him . It looked big as the nose of an airplane . They tested it : a thin blue line beamed straight at Jeff . I felt I was watching a video game in an arcade : Can you hit the tied-up cancer patient in the 4 ' x 4 ' box ? <p> Then we left . We closed a door that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miniature black-and-white TV screen . <p> " Are you afraid of getting cancer , working down here ? " I asked , turning away from the screen . I felt green and was struggling not to vomit . <p> Both nurses shook their heads . One pulled up her sweater and showed me a radiation meter attached to her belt . " I 'm four months ' pregnant , " she said . " I would n't be here if I did n't feel totally safe . This thing never gets beyond normal levels . " <p> " I 'd be more scared of chemo than this stuff , " the other nurse said . " This stuff is way less harsh than those bags . " <p> Who could say which was worse ? Radiation and chemo tore their way through Jeff , sores opened up all over his body , inside his mouth , and even along the inside of his throat and intestines . Migraines made him scream , fevers made him sweat so that I had to change the bed sheets every other hour . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to be fed and hydrated through IV tubing . His liver and kidneys began to fail , and his eyes , his palms , then all his body developed a sickly yellow color . He also began to react against antibiotics ( he was on three ) : his hands and feet became swollen and broke out in a bright red rash that burned like an infection from poison ivy . <p> Meanwhile , I cried in a chair beside him , wearing a hospital mask and rubber gloves . Occasionally I rubbed his head with a gloved hand , but then he would whisper , " Enough , " and could say no more because of the sores in his mouth . <p> Before reentering the hospital for his second transplant , Jeff and I had discussed forgoing more treatment . In August , after his leukemia was rediagnosed , we spent one , then two full days in Vermont . Our last afternoon , we spent resting on a beach of small stones by the river that cut through the northwest corner of our land . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still running hard , even though we 'd been still for fifteen minutes . <p> Jeff picked up one of my hands and brought it to his lips . I watched his lips pucker ; I listened to the river run over stones . <p> " Jeff , why are you still ill ? " <p> Jeff did n't answer . When we 'd first moved to the land in 1998 , he 'd moved rocks half the size of me into a wall , planning out the gardens , patios , and paths of our first home . He 'd hand-tilled a quarter of an acre for our first garden  --  a circle garden  --  with a spiral path winding around inside it . He 'd ridden his bike up three different mountains . Now , he could n't even push his bike across the driveway . <p> " I had a lot of bad stuff pumped into me at the hospital , Sarah , " he finally said , " and so has the earth . There 's just a lot of poison out there . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital ? " <p> Jeff picked up strands of my hair and let them fall . " Of course . " He was n't crying ; he just sounded exhausted , so exhausted , like he had n't slept in a hundred years , like he was a spirit and not a man and had witnessed just too damn much of mankind 's folly . " Two days , " Jeff said . " I would n't last two days , if I were to lie here and not go back . I 'd suffocate from lack of blood . The leukemia 's growing . I can feel it . " <p> " I do n't know of what I 'm more scared-the hospital , or- " I stopped . My hand found one of Jeff 's hands and squeezed . " I ca n't imagine it . " <p> Jeff was quiet again . Then , finally , " I ca n't , either . I 've asked , ' Am I supposed to die by this river ? ' but Sarah , I know the answer 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground beside him and poured them slowly into a small mound beside us . " I have to go back , to the hospital . I have to try again . " <p> Tears slid out of me silently , one after the other . I imagined them pooling around Jeff and me , then under us-and yet where could a river of them carry us , so we could be free of disease ? <p> " I just do n't feel ready to die yet , " Jeff continued , then lifted his head , kissed my hair . His arms held me to him tightly . Those arms ! Arms of a man who built things , then stood behind them as others enjoyed them , arms of a man who I thought would last forever <p> " You swear ? " My voice was shaking . " You swear you 're not going to ? " <p> " I swear . " Jeff rolled on his side so my head was on sand looking up at him . His eyes were gold , green , brown : oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human head to hold . " I swear , Sarah . Stay by me , and you 'll see . " <p> <p> By Sarah Silbert <p>
