<p> At first blush , it seemed like a neighborly thing to do : Washington Redskins owner Daniel M. Snyder buying a stake in Six Flags Inc. , which operates one of its amusement parks just up the road from Snyder 's own FedEx Field , and offering his business talent to help turn the ailing company around . <p> Six months and a number of angry letters later , however , Snyder 's efforts to remake Six Flags in his own image have been firmly rebuffed , and the usually tenacious businessman has announced he plans to wash his hands of water slides and roller coasters . <p> " In light of what we believe will be a disappointing future for the Company we have determined that continued investment in the Company is not in our best interest , " Snyder wrote to a Six Flags board member last month in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> Snyder has not yet disclosed whether he has sold any of the 8.15 million shares of Six Flags stock he acquired in August  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $34.2 million . But the quick end to Snyder 's interest in the amusement park industry surprised Wall Street analysts who expected him to persist in shaking up a company whose customer base , profits and stock price all have been falling . <p> " Goodbye Mr. Snyder , we hardly knew ya ! " began a Jan. 18 report on Six Flags by Prudential Equity Group LLC . <p> Six Flags ' top executives have stayed mum on the Snyder episode , declining to be interviewed . <p> " This is not an issue that we are discussing , " said Christopher Haenn , marketing director of Six Flags ' park in Largo , which yesterday announced a name change  --  from Six Flags America to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor . The 23-year-old park will reopen Memorial Day weekend with what it calls a " tropical Caribbean theme . " Originally known as Wild World , the park on Central Avenue has been rebranded three times since it was acquired in 1992 by Six Flags , then known as Premier Parks . <p> On Wall Street , analysts say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six Flags , which owns and operates 30 parks in North America . The Oklahoma City-based company reported losing $67.7 million in the first nine months of last year , compared with a profit of $4.2 million in the same period in 2003 . But Snyder 's advice should at least have been taken seriously , analysts said . <p> " Dan Snyder has proven himself to be a very wise marketing talent , " said Glenn Eckert , a senior vice president of Moody 's Investors Service , a bond rating agency that has given Six Flags a " negative " outlook . <p> The Redskins have n't had a winning season since 1999 , when Snyder bought the team for $800 million . Behind the scenes , though , he has been credited with building one of the most financially successful teams in sports  --  worth about $1 billion , according to an estimate by Forbes magazine . Snyder has boosted the capacity of FedEx Field in Landover , making it the largest stadium in the National Football League , with 91,655 seats . <p> Like the Redskins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks buying admission tickets , then , once inside the park , spending money on hot dogs and souvenirs . Unlike the Redskins , Six Flags has been losing customers  --  and money . <p> In a conference call with analysts in November , Six Flags chairman and chief executive Kieran E. Burke blamed the poor performance on bad weather and a general weakness in the U.S. economy that affected " lower and middle-income consumers who make up the majority of our customers . " He lamented that even a new advertising campaign , wrapped around a tuxedoed , elderly character with oversized glasses known as Mr. Six , had failed to turn things around . <p> Snyder , who holds his Six Flags shares in an entity called Red Zone LLC , is n't the company 's only high-profile  --  and agitated  --  investor . By the end of 2004 , Microsoft Corp . founder Bill Gates had accumulated 10.8 million shares through Cascade Investment LLC , according to an SEC filing . In August , Cascade had reported that it , too , was becoming " increasingly dissatisfied " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael Larson , did not respond to requests for an interview . <p> As recently as May 2002 , Six Flags ' stock sold for as much as $18 . Yesterday , it closed at $4.39 , up 5.8 percent , on the New York Stock Exchange . <p> Snyder began buying Six Flags shares Aug. 11 , and he continued accumulating them for the next two weeks at prices ranging from $3.55 to $4.73 a share . He quickly went on the offensive , announcing that he bought the stock because he thought it was undervalued , and serving notice that the company needed to make some swift and decisive changes to rebuild the business . <p> On Aug. 31 , one day after he had bought his last chunk of stock , Snyder wrote in an SEC filing that Six Flags ' managers had " failed to implement measures to increase revenues and decrease expenses . " He warned that he may encourage Six Flags to sell itself or merge with another company . <p> A day later , Snyder phoned Burke , Six Flags ' chairman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet without first speaking to his lawyers , " Snyder later reported . <p> On Sept. 2 , Snyder sent a letter to Six Flags ' non-management board members , requesting a meeting . " Current management apparently feels its time is better spent speaking with attorneys rather than exploring ways to improve shareholder value , " Snyder wrote in the letter , also filed with the SEC . <p> Three days later , Snyder headed to Wall Street , laying out his case for change in a meeting with Prudential analyst Katherine Styponias . <p> " Mr. Snyder believes that cross-marketing and/or sponsorship opportunities abound at Six Flags , and that the current management team has not taken full advantage of them , " Styponias wrote in a research note . She characterized Snyder as " typically a long-term investor " who " might be patient in trying to effect change . " <p> Snyder seemed anything but patient , though . <p> On Sept. 28 , he met with Six Flags ' non-management directors . " Mr. Snyder made some suggestions which , while appreciated , neither the non-management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were likely to enhance shareholder value , " Burke later told analysts . <p> Two weeks later , Snyder received a letter from the non-management directors , whom , he later wrote , accused him of not " understanding . . . the theme park business . " <p> At the time , Bear Stearns analyst Glen Reid called the " shareholder activism " of Snyder and Gates " one potential bright light for Six Flags , " adding : " It is clear that the company 's difficulties go beyond weather . " <p> In January , Snyder decided that he 'd had enough of Six Flags . <p> " We believe the board 's steadfast and blind loyalty to an under-performing management team will in the short term , at best , simply maintain the status quo and in the longer term result in a material loss of stockholder value , " Snyder wrote in a Jan. 14 letter to a Six Flags board member . The letter was filed with the SEC . <p> And he was finished , he added , as a Six Flags investor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if Snyder and his family had ever have visited the amusement park , just to the south of FedEx Field . <p> And he did n't seem to care . <p> " They 're our neighbors , " Haenn said , " but I really do n't know what Mr. Snyder was seeking or what he was espousing.
