<p> It was the day after in southwestern Brooklyn yesterday : work crews pushed brooms , steered street sweepers , shoveled bricks , lifted tree trunks and started the rebuilding in the aftermath of the unlikely tornado that swept through the area early Wednesday morning . <p> Men in hard hats loaded up a construction backhoe with aluminum siding and other debris outside damaged row houses on Bay Ridge Avenue . Around the corner at the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church , workers used plywood to cover a giant hole  --  the space where a 51-year-old stained-glass window with the image of Jesus Christ had been a beacon for the neighborhood . Blocks away , trees that littered a playground , a basketball court and a baseball field waited for the chain saw . <p> Residents of Sunset Park and Bay Ridge surveyed the streets around them yesterday with a mixture of concern and gratitude . <p> The concern stemmed from the fact that the storm , which produced a Category 2 tornado with winds from 111 to 135 miles an hour , caused damage expected to total millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude was twofold : Residents said they were thankful no one was seriously hurt and pleased that the city was working quickly to clean up the mess . <p> Standing outside her daughter 's home on 68th Street in Bay Ridge , Frances Bernacchi said she did not recognize the block from the debris-strewn wreck it had been on Wednesday . " You would never believe this is the same area , " she said . <p> Ms. Bernacchi 's daughter was one of the lucky ones on 68th Street : the roof of her two-story brick building received some damage from the storm  --  more than $5,000 worth , Ms. Bernacchi said  --  but it was safe to occupy . The residents of several other homes on the block of 68th between Third and Fourth Avenues were forced to move because of roof damage . About 30 buildings in the city remain temporarily off limits to residents , the majority in the Bay Ridge section , because of storm damage , a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings said . Inspectors have examined damaged properties around the city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were given yellow tags , allowing access only to undamaged portions of a home . <p> A total of roughly 60 properties reported some damage , officials said . Numerous cars were destroyed or damaged by falling debris and crashing trees . <p> The tornado had several flashpoints , first touching down on Staten Island shortly before 6:30 a.m. and then skipping across the water on its way to Bay Ridge . In the West Brighton section of Staten Island , cleanup was centered at Richmond University Medical Center , where 30 mature trees fell and a water line was damaged . A hospital spokesman said there were no disruptions to patients ' care . <p> At the edge of Leif Ericson Park in Bay Ridge , a tree that once stood more than two stories tall lay on its side , exposing a deep gash in the ground where its roots were yanked out . A few steps away , a white flagpole stood on solid ground . At the Bay Ridge Nissan dealership nearby , at 65th Street and Fifth Avenue , men climbed ladders to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealership appeared to have come through the storm unscathed . <p> Trees seemed to take the hardest hit . The city 's parks department reported that 292 trees in its jurisdiction came down , the majority in Brooklyn . In addition , more than 300 downed tree limbs were reported to 311 . " This has been one of the most damaging storms in the parks department 's history , " said Warner Johnston , the department 's spokesman . <p> Trees leaned on chain-link fences and swing sets at Leif Ericson Park . In the Prospect Park South neighborhood , roughly three miles from Bay Ridge , some were split down the middle and others were uprooted . Al Cleary , 53 , a real estate broker and the president of the neighborhood association , said at least a dozen large branches flew onto the roof of his Victorian home on Albemarle Road . <p> " I ran outside and the trees were shredded as if someone had ripped the tops off of them and thrown them over the house , " said Mr. Cleary , who estimated the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the houses are spread apart . The trees had somewhere to land . " <p> The pastor of the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church , where the front stained-glass window and three other smaller windows were blown out by the high winds , was calmly taking everything in stride . A sign on the gate outside informed passers-by that Sunday services would be held as usual at 11 a.m . <p> The stained-glass window , located at the back of the church 's upstairs sanctuary and overlooking the street outside , was about 25 feet tall and 12 feet across . The pastor , the Rev. David Aja-Sigmon , said repairs would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . <p> " Do I think God made this happen ? " Mr. Aja-Sigmon said . " No , I do n't think God would wish this on anyone . I do n't think God makes people suffer . More likely , if you 're looking for God in a catastrophe , you 're seeing it in all the people that have been great in trying to reach out and help us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unable to return to their homes because of storm damage slept overnight Wednesday in the gymnasium of the Luis Munoz Marin elementary school at 60th Street and Third Avenue .

Everyone  --  except her son 's girlfriend , who is in Florida , and the pets  --  relocated on Wednesday to two rooms at a Best Western hotel in Bay Ridge . The cat was with her son 's friend and her daughter was watching the dog . <p> The tornado peeled off the roof of their home , but no one was hurt . Mrs. Fedele had been recuperating at home after undergoing double bypass surgery .
