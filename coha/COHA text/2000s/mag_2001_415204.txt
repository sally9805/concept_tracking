The Ocean Club , located on Paradise Island , across the harbor from Nassau in the Bahamas , opened in the spring of 1962 . It was A &P; heir Huntington Hartford II 's first foray into the development of what is now Paradise Island ( originally called Hog Island ; Hartford wisely changed its name ) . The Ocean Club was then a private estate called Shangri-La . When Hartford bought the property in 1960 , his plan was to turn it into an exclusive resort . He bought it for $9.5 million and reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , even for a man of means . The Ocean Club 's early days were glamorous ones , with visits from the cream of society ( Zsa Zsa Gabor , columnist Cholly Knickerbocker , various European aristocrats ) . Eventually that crowd turned to other places , and the Ocean Club lost its luster . It still had its charms , but they were wearing thin from benign neglect.When South African megadeveloper Sol Kerzner of Sun International bought property on Paradise Island from Merv Griffin in 1994 , his heavy investment called for , among other things , a much-needed overhaul of the Ocean Club ( this time costing $100 million , ten times as much as Huntington Hartford 's ) , the first phase of which is now in place . Today the crowd is younger and hipper than the society of yore-Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber ( who were married there ) , Natasha Richardson-but it is still a quiet haven , unless you happen to be there during a wedding or a star-studded event . Kerzner 's other Paradise Island property is the gigantic Atlantis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ocean Club in every way . Atlantis is an extravaganza that would be just as at home in Las Vegas as on Paradise Island-maybe more . To Kerzner 's credit , he has insisted that the Ocean Club remain a small , exclusive , meticulously landscaped hideaway on a gorgeous beach . So , no casinos , no shopping arcade , no theme restaurants , no fish tanks or water slides , no gimmicks of any kind . If you want them , repair to Atlantis . The swimming pool at the Ocean Club is the same but with spruced-up surroundings and a light-lunch bar . Beyond the pool are the terraced gardens , once again well tended , and an actual Augustinian cloister from France , dating to the 12th century and imported by William Randolph Hearst . It is a wonderfully dramatic backdrop for the pool . The prettiest rooms and suites are in the new Crescent Wing . An existing structure , the Hartford Wing , is being upgraded ( all new bathrooms , for example ) , but the decor in the rooms needs de-chintzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its lush environment , instead of competing with it . That is apparently in the plans . So is a spa , due to open this fall-if it is on schedule . The main reception area is a vast improvement over the old one ( which will become the spa entrance ) and gracefully done , with a large , open library/sitting room where guests can congregate for tea or drinks , or just sit and relax . There are nine tennis courts and a spectacular , challenging Tom Weiskopf-designed 18-hole course that even nongolfers will enjoy walking . And , if visiting the Ocean Club is n't enough , you can buy property on its Ocean Club Estates . ( Michael Jordan has , so why should n't you ? ) Perhaps the most provocative change at the Ocean Club is the addition of Dune , a restaurant designed by France 's Christian Liaigre , known for his elegant restraint . The consulting chef is the highly acclaimed Jean-Georges Vongerichten . Dune is easily the most innovative restaurant in Nassau . On the plus side , the food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare found all too often at hotels in the Caribbean . Some of the combinations may seem a little odd ( an appetizer of watermelon and goat cheese , for example ) , but Vongerichten is an inventive chef whose creations are more likely to be tasty than peculiar , so his dishes usually work . One of the best things on the dinner menu is the Black Plate , an Asian-inspired collection of crab spring roll , lobster daikon , tuna in rice paper and quail with Thai spices , all with exotic accompanying sauces .

This may bother people who come to the Ocean Club yearning to have dinner on a terrace while they are caressed by warm ocean breezes . Those breezes are there , but better felt at the adjacent bar , where meals are served outdoors . If you opt for breakfast or lunch outside , you can strongly sense being in the islands , especially if you order the house punch , a potent concoction of dark rums , coconut liqueur and fruit juices . Limit yourself to one A great advantage of the Ocean Club is its proximity to the East Coast : a twoand-a-half-hour direct flight from New York ; less than an hour from Florida . The drive from the airport to the hotel takes forty minutes . To be this close to Paradise ( Island ) is a temptation that is indeed hard to resist . Luxury beachfront rooms in high season are $835 per night , but from May 29 through December 20 , they drop to $645 .
