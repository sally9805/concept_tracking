IN THE ' 70S , HE WAS AT THE CENTER OF A FAMOUS OBSCENITY CASE OVER HIS comedy routine " Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television . " At age 66 , George Carlin is still provoking audiences with his stand-up material , watching a new battle over broadcast indecency unfold and co-starring in a movie , Jersey Girl . He talked , seriously , with TIME 's Richard Zoglin . <P> YOU ARE FAMOUS FOR THE SEVEN-DIRTY-WORDS BROUHAHA . IT 'S BEEN 30 YEARS . DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT THOSE WORDS ARE STILL FORBIDDEN ? No . What has happened over the centuries is that a natural modesty that people have has been exploited by religion to be a kind of fear and shame and guilt about our bodies and the functions they have . Now it is probably a permanent feature of the psyche of people . <P> WITH THE NEW FCC CRACKDOWN ON INDECENCY , DO YOU THINK WE ARE ENTERING A MORE REPRESSIVE AGE ? There is no question that the repressive , Christian , right-wing , business , criminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think the Patriot Act has been exploited to put more severe controls on our behavior into place than they ever dreamed they would have a chance to implement . <P> DO YOU THINK IT IS HARDER OR EASIER TO SHOCK AN AUDIENCE TODAY ? I like to push people 's buttons . I like to bother people 's sacred values . It is not hard to do that with certain topics . I find the taboos of today are religion , the flag and children  --  the parent-child phenomenon . This cult of the child has developed , and the cult of the parent  --  which are to me appalling and overdone and probably dangerous for children . <P> EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE VERY POLITICALLY AWARE , YOUR MATERIAL IS NOT OVERTLY POLITICAL . YOU DO N'T DO JOKES ABOUT THE PRESIDENT . IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE ? No . I do n't like topical humor . It bothers me . I do n't enjoy it . I find it thin and superficial and rather easy to do . I do n't like easy targets , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUSH TOO EASY A TARGET ? Yeah , and Gingrich was , and Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson  --  all these figures . They 've already been made into cartoons , and some of them , in fact , live cartoon lives . <P> YOU 'RE STILL TOURING A LOT AT 66 . MOST COMICS LOSE THEIR EDGE LONG BEFORE THAT . IS N'T STAND-UP COMEDY A YOUNG PERSON 'S GAME ? I think it has to do with one 's interest in the world . I sort of gave up on this whole human adventure a long time ago , divorced myself from it emotionally . It gives me an artistic detachment that I find valuable . I think the human race has squandered its gift , and I think this country has squandered its promise , for the sake of cell phones and Jet Skis . <P> YOU WERE THE GUEST HOST OF THE VERY FIRST SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE . I ONCE HEARD YOU SAY THAT WAS ONE PERFORMANCE YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY WATCHING TODAY . WHY ? I 'm grinding my jaw and clenching my teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that week , and it just sort of fills me with the feeling of a lost opportunity . Not that it did n't serve its purpose at the time . But it was an opportunity to really have something memorable on tape , and instead I have something that I sort of have to bear .
