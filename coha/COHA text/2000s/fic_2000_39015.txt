At Tin Mill Canal the left headlight burned out . Darker now : eight eyes blinking at the nailing darkness . The sewage treatment plant and its sooty gray sewage-treated smoke rising openly into pinkblack air went grayer . Near the end now nothing to worry about-did you do that , Rootie ? - you saboteur you sly bastard you it 'll take more than that . We approached the bridge looming tall before us and soaring . Upon the western skyline Venus and a crescent perched above the towers . Line of sight . The radius clutching nightgloom all the darktime ; close to the end now , and Tobey tossed his empty beer bottle into the back seat thrusting it against Phoebe 's forehead . Clunk . She punched him in the shoulder , and the action of his reflex swerved the wheel in a sharp skid to the right . Watch it , he said . I 'm the driver . You 're the passenger . <p> We approached the bridge . Do n't see you in the rearview you slow shits . Win . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another beer and opened it against the dashboard . Drunk and darting across space . Eight eyes roaming across the gray industrial postdusk dark . Displacement . A moment , I think . <p> Tobey laughed . Full circle , he was thinking . Is n't that what they call it . <p> Last call at Sudsucker 's was at two . The seven of us had sat in the back by the Atari , two in chairs and five squeezed together on the couch , which we had occupied since dinnertime . The tab was over a hundred dollars . Vince poured out the contents of the final pitcher . <p> These your songs on the jukebox man ? <p> Yeah . <p> Vince and Tobey were playing Maze Craze . My eyes ached from the flashing colors . The bright monochromatic screens . Red and blue dots racing along corridors to the right-hand side of the screen . <p> Won again , Tobey said . <p> Get your kicks now , man . <p> That 's nineteen for me . <p> just wait till we 're on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait , Tobey said . <p> You 're not serious about this race , Adam said . The bartender came to wipe off the coffee table , and they all lifted up their drinks . Adam watched the next maze appear on the screen . He did n't want them to see that he was worried . Around the Beltway . What are they talking about . They 're all drunk . How the he.11 did this get started , he was wondering . You@re not serious , he said to them . <p> Is that a question or a statement of your opinion ? Tobey asked . <p> Adam glared at him . <p> I 'm looking at the video game but I can feel you glaring at me . Answer the fucking question . <p> You answer my question . <p> So it was a question . <p> Jesus help me . <p> No . <p> No you 're not serious ? he asked . The others had stopped their conversation to listen . <p> No , no you 're wrong that I 'm not serious . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be serious too . We 're all serious . We 'll all be serious . We 'll all be serious together . <p> I 'm not riding with you , then , he said . Fuck it . <p> The buses do n't run this late , Adam . You ca n't afford a cab all the way back to Hamilton . You ca n't even afford the beer you just drank . Can you . <p> I do n't think you should do this . <p> Whatever . <p> Shut up , Adam , Ben said . Everyone nodded in agreement . <p> In the cold air on Fort Avenue we stood by the , cars and smoked . Here are the rules , Vince said . We go down Ritchie Highway to exit three and the race starts there . The on-ramp . That 's where it starts . <p> So it ends at the exit three off-ramp , Ben said . <p> No , Vince said . It ends at the end of the Key Bridge . Go around the inner loop and whoever crosses the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that car pay the others back for tonight 's tab , Tobey said . <p> That 's not fair , Vince said . There 's four in your car . <p> I guess that will be added incentive for you to win . <p> I should just hitch a ride home , Adam was saying to Phoebe , shaking his head in disgust . <p> Then do it , she said . <p> Whose side are you on here ? <p> I 'm not on anyone 's side , she said , gently nudging his shoulder . I just think it will be fun . You should n't be so uptight . <p> How fast does that baby go ? Tobey asked . <p> Hundred twenty and it do n't even rattle . Hundred forty you might start to feel a little shake . <p> Phoebe rolled her eyes . <p> Shit , Tobey said . <p> Shit 's ass . <p> Quit your braggin ' and let 's see it . <p> How many miles is it to go around ? Ben asked . <p> I do n't know ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's got ta be fifty at the least . <p> At the very least . <p> We 'll do it in half an hour tops , Tobey said . <p> I 'm with Vince , then , Ben said . I wan na do it in twenty minutes . <p> Tobey drove a turbocharged Cougar . Eighty-nine model year but a ninety-four engine . Black body and a red hood . Surprised they let you across the state line with that ugly hunk of metal , Vince had said when Tobey first moved to Baltimore . Surprised they do n't levy a special redneck tax on your ass . He followed Vince 's Camaro down Ritchie Highway . No traffic . Vince was running the red lights , and Tobey had to run them too to keep up . He glanced around for cops . <p> Past the fast-food restaurants and gas stations . Mile-wide strips of pavement . Down the hill to the exit onto the Beltway . Neon idiot lights . <p> Sprawl . <p> At the on-ramp Vince screeched his tires as he turned right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumper . As they pulled out into the lane we could see Rootie in the back seat of Vince 's car flipping us off . He signaled something to us , pointing toward the hood and bumper of Tobeys car . What 's the bastard trying to say , Tobey said . <p> Hell if I know . <p> Vince sped up to a hundred and went into the left lane . Tobey followed . Vince sped up and slowed down , slamming on his brakes and speeding up and switching to the middle lane and darting around cars . He turned his left turn signal on . He turned his right turn signal on . He turned his rear wipers on . <p> What a dumbass . <p> We 're gon na win . <p> When we passed the Harbor Tunnel Thruway the road had more traffic . Tractor-trailers . Vince pulled into the Washington Boulevard exit lane to pass a pickup truck and managed to steer back onto the road barely in time . Adam gasped when the Camaro jolted back into the main lane . <p> Pass them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> just let him drive , Phoebe said . Even more traffic came onto the road after we crossed under 1-95 . Tobey gripped the wheel . Pass all these fuckers . Steadily smoothly . What they must be thinking . Twice as fast as them at least . Turn their heads . Excitement in their lives . Scared . If they 're scared then they 'll get out of the way . We felt the car pulling to the left , toward the concrete barrier . Out the side window no look out the front window . Reflection in the night . <p> Control . Feel it in the air . Stay out of our way . <p> Phoebe packed the sherlock as we passed Arbutus . Tobey was still following behind the Camaro . Pass them , I said but he was waiting for something to happen . They 'll get stuck behind someone , he was thinking . They 'll have to brake . Got ta do it when they ca n't respond . <p> You got a light ? Tobey asked when it got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You ca n't light a sherlock with the fucking cigarette lighter , he said . <p> The Beltway wall had been completed . Infinite sienna squares . Meant to look like something . Adobe maybe . As I lit the pipe the passing wall squares began to dominate all the peripheries . Count them one two six ten no it 's far too fast . They 're getting away , Phoebe said . <p> They 're not getting away . <p> Just let him drive , Adam said sarcastically . She glared at him . Just let him drive , he said again . <p> We bounced along the broken pavement . Sure do see a lot of Maryland license plates in this damn state , Tobey said . The bowl was cashed , and I put it in the glove box . We bounced along the ridging pavement and the CD player skipped on the bumps . Tobey and I clicked bottles together in a toast , beer sloshing out upon our hands and arms . Rebel yell . We passed Frederick Road . We passed Edmondson Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Adam in the back seat , trying to cheer him up , and she snapped his seat belt undone and pinned his arms and neck in a twisted half nelson . He did n't fight back . She pushed him playfully back into his seat , and he refastened his seat belt . We passed 1-70 . We passed Security Boulevard . Through the cracked window the cool fall air sucked against the glass with a shrill sinister hiss , and every passing car whined lowly in fading Doppler hyperbolas of stunted sound . <p> Whose idea was this , Adam said . It was Vince 's , was n't it ? <p> Phoebe rolled her eyes . <p> I do n't remember , Tobey said . The dashboard 's loose brown plastic rattled loudly . <p> It was Vince 's , Adam said , was n't it ? <p> Vince would n't have been smart enough to think of it , Phoebe said . She rolled her eyes . What the bell is he doing , anyway ? she said . The Camaro was in the far left lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered beneath them . Dumbass is gon na get a flat tire . <p> Blowout at this speed God could you imagine ? The Camaro moved back onto the road . Tobey stayed in the middle lane . There 's a car up there in the shoulder , he said . <p> Cop . <p> No . <p> Could be . <p> No man . This is it . <p> Huh ? <p> They 'll think it 's a cop . This is it . Soon now . He counted : Three . Two . One . <p> The rear of the Camaro swerved twenty degrees to the right as Vince slammed his brakes . Screech . Eighty sixty fifty . We watched them try to right themselves from the side window and then the back windshield as Tobey downshifted to fourth gear and floored the gas . Redline . To the floor . At eighty-five hundred rpms he shifted back up into fifth gear . He shot past the motionless blobs of metal , one hand on the wheel and one hand on the stick , head pressed back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were playing an arcade game . <p> Damn . <p> We gained more ground . <p> Damn is that them way back there ? <p> Do n't slow down , man . <p> Adam shut his eyes and made the sign of the cross . <p> What the hell are you doing ? Phoebe said . You 're not religious . He did n't answer . <p> Damn . <p> Good job . <p> The car on the shoulder was a rusting engineless truck . A dead black hulk . You lost it for a shadow . This is fast . In the Cougar we sped north along the bulging eight-lane ribbon . If we get pulled over I 'm fucked , Tobey was thinking . The red in his eyes . The worried red . Do n't know what Adam 's worried about . I 'm the one going down . Is this Thursday ? Chugachugachuga rumble hurdling above the speakers . <p> Scratchy stringy voices on air : Take me down little Susie take me down . I know you think you 're the queen of the underground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . We were all getting tired . Tobey was feeling the disturbances in his stomach and the insidious night exhaustion . As he belched sore-throated and loudly the air and inner lining of his stomach churned heavily and slow , the enzymes coating wet pink flesh walls with thick gray mercury-we heard this-fastening themselves to the gas and slime like murky algal muscles . You 'll have to take the wheel if I puke , he said . <p> You better not . <p> Tobey did n't answer . <p> I ca n't see them at all now , Phoebe said . The road was emptier . We passed the Northwest Expressway . We passed Reisterstown Road . <p> You know , Phoebe said , you never notice the curves . It 's a circle but you never see it curving . <p> But you feel it curving . <p> We passed Park Heights Avenue . We passed wooded subdivisions and houses sticking up above the wall . Swooosh around the curves . See there are curves . He belched again . We passed Greenspring Avenue . We passed JFX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old metal rattling and metal against metal in grating metallic friction . Above the hum of the engine rose the whirs and the hammering thuds and thunds of thunder , the whines of rubbed-raw body fronds . The rhythm . Stronger now . Later . Heated motion , and the dull cracked shoulder , the yellow reflections reflecting back in yellow . The wall standing dark hushed hale as rubber tracks pithed the thin magnetic chords of open road . <p> Why do n't you drop me off on York , Adam said . I 'll walk to Walter 's apartment . <p> If you wan na just jump out of the car then do it but I 'm not stopping . <p> Come on , Tobey , he said . They 're nowhere in sight . <p> But they will be if I stop to let you off . <p> Come on , Tobey . <p> No one spoke as we drove past 83 North , Charles Street , York Road , Dulaney Valley Road . Providence Road . Tobey maintained his speed . He was wondering if something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue against his teeth . He was listening to the pains in his lower left quadrant wondering if his spleen was swollen from drinking again before he had fully recovered from mono . He was wondering whether or not he 'd get pulled over for reckless driving . Over a hundred and you can spend the night in jail . He could feel the tension in his shoulders forcing his shoulder blades up and outward . He could feel his neck . He could feel his eyes glazing over , and he scrunched them tight and opened them again to snap himself into alertness . Dirt and birdshit on the windshield . Eight eyes staring at gray-white blobs of hardened shit and slime . <p> We never have conversations anymore , I said . <p> Yes we do . <p> No we do n't . <p> He tried to think of something to say . You got anything goin ' on right now ? <p> Ai n't been laid in forever , I said . Back in opwaga again . In the back seat Phoebe rolled her eyes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> No . <p> Organization of people who are n't getting any . <p> We went down the hill . We curved around past the Cromwell Bridge exit . Do they call it Cromwell Bridge because of Oliver Cromwell ? Adam asked . There 's a conversation , he was thinking . Now I 'm helping out and we 're having conversations , he was thinking . <p> No , they call it that because there was a bridge there named Cromwell Bridge . <p> Tobey sped on around the curves . Cops are here with radar sometimes , he was thinking . He kept his sight focused on the shoulders , watching for stopped cars . His tires were skidding on the turns , and he was always conscious of the loose slippery feel of the wheel . The car was getting old . He thought about the rattling and looked in his rear-view mirror and wondered why they were n't catching up . <p> Are we gon na run out of gas ? <p> Shrug . <p> Tobey squirmed around in his seat . Coffee marks stained his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bile and booze the brown and remainders of coffee marks that stained his jeans ; he hacked loudly the trailing smoker 's cough that drumbanged our ears . His eye met the eye of a snowflake splinter in the glass of the windshield , locked , front and away and sandy stringy hair brushing against his collar-brushing shoulders . Two weeks ' beard growth falling from his face ; bird-blue eyes ; chapped lips whose sheathes of dead skin vibrated against each other at the sound of oncoming car horns . How long for you now ? I asked him . <p> Three months . <p> Quitter . <p> Huh ? <p> Like it says on the sign at Crackpot . Right by the back counter where you ask them for cases from the fridge . He swerved back and forth within the middle lane as he massaged his hands against the wheel . Rehab is for quitters . <p> Tobey stared out the window . We passed Perring Parkway . South and north . <p> Is n't it . <p> Three months . <p> Surprised they do n't care that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The speakers hummed . Click croak creak . Swiftly around the circle . What is the word , Tobey was thinking . Circumscription . Circumnavigation . Stringy sandy hair dangling in his face blocking his view : he tossed it back to the side . Whatever . He was tired . In the mirror he saw the redness of his eyes . Where the hell are they . In the mirror he saw what seemed to be a box-shaped shadow at the far bend of the road behind him ; as we rounded a bend it disappeared . <p> How 's Angeline doing ? I asked him . <p> Angela . <p> Well ? <p> I do n't know . <p> The violence of his scoliotic shrug carried spite and scorn . Tension vectors untangled like a snapping coiled skein . Oh that 's right she left . <p> How 's your mom doing ? <p> She 's all right . <p> Coming down this weekend . <p> He nodded . Curling up his nose . Coiling up his nostrils . <p> I could see it . just want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bump . With spittle swishing in his throat he tapped his wart finger on the wheel . White Marsh . Belair Road . How far now . All I wanted . He kept time with the rhythm of the music , sliding his middle finger up and down the plastic , imagining the murky tablature . Where are they . We 're winning . Die in the attempt if . In lockjawed teeth-gritted clarity he saw the bloody bodies crashing into shivery bay brine , the barricades of the bridge soaring clunk into the water . Concrete will sink . D' you do you know this ? <p> Change the song , Phoebe said from the back . Put it on the radio . <p> Tobey looked to the right . Do it you die . <p> I do n't like this tape either , I said . <p> It 's the Stones . <p> But I do n't like it . <p> What are you trying to tell me ? <p> I 'm telling you that I do n't like it . <p> That 's fine . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go down the street . Some grandmomma start breakin ' down on me . Stop breakin ' down . <p> The road was nearly empty . We had the left lane to ourselves . We shot past the walls and trees and 1-95 and cars streaked backwards in strong and straight trajectories into the rearview . Tobey kept the speed between a hundred and a hundred five . Still no sign of them . He looked at his hair in the mirror and adjusted a curl and tossed beer solemnly down his dry throbbing throat . <p> Past 1-95 through Dundalk . Everyone was sleepy . Tobey rewound the tape back to the beginning of the song again . It was the fourth time through the song . He could feel Adam 's agitation . The nerves running down his spine . Tobey listened to the words and waited again for the moment . The twelve or thirteen notes in perfect succession . Seven seconds of melody . The only part of the song he wanted to hear . Otherwise he would n't have repeated it . Wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melody drills down into fingerbone . The nerves in his spine . Plucked like guitar strings . Here it comes again . He gripped the wheel for a curve to the right . Here it comes here it comes here it comes . <p> The tollbooth , Adam said . <p> Goddammit you made me miss it again , goddammit , you piece of shit . <p> The tollbooth at the bridge . <p> Goddammit I listened through that whole song to hear those few seconds you piece of shit and you picked that moment to talk . <p> We 're going to have to stop at the tollbooth at the bridge . <p> Tobey hung his mouth open . <p> I guess no one thought of that , Adam said . They all stared forward . Tobey shook his head in disgust with curled nose and gritting teeth speeding on towards the bay and in the rearview mirror peripherally he saw Adam 's smug smile . The curt smile of Adam in the back seat . <p> You knew about the tollbooth all along , Tobey said , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> We all knew it was there . <p> You remembered It was there . <p> Whatever . <p> There going to catch up , Tobey said . <p> Adam shrugged . <p> We 'll just speed through it , Tobey said . How would you like that ? How does that make you feel ? Sitting back there in your preppy turtleneck sweater rolling your eyes at me thinking , You ca n't drive , you@re going to wreck , you 're going to kill me . Worrying . Thinking the tollbooth , the tollbooth , when we get there it 'll all be okay . Your little trump card . The chips you were hiding under the table . <p> Whatthefuckever . <p> Silence . Driving on . No lights outside . No one talked and we passed some boring shit out on the road and Tobey tapped his finger on the wheel and we did n't see them behind us and the tollbooth and what are we going to do about it and we looked for cops and nothing happened for a while and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably did n't actually happen which probably in a very literal sense did not exist . Driving on . Silence . <p> I looked out at all the houses . I could n't see them but I knew they were behind the wall behind the trees behind the shopping centers . Somebody dose me . I see you ha ha I see what you@re up to . Why do you want me here . Give me the reasons . In your red eyes next to me the reasons where are they . <p> I need to piss , Tobey said . <p> Piss into a bottle and throw it out the window . <p> I ca n't do that while I 'm driving . <p> Oh well , I said . <p> You know what they should have for cars ? he said . <p> What . <p> Some kind of tube that comes up that you could piss into and it would just be a hole straight down to the road . It could just pull up from the floor and you piss into it and just let it snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's disgusting , Phoebe said . <p> You 'd never have to stop . You could just keep driving forever . <p> You 'd have to get gas , I said . <p> But you 'd never have to stop except for gas . <p> I guess . <p> I should design it , he said . I 'll patent it . I 'll make millions . <p> Thousands maybe . <p> Whatever . <p> We were coming up to the tollbooth . One mile . Well , Tobey said , we 'll do what we can while we can . He pushed the gas to the floor . Pedal to the metal , Adam . The car shook . To the left . To the right . He was stretching out the tension in his neck . He was thinking about sex . How it had been three months . How Phoebe always ignored him . He was thinking about sex . He was thinking about jerking off . He was thinking about how the white lines on the road looked short but someone had told him they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering whether anyone could know what he was thinking . He does n't know I can see his thoughts but something makes him nervous . <p> The one woman at the Grind . Eyeing me and I could see the connection as she latched on drooling for me to signal . Long smooth raven hair big brown eyes looked like a Paris model . <p> What are we going to do , I had said . Now that you 've hooked onto my mind . We 've got this power now the two of us as one . What are we going to do . <p> Her mouth hung open for a second before she turned and rushed out onto the street . She did n't understand I thought it was just a mistake I 'd made but she understood . It scared her . They do n't want me to know . <p> I can see these things . Its why I 'm not scared in the car . Nothing will happen . Alone on a mountain at the age of eighty-seven heart failure painless plink into nothing . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you think they are ? I said . Vince and them . <p> He did n't answer . <p> Are you listening to me ? I said . <p> What ? <p> You do n't listen to me . <p> Well what did you say ? <p> You 're not listening to me . <p> He 'd been trying to hide it for so long but I found beneath his disguise the cold words the deadly hemlock raw concoction see glowglowing in our lofting little airboxpocket speeding toward the bay : gloat smirk many many layers but beneath it all of course the old riff . Ca n't do a damn thing without you tagging along . Staring . Hate it when you look at me , he was thinking . Your one beastly eyebrow , connected to itself . You think you know me . You think you 're clever . <p> I think old Sudsucker whatever his name might have been saw the lonely purple aura . Above my head as I ordered the drinks . So he laughed . <p> I think this is very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs in frigid pockets waiting frail and bald hanging in heterogeneous suspension . I think it 's almost three . Waiting outside in the spaces between thrusting air pockets looms the salt and the stench of the bay : I think I can smell it twisting off my nostrils . I think they 'll catch up now . I think this is silly . I think therefore I am . I think I 'm going to do something drastic . We 're going to go swimming , I think . <p> Shit , he said , there 's a line . <p> He screeched to a halt . There were five cars in front of us , and it took almost a minute for us to get to the front . Headlights approached slowly behind us . The car in front of us had to wait for a receipt . Tobey put his head down against the wheel as Vince pulled up behind us . I saw their smug smiles through the side mirror . <p> Goddammit , Tobey said . <p> We paid the toll and took off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at the tollbooth ; he tossed the change at the attendant and followed us , never leaving our bumper . <p> Goddamn fucking piece of shit , Tobey said as he shifted from second to third . Fucking goddamn piece of shit . <p> In the mirror the roundness of my eyes and the circle in my skull plate swirling round again in circles . I like it when it looks this way . The whites of my eyes coated by a shiny film of liquid and look at all the white things : the whitecaps in the water and the lines on the road and Adam 's knuckles wet with spit from where he has bitten them raw and the stars and the moon and the headlights behind us closer closer . Tobey revved it up to the line and shifted to fourth . You ca n't do it , man . <p> Goddamn fucking piece of shit , he repeated all the way across the bridge . <p> Without the left headlight their car did not shine in the light as they pulled out to speed around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt his smile drilling into the back of my neck the vindictive little sonofabitch cocksucker . The wind from miles away hungry you 'll be in it . <p> Goddamn fucking piece of shit . <p> Glowing the cold words smirking beneath the layered riffs of his mind . Trying to hide it for so long . Lofting pocket of box of air of bay speeding toward the sea . He saw me staring . Hate it when you look at me , he was thinking . I sent a thought and he ignored me . Thinking only about the chase . About Vince . They 're all thinking about Vince . Phoebe is thinking about Vince . <p> Goddamn piece of shit bitchass goddamn lump of a car . <p> You want to win , do n't you . <p> I grabbed the wheel with my left hand . They were passing us . I pushed the wheel left and Tobey panicked and grabbed my hand pushing it away looking into my eyes all googly-goggly . For a second I could n't tell anymore what he was thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way over to keep from smashing into us . <p> All the way to the left edge of the bridge . <p> Tobey stabilized us and shot us forward toward the end . All the drums on the radio blasting . All the eyes staring straight ahead at eight straight paths of apparition . All the gulls of the bay winding down through the air whining at us all googly-eyed glimmering hotwired shitting into the water in glee . <p> Fifth gear . <p> We zoomed over the bridge joints as their headlights wavered in the mirror and the tooting horn zoomed in angry cosine waves through the outer sphere of air . <p> What the fuck , man . <p> I shrugged . <p> What the fuck . <p> They were winning . <p> What ? <p> They would have won . <p> He stared at me . <p> I thought you did n't want them to win . <p> He stared at me . <p> They knew about the tollbooth . Like you said . It was their strategy , I said . This was our strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just a game . <p> You wanted to win . <p> I did n't wan na fuckin ' die , bitch . <p> You were trying to win , I said . Adam was watching us intently . Phoebe was rolling her eyes . <p> It was just something to do after the bar so we could keep drinking . Something to do so we would n't have to go home . <p> You wanted to win . <p> Vince is gon na kick your ass . As soon as we stop the car he 's gon na come lunging out his door towards the car and I 'm just gon na point toward you and shake my head and watch it all happen . He slowed down . <p> You wanted to win , I said . <p> He drove on around the circle . Back to exit two . Ritchie Highway . The gas stations the strip malls the sprawl . Vince is gon na kick your ass , he said . I looked into his eyes . There was a moment of doubt but then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were n't then he would n't be saying this . I saw the cold and glowing words smirking from the cracks in his skull . I sent a thought : <p> I knew it would be okay . I knew nothing would happen . <p> But he was n't listening . just watching the lines of the road whizzing by and silence in his mind not listening to me or anything but the lines . Eighty-seven . The mountain . Nothing will happen . Listen to me as I make it not happen . <p>
