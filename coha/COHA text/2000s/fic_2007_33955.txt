Chapter One : Foiled Again This morning on planet Earth , there are one thousand , six hundred , and eighty-six enhanced , gifted , or otherwise-superpowered persons . Of these , one hundred and twenty-six are civilians leading normal lives . Thirty-eight are kept in research facilities funded by the Department of Defense , or foreign equivalents . Two hundred and twenty- six are aquatic , confined to the oceans . Twenty-nine are strictly localized-powerful trees and genii loci , the Great Sphinx , and the Pyramid of Giza . Twenty-five are microscopic ( including the Infinitesimal Seven ) . Three are dogs ; four are cats ; one is a bird . Six are made of gas . One is a mobile electrical effect , more of a weather pattern than a person . Seventy-seven are alien visitors . Thirty-eight are missing . Forty-one are off-continuity , permanent migrs to Earth 's alternate realities and branching timestreams . Six hundred and seventy-eight use their powers to fight crime , while four hundred and forty-one use their powers to commit them . Forty-four are currently confined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is interesting to note that an unusually high proportion have IQs of 300 or more-eighteen to be exact . Including me . I do n't know why it makes you evil . It'sjust what you find at the extreme right edge of the bell curve , the one you 'd get if six billion minds took an intelligence test and you looked at the dozen highest scores . Picture yourself on that graph , sliding rightward and downslope toward the very brightest , down that gradually gentler hill , out over the top million , the top ten thousand-all far smarter than anyone most people ever meet-out to the top thousand-and now things are getting sparser-the last hundred , and it 's not a slope at all now , just a dot every once in a while . Go out to the last few grains of sand , the smartest of the smartest of the smartest , times a thousand . It makes sense that people would be a little odd out here . But you really have to wonder why we all end up in jail . Wake-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than the rest of the inmates . There 's no furniture in my cell-I 'm stretched out on the painted green rectangle where I 'm allowed to sleep . The way my skin is , I hardly feel it anyway . The facility is rated for enhanced offenders , but I 'm the only one currently in residence . I am their showpiece , the pride of the system , and a regular feature on the governor 's tours for visiting dignitaries . They come and watch the performance , to see the tiger in his cage , and I do n't disappoint . The guard raps on the Plexiglas wall with his nightstick , so I get up slowly and move to the red painted circle , where they run a scan , X ray , radiation , and the rest . Then they let me put on clothes . I get eight minutes while they check the route . You can do a lot of thinking in eight minutes . I think about what I 'll do when I get out of here . I think about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a guidebook , a source of advice and inspiration for the next generation of masked criminals , bent prodigies , and lonely geniuses , the ones who 've been taught to feel different , or the ones who knew it from the start . The ones who are smart enough to do something about it . There are things they should hear . Somebody has to tell them . I 'm not a criminal . I did n't steal a car . I did n't sell heroin , or steal an old lady 's purse . I built a quantum fusion reactor in 1978 , and an orbital plasma gun in 1979 , and a giant laser-eyed robot in 1984 . I tried to conquer the world and almost succeeded , twelve times and counting . When they take me away , it goes to the World Court-technically I 'm a sovereign power . You 've seen these trials-the Elemental , Rocking Horse , Dr. Stonehenge . They put you in a glass and steel box . I 'm still dangerous , you know , even without my devices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look like . They read out the long list of charges , like a tribute . There is n't really a trial-it 's not like you 're innocent . But if you 're polite , then at the end they 'll let you say a few words . They 'll ask questions . They 'll want to know why . " Why did you . . . hypnotize the president ? " " Why did you . . . take over Chemical Bank ? " I 'm the smartest man in the world . Once I wore a cape in public , and fought battles against men who could fly , who had metal skin , who could kill you with their eyes . I fought CoreFire to a standstill , and the Super Squadron , and the Champions . Now I have to shuffle through a cafeteria line with men who tried to pass bad checks . Now I have to wonder if there will be chocolate milk in the dispenser . And whether the smartest man in the world has done the smartest thing he could with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armed men while my cell is checked by three specialists with a caseful of instruments . From the tiers come yells , shouts of encouragement , or catcalls . They want to see a show . Then I march , past their eyes , followed by two men in partial armor with bulky high-tech side arms . They have to wait until I pass before their morning lineup . There 's a lot of prison talk about my powers . Inmates believe my eyes can emit laser beams , that my touch is electrical or poisonous , that I come and go as I please through the walls , that I hear everything . People blame things on me-stolen silverware and doors left unlocked . There is even , I note with pride , a gang named after me now : the Impossibles . Mostly white-collar criminals . I 'm allowed to mingle with the general population at mealtimes and in the recreation yard , but I always have a table to myself . I 've fooled them too many times by speed or misdirection . By now they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn in my tray they count the plastic utensils , twice . One guard watches my hands as I eat ; another checks under the table . After I sit down , they make me roll up my sleeves and show my hands , both sides , like a magician . Look at my hands . The skin 's a little cool-about 96.1 degrees F. , if you 're curious-and a little rigid : a shirt with extra starch . That skin can stop a bullet ; it stopped five of them in my latest arrest as I ran up Seventh Avenue in my cape and helmet , sweating through the heavy cloth . The bruises are still there , not quite faded . I have a few other tricks . I 'm strong , much stronger than should be possible for a mammal my size . Given time and inclination , I could overturn a semi , or rip an ATM out of a wall . I 'm not a city-wrecker , not on my own . When Lily and I worked together , she handled that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my main claim to life in the Special Containment Wing , where everything down to the showerheads is either titanium or set two inches deep in reinforced concrete . I 'm also faster than I should be-something in the nerve pathways changed in the accident . Every once in a while a new prisoner comes after me , hoping to make his reputation by breaking a prison-made knife against my ribs , a stolen pencil , or a metal spoon folded over and sharpened . It happens at mealtimes , or in the exercise yard . There is a premonitory hush as soon as he steps into the magic circle , the empty space that moves with me . The guards never step in-maybe it 's policy , to alienate me from the prison population , or maybe they just enjoy seeing me pull the trick , proof again that they 're guarding the fourth-most-infamous man alive . I straighten a little in the metal chair , set my single plastic spoon down on the folding table . After the whip crack of the punch , there is silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carried away and I 'll be left alone again until the next tattooed hopeful makes his play . Inside , I want to keep going , keep fighting until the bullets knock me down , but I never do . I 'm smarter than that . There are stupid criminals and there are smart criminals , and then there is me . This is so you know . I have n't lost any of what I am , my intrinsic menace , just because they took away my devices , my tricks , and my utility belt . I 'm still the brilliant , the appalling , the diabolical Doctor Impossible , damn it . And yes , I am invincible . All superheroes have an origin . They make a big deal of it , the story of how they got their powers and their mission . Bitten by a radioactive bug , they fight crime ; visited by wandering cosmic gods , they search for the lost tablets of so-and-so , and avenge their dead families . And villains ? We come on the scene , costumed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world with an oversized zap gun or cosmic wormhole . But why do we rob banks rather than guard them ? Why did I freeze the Supreme Court , impersonate the Pope , hold the Moon hostage ? I happen to know they 've got practically nothing in my file . A few old aliases , newspaper clippings , testimony from a couple of old enemies . A transcript from the Peterson School , and of course the accident report . The flash was visible for miles . That 's what people talk about when they talk about who I am , a nerd with an attitude and subpar lab skills . But there was another accident , one that nobody saw , a slow disaster that started the morning I arrived there . Nowadays it has a name , Malign Hypercognition Disorder . They 're trying to learn about it from me , trying to figure out whose eyes are going to be looking out at them from behind a mask in thirty years . I have a therapist here , " Steve , " a sad-eyed Rogerian I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you feel angry ? " " What did you really want to steal ? " The things I could tell him-secrets of the universe ! But he wants to know about my childhood . I try to relax and remind myself of my situation-if I kill him , they 'll just send another . It could be worse-there are stories villains tell one another about the secret facilities out in the Nevada desert , the maximum-intensity enhanced containment facilities , for the ones they catch but are truly afraid of , the ones they ca n't kill and can only barely control . Fifty-meter shafts filled with concrete , frozen cells held to near absolute zero . Being here means playing a delicate game-I 'm in the lion 's jaws . I must n't scare them too badly . But Steve has his questions . " Who was the first one to hit you ? " " When did you leave home ? " " Why did you want to control the world ? Do you feel out of control ? " The past creeps in , perils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my line of work to tell too much ; I know that now . And last time I told them everything , giving it all away like a fool , how I was going to do it , how escape was impossible . And they just listened , smirking . And it would have worked , too . The calculations were correct . By the time the bus came that morning , it was raining pretty hard , and the world was a grayed-out sketch of itself , the bus a dim hulk as it approached , the only thing moving . Inside the bus shelter , the rain drummed hollowly on the plastic ceiling , and my glasses were fogging up . It was 6:20 a.m. , and my parents and I were standing , stunned and half-awake , in the parking lot of a Howard Johnson 's in Iowa . I knew that it was a special morning and that I should be feeling something , that this was one of the Big Events in a person 's life , like marriage or a bar mitzvah , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it was supposed to be like . An hour earlier , my alarm had gone off ; my mother stuffed me into a scratchy sweater that was starting to itch in the late September warmth . We trooped out to the car and drove through the gray , silent town , the deserted city center , and turned into the lot by the mighty I-80 . When my mother cut the engine , there were a few seconds of silence as we listened to the rain rapping on the ceiling . Then my father said , " We 'll wait with you at the bus stop . " So we dashed across the steaming asphalt to the Plexiglas shelter . The rain sizzled down and cars and trucks swooshed by , and we stood there . Maybe someone said something . I was thinking about how that fall everything would start without me at Lincoln Middle School . In a few days , everyone I knew would be meeting their new teachers , and the accelerated math class would be starting geometry , doing proofs . In June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education , offering to send me to a new school they were starting called the Peterson School of Math and Science . The year before , they gave a standardized test during homeroom , and everyone who scored in the top half a percentile got a letter . They gave me a talk about whether I would miss my friends or Mr. Reynolds , my math teacher . I told them I would go . I did n't think about how weird it was going to be , waiting for a bus with my clothes in bags . The kids at school would remember me as the kid who never talked , who drew weird pictures and always wore the same clothes , and cried when he dropped his lunch , who was supposed to be really good at math . . . . Whatever happened to him ? Where did he disappear to ? The bus pulled in ; a man got out and checked the fistful of signed forms I held out to him , then threw my bags into the compartment that opened in the metal side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a warm darkness that smelled of strangers ' breath . I walked unsteadily into the dimly fluorescent-lit space , glimpsing faces passing in rows , until I found a pair of empty seats just as the bus roared and pulled out of the parking lot . I remembered to look for a last glimpse of my parents watching me leave , then we surged up the on-ramp and into through traffic . Suddenly I hated the sopping morning and the impersonal helpfulness of my parents , always a little held back , as if they were afraid to know me ; and I was glad to be gone , glad to have no part of them , to be where no one knew me , away from the quiet of their house , their self-restraint . I had a dim inner vision of myself rising up in flame .
