Photograph // BY MARIA PORGES * PHOTOGRAPHS BY JOHN WILSON WHITE Whether made of diamonds or dried leaves , pencil stubs or precious metals , a piece of jewelry is traditionally completed by its relationship to a body moving through time and space . When we 're not wearing them , our rings , pendants and pins- however beautiful-are usually put away in a drawer . In recent years , however , a number of jewelry makers have been exploring ways to create pieces that function independently of their use as personal adornment . Such works are often presented in a fabricated enclosure that serves as a frame or environment , emphasizing their identity as works of art . Though portable and intimately scaled , both object and container are clearly meant to be both seen and touched . In " Jewelry as an Object of Installation , " an exhibition last spring at the Susan Cummins Gallery , Mill Valley , California , sculpturally complex pieces were presented in spare , thoughtful groupings with twodimensional works . The exhibition 's title can be understood both in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intriguing presentation designed by Susan Cummins . " I 'd been considering doing this show for a while , " she explains . " I began thinking about how this type of jewelry would be seen in someone 's collection . I wanted to put together an exhibition that would replicate that situation in the gallery , to find out if the jewelry could stand up to the other things in the room - come out of the drawer , so to speak . " As if to emphasize that viewers were looking at " a home away from home , " several groupings were isolated from the cool neutrality of the gallery 's white walls by being placed within painted rectangles of tan or gray . Cummins 's strategy here was to suggest a domestic interior and to further isolate and define certain themes . Within one such rectangle , for example , a nostalgic atmosphere prevailed . Found materials and vintage text and images were to be found in the still life compositions of Roberta Williamson , multimedia pieces by Kenna Moser , and Jennifer Trask 's framed brooches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could have been the mementos of a maiden aunt-souvenirs of a quieter century . Across the gallery , mementos became " memento mori " in an ensemble of works providing darkly humorous reminders of the inevitable end of all living things . Kiff S lemmons 's his " n ' hers set of dueling pistols ( squirt guns wearable as rings ) , One of Us Has to Go , 2001 , nestled in a beautifully detailed case . On the wall above the pistols , Chester Arnold 's horrifyingly exquisite painting of silvery grubs shows what happens when we do go . We become food for worms-as suggested by the tiny cadaver/brooch , Memento Mori , 2001 , carved by Bruce Metcalf and presented in a theatrical-looking box on the wall next to Arnold 's painting . As Metcalf explains , " The architectural setting is a framing device . I use it the same way that images of buildings were used in Gothic altarpieces , Renaissance picture frames and Victorian toy theaters . Formally , the architecture separates the pin from its surroundings in exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room . " Metcalf 's brooch contains the only precious gems used in the jewelry included in the exhibition . Two small diamonds twinkle in the grim figure 's belly , an ironic signal of one of life 's great truths : we do n't get to take anything with us when we go . Narrative-whether in the form of myths , or the " true " stories of history-framed another group of objects and images in the gallery . David Best 's collage , The Night Shift , 2000 , incorporates gravure illustrations that accompanied published accounts of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York in 1911 . On the shelf below , exquis itely presented in a black box was Sondra Sherman 's Venus and Cupid ( alternately : Mothers and Sons ) , 1991-94 , a complex piece about the goddess of love and her bow-and-arrow-wielding son . Its elements include a voluptuous gold-edged chandelier crystal and a tiny gold pair of Cupid 's wings . Sherman calls the neckpiece " a diptych , in that the crystal pendant representing Venus is worn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearer 's back . I was intrigued by the challenge of creating an evocative object representing subject matter traditional to classical painting , yet articulated specifically by jewelry . " In its installation , Sherman 's neckpiece resonated visually with the gleaming figure of a hermaphroditic angel b Bruce Metcalf on the wall above it . For Metcalf , using the figure in his pieces connects him to historical jewelry traditions , including " GreeN gold earrings , Scythian combs , Victorian mourning jewelry , even pre Columbian castings of people and animals . I 'm simply updating the tradition by rendering the figure in a style derived from cartooning , which is a very American thing to do . " In the largest installation , complex pieces by Mariko Kusumoto and Christina Bothwell evoked a wunderkammer-the collector 's " chamber of wonders " of centuries ago , the predecessor of today 's museums . Other works in the ensemble included intimate paintings by Susan Marie Dopp and Kathleen Jesse , a stark , aboriginal-looking carved mask by Terry Turrell and an earrings and box ensemble by Kiff Stemmons , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obsessively detailed , encyclopedic boxes rhymed visually with Bothwell 's compartmentalized mixed-media wall piece reminiscent of a Joseph Cornell assemblage . Just as important , however , Kusumoto 's works imply participation , not just because one can wear the rings and pins they contain , but because of the arrangement of these multiple elements . Jewelry invites contact , either by the way it is designed for the hand ( to put on or to fasten ) or , like clothing , through the seductive materials from which it is made . Though it was n't possible to handle the pieces and create new arrangements with them , the way the works were presented in relation to each other suggested intriguing possibilities . If , for example , Sherman 's Venus and Cupid had changed places with Slemmons 's dueling pistols , the reading of the works would have shifted in surprising ways . In the course of installation art 's brief history-approximately a hundred years-it has tended to be larger than life , often surrounding the viewer with spectacular sensations and impressions . By contrast , the messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status , commemoration or identity . In a way , the presentations in the Cummins show were on the same condensed , portable scale as jewelry itself . Rather than being epic , they were more like poems containing a few succinct images . Yet even the briefest verse is capable of carrying a powerful message . For the makers of jewelry as " objects of installation , " this intimate medium has become a vehicle for the expression of grand ideas and complex emotions . If anything , the small scale and weight ordained by functionality for wearable art is being seen as a challenge rather than a limitation .
