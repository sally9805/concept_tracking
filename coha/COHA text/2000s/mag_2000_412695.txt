A $95,000 coat Lives a fast and glamorous Life : Auspicious beginnings in Karl Kelly look-alike ; a society Lunch on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue-and finally , the world . Photographed by Armin Linke and Cristina Estadella Photograph TECHNICOLOR DREAM COAT The patchwork mink appeared to Karl Lagerfeld as he was dropping off to sleep ( the same way , he insists , that most of his best ideas arise ) . Here in the atelier , after 305 hours of precise craftsmanship - Fendi-trained hands - Lagerfled 's vision comes to life . Photograph Photograph // LagerfeLd 's Paris apartment ; a brief fling with a Grace Mary Tannen scrambles to keep up . You might spot it cruising Rodeo Drive in a silver Porsche , or it could flicker in your peripheral vision as you watch the crowd in the Piazza San Marco from Caffe Florian . It may slither by as you wait for a table at the Caribou Club in Aspen . Even if you catch only a glimpse , there is no mistaking the tropical splendor of this rara avis , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , and umber . From a distance you might mistake it for silk or velvet . You must get close to realize that it is sheared mink . You must put your hands on it and look through the chiffon lining to discover that the design is not printed on : Each color is a separate piece of dyed fur . With only 14 in captivity , you may not see this coat at all unless you go right now to one of the few stores that harbor it . Catch the next flight to Rome . Walk the via Borgognona , a narrow cobblestone street in the neighborhood where former stables now house the golden names of Valentine , Versace , Gucci , Moschino , and Dolce &; Gabbana . Note the birch trees in square planters , the fresh paint on the buildings , because this too is part of the story of the coat that hangs from a peg on the wall just inside the tall arched window of the Fendi store . You could say that this coat began its existence more than a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret instructions from Fendi , agents bought only the densest and softest ranch-raised-mink pelts , the ones that stand up best to close shearing ; or 75 years ago when Edoardo and Adele Casagrande Fendi established a small leather and fur shop on via del Plebiscite in Rome ; or in 1965 when Carla and Anna , two of the five young Fendi daughters , rethinking the traditional heavy fur coat , began cutting smaller shoulders and leaner bodies , then teamed up with a radical designer named Karl Lagerfeld . In a move that would astonish even Thorstein Veblen , philosopher of conspicuous consumption , Lagerfeld and Fendi transformed fur-a status symbol dating back to the Cro  --  Magnon era-into a silken , supple thing that gives no more warmth than might be needed to shield one 's neck from an overzealous air conditioner . Under Lagerfeld 's encouragement , Fendi craftsmen learned to barber and dye , cut and pierce , pleat and drape , transforming far into a substance sometimes virtually unrecognizable , except by those who know . If you wander the twisting streets down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Rivers , you might say the coat began in the 17th century , when Bernini transformed Rome into a city of the baroque . The daring way stone is carved to appear weightless , the dramatic twisting of forms , so subversive of classical ideals , finds an echo in the way Fendi handles fur . Baroque style was a response to the end of absolutism in religious and political life . Today we are in a new baroque era , in which the old centers do not hold : Information ricochets around the globe , and fortunes flare and extinguish like flickering lights . This $95,000 coat-precious fur meticulously crafted , whose real worth could be under-stood only by a fashion aficionado-is as much a monument to the baroque spirit of our times as Bernini 's fountain was to his . You retrace your steps to the Fendi studio , located in a palazzo around the corner from the shop . In the reception area , waiting for Lagerfeld to emerge , you fasten on a life-size portrait of Adele Casagrande Fendi , founder and patron saint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress that blends prettily with surrounding Chinese porcelain . Her smile is calm , her brown eyes steady . The Technicolor dream coat may be on the nervy brink of fashion , but it owes its existence to the solid work ethic of this woman , who chose to keep the family enterprise going when her husband became ill in 1946 , who brought her five daughters into the business when they were still teenagers . Although Adele was actively involved until her death in 1978 , she had the wisdom to let her daughters have their say . She allowed daughter Carla to take her by the hand and lead her to via Borgognona-then a modest street of small artisans-and persuade her to buy a small space for a boutique , and later followed Anna 's advice to take over the old cinema for a much  --  enlarged store . ( Since 1975 , Anna has been president of her street association , instigating the birch trees in the planters , among other improvements that give this street a knowing air of luxe . ) Adele also had the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Lagerfeld-a burly form in black , frizzy gray hair caught back in a ponytail-bursts into the room , takes a seat , and begins to explain his inspiration for the coat . " I wanted to use technique , " he says . ( Lagerfeld has spent years challenging the craftsmanship of the famed Fendi atelier . One season , he asked for-and got-fur cut and seamed to look like contour-plowed fields . ) " I wanted color and design in a playtime mood-Kandinsky and Japanese pop , " Lagerfeld says . The baroque combination of early-20th-century expressionist painting and Hello Kitty kitsch appeared to him in a three-dimensional vision ( " a fashion vision , not a religious vision " ) as he was dropping off to sleep . He insists this happens often . " I have to put on a light and sketch , " he says . " Most of my best ideas are like that . Sometimes I 'm scared myself . " Behind oversize glasses shaded to obscure his eyes , is he laughing ? Could this elaborate design have come together from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUNWAY How do you persuade a woman to buy a $95,000 coat ? Send it down the catwalk with flashy accessories , to the sound of remixed ' ' 60s rock anthems . Fendi 's show Left the press gasping-and store buyers convinced . // You see the drawing at the Fendi factory just outside Rome , where you are greeted by Anna Fendi and her daughter Sylvia Venturini , originator of the enormously popular Fendi baguette , who also works closely with her mother and Aunt Carla on the furs . The word factory conveys the industrial style of this new structure , with its polished concrete floors , shiny exposed-zinc-ductwork ceilings , and well-lit , spacious workrooms , but atelier better describes the way no more than a dozen workers share a room , and how almost everyone ( clad in white lab coats ) is cutting and sewing by hand . The craftsmen here trained at Fendi . Some are second generation . ( Sewing at one table is a man whose mother worked here when she was pregnant with him . ) Anna , who speaks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blonde hair in a French twist . Sylvia is spirited and confident , even a little mischievous . Her blonde hair is cut in a trendy shag . They show you a line drawing of the coat , with cryptic notations and arrows . It is all there , they insist , everything they need to know . But when they walk you through the steps of making the coat , you see that it did not simply materialize in the miraculous manner suggested by Lagerfeld . First the furs were shipped to Fendi to have their quality verified and then sent off to the tanners in Milan , some of whom work exclusively for the house . Next , 400 samples of dyed fur were sent back so Lagerfeld could choose the colors he wanted . A full-size prototype of the coat was constructed in unbleached canvas . ( Sculptural and chaste , it covers a dressmaker 's dummy in the cutting room . ) After Lagerfeld and Fendi approved the canvas , the shapes had to be fitted on the body . Many sample combinations of circles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best was chosen . A paper pattern was made , with each piece labeled by color . At a drafting table a woman is working with compass and ruler , drawing a new pattern , as each size requires its own . Another woman fits a circle of mink into a larger square with a special machine that sews edge-to-edge , without overlap . Every few inches she darts a metal rod the size of a crochet hook into the seam to make certain no fur catches on the inside . Farther along , a woman is shaping a pieced-together sleeve : Placing it fur-side down , she mists it with water , stretches the sleeve to shape , then pins it on a board to dry for a day or two . The shaped parts are sewn together by hand in the finishing room , the seams overlaid by patent-leather strips . The lining is then sewn in by hand . It has taken 305 hours of highly skilled labor to realize Lagerfeld 's bedtime vision . But the story does not end with the completed garment buttoned onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the market . Who will buy this coat ? " I never think of who will wear it , " says Lagerfeld , with a certain artistic disdain . But Anna says , " We believe everything we create is to be sold . We never do a coat for the runway . We like to see it on the people . " She can imagine the coat worn by " a very attractive young Roman-modern , chic , with dark hair and light skin . " Whoever she is , she must have charm and character . Perhaps she 'll be from the United States . " When the American woman is chic , " Anna says , " she is more chic than anyone else . " How do you persuade the chic woman who happens to have $95,000 in her clothing allowance for outerwear that this particular garment will make her the envy of her friends and assure her a place in the fashion pantheon ? First you have to convince an audience of the jet-lagged and jaded that what they are seeing is the distillation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat on a model with free-flowing hair , let a luscious silk dress peek out underneath , get some gold ankle  --  strap high heels , and surround it with a parade of opulence . The fashion press was left gasping for adjectives when Fendi unleashed its runway show last February in Milan . Marching to the sounds of remixed ' ' 60s anthems of rebellion , models flashed gold belts , maxed-out sunglasses , green leather stiletto boots , and not a drop of restraint . " There 's something happening here , " the soundtrack promised . " What it is ai n't exactly clear ... One thing I can tell you is you got to be free .... " Free to spend it , show it off , flaunt it . In a season of fashion excess , Fendi had raised the stakes . Store buyers were biting their nails over the cost of the coat . At the same time , they knew they had to have it . Four of the coats are going to the store on via Borgognona . Inside , salesperson Nina Ingster-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body-balls up the coat to show how it wo n't wrinkle . It 's great over jeans , she announces , propping up the collar as her customer , Dominique Gianfrone , who looks like Grace Kelly , watches her reflection . In rapid patter , Ingster continues her sell : It would be divine over an evening gown ; it looks like velvet but lighter , softer , and more practical ( water ca n't harm it ) . She pulls it tight across the rib cage so Gianfrone is practically popping out . It 's cut to fit tight , " strizzato , " Ingster tells her . " Even I look busty in it . It 's intelligent . Something that 's intelligent you can always wear . It 's not too warm , for the new winters . " Nino Masso , short , balding , smiling-a quiet foil to Ingster 's irrepressibility-appears with his pins . There might be a millimeter to take off the sleeve , some padding added to the back of the shoulder . Finally , though , Gianfrone decides that an unlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to wear while ferrying her three children around . Who will buy this coat ? " You have to be very sophisticated , " says Ingster , " a sophisticated woman from Hong Kong , or an Italian woman my age early 50s . Not the beautiful young Russian , because you do n't see the money . " Or maybe a " nut , " she says , who loves the coat but does n't understand its value , and a " nut boyfriend " who is too macho to back out of buying it when he learns the price . An enterprise with one boutique in Rome could not have produced this coat . It required the backing of a billion-dollar global corporation , which is what Fendi has just joined . ( Last year a 51 percent majority stake sold to Prada and luxury conglomerate LVMH . ) Although the Fendis-including the third generation-are as committed as ever to working in the company , they now have the financial clout to open even more locations worldwide . The coat will journey to France , Japan , Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States-one to Manhasset , one to Aspen , and two to New York . On a brilliant day in early June , Carla , president of the board of directors , is in New York City to host a lunch and trunk show for 50 or so customers on an empty floor above the Fendi shop on Fifth Avenue . She walks the display area , seeing to every detail and memorizing the placement of each object . She turns her attention to the line of Fendi shopping bags in the greeting area . Each " goody bag " holds a book about Rome and the bag of the moment , a crescent shape made from a Fendi scarf Retailing for $895 , the bag is a princely gift , but then Fendi has great plans for these guests . Although a few are longtime clients , most are in their late 20s and early 30s . They are handbag addicts whom Fendi hopes to get hooked on furs . Each one is slim and beautiful . They wear Jean jackets and chiffon skirts , cropped pants , summer-weight cashmere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else . Carla moves through this crowd as if on oiled wheels , greeting with cheek kisses , and in some cases bear hugs . She takes one guest , in a pink , pierced suede skirt by Fendi , directly to the coat . It settles onto the customer 's body like a second skin . Carla adjusts the collar and caresses the fur over the woman 's hips , smiling lovingly at the reflection . She is not a saleswoman hoping to unload a garment but rather a matchmaker who believes that coat and customer belong together . At one o'clock the guests are guided into the dining room , where they find their first names on place cards : Blaine for Blaine Trump , Nan for Nan Kempner . Handsome young waiters in white dinner jackets and gloves pour red and white wine and distribute plates with perfect slices of white chicken breast heaped with a salad of seedlings , an ethereal feast for hummingbird women . The background music suddenly increases in volume and takes over the room . It 's the theme of the Fendi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shaved-mink coats in op-art designs , but none so intricate or startling as the coat in question . At 1:40 , even as the semi-freddo desserts are being served , guests rush off . As they pass again through the display area , they see the models chatting and drinking champagne , glossier versions of the guests who had been there not an hour before . A chosen few invitees descend to the store with Carla . Kempner , who arrived in a hot-pink chiffon blouse appliqued with acid-green shaved mink ( from the spring collection ) , has been a poster child for Fendi furs since she walked into the store in Rome more than 20 years ago , lured by a painted shearling coat . There she bumped into a friend who introduced her to the sisters , and it has been love ever since . Carla coaxes Nan into the coat . Nan obligingly vamps and swaggers . The coat , with its deep vent , makes her look young and daring , a fashion rebel to the end . But she prefers the pink with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . Suddenly her eyes are bluer , more penetrating . Does she have the steeliness , the ferocity to carry off this mantle ? In the weeks following the trunk show , one of the guests comes in to try on the coat , then schedules another appointment to try it on again . It 's not a purchase that 's lightly made . The holographic vision that seared itself into Karl Lagerfeld 's brain has taken more than a year to materialize . In stores around the globe , it is being buttoned up , smoothed over hips , propped at the collar . Hands are slipping into the pockets . Heads are turning to see just how deep the vent goes in the back . Finally , only 14 will have the courage and the cash to walk away with this pivotal piece , the coat that defines the present even as it recedes into the past .
