<p> California in 1996 began paying schools an extra $ 850 for every student from kindergarten through third grade who was in a class with 20 or fewer children . Cost : $ 1.6 billion this year . <p> Virginia reduced a local property tax on cars in 1997 and promised to reimburse cities and towns for the lost revenue . Cost : $ 874 million this year . <p> Wisconsin started helping senior citizens pay for prescription drugs in September . Cost : $ 50 million this year , more than $ 88 million next year . <p> State governments are struggling to pay for expensive programs that were approved or expanded during the economic surge of the late 1990s . Although the economy began to cool in 2000 , state and local spending has continued to grow , increasing by an annual rate of 4.2% in the first nine months of 2002 . <p> Governors and legislatures meeting this month in 42 states must decide whether to raise taxes or retreat from spending promises made before the recession set in . But most of the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actual declines in spending from last year . <p> Even so , the political pain is keen . " States made huge spending commitments during the boom years , and now they ca n't meet them , " says Stephen Slivinski , director of tax and budget studies at the Goldwater Institute , a fiscally conservative research group in Phoenix . " There 's a crisis mentality in the state legislatures . " <p> Spending by state governments has risen dramatically in the past decade  --  up 62% , compared with a 30% rate of inflation . The extra money has gone mostly to the two big items that account for 60% of state spending : education and Medicaid health care for the poor . Yet nearly every program  --  from law enforcement to parks  --  has benefited . Many states also cut tax rates . <p> States could afford the increased spending when tax collections were rising briskly , as they did during the previous decade . But tax revenue declined in 2002 amid rising unemployment , huge stock market losses and spending cutbacks by businesses . <p> Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months that ended June 30 , the Census Bureau reports . That decline was offset somewhat by increases in federal aid and other revenue . Many states met their higher spending obligations by tapping reserve quarter that ended Sept. 30 . But that 's not enough to match spending increases that legislatures have approved . <p> Accounting ' often fuzzy ' <p> The actual size of the budget problems in many states is not clear because public officials often do not follow standard accounting practices . <p> " Budgets are political documents . The accounting is often fuzzy or downright ridiculous , especially in California , " says Daniel J.B. Mitchell , a management professor at the University of California-Los Angeles . Even basic statistics , such as the size of the budget , are reported in ways that make little accounting sense , he says . <p> In California , which has the biggest budget problem , politicians often put state spending at $ 78 billion for the 12 months that end June 30 . That is the size of the general fund , an operating fund that provides most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key programs . <p> Gov . Gray Davis and legislators sometimes say California will spend $ 100 billion this year . That figure includes tax revenue for other programs . Davis ' budget reports spending as $ 147 billion . That figure includes $ 47 billion in federal money . But the total is actually $ 205 billion , according to rules established by the accounting industry . That figure counts all spending , including contributions to the retirement funds of state employees . The number appears in Appendix 17 on the 296th page of the governor 's 352-page budget for 2002-03 . <p> Similar confusion surrounds the amount of spending California must cut to balance its books . Davis says the state has a $ 35 billion shortfall ; the Legislature 's budget office puts the gap at $ 23 billion . <p> But Mitchell says " shortfall " and " budget gap " are political terms , not accounting ones . " The public mistakenly thinks this means you have to cut spending or raise taxes by this amount to balance the budget , " he says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature approved spending and what it has money to pay for . California 's budget " shortfall " is largely caused by the Legislature 's plan to increase general fund spending from $ 78 billion this year to $ 85 billion next year and $ 91 billion in 2005 . Those proposed increases are likely to be cut . It 's like an employee who expects a 5% raise , gets only 3% and complains about a 2% pay cut . <p> Mitchell says questionable accounting makes it hard for the public and legislators to understand the state 's true financial condition . <p> California reported a $ 3 billion surplus in the budget year that ended June 30 , 2001 , just as the high-tech bubble was bursting . But the state actually spent $ 5 billion more than it took in  --  a deficit . <p> " California is in trouble now because it ran huge deficits even at the peak of the revenue cycle , " Mitchell says . " If you run deficits in good times , you 're bound to have a fiscal crisis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> Public officials agree on one thing : trimming spending is painful . " Politicians like to be liked . We like to spend money to help people , " says Minnesota state Sen. Richard Cohen , a Democrat who chairs the finance committee . <p> Minnesota tax collections are expected to rise 6.6% over the next two years , but " even if there 's some increase in revenue , it 's nowhere near what we need , " Cohen says . " We 've got old spending that we have to pay for now . " For example , the Legislature cut local property taxes $ 1 billion starting in 2002 and promised to reimburse school districts for the lost revenue . But the state does n't have enough money to do so . <p> In addition , Minnesota and other states are paying large increases in the cost of health care for the poor . Medicaid costs rose 9% last year . The states pay an average of 45% of Medicaid 's cost ; the federal government pays the rest . <p> Taxpayers ' desire for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Dominic Calabro of Florida TaxWatch , an advocacy group that supports low taxes . " We have not adjusted psychologically to the fact that the boom time is over . " <p> In November , for example , Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring reduced class size starting this fall , a program that will cost more than $ 1 billion a year . Voters also approved publicly funded pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds starting in 2005 . That will cost an additional $ 500 million a year . <p> Florida tax revenue is up 5% this year  --  not enough to fulfill the spending desires of voters . " We 've met the enemy , and it is us , " Calabro says . " That 's the give and take of democracy . " <p> General funds fuel spending <p> About half of state spending comes from " general funds , " which pay for major programs such as education and health care for the poor .
