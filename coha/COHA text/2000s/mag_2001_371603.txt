Harvest season is over for most crops , but there 's still one more to gather : your stock-market losses . Though the market has rallied in recent weeks , over the course of the calendar year most of your stocks have probably wilted . Selling now may seem like admitting defeat just when some of your old favorite shares are starting to show signs of new life . The end of the year , however , is the time when investors traditionally separate the wheat from the chaff with an eye toward both portfolio cleanup and tax savings . <P> The first question to ask yourself is whether there are other investments that are likely to grow faster , or balance your portfolio better , than the ones that you own . Often the answer is yes , and in those cases you should try to sell winners and losers in equal proportions to minimize your tax bill . " You can take the losses today , still remain in the market and use those losses to offset current capital gains , " says financial planner Altair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that with a mutual fund , you could have a capital gain even if your fund is down overall this year . A fund 's distribution of capital gains may be based on transactions that its manager made earlier in the year , and those distributions are taxable . <P> But even if you do n't have any winning stocks in this bear-market year  --  or any that you want to sell  --  it can make good tax sense to sell at least some of your losers . <P> First , you should consider taking as much as $3,000 in capital losses  --  the maximum amount you can use to offset ordinary income . If you 're in the 27.5% tax bracket , this move can save you $825  --  or more if your state offers deductions . <P> Next you should consider taking losses this year that you can use to offset future capital gains . Afraid to sell for fear the stock or fund will come roaring back ? You can always record the loss and then buy back the same security 31 days later without violating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell a security from your taxable account and then immediately purchase the same security in your tax-sheltered IRA or 401(k) account , says Martin Nissenbaum , Ernst &; Young 's national director of personal income tax planning . <P> If you want to keep the same asset allocation in your taxable account , consider selling a security at a loss and buying back a similar holding right away . Here 's one way to do it : say your favorite computer stock lost more than half its value this year ; you can sell it and then immediately buy shares in another computer company or in a technology mutual fund . <P> Harvesting losses with a mutual fund is a little easier . Let 's say you purchased $10,000 of a large-cap growth fund , and now , with the market 's slide , the fund is worth less than $7,600  --  a likely scenario , considering that the average large-cap growth fund is down more than 24% this year to date . You could sell the large-cap growth fund and invest the money in another fund family 's large-cap growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wo n't alter your asset-class mix , and your investment strategy stays intact .
