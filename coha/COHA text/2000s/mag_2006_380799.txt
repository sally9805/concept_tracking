On the day last week that lobbyist Jack Abramoff was sentenced to prison for fraud , the Senate passed a new ethics bill . The House will take up the issue next . Here 's a look at reforms Congress seems willing to accept : <P> What does the Senate bill do ? It bars lobbyists from buying gifts and meals for legislators , but it leaves a big loophole : firms and organizations represented by those lobbyists may still dole out freebies . Privately funded trips would still be allowed if lawmakers get prior approval from the ethics committee . The bill would bar retiring legislators and senior aides from lobbying Congress for two years . It would also require lobbyists to file more frequent , more detailed reports on their activities , which would be posted on the Net . <P> What about the House version ? That bill , which may come to a vote this month , contains similar disclosure requirements . But it would not limit meals or gifts  --  and would ban privately funded travel for just this year . <P> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nixed : curbs on the millions of dollars that lobbyists funnel to campaigns and an independent in-house investigator to enforce the rules . <P> How would the bills affect lobbying on Capitol Hill ? The Senate bill , claims cosponsor Christopher Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , would effectively put a NOT FOR SALE sign in front of the Capitol . But it is so weak that some reformers  --  including Republican John McCain and Democrat Russell Feingold  --  voted no . Both bills , says Fred Wertheimer , head of the nonpartisan Democracy 21 watchdog group , " leave lobbyists free to function in Congress exactly the way they have been functioning .
