I KNOW FROM LUCY 'S VOICE THAT SHE IS SCARED . Rarely is my brilliant , forceful , helicopter-piloting , fitness-obsessed , **29;436;TOOLONG niece scared . " I feel really bad , " she continues to repeat herself over the phone as Marino maintains his position on my bed and I pace . " You should n't , " I tell her . " The police do n't want anybody here , and believe me , you do n't want to be here . I guess you 're staying with Jo and that 's good , " I say this to her as if it makes no difference to me , as if it does n't bother me that she is not here and I have n't seen her all day . It does make a difference . It does bother me . But it is my old habit to give people an out . I do n't like to be rejected , especially by Lucy Farinelli , whom I have raised like a daughter . She hesitates before answering . " Actually , I 'm downtown at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . The Jefferson is the grandest hotel in the city , and I do n't know why she would go to a hotel at all , much less an elegant , expensive one . Tears sting my eyes and I force them back , clearing my throat , shoving down hurt . " Oh , " is all I say . " Well , that 's good . I guess Jo 's with you at the hotel , then . " " No , with her family . Look , I just checked in . I 've got a room for you . Why do n't I come get you ? " " A hotel 's probably not a good idea right now . " She thought of me and wants me with her . I feel a little better . " Anna 's asked me to stay with her . In light of everything , I think it 's best for me to go on to her house . She 's invited you , too.But I guess you 're settled . " " How did Anna know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news ? " Since the attempt on my life happened at a very late hour , it wo n't be in the newspapers until tomorrow morning . But I expect there has been a storm of news breaks over the radio and on television . I do n't know how Anna knew , now that I think about it . Lucy says she needs to stay put but will try to drop by later tonight . We hang up . " The media finds out you 're in a hotel , that 's all you need . They 'll be behind every bush , " Marino says with a hard frown , looking like hell . " Where 's Lucy staying ? " I repeat what she told me and almost wish I had n't talked to her . All it did was make me feel worse . Trapped , I feel trapped , as if I am inside a diving bell a thousand feet under the sea , detached , light-headed , the world beyond me suddenly unrecognizable and surreal . I am numb yet every nerve is on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You got ta be kidding ! She win the lottery or something ? She not worried about the media finding her , too ? What the shit 's gotten into her ? " I resume packing . I ca n't answer his questions . I am so tired of questions . " And she ai n't at Jo 's house . Huh , " he goes on , " that 's interesting . Huh . Never thought that would last . " He yawns loudly and rubs his thick-featured , stubbly face as he watches me drape suits over a chair , continuing to pick out clothes for the office . To give Marino credit , he has tried to be even-tempered , even considerate , since I got home from the hospital . Decent behavior is difficult for him given the best of circumstances , which certainly are not the ones he finds himself in at present . He is strung out , sleep-deprived and fueled by caffeine and junk food , and I wo n't allow him to smoke inside my house . It was simply a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped back into his rude , big-mouthed character . I witness the metamorphosis and am strangely relieved by it . I am desperate for things familiar , no matter how unpleasant . Marino starts talking about what Lucy did last night when she pulled up in front of the house and discovered Jean-Baptiste Chandonne and me in my snowy front yard . " Hey , it 's not that I blame her for wanting to blow the squirrel 's brains out , " Marino gives me his commentary . " But that 's where your training 's got to come in . Do n't matter if it 's your aunt or your kid involved , you got to do what you 're trained to do , and she did n't . She sure as hell did n't . What she did was go ape-shit . " " I 've seen you go ape-shit a few times in your life , " I remind him . " Well , it 's my personal opinion they never should have thrown her into that undercover work down there in Miami . " Lucy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holidays , among other reasons . " Sometimes people get too close to the bad guys and start identifying with them . Lucy 's in a kill mode . She 's gotten trigger-happy , Doc . " " That 's not fair . " I realize I have packed too many pairs of shoes . " Tell me what you would have done if you 'd gotten to my house first instead of her . " I stop what I am doing and look at him . " At least take a nanosecond to assess the situation before I went in there and put a gun to the asshole 's head . Shit . The guy was so fucked up he could n't even see what he was doing . He 's screaming bloody murder because he 's got this chemical shit you threw in his eyes . He was n't armed by this point . He was n't going to be hurting nobody . That was obvious right away . And it was obvious you was hurt , too . So if it had been me , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even do that . She 's a wild card , Doc . And no , I did n't want her in the house with all this going on . That 's why we interviewed her down at the station , got her statements in a neutral place to get her calmed down . " " I do n't consider an interrogation room a neutral place , " I reply . " Well , being inside the house where your Aunt Kay almost got whacked ai n't exactly neutral , either . " I do n't disagree with him , but sarcasm is poisoning his tone . I begin to resent it . " All the same , I got to tell you I 've got a really bad feeling about her being alone in a hotel right now , " he adds , rubbing his face again , and no matter what he says to the contrary , he thinks the world of my niece and would do anything for her . He has known her since she was ten , and he introduced her to trucks and big engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he now criticizes her for having in her life . " I might just check on the little shit after I drop you off at Anna 's . Not that anybody seems to care about my bad feelings , " he jumps back several thoughts . " Like Jay Talley . Of course , it ai n't my business . The self-centered bastard . " " He waited with me the entire time at the hospital , " I defend Jay yet one more time , deflecting Marino 's naked jealousy . Jay is ATF 's Interpol liaison . I do n't know him very well but slept with him in Paris four days ago . " And I was there thirteen or fourteen hours , " I go on as Marino practically rolls his eyes . " I do n't call that self-centered . " " Jesus ! " Marino exclaims . " Where 'd you hear that fairy tale ? " His eyes burn with resentment . He despises Jay and did the first time he ever laid eyes on him in France . " I ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital all that time ? He did n't wait for you ! That 's total bullshit . He took you there on his fucking white horse and came right back here . Then he called to see when you was going to be ready to check out and slithered back to the hospital and picked you up . " " Which makes good sense . " I do n't show my dismay . " No point in sitting and doing nothing . And he never said he was there the entire time . I just assumed it . " " Yeah , why ? Because he let you assume it . He lets you think something that is n't true , and you ai n't bothered by that ? In my book , that 's known as a character flaw . It 's called lying .... What ? " He abruptly changes his tone . Someone is in my doorway . A uniformed officer whose nameplate reads M. I. Calloway steps inside my bedroom . " I 'm sorry , " she addresses Marino right off . " Captain , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , now you know . " He gives her a black look . " Dr. Scarpetta ? " Her wide eyes are like Ping-Pong balls , bouncing back and forth between Marino and me . " I need to ask you about the jar . Where the jar of the chemical , the formulin ... " " Formalin , " I quietly correct her . " Right , " she says . " Exactly , I mean , where exactly was the jar when you picked it up ? " Marino remains on the bed , as if he makes himself at home on the foot of my bed every day of his life . He starts feeling for his cigarettes . " The coffee table in the great room , " I answer Callaway . " I 've already told everybody that . " " Yes , ma'am , but where on the coffee table ? It 's a pretty big coffee table . I 'm really sorry to bother you with all this . It 's just we 're trying to reconstruct how it all happened , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Marino slowly shakes a Lucky Strike loose from the pack . " Callaway ? " He does n't even look at her . " Since when are you a detective ? Do n't seem I remember you being in A Squad . " He is the head of the Richmond Police Department 's violent crime unit known as A Squad . " We just are n't sure where the jar was , Captain . " Her cheeks burn . The cops probably assumed a woman coming back here to question me would be less intrusive than a male . Perhaps her comrades sent her back here for that reason , or maybe it was simply that she got the assignment because no one else wanted to tangle with me . " When you walk into the great room and face the coffee table , it 's the right corner of the table closest to you , " I say to her . I have been through this many times . Nothing is clear . What happened is a blur , an unreal torquing of reality . " And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical on him ? " Callaway asks me . " No . I was on the other side of the couch . Near the sliding glass door . He was chasing me and that 's where I ended up , " I explain . " And after that you ran directly out of the house ... ? " Calloway scratches through something she is writing on her small memo pad . " Through the dining room , " I interrupt her . " Where my gun was , where I happened to have set it on the dining room table earlier in the evening . Not a good place to leave it , I admit . " My mind meanders . I feel as if I have severe jet lag . " I hit the panic alarm and went out the front door . With the gun , the Glock . But I slipped on ice and fractured my elbow . I could n't pull the slide back , not with just one hand . " She writes this down , too . My story is tired and the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might become irrational , and no cop on this planet has ever seen me irrational . " You never fired it ? " She glances up at me and wets her lips . " I could n't cock it . " " You never tried to fire it ? " " I do n't know what you mean by try . I could n't cock it . " " But you tried to ? " " You need a translator or something ? " Marino erupts . The ominous way he stares at M. I. Calloway reminds me of the red dot a laser sight marks on a person before a bullet follows . " The gun was n't cocked and she did n't fire it , you got that ? " he repeats slowly and rudely . " How many cartridges you have in the magazine ? " He directs this to me . " Eighteen ? It 's a Glock Seventeen , takes eighteen in the mag , one in the chamber , right ? " " I do n't know , " I tell him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get that many rounds in it because the spring 's stiff , the spring in the magazine . " " Right , right . You remember the last time you shot that gun ? " he then asks me . " Whenever I was at the range last . Months at least . " " You always clean your guns after you go to the range , do n't you , Doc . " This is a statement , not an inquiry . Marino knows my habits and routines . " Yes . " I am standing in the middle of my bedroom , blinking . I have a headache and the lights hurt my eyes . " You looked at the gun , Calloway ? I mean , you 've examined it , right ? " He fixes her in his laser sight again . " So what 's the deal ? " He flaps a hand at her as if she is a stupid nuisance . " Tell me what you found . " She hesitates . I sense she does n't want to give out information in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture about to precipitate . I decide on two skirts , one navy blue , one gray , and drape them over the chair . " There are fourteen rounds in the magazine , " Calloway tells him in a robotic military tone . " There was n't one in the chamber . It was n't cocked . And it looks clean . " " Well , well . Then it was n't cocked and she did n't shoot it . And it was a dark and stormy nightand three Indians sat around a campfire . We want to go round and round , or can we fuckingmove along ? " He is sweating and his body odor rises with his heat . " Look , there 's nothing new to add , " I say , suddenly on the verge of tears , cold and trembling and smelling Chandonne 's awful stench again . " And why was it you had the jar in your home ? And what exactly was in it ? That stuff you use in the morgue , right ? " Calloway positions herself to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ten percent dilution of formaldehyde known as formalin , " I say . " It 's used in the morgue to fix tissue , yes . Sections of organs . Skin , in this case . " I dashed a caustic chemical into the eyes of another human being . I maimed him . Maybe I permanently blinded him . I imagine him strapped to a bed on the ninth-floor prison ward of the Medical College of Virginia . I saved my own life and feel no satisfaction in that fact . All I feel is ruined . " So you had human tissue in your house . The skin . A tattoo . From that unidentified body at the port ? The one in the cargo container ? " The sound of Calloway 's voice , of her pen , of pages flipping , reminds me of reporters . " I do n't mean to be dense , but why would you have something like that at your house ? " I go on to explain that we have had a very difficult time identifying the body from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and last week I drove to Petersburg and had an experienced tattoo artist look at the tattoo from my case . I came directly home afterward , which is why the tattoo in its jar of formalin happened to be in my house last night . " Ordinarily , I would n't have something like that in my house , " I add . " You kept it at your house for a week ? " she asks with a dubious expression . " A lot was happening . Kim Luong was murdered . My niece was almost killed in a shoot-out in Miami . I was called out of the country , to Lyon , France . Interpol wanted to see me , wanted to talk about seven women he " I mean Chandonne " probably murdered in Paris and the suspicion that the dead man in the cargo container might be Thomas Chandonne , the brother , the killer 's brother , both of them sons of this Chandonne criminal cartel that half of law enforcement in the universe has been trying to bring down forever . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have returned the tattoo to the morgue ? " My head pounds . " Yes , I certainly should have . But I was distracted . I just forgot . " I almost snap at her . " You just forgot , " Officer Calloway repeats while Marino listens with gathering fury , trying to let her do her job and despising her at the same time . " Dr. Scarpetta , do you have other body parts in your house ? " Calloway then asks . A stabbing pain penetrates my right eye . I am getting a migraine . " What kind of fucking question is that ? " Marino raises his voice another decibel . " I just did n't want us walking in on anything else like body fluids or other chemicals or ... " " No , no . " I shake my head and turn my attention to a stack of neatly folded slacks and polo shirts . " Just slides . " " Slides ? " " For histology , " I vaguely explain . " For what ? " " Calloway , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gavel as he rises from the bed . " I just want to make sure we do n't need to worry about any other hazards , " she says to him , and her hot cheeks and the flash in her eyes belie her subordination . She hates Marino . A lot of people do . " The only hazard you got ta worry about is the one you 're looking at , " Marino snaps at her . " How bout giving the Doc a little privacy , a little reprieve from dumb-ass questions ? " Calloway is an unattractive chinless woman with thick hips and narrow shoulders , her body tense with anger and embarrassment . She spins around and walks out of my bedroom , her footsteps absorbed by the Persian runner in the hallway . " What 's she think ? You collect trophies or something ? " Marino says to me . " You bring home souvenirs like fucking Jeffrey Dahmer ? Jesus Christ . " " I ca n't take any more of this . " I tuck perfectly folded polo shirts into the tote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Doc . But you do n't have to take any more of it today . " He wearily sits back down on the foot of my bed . " Keep your detectives off me , " I warn him . " I do n't want to see another cop in my face . I 'm not the one who did something wrong . " " If they got anything else , they 'll run it through me . This is my investigation , even if people like Calloway ai n't figured that out yet . But I also ai n't the one you got to worry about . It 's like take anumber in the deli line , there 's so many people who insist they got to talk to you . " I stack slacks on top of the polo shirts , and then reverse the order , placing the shirts on top so they do n't wrinkle . " Course , nowhere near as many people as the ones who want to talk to him . " He means Chandonne . " All these profilers and forensic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Who 's Who list . I stop packing . I have no intention of picking through lingerie while Marino watches . I refuse to sort through toiletries with him witness to it all . " I need a few minutes alone , " I tell him . He stares at me , his eyes red , his face flushed the deep color of wine . Even his balding head is red , and he is disheveled in his jeans and a sweatshirt , his belly nine months pregnant , his Red Wing boots huge and dirty . I can see his mind working . He does n't want to leave me alone and seems to be weighing concerns that he will not share with me . A paranoid thought rises like dark smoke in my mind . He does n't trust me . Maybe he thinks I am suicidal . " Marino , please . Can you just stand outside and keep people away while I finish up in here ? Go to my car and get my crime scene case out of the trunk . If I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it . The key 's in the kitchen desk drawer , the top rightwhere I keep all my keys . Please . And I need my car , by the way . I guess I 'll just take my car and you can leave the scene case in it . " Confusion eddies . He hesitates . " You ca n't take your car . " " Damn it ! " I blurt out . " Do n't tell me they 've got to go through my car , too . This is insane . " " Look . The first time your alarm went off last night , it was because someone tried to break into your garage . " " What do you mean , someone ? " I retort as migraine pain sears my temples and blurs myvision . " We know exactly who . He forced my garage door open because he wanted the alarm togo off . He wanted the police to show up . So it would n't seem odd if the police came back a littlelater because a neighbor reported a prowler on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came back . He impersonated the police . I still ca n't believe I fell for it . " We ai n't got all the answers yet , " Marino replies . " Why is it I keep getting this feeling you do n't believe me ? " " You need to get to Anna 's and sleep . " " He did n't touch my car , " I assert . " He never got inside my garage . I do n't want anyone touching my car . I want to take it tonight . Just leave the scene case inside the trunk . " " Not tonight . " Marino walks out and shuts the door behind him . I am desperate for a drink to override the electrical spikes in my central nervous system , but what do I do ? Walk out to the bar and tell the cops to get the hell out of my way while I find the Scotch ? Knowing that liquor probably wo n't help my headache does n't have an impact . I am so miserable in my own skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for me right now . In the bathroom I dig through more drawers and spill several lipsticks on the floor . They roll between the toilet and the tub . I am unsteady as I bend over to retrieve them , groping awkwardly with my right arm , all of this made more difficult because I am left-handed . I stop to ponder the perfumes neatly arranged on the vanity and gently pick up the small gold metal bottle of Hermes 24 Faubourg . It is cool in my hand . I lift the spray nozzle to my nose and the spicy , erotic scent that Benton Wesley loved fills my eyes with tears and my heart feels as if it will fatally fly out of rhythm . I have not used the perfume in more than a year , not once since Benton was murdered . Now I have been murdered , I tell him in my throbbing mind . And I am still here , Benton , I am still here . You were a psychological profiler for the FBI , an expert in dissecting the psyches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen this coming , would n't you ? You would have predicted it , prevented it . Why were n't you here , Benton ? I would be all right if you had been here . I realize someone is knocking on my bedroom door . " Just a minute , " I call out , clearing my throat and wiping my eyes . I splash cold water on my face and tuck the Hermes perfume into the tote bag . I go to the door , expecting Marino . Instead , Jay Talley walks in wearing ATF battle dress and a day 's growth of beard that turns his dark beauty sinister . He is one of the handsomest men I have ever known , his body exquisitely sculpted , sensuality exuding from his pores like musk . " Just checking on you before you head out . " His eyes burn into mine . They seem to feel and explore me the way his hands and mouth did four days ago in France . " What can I tell you ? " I let him into my bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want him to see me like this . " I have to leave my own house . It 's almost Christmas . My arm hurts . My head hurts . Other than that , I 'm fine . " " I 'll drive you to Dr. Zenner 's . I would like to , Kay . " It vaguely penetrates that he knows where I am staying tonight . Marino promised my whereabouts would be secret . Jay shuts the door and takes my hand , and all I can think about is that he did n't wait at the hospital for me and now he wants to drive me someplace else . " Let me help you through this . I care about you , " he says to me . " No one seemed to care very much last night , " I reply as I recall that when he drove me home from the hospital and I thanked him for waiting , for being there for me , he never once even intimated that he had n't been there . " You and all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my front door , " I go on . " You fly all the way here from Paris to lead a goddamn International Response Team in your big-game hunt for this guy , and what a joke . What a bad movieall these big cops with all their gear and assault rifles and the monster just strolls right up to my house . " Jay 's eyes have begun wandering over areas of my anatomy as if they are rest stops he is entitled to revisit . It shocks and repulses me that he can think about my body at a time like this . In Paris I thought I was falling in love with him . As I stand here with him in my bedroom and he is openly interested in what is under my old lab coat , I realize I do n't love him in the least . " You 're just upset . God , why would n't you be ? I 'm concerned about you . I 'm here for you . " He tries to touch me and I move away . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , but now I mean it . " A few hours . An encounter , Jay . " " A mistake ? " Hurt sharpens his voice . Dark anger flashes in his eyes . " Do n't try to turn an afternoon into a life , into something of permanent meaning . It is n't there . I 'm sorry . For God 's sake . " My indignation rises . " Do n't want anything from me right now . " I walk away from him , gesturing with my one good arm . " What are you doing ? What the hell are you doing ? " He raises a hand and hangs his head , warding off my blows , acknowledging his mistake . I am not sure if he is sincere . " I do n't know what I 'm doing . Being stupid , that 's what , " he says . " I do n't mean to want anything . Stupid , I 'm stupid because of how I feel about you . Do n't hold it against me . Please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm here for you , Kay . Jet'aime . " I realize Jay has a way of saying goodbye that makes me feel I might never see him again . An atavistic panic thrills my deepest psyche and I resist the temptation to call after him , to apologize , to promise we will have dinner or drinks soon . I shut my eyes and rub my temples , briefly leaning against the bedpost . I tell myself I do n't know what I am doing right now and should not do anything . Marino is in the hallway , an unlit cigarette clamped in the corner of his mouth , and I can feel him trying to read me and what might have just happened while Jay was inside my bedroom with the door shut . My gaze lingers on the empty hallway , halfway hoping Jay will reappear and dreading it at the same time . Marino grabs my bags and cops fall silent as I approach . They avoid looking in my direction as they move about my great room , duty belts creaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs of the coffee table , the flash gun popping bright white . Someone else is videotaping while a crime scene technician sets up an alternative light source called a Luma-Lite that can detect fingerprints , drugs and body fluids not visible to the unaided eye . My downtown office has a Luma-Lite I routinely use on bodies at scenes and in the morgue . To see a Luma-Lite inside my house gives me a feeling that is indescribable . Dark dusting power smudges furniture and walls , and the colorful Persian rug is pulled back , exposing antique French oak underneath . An endtable lamp is unplugged and on the floor . The sectional sofa has craters where cushions used to be , the air oily and acrid with the residual odor of formalin . Off the great room and near the front door is the dining room and through the open doorway I am greeted with the sight of a brown paper bag sealed with yellow evidence tape , dated , initialed and labeled clothing Scarpetta . Inside it are the slacks , sweater , socks , shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me in the hospital . That bag and other evidence and flashlights and equipment are on top of my favorite red Jarrah Wood dining room table , as if it is a workbench . Cops have draped coats over chairs , and wet , dirty footprints are everywhere . My mouth is dry , my joints weak with shame and rage . " Yo Marino ! " a cop barks . " Righter 's looking for you . " Buford Righter is the city commonwealth 's attorney . I look around for Jay . He is nowhere to be seen . " Tell him to take a number and wait in line . " Marino sticks to his deli-line allusion . He lights the cigarette as I open the front door , and cold air bites my face and makes my eyes water . " Did you get my crime scene case ? " I ask him . " It 's in the truck . " He says this like a condescending husband who has been asked to fetch his wife 's pocketbook . " Why 's Righter calling ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyeurs , " he mutters . Marino 's truck is on the street out front and two massive tires have chewed tracks into my snowy churned-up lawn . Buford Righter and I have worked many cases together over the years and it stings that he did not ask me directly if he could come to my house . He has not , for that matter , contacted me to see how I am and let me know he is glad I am alive . " You ask me , people just want to see your joint , " Marino says . " So they give these excuses about needing to check this and that . " Slush seeps into my shoes as I carefully make my way along the driveway . " You got no idea how many people ask me what your house is like . You 'd think you was Lady Di or something . Plus , Righter 's got his nose in everything , ca n't stand to be left out of the loop . Biggest fucking case since Jack the Ripper . Righter 's bugging the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright white stutters and I almost slip . I swear out loud . Photographers have gotten past the neighborhood guard gate . Three of them hurry toward me in a blaze of flashes as I struggle with one arm to climb into the truck 's high front seat . " Hey ! " Marino yells at the nearest offender , a woman . " Goddamn bitch ! " He lunges , trying to block her camera , and her feet go out from under her . She sits down hard on the slick street , camera equipment thudding and scattering . " Fuckhead ! " she screams at him . " Fuckhead ! " " Get in the truck ! Get in the truck ! " Marino yells at me . " Motherfucker ! " My heart drills my ribs . " I 'm going to sue you , motherfucker ! " More flashes and I shut my coat in the door and have to open it again and shut it again while Marino shoves my bags in back and jumps into the driver 's seat , the engine turning over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up , and it occurs to me I ought to make sure she is n't injured . " We should see if she 's hurt , " I say , staring out the side window . " Hell no . Fuck no . " The truck lurches onto the street , fishtails and accelerates . " Who are they ? " Adrenalin pumps . Blue dots float before my eyes . " Assholes . That 's who . " He snatches up the hand mike . " Unit nine , " he announces over the air . " Unit nine , " the dispatcher comes back . " I do n't need pictures of me , my house ... , " I raise my voice . Every cell in my body lights up to protest the unfairness of it all . " Ten-five unit three-twenty , ask him to call me on my portable . " Marino holds the mike against his mouth . Unit three-twenty gets back to him right away , the portable phone vibrating like a huge insect . Marino flips it open and talks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photographers . I 'm thinking they parked somewhere in Windsor Farms , came in on foot over the fence , through that open grassy area behind the guard booth . Send units to look for any cars parked where they should n't be and tow ' em . They step foot on the Doc 's property , arrest ' em . " He ends the call , flipping the phone shut as if he is Captain Kirk and has just ordered the Enterprise to attack . We slow down at the guard booth and Joe steps out . He is an old man who has always been proud to wear his brown Pinkerton 's uniform , and he is very nice , polite and protective , but I would not want to depend on him or his colleagues for more than nuisance control . It should n't surprise me a bit that Chandonne got inside my neighborhood or that now the media has . Joe 's slack , wrinkled face turns uneasy when he notices me sitting inside the truck . " Hey , man , " Marino gruffly says through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here ? " " What ? " Joe instantly goes into protect mode , eyes narrowing as he stares down the slick , empty street , sodium vapor lights casting yellow auras high up on poles . " In front of the Doc 's house . At least three of ' em . " " They did n't come through here , " Joe declares . He ducks back inside the booth and grabs the phone . We drive off . " We can do but so much , Doc , " Marino says to me . " You may as well duck your head in the sand because there 's gon na be pictures and shit all over the place . " I stare out the window at lovely Georgian homes glowing with holiday festivity . " Bad news is , your security risk just went up another mile . " He is preaching to me , telling me what I already know and have no interest in dwelling on right now . " Because now half the world 's gon na see your big fancy house and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries the hell out of me , is stuff like this brings out other squirrels . Gives ' em ideas . They start imagining you as a victim and get off on it , like those assholes who go to the courthouse , cruising for rape cases to sit in on . " He eases to a stop at the intersection of Canterbury Road and West Cary Street , and headlights sweep over us as a compact dark-colored sedan turns in and slows . I recognize the narrow , insipid face of Buford Righter looking over at Marino 's truck . Righter and Marino roll down their windows . " You leaving ... ? " Righter starts to say when his eyes shoot past Marino and land on me in surprise . I have the unnerving sense that I am the last person he wants to see . " Sorry for your trouble , " Righter weirdly says to me , as if what is happening in my life is nothing more than trouble , an inconvenience , an unpleasantness . " Yeah , heading out . " Marino sucks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already expressed his opinion about Righter 's showing up at my house . It is unnecessary , and even if he truly thinks it is so important to eyeball the crime scene himself , why did n't he do it earlier when I was at the hospital ? Righter pulls his overcoat more tightly around his neck , light from street lamps glinting off his glasses . He nods and says to me , " Take care . Glad you 're okay , " deciding to acknowledge my so-called trouble . " This is real hard on all of us . " A thought catches before it is out in words . Whatever he was going to say next is gone , retracted , struck from the record . " I 'll be talking to you , " he promises Marino . Windows go up . We drive off . " Give me a cigarette , " I tell Marino . " I 'm assuming he did n't come to my house earlier today , " I then say . " Yeah , actually he did . About ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfiltered Lucky Strikes and flame spits out of a lighter he holds my way . Anger coils through my entrails , and the back of my neck is hot , the pressure in my head almost unbearable . Fear stirs inside me like a waking beast . I turn mean , punching in the lighter on the dash , ungraciously leaving Marino 's arm extended with the Bic lighter flaming . " Thanks for telling me , " I sharply reply . " You mind my asking who the hell else has been in my house ? And how many times ? And how long they stayed and what they touched ? " " Hey , do n't take it out on me , " he warns . I know the tone . He is about to lose his patience with me and my mess . We are like weather systems about to collide , and I do n't want that . The last thing I need right now is a war with Marino . I touch the tip of the cigarette to bright orange coils and inhale deeply , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes in flinty silence , and when I finally speak , I sound numb , my feverish brain glazing over like the streets , depression a heavy pain spreading along my ribs . " I know you 're just doing what has to be done . I appreciate it , " I force the words . " Even if I 'm not showing it . " " You do n't got to explain nothing . " He sucks on the cigarette , both of us shooting streams of smoke toward our partially open windows . " I know exactly what you feel , " he adds . " You could n't possibly . " Resentment seeps up my throat like bile . " I do n't even know . " " I understand a lot more than you give me credit for , " he says . " Someday you 'll see that , Doc . No way you can see shit right now , and I 'm telling you it ai n't gon na get no better in days and weeks to come . That 's the way it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you how many times I 've seen it , seen what happens to people when they 're victimized . " I absolutely do not want to hear a single word of this . " Damn good thing you 're going where you are , " he says . " Exactly what the doctor ordered , in more ways than one . " " I 'm not staying with Anna because it 's what the doctor ordered , " I reply testily . " I 'm staying with her because she 's my friend . " " Look , you 're a victim and you got to deal with it , and you need help dealing with it . Do n't matter you 're a doctor-lawyerIndian chief . " Marino will not shut up , in part because he is looking for a fight . He wants a focus for his anger . I can see what is coming , and anger crawls up my neck and heats up the roots of my hair . " Being a victim 's the great equalizer , " Marino , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words slowly . " I am not a victim . " My voice wavers around its edges like fire . " There 's a difference between being victimized and being a victim . I 'm not a sideshow forcharacter disorders . " My tone sears . " I have n't become what he wanted to turn me into " of course , I mean Chandonne " even if he 'd had his way , I would n't be what he tried to project onto me . I would just be dead . Not changed . Not something less than I am . Just dead . " I feel Marino recoil in his dark , loud space on the other side of his huge , manly truck . He does n't understand what I mean or feel and probably never will . He reacts as if I slapped him across the face or kneed him in the groin . " I 'm talking reality . " He strikes back . " One of us has to . " " Reality is , I 'm alive . " " Yeah . A fuckin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would do this . " I get quiet and cold . " So predictable . People blame the prey not the predator , criticize the injured not the asshole who did it . " I tremble in the dark . " Goddamn you . Goddamn you , Marino . " " I still ca n't believe you opened your door ! " he shouts . What happened to me makes him feel powerless . " And where were you guys ? " I again remind him of an unpleasant fact . " It might have been nice if at least one or two of you could have kept an eye on my property . Since you were so concerned that he might come after me . " " I talked to you on the phone , remember ? " He attacks from another angle . " You said you was fine . I told you to sit tight , that we 'd found where the son of a bitch was hiding , that we knew he was out somewhere , probably looking for another woman to beat and bite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc-tor Law Enforcement ? You open your fucking door when someone knocks ! At fucking midnight ! " I thought the person was the police . He said he was the police . " Why ? " Marino is yelling now , pounding the steering wheel like an out-of-control child . " Huh ? Why ? Goddamn it , tell me ! " We knew for days who the killer is , that he is the spiritual and physical freak Chandonne . We knew he is French and where his organized crime family lives in Paris . The person outside my door did not have even a hint of a French accent . Police . I did n't call the police , I said through the shut door . Ma'am , we 've gotten a call about a suspicious person on your property . Are you all right ? He had no accent . I never expected him to speak without an accent . It never occurred to me , not once . Were I to relive last night , it still would not occur to me . The police had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did n't seem the least bit suspicious that they would be back . I incorrectly assumed they were keeping a close eye on my property . It was so quick . I opened the door and the porch light was off and I smelled that dirty , wet animal smell in the deep , frigid night . " Yo ! Anybody home ? " Marino yells , poking my shoulder hard . " Do n't touch me ! " I come to with a start , and gasp and jerk away from him and the truck swerves . The ensuing silence turns the air heavy like water a hundred feet deep , and awful images swim back into my blackest thoughts . A forgotten ash is so long I ca n't steer it to the ashtray in time . I brush off my lap . " You can turn at Stonypoint Shopping Center , if you want , " I say to Marino . " It 's quicker . "                    @
