Sandcastles By Luanne Rice Random House Luanne Rice Prologue In Ireland It was the land of their ancestors , and Honor swore she could hear their voices crying in the wind . The storm had been building since morning , silver mist giving way to driving rain , gusts off the sea now blowing the hedges and trees almost horizontal . The stone walls that had seemed so magical when she 'd first arrived now seemed dark and menacing . From the plane yesterday morning , Honor had been awed by the green , by the emerald grass and hedgerows and trees . Her three daughters had gazed down , excited and hoping they could see their father 's sculpture from the sky . He had written them letters about Ireland , and about the West Cork farmhouse he had found for them to stay in , and how he 'd built his latest work on the very edge of a cliff overlooking the sea . They had fought to open the letters when they came , and be the one to read them out loud , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! " Regis , fourteen , had cried out , pointing at a crumbling castle . " No , it 's there ... " twelve-year-old Agnes had said , crowding her sister to point out the window . Square green fields ran along the coast , each dotted with tiny white farm buildings . Stone towers and ruined castles seemed to crown every high hill . " They all look like the pictures he sent , " Cecilia , just seven , had said . " Itdoes n't matter which house it is , as long as he 's in it . Right , Mom ? " " Right , sweetheart , " Honor had said , sounding so much calmer than she 'd felt . " It 'll be just like home , Mom , " Agnes had said , forehead pressed to the plane 's window . " A beach , and stone walls ... only now we 'll be on the other side of the Atlantic , instead of home in Black Hall . It 's like going across a mirror ... " " Look at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like our green fields of home , " Agnes had said , unconsciously echoing the lyrics of a song her aunt used to sing to her . " What 's the first thing you 're going to do when you see Daddy ? " Regis had asked , turning to peer at Honor . There was such a challenge in her daughter 's face -- almost as if she knew how troubled her mother felt . " She 's going to hug and kiss him , " Agnes said . " Right , Mom ? " " That 's what I 'm going to do , too ! " Cece said . " The first thing I 'm going to do , " Regis said , " is ask him to show me his sculpture . It 's his biggest one yet , and it 's right at the edge of the highest cliff , and I want to climb up on top and see if I can see America ! " " You ca n't see America across the Atlantic Ocean , can you , Mom ? " Cece asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , " Regis said . " Dad said he could see it , so why would n't I be able to ? " " Your father was speaking figuratively , " Honor said . " He meant he could see it in his mind , or his heart ... the dream of America that our ancestors had when they left Ireland . " " And Daddy 's still dreaming , " Cece said . Cece had counted the days till this trip . Agnes prayed for his safety . And Regis followed in his footsteps . Although she did n't want to be an artist , she did want to live life on the edge . Over the past year she had been delivered back to the Academy by the police twice -- once for diving off the train bridge into Devil 's Hole , and once for climbing to the top of the lighthouse to hang the Irish flag . Instead of being upset , John had gone straight to the lighthouse with his camera to take pictures before the Coast Guard could climb up to take the flag down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride , and by her way of making a statement -- regardless of risk . Almost like his sculptures ; he called them " sandcastles , " which called to mind gentle beaches , families building fragile towers in the sand at the water 's edge . But John 's installations were sharp , kinetic , made of rock and fallen trees , dangerous to build . Now , on this craggy headland in West Cork , the spiky top of his latest -- the bare , unadorned branches of a tree that had fallen somewhere , hauled here by John -- was visible over the next rise , at the edge of a cliff , ninety-foot granite walls that dropped straight into the churning sea . Honor stood at the bedroom window of the farmhouse he 'd rented , looking out . John came out of the shower to stand behind her , putting his arms around her and leaning into her . Their clothes lay in a heap beside the bed . Her sketchpad , abandoned yet again , sat on the desk . She had made a few drawings , but her heart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , his lips against her ear . He sounded tentative , as if he was n't sure how she 'd respond . " Nothing , " she said . " You 're the artist in the family . " Honor pressed against his body , wishing she could turn off her thoughts and give in again to the desire that overtook her every time she saw her husband . She wished he had n't asked about her drawing . She gazed down at the small pile of moonstones -- luminous , worn smooth by the waves at the foot of the cliff , a gift from John the minute she 'd stepped off the plane -- on the desk beside her sketchpad . She knew he 'd meant them as a peace offering , but her heart was reluctant to accept it . She felt turned inside out , frayed from the stress of trying to keep up with him . He turned her toward him , pulled her body against his , and kissed her . " The girls , " Honor said . " They 're sleeping , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to pull her back to bed . " I know , " Honor said , " They 're jet-lagged and exhausted from the excitement of being here , seeing you . " " But what about you ? " he asked , stroking her hair and kissing the side of her neck . He sounded so hopeful , as if he thought maybe this trip could stop what they both felt happening between them , stop what they had always had from slipping away forever . " You 're not tired ? " " Yes , me too , " she said , kissing him . She was beyond tired ; of wanting him to come home , of worrying that he 'd get hurt or killed working on his installations alone , of wishing he 'd understand how worn out she was by the demands of his art . At the same time , she was tired of being blocked . It was as if his intense inspiration had started killing the fire of her own . Even her drawings , such as they were , were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered out the window , but the structure was now obscured by today 's wild storm . He had taken them all to the cliff edge yesterday , when they 'd first arrived . He 'd shown them the ruins of an old castle , a lookout tower built a thousand years ago . Sheep grazed on the hillsides , impossibly steep , slanting down to the sea . The sheep roamed free , their curly white wool splashed with red or blue paint , identifying them for their owners . They grazed right at the base of John 's sculpture . It affected Honor deeply -- to see her husband 's work here in Ireland . They had dreamed of coming for so long -- ever since that day twenty five years ago when she , John , Bernie , and Tom had found the box in the stone wall . Honor knew that John had always felt a primal pull to be here , to try to connect with the timeless spirits of his family , as Bernie and Tom had done years earlier . In this green and ancient land , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an epiphany in earth and stone . His sculpture awed her , as his work often did -- she found it inspiring , disturbing , stunning , rather than beautiful . She knew the physical effort it took him to drag the tree trunks and branches here to the cliff 's edge , to raise them up and balance them against the wind , to haul rocks into the pile -- cutting his hands and forearms , bruising his knuckles . John had hands like a prize-fighter 's : scarred and swollen . Only , it had so often seemed to Honor , that the person he was most fighting was himself . The sculpture rose up from the land like a castle ; echoing the ruins just across the gap . It seemed to grow from the ground , as if it had been there forever , a witness to his family who had worked this land , farmed these fields , starved during the famine . He was descended from famine orphans , and as he and Honor and their daughters walked the property , she had to hold back tears to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John experienced now . He was an artist , through and through . He channeled powers from far beyond his own experience -- became one with the ghosts , and the bones , and the spirits that had suffered and died . That 's why he 'd come to Ireland alone -- to haunt the Cobh docks from which his family had emigrated , to drink in the pubs , and to build this monument to his Irish dead . His sister Bernie -- Sister Bernadette Ignatius -- was probably the only person who really understood him . Honor loved him , but she did n't get what drove him , and she was also a little scared of him . Not that he 'd ever hurt her or the girls , but that he 'd die in pursuit of his art . It wore her down , it did . She 'd felt exhausted yesterday , standing at the base of his huge , ambitious , soaring , reckless installation . How had the wind and the weight of his materials not carried him over the edge of the cliff ? How had the storm-scoured branches , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crushed him ? Alone on this headland , he would have never gotten help . " You did this alone , " she 'd said to him while the girls explored the headland . The sculpture rose above them -- in silhouette it had what she had failed to notice before , a cross set at the top , to mirror not the castle ruins , but Bernie 's chapel across the sea . " No , " he said . " I had some help . " " Who ? Did Tom fly over ? " " No , Tom 's too busy at the Academy , " John said . " This was a local guy , an Irishman I met ... " Something about the way he trailed off made Honor stop asking . Strange people were sometimes drawn to John because of his work . He unlocked the souls of all kinds of people -- there was something about the soaring , spiritual , seeking nature of what he did that spoke to the hurt and troubled . She shivered at the way John looked now , his lips tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was better off not knowing . " Have you taken the pictures yet ? " Honor asked . He shook his head -- was that sorrow , or regret ? He glanced around the headland , as if on guard against a threat . " What 's wrong ? " she asked , her skin crawling . He hesitated . She saw him peer at the sky , then at the sea , at low black clouds gathering along the horizon . And he decided to lie ; regarding the weather , it was true in its own way , but it obscured his real concern , so Honor would n't have to worry too . " I have n't gotten any decent shots yet , " he said . " The days have been too sunny , which is great , and makes me so glad that you and the girls got to see Ireland in the sun . But I need some shadows and rain , to get the atmosphere the piece needs . " His work was a two-part process ; he built sculptures from materials gathered entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature take the work apart again . The wind , or the sea , or a river , or gravity would destroy what he had done , but the photographs would last forever . Very few people actually saw his installations -- Honor and the girls , Bernie and Tom were among the people who did . But the world -- art lovers , environmentalists , and dreamers -- knew the photographs of John Sullivan . " Looks like you 're getting your wish , " she said , pointing at the dark clouds scudding along the horizon . " Maybe , " he said , hugging her . " Then we can go home . " It had struck her , almost bitterly , how tender he sounded . John was never in a hurry to get home ; he made a life of his work , and his family had to fit in around his trips and installations . But she also felt some hope -- he wanted to come home this time . She was n't begging him . She believed he knew how close they were to losing their marriage . He had called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep , showed them the stone walls , famine walls built during the 1840 's by his ancestors , starving to death and worked to the bone . He pointed at the maps he 'd brought from Connecticut , shown them how the walls corresponded with the ones built by his great-grandfather across the water , on the grounds of Star of the Sea . He told them that the cross on the top of his sculpture lined up perfectly with the one on the top of the Academy 's chapel . Agnes had wanted to walk on the walls , and Regis had wanted to climb the sculpture , all the way to the cross . Cece had clung to her mother , afraid the wind might blow her off the cliff -- even though the sun had been shining , brightening the green , making the blue sea gleam down below , as the wind , barely a whisper that morning , began to pick up . Honor had pulled Cece into a quiet hollow , sheltered from the stiff wind , and pulled her sketchpad from her jacket pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughing , she had sketched John 's sculpture . An artist herself , she had once been passionately inspired by John 's work -- and he by hers . But lately she had just felt daunted . Sketching his sculpture on what felt like the edge of the world , holding her youngest , she remembered some of the joy art had brought her . As John 's work had gained power , she had lost track of herself . Maybe she could turn that around .... Today Ireland 's gentle green was gone , washed away by sheets of cold rain . The fog was gray and constant . Instead of reinforcing her bleak mood , it made her feel happy to be safe and cozy with her family -- all together again . An east wind had whipped into a full gale , howling off the sea , blowing whitecaps into spume , churning up the dark bay . Honor felt as if they were on a peninsula at the end of forever . &lt; Continues ... Excerpted from Sandcastles by Luanne Rice Excerpted by permission .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
