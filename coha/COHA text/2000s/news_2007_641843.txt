<p> It was supposed to be a night of celebration , the culmination of eight years of bonding between an enigmatic , talented boy-turned-man and his unrelenting mentor . <p> As night fell , though , on Saturday , April 28 , in Jacksonville , Fla. , Marcus Thomas and Richard Burnoski were not in a party mood . There were no toasts to the first-rounder , just fulfilled worries . <p> " We shed a few tears together that night , " Burnoski said this week , remembering the hollow first day of the NFL draft when a card with Thomas ' name on it never reached the commissioner 's podium in New York . <p> " Marcus was the top defensive tackle on the board . We all knew that . Everyone knew that . But because of what he did , we knew he would n't be a top-10 pick like he should have been . But I thought he 'd go no later than the third round . There was no way he 'd last past the third round , even with all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only five or six defensive tackles drafted , but there were nine and some of those cats we never heard of . That night , I thought , ' Good Lord , Marcus may not get drafted at all . " ' <p> Burnoski , Thomas ' high school coach-turned- <p> agent , was n't alone in his dire draft assessment . <p> " I really thought my days of playing football were over , " Thomas said . " I really thought that was it . I thought I was done . " <p> Perhaps because of that type of honesty which Thomas has always conveyed , he was given another chance . The Broncos , famous for giving questioned characters a chance , finally ended Thomas ' lost weekend in the fourth round after trading a package , including a third-round pick next year to Minnesota , to take him at No. 121 . <p> The Broncos overlooked the fact that Thomas was kicked off the eventual national champion Florida Gators after repeatedly testing positive for marijuana and for attending a party in Orlando , a decision that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he missed curfews . The Broncos focused on the fact that Thomas - who wrote an open letter to Florida fans after his dismissal , apologizing for his actions - got counseling for his problem and that he passed drug tests 17 consecutive weeks before the draft . The weekly drug testing was Thomas ' idea . <p> " I got a call from Denver on the second day of the draft , and they wanted to know if I had learned my lesson , " Thomas said . " I said , ' Yes , sir . ' And I did . I realized that you have to live the right way or people are going to think you 're a bad person . I do n't want people to think I 'm a bad guy . " <p> While it 's early in his career , the Broncos do n't think Thomas is a bad guy on or off the field . Thomas , 22 , has done everything the team has asked off the field and has become a major part of the defensive line . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting lineup . <p> " Marcus has been very good , " coach Mike Shanahan said . " He 's been what we expected him to be . " <p> Long road traveled <p> " What a road it 's been , " said Thomas ' mother , Sheila Mote , from Jacksonville , where she lives . " What happened was a shock because , as a mother , I did n't think my son would get in trouble . But he did , and he learned from it , and really , I had no doubt he 'd fight through this and succeed . " <p> Mom had no doubts , but there were obstacles . After Thomas was dismissed from the team - Denver first-round pick and Florida teammate Jarvis Moss maintains that Thomas was the best player on the team - Thomas felt instant embarrassment and fell into what Burnoski called a " deep depression . " Burnoski remembers that the first thing Thomas said after his dismissal was that he felt bad for his mother . <p> Mote , who works for an insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's mementos in her office . Thomas said he has no relationship with his father . Growing up , he said , it was " just me and my mom . " <p> " All he was worried about was that people would tease his mother for him getting kicked off the team , " Burnoski said . " That really hurt him . She 's his lifeline . " <p> Restoring image <p> Once the sting of his dismissal wore off and reality hit , Burnoski and Thomas made it their mission to recapture his status as a draftable player . Thomas was considered a borderline first-round pick when he was thinking of leaving school after his junior season , but he said he returned to school to " win a championship . " <p> It became clear after Thomas was kicked off the team that his stock was falling . The 35-year-old Burnoski - who got into the agent game mostly because of his close bond with Thomas - had the player he first met in the eighth grade move into his young family 's home . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was n't easy . <p> " I had one team tell me they would n't touch Marcus with a 10-foot pole , " Burnoski said . " I told that team that their guards are going to need a 10-foot pole when Marcus knocks them on their butts . " <p> Burnoski said it hurt him that Thomas ' name was connected to suspended Tennessee cornerback Adam " Pacman " Jones as a bad character . <p> " There were kids in this draft that had assaulted police officers , beat up girls , were in drive-by shootings - and Marcus was the bad guy , " Burnoski said . " Look , marijuana is illegal and it was the wrong thing for him to do . But this is no thug . He was one of the best kids I 've ever coached . Until his senior year in college Marcus was a model student . . I 'm just glad Denver gave him this chance . " <p> Gators defensive coordinator Greg Mattison said he has kept tabs on Thomas mostly because " Marcus was a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made excuses for his issues . <p> He made a mistake and he paid a rough price for it , missing being part of the national championship team , " Mattison said . But life is all about coming back from mistakes , and Marcus has done that . He owned up to his problems , and he has made it through . I always knew Marcus was a tremendous kid deep inside .
