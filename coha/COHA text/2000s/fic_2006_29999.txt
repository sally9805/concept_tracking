1 My name is Elizabeth but no ones ever called me that . My father took one look at me when I was born and must have thought I had the face of someone dignified and sad like an old-fashioned queen or a dead person , but what I turned out like is plain , not much there to notice . Even my life so far has been plain . More Daisy than Elizabeth from the word go . But the summer I went to England to stay with my cousins everything changed . Part of that was because of the war , which supposedly changed lots of things , but I cant remember much about life before the war anyway so it does nt count in my book , which this is . Mostly everything changed because of Edmond . And so heres what happened . 2 Im coming off this plane , and Ill tell you why that is later , and landing at London airport and Im looking around for a middle-aged kind of woman who Ive seen in pictures whos my Aunt Penn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the type who would wear a big necklace and flat shoes , and maybe some kind of narrow dress in black or gray . But Im just guessing since the pictures only showed her face . Anyway , Im looking and looking and everyones leaving and theres no signal on my phone and Im thinking Oh great , Im going to be abandoned at the airport so thats two countries they do nt want me in , when I notice everyones gone except this kid who comes up to me and says You must be Daisy . And when I look relieved he does too and says Im Edmond . Hello Edmond , I said , nice to meet you , and I look at him hard to try to get a feel for what my new life with my cousins might be like . Now let me tell you what he looks like before I forget because its not exactly what youd expect from your average fourteen-year-old what with the CIGARETTE and hair that looked like he cut it himself with a hatchet in the dead of night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutt , you know the ones you see at the dog shelter who are kind of hopeful and sweet and put their nose straight into your hand when they meet you with a certain kind of dignity and you know from that second that youre going to take him home ? Well thats him . Only he took me home . Ill take your bag , he said , and even though he s about half a mile shorter than me and has arms about as thick as a dog leg , he grabs my bag , and I grab it back and say Wheres your mom , is she in the car ? And he smiles and takes a drag on his cigarette , which even though I know smoking kills and all that , I think is a little bit cool , but maybe all the kids in England smoke cigarettes ? I do nt say anything in case its a well-known fact that the smoking age in England is something like twelve and by making a big thing about it Ill end up looking like an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says Mum couldnt come to the airport cause shes working and its not worth anyones life to interrupt her while shes working , and everyone else seemed to be somewhere else , so I drove here myself . I looked at him funny then . You drove here yourself ? You DROVE HERE yourself ? Yeah well and IM the Duchess of Panamas Private Secretary . And then he gave a little shrug and a little dog-shelter-dog kind of tilt of his head and he pointed at a falling-apart black jeep and he opened the door by reaching in through the window which was open , and pulling the handle up and yanking . He threw my bag in the back , though more like pushed it in , because it was pretty heavy , and then said Get in Cousin Daisy , and there was nothing else I could think of to do so I got in . Im still trying to get my head around all this when instead of following the signs that say Exit he turns the car up onto this grass and then drives across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he Enters and then he jogs left across a ditch and suddenly were out on the highway . Can you believe they charge 13.50 just to park there for an hour ? he says to me . Well to be fair , there is no way Im believing any of this , being driven along on the wrong side of the road by this skinny kid dragging on a cigarette and lets face it who wouldnt be thinking what a weird place England is . And then he looked at me again in his funny doggy way , and he said Youll get used to it . Which was strange too , because I had nt said anything out loud .
