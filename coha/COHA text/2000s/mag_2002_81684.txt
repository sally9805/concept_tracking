You knew it had to happen : Mark Cuban has gone Hollywood . The Mavericks ' owner has partnered with fellow Internet tycoon Todd Wagner to form a movie production company called 2929 Productions . Their first project , a quirky documentary called Searching for Debra Winger , was directed by actress Rosanna Arquette and recently premiered at the Cannes Film Festival . " Rosanna interviewed actresses talking about the challenges they face from Hollywood as they age , " says Cuban , " not only from trying to find roles in an industry where youth rules , but also in balancing family , friends and careers . " Appearing in the film are stars such as Meg Ryan , Holly Hunter , Frances McDormand and Daryl Hannah . The final interview is with Winger , who dropped out of the industry for several years after getting fed up with Hollywood . " I spent some time with Rosanna while she was filming it , and I 'm proud of what she 's been able to accomplish , " says Cuban , who notes that despite his executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner in 2929 .

Affleck , a die-hard Sox fan , took over the mike and did some shaky play-by-play for nearly six innings . Along the way he criticized outfielder Trot Nixon 's inability to hit lefthanders and also dissed Boston infielder Lou Merloni for saying earlier in the season that the team had " made a mockery of my career " by repeatedly sending him to the minors . " He absolutely sucks , " said Nixon afterward . " Matt Damon made you what you are , slick .

Tire book consists of wacky notes sent by Nancy to various businesses , which then sent back unintentionally hilarious responses . Sports letters are prominent , including the one Nancy sent the Lakers asking if it would be O.K. to attend a game wearing pants with a see-through bottom for medical reasons . " The only time you will see my cellophane exposed buttocks will be during the time I enter and exit the arena and during behind the back passes and 3 point buzzer shots , " writes Nancy .
