" I said it would be simple , " Lars Fuchs repeated . " I did not say it would be easy . " George AmbroseBig George to everyone who knew himscratched absently at his thick red beard as he gazed thoughtfully out through the window of Starpower 1 's bridge toward the immense looming dark bulk of the asteroid Ceres . " I di' n't come out here to get involved in daft schemes , Lars , " he said . His voice was surprisingly high and sweet for such a shaggy mastodon of a man . For a long moment the only sound in the compartment was the eternal hum of electrical equipment . Then Fuchs pushed between the two pilots ' seats to drift toward Big George . Stopping himself with a touch of his hand against the metal overhead , he said in an urgent whisper , " We can do it . Given time and resources . " " It 's fookin ' insane , " George muttered . But he kept staring out at the asteroid 's rock-strewn , pockmarked surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aussie with his shaggy brick-red mane and beard hovering weightlessly beside the dark , intense , thickset Fuchs . Three years in the Belt had changed Fuchs somewhat : he was still burly , barrel-chested , but he had let his chestnut brown hair grow almost to his collar , and the earring he wore was now a polished chip of asteroidal copper . A slim bracelet of copper circled his left wrist . Yet in their individual ways , both men looked powerful , determined , even dangerous . " Living inside Ceres is bad for our health , " Fuchs said . George countered , " Plenty of radiation protection from the rock . " " It 's themicrogravity , " Fuchs said earnestly . " It 's not good for us , physically . " " I like it . " " But the bones become so brittle . Dr. Cardenas says the rate of fractures is rising steeply . You 've seen that yourself , have n't you ? " " Maybe , " George half-admitted . Then he grinned . " But th ' sex is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " Be serious , George . " Without taking his eyes off Ceres ' battered face , George said , " Okay , you 're right . I know it . But buildin ' a bloody O'Neill habitat ? " " It does n't have to be that big , not like the L-5 habitats around Earth . Just big enough to house the few hundred people here in Ceres . At first . " George shook his shaggy head . " You know how big a job you 're talkin ' about ? Just the life support equipment alone would cost a mint . And then some . " " No , no . That 's the beauty of my scheme , " Fuchs said , with a nervous laugh . " We simply purchase spacecraft and put them together . They become the habitat . And they already have all the life support equipment and radiation shielding built into them . We wo n't need their propulsion units at all , so the price will be much lower than you think . " " Then you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g ? " " Lunar normal , " Fuchs answered . " One-sixth g is good enough . Dr. Cardenas agrees . " George scratched at his thick , unkempt beard . " I du n no , Lars . We 've been livin ' inside the rock okay . Why go to all this trouble and expense ? " " Because we have to ! " Fuchs insisted . " Living in micro-gravity is dangerous to our health . We must build a better habitat for ourselves . " George looked unconvinced , but he muttered , " Lunar g , you say ? " " One-sixth normal Earth gravity . No more than that . " " How much will it cost ? " Fuchs blinked once . " We can buy the stripped-down spacecraft from Astro Corporation . Pancho is offering a very good price . " " How much ? " " The preliminary figures work out . . . " Fuchs hesitated , took a breath , then said , " We can do it if all the prospectors and miners put in ten percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? " " Ten percent is n't much . " " A lot of us rock rats do n't make any income at all , some years . " " I know , " said Fuchs . " I factored that into the cost estimate . Of course , we 'll have to pay off the spacecraft over twenty or thirty-year leases . Like a mortgage on a house , Earthside . " " So you want everybody here in Ceres to take on a twenty-year debt ? " " We can pay it off sooner , perhaps . A few really big strikes could pay for the entire project all by themselves . " " Yeah . Sure . " With burning intensity , Fuchs asked , " Will you do it ? If you agree , most of the other prospectors will , too . " " Why n't you get one of the corporations t ' do it ? " George asked . " Astro or Humphries . . . " He stopped when he saw the look on Fuchs ' face . " Not Humphries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . Never . " " Okay . Astro , then . " Fuchs ' scowl shifted into a troubled frown . " I 've spoken to Pancho about it . The Astro board would not vote for it . They will sell stripped-down spacecraft to us , but they wo n't commit to building the habitat . They do n't see a profit from it . " George grunted . " Lot they care if we snap our bones . " " But you care , " Fuchs said eagerly . " It 's our problem , George ; we have to solve it . And we can , if you 'll help . " Running a beefy hand through his thick mop of red hair , Big George said , " You 're gon na need a teckie team to do the integration job . There 's more to puttin ' this habitat of yours together than just connectin ' tinkertoys , y'know . You 'll need a flock of geek boys . " " That 's already in the cost estimate , " Fuchs replied . George huffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lars , I 'm in . I guess it would be pretty good to have a base out here in the Belt with some decent gravity to it . " Fuchs smiled . " You can always have sex aboard your own ship . " George grinned back at him . " Believe it , mate . Believe it . " Fuchs went with George to the ship 's main airlock and helped the bigger man get back into his hard-shell spacesuit . " They 're testin ' lightweight suits back at Selene , y'know , " he said as he slid into the rigid torso and worked his arms through the stiff sleeves . " Flexible . Easy to put on . " " And the radiation protection ? " Fuchs asked . " Magnetic field surrounds the suit . They claim it 's better'n this stuff . " He rapped his knuckles against the torso 's cermet carapace . Fuchs gave a little snort of disdain . " They 'll need years of testing before I 'd buy one . " As he wormed his hands into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handing the bigger man his fishbowl helmet , Fuchs said , " Thanks for agreeing , George , " he said . " It means a lot to me . " George nodded solemnly . " I know . You two want to have kids . " Fuchs ' cheeks reddened . " It 's not that ! " " Is n't it ? " " Well , not alone , no . " Fuchs looked away from George for a moment , then slowly admitted , " I worry about Amanda , yes . I never thought she would want to stay out here with me . I never thought I myself would be out here this long . " " There 's a lot of money to be made here in the Belt . A lot of money . " " Yes , yes indeed . But I worry about her . I want her to be in a safer place , with enough gravity to keep her from de-conditioning . " " And enough radiation shielding to start a family , " George said , grinning .
