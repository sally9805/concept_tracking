<p> DALLAS  --  The helipad atop the swank , 33-story W Hotel offers a panoramic view of Victory Park . Ross Perot Jr. , his helicopter nearby , proudly points to glimmering high-rise condominiums , luxury hotels , office buildings and giant cranes poised to build more on 275 acres of former wasteland . <p> " This is a part of Dallas that had been forgotten , " says Perot , one of Texas ' top residential and commercial real estate developers and the leader of a $3-billion-plus effort to create a massive downtown district from scratch . <p> The son and namesake of a billionaire two-time presidential candidate , Perot is convinced that without residential and entertainment choices in a dense urban setting reminiscent of New York or Chicago , Dallas risks losing its business edge . <p> " Our offices want this kind of neighborhood , " he says . " It 's good for recruiting . " <p> High-rise urban living in Texas ? <p> This is the largest state in the contiguous USA , stretching more than 700miles from east to west and north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living large  --  and spread out  --  has n't been just a choice but almost a birthright . <p> However , Perot 's development  --  and similar plans by other developers in Austin , Fort Worth , Houston and San Antonio  --  have put Texas on the front lines of a movement reshaping downtowns across the USA . <p> What changed here ? <p> Gas prices soared . Traffic congestion choked highways . Air quality worsened and so did pressure from environmental regulators . Light-rail lines came online . And demographics shifted : As baby boomers became empty nesters , their desire for convenience and fun suddenly merged with those of young professionals . Both groups are flocking to urban settings . <p> " People are tired of the big house , they 're tired of the big yard , and there 's a real movement to simplify your lifestyle as children leave , " Perot says . " You can move into a beautiful downtown home , walk to the arts , walk to a basketball game , walk to restaurants . There is something unique in the downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Texas now is home to three of the nation 's 10 most populous cities ( Houston , Dallas , San Antonio ) . Its population continues to grow at phenomenal rates : It added 4 million people in the 1990s and more than 2.5 million so far this decade to top 23.5 million , second only to California . <p> As people pour in , the state is starting to rein in its historical outward spread and venturing into un-Texan territory : high-density development , downtown living , mass transit and neighborhoods built not just for cars , but for walkers and all things urban . <p> " The competitive advantage of the six or 10 ' real ' cities in the country is that they offered unrivaled urban living , " says Robert Lang , director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech . " What you have now is a much larger number of places where you can live an urban lifestyle . <p> " More and more cities see their built form as part of the sale , part of the calculus , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strip malls , you 're toast . There 's a big part of the workforce that just wo n't tolerate that anymore . " <p> Texas is rapidly learning that lesson . Its cities are growing up  --  literally . High-rises , multilevel apartment and condominium buildings are rising in downtowns , on old industrial sites and in abandoned neighborhoods . <p> The success of light rail in Dallas in particular has spawned developments mixing condos , offices and shops around transit stops in the city and suburbs such as Plano . <p> If there are any doubts that living in the city has undergone a 180-degree image transformation , consider the marketing pitch for The Vista , a seven-story , 129-unit residential building with street-level retail at Victory Park : " An exciting rental opportunity for the inner-city dweller . " <p> Inner-city ? That word alone would have had people running for the suburbs a decade ago . <p> When Anthony Flint of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge , Mass. , traveled across the country to research his book , This Land : The Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went looking for sprawl and urbanism , " he says . He found both in Texas . <p> " It was a little counterintuitive , " Flint says . <p> " This is Texas , the land of wide-open spaces . I found examples of urbanism . " <p> Revamping cityscapes <p> Meet the new urban Texas : <p> *Austin has doubled its population every 20 years ( 709,893 in 2006 ) since it was founded in 1839 . Much of that time , Texas ' capital city has grown away from downtown . Now , the focus is on increasing the population density downtown by building upward . <p> " At least four towers are going up right now , " says Fritz Steiner , dean of the architecture school at the University of Texas-Austin . " It 's pretty dramatic . All around the edges of downtown or central area , one sees , if not high-rises , other apartments and condominium projects . " <p> Like Dallas ' Victory Park , the Block 21 development in Austin will have a W Hotel . Shops and restaurants will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32-mile commuter rail line will run from downtown Austin to Leander , a town to the northwest . Several residential-retail developments built around transit stops are being planned . The old municipal airport close to downtown is being developed into shops , parks , bike trails , offices , a medical center and residences , including some units for low-income families . An area west of the university has been rezoned to encourage greater density . <p> *In Fort Worth , where the billionaire Bass family has spurred development of the arts and loft projects downtown , Trinity River View is a proposed 800-acre complex of schools , parks , housing and shops that could add 25,000 residents . <p> *In Houston , there are plans for Discovery Green , a 12-acre park next to the downtown convention center . A 37-story condo tower will rise beside it . Warehouses and factories are being converted to housing . A light-rail line from downtown is sparking development . <p> *San Antonio 's signature River Walk will add another 1 1/2 miles to link major museums by the end of next year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The movement also is accelerating beyond Texas . Phoenix , Las Vegas and several other cities that do n't have a rich urban heritage are embracing high-density projects . <p> Phoenix is building a light-rail system to connect with suburbs . Cities along the rail line that 's scheduled to open next year are rezoning around transit stations to encourage urban development . <p> High-rises are n't new to Vegas , but they 're getting bigger and taller and are more than just hotels and casinos . On the north end of the Strip , the 76-acre Project CityCenter by MGM-Mirage is a city within a city . Downtown , a complex that will include a transportation terminal , city offices and other commercial development are planned . <p> " It 's a new culture for us in southern Nevada , " says Debra March , director of the Lied Institute for Real Estate Studies at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas . " East Coast cities have had that higher-density flavor for some time . For us , it 's a new experience . " <p> Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from New York or New Jersey , March notes . There , she adds , " they 've been accustomed to high-rise development ... as a lifestyle choice . " <p> Looking up in Dallas <p> It should come as no surprise that Texas ' new passion for drawing people downtown is playing out in a big way in " Big D. " <p> Dallas did not experience the dizzying real estate boom that other parts of the USA saw earlier this decade . That has spared it the freefalls in prices and sales that have staggered other areas . <p> Last year , the city adopted its first growth plan that details a long-term vision . The theme of Forward Dallas ! is clear : density , density , density . <p> Dense development is clustering along the 45-mile Dallas Area Rapid Transit light-rail line that connects Dallas and Plano to the north and Garland to the northeast . Construction is underway to almost double the system . By 2013 , Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Love Field , the major airports serving the city , will be linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 study by professors at the University of North Texas in Denton estimated that more than $3.3 billion had been invested or planned near light-rail stations since 1999 . <p> " About five years ago , I could count maybe two developers who sort of had an idea what transit-oriented development was about , " says Peer Chacko , assistant director of Dallas ' long-range planning division . " All this has changed . " <p> Only two developers applied for public funding for such development four years ago , he says . More than 50 applied last year . <p> " These ideas are not usually associated with Texas , " Chacko says . " Density is still in many communities considered a bad word . Public housing is associated with it . " <p> Upscale and elevated <p> Victory Park is as far from public housing as you can get . It 's anchored by the American Airlines Center , which opened in 2001 as the home of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , a team partly owned by Perot . " New cities were not developed originally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillwood development company . " Dallas grew in a traditional suburban program because land was cheap . " <p> Perot owned land all around the arena . He used it to create a glitzy neighborhood from an industrial wasteland . Power plants , fuel storage tanks , a railroad maintenance yard and incinerators had left cancer-causing substances behind . <p> About 15 million gallons of tainted groundwater had to be cleaned and 750,000 cubic yards of dirt moved . <p> Perot wanted a community where " you basically can live , work and play , " he says . <p> Victory Park is wooing largely high-end residents . The W Dallas Victory Hotel &; Residences are selling for $400,000 to $7 million . Other projects include The House , a 28-story , 147-unit residential tower designed by renowned French designer Philippe Starck . And Victory Tower , 43 stories featuring the Mandarin Oriental Hotel , 90 residential units , office and retail space . And Cirque , a 28-story high-rise with 252 apartments . <p> Whatever the model , Cathy Phillips is ecstatic about the transformation as she browses through Haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that line Victory Park Lane in the shadow of high-rises . <p> " I love the feel of it , " says Phillips , a fundraising activist who splits her time between Dallas and California . <p> Jon Tutolo , Haven 's owner , has clients who live part time in other cities or abroad . The growing cosmopolitan nature of its population may help explain Dallas ' embrace of urbanism . <p> Northern cities provide much of the inspiration for Dallas ' upward mobility , but they 're not publicly touted as the role models . <p> " In secret , we look at what they do , " Dallas city planner Chacko says . " But we try to avoid pointing to them too much as an example . It does n't sell very well to the public . If we say New York or Chicago , they say , ' We 're Dallas . ' There 's a very strong level of pride . " <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document . Select terms of interest and either modify your @ @ @ @ @ @ @
