It 's hard to stop looking for something without simultaneously giving up hope . I do n't know how . Buddhists learn the art of nonattachment , or they say they do . But have you ever seen a Buddhist lose his car keys ? I have , and they 're just like the rest of us . Now that I was in my thirties , being single was entirely different . It meant candid discussions with a date , both of us saying , " Naaaaah ... " but friendly-like . It meant peeling singles out of my wallet , splitting the tab exactly down the middle . I 'd forgotten all my exit lines . I 'd lost that Good Morning Vietnam feeling . I just wanted a little peace . <p> Two things told me I was getting older : last Christmas , three people gave me tree ornaments . And second , when my friends described the men they wanted me to meet , they listed their qualities . " He 's an individualist , losing his hair but in a good way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like shopping , shopping blind . It used to be that we all went out , drank a jug of wine , and woke up the next morning to see what had happened in the night . These days , you go on a date with a pen and notepad . They 're job interviews . <p> " That 's why I believe dates should be conducted in a formal office setting , " said my friend Jack . <p> Should n't it feel natural , spontaneous , like falling out of a tree ? <p> Other people think I 've made a mess out of my life , but I disagree . I think that I 've just been efficient . I 've managed to cram a lifetime of mistakes into a span of ten years . I 'm still young , thirtytwo , and I 'm watching other people take their time with it , sticking with husbands or wives who wo n't have sex with them , wo n't clean up after themselves , whatever . I had done all that . Somewhere along the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I wanted a mail-order prince . Either that , or nothing . <p> " Here I am , baby " Jack said , thumping himself on the chest . " Prince Charming . ' <p> " Prince Alarming , ' I said . <p> Every time I went on a first date , the next morning I bought a ten-cent feeder goldfish from the pet store and put it in a giant jar that used to hold pickles . I named the fish after my date . I did n't give him any advantages . Instead of distilled water , I used tap water-over-chlorinated , radioactive . I did not change this water . I did not feed the fish . If my date called and the goldfish was still alive , I went out with him again . If the goldfish died before he called , I gave up on him . <p> " It 's Darwinian , " I explained to Jack . <p> Jack said , " That 's totally crazy . " <p> I said , " When it comes to dating , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sane person would go crazy . " <p> " Jesus . Feed it , at least . " <p> My instincts are always wrong , but I follow them , anyway . I read somewhere that you can find your way out of any maze by touching the wall with your right hand and following that hand wherever it leads . Eventually it will lead out into the open air , even if it takes a million billion years . <p> Jack said I was just looking for someone whose metaphors matched mine . He said I should give up , I 'll never find that , because my metaphors are stupid . <p> I suspect that my problem is this : I have never been able to tell the difference between longing and love . This , Jack says , is my dysfunction . <p> " There is no difference , " he says . <p> Jack and I went to the gym and got on stationary bikes . Jack said , " This is ridiculous . A stationary bike ? " <p> " It 's cold out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd rather freeze , " he panted . But he kept pedaling next to me . <p> I met Jack five years ago at a party . He got down on a knee and said , " If I do n't take you home tonight , I 'll never recover . " But the way he said it , looking over my shoulder and nodding at someone he knew , told me that he had said this before , maybe as recently as last night , and he had recovered quite well , considering . <p> Jack is thirty-five . Jack is attractive . But I say that grudgingly , because with Jack , you do . He has dark brown eyes and they change expression so rapidly , talking with him is like watching television . It 's like watching television , anyway . <p> When he was sixteen , Jack lost his twin sister in a party-related drug incident-he wo n't discuss the details . She had an extreme allergic reaction and died . Jack spent the next three years at home in Tucson comforting his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again , not even for Christmas , which he spends with my family each year . My family adores him . They think it 's cute when he says grace at the table , and we all humor him , shouting " Amen " or " Hallelujah " afterward . <p> Unlike me , Jack had a religious upbringing . He and his twin sister were forced to take two hours of religion classes every day in school , K through twelve . One day , Jack 's third-grade teacher spotted him daydreaming and asked , " Jack , why do we worship Jesus ? Why do n't we worship , say , you ? " Startled , Jack said , " Not enough people know me yet . " <p> Enough people know him now , but I 'm his only follower . Jack and I had settled into a friendship over the last five years that had flowed seamlessly out of his come-ons . Every now and then he threw out another one , but I handled them like dents in my windshield , swerving my head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian , always calling to record every little event in our lives : that our ficus plant was n't doing well , or that the guy at the gas station had shortchanged us by five dollars . Sometimes I got confused and forgot what I had told Jack versus what I planned to tell Jack , and it took us some time to iron out those details . <p> At the very least , it was nice to have a compatriot . There at the gym , I slid over a retro seventies postcard I had just bought next door . It vibrated on Jack 's machine . It was a picture of a smiling blond woman curled up on a couch , watching her date croon a love song to her , his open mouth wide . In a cartoon bubble over her head , the woman is thinking : " The good times are killing me . ' Jack laughed , pedaling faster . <p> I told him about the date that had inspired the purchase . I had gone out the night before with a man who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very spiritual . " <p> " So I said , " I 'm not at all spiritual , but I 'm deeply religious . " <p> He asked , " What religion ? " <p> " Oh , you know , " I said , waving my hand . " Any of ' em . " <p> " I see we have some differences , " he said . <p> There at the gym , Jack explained . " He was just trying too hard , that 's all . " <p> " Oh . " <p> Jack told me about his last date , a woman who described every other man she was currently seeing , in tortuous detail . She knew how much money each man made . She asked Jack , and then repeated the number back to him to make sure she had gotten it right . <p> Jack had met her at a dance club where she had written her phone number on his stomach in red lipstick . He sweated too much at the club and by the time he got home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he reached her . She did n't remember who he was , and it took him an hour of all his funniest jokes to convince her to go out with him . He said that the date had gone so poorly because he had used up his best material on the phone . . <p> My legs hurt . I looked at the exercise machine , unable to decipher it . " Help me with this thing ! <p> Jack leaned over and punched some buttons . A drop of sweat fell from his forehead onto the panel . The pedals got looser . I stared at the sweat shimmying on the plastic as I said , " I do n't know why you 're even bothering with her . " <p> " Because she does n't want me . Once she changes her mind , I can leave her alone . " He wiped his forehead with his arm and glanced at me . <p> " You always go after unavailable people : ' <p> " If the available people were all that great , they 'd be unavailable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes it is . " <p> " I refuse to live in your Tom Cruise world , " I said . <p> But was he was right ? Do n't you live in the world you 're stuck with ? I mean , I never wanted to live through two Bush presidencies , but here I was , saying it again : President Bush . And here we were , Jack and I in T-shirts , pushing some pedals around . That night , we 'd each go on a different date . We 'd call each other the next day and complain about it . He 'd tell me something like how , during sex ( and there would be sex ) , his date said , " Hup two three four .. " and I 'd tell Jack something like how my date said he was only interested in women who could ski . <p> When do the stories end ? Is that why people get married , and why married people are so boring ? Because you marry the guy who will give you no stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stories ? <p> Jack created a " Chicks I 've Nailed " database . When he disclosed this information over lunch , I said , " Never tell this to another woman . <p> He said , " Eleanor . It 's a wonderful introspective tool . For example : although I say I like hippie chicks , the plurality of girls I 've slept with have been artsy types . " <p> " Oh my God . " <p> " I 'm just trying to figure out what I 'm doing wrong . I printed out a pie chart ... ' He started groping in his bag . <p> " No . Put it away . " <p> " But- " <p> " No . " <p> Jack was working a new job doing sales and marketing in the building next to mine downtown . He said that he had taken a two-thousand-dollar pay cut for the convenience of seeing me . Of course , I did n't believe this , but we did have lunch almost every day , like now . I picked up my sandwich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of his mouth while he talked . <p> " This is what I 'm so sick of hearing : ' I really like you , Jack , you 're a great guy , Jack . But I just do n't feel that spark with you : " " Oh . Nice guy syndrome . " But he was n't a nice guy , so I did n't get it . <p> Jack put down his sandwich without biting into it . " I want to figure out this ' spark ' thing . And control it . " <p> " Do n't you think you 're missing the point ? " <p> " I want to gently open my hand and see a little flame in the center of my palm , dancing . " He stared at his hand . <p> " On the prowl again , " I said . <p> " That sounds a little more ... real than I 'd like it to , " Jack said , finally eating , mouth full . " I 'm on a mission . I have a list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , with phone numbers next to them . Some had question marks instead of last names . One woman he simply called " Satellite Girl . " He kept the piece of paper on the table while he talked , explaining that he had finally , seriously considered what he wants , and who fits the image . He wants the big , big love , composed out of an aggregate of characteristics . I peeked . Halfway down the list , I saw my own name . <p> I had a big love , once-Richard . The way it started was this : I had met Richard at a bar and was instantly smitten , but he did n't notice me . One day Richard called for my roommate Pete , who was n't home . When I answered the phone I was lying on my bed , playing with a stone a geologist friend had given to me . She had explained , " See the shiny parts ? See how it 's kind of oily-looking , chipped in weird places ? Long ago , a dinosaur ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones to help digest its food . " Sometimes I tried to put it in my own mouth , but it was too big . <p> When I knew Richard was about to hang up I said , " You 'll never in a billion years guess what I have in my hand . ' <p> Richard paused then bit , asking questions . Is it old , new , pretty , ugly , what color , what shape ? When I finally told him , he asked me out . We were in love for three years , and then he fell out of love abruptly and left me for a woman who makes bagels . <p> Despite all that , maybe that 's what love is , after all-holding out your hand and saying , Here . I 'm holding this small , simple thing , as old as time itself Do you want it ? Is this what you want ? <p> Now Jack asked me what I wanted , pen poised over an old receipt . <p> " It depends " I stalled . <p> " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Any personal habits you ca n't stand ? " <p> All I could think to say was that I did n't want a man who picked up his plate in restaurants and licked it . Not like last time . Jack wrote , " No plate-lickers . " He stared at the paper for a minute and then said , " Well . I think we can find you something . " <p> We both looked up suddenly . The woman at the table next to us had just started crying . " Michael ... that 's ... so ... , " she said , her cheeks turning red and wet . " I tell you I have feelings for you and you just laugh at me like that I ca n't believe you made me say that stuff out loud when you do n't care about me I feel sick I 'm going home . " <p> Her chair screeched back , and she rushed away , shoving her arms into her jacket sleeves . The man , Michael , stood up , threw money on the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Ellen did not wait . She pushed her way toward the door . <p> Then , in a voice probably meant to be just loud enough , but overcompensating at the last minute when he realized that he was losing her forever , Michael boomed : " STOP ! ELLEN ! I LOVE YOU ! TOO ! " <p> Ellen stopped and turned around . They stared at each other across the room . Nobody moved . The place fell silent . Even the music stopped , stuck between songs . <p> Someone called out , " Kiss her ! " <p> Michael walked over to Ellen . She looked up at him . The music began again , an accordion winding through the melody . A voice sang in another language . <p> They kissed . <p> People cheered . <p> Michael and Ellen kept on kissing , as if they were alone , as if the world were whirling around them in a hurricane , and they were caught right in the middle of its beautiful blue eye . Then they walked toward the doors , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extraordinary beginning of something ordinary . Or maybe the other way around , I do n't know . Strangers smiled at each other . A little boy started laughing . A woman reached across the table to hold her husband 's hand . <p> Jack and I stared at each other , then at the lists fluttering on the table as the double doors opened and closed . <p> I had to drive down to Colorado Springs for a meeting . On the drive back I was hit with a freak spring blizzard , almost a whiteout . Peering through the shooting snow , I saw a solid black billboard on the highway with giant words in white : " WHO 'S THE FATHER ? " Sponsored by an adoption agency . I wondered how many pregnant women drove down this highway , suddenly snapped their fingers , and said , " Come to think of it , who is the father , anyway ? " <p> Waiting for Jack that night , I threw part of a leftover bagel into my new goldfish 's jar . It sank slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> It was still snowing when Jack drove me to a party at his friend 's house . In the parking lot , he combed his hair with the brush end of the ice scraper before we went inside . <p> We took off our coats in the hallway . Jack looked at my outfit and made a cat noise , deep in his throat . I did n't know men could make cat noises . <p> " Nice skirt . " <p> It was tight , made out of old neckties sewn together . I said , " Thank you . " <p> Jack ushered me inside , saying , " I need a girl exactly like you . Except maybe with lower standards . " <p> " How about her ? " I asked , pointing with my head at a girl in a silver tank-top and a gold miniskirt . I could remember times when I felt that desperate . The girl was smiling at Jack . He said , " She 's a sparkly . " <p> " She 's pretty . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified that nobody would talk to her all evening . She held a glass of wine by the stem with one hand and caressed the rim with the other . She meant to be suggestive , I 'm sure , but instead it was just vulgar . I wanted to wrap her in a big fireman 's raincoat . " She seems nice , Jack " I said . <p> Jack moved so close to me , I could smell his soap . I looked at his left shoulder as he whispered above my ear , " I do n't like her , um , breasts . <p> " What ? " <p> " They look bitchy . " <p> I looked immediately at the girl 's breasts . Maybe it was the power of suggestion . They did seem somewhat bitchy in her silver tank-top , like they were gossiping together . Even though I was staring directly at her breasts , the girl 's eyes passed right over me and on to Jack . She slowly walked toward us . <p> Shouldering me aside , she asked Jack to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms and maneuvered between laughing and drinking people , guiding her in a pretty two-step . I settled back to watch , next to a random couple by the seltzer water and pretzels . The couple was arguing loudly . It 's hard not to listen , especially when you can : <p> Boy : Hey . I 'm sorry things did n't work out between us . I just do n't want the closeness . <p> Girl : The closeness ? I mean ... Jesus . People need people . <p> Boy : Not me . I am alone . Without warmth . Without need . I spilled my drink . <p> Girl , voice wobbly : Well , you have some of my things . My book . <p> Boy : Should I mail it to you ? <p> Girl : Mail it to me . <p> Boy : I do n't want to mail it to you . That 's so impersonal . <p> Girl : Mail it to me . <p> Boy : Maybe instead you could come over <p> Girl , voice of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laughed . Then I felt immediately lonely . I looked for Jack . The sparkly woman was leading him away by the hand . In passing , he grabbed me with his other hand and rumbled in my ear , " She 's taking me home to show me her- " then was yanked away . He waved on the way out . He was my ride . <p> In a few seconds he was back again , thrusting a twenty in my hand . " Can you get a cab ? " he asked , holding my shoulders and bending down to catch my eyes . " Is that okay ? " <p> " Of course , " I said , suddenly furious . <p> Jack landed a giant kiss on my forehead and left again . His absence seemed as absolute as his presence . I stewed , looking around . Men played air hockey in the corner , while women watched . Someone spilled a bottle of vodka and just left it there , leaking onto the carpet . A little terrier scrambled under the couch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy now sidled up to me and slurred , " So , what 's your story ? " He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt with hula girls all over it . <p> Have a boyfriend ? You married ? " <p> " Wan na be ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Want kids ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> His eyes finally managed to focus on my left eyebrow . " Can you speak a foreign language ? " he asked . <p> I excused myself and crossed the room . I leaned against the wall and nodded at the girl next to me , who was rolling a joint . She lit up , and we silently smoked it together . Then she wandered away . In a few minutes I realized that it 's not rude to ditch a party if nobody notices you 're there , so I called a cab and went home . <p> That same night , still stoned , I took off my clothes and stood in front of my full-length mirror . Did I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a cold early spring , and my limbs huddled together . Desperate legs ? Was my crotch ... <p> No . No . I covered my face with my hands . <p> Images of my breakup with Richard flared up . Mardi Gras beads swaying from the rearview mirror as he said , Do n't love you , the rim of dust on the speedometer , Not anymore , a dog crossing in front of the car and looking back at me for a long moment , Maybe I never did , then turning its head , following its leash , its sweeping tail the only happy thing in the world . <p> Nothing was worth that . I pulled the covers over my head and stayed that way until I fell asleep . <p> Since I 've thrown away all my lone socks , their mates have returned from the sea . I hold them in my hand , thinking , Where have you been all this time ? Why can only one of you exist in a single space ? <p> Back in the saddle , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consultant at my office named Andrew . He picked me up and took me around town , holding my hand . It was a warm spring night , and he stopped me in the street to touch my face and pull me closer . As he was kissing me , I was already wondering if he would call , his lips on my lips , our eyes closed . <p> Jack said , " What a loser . " <p> " What do you mean ? I have n't said anything bad about him . ' <p> " I can just tell . " He picked a leaf off my shoulder and rolled onto his back on the grass . His shirt poked up an inch , his pierced bellybutton showing . The park was empty except for the two of us . " This is a new one , right ? " <p> " Jack ! " I pulled up some dead grass and threw it in his face . He blocked it with his arm and squinted at me . <p> " Frankly , I ca n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> " What about sparkly girl ? " <p> " I drove her home but did n't go inside . I kissed her on the cheek . Went back to the party , but you were gone . " I stared at him . He waved a fly away and said , " She 'd never pass my test , anyway . I had a feeling . " I was still staring . " I did n't fucking feel like it , Eleanor , okay ? " <p> I had the goldfish test ; Jack had the Buyer 's Remorse Test . It 's very complicated-I do n't understand it . It 's a Pavlovian  --  response-voodoo kind of thing , involving the girl 's phone number , whether or not you feel like buying new underwear , what you do when you drive past her house , and a hair sample . I do n't know what you do with the hair . <p> I did n't see Jack all the rest of that week . Then early Sunday morning , he showed up unannounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . I was in pajamas , my hair bunched up . He did n't say a word , just walked over to my goldfish jar and picked it up . " What 's his name , " he demanded . The goldfish lurched around inside , bug-eyed . Stringy fish shit whirled up from the bottom . <p> I rubbed my eye . <p> " His name , " Jack barked . <p> " Andrew , " I said . I felt like a caught sadist . <p> Jack looked at the fish . " Andrew , " he said firmly . He walked out with my jar , my fish , my date . The door stuck open behind him . <p> The next day , Jack called me at work . He was mumbling . I leaned back out of my cubicle and looked at the window , open a slit . I caught my own dark eyes in the pale reflection on the glass . It was beginning to rain , quietly . <p> " Andrew died , did n't he ? " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , " Yes . " " He did n't call , " I said . <p> The weather was doing its crazy spring thing . Snow , then sun , seventy-degree weather , then many days of incredible wind . Power outages and the sudden peace that they bring . I tried to fly a kite , but it was too gusty , and the kite lodged itself in a tree . Downtown , the wind kicked up , and people 's white shirts simultaneously billowed out , making them look like pirates stranded far from their ships . People did strange things . As a homeless man passed by , he pointed his finger at me and said , " You just try speaking your mind in Tehran , missy " A woman in a pink suit stood at an intersection and sang loudly , into the traffic , " Do n't Go Breaking My Heart . " <p> Jack was also beginning to act different . He stopped telling me about his women , and he grew quiet when I told him about my latest non-adventures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing . For dropping a chopstick . For pointing at a painting in a museum . Once he grabbed my arm and hissed , " Eleanor . You are making me lose my mind . ' All I had done was show him a bruise on my elbow . Then he released my arm and wandered over to the pay phones and back . <p> One time he put his head in his arms and shook it , as if my mere presence were torturing him . I burst into tears , right there in the delicatessen . <p> Jack was immediately contrite , stroking my face , pulling tissues out of his pockets . Only Jack would come prepared with tissues . <p> " I 'm sorry " he said again and again . <p> " I do n't understand . You suddenly hate me . You pick on me . " <p> " I do n't hate you . I 'm just going through something . " <p> " What ? " I asked , blowing my nose . <p> Jack did n't say anything . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleanor . Cool it , " Jack said . <p> " What ? What ? Whywhywhywhywhy ? " <p> That night I went to dinner with my Turkish friend Deste , who had " erased " her last boyfriend and now had another . Things were going well with them , she said , because she treats him badly . " He has all these extra weights on his belly . I call him Fatty . " <p> " Deste ! He 'll be traumatized . " <p> " It 's better this way , " she said . " Walking in the street or out with friends , he 's going to say bad things , and I shut up . But at home I say , ' I do n't like the lunch you packed for me . Make it again . I do n't like ham today . " ' Her eyes wandered to the window . " Tonight , you will make a list of what you want ... " <p> " Another list , " I said . Apparently this was cross-cultural . <p> ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want a man who will shave his armpits . American men wo n't , so I want a Turkish man . So you make a list , and you look at the list every day , and fuck us on it . Fuck us hard . If you do n't fuck us , you will never find that guy . " <p> I stared at her . Then , " Oh , " I said quickly . Focus . " But I want someone who makes me forget about that stuff , " I said . <p> " That 's dangerous , " Deste said . " Never forget anything . Only forgive ! <p> I looked out the window , and there was Jack outside in the street , waving a cell phone at someone or something . This often happened-he was everywhere , all the time . I was beginning to think he was actually a yogi , inhabiting more than one body at once . The lights from the buildings tinted his skin orange . I pounded on the window to catch his attention . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away again . <p> " How about that man ? " Deste asked . <p> I was kind of daydreaming . I said , " Jack . That 's Jack . " Jack passed by once more , and I banged again on the glass , louder and louder , until people started twisting around in their seats to look at me . Jack turned his head in all directions . Deste pulled at my fist , but I used the other one until Jack finally walked away , stopping and looking back once as if he suddenly remembered something . <p> I had to go to a Saturday wedding . A coworker was getting married , and my pseudo-friend Marcy was going to be there . Marcy had married a lawyer , and I could no longer stand to talk to her on the phone . All she talked about was what her husband had fixed that week-the toilet , the patio door . She said she had a friend she wanted me to meet , named Paul . She had never been nice to me . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jack kept pretending to weep . The priest forgot the vows and instead made some up on the spot , insisting that Kathleen " obey " and telling Fred to say , " With this wing , I thee wed . " Fred said it verbatim , teeth clenched . Jack kept trying to hold my hand , and I slapped it away discreetly , biting the inside of my cheek . <p> While Jack scouted hors d'oeuvres at the reception , Marcy grabbed me and pushed me over to a short , chubby man with a kind face . He breathed hard as he gripped my hand . <p> Marcy said , " Paul 's a doctor . " <p> Paul said , " I do medical research . " <p> " Oh yeah ? " I asked . " That 's wonderful . Because everyone needs ... medicine . " <p> " I enjoy my specialty , " Paul said , hands in his pockets so that his stomach pooched out and his hips looked a yard wide . <p> " What do you specialize in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <p> Paul nodded quickly . A cracker crumb fell out of the corner of his mouth and onto the floor . <p> Marcy said , " Paul 's the leader in his field . ' <p> " There are n't too many of us , " Paul said , waving his hand . <p> " Still , " Marcy said . <p> I said , " Where 's the bathroom ? Do they have a bathroom here ? " <p> I did n't get more than a few steps away before Marcy pulled me aside , her fingers pinching my upper arm . She hissed , " I was kind of thinking you and Paul would get along . But you brought that guy . " She was holding me in place . <p> " Jack , " I said , glancing at him . He waved a cracker at me and mouthed , The good times are killing me . I turned to Marcy . " I wanted to bring a date . Everyone else has a date . " <p> " But I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What ? " <p> " That I wanted you to meet Paul . " <p> " Yeah . I met him . " <p> Jack sat down next to Paul and said loudly , " Soooo . you 're a mucous man . <p> " Ha ha , " Paul said sourly . <p> Marcy whispered , " I do n't know , I 'm disappointed . Paul 's been so lonely . " <p> " So get him a goldfish , " I said . " I have a goldfish . " <p> Jack boomed ( for my benefit ) , " How do you get your samples ? Do they use special tissues ? " <p> Marcy said , " Give him a chance . " <p> " I do n't want to " I said . <p> Paul said , " I do n't work with the actual mucous . I have assistants for that . I do the more theoretical stuff . " <p> Marcy said , " You think you can be so picky , Eleanor ? " <p> Jack said , " Theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Jack , Paul on my other side . Marcy and her nondescript husband sat facing us across the round table . We dug into our scratchy , filmy salmon and waterlogged yellow squash . Jack and I drank a boatload of wine , toasting everything . The waiter spilled a glass of water . We toasted him , too . Halfway through the wedding torte ( Kathleen and Fred 's attempt at non-controversial originality ) , Marcy smiled and said , " I 'm so proud of you , Eleanor . I mean , you do n't have it easy . Your life 's not what I 'd call great . " <p> Oh , no , I thought . <p> " Look at you , " she said . " You 're unmarried , alone , struggling financially , you 're unmarried ... " <p> " I 'm twice unmarried , " I explained to everyone at the table . " Some people just do it once , but I 'm an over-underachiever . " Smiles shot from everyone 's faces at different intervals , like bullets at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " You do n't have a house , you do n't have any of the things we talked about wanting when we were in college . Remember ? And here you are , still so . hopeful . " <p> " Yeah , " I said . <p> " I ca n't believe this shit , " Jack said . <p> " She 's a trooper , " Marcy told Paul . <p> " I 'd like to make a toast , " I said , glass raised . The others raised theirs , too-it 's a reflex , the way applause breeds applause . I paused . " Here 's to suicide , " I said . I drained my glass and turned to Jack . " Wan na dance ? " <p> Jack stood up and faced Marcy . " You suck , " he told her . <p> I said , " Yikes , " jumped up , and pulled at Jack 's arm . He hung back , staring , lower lip slack . He looked like he was going to challenge Marcy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should do something . Marcy shrank in her chair . Paul 's mouth opened , food still in it . Jack took a loud , deep breath , as if he were going underwater . " You ... ' - we all waited , motionless- " really suck ; " Jack finished . He swayed a little . <p> I said , " I love you . ' <p> Jack jerked his head to stare at me . His mouth was open . Mine was , too . So I said it again , experimentally : " I love you ? " <p> And I did . Why ? Because I did . <p> " What kind of love ? " Jack asked . His fists were loosening . <p> " You know , " I said . " Love . " <p> Paul snickered . <p> Jack just stood still for about nine seconds . Then he quickly pulled me to his chest and dipped me all the way backwards until I could see the ceiling above his head . " Really ? " he asked . " Really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up and kissed me deeply , in a way that showed practice , forethought , and intoxication . I kissed him back , with all the ardor of my own experience . This is Jack , I thought . This is crazy . I heard some vague heckling from the table beside us . But Jack kept stubbornly kissing me until everything else faded and we were left alone with this newborn thing we had somehow created-strange , imperfect , so much better than the best of what 's around . <p> Author Affiliation
