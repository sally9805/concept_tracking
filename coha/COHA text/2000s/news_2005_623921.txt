<p> I suspect that many visitors feel some frustration at learning so little about the artist himself from the work on view in " Chuck Close : Self-Portraits , 1967-2005 " at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . After all , the idea still persists , well beyond its time , that a good portrait unmasks the sitter . <p> Nearly 40 years ago , when I first saw black-and-white paintings like the self-portrait that opens the Close exhibition , I wondered whether a painter could still mean a portrait as anything but a conceptual gambit . <p> " I was n't sure I meant them as portraits either , " Close told me while in San Francisco for the opening of his show . " I called them ' heads ' ; I did n't use the word ' portrait . ' They were supposed to be every man , every woman , going against the notion of Warhol 's ' superstars ' and Marilyn Monroe and that sort of thing . I just tried to paint totally anonymous people and it turned out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Philip Glass , " all of whom soon emerged as celebrities in the art world . <p> Close , 65 , a native of Washington state , arrived in New York with a master of fine arts degree from Yale in the mid- ' 60s , a moment of cultural ferment unlike any before it or since . <p> Pop art and minimalism had begun to eclipse the " action painting " of the so-called New York School , but several of its great figures  --  Willem de Kooning ( 1904-1997 ) , Barnett Newman ( 1905-1970 ) , Mark Rothko ( 1903-1970 ) , Philip Guston ( 1913-1980 )  --  continued to produce . <p> Clement Greenberg ( 1909-1994 ) wielded an influence then that no American art critic has since rivaled , though his star dimmed as ever fewer artists appeared to hew to his formalist prescriptions . <p> In every interview , including his conversation with me , Close has recalled how , early on , he took a contrarian cue from Greenberg . When he read somewhere that Greenberg had said the one thing a painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw an uncrowded path open before him . <p> Though he speaks lightly of it now , Close remembers how necessary it seemed to have a tight rationale for one 's work in the embattled New York art world of the late ' 60s . <p> " I thought that what made postwar painting different from British or European painting , " Close said , " was this commitment to the entire rectangle and a sense of all-over-ness , whether it was Pollock 's skein-like ribbons of color ... or Stella 's black stripes or de Kooning 's ' Excavation ' or Sol LeWitt 's things . And I wanted to do away with the typical hierarchy of a portrait that says features  --  eyes , nose and mouth  --  are what 's important and the rest does n't matter . " <p> In the minimalist spirit of the day , " I literally wanted to make every square inch the same , " Close recalled . So he resorted to an evenly ruled grid , a procedure he still uses , to transfer visual information from a photograph to canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 self-portrait at the entry to the SFMOMA show , he airbrushed away the grid as he worked . But he soon decided to let the grid show and once he did , its way of parceling out visual information and variations he has played on the scale and orientation of the grid and on the accretion of little cells and their varied contents into some sort of likeness . <p> Close takes more than portrait photographs  --  he also shoots nudes and flowers  --  " but I do n't make paintings from them , " he said . " Of all the variables I could alter , the one that seemed least interesting to alter was subject matter . There are other variables you can alter that change what you do in the studio , that keep it fresh and keep it from feeling like you 're plowing the same ground . " <p> The current show restricts subject matter even further to images of the artist himself . <p> Still " they 're just clusters of these marks that stack up to build a situation that reads like something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictorial syntax and vocabulary of the early pictures is really dumb . There ca n't be a dumber art mark than this , " a deliberate renunciation of the drama of New York School painting . " I wanted the stupidest , dumbest , most inarticulate art mark you could have . Just a dot  --  spray it on . " <p> That anti-expressionist spirit pervaded the work of many younger artists in late ' 60s New York . " We were all figuring out ways to build an image rather than paint it , " Close said of himself and painter friends such as Jennifer Bartlett and Joe Zucker . " Sculptors did n't want to work in bronze or marble or wax . They wanted to find a material that did n't have any art use . We were similarly trying to find ways of working that were not about paint-it-in , paint-it-out , scrape-it-off  --  some way of working all over at once . " <p> Some critics at the time dubbed Close a photo-realist because he based his paintings on photographs . But he began by regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't want a model in the room for three or four months , " Close said . " It would drive me crazy , drive them crazy . But also , they gain weight , they lose weight , their hair gets long , they cut it short , they 're awake , they 're asleep . And a painting becomes the mean average of all those conditions . I simply looked at photography as a way to jot down the information . " <p> Eventually he had to acknowledge his own camera works as something more than studio devices . A range of them appears at SFMOMA . " When I started working with Polaroid in the mid- ' 70s was the first time I took photographs that were not going to be used as maquettes for painting , " Close recalled . " And I said ' Oh my God , if I 'm making photographs that are going to stay photographs , that must mean I 'm a photographer . ' That really came as a shock ... But then I thought , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact it 's really the only thing I collect , and I do n't collect much . And photography or even the daguerreotypes "  --  several appear in the exhibition  --  " are a way to work quickly , because a painting takes at least a month . I can move quickly through the large Polaroids and it 's just nice to use your head in a different way . " <p> From the beginning , Close has chosen to work from the most neutral head shots he can get , of himself and others . " I do n't have people laughing or crying , " he said , " but if you 've laughed all your life , you 'll have laugh lines , if you 've frowned all your life , you 'll have crow 's feet on your brow . There 's all kinds of information in a face even if you just present it neutrally . " <p> Despite many years of experience taking photographs , Close still can not foresee which pictures will form the basis of paintings . " I shoot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " which is a problem because most people feel that if I 've shot them , it 's a contract . But I 'm plagued with indecision ... yet something always floats to the surface and demands to be painted . Sometimes it 's a picture of somebody I was n't particularly interested in painting and other times I 'm really dying to paint somebody and I never get an image that I want to work from . Basically , it 's my friends and family or other artists I have a significant relationship to through their art ... I do n't do commissioned portraits and I do n't paint college presidents or CEOs . " <p> The photograph continues to serve Close as a mediator between the immediacy of observation and the long march of a painting 's construction . " It has this ability to make poem-like cross-section of time , " he said of the photograph , " a frozen moment that then can be dealt with over months , as many as 12 or 14 months sometimes , in a more novelistic time frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopefully a painting will have some of the freshness of that instantaneous moment . " <p> Close enjoyed notable critical and commercial success from quite early in his career , but it nearly ended in 1988 when a spinal artery blood clot felled him , initially leaving him paralyzed from the neck down . <p> After eight months in the hospital physical therapy and a relocation and refitting of his studio , he resumed working , despite being confined to a wheelchair and lacking control over his hands . " I got enough return of motion that I was able to paint with a brush strapped to my arm , " Close said . " Luckily , you paint with your whole arm , you do n't really paint with your wrist and fingers . You draw with wrist and fingers , so I do n't draw anymore . That 's why I put so much energy into printmaking and other things , as a kind of drawing . " <p> Close noted that his work had begun to loosen up , with more brushwork and color filling each unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The only real change is the increased celebratory nature of the work post-hospitalization , " he said , " because I was just so happy to be able to get back to work . " <p> Scrutinize the big 1997 " Self-Portrait " and it appears almost to break down into little abstract paintings . Correspondence between local colors and the portrait likeness has become less and less straightforward as Close 's work has matured . <p> " I try to build something out of the least likely color you could possibly use , " Close said when I pointed this out . " Because I 'm going to do something and then put five or six correcting colors on top of it , I 'll have a blue underneath than orange and green . The correcting colors on top take a different route each time . And I find it all in context . All the decisions are made in the rectangle , instead of on the palette ... in context , adjacent to finished areas and in anticipation of what I want to do next . " Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind of problem-solving where you ask yourself questions where no one else 's answers will fit . " <p> Without rolling back to check all the time , how does he not lose the coherence of the image ? <p> " The analogy I use , " Close said , " is that of a composer who can go into a room and write one note for a bassoon , another for the French horn , and he knows from experience what the resultant combination of those notes played together will sound like . In a very similar way , I know what those four or five or six colors will read like from a distance . I also put English on the strokes . So they swell or shrink or they connect , or they might have a dark center or a light center or they might be ovals or oblongs or teardrops or whatever . ... I 'm very seldom surprised when I roll back that it does n't read like I thought it would . " <p> I wondered whether he noticed as he works the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crack myself up making these marks , " he admitted . " I never was a big fan of biomorphic painting , yet I find myself using all these biomorphic forms , you know , building something out of x ' and o 's and sock shapes and beer bottle shapes . " <p> True to the impression they make , introspection figures little in Close 's self-portraits . <p> " I have n't learned a thing about myself in all these years , " he said with a laugh , " except that it 's a record of my losing my hair and of changing taste in eyewear . I really do the self-portraits at least partially so I can be as tough on myself as I am on other people . I try not to flatter myself any more than I flatter anyone else . And so I celebrate my wrinkles and ... everything that people are upset about when I paint them . " <p> Chuck Close : Self Portraits 1967-2005 .
