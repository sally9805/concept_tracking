lengths to get what I want . The way I figured it at the time , it was a combination of rare animal passion and manufacturer 's error . It does happen , you know . Surely , all of the world 's unplanned pregnancies ca n't be from people silly enough to engage in unprotected sex , can it ? Regarding the passion and the error , er , at least that was how things came about the first time I was pregnant ... but then was n't really . Perhaps I 'd better back up a bit and explain . You see , Trevor and I had been to yet another friend 's wedding that weekend , so of course I was understandably depressed afterward . After all , I was n't an au courant Singleton or even a much maligned Smug Married , but rather , that lowest of the social lows , an inhabitor and cohabitor of that famed female limbo , an Unholy Unmarried , or UU for short , which looks kind of like a cow 's udders when seen on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Anyway , after the wedding , Trevor , being Trevor , since he knew he was n't ready to ask me to marry him but still wanted to make me feel better , had great sex with me . It 's always amazed me how often heartache and reallygreat sex go hand in hand . From what I hear other women say , I think it must be different for them . Hell , sometimes I think everything must be different for other people . But for me , the more melancholy , the bigger the bang . I mean , if I 'm actually happy , then I 'm probably eating something and even letting myself enjoy it , and sex is the furthest thing from my mind . But back to Trevor , great sex and pregnancy . So there we were , having great post-someone-else 's wedding sex , and I was thinking how not only had everyone I knew been getting married lately , but they were even having babies as well , when the thought occurred to me , What if I turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me than Trevor hit my high note , prophylactic rubber barrier and all , and the thought flew completely out of my mind . Until I did n't get my period when it was due three weeks later . Of course I told my best friend David - pronounced Duh-veed - right off the bat . " But this is great news , is it not , Jane ? " David asked in his overly precise English . David lived upstairs from Trevor and me . Just over the minimum height requirement for the Israeli military , in which he had served - I mean , they all do , right ? Israelis , that is - he was a regular spark plug . Given to wearing muscle T-shirts and early eighties-style blue jeans , as far as I could see he was the sole item in the plus column for bringing back Jordache jeans . He also had coils of black hair that , along with his bronzed skin , gave him a Semitic Caesar profile . A former fighter pilot , make that gay fighter pilot , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chef in his own trendy Covent Garden bistro , still in the planning stages . " In the Israeli military , Jane , you both ask and tell , and you take gays and women and anyone else who can handle an Uzi , " he 'd once told me over a shared bottle of Burgundy left over from a boeuf bourguignonne that a lover of his had failed to show up to share . When David suggested that my days-old pregnancy was great news , I found myself agreeing with him . After all , it was n't as though I had deliberately set out to snag Trevor , but this would certainly do the trick . Trevor was such a Do-Right Dudley that he was sure to marry me . At the time , I did n't even think about what an actual baby might actually mean . I also did n't think about the emotional consequences of telling people other than the father before I told the father . This was another one of those things that falls under the heading of I Did n't Plan It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but " had to do with how gleefully David had received the news . ( And him I 'd only told about the news first because Trevor was away on business in Singapore for the week . ) Bowled over by how happy my pregnancy had made him , I proceeded to tell a few more people . Oh , I did n't go overboard - well , maybe just a bit - did n't do anything so silly as telling my mother or sister or even the girls at work , but I did tell the Pakistani newsagent down the street ( " Here , have some curry - it will bring good luck " ) , a policeman who helped me jimmy my lock one night when I 'd locked my bag in the flat ( " You ca n't be too careful at night now that there 's two of you " ) and the odd stranger or two ; so , just enough to give me a taste of how the other half lives . Their combined reactions were enough to make me start to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , were I to miss out on being pregnant , that I 'd miss the potential for the world to be a rosy place . Of course , never one to do anything by halves , I started to tail pregnant women . You could n't really call it stalking , but I did spend the Saturday just prior to Trevor 's return trailing every prego I happened to casually encounter , until I finally settled on one who looked so close to delivery that I thought I might be called into service at any moment . And it was amazing the things I learned ! Following my quarry through a heavy doorway , I was surprised to see a man who 'd been walking ahead of both of us double back to hold the door patiently for her until she 'd squeezed her way through . I was still smiling my surprise when he let the door go just in time to smack me in the face . Apparently , the fact that I did n't have the equivalent of a sack of flour attached to the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of any courtesy . Oh , well . As I followed her about her rounds that day , it was n't even so much the common courtesies she was shown that impressed me , although I was damned shocked when the drunken old sot on the tube blearily yielded his seat to her so that she could " rest yer Madonna feet , luv . " No , it was more the mere fact that people actually talked to her , all the time ; perfect strangers who might step over their own mothers in the gutter kept making comments and asking her questions in the most solicitous manner imaginable : " When 're you due ? " or " Do you know yet if it 's a boy or a girl ? " or " Spring babies 're always so extra special - just like little sunny angels , they are , " this last from the bleary old sot . Why , it was as though someone had sprinkled pixie dust all over her ! Her existence seemed that enchanted , and I longed to find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only problem was that just as I was on the verge of telling Trevor , who had returned from his trip just in time to partake of the pre-celebratory Sunday dinner that was waiting for him , an odd thing occurred . As I was teetering on the precipice of my new future , while serving up a helping of the blanquette de veau that David had prepared for me to pretend to prepare , I felt an unwelcome twinge of pain in my lower back . " Fuckfuckfuck , " I swore under my breath , just barely restraining myself from slamming the pot back down on the stove . " What was that , Jane ? " " Nothing , " I informed Trevor , ignoring the twinge . " Just a little back pain . " " Mmm , " he said distractedly , still rifling through the post that had accumulated since he 'd been gone . " Perhaps you should take some Tylenol ? " " No , that 's okay . I 'm sure it will pass . " I brightened . " Ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speared a piece of meat . " Mmm , Jane , this is really great . It 's always so wonderful when you take it into your head to do the homemaker thing . " That sounded promising . ( Continues ... )
