Is Rudy Giuliani , hero of Sept. 11 and a former Mob-busting federal prosecutor , really taking his sterling reputation to  --  gulp !  --  WorldCom ? The place is a disaster : home to at least $9 billion in accounting fraud , $120 billion in vaporized shareholder wealth and the largest bankruptcy in history . Giuliani is not being asked to run WorldCom ( that falls to Michael Capellas , former No. 2 at Hewlett-Packard , who accepted the ceo job last week ) . But Giuliani has aligned with a group headed by bond investor David Matlin that is trying to seize control of WorldCom in bankruptcy court . Some bondholders want Giuliani to serve as chairman of the board . <P> Giuliani , who has called WorldCom a big " challenge , " apparently has not made up his mind about how involved he would be . But WorldCom is not the only troubled company he has his eye on . Sources tell TIME that Giuliani Partners , the ex-mayor 's consulting firm , is mapping out a broader role as a consultant to scandal-tarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been signed , but a major one will be announced within weeks , a source says . Giuliani Partners is also helping global real estate firm Cushman &; Wakefield vet for security problems . And it hopes to work with brokerage firms to resolve problems stemming from conflicts of interest in their stock-research departments . Merrill Lynch is one of several potential clients . " A lot of companies would benefit from working with us on their difficulties , " says Bruce Teitelbaum , a Giuliani partner . <P> But what benefit could " America 's Mayor " get from helping rescue WorldCom ? For a man with possible presidential aspirations , the move has advantages . It would allow him to stay in the spotlight and , if he helps turn the company around , be a hero again . Yet Giuliani may learn that messing with the debt of bankrupt companies is not necessarily a career-enhancing move . The distressed-debt market is a playground for vulture investors , a place to parlay others ' misfortunes into personal wealth . How would that resonate with voters ?  --  By Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
