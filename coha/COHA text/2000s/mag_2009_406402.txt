Kayrita Anderson 's mission : to get Georgia girls off the streets . " I COULD HAVE been one of those girls in a heartbeat , " says Kayrita M. Anderson , speaking about kids as young as nine who are forced into prostitution in Georgia at a rate of perhaps 200 to 300 a month . " All you need is that voice in your ear promising to buy you things and take you places , saying you 're beautiful . I would have bought into it hook , line and sinker . " Photograph : Kayrita Anderson 's efforts to help end teenage prostitution in Georgia include providing start-up money and resources to launch " A Future . Not a Past , " a statewide anti &shy; exploitation campaign . Like many of the girls  --  " runaways , pissed off or from bad family situations "  --  Anderson grew up hard , in her case in the small town of Lawrenceville , thirty miles northeast of Atlanta . She never knew her father . Her mother cleaned houses and " was immature , not supportive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " I raised myself , and I raised my mom . " Crediting a caring grandfather as her saving grace , Anderson escaped by attending beauty school in Atlanta , landing her first job at nineteen as a hairdresser for a popular salon . By twenty-six , she was earning six figures , traveling to European shows and displaying a confident image that belied her upbringing . " I dug myself out of the hole , " she says , her warm Southern voice slowing but studiously matter-of-fact . In the war with childhood demons , Anderson emerged the victor . Now thirty-eight and married for the past twelve years to Harold Anderson , a successful publisher of hobbyist and children 's books , Anderson has dedicated her time and , since 2002 , more than $2 million from the Harold and Kayrita Anderson Family Foundation ( hkafamilyfoundation.org ) to halting child prostitution throughout Georgia , especially in Atlanta . Like metropolitan centers across the United States , the city is a hub for young girls and the pimps who prey on them , often by kidnapping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they 're dependent and addicted . " It began with a story we read in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , around 2000 , " says Anderson . " It made me sick to my stomach to think there was this underground world going on right under our noses . " In response , Anderson began contributing to Angela 's House , a sanctuary for girls who have been on the streets . " I visited Angela 's House and expected to see tough , defiant-looking , rebellious kids , " she says , sounding both resolute and heartsick . " But these were little girls with soft faces enjoying a reading hour . Their rooms were filled with pom-poms and teddy bears . It was hard to believe the horrors they had been through . " Despite the foundation 's donations , up to $100,000 a year , Anderson did n't see real change . " Once you start digging , " she says , " you realize you ca n't just throw money at the problem . It 's too complicated . " Increasingly , sexual exploiters operate invisibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember what the johns look like , or they 're too afraid to turn in the pimps . These are n't just underprivileged girls , either , " says Anderson . So she and her husband began working to convene a strategy session with a few nonprofits and city officials . It took months and perseverance to move both their cause and their profile into Atlanta 's political and social limelight . Harold , who grew up in a small Alabama town , had resettled in the city only after marrying Kayrita . Neither one is much interested in charity galas . " We 're not the hobnobbing type , " says Anderson . By 2002 they had gathered an influential group for an initial planning session at Harold 's offices . It was there that he galvanized Kayrita 's deeper commitment . " We were all talking about what we could do , and Harold suddenly said , ' I want to put Angela 's House out of business . ' I about fell out of my chair . The House was dear to my heart and doing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root causes , we 'd be funding Angela 's House for years . That did something inside me . It switched on an engine . We needed to change to make change . " The result was a statewide campaign called " A Future . Not a Past " ( afuturenotapast.org ) , which was launched in August 2007 with an impact gift from the Andersons of $1 million . Partnering with Georgia governor Sonny Perdue , Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin , state legislators and local nonprofits , the initiative aims to protect girls by " building a barrier between our children and those who seek to exploit them , " says Kaffie McCullough , director of AFNAP and a longtime children 's advocate . The program works to prosecute and discourage predators , making it too expensive for pimps and too embarrassing for johns to continue business as usual . Anderson hopes to turn AFNAP into a nationwide model . " Kayrita understood that if she just kept funding services , there would always be girls who needed them , " says McCullough . " Instead , she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple 's gift to the Atlanta Women 's Foundation ( www.atlantawomen.org ) was inspired by the unprecedented vision of Women Moving Millions ( womenmovingmillions.org ) . This $150 million fundraising campaign was launched in November 2007 by a group of donors working with the Women 's Funding Network ( womensfundingnetwork.org ) to encourage affluent women ( and men ) to each donate $1 million or more to women 's causes . To date , WMM has raised $120 million and is on track to reach its goal by year 's end . " I did n't think I could afford such a gift , but I really can , " says Anderson . " It 's new territory for me . I went public about this because I want to encourage others of equal wealth to step up . " As her efforts gain traction , Anderson is likely to keep moving into the unaccustomed spotlight . " A child does n't wake up and decide to sell her body , " she says . " It 's coercion , forcibly done . I want to make a real difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every barrier out of the way . "
