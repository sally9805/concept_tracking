<p> Five of the principal players in the state 's ongoing debate about controlling growth met in The Post 's editorial-board conference room Jan. 11 for a discussion of their competing proposals . Participants were Weld County Commissioner Barbara Kirkmeyer , representing Colorado Counties Inc. ; Rich McClintock , executive director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group ( CoPIRG ) ; Rick O'Donnell , policy director for Gov . Bill Owens ; State Sen. Bryan Sullivant , R-Breckenridge , sponsor of the proposed Responsible Growth Act ; and Steve Wilson , government-affairs director for the Denver Metro Home Builders Association . Marshall Kaplan , executive director of the University of Colorado 's Institute of Policy Implementation and Wirth Chair program , moderated the conversation . <p> MARSHALL KAPLAN : What are the citizens telling us ? <p> BARBARA KIRKMEYER : Well , I think they 're telling us that , one , they want us to manage growth , but at the same time they want us to respect private property rights . In the surveys I 've looked at , I think they say that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept local , so that they can participate and influence the decisions . <p> BRYAN SULLIVANT : I think the citizens are actually saying more than that . I think they 're saying that they 're tired of the status quo . And I think they 're asking someone to provide the leadership to make the systemic changes that are required , or the procedural changes that are required , so that someone has a handle on how we 're going to shape the next 50 years in Colorado . <p> RICH McCLINTOCK : We think that citizens are concerned about everyday problems that result from this pattern of unchecked development that results in sprawl , particularly traffic that is a result of the pattern of development , as well as the loss of open space and farmland . <p> STEVE WILSON : The National Association of Home Builders did a survey of five high-growth cities in this country , just this fall . The citizens of the Denver area expressed the highest concerns about the rate of growth of any of the cities surveyed . I agree with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept at the local level . But I also agree with what the senator said , that individual decisions by local cities and counties do n't always make sense on a regional basis . And that 's the balance that we 're trying to achieve here . <p> RICK O'DONNELL : For people who remember Colorado in the late ' 80s , growth has brought us tremendous benefits , it 's allowed the renaissance of lower Denver . But growth is n't an issue that 's universal across Colorado . In rural Colorado , they do n't have enough growth . In rural Colorado , they 're concerned about job losses , they 're concerned about stagnant economies . It 's important to recognize we 're a diverse state . Some areas are really concerned about traffic congestion and loss of open space . Others are concerned they do n't have enough economic opportunities . <p> KAPLAN : Each of you has a proposal ( to ) capture the opportunities , minimize the problems , and enhance the quality of life in Colorado . Could I ask each of you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to preserve open space and agricultural land . And the governor is proposing a number of tax incentives to encourage land owners to protect undeveloped land and to make it worthwhile for them to keep that land in its natural state , or as wildlife habitat or as agricultural ranchland . <p> A second large component is giving local governments new tools to deal with growth , giving counties and municipalities some new tools to work together , encouraging them to cooperate and giving them additional funds , as they try to plan regionally . <p> The third large component is looking at the affordable-housing issue and encouraging homebuilders and developers to not only build low-income rental housing , but encourage business to help their low-income employees in high-cost areas with home-purchase assistance . <p> KIRKMEYER : The proposal from Colorado Counties Inc. and the Colorado Municipal League actually builds right off of what the governor 's plan is . Our plan , basically , respects private-property rights , it respects the local decision-making process , it allows the public to participate in the whole process and be involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster coordination between the municipalities and the counties . And it also curtails urban sprawl . <p> It goes back to having dollars there for some of the smaller communities and counties that do not have comprehensive plans , providing technical assistance to those communities that do not have planners on staff but need that type of technical assistance . We 're looking at the annexation plans , annexation limits , it encourages counties and municipalities to work together to encourage development to go to municipalities , or at least adjacent to municipalities , where there 's already infrastructure in place . <p> SULLIVANT : Well , the Responsible Growth Act provides for the actual mechanisms to implement what the CCI and the CML bill say that they 'd like to do . It requires that the comprehensive plans that are locally generated become mandatory and no longer advisory documents . It provides for regional planning and puts in place a mechanism to do such , as opposed to encouraging it , and it also provides for a systematic way for a local community to put together its development plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with . <p> When we 've got a new community like Broomfield that 's attracting 20,000 new jobs and has a growth cap of 300 , that 15 pounds of flour in a 5-pound bucket 's going somewhere . And I think that 's of statewide interest . <p> WILSON : The facts are that in Colorado we 've been planning and planning and planning for generations . We have more planners per capita in the state of Colorado than any other state in the nation . Eighty percent of the communities , or counties at least , statewide already have comprehensive plans . Instead of working on more planning , we need plans that work . And we need to look at statutes that ensure that homebuilders can build houses where they 're supposed to build houses . And where we 're supposed to build houses is close to the jobs . Instead , in the metro area , we have I think a pervasive anti-housing regulatory framework and policy framework at the local-government level . <p> We need to ensure that comprehensive plans mean something , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike . We need to bring economic common sense into the comprehensive-planning process through a jobs-housing balance . <p> McCLINTOCK : To address the impacts of growth and unwanted sprawl , three key elements are necessary . The first is to redirect growth into existing areas , through the establishment of urban growth areas , that would actually create a clear map of where growth should occur , and then establish open-space protection zones outside of those urban areas , to ensure that the growth is in fact redirected back inside the area . <p> The second piece is to ensure that the critical open-space areas and wildlife habitat and agricultural lands have permanent protections . <p> And third is to address the fiscal impacts of sprawl by working on mechanisms to better force growth to pay its own way . Taxpayers now are subsidizing both the construction of roads and schools in communities across the state . We think there need to be stronger mechanisms for making sure that growth pays its own way . <p> KIRKMEYER : You 're all addressing your questions basically for the whole Front Range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing anything that happens in the rural areas , or most of Weld County . Because , the truth is , out in the rural counties , municipalities and the counties are working together and doing a very good job at it . There are several counties and municipalities that have intergovernmental agreements dealing with growth so we do n't duplicate services , so we are n't putting more tax burden on our residents . <p> But , 10 years ago , Broomfield was , what , a bedroom community ? And everybody was clamoring for more growth , and wanted more business and more jobs and more economic development . And now they 're getting criticized because they brought in more jobs , but now they 're not doing the housing part of it . Well , you know , the balance , the pendulum is going to go back and forth all the time , and they 're doing the best they can . <p> Obviously what happens in Broomfield is going to impact Erie and the other communities that surround it , but I think Broomfield went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently signed an intergovernmental agreement that proposes tax revenue sharing along the Interstate 25 corridor , proposed a demarcation line , and also proposed where the buffer would be and how each community would pay for that buffer . <p> So ( local control ) can work , and that 's what the CML and CCI proposal is based on . <p> O'DONNELL : Marshall , I do n't necessarily agree with the premise of your question . Colorado has grown phenomenally this decade , and metro Denver has grown phenomenally , and our air quality is better . There 's little evidence in any of the statistics I 've seen that the majority of Coloradans have a longer commute today than they used to . Or anywhere in the country . The average commute is under 20 minutes , for most people . The idea that everybody is commuting 45 minutes from home to work is n't true . Rich talks about sprawl , and sprawl 's awful . Well , sprawl 's a negative term for something a lot of people call positive , which is suburbs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no sign that that 's slowing down . <p> KIRKMEYER : As a person who 's on the front line and in those land-use hearings , and having to make those decisions , and listening to those citizens all the time , I know citizens are telling us they want us to manage growth . We 've had citizens in municipalities in Weld County who have said , we want to take our annexations to a vote . And they take them to a vote . And most of those annexations are still passing . So they 're not saying no to growth , they 're saying we want to participate and have a say in it - and we want it kept at our level . <p> KAPLAN : Let me try to get back to the home-rule question . What does your bill do when you have competitive home rules in effect and/or regional negative effects of spillover - sprawl , affordable housing , air quality pollution ? <p> SULLIVANT : It takes the good idea that 's in the CML-CCI bill and puts together a mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross-reference each other 's plans realizing that each and every one of these communities is not an island unto themselves . <p> KAPLAN : One of the city council people in this city said that the problem with DRCOG 's 2020 plan is it has all the right objectives but it has no enforcement mechanism , and when the economy turns south , everyone will be competing again for the last regional shopping center in the metropolitan area , and negotiation and volunteerism will fall by the wayside . <p> SULLIVANT : Actually , the Responsible Growth Act provides a mechanism for local governments to negotiate their differences in an expedited manner , and recognizes that regional planning is important not only to the two parties at hand but to their neighbors as well . <p> WILSON : I 've been involved in the 2020 process for four or five years . I think it 's a fine plan , it 's just as , you said , some people say it 's a great plan , it has great goals . But I 'm concerned the 2020 process will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Denver Regional Council of Governments has done , which is on a shelf somewhere gathering dust . The first regional plan in the metro area was done in 1958 . <p> The Metro Mayors Caucus spent a year and a half working on a great plan for affordable housing , with all of these recommendations to remove regulatory barriers for affordable housing . Not one major building jurisdiction in the metropolitan area has adopted a single significant act consistent with the recommendations of that plan . <p> I think we need some very simple legislation that sets a framework for local decision-making , that makes - requires - local governments to own up to the effect that their individual decisions have on their neighbors . Bryan 's bill does n't list 40 things that local governments are supposed to do , it says ' jobs-housing balance , ' for example . And those are very important things that need to be included to make sure the 2020 vision plan leads to action in 2020 . <p> KAPLAN : Twenty-five states now have enabling legislation of some sort that allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to strengthen the link between local plans and the regional plan in terms of the consistency of both . And 25 states , at last count , have the right to override local decisions that affect other communities within the area in terms of housing affordability or pollution of the water systems . Would the state of Colorado ever envision that ? <p> O'DONNELL : One , I believe the state of Colorado already has the authority to stop water pollution . If you have two competing jurisdictions , the governor will propose , and is proposing , an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism , as a vehicle to help mediate disputes between two jurisdictions that have irreconcilable differences . But when you talk about regional governance , you have those who are being governed and those who are governing . And I think the most important thing is that you have accountability . Who is writing the plan ? Who is voting upon it ? Do citizens elect a regional government ? If you took a poll in metro Denver , and you asked , ' Do you know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 4 percent would have any clue . <p> McCLINTOCK : Growth is causing regional problems . Communities are having workers work in one community , yet live in another , in mountain communities across the state . So there need to be better mechanisms to enable those communities to deal with their differences if one community 's growth plan is going to bump up against the next community 's plan . <p> KIRKMEYER : Back to regional governance . You know , that 's just one more step removed from the public . First of all , there are mechanisms to allow for regional cooperation and the governor is going to put forth a dispute-resolution process . I think that 's an appropriate role for the state . <p> But the fact is each community has its own values , and it 's diverse , and if there is n't flexibility , then we 're all going to look like each other . That 's not what the people want . <p> KAPLAN : What is the primary weakness that each of you sees in the others ' proposals ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sounds like Barbara is arguing that Boulder 's growth-management of 20 years ago - of grabbing all the jobs they can get and forcing the people to live somewhere else - that it 's fine for Broomfield to replicate that . <p> KAPLAN : OK , now what about the governor 's proposal ? <p> WILSON : I think , as Sen. Sullivant said , there 's not enough money in the treasury to offer the kind of incentives ( to have ) the kind of meaningful impact on the growth-management issues that face the state , particularly in the Front Range . As to Sen. Sullivant 's bill , the biggest weakness is its size . You know , trying to take a big swipe at an issue so complicated as growth management is a very difficult thing to do . <p> SULLIVANT : I think the governor is doing the right thing in throwing out some general ideas and then leaving it to the Legislature to craft the specifics . As to the Colorado Counties-Municipal League bill , I just find it almost laughable that we talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow us to protect private-property rights . I 've sat in that committee room for six years , and that 's all I 've heard , testimony after testimony about how local government is crushing private-property rights . That 's the reason that we have private-property rights bills , that 's the reason that we have vested-rights bills . What the Responsible Growth Act was intended to do was to protect private-property rights , and it does so by holding these locally elected officials accountable , and not allow them to run roughshod over each and every landowner , depending on the day of the week . <p> O'DONNELL : On CCI and CML , I 'm not sure it 's a weakness in their bill , it 's something it does n't address . One of the biggest issues among local governments is the tax base , and fighting over tax revenue . We do n't want $ 100,000 homes because they ' do n't pay their way , ' only the $ 300,000 homes ; and we all want the sales tax revenue . Over the next 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax of e-commerce ? Colorado 's got to address , at some point , our local tax structure , and I think it has a big impact on growth . And their bill is probably not the one to do that . But it 's an issue that local governments have to face at some point , so I would call it a weakness in that it 's unaddressed . <p> In Bryan 's approach , I would just caution to go slowly in establishing urban service areas , which are , in essence , growth boundaries in Colorado . I think there 's mixed evidence from across the world that they 're effective ; I think there 's some evidence they price low-income and lower-middle class people out of housing , that they encourage leap-frog sprawl , and they have a lot of unintended consequences . <p> KAPLAN : How about the homebuilders ? They do n't have a bill yet . But you 've heard Steve . <p> O'DONNELL : I just think artificially saying that governments need to have a jobs-housing balance ignores some of the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-market economy , local governments do n't have absolute control over how many jobs are created and how many people want to live in that community . So , while we struggle with economic development policies and housing caps , which create problems , we also have got to recognize that there 's a job-creating-and-housing market at work that we can not necessarily control as some planners might like . <p> McCLINTOCK : The concern we have about the CML-CCI proposal in particular is that a community is only required to make its plans binding if it chooses to do so . So those responsible communities that are already inclined to follow their plan will choose to do so , and those very communities who really ought to be sticking to their plan will opt not to . <p> Our biggest concern with the policies that the governor has laid out regarding open space is about having short-term leases for protection of open space and agricultural land . If we have a 20-year lease for land and the price just goes up then we 've only bought ourselves a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sen. Sullivant has really developed an overall , comprehensive bill that includes urban service areas . I think we are going to still see a problem with fiscal aspects , because we are n't yet addressing the problem that many communities do n't have the tools necessary to truly establish full cost for the impacts of sprawl . <p> Current taxpayers are in fact subsidizing future Coloradans moving in , and we 're facing one and a half million people moving to Colorado in the next 20 years . We 've got to figure out who 's going to pay for those costs , and do our best to minimize the costs . <p> WILSON : If growth does n't pay its own way , why do we have a $ 500 million surplus ? Period . We can all argue about the details , but we have a $ 500 million surplus because the growth is so high , and it looks to me that it is certainly paying its own way . <p> O'DONNELL : There 's a flip side . Some people will see costs in higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment buildings , they feel that there 's less space for them and their family , they feel that there 's not as many choices as they would like in venues for entertainment or shopping or for business . It 's personal preferences . Some people will say that the slightly higher densities are a great thing . Other people may find them not to be a great thing . <p> KIRKMEYER : I think the worst thing about Sen. Sullivant 's bill is that it starts removing the public from the process . <p> The home builders want a guarantee that they can build their homes all over the place . Well , I thought you said the concern was that people are worried about urban sprawl and all this growth that 's occurring . So that 's kind of contradictory . <p> As far as CoPIRG , they want to force regional cooperation . I think it 's better to try to get regional cooperation , and in fact people are working together , communities are working together . <p> SULLIVANT : Growth in Colorado has got be viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at around the edges . It 's going to take some visionary planning and we can not continue along the status quo . I 'm suggesting that we take a step in that direction - as imperfect as that may be . <p> McCLINTOCK : In the hour that we 've been talking , another 10 acres has been lost to development . And we think that it 's critical that the Legislature take action that will slow the rate of sprawl . <p> The public is saying loud and clear that they want these issues addressed : How are you going to reduce the traffic that I 'm facing every day ? And how are you going to save the land for future children of Colorado ?
