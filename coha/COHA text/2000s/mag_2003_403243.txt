WEEKEND Headnote The Big Sky state has its share of posh spas-and then there 's Jackson Hot Springs Lodge , a down-home Montana affair . // Entering Jackson Hot Springs Lodge , my eyes need to adjust from the bright Montana sun outside . When they do , I 'm not sure they 're to be trusted . Animals , or rather their heads and hides , hang from the lobby 's knotty pine walls . There must be a hundred ungulates here : moose , elks , wildebeests , buffalo , African duikers . It seems over-the-top even for rough-hewn Montana . Jackson Hot Springs Lodge is the biggest establishment in the one-horse town of Jackson , which sits in the Big Hole River Valley- " The Land of 10,000 Haystacks , " a chamber of commerce brochure proclaims-in the southwestern corner of the state . Set 30 feet back from Highway 278 , it looks like , well , a roadside motel . With a big bar . I imagine it 's a place where the locals-all 50 of them-feel right at home . Fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon feel at home too , enough so to ask about the animals overhead . The African animals are on loan from a local rancher , and the staff remember a mounted deer that was shot in Africa by Teddy Roosevelt ( it departed with a previous owner ) . Paging through the yellowed guest book by the lobby 's fieldstone fireplace that evening , I see I 'm not the only visitor won over by the place 's funkincss . The resort was built by an heiress to the Procter &; Gamble fortune in the 1950s and became a favored wilderness escape for Hollywood and East Coast society . Even earlier , William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame camped at the natural hot springs that feed today 's pool . He wrote about how his group competed to see whose meat cooked fastest in the 100-degree water . ( No one knows who won , but in his journal Clark said he boiled his chunk in 25 minutes . ) The resort 's heyday has come and gone ... several times . In the late 1970s the main lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother took his half to Dillon , 45 miles away , while the other left his on the original site ) . Its current incarnation is due to managers Monte and Inge Peterson , who have made the resort comfortable in the local style . Martha Stewart would find the furnishings in my room on the spartan side , and the reading material-auto parts catalogs , the Helena newspaper-wo n't be a hit with all guests . But then , my " room " is a cavernous private cabin with fireplace and a view of all that Montana is famous for : big skies , big valleys , big mountains . And the service is topnotch . While I 'm dining in the resort 's pine-walled restaurant-you 've got to like a place that serves tequila-marinated ahi tuna and ostrich flank steak-Inge Peterson 's son is preparing a lire in my fireplace , stopping short of lighting it so I can go home and tell friends I made a fire . Of course you 'll want to see more of Big Sky country than what 's out your cabin window - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , is an outdoorsman 's paradise-so go , as I did , to Miner Lake , a popular local fishing destination nine miles from the lodge , for a day hike . Because hiking through fly-fishing land in Montana without a rod in hand verges on a crime only slightly less serious than asking for a vegetarian menu , rent a fly rod in nearby Dillon or Ennis and try your technique in the streams flowing in and out of the lakes . It 's said that some streams here are so full of fish that you do n't need a rod : You can " tickle " fish right into your creel . " You ca n't not catch a fish here , " says Inge Peterson . Staying at the lodge means that you 'll end up in its hot spring . This hot spring , however , is Montana utilitarian ( often the real " real deal " in this rugged state ) : a giant cement pool . Still , the minute I dove in I fell in love . The absence of ambience was utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest bathtub . And the water was true to Clark 's diary entry-it was hot .
