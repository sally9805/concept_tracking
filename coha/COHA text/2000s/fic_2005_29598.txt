Chapter One Darrel Two Moons and Steve Katz were having a late dinner at Cafe Karma when the call came in . The restaurant was Katz 's choice . Again . Two Moons watched his partner put aside his Eden-Yield Organic Lamb Plus Eclectic Veggie Burrito with great reluctance and fiddle in his pocket for his chirping pager . It was just after ten-thirty p.m . Probably another south side domestic violence . For five weeks running , Darrel and Katz had worked the four p.m. to two a.m . Special Investigations shift . Their calls had consisted of feuding spouses , gang assaults , various and sundry alcohol-related issues , all taking place below St. Michael's-the Mason-Dixon Line that split Santa Fe and was more than an arbitrary map squiggle . It was three weeks before Christmas , and the first few days of December had signaled an easy winter , with daytime temperatures in the forties . But four days ago , the weather had taken a drop : fifteen degrees Fahrenheit at night . The snow that had fallen during this serious drought year remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their shift was one big freezer burn . At least the weirdos who ran Cafe Karma kept the dive warm . Downright hot . A big and tall kind of guy to begin with , Darrel was drowning in clothing , sweating in his black wool shirt and black tie , black corduroy sports coat , and heavy black gabardine slacks tailored in Germany and inherited from his father . His quilted black ski jacket was draped over a horribly hand-painted chair , but he kept the sports coat on to conceal the department-issue .45 in its X-harnessed cowhide shoulder holster . No problem hiding his unauthorized boot gun , a nickel-plated .22 . It nuzzled his calf , snug in his left custom-stitched elephant-hide Tony Lama . Katz had on what he 'd worn every night since the weather had turned : a fuzzy brown and white plaid Pendleton shirt over a white cotton turtleneck , faded blue jeans , black and white high-top sneakers . Over his chair was that ratty gray wool overcoat-pure New Yawk . How could he keep his feet warm in those Keds ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally freed the now-silent pager . Over by the pastry case , the multipierced Goth waitress who 'd served them-or tried to-stood gazing into space . She 'd taken their order with vacant eyes , then had proceeded to the coffee machines , where the detectives watched her spend six straight minutes foaming Katz 's Green Tea Chai Latte . Six and a half , to be precise : The detectives had timed her . Staring into the foam , like it held some kind of big cosmic secret . Darrel and Katz had exchanged knowing glances , then Two Moons had muttered under his breath about what was really cooking in the back room . Katz had cracked up , his big red mustache rising and falling . This month , another team was handling narcotics . Katz studied the number on the pager and said , " Dispatch . " A bit more fumbling in another pocket and he produced his little blue cell phone . Another meal cut short . Two Moons ate fast as Katz called in . He 'd ordered as close to normal as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home fries and sliced tomatoes . Specifying no sprouts , but they 'd stuck a tumbleweed of the stuff on his plate anyway . Darrel hated it ; it reminded him of cattle fodder . Or something picked out of a comb . Just looking at it made him want to spit . He removed it and wrapped it in a napkin , whereupon Katz immediately grabbed it and snarfed it down . If it were up to Katz , they 'd be here every night . Darrel conceded that the food was consistently good , but atmosphere was another issue . With its snaky walkway embedded with pebbles and shards of mirror glass , antiwar petitions tacked to the Technicolor walls of the tiny entry , and cell-like rooms full of mismatched thrift shop furniture and incense fumes , Karma was what his gunnery sergeant father used to call " hippie-dippie left-wing lunacy crap . " Somewhere along the way , his father had changed , but Darrel 's army-brat upbringing stuck with him . Give him a burger and plain old fries in politically neutral surroundings . Katz reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fe PD to the county building on Highway 14-police , fire , city , county , everything integrated-and most of the dispatchers were no longer familiar voices . But this time was different : Katz smiled and said , " Hey , Loretta , what 's up ? " Then his face grew serious , and the big copper-wire mustache drooped . " Oh ... Yeah , sure ... Where ? ... You 're kidding . " He hung up . " Guess what , Big D ? " Darrel chomped on his burger , swallowed . " Serial killer . " " Half correct , " said Katz . " Just a killer . Blunt-force homicide on Canyon . " Canyon Road was very high-rent , just east of the Plaza in the Historic District , a narrow , leafy , quiet , pretty place lined with gated compounds and galleries and expensive cafes . The hub of Santa Fe 's art scene . Darrel 's pulse rate quickened from forty to fifty . " Private residence , right ? Not a gallery at this hour . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing and sliding into the ratty gray coat . " Very much a gallery . The d.b. ' s Larry Olafson . " ( Continues ... )
