Does taking antibiotics really double a woman 's risk of getting breast cancer ? That was the clear impression left by some headlines last week , but that may say more about the dangers of first impressions than it does about antibiotics . <P> The news sprang from a review of the medical records of more than 10,000 women who belonged to a Seattle-area health plan . The study , published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , compared pharmacy and breast-cancer-screening records and found that women who filled 25 or more prescriptions for antibiotics over a 17year period developed breast cancer at twice the rate of those who took no antibiotics . Moreover , there seemed to be what scientists call a dosage-response trend : among women who took more antibiotics , the death rate from cancer was even higher , as much as 3 1/2 times as great . <P> But there is a big difference between a statistical link and a causal relationship . It 's entirely possible that breast cancer was creating the women 's need for antibiotics ( rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example . Or that an underlying problem  --  perhaps chronic inflammation  --  was making the women 's bodies a breeding ground for both bacterial infections and tumors . It 's worth noting that the antibiotics users were , on average , older and heavier , had stronger family histories of cancer and were more likely to use hormone-replacement therapy  --  all risk factors for breast cancer . It is the sort of study , noted Dr. Roberta Ness in an accompanying editorial , that raises more questions than it answers . <P> That does n't mean that there are n't risks in taking antibiotics . The drugs are real lifesavers , but they have been dangerously overused for decades , creating strains of bacteria that are resistant to first-line antibiotics and forcing doctors to use stronger and stronger drugs . Antibiotics should be prescribed only for bacterial infections and not for colds or the flu , which are caused by viruses . Once you start taking an antibiotic , you should always take the full course , even if you start feeling better before finishing the regimen ; otherwise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't insist that your doctor give you an antibiotic when it is n't necessary . Many doctors will cave under pressure , but you should n't put them in that position . They really do know what is good for you . <P>  --  With reporting by A.
