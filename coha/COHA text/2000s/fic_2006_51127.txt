Here 's the reason why Michael Kandel was one of the first people asked to tackle Harlan Ellison 's project : he does schlubs well . Just check out Captain Jack Zodiac if you need proof . His many other talents include writing , editing , and translating , but we 'll let it suffice as an introduction to this funny story to say that he does schlubs well . Many of our early readers said this story was their favorite of the three takes on Lady Luck . <p> - By Cumby. - By Gumby. - Father , I have sinned. - Of course you have , my son . - But - Yes , go on , my son . - That is not why I am here . - You are troubled . -A troubled silence. - Your soul is like the sea that casteth up mire and din ( Isaiah 57:20 ) . - In a whisper . I have lost my faith . - Have n't we all , my son , have n't we all . - Father , when I levitate in the morning , in my cell , during the Seven Supplications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second drawer of my humble privy locker. - Ah. - When I pass through walls now , on the way to mass or mess , I find that I must hold my breath . - Loss of focus . It happens to the best of us . Especially when , er , you know , seed is spilled ( Genesis 38:9 ) . - Father , my visions now are ... in black and white . - Merciful Gumby. - Father , do you know why I came to the monastery in the first place ? I was no seeker after the lux everlasting . I was an undercover hack for the Hoboken Tribune . Those supercilious pieces they do on UFOs and religion ? - Sotto voce . We do seem to get an awful lot of reporters here . -I was paid to write a feature on the " freak show " ( forgive me ) at th Mount of Miracles . The inner-sanctum annual casting-out-of-demons ritual . I took pictures , a camera tucked in my cowl ; I recorded , a mike concealed in my cassock . I came for the money , strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The root ( 1 Timothy 6:10 ) . -I 'm thinking of going back to the States . Getting , I do n't know , a law degree . Drinking again . Having congress again . Maybe going to the races . - You accomplished so much here , my son . -A sigh. - The sigh is echoed . Monk and abbot regard each other for three beats. -I 'm a loser , Father . Time to face it . I 'm not cut out for the Spiral Path of Tu . I 'll buy a house in the suburbs . Watch sitcoms on TV . Laugh with the canned laughter . - We never know what we 're cut out for . Until the very end . Even then we do n't know . Our creator alone knows . I could tell you a story . -I am a bitter disappointment to you , Father . - Not at all , my son . Gumby loves you . I love you . Truly . -I despise myself . I am filled with such loathing for myself . I would brain myself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millennium tu setback for the pestle. - The story of Brother Anselm , yes . It is time that you heard it . - Do not waste any of your saintly breath on the vile likes of me , Father . - You 'll see , at the conclusion , why . the story must be kept eternally under wraps . Which is a great pity , for it is instructive . A deeply triste tale , yet also a cheap joke . Like the narrative of any life , I suppose , or like that of a great many . Does our creator weep or laugh , watching us from his high seat in the empyrean ? BROTHER ANSELM began as a loser . Oh , you misunderstand me altogether if you think he was a loser in an ordinary way . He was more a loser - far more - than any other creature bom to woman , including those untimely ripped . To say that failure was his watchword , emblem , banner , and middle name is to understate . He choked on his own spit . He bit his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . He sprained ankles on less . Garbage thrown from windows always found him . Ditto bird excreta of every known and unknown species . If opportunity knocked , it was a sure bet that Brother Anselm would be in the crapper , in medias . In short , this man was the very incarnation of t . He was not Anselm then , at the time I speak of , nor was he one of us , of the Brethren . His name was George . I withhold his last name till the end of this tale , for pedagogical purposes . Brother Anselm - George - fell in love . Luck would have it - I mean , his uncannily uncommonly bad luck would have it - that the object of his love , this woman , was an uncannily uncommonly powerful gifter of t . Good fortune clung to her as faithfully as the lowering cloud of jinx and Jonah followed the every step of Joe Bfstplk . You never heard of Joe Bfstplk ? No matter . Before your time . It was a simpler time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sighs of men escorted her through every room and down every avenue like an endless murmur of an arboreal breeze at eventide . Her skin was coffee cream , her eyes lambent as cut iridium , and her luxuriant hair , as she walked , swayed like a delicious skein of sinfully susurrant silk . But I digress . And am too long in the tooth and too long in this vale now , Gumby knows , for such pulsequickening envisioning .... She worked as a hostess at The Midas Palace , in a city of casinos owned by taciturn and tattooed aboriginals of Oceania . This mighty neon Babylon of Mammon seemed to have sprung up overnight , yet already it eclipsed Las Vegas tenfold , and its hour of judgment had not yet come ( Revelation 18:10 ) . She would sit at your table , but of course you had to pay . You would win phenomenally in her presence - a million kronen at a mere three tosses of the dice - then pay the house a million and a quarter for the privilege . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that and with Lily 's smile echoing through the chambers of your dim mind as the roseate flush of dawn glimmers like a ludic zephyr o'er the limpid waters of a Disney lagoon ? There is , to put it simply , a sucker born every minute ( Job 12:25 ) . George had come to Midas , like so many , in a last desperate attempt to raise himself out of the foul and sucking fen of penury . He had hocked everything and now held the rials in his two trembling hands . He needed to pay a sea of late fees and fines imposed by an unforgiving IRS ; he needed to pay alimony in great arrears to three avaricious and implacable exes , - he needed to pay for an operation that would remove the hideous plantar wart from the tip of his nose as well as for an operation that would remove the suppurating blastema from the tip of his , forgive the expression , procreative member . Seeing Lily - she was gracefully ( as always ) poised by the roulette wheel among an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ televangelist , each slicker and more venal than the next - George fell at her feet . From an access of love and smitten also by a sudden spasm in his left calf ( from a chronically spiking potassium ion deficiency ) . The rials went everywhere , clattering and spinning as they clattered , every one , into unreachable nooks and crevices . The CEO , general , and televangelist laughed , but Lily took pity : George was so vulnerable and obviously in want of mothering . She gave him a moue of sympathy . You might think that his wretched tide was turning , at this sort of epiphanic crux . A moue from Lily Lu , after all , signified , for most mortals , a decided filling of the sails of circumstance . You might conclude that her t would trump his t , and love would conquer all . Alas , nothing could be further from the truth ! Buoyed by this beckoning gesture of happiness , George took hope . As he was being given an unceremonious heave-ho from the Midas ( since now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strobing air toward a fetid ditch , he determined to take his fate into his hands and tackle the problem of his existential curse . Little knowing the awful path on which this seemingly constructive step would place him . First , he tried positive thinking . That bombed totally . Second , he joined a support group , then went to licensed group-therapy sessions for the hapless . That did n't work either , though it was of benefit to the others , for they saw , seeing George , that things were not half as bad as they might be . Third , he self-medicated - with nasty medical consequences , as you might expect . Fourth , he dabbled in tantric trances , which led him , through various New Age sects and fringes , to the Open Hand , the Society of Noumenon , and finally to the Brethren , where he learned about the Cycle of Lives and the Cycle of T. He visited a tradiology lab in Pasadena and had corsai and lypnian readings taken . The needle went off the chart , the hypopsychokarmometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alabaster Kumquat Center . A full chi scoping was done . The technician shook his head and tried to smile , unsuccessfully , as he told George the bad news . In Ancient Egypt , as a purveyor , George had cynically and sycophantically supplied the reigning pharaoh with chariots , thereby making possible the pursuit of the children of Israel , which in turn led to the Lord 's intervention at the Red Sea , the limitations of Mount Sinai , the misbehavior of Ring David , the ache of the Diaspora , and the sentimentality of Steven Spielberg . On a leaf in pre-Columbian Chile , as a katydid , George had roughly elbowed aside an aphid , which led by a clear and uncontestable chain of cause and effect to the cup of hemlock that killed Socrates , the earthquake of Lisbon , and the reelection of Richard Milhaus Nixon . In Ghent , as a brick , George allowed himself to be hurled , during a civil disturbance , at a stained-glass window . The brick unfortunately missed the window and instead brained young Felton de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , he would have been , had that most precious golden bowl of his skull ( Ecclesiastes 12:6 ) not been broken . In a field on an island in the Timor Sea , as a donkey , George committed an unspeakable act on a blind horse , which led , incredibly yet verily , to the Enola Gay . In Trondheim , as a guard dog , George looked the other way , allowing the theft of hush-hush electronics that , in renegade hands , retrochronally led to the sinking of Atlantis , the dieout of the dinosaurs , and - earlier and with ever-increasing momentum - the destruction of Calyx , hands down the loveliest planet in the Solar System , leaving an unsightly and unsafe swath of rubble between the paths of what are now Mars and Jupiter . In Ilium , as a woman , George plunged two nations into a long and costly war ( forget the Nicean barks of yore ) by shamelessly leaving her husband to run off with a man half her age . And so on . " So what am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill in his gut . " You have to pay it back , " answered the tradiologist . " Like everyone else . " " How do I do that ? " The technician 's mouth made a sour twist . " The usual way . " " By taking my lumps , " said George . " That 's right . " So George became one of us , arrived at the Mount of Miracles , removed his shoes , was shorn , and did the hairshirt thing . Along with the others , he struck his forehead sixty-four times a day on the cold cobbles by the Well of Woe , chanting the extremely tedious Litany of Loss and Lack . He was an inspiration to us all . His t increased . If only Lily Lu , in a moment of idle curiosity between customers , had n't looked him up on Google . You might ask what a lowly monk would be doing on Google and how he could be found anyway if his name had been changed . But Google is everywhere now , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell you a story , but that would be another story . She came and plucked him from the Spiral Path as one plucks a sloe from a roadside bush or as one plucks out an eye ( Matthew 5:29 ) . The Brethren could do naught , stunned by her insouciant beauty and canopious panoply of t . The abbot himself , Brother Junco , was so smitten by the vision of her that he left the order and became yet another absinthe-swilling puppet performance artist in the underbelly of London . George - Brother Anselm - found himself plunged into a bath of sheer , unmitigated bliss . He was a multimillionaire overnight . His leprosy cleared up . Ditto his buboes , hammertoes , and other infirmities too embarrassing to mention . His teeth whitened without a whitener . He became fit , buff , leonine . Back in the States , married to Lily , he discovered a cure for ADD and ALS , put the Ozarks back on its feet economically , definitively solved the traffic problem in downtown Boston , appeared on Oprah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected mayor , governor , senator , president , all in a blink . You see the problem : his multigenerational debt of t unpaid . He saw the problem too , left Washington , and went back to sackcloth and ashes ( Esther 4:1 ) . But to no avail : Lily Lu 's love made him prosper in all things , like Brewster and the millions except raised to a power of ten . If he fasted , for example , his t made him pulse in the dark like a star , and pilgrims came to worship and reporters flocked from every corner to record the halo phenomenon digitally . It was said that frankincense and myrrh filled the air about him ( Matthew 2:11 ) . Many swore they heard seraphic hosannahs chanted above him . Or , if he took on City Hall and spoke out against entrenched injustice , such as health insurance and hospital billing - surely an impossible tilting at windmills that had to end in his humiliation - lo , the despised practice was overturned as if by magic , and reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he cared for the disgustingly terminal , behold , they were healed and even attractive . Mortification provided photo ops to an extent that paled even the luster of Mother Teresa . Realizing at last that his great t was really his great t , because of his great t and Lily 's great t , he decided , in despair , to end it all . Sobbing , he hanged himself , using the strap of an old douche bag . Newsof his death precipitated Kurdish independence , peace in the Middle East , and the world 's resolve to rely no longer on fossil fuels . He was canonized instantly . Apotheosized . Deified . And that is why we at the Mount of Miracles all wear this ugly gray rubber device around our neck . It is to honor and commemorate our latter-day deliverer . Yes , perhaps now you have guessed : Brother Anselm was none other than - blessed be his name - George Cumby . Thus were success and failure in life joined in extreme and unholy union . I shudder to think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our most wretched Brother Anselm . Is he a tapeworm now ? A maggot ? A truculent ball of snot in the trunk of a bilious bull elephant ? Or worse ? Lily Lu , you ask ? After the funeral , she dropped out of sight and was never heard from again . My own theory is that she returned to the place that is her true home , not the casino but the plane of sulfur and tooth gnashing ( Luke 13:28 ) , the pit of pandemonium , the sink of Sheol , the toils of Tophet ( 2 Kings 23:10 ) - because surely , for all her beauty , she was none other than the Crooked and Cloven One .
