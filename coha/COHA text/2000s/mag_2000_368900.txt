In 1979 Johnny Paul Penry forced himself into the the house of East Texas homemaker Pamela Moseley Carpenter , 22 , raped her , beat her and fatally stabbed her . Before she died , she managed to describe her killer to police . Penry later confessed to the murder . Last Thursday he was scheduled to die by lethal injection . That would hardly be a rare occurrence in the state of Texas : Penry , 44 , would have been the 38th man executed in Texas this year , a record for a single state since authorities began keeping track in 1930 . But less than four hours before he was scheduled to die , the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of execution . The reason the Justices took that rare step concerns issues surrounding Penry 's mental retardation . <P> With an IQ that has been tested between 53 and 60 ( an IQ of 70 is considered the threshold of mental retardation ) , Penry reportedly spends his days drawing with crayons and looking at comic books , since he can not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade by his mother , who , according to relatives and a former neighbor , habitually beat Penry on the head with a belt buckle , locked him indoors for prolonged periods and made him drink his own urine . At 12 , he was sent to a state school for the mentally retarded . In a recent interview with the New York Times , Penry spoke of his belief in Santa Claus . <P> Penry stands at the center of a debate that bedevils even some supporters of the death penalty : Should the state execute people who have committed brutal acts but have the mentality of children ? " While no one minimizes the severity of the crime , " Penry 's attorney , Robert Smith , wrote in his appeal to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles , " because of his mental retardation and family background , it is not possible that Johnny Paul Penry is among the most culpable offenders for whom the ultimate punishment is reserved . " <P> Of the 38 states that allow the death penalty , 13 bar the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal inmates . In 1989 the Supreme Court ruled that while executing those with diminished mental capabilities does not violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment , a defendant 's IQ and background are mitigating factors that should be considered by a jury when deciding punishment . It was , in fact , Penry 's first scheduled execution that precipitated the landmark decision . The high court concluded that the jury in Penry 's original 1980 conviction had not been asked to consider his mental capabilities when deciding on punishment . The court sent the case back to Texas , where Penry was once again convicted and sentenced to death . His lawyers contend that in the second trial , jury members did not get clear instructions to evaluate his mental maturity . <P> By intervening , the Supreme Court deflected the case from the desk of Texas Governor George W. Bush  --  who , if Penry 's appeal had failed , would have been asked by Penry 's lawyers to issue a 30-day reprieve , the strongest step the Governor can take under Texas law . Bush refused such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver David Cruz , was put to death .
