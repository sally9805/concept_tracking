Tennessee was supposed to be a national model for welfare reform . And so it was until the state ran into a basic truth about putting poor people to work : You ca n't reform welfare if you do n't have good day care . So the story of Tennessee 's success in one area  --  62% of its welfare recipients have moved into jobs  --  is also the story of its struggle in another . It is a story of day-care warehouses ' stockpiling kids and sucking in rich government subsidies while paying barely trained caregivers less than $12,000 a year . It 's a story of thousands of meals for poor kids paid for by the government but never provided ; a story of prominent politicians and church leaders with ties to the day-care industry repeatedly ignoring the headlines ; a story of children dying in overheated vans . <P> Last month Tennessee at last reformed its reform , adopting the most sweeping changes in child care in state history . But that move came with a hard lesson : money without oversight and accountability may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start that providing day care took cash , so welfare parents received vouchers , paid for by state and federal money , covering tuition at about 70% of Tennessee 's day-care centers ( as much as $85 a week for a child under two ) . To meet the demand of a welfare population going to work , Tennessee made it relatively easy to open centers , did n't require background checks or training for caregivers before they started work and mandated a higher ratio of children to staff than state experts recommended . <P> The day-care explosion hit Memphis hard . About 9,000 children in Shelby County ( which includes Memphis ) received subsidized care before welfare reform ; by 1999 , the number was 21,000 . Centers relying on those $85-a-week kids could soon be found on almost every corner of the inner city . For a few local entrepreneurs , it was a windfall . For example , Koinonia Child Care Center , run by the Rev. Roosevelt Joyner , has doubled in size since reform and today receives more than $1.7 million a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of minority people who would not ordinarily go into business into business . " <P> In June 1997 , the Work ' N ' Play Day Care Center moved into what had been a car dealership in East Memphis to accommodate its growing size . The new location was close to the home of Adrian and Tomeka Williams , who were looking for day care for two-year-old Adrian Jr . and four-month-old Destiny . On June 25 , less than a week after the center opened , the van driver unloaded the other kids for the day but left Destiny in the van . She was discovered 5 1/2 hours later , still strapped into her child seat . The temperature inside the van had reached 112degrees ; Destiny died of massive swelling of the brain caused by heat stroke . <P> State officials can not recall anything like this ever happening before in Tennessee . Parents who had been quietly questioning the quality of care now wanted answers and changes . But day-care operators with powerful allies in the state legislature argued that this was an isolated incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would put centers out of business . Nothing happened . " Everybody had something to say , " notes Tomeka Williams , who still watches the van in which her daughter died drive by each morning , " but nothing was done . "
