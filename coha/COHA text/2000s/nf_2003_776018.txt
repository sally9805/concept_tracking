" He Disclosed His Whole Heart to Me " : Lincoln and Joshua F. Speed // The first time Lincoln met Joshua Speed was on April 15 , 1837 . Admitted to the bar just six weeks earlier , he rented a horse , thrust all his belongings into the saddlebags , and rode into Springfield from New Salem , ready to begin a new phase of his life . Speed later told of their meeting so many times that he could repeat it by rote : Lincoln came into the general store of Bell &amp; Co. , on the courthouse square , to price the furnishings for a single bed - mattress , sheets , blankets , and pillow . Speed , who was part owner of the store , took out his slate and calculated the cost at $17.00. // Lincoln said , " It is probably cheap enough ; but ... I have not the money to pay . But if you will credit me until Christmas , and my experiment here as a lawyer is a success , I will pay you then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If I fail in that I will probably never be able to pay you at all . " // Moved by his visitor 's melancholy , Speed suggested a solution : " I have a very large room , and a very large double-bed in it ; which you are perfectly welcome to share with me if you choose . " // " Where is your room ? " Lincoln asked . // " Up stairs , " replied Speed , pointing to the stairway that led from the store . // Without saying a word , Lincoln picked up his saddlebags , went upstairs , set them on the floor , and came down , his face beaming , and announced : " Well Speed I 'm moved . " // I // This charming story , which Speed recounted over and over again in the years after Lincoln 's assassination , has been repeated by nearly every Lincoln biographer , and it is essentially correct . But a little background information is needed to explain why a Springfield merchant should offer to share his bed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // First , as Speed told his friend Cassius M. Clay , his initial conversation with Lincoln was a good deal more extensive . As Speed gave the price of the mattress , the blankets , and the other furnishings , Lincoln walked around the store with him , inspecting each item , and making a memorandum of the cost . In the course of their conversation , Lincoln explained that he had recently been admitted to the bar and had come to Springfield to become John Todd Stuart 's partner . He hoped to fit up a small law office and adjacent sleeping room . Indeed , he had already contracted with a local carpenter to build him a single bedstead. // What is more important for understanding the story , it was probably true that Lincoln had not met Speed up to this point , but the storekeeper knew perfectly well who Lincoln was and , indeed , had a good deal of information about him . Speed had heard Lincoln speak in a celebrated 1836 debate in Springfield . He was so effective that George Forquer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the Democrats and had been appointed register of the Land Office as a reward , felt it necessary to take Lincoln down , ridiculing him in every way he could . Lincoln , in reply , referred to the lightning rod Forquer had just erected over his splendid Springfield house and told the audience : " I would rather die now , than , like the gentleman change my politics , and simultaneous with the change , receive an office worth three thousand dollars per year , and then have to erect a lightning-rod over my house , to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God . " Speed must also have known that Lincoln had served two terms in the Illinois state legislature and was one of the most prominent Whig politicians in the state . // Even so , the two young men were not personally acquainted when they first met. // II // Initially , Speed and Lincoln seemed to be unlikely friends . Lincoln was twenty-eight . Speed , who was born in 1814 , was five years younger . Slim and trim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disfiguring whiskers , a handsome face with regular features . The son of a wealthy Kentucky planter , he had been brought up at Farmington , one of the great historic houses of Kentucky , just outside Louisville . A member of a large and caring family , he revered his father , adored his mother , and was fondly affectionate to his numerous brothers and sisters . Carefully educated at the best private schools in the West , he had attended St. Joseph 's College in Bardstown for a while before he decided to make his own way in the world . After clerking in a large Louisville store for two or three years , he set out in 1835 for Springfield , where he bought a part interest in the general store of Bell &amp; Co . Though far from Kentucky , he kept up an affectionate correspondence with his father and mother , writing them regularly and informing them , in his somewhat heavy-handed style , that " nothing gives me more pleasure than a consciousness that I have done nothing to forfeit the love or esteem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thin and gaunt , and he was still very rough in dress and appearance . He brought to his friendship with Speed no record of distinguished ancestry , no history of education and polish . He had nothing to offer except innate good manners , an eager desire to please , and a sensitivity to the needs of others . Both men were drivingly ambitious - Speed for wealth and comfort , Lincoln for fame . // For the next four years , Speed and Lincoln slept in the same bed , above the general store on the town square in Springfield . From time to time , they shared the big room above the store with Billy Herndon , who clerked for Speed , and with Charles Hurst , who also worked in the store . But much of the time , they were alone . The arrangement put Lincoln in closer contact with another person than any he had ever experienced . // As Lincoln settled in , he charmed Speed and his clerks with his endless fund of anecdotes , and , as the word spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks - began to gather in Speed 's store after hours , clustering around the big stove to listen to Lincoln 's tales and jokes . They met so regularly that Speed called the group " a social club without organization . " Soon the members began presenting their own stories and poems for criticism , and they engaged in informal debates . // When the stove grew cold and the other men went home , Speed and Lincoln were left together , to talk endlessly about everything . They discussed books and literature . Lincoln loved Shakespeare and Burns , some of whose poems he could recite from memory , while Speed favored the poetry of Lord Byron . They both had a taste for melancholy - one might say morbid - verse and liked to quote William Knox 's " Oh , Why Should the Spirit of Mortal Be Proud ? " At the same time they both had a lively sense of humor . Lincoln in these early years was given to burlesque , and his endless anecdotes always had a point ; Speed 's humor tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Springfield and central Illinois . In 1841 , when Speed was out of town , Lincoln sent him a long letter detailing the alleged murder of one Archibald Fisher , who lived in Warren County . The case fascinated Lincoln - the fuller account that he prepared five years later revealed that Fisher was not murdered after all - and he was so sure that Speed shared all his interests that he minutely described the investigation for his friend . // Much of the time , Lincoln and Speed talked politics ; they were ardent anti-Jacksonians and supporters of Henry Clay . Complaining of the " trained bands " of Democrats , so well organized that they carried election after election , they signed and helped distribute an 1840 campaign circular announcing that the Whig Committee , to which they both belonged , planned " to organize the whole State , so that every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming presidential contest . " They discussed at length the value of internal improvements - the building of canals and railroads with government funds - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor of New York who was responsible for the completion of the Erie Canal , Lincoln , usually so reticent about his political goals , confided to his friend that " his highest ambition was to become the De Witt Clinton of Ills . " // But mostly they talked about themselves . Analyzing his roommate , Lincoln concluded that he was " naturally of a nervous temperament , " which , he judged from Speed 's confidences , he probably inherited from his mother . For his part , Speed noted both the kindness of Lincoln 's heart and his " nervous sensibility . " Once he remarked that Lincoln 's mind was " a wonder , " because impressions were easily made upon it and were never erased . " No , " replied Lincoln , " you are mistaken - I am slow to learn and slow to forget .... My mind is like a piece of steel , very hard to scratch any thing on it and almost impossible after you get it there to rub it out . " Summarizing their friendship after Lincoln 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He disclosed his whole heart to me. " // III // Inevitably questions arise about the nature of this friendship and the influence that it had on Lincoln . Lincoln 's letters to Speed in 1842 and 1843 ( Speed 's letters for these years have unfortunately been lost ) make it clear that the two young men shared their most personal feelings , especially about courtship and marriage . It may well be true that , as Lincoln 's official biographers , John G. Nicolay and John Hay , asserted , Speed was " the only - as he was certainly the last - intimate friend that Lincoln ever had . " But Speed himself was careful to make no great claims that he influenced Lincoln 's ideas or policies . After Lincoln 's death , he explicitly denied reports that he had helped draft some of Lincoln 's speeches , and when Herndon questioned him , he made it clear that he saw the President infrequently during the Civil War years and did not think of himself as a White House intimate . Herndon 's verdict on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln " poured out his soul to Speed , " he correctly pointed out that Speed had little , if any , influence on Lincoln 's political views . Scornfully , he added that " except in his love scrapes " - in which Speed had been a willing co-conspirator - " Lincoln never poured out his soul to any mortal creature . " // Recently , another question has been raised : Was the close relationship between Lincoln and Speed a homosexual one ? Or , since the word homosexual did not come into use until the 1870s , could it be called a " homoerotic " one ? To be blunt , did they have sex together ? It was not until the gay liberation movement that these subjects began to be discussed , and with increasing frankness . On a publicity tour that I undertook in 1995-1996 to promote my biography of Lincoln , I was astonished to discover the question most frequently asked was whether Lincoln was gay . The subject deserves careful and cautious discussion . // First , it ought to be noted that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Speed . Herndon , who sometimes slept in the same upstairs room over Speed 's store , never mentioned the possibility , though he discussed at length his ideas about Lincoln 's sexual interests in women . Charles Hurst , another of Speed 's clerks , who also slept in the room , never referred to any sexual or even physical intimacy between the two men . Though nearly every other possible charge against Lincoln was raised during his long public career - from his alleged illegitimacy to his possible romance with Ann Rutledge , to the breakup of his engagement to Mary Todd , to some turbulent aspects of their marriage - no one ever suggested that he and Speed were sexual partners . // In these still primitive , almost frontier , days in Illinois , it was anything but uncommon for two or more men to share a bed . Space was at a premium , and privacy was not much valued or expected . Unmarried men who worked on farms , or in livery stables , or in country stores regularly slept in the same beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing a bed with other guests . Even when respectable lawyers rode the circuit , traveling from county seat to county seat , they tumbled unceremoniously into bed together . There was no sexual implication in these sleeping arrangements . // Of course , both Lincoln and Speed knew that men did sometimes have sex with each other . They had only to read the Bible to be aware of that . In his Indiana years , Lincoln wrote a scurrilous poem , " The Chronicles of Reuben , " in which he ridiculed a neighbor he did not like and claimed that , unable to find a wife , he wed another man . But such relationships were not merely infrequent ; they were against the law . There were surprisingly few legal cases involving what was called " sodomy , " " the crime against nature , " or - where an animal was a party - " buggery . " Jonathan Ned Katz has made a careful search of all the appeals cases heard during the nineteenth century by the high courts of twenty-five states and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have concerned what we call homosexual activity . Only two of these were in Illinois . // During the first half of the nineteenth century , close relations between a man and a woman prior to , or outside of , marriage were frowned on , but intimacies between two people of the same sex - especially if they were young - were readily tolerated . There are a surprising number of well-documented cases of love among young men . Young Ralph Waldo Emerson nearly swooned with passion over Martin Gay , whom he thought the most handsome student at Harvard College , but he was too inhibited to make his love known . Daniel Webster was deeply in love with James Hervey Bingham , a classmate at Dartmouth , with whom he continued on intimate terms long after graduation . He addressed Bingham as " Dearly Beloved , " and ended his letters with affectionate phrases like : " Accept all the tenderness I have . D. Webster . " The letters between such male lovers are full of references to sleeping together , kisses , caresses , and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these were erotic relationships , but with rare exceptions , they do not appear to have been sexual relationships . // The Lincoln-Speed connection did not fall even into that category . Nearly all of the documented erotic relationships between males were between young men - in effect , boys who had reached the peak of their physical powers but were far from ready to assume the role of husband and breadwinner . In contrast , when Lincoln and Speed came together in 1837 , neither was a youth : Lincoln was twenty-eight years old and Speed was twenty-three . //
