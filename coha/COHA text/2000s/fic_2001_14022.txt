Black soup of night.A thousand glitter lights spread across the vast distance but they are NOT stars.They 're the lights of Los Angeles.Strip malls . Police chopper beams . Freeway clog.High on a ridge , above it all , a man , CHICK , and a woman , LU , sit in a car.Keeping a sharp lookout on the darkness . CHICK So that 's pretty much all there is to it . LU That 's not much . CHICK Rarely is . LU So , just take notes , huh ? CHICK Keep an eye out for  --  yeah . Take notes . If you see any , whattya call em , if you see patterns .

I 'm not real . CHICK Whatever . LU Right . Whatever . Chick shuts the car door.Pulls his jacket collar up , covering his face.And slouches down the hill. @x Lu , in the car . Staring out into the night through huge binoculars.She stares out through the front window . The side.The other side.There is nothing but blackness . Vague unmoving shadows . Silence . On the ridge above , a figure emerges in the darkness.It is DAWN.She looks out into the night through binoculars.Then trains them on Lu in the car.Watches as Lu stares at civilization below.Dawn walks off into the night . Lu stares out the car windshield.She trains the binoculars on the dashboard.The steering wheel . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . Immediately the night is filled with sound.The amazing sound of night birds  --  Caws . Calls.Screeches . And complex , melodic warbled songs.Wind moves up the canyon . It whistles.Manzanita and juniper branches wave and flutter.The outpost is scented with sage . Lu lets it all wash over her.She climbs up into the canyon.She looks across the ridge , drinking it in . She makes bird sounds  --  not necessarily expertly . LU Whuh-hoo-oo-oo . Who-oo. ( beat ) Tuhhhh-wiit . Auw ! Auw ! She stamps her feet to stay awake . Hums.Hel-lllloooo ! Hello ! Hello ! Echo !

He turns and waves , heads back down the hill.I got a feeling . You 're gon na be good . He 's gone . Lu watches a moment . Climbs out of the car . p. 9 The night sounds are everywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness : " Nothingcome hereno oneit 's realmoon and nighthel-lonight songno one " Lu picks up binoculars.Aims them at a bird on a high branch.Follows it . Watches . LU Wow . A shadowy figure dressed in hiking gear , carrying a large pack , emerges almost silently through the brush.It is Dawn again.She watches Lu looking through the binoculars . DAWN What is it ? Lu freezes . In fear . And shock . DAWN Can you see it ? Lu starts to turn around.No no no ! Look at the bird ! Look at the bird ! Stay focused . If you turn to look at me , you 'll never find it again in this dark . Keep trained right on it . Do n't let it go . Lu shudders . Keeps looking through the binoculars.Is it a finch ? Blue grosbeak ? Lazuli bunting ? Lu does not turn around.She fumbles with the binoculars . LU Fuck . It 's . Too dark . DAWN There 's no moon . Not the faintest hint of stars in the sky . p. 10 LU Mush .

LU Fair is fair . I guess . She listens . Nothing . No one. @x Lu sits in the car , staring through the binoculars , out the passenger window.Chick appears behind the car . Raps on the glass on the driver 's side . Lu jumps . CHICK Got coffee ? LU Jesus . Do you always have to creep ? CHICK I 'm not creeping . Brought you some joe . It 's good stuff , not 7-11 crap .

You 're learning the job . Good . LU Thanks . CHICK Enjoy the coffee . He climbs out of the car . She watches him head away. @x Lu climbs up into the canyon.Bird songs , calls of the night.Is there anyone there ? Lu looks around . Only shadows.She sits on a boulder , stares out at the stars that are stars and the stars that are not.She stares . Not really seeing . DAWN You dreaming ? LU Huh  --  ? Wh  --  ? I 'm awake . I 'm awake . Dawn emerges from the brush . DAWN Waking or sleeping . Either way , you can d  --  LU My eyes are wide open . Lu turns to look at her . Slowly . DAWN Fine . I believe you .

And he just keeps coming at me . DAWN This person ? LU Yeah . Whatever . DAWN Someone you loved . LU So I try to get him to stop . I say , cut this shit out . He ignores me .

And his face is  --  . It 's  --  . Anyway . So now I keep my eyes open . Pictures all gone . DAWN ( beat ) It 's an incomplete message . LU Yeah . Sure . So . Big disappointment , huh ? DAWN Why would it even matter ? LU You hear infinite voices . You see a blue grosbeak , for god 's sake . And me ? Haunted by cliche-ridden nightstalkers . Up here . In this place . I 'm trivial . You can say it . I already know . Dawn looks out at night , the valley below . DAWN Coastal fog 's creeping in . LU Oh . Yeah . Can barely tell where the houses are anymore . Streetlights and cars obscured by fog . DAWN A thousand years ago it might have looked like this . LU Before people ? DAWN There were people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thousand tiny cookfires below . Little clusters of families . Secure alone . Secure knowing the smoke of the neighbors was nearby . The Chumash . The Tungva. p. 19 LU Ca n't dodge the neighbors even then , huh ? DAWN At twilight , they 'd make a silent climb up into the canyons to watch the sun dip into the sea from a worshipful vantage point . Lu squints to try to picture it . LU Umreally.where ?

Think I 'm , like , uh just brain dead ? You do , do n't you ? Dawn shrugs again . LU Well , why the fuck do I have to see anything anyway ? Know anything , get anything ? Understand anything . What 's the difference , right ? DAWN Are you asking me ? LU Nothing but fucking trouble . Saint Joan gets one of those **27;3389;TOOLONG messages from God to go and fight for the absolutely useless Dauphin , and what happens ? She just gets roasted . Santa Barbara ends up with her head on a plate . Santa Teresa , Santa Paula , Santa Monica , they 're just so damned embarrassing to everyone , with their chastity , mystic visions , their holier than holy vows . And do n't get me started on their specialties  --  Saint Anne , for God 's sake , is the patron saint of old clothes dealers . Saint Clare  --  washerwomen .

But she is gone. @x Lu is leaning against the car stretching her neck , her legs.The night is dark.No sounds.No one.She keeps stretching , trying to stay awake.Chick arrives with a bag .

You there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn.Like , my mother , for example . Married for over forty years . Does she have any idea who my father is , or what he wants ? No .

The creatures coming at me with the creepy crawlers head , with red wax candy lips . DAWN Knocking things over . LU Yeah . Yeah . DAWN Do you scream ? LU Bloodcurdling . I shriek . I holler . I  --  Yeah . Y  --  . No . No I do n't scream . I do n't . Finally  --  finally . Finally I say , wait a minute . Stop . I just get real quiet and I say : Stop . You 're dead . DAWN Just like that .

Bright blue ocean on one side . A ring of deep lapis mountains . Sage and low pine and clay in the middle . Up here  --  a reminder of what it was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a stone that 's been here as long as the stars . DAWN That 's it . LU It should stay this way forever . DAWN Yes . It should .

Hello ? Lu looks . Dawn is gone . Lu rubs her eyes.Lu heads off down the canyon. @x Lu trains her binoculars on the street below.On the canyon.On the car.On the street again.She jots down a few notes.Chick approaches , loudly coughing , making noise . LU You feeling okay ? CHICK Just wanted to give you some notice . You know . No lurking . LU Oh . Thanks . CHICK Do we have a villain yet ? LU Am I looking for a villain ? CHICK I ca n't tell you .
