Nicky licks my eyelids . He pins me down and licks my eyelids . <p> You should hear what boys call me always looking for the tongue in my mouth because my lips are the only place on me with any fat like maybe once they got bit . I 'm a small town so up go my fists and they scat . Sticks and stones , says me to their skinny shirttails , what else you got . Some words are n't worth the breath they 're made out of . I 'm a wishbone but I do n't break . There 's this calico cat who sits on the fence making faces because he 's mute . Wow goes his mouth opening and closing wow . The bluebirds bite his tail . He feels like corduroy slacks when you pet him , all the long thin veins inside him sticking out through his skin . I 'm sorry for him but still I go right up to his face when he 's clinging to the pickets his limp face like a lily pad wow I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say your other senses get really strong to compensate , there 's always this give and take , is n't there , a win and a loss , the only drawback being that you do n't get too much choice either way . <p> Who gave you the fat lip , Nicky says with a smirk . Just from that smirk you know he 's asking for it . <p> My mother buys me halter-tops in the junior department at Strawbridge 's . She says they give me a little something up top . There is something nice about the string of a halter-top softing across your bare back . You 're a late bloomer , my mother says . She does n't know about spin the bottle or seven minutes in heaven . My growing shinbones  --  the tibias , to put words in my mother 's mouth  --  hurt at night while I lie there helpless . The heart rises from a horizon crossing me sometimes it 's like a class running sprints , sometimes the only thing inside me is squeaky cleats . <p> The cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His words would rather be whistle . On a good day , you 'd swear there was a bird in the house . My dad calls me shy , but he is hello goodbye , like the sky . If I 'm ear , he 's eye . <p> Pam is a pinup before her time . She gets quieter and quieter as her body gets louder and louder . I hear it , banging like a band . She 's an easy target . Wendy and Lee-Lee and Alison and me , we 're slim as hammers , we slit our eyes and stalk the halls . We pick on Pam . It gets out of hand , I 'll be first to admit . We sneak up behind her and pluck at the stripe of her bra strap and it goes pop ! snap ! It 's like hopping down the block . We chase her into the boys ' room our hands clawing at the yellow hair flowing off her . She slides to the floor with her hands holding the edge of the sink . The principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sighs , he would n't expect this of girls . Pam walks around in a daze , her head down and her shoulders curling inward . She moves as if cupped in parentheses . This is what sticks in my mind : Pam on the tile floor of the boys ' room , Pam 's pale arms and pink freckles folding a soft X across her own self . Tears in her brown eyes . That 's my point of view . But looking at it another way , there 's me with a stringy ponytail staring down at her , and that picture is labeled with my name first and last and it 's filed in her head forever and ever . <p> You think it 's the big events that mark your life but it 's not , it 's the teensy moments that come back to haunt you . <p> Before my brother Mattie died they shaved him bald . Here he was a sorry sight coming back to school and on his scalp the blue veins showed through . At recess I pretended I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playground , shortsighted and singing I swung and swung stamping the sky . The helmet of his head glowed golden . The sun singing in your eyes . This is what happens that comes back to haunt you . <p> My other brother sees in me what the others do n't . He sees me getting away with murder . He 's sick and tired of hearing about me , the baby of the family , the princess and the pea . When my parents ' friends kiss me they leave lipstick on my cheeks . They measure my every inch because it helps them feel the flow of time and they shake their heads as if it makes them sad it might be a coincidence how they always say the same thing : oh my we 're not getting any younger are we my oh my can you believe how fast they grow ? Life is a river a sea and it 's weeping out of a tap in me . <p> Secrets do n't smoke like fire . My other brother is a building bearing down on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back . His breath butters the back of my neck . Your big brother is a bully , my mom says , but he 's just a boy . <p> This is my trick : look as if you 're having the time of your life especially if you 're not . <p> There is nothing cool about catechism class except that now they 're having us come on Tuesday afternoons we sit under the fluorescent lights with a teacher who says let 's talk about real life let 's see who would like to begin ? There 's my foot swinging off the shin there 's the twitch twitch the peek at the shiny watch face . There are the seconds saying this this who does n't ever feel that . Instantly I 'm looking around for my only friend who happens to be Nicky . You could spot our grins a mile away . A Hail Mary in my mouth I slip out the door and here he comes my friend Nicky . We sneak across the street to the supermarket and climb up for a smoke on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad view because at dusk the street suddenly blazes with lights and everywhere the sea to shining sea of cars . Cigarette smoke goes inside you like a soft mood nothing else is quite like that . Lozenge lips , he calls me and it 's no compliment . His chin has a point so sharp it could cut you . Nicky I call him but he says please call me Nick . Nick the dick , I say . His lips are sticky and stick to mine . <p> With me it 's all or nothing . Best friend or no friend at all . I shrug and say take it or leave it . They give in and you end up getting all and they get nothing . That 's the equation with me coming after the equals sign . My other brother says someday it will all catch up with me . At some point , he says , the truth will out and you will finally get what you deserve . Truth is this odd thing because most people talk about it like it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dare I pick dare every time , I 'm not giving anything away , I 'm looking out for number one . Actions are always safer than words . <p> Which is why when Nicky dares me the burned out cigarette goes in my mouth and down the hatch ash and all . It tastes like a dead leaf not that I 'd know . Which is how I ended up inside the Salvation Army dumpster and closed the door and I let myself breathe it in , the smell of people that stays in clothes and I did n't let my imagination go because it 's true that all these thrown-away things were like bodies , soft as moths . <p> He slips his clammy hand inside my halter-top and his palm holds its breath on top of my ha ha heart . <p> My other brother says my luck will run out sooner or later , he says people will wise up to my tricks . It 's his job to roughen the edges of my life , toughen me up . I watched him eating peas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the wrong tube . It was just a passing thought because right then his eyes rolled over me like I was this small stretch of sidewalk . <p> Nicky lives in a pink stucco house behind a tall black gate . Open the front door and you can almost smell the glue drying , his house is that new , the air feels wet inside it . They have plastic slipcovers on the sofas and chairs and lampshades . You have to take off your shoes inside . You have to wash your hands . It makes you feel nice and neat like the best little pieces of you come out on tiptoes . The only snacks they have are carrot sticks and tangerines . He says his mom hates him for being a pint-size version of his dad . My house is a hundred years old , which is more than most people ever dream of reaching . Maybe in its long life my house is like trees but then it might also be like stone . <p> I 'm not one to brood on the bad , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my mom has the bright idea to beat this thing into the ground . It 's called a year without my brother Mattie . I sit down to write and this is what comes to mind . The summer of the Japanese beetles . They swarm in the leaves buzzing like bees and feasting on the trees . They float like black bullets in the pool . I 'm on the diving board , my arms in an X across my chest like Ultraman . He 's in the shallow end , he Ultramans me , his arms crossed over ridges of ribs , the gleam of the sun on his shaved head . His head is a polished skull atop the crossbones of his arms . I smack my feet hard on the gritty board and fling myself into the air . The water shatters as I hit the surface and fall through , and fall , thorns of ice raking my skin , the only way I can share it with him the scalpels flashing silver blades inside his brain scooping and scraping and leaving him hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , when you wo n't let a thing be , when you worry about who what why when . <p> Japanese beetles and gypsy moths . Both at the same time . Who would think it possible , Dad says , what are the chances of two blights at once ? When it rains it pours , he sighs . <p> I did n't learn the brain when we studied it in school maybe it was too close to home . On the screen it looked like egg pie served up on plates as you went past the gray matter and got into the ganglion . I got up to go to the bathroom because I felt sick but I just stood and stared down into the toilet while it flushed and imagined millions of neurons and all those sparks and how your head is a bowl and what 's it holding but this huge soup you call a soul . <p> Nicky flicks off the basement light and we go up the steps holding hands . His clammy hands . He turns around at the top and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart peeping at my cheek , he holds me to him and something in me is a wave before it breaks . His parents talking in the kitchen , his mom says , You 're pathetic you 're a worm . Her heels click on the hard floor . You 're over the hill , she says and she clicks into view through the crack and we huddle hidden watching her flash her hands in his dad 's face . Nicky shivers in my arms . I can see his dad has already lost , she is sharpened , she 'll slash him to shreds , her heels her fingernails the edge of her lips . But he does it anyway , he drops to his knees in front of her , he kneels before her and embraces her legs , he presses his face to her skirt . He cries at her crotch . Lo siento , he says . Lo siento . He slides to her feet and she steps out of him , she lifts her heels one by one and leaves him on the floor like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands of hair on handpainted Mexican tile . She licks a finger and smooths a curl off her forehead , click click her heels . <p> In the coils of Nicky 's black hair I see the swish of a slinky sliding down some steps . I wish I had hair like that , I say . He sponges black shoe polish on my head , it feels like soggy paws padding across my scalp . My hair turns into greasy tar and Nicky is in hysterics . I laugh with him , I can laugh at myself , and pretty soon he 's smudging his fingerprints on my arms and cheeks and down my spine . Because his skin almost glows because he comes from an island because I am ashamed of how my hands sometimes look so white and drained of life because he is so full sometimes I feel scrawny and thin . <p> His front tooth is chipped . You can see the tip of his tongue through the opening . It makes his smile look untidy without your knowing exactly why . His jeans torn just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows a scrap of thigh the size of an eye . <p> This is one thing leading to another . My other brother found me looking for the girls under his mattress and is thinking up a way to make me pay . Back massages are only the beginning . The hot of his hands like sun . The way you chap and crack . <p> This is what Dad says the summer of the Japanese beetles and the gypsy moths . He says our hair is clogging up the filters and from now on bathing caps are rule number one . <p> Shoes lined up on the mat inside the door except for hers , she keeps her high heels on because they are clean . In his room we can hear her move and move the cool smooth sound of her shoes click click click on marble and parquet and Mexican tile . She 's trapped , he says , listen to her pace back and forth . <p> A net of crickets surging against the stone walls of my house . It is already tomorrow when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb the stairs whispering . Their door shuts softly . Darkness is a draft breathing through my room . Crickets swell and subside , swell and subside . Prayers help push off an accidental death while you swim through sleep . Someone can hear your every thought . If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take . Souls are icy stars crucified on the night sky . <p> His dad gives Nicky a turtle . He says my son needs company and all the better if it 's not human company . In my country , he adds with a little wink , la tortuga makes good soup . Let 's split , Nicky says , before we get the recipe in Spanish . The turtle has stringy legs and webbed feet . You ca n't make him come out until he 's good and ready , Nicky says , he 's safe and sound inside his shell , he 's a tiny turtle tank . A hammer could crack it open , I say trying to make him laugh . His bangs fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to copy but mine wo n't budge . The turtle pushes out a telescoping head slim as a pinky finger , it paddles across his palm jerking side to side like a puppet on strings . <p> The gypsy moths spin thick cocoons in the trees , the branches are dipped in cotton candy . Our heads are pinched in tight elastic caps , our skulls are smooth bulbs planted in the pool , our bodies dangling underwater like spindly roots . <p> Pam was pink her skin was pink we called her spam . <p> This is the sound of the gypsy moth summer : sprinklers spraying silvery jump ropes of water across the lawn , a pulsing sst sst sst sst . I hide under the pine tree , the branches so long and thick they drape to the ground . Carpenter ants come crawling up my ankles . It 's called putting things in perspective , but I never seem to fit . I 'm not sticking around the sick . I am saying this all the time now : why should I stick around the sick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is flying . I ca n't keep my mouth shut . I ca n't stand anybody sick . Pine needles are gummy in my fingers and peppery in my mouth . Black charred branches creak and sigh and needles fall and fall and I think about ticks and Rocky Mountain spotted fever , ticks rain on my head , small sharp thumbtacks sticking to my scalp and sickening my blood . You 'll be singing the song of sorry , my other brother says , for the rest of your long and selfish life . <p> We 're eating eyeballs in the wine cellar . When you are in my house because it is at the very end of a long and winding lane and because it is big and you are down in the deep ground it is easy to believe that everything lived is quickly lost . Out comes Nicky 's tongue past the crooked teeth to show me a cocktail onion sitting there like a pearl . In some countries tongue is a good and rare thing to eat which is probably why it 's usually so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to say okay Nicky now put it away please and in my chest I started feeling those fast fast feet . <p> Dad drives the lawnmower , he lets me ride shotgun . We drive across the lawn , blades chopping beneath us and clouds of grass spitting a wake behind us . He switches gears on the turn and we lurch and tilt and I yell , ca n't we go faster , and he holds the shift in his hand and I 'm bouncing beside him holding on with both hands in a hive of grass clippings , a hive of green and whining saws . When I slide down at the end my knees are elastic , the ground swings like a clothesline , I look up at him and see the pulse in his neck , bits of grass on his face . He surveys the cropped lawn and he does n't smile but somehow you know he is pleased in a quiet way and his gaze is a hand smoothing across the silky short grass feeling the life pushing crisply against his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicky on his hands and knees in the azalea bushes , dirt on his face and his hair a frenzy . She killed it , he says , she killed it and buried it . He 's holding his turtle to his chest and crying ; she 's in butterscotch suede , a shine on her skin and mascara blotting around the eyes , and for a second she looks like him something scared or hurting in the eyes , and then she looks at me , she glances at my hightop sneakers , she says , Would you like a tangerine while Nicky has his tantrum ? And she turns , she glides inside the house like an eel the way she moves through life . I feel pulled two ways at once , Nicky sobbing on his knees , his mom gliding inside the house . Maybe he knows it because he looks at me and stops crying long enough to say , Get out of here . All I can think about is his wormy turtle half-decomposed . You should n't dig up the dead , I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is my dad : he scoops up the earth in his hand and sifts it through his fingers . He sees the small signs of disease , a ragged hedge , a torn petal , he will turn a leaf over and read it like a palm . Look there , he says and the sadness in his voice makes me freeze . Aphids , he says pinching off a leaf here a leaf there . <p> This is my mom : she shucks the corn peeling back the stiff leafy sheaves , yanking off the yellow silk . She flicks the worms into the trash . She peels the potatoes and gouges out the eyes . <p> After dinner Dad sits back and lights a cigar . Well that hit the spot , he says with a big smile and you can feel the fullness in the kitchen and Mom finally sits down still and drinks some herbal tea and he looks at me and says , Did n't that hit the spot ? and he looks at Mom , Was n't that something , he says blowing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the next and best course . Oh , she says squirting lemon into her tea , that was nothing at all . <p> This is to show how somethings can be made of nothings . His smoke rings spin silver blue halos for our centerpiece . <p> Next time I 'll get a snapping turtle , he says . He snips off the heads of his mother 's tulips with sharp scissors . Flowers fall with soft thuds like falling fruit . Red and yellow flowers , waxy as crayons , firm and fleshy . Snapping turtle , he says , snap snap snap , scissoring the thick stems . He picks them up and crushes them in his fist . He smells the crushed petals . He licks a red scrap and it sticks to his tongue . A plastic bag fills with crushed tulip heads . He hands it to me and pulls the cuff of his sweatshirt over his hand like a mitt , he polishes the vases . Do n't run with scissors , he says , she told me never to run with scissors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up stabbed through the heart . Sawed-off stems in vases , I feel a shimmer in the mirror and I look up and see us reflected there , he 's behind me , and the mirror is smoky as if the glass has been rubbed with a damp rag or an eraser , he 's standing behind me a beam of sunlight on his head , white teeth in a grin , scissor blades slashing . He puts his arms around me and he bites my neck and whispers , I want to suck your blood , scissor tips sticking into my belly , his breath spilling milkily inside my ear . <p> My other brother talks about me as if I 'm not there . He says to my dad , Do you think she should be spending so much time with Nicky ? My dad sips his vodka on the rocks . You can smell the hot jalapeno peppers splitting open in my mother 's spaghetti sauce . My other brother takes a whiff and looking at my dad he asks me this : And where exactly does Nicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? On my bedroom door late at night my other brother 's knuckles go knock knock . I do n't remember before the backrubs I do n't know how a girl gets unbent sometimes it makes me sick just watching my family eat . <p> This is the end of summer number one . This is the end of a year without my brother Mattie . I am getting closer to his eyes . His eyelashes are long and when they flicker they leave purple stains like bruises . <p> I hear it from my mom but she is n't talking to me , she sighs and I hear a sizzle of butter in the frying pan and I hear her telling my dad , I hear her say , Nicky stuck a fork into an electric outlet , I hear her voice and the exhaust fan ticking in the background and a highball glass set down on the countertop , What , Dad says , her little friend Nicky ? <p> I stand on top of the fence . I hold my arms up , I close my eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump into the leaf pile . I fall into a soft bed of rotting leaves and I feel my life taking a deep breath and I 'm inside it and all I can hear is the crinkling and crackling of dead leaves and the thump of my life going on and on and on . <p> I dream him charred and sooty like the branches of the pine tree , the hole of his mouth and the chipped front tooth . The sockets of his eyes . <p> When I hopped in the front seat the door closed on my rabbit coat and what I said was Fuck I felt her hit the brakes and my body went bump my mother said what did you say ? I could n't see through her black sunglasses but I pretended I could and aimed a long honest gaze into the place where she might have eyes . Luck , I lied , I was praying for the Irish luck you 're not supposed to listen . I was thinking how my rabbit coat was almost alive the fur came up to pet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just once he calls , he says hi and I say hi and then I hear him breathing . I 'm going away to school , he says , and my mom 's going to live in France . I 'm going to military academy , he says and I hear him breathing . I imagine the hair burnt off his arms . Oh , I say . My dad 's selling the house , he says , I might not ever be back . I do n't know what to say to somebody who stuck a fork in an electric outlet . Some people are magnets for bad luck , he says and I hear him breathe in deep . I bite off my thumbnail and this is when I understand that I suck up the luck from everybody around me and leave them the bad . Well bye , he says and cuts the connection and I hold on thinking he 'll pick up one two three four five seconds I count and I 'm still breathing through the wires down the street and up the hill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause  --  as if there 's a turning place in every moment where it can go one of two ways  --  before the line goes dead and the smallest something in you goes quiet and lazy and flies off like a flea . <p> <p> By Carol Fitzgerald <p>
