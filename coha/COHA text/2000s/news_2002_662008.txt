<p> Larry Wayne Harris stands in his second bedroom holding a rack of test tubes . <p> " These are the active cultures that I use , " he says proudly , ticking off the contents of each glass vial . " Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococcus , E. coli , Bacillus cereus . <p> " Also , if I need it ... " he adds , squeezing between the bed and a chest of drawers . <p> Harris pulls a vial out of a dormitory-size refrigerator and holds it between his thumb and forefinger . He peers at it though his reading glasses , his Santa Claus beard spreading across his chest like a bib . <p> It is anthrax , albeit a harmless form used for inoculating livestock against the disease . <p> " It can not make you sick , nor can it be made to make you sick , " Harris says reassuringly . <p> There is nothing about Harris ' small wood-frame house , neatly planted in a modest suburban neighborhood of minivans and chain-link fences , to suggest the presence of live anthrax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just a few scientific accouterments , none very sophisticated . His lab bench is an old bedroom vanity . His supply closet is an armoire . The centrifuge on the dresser might look familiar to anybody who took high school biology in the 1950s . <p> This cramped home lab could never produce anything like the high-grade anthrax that started turning up at news organizations and in Capitol Hill mailboxes this fall . <p> Even so , federal agents investigating the mail attacks have taken a keen interest in Harris and anybody remotely like him . An FBI profile in November described a loner with " access to some laboratory equipment " who " has a scientific background to some extent , or at least a strong interest in science . " <p> That 's Harris . And to a greater or lesser extent , the FBI profile describes a suprisingly robust network of people like him . <p> These are citizen-scientists who conduct their experiments outside of the big institutions - universities , pharmaceutical companies and government laboratories - that control biological research today . They vary greatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some do n't have college degrees ; others have Ph.D.s and experience directing university laboratories . <p> Some perform their experiments in basements , spare bedrooms and rented offices in suburban office parks . They use secondhand equipment , modified kitchenware , whatever they can scrounge up with their own money or donations . <p> A select few have their own research institutes , and in some cases they have even attracted federal funding by circumventing the process the government uses to dole out research money . But their theories and goals are dismissed , and sometimes even discredited , by the scientific establishment . <p> It was n't always this way . For centuries , amateur investigators were the backbone of science . The founder of microbiology , Anton van Leeuwenhoek , was a Dutch fabric salesman who enjoyed making optical instruments out of glass lenses that he ground himself . One of his inventions was the first microscope . He used it to explore previously unimagined worlds in drops of pond water , leaves , even his own body fluids . In plaque taken from the mouths of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animalcules . ... All the water ... seemed to be alive . " <p> Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria . It was 1683 . <p> More than three centuries later , the opportunities for a lone , untrained amateur to make a major discovery appear to be long gone . Now that the basic discoveries have been made , it takes millions , or even billions , of dollars to pursue unanswered questions such as mapping the human genome . Science has grown so big that even the most revered Nobel Prize winner is only a small part of an enormous research establishment <p> Still , the do-it-yourselfers persist . Some have dreams of miracle cures and billion-dollar patents . Others pursue wild conspiracy theories . A few , including Harris , have even dabbled in chemical or biological weapons . <p> He once tried to use somebody else 's credentials to mail-order the organism that causes bubonic plague . He said he needed the bacteria to do research for his book , a guide to biological warfare defense . <p> Harris might have succeeded if he had n't called the biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The employee who took his call at the American Tissue and Culture Collection in Rockville , Md. , became suspicious and notified authorities . The day after the bacteria arrived at Harris ' Ohio home , so did a swarm of federal agents . He eventually pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced to 18 months of probation . <p> The incident also got Harris kicked out of the American Society for Microbiology ( which does n't require academic credentials for membership . ) He is the only person ever expelled by the organization . <p> Three years later , Harris was involved in another dustup with federal officials . In February 1998 , federal agents learned that he was in Las Vegas , proclaiming that he had enough anthrax to wipe out the entire city . The FBI arrested Harris and William Job Leavitt , another amateur scientist , and towed Leavitt 's Mercedes off in a sheath of plastic . <p> Officials later determined that Harris had only the harmless type of the bacterium used to vaccinate farm animals . <p> Several years ago , Harris said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine that is federally regulated for animal use . <p> " I injected it just under my skin , and I got a little red circle and after that was gone I was safe , " he said . <p> Harris , who considers it a personal calling to warn America of the bioterrorism threat , said the recent anthrax attacks were only " saber-rattling . " He added : " We are going to be hit and hit massively with a massive barrage after this . " <p> An FBI agent in the region said they are familiar with Harris and his work , and " taking appropriate actions . " <p> Jessica Stern , a Harvard University bioterrorism expert familiar with Harris , thinks he 's harmless . " I do n't think he would actually do anything , " she said . But she 's not so sure about some of the other do-it-yourselfers . <p> When she first heard about the high-quality anthrax sent to South Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle 's Capitol office , Stern said , she thought immediately of James Dalton Bell . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing . He was locked up in a federal prison in Lompoc , Calif. , serving a 10-year sentence in August for stalking two federal agents . <p> When agents investigating the stalking case raided Bell 's house , tucked on a quiet street in Vancouver , Wash. , they found a basement lab with dozens of chemicals . Among them : a toxic nerve agent and other dangerous or deadly substances , according to court records . <p> On his computer they found recipes for making chemical weapons . Witnesses told investigators that he had tried to use green beans to make botulinum toxin . He had also boasted of making sarin gas , the agent used in a Tokyo subway attack that killed 12 and sickened thousands , court records said . <p> " James Dalton Bell is the model of the lone wolf that the FBI worries most about , " Stern said . " Someone who is technically proficient , who has it in for the government . " <p> Thomas Leahy is another . Police searched Leahy 's home in 1996 after he shot his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy survived ) . They discovered an arsenal of chemical and biological weapons . <p> Leahy had mixed nicotine with a solvent that allowed it to penetrate skin , enabling him to deliver a lethal dose of the chemical with a few spritzes from a spray bottle . He had also produced a small amount of ricin , a highly lethal toxin derived from castor beans . Authorities said it was enough to kill more than 100 people . <p> Leahy is now in prison , serving an eight-year sentence for the shooting , to be followed by 6 1/2 years for possessing the dangerous materials . <p> No one knows how many do-it-yourself biologists exist . But like most once invisible subcultures , they now share theories , results and concerns on the Internet . A few have even been accused of using the Internet to subvert traditional scientific peer review . <p> For example , former University of Texas cancer researcher Garth Nicolson shows up frequently on Internet bulletin boards devoted to the Gulf War Syndrome . <p> Nicolson now runs his own private research laboratory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lab , with a sign out front , sits in a quiet business park with wide streets and sprawling parking lots . Inside , dozens of bustling scientists in lab coats work with more than $1 million worth of centrifuges , filters , homogenizers , incubators , mixers , sterilizers and other sophisticated equipment . <p> Nicolson 's laboratory makes money by testing hundreds of blood samples each week for bacteria , minerals , proteins and other substances . The lab also attracts contributions from private donors , mostly to fund research into a process to detect low levels of bubonic plague in blood samples . The institute 's IRS forms do n't name the private donors , but report that the nonprofit organization gets more than $1 million in contributions a year . <p> Most of the papers published by the laboratory 's 40 researchers involve cancer metastasis , a subject Nicolson has studied for three decades . But his studies of Gulf War illness have drawn the most attention . Nicolson believes the mysterious symptoms some veterans of the Persian Gulf War have are caused by infection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes Iraq may have used as a biological weapon . <p> Epidemiologists who have studied Gulf War illness dismiss Nicolson 's hypothesis . Efforts to replicate his findings have failed . But because of intense pressure from veterans ' groups and other advocates who believe Nicolson , the government has funded his research anyway . <p> " He does a pretty good job of publicizing his publications and his theories via the Web , " said Gregory Gray , an epidemiologist at the University of Iowa who has tried unsuccessfully to validate Nicolson 's claims . " Some of these people have sort of a cottage industry . " <p> Another controversial Gulf War researcher , retired New Orleans physician Dr. Edward Hyman , recently procured $3.5 million in federal funding for his Louisiana Medical Foundation by appealing to his congressman , Rep. Robert Livingston , R-La. , who chairs the House Appropriations Committee . <p> Other do-it-yourself scientists have n't been so fortunate . Jay Chaplin and his colleagues at the nonprofit Institute for Applied Biomedicine have developed an innovative concept for an AIDS drug . But because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a for-profit biotechnology company or university , most of their funding comes from raffles , wine-tastings and bowl-a-thons . <p> " We 're talking to several biotech firms , but we feel somewhat proprietary about this drug and want to take our time , " said Sherrie McMahon , operations director at the institute . <p> In Santa Cruz , Calif. , she and her colleagues work in an ant-infested bungalow that used to be a chiropractor 's office . Last year their major expense was a $5,000 fee paid to another laboratory to test their drug , Immudel gp-120 , on eight rats . <p> " This is going to take time , but in the end we 're quite confident this is going to be an important drug , so we 're just patient and go through the process , " she said . <p> The odds are long . In the era of biotechnology , major advances are almost never made outside the university , government and corporate laboratories of the scientific establishment . Except for those whose experiments with dangerous substances attract the attention of law enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End Advance for Sunday , Jan. 20 <p>
