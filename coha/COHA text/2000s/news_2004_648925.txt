<p> While the National Hockey League was putting on its annual All-Star Game in the climate-controlled comfort of the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul , 320 hardier players gathered in this little Canadian village ( population 1,200 ) to play hockey the old-fashioned way  --  on bumpy natural ice , in falling snow , in face-stinging wind and biting , toe-numbing cold . <p> They were paid less than the N.H.L. stars  --  the weekend cost them money , in fact  --  but they had more fun . They also got to drink beer between periods if they chose . <p> Plaster Rock ( also home of the world 's largest fiddlehead ferns ) is named after the gypsum that was mined here in the 19th century ; it 's about 50 miles east of Presque Isle , Me. , and in a different time zone . The biggest local employer is the Fraser sawmill . <p> What drew everyone here was the third annual World Pond Hockey Championships  --  a three-day tournament in which four-man teams compete , in as many as 20 simultaneous games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stanley Cup fashioned of homegrown maple by a local craftsman , Ab Beaulieu . The event is a fund-raiser , with sponsors like Fraser and Labatt 's and with each team paying a $300 entry fee . Most of the money is earmarked for replacing the village 's sole indoor ice rink , built in 1967 and now so antiquated that the electrical system goes on the blink periodically , and so rickety that someone has to shovel the roof every time it snows . <p> The notion of charging people to play hockey outdoors in order to build a better indoor facility is the brainchild of Danny Braun , the director of community development for Plaster Rock and the tournament 's chief organizer . " It 's a little ironic , " he said while standing in World Pond Hockey headquarters , a heated tent  --  complete with souvenir counter and a skate-sharpening station  --  pitched right on the ice of Roulston Lake , where the championships take place . " But it 's a good cause , and everybody loves pond hockey . " <p> In its purest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't fall in ; on a pond , a river , a lake , a slough , or frozen patch of prairie  --  has almost no rules , except for a generally understood edict against body checking and lifting the puck . You drop a pair of boots at one end of a patch of ice and another pair at the other end . Those are the goals ; there are no out of bounds except where the ice runs out or the snow piles up . There are no designated timeouts  --  you play until it 's dark or until you ca n't feel your toes anymore  --  and you play with as many , or as few , people as happen to show up . You can try to keep score , but nobody will remember it . <p> Plaster Rock has necessarily introduced a few regulations . The games  --  30 minutes long , with a five-minute break between halves  --  are played on 22 sheets of ice that are roughly 140 feet by 70 feet ( or three-quarters the size of an N.H.L. rink ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals are wooden frames 6 feet wide ( the width of a standard hockey net ) and 10 inches high ; you ca n't block them by laying your stick down full length across the ice ( nor can you use a goalie stick ) . <p> Each ice sheet has a " monitor , " who keeps score and awards penalty points for infractions , and a couple of " puck chasers , " grammar school children who retrieve errant shots . The teams are limited to four a side because , among other things , that 's how many can comfortably fit , along with their equipment and beer , in an average-size car and not get on one another 's nerves during the endless drive to Plaster Rock . <p> Event Has Worldwide Appeal <p> Teams are not divided according to age or ability . " We thought about that , " Mr. Braun said . " But then we figured people would just lie , and it works out pretty well the way it is . " There were 80 teams this year  --  up from 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the available slots were filled in a single day last May . Mr. Braun said he has had inquiries from some 50 new teams that want to play next year , among them groups from Egypt and Bermuda . " That would really make it the World Pond Hockey Championship , " he said . <p> Many of the teams were local , or what passes for local in New Brunswick  --  within a long day 's trip . But there were also teams from Quebec , Ontario , Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island , as well as four teams from the United States  --  one from Boston and three from around Washington ( all guys , as it happens , who play at the same Rockville , Md. , rink every Thursday night ) . A fifth United States team , from Nashville , was supposed to play but dropped out at the last minute because , many speculated , the wife of one of the players put her foot down . <p> The team that traveled the farthest was the West Coast Pine Riders , from Vancouver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , stopping off in New York for an Islanders-Canucks game before heading up to Plaster Rock . The team from farthest north was the Cluckin ' Puck Loggers , who drove three days from Sioux Lookout , Ontario , which is on the 50th parallel . " There 's us , just one more town , and that 's it , " Warren Hobbs , the team captain , said . <p> Mr. Hobbs was impressed by the ice grooming at Plaster Rock : the little snow cats with whirling brushes in front to clear snow off the surface , and the volunteers from the local fire department who sprayed it with water at the end of each session . " These are world-class conditions , " he said . " Up in Sioux Lookout , we just shovel . " <p> The oldest team was the River Boys , whose name also included a slightly vulgar reference to the players ' age ; they totaled two centuries ' worth of accumulated hockey wisdom , and their jerseys were an appropriate shade of gray . The most photographed team was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore long wigs ( in the style of the Hanson brothers , from the movie " Slap Shot " ) and hammed it up shamelessly , distributing complimentary beers to onlookers . The sentimental favorites were the Royal Rebels , a women 's team from Plaster Rock , consisting of a schoolteacher , a student , a bus driver and a cook . <p> All these players  --  even those from the United States  --  found themselves caught up in something that was in part a small-town festival and in part a collective exercise in nostalgia . <p> The origins of hockey are debated in Canada with almost theological intensity . The game began , depending on which sect you belong to , either around 1810 in Windsor , Nova Scotia , where it was played by boys at King 's College School , or a few years later in Halifax , or in Kingston , Ontario , where it was played by British Army officers . The rules of the game more or less as we know it began to be codified in 1875 , which is around the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early indoor rinks were mostly curiosities , however , and were seldom used for hockey . When the N.H.L. was founded in 1917 , only one of the four teams then , Toronto , skated on artificial ice ; the rest played in cold , barnlike buildings with what amounted to frozen floors . Nowadays the game has been thoroughly refrigerated , and in many Canadian towns it is played all year long and practically around the clock , under the lights , in climate-controlled rinks , with coolant pulsing under the ice . <p> Few people regularly play hockey outdoors anymore , in Canada or anywhere else , but pond hockey has nevertheless persisted in the Canadian national imagination , and was celebrated , for instance , in last November 's outdoor N.H.L. game in Edmonton between the Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens . Outdoor hockey is the fabric of legend , a reminder that in its origins , hockey is to Canada what baseball is to the United States : a mythic , pastoral game . Gordie Howe on the frozen sloughs of Saskatchewan ; Rocket Richard , Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby Orr on Parry Sound ; and Wayne Gretzky on the backyard rink in Brantford , Ontario  --  playing outside teaches " creativity , " or so the keepers of the flame believe , and that 's why nobody today can pass or stick-handle the way they used to . <p> Snow Is an Equalizer <p> For the first two days in Plaster Rock ( the tournament begins on a Friday evening and lasts through Sunday afternoon ) , it snowed more or less steadily , and in the falling flakes Roulston Lake , a little oval near the center of town , rimmed with tall , frosted pine trees , looked prettier than a five-dollar bill  --  a Canadian five-dollar bill , that is , which has an engraving of a pond hockey scene on the back . <p> The snow was not as heavy as it was last year , when a blizzard almost whited-out the final day of the tournament , but it was enough to slow the puck down and take the edge away from some of the more talented players . The key to winning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep one man back , as a kind of roving goaltender ) and , on offense , quick hard shots from outside . <p> The definition of success for many teams at Plaster Rock is just surviving until the final day , when the field is whittled from 80 to 32 ( then , in successive games , down to 2 ) . <p> Danny Melanson , the Chiefs ' captain , promised that if he and his teammates made it that far , they would dye their wigs red . In the end , they did n't need to . The Royal Rebels did n't make it either ( though they were never shut out , as their captain , Tammy Tatlock , announced ) ; same for the River Boys and the Loggers . <p> Among those who did were two teams that everyone watched out for from the first night  --  the Boston Danglers , an exceptionally smooth-skating foursome who are really Canadians , as some locals were quick to point out ( they met while playing for Merrimack College , in Massachusetts , in the mid-90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Frozen Four , the strongest Washington team , carried by Gary Yavanovich , who in his other life is a major in the Air Force . <p> By the final morning it was bitterly cold , with the thermometer reading 7 below zero . The games were slow getting started because not enough monitors could be found and some of the teams were reluctant to leave the warmth of the tent . ( Many of the players and most of the tournament volunteers  --  almost half the population of Plaster Rock  --  had stayed up late the night before , drinking and dancing at a World Pond Hockey social at the high school . ) <p> On the hard , wind-scoured ice , skating was faster , passes sharper , stick-handling more inventive . Without slap shots and body checks , offsides and icing calls , hockey here shed a lot of baggage  --  the bumping and grinding , the dumping and chasing  --  and took on a new and simpler guise , quicker and more elemental than the version you see in the N.H.L. ( or even in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little bit like playground basketball , a little like experimental dance . Unlike the N.H.L. , currently suffering from a scoring drought , Plaster Rock produced goals in flurries and averaged better than 25 a game . <p> The Danglers and the Frozen Four met in the semifinals , and it was a hockey game to treasure , one you would have paid to watch . The Danglers adopted a kind of diamond formation ( one man high , two in the middle , one back ) that created a lot of fast breaks on offense , then quickly turned into a pond version of the neutral-zone trap ; they jammed the Frozen Four up in their own end and led at the half , 12-7 . <p> During the break Major Yavanovich made some adjustments and his team came out flying , zinging diagonal cross-ice passes and shooting quickly , whenever there was an opening . The Frozen Four scored four unanswered goals in the first few minutes , pulled even , then dropped behind again before clawing within one . <p> The final score was 18-17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching knew they had seen hockey every bit as good as what the All-Stars were playing in St. Paul . <p> Braving the Cold to the End <p> This game was so thrilling that the final  --  between the Danglers and the Pepsi Vipers , hometown favorites , of a sort , because the captain , Dave Myles , used to live in Plaster Rock  --  was a bit of an anticlimax , with the Boston team winning , 24-7 . <p> A couple of hundred loyal fans stayed to the end even so , stamping their feet and hugging themselves for warmth . It was so windy that one of a pair of giant inflatable Labatt 's cans toppled . And so cold that the game 's youngest spectator , an 18-month-old named Alexander , was heaped with blankets in his little sled until he resembled a medium-size boulder ; so cold that beer froze in the can and had to be squeezed out like an ice pop . The announcer , Danny MacLean , declared over the public-address system , " You know , it 's not pond hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and a little bit hard . " <p> Beforehand , 12-year-old Jessica Gagnon , a seventh grader from Plaster Rock , sang the Canadian national anthem , unaccompanied , then " The Star-Spangled Banner . " <p> The closing ceremony was pleasingly modest and politely proper , not unlike Canada itself , come to think of it . The mayor of Plaster Rock , Robin DeMerchant , shuffled out on the ice , as did the local member of Parliament , Andy Savoy ( who had also entered a team in the tournament ) . <p> After some brief remarks were made , a uniformed trooper from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police handed the wooden cup to Cooper Naylor , the Danglers ' captain , who skated it around the ice with his teammates . The crowd thumped applause with gloved or mittened hands , then proceeded briskly to the parking lot . <p> " This could never happen in the United States , " observed a maniacal fan who had driven all the way from Boston . " People just walking out on the ice  --  can you imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing around while pucks whiz past ? They 'd make you wear a helmet . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com At the World Pond Hockey Championships , which attracted 80 four-member teams from North America , games were played into the night , with little illumination . Joe Sisson , left , and Wayne Toner of Perth-Andover , New Brunswick , changed in an open-air locker room . Snow fell for the first two days of the tournament , slowing the puck . A bonfire on the lake kept players warm . As many as 20 games were played simultaneously on Roulston Lake , which was divided into 22 rinks .
