So Fondly Shielded // * * * // I was so fondly shielded that I never dreamed I was a piece of merchandise . - Harriet Jacobs , Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl , p. 5 // She did not know . Papa 's pride , Mama 's darling , Grandmother 's joy-she did not know she was a slave . Not until she was six , and Mama died . And really not even then . But later , when she was willed to Little Miss , she had to find out . Hatty was a slave . // Harriet Jacobs was born a slave in Edenton , Chowan County , North Carolina , in 1813 , twenty-four years after the adoption of the Constitution had firmly established slavery in the newly formed United States . It would be seven years before slavery 's spread into new states would be limited by the Missouri Compromise , and a half century before Emancipation . At her birth , there was no reason to think that baby Hatty would live out her life as anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she became an activist and an author , a runaway whose narrative of her life was championed by the abolitionists and feminists and was a weapon in the struggle for emancipation . During the Civil War she went back south , working as a relief worker and an advocate on behalf of the black refugees behind the Union lines in Alexandria and later in Savannah , telling their story in the northern press . When racist violence engulfed the South , she retreated to Massachusetts and then to Washington , D.C. , where she died in 1897 . Harriet Jacobs was an heroic woman who lived in an heroic time . Committing herself to freedom , she made her life representative of the struggle for liberation . // Harriet Jacobs was born in Edenton because her grandmother Molly had been bought and brought there before the Revolution by a local tavern owner . Originally peopled by the Chowan tribe and settled early , Edenton was an important port from 1771 to 1776 , when North Carolina was a British colony . Trade boomed : 828 ships cleared the port , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the West Indies . They carried exports from the pine forests-barrel staves , shingles , tar , and deerskins ; from the farms-corn , cane , tobacco , cattle , and hogs ; and from the water-fish . The largest imports were rum , molasses , salt , and linen . After the Revolution , however , prosperity ended . In 1783 a traveler , eyeing the derelict ships in the harbor , doubted that Edenton would ever reclaim its trade . " It appears that most vessels entering the Sound pass by the town . " He was decidedly unimpressed by Edenton 's inhabitants- " The white men are all the time complaining that the blacks will not work , and they themselves do nothing .... We lived at a regular tavern where ... half a dozen negroes were running about the house all day , and nothing was attended to , unless one saw to it himself . " It was to just such an inn , Horniblow 's Tavern , that the child Molly , Harriet Jacobs 's grandmother , was taken as a slave . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her South Carolina master . At his death during the Revolution , Molly 's father had freed his black family and sent them under British protection to St. Augustine . On the journey , they were captured by Americans , separated , and sold . Edenton 's John Horniblow bought Molly while he was traveling , probably in 1780 , and took her back to his tavern . There she grew to adulthood , becoming , over the years , " an indispensable personage in the household , officiating in all capacities " ILSG p. 6 . The tavern 's central location next to the courthouse , and its role as a public house in a seaport , guaranteed that the observant slave girl knew whatever was going on . // When Molly could slip away-from dusting , sweeping , and making up the beds , from bringing in the water and wood , from peeling and chopping , clearing away , washing up , scrubbing , and scouring-she could run down to the harbor where piles of farm products were shipped out and manufactured goods were shipped in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only cargoes . The port was astir with news that the brig Camden had arrived with a cargo of Africans in its hold , fresh from the Guinea coast after a seven-month voyage . A visiting London merchant commented , " a hundred slaves aboard in the state of nature ( women and men ) . They talk a most curious lingo , are extremely black , with elegant white teeth .... They are all from twenty to twenty-five years of age . " The slave girl Molly , like everyone in town , knew that they had been bought to dig a seven-mile canal and drain a lake across the Sound from Edenton , and that it was to be finished by Christmas , if the rain would stop . // Four years later , Edenton celebrated the adoption of the federal Constitution : at dawn , the Union flag was flown from a staff in the center of town , and the ships in the harbor hoisted their colors ; at noon a salute was fired by a dozen " 24 pounders " ; and at sundown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flagstaff . ( Because Rhode Island had not adopted the Constitution , the thirteenth lantern was kept dark . ) According to the census , in 1790 Edenton consisted of about 150 houses , and its population numbered about 1,000 black slaves-half owned by five large slaveholders-and 600 whites , a third of whom owned no slaves . ( Most of the slaves were numbered as residents because their owners lived in town , although they themselves lived and worked on the farms nearby . ) The unequal distribution of wealth among the whites occasioned complaints , and the local paper deplored both the presence of young men " lolling in tavern piazzas and ... gaping and sauntering about the public rooms , " and criticized the " fine fat hogs in our streets . " With the adoption of the federal Constitution , shipping revived . But in 1795 , a hurricane closed Roanoke Inlet , destroying the most direct passage from Albemarle Sound to the Atlantic . Then as the century closed , work began on the Dismal Swamp Canal from Redding ( now Elizabeth City ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Virginia markets at Norfolk and Portsmouth . Opened to flatboats in 1805 , this canal- " to North Carolina a blood - sucker at her very vitals " - impoverished Edenton as it enriched her Virginia rivals , and it guaranteed that a sea-lane would never be cut through the Outer Banks . // Like every slave , Molly was conscious of the violence of the slavery system , and the 1771 revolution in Santo Dominigo , today called Haiti , must have underscored that awareness . At the nearby island-with a population of 30,000 whites , 40,000 mulattoes and free blacks , and 400,000 slaves-the slaves rose , demanding the rights proclaimed in the French Revolution . The consequence was bloody . Although the revolt was put down , in 1793 Haiti became the first country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish chattel slavery . Whites fled , and Edenton , like other southern ports , experienced an influx of French-speaking refugees . // The refugee Haitians had reason to be terrified of rebellious slaves , and their fear was contagious . In the wake of the events on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly aware of the potential threat posed by its slave population . In 1808 , in an effort to end nighttime thefts by fugitive slaves hiding in the woods and the swamps ( called " pocosin " ) , the town imposed a curfew and mounted a patrol to enforce it . The Edenton Gazette reported in March 1811 that " a party of men , in scouring ... Cabarrus 's Pocosin , came across a Negro Camp , which contained 5 runaway Negroes , 2 wenches and 3 fellows , who were armed . " After capturing both women and shooting and killing two of the men-the third escaped-they found " a vast deal of plunder ... together with a great number of keys " to houses and outbuildings . Their concern , the paper continues , was not only theft . " These fellows , we are credibly informed , had bid defiance to any force whatever , and were resolved to stand their ground : which resolution was exemplified by the resistance they were about to make . Each fellow stood with his musket pointed , watching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fugitives ' camps , called " maroons , " were encouraged by " some of the dram-shop gentry on the wharf , that are suffered to vend their articles at an unseasonable hour of the night , and on the Sabbath . " // In June 1812 , when America declared war on Great Britain , Edenton 's trade-like that of all American ports-collapsed . A year later , local militia units were mustered to prevent a British squadron from landing troops , but the enemy ships , unable to cross the shallow bar , never reached the town . The war intensified the fears of white Edenton concerning the danger their slaves represented . That summer , a worried resident urged that everyone " who has not arms in his house ; immediately procure them . " He feared , he explained , that in defending themselves against the foreign enemy they might ignore " that which may spring up in our bosom ! " // Property lists reveal that by this time Molly had become the mother of five children . ( They say nothing of the children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was owned by his widow , Elizabeth Horniblow . Over the years , as Elizabeth 's daughters married , she would give each bride one of Molly 's daughters as a wedding gift : Molly 's Betty would go to Mary Matilda , and Becky to Eliza . To Margaret , an invalid who would never marry , Elizabeth had already given Molly 's Delilah. // Delilah , according to her daughter Harriet , was " a slave merely in name , but in nature ... noble and womanly . " Hatty was only six when her mother died . When in adulthood she wrote Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl , her autobiography , she offered her readers no memories of her mother 's height or weight , posture , gesture , or expression , but she did specify her color . Both her parents were " a light shade of brownish yellow , and were termed mulattoes " ILSG , p. 5 . Jacobs also writes that she often recalls her mother 's last blessing . Unlike her brother John who , two years younger , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that " in many an hour of tribulation I ... seemed to hear her voice , sometimes chiding me , sometimes whispering loving words into my wounded heart . " It is her mother 's voice-not her face-that lived in Jacobs 's memory . // Of her father she wrote more . When , where , and how Delilah met and married Elijah , we do not know . But Jacobs mentions a ring and reports that-although for slaves , marriage had no legal force-their wedding was not without ceremony . Because Elijah lived on for six years after Delilah 's death , Hatty and her brother had more time to know him , and both evoke a fuller sense of the man . Elijah was born on the Knox plantation in nearby Pasquotank County , probably to Athena , a slave of Dr. Andrew Knox . His father was apparently Henry Jacobs , an illiterate white farmer who owned no slaves and who lived with his wife and children across the county line in Perquimans , within a mile of the Knox plantation . Elijah grew up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenter . Trusted by his owners , he worked on houses in the country and in town , where he met and married Molly Horniblow 's daughter Delilah . Even after Dr. Knox moved away in 1812 , Elijah was permitted to remain in Edenton with his wife and children . Her father , Jacobs writes , was so " skilful in his trade , that , when buildings out of the common line were to be erected , he was sent for " ILSG p. 5 . " By his nature , " she recalls , " as well as by the habit of transacting business as a skilful mechanic , he had more of the feelings of a freeman than is common among slaves " ILSG p. 9 . From their father , little John and Hatty learned to value themselves and to prize both education and liberty . His daughter writes that his " strongest wish was to purchase his children " ILSG p. 5 . His son spells out his tortured life as the father of slaves . " To be a man , and not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkest of fates . My father , " he testifies , " taught me to hate slavery , but forgot to teach me how to conceal my hatred . I could frequently perceive the pent-up agony of his soul , although he tried hard to conceal it in his own breast . The knowledge that he was a slave himself , and that his children were also slaves , embittered his life , but made him love us the more " TT in ILSG p. 208. // Hatty was proud of her father 's carpentry skills , and as she grew old enough to explore the neighborhood , she perhaps recognized Elijah 's expert workmanship in the federal portico at elegant Beverly Hall , or in the unusual drilled spiral molding on James Iredell 's double porch . She was familiar with the barrel-vaulted ceiling and square bell tower and spire of St. Paul 's , where she had been baptized , and with the impressive Georgian county courthouse , with its brick walls and handsome cupola at the end of the green . Yet Harriet Jacobs never describes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her family " lived together in a comfortable home " ILSG p. 5. // This home became a model she would spend her life trying to replicate for her own children . Jacobs probably spent her first " six years of happy childhood " with her father , mother , and little brother in one of the outbuildings behind Horniblow 's Tavern on King Street , with kin all around her-her grandmother Molly , who through her decades at the tavern worked " in all capacities , from cook and wet nurse to seamstress , " her uncle Mark Ramsey , her aunts Betty and Becky , and her uncle Joseph , only a few years older than she ILSG pp. 5-6. // Nurtured by this extended family , little Hatty blossomed . Her eyes dazzled by the sunshine illuminating Albemarle Sound , her ears delighted by the arrival of the stagecoach driver , who came " tearing down ... Broad Street , his horses in full canter , blowing his long tin horn , heralding his approach as he drew up in front of Horniblow 's Tavern , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew no threatening master . Actually , neither her mother nor her grandmother had a master , but instead answered to a mistress . And because her mother was not , like Grandmother Molly , wet nurse to her mistress 's baby , Hatty was not displaced at the breast , as her mother Delilah had been . Harriet Jacobs 's later life testifies that her family successfully protected the bright-eyed little girl , whom they " fondly shielded " in these earliest years ILSG pp. 5. // The most joyous season for all Edenton children , black and white , was Christmas , when the Jon Kuners appeared . //
