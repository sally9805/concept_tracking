<p> Janus Capital Management will pay $ 226.2 million to settle market-timing investigations in a deal announced Tuesday that closes a troubled chapter for the Denver-based mutual fund giant . <p> Ken Salazar , the Colorado attorney general , said at a news conference in Denver that " this is a very important case for the state of Colorado as well as for the country . " New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer , who initiated the probe of Janus last year , said in a statement that " market timers will no longer be given special access and permitted to profit at the expense of long-term investors . " Janus was never formally charged with wrongdoing . But the investigation showed that Janus allowed market-timing agreements , despite an official policy that discouraged the practice . <p> Market timing , the rapid trading in and out of mutual funds , is not illegal , but it can harm long-term investors by adding costs and diluting returns . <p> Janus is one of more than two dozen financial firms across the country that have been under investigation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The settlement , which also involves the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Colorado Division of Securities , requires Janus to make the following payments : <p>  --  Restitution of $ 50 million to investors injured because of market timing , plus $ 50 million in civil penalties . The SEC will oversee how that money gets back to fund shareholders . <p>  --  A $ 25 million-per-year reduction in the management fees charged all mutual fund investors over the next five years , totaling $ 125 million . <p>  --  Payment of $ 1 million to the Colorado attorney general 's office to fund consumer and investor education and future enforcement activities , plus $ 200,000 to reimburse investigation costs . <p> Janus Capital is the country 's ninth largest mutual fund group , with about $ 145 billion in assets and 4 million investors . The company employs nearly 1,000 people , most of them in Denver . <p> " These agreements reflect Janus ' commitment to do whatever is necessary to earn investors ' confidence , " said Steve Scheid , the company 's chairman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . <p> Last September , Spitzer named Janus among four mutual fund families that held market-timing agreements with Canary Capital , a New Jersey hedge fund . <p> Janus told investors it discouraged market timing and blocked many smaller timers . But it also gave preference to certain timers , investigators found . <p> The official policy of four trades in a mutual fund per year " simply was not what was happening at Janus , " Salazar said . <p> Spitzer 's office had pursued Janus and other firms , in part , for alleged violations of securities law . Salazar 's office was the first to investigate market timing as a violation of the state consumer protection act . <p> In December , Janus admitted to a dozen market-timing agreements that cost fund investors $ 31.5 million , an amount lower than the $ 50 million regulators found . <p> " Janus did not object to that higher determination because it will go back to our fund shareholders and clients , " said Janus spokeswoman Shelley Peterson . <p> Janus had actively sought a resolution to the market-timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last week , a move that some analysts said paved the way for this week 's agreement . <p> The settlement appears in line with what other fund groups have reached , said Don Cassidy , a senior research analyst at Lipper in Denver . <p> " There has n't been any real direct rhyme or reason in terms of the various players that have settled , " Cassidy said . <p> Besides the monetary penalties , Janus agreed to other reforms . These include the hiring of an independent chairman to oversee the Janus mutual funds and more thorough disclosure of expenses and fees . Already , Janus has appointed Dennis Mullen as an independent chairman of the trustees overseeing the Janus mutual funds . <p> " These changes are good for investors , " said Colorado securities commissioner Fred Joseph , who was involved in the settlement discussions . <p> RECENT SETTLEMENTS <p> $ 675 MILLION : Bank of America/FleetBoston Financial , March 15 .

The fee reductions , which are being overseen by New York regulators , are expected to be in place by July . <p> The Colorado attorney general 's office is collecting another $ 1.2 million from Janus . <p> Shareholders are n't likely to see any of the $ 100 million for many months . So far , the SEC has n't approved a distribution plan for any of the four other cases it has settled with mutual-fund companies since December , said commission spokesman John Nester . <p> The commission hopes to have distribution plans in place within six months after appointing a trustee to oversee the process , Nester said . But even in the SEC 's first settlement case with Alliance Capital Management , which settled in mid-December , no trustee has yet been named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nester said . " The firms are making a good-faith effort , but nothing has been put in place yet . " Janus ' settlement money , which includes $ 50 million in restitution and $ 50 million in civil penalties , will be placed in an escrow fund under the SEC 's oversight until the commission approves a distribution plan . <p> Don Cassidy , senior analyst with fund-watcher Lipper Inc. in Denver , said Janus and regulators must come up with a sophisticated reimbursement formula . <p> Investors who owned shares as far back as the late 1990s may be eligible , he said , and many of those people have since sold their shares . <p> Janus now has about 4 million fund investors , but the number eligible for reimbursement may be much larger . <p> In determining who gets how much , Janus must take into account which funds were affected by market-timing , to what degree and who owned shares at the time . <p> " Some people may get a few dollars , " he said , " others may get a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday they will be made on a fund-by-fund basis . <p> Applied evenly to Janus ' current investor base , the $ 125 million fee reduction amounts to $ 31.25 per customer over five years . <p>  --  By Greg Griffin <p> HISTORY OF JANUS INVESTIGATIONS : When New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced in September that his office was investigating Janus Capital Management for questionable trading practices , the Colorado attorney general 's office indicated that it did n't plan to investigate the Denver-based mutual-fund family . <p> A month later , Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar changed his mind and ordered his consumer protection division to look into the matter . <p> After reviewing documents , witness interviews and other evidence , some of which were provided by Spitzer 's office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , Salazar 's office decided to formally launch its own investigation in October . <p> " We started seeing documents and other information  --  that indicated to us that there really was a market-timing problem with respect to Janus , and we started conducting our own investigation , " Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , Massachusetts regulators and the SEC charged Putnam Investments , the nation 's fifth-largest mutual-fund firm , with improper fund trading . <p> Two weeks before Christmas , Salazar gave Janus a bomb of a gift  --  his office was ready to file a lawsuit against the company . <p> Within two days of being notified , the bigwigs at Janus , including then-chief executive Mark Whiston , marched into Salazar 's office for four consecutive days of meetings , Colorado Deputy Attorney General Jan Zavislan said Tuesday . <p> Whiston worked feverishly to persuade Salazar to back off the lawsuit by showing that Janus was trying to fix the problems , Zavislan said . <p> And it worked . <p> " Based on their representations to us and their showing that they were very , very serious in trying to address this problem , we decided to hold off filing our lawsuit and instead to begin discussions with them on settlement parameters , " Zavislan said . <p> Salazar announced on Dec. 18 that his office was working on a settlement with Janus . Over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His staff pored over thousands of pages of documents and made several trips to New York to visit with Spitzer and SEC officials . <p> Settlement discussions accelerated over the past three weeks , Zavislan said . <p> On April 20 , Whiston resigned . <p> Three days later , after numerous conference calls with Spitzer 's office and SEC officials , Salazar 's office decided on the final $ 226.2 million settlement , Zavislan said . The deal was announced Tuesday . <p>  --  By Andy Vuong <p> IMPACT ON JANUS : Janus Capital Group has deep-enough pockets to absorb the $ 226.2 million cost of settling market-timing allegations with regulators , analysts said Tuesday . <p> " It is not a cash issue , " said Mark Lane , an equity analyst with William Blair &; Co. in Chicago . <p> Janus held $ 1.2 billion in cash at the end of last year , most of it coming from the sale last August of shares it owned in DST Systems Inc. , a financial software firm . <p> The company plans to use just under half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 852 million to $ 378 million . <p> Absent that debt , Janus frees up $ 30.5 million a year in interest payments , enough to cover the $ 25 million a year reduction in management fees the settlement requires . <p> In a worst-case scenario , Janus has another $ 350 million in DST shares that it can tap to cover other emergencies , Lane said . <p> Morningstar equity analyst Rachel Barnard said she had estimated a $ 200 million hit in her calculations and that the actual amount did n't surprise the markets . <p> Janus shares rose 2.83 percent Tuesday , closing at $ 15.99 a share . <p> What strikes Barnard about the settlement is that Janus , which already boasts some of the lowest management fees in the business , will have to make additional cuts , she said . <p> " They will be a less profitable company , " she said . <p> Management fees earned by Janus in the first quarter of 2004 totaled $ 199.2 million , according to the company 's quarterly report . <p> The $ 226.2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a representative with Janus ' largest shareholder . <p> " It is a lot of money for a company that has n't been charged , " said Franklin Morton , senior vice president of the Ariel Capital Management in Chicago . " Investors just want to move beyond this chapter . " Ariel owned 26.8 million Janus shares at the end of last year , giving it an 11.2 percent interest . <p> Janus already took charges of $ 71.8 million against earnings last year because of market- timing investigations and said Tuesday it would take another $ 59 million charge . <p> Of that $ 59 million , $ 55.7 million covers restitution costs not yet set aside , and $ 3.3 million is for legal and administrative costs . <p>  --  By Aldo Svaldi <p> To see more of The Denver Post , or to subscribe to the newspaper , go to http : //www.denverpost.com @p#
