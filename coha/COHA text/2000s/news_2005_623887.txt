<p> Space buffs are dreaming about vast land developments on the moon , planets and asteroids  --  and wherever people start making land claims , the lawyers ca n't be far behind . <p> Consider this : This year , in a virtually unnoticed decision , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco dismissed a lawsuit by a Nevada man who claims he owns asteroid 433 , a mountainous celestial rock also known as Eros . <p> After NASA landed a robotic spaceship on Eros in 2001 , online entrepreneur and space enthusiast Gregory W. Nemitz of Carson City , hoping to set a legal precedent for future cosmic exploration , informed the space agency that he owned Eros . He had previously filed his claim to ownership of the asteroid at an online registry for celestial land claims , which a Seton Hall University School of Law professor started in the 1990s to stir discussion of space-related legal issues . <p> After NASA landed its probe on Eros , Nemitz asked NASA to pay a " parking/storage fee " of $20 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NASA general counsel Edward Frankle informed Nemitz that his property claim " of a celestial body ... appears to have no foundation in law . " In response , Nemitz sued NASA and the U.S. State Department . <p> In April 2004 , the U.S. District Court in Reno tossed out Nemitz 's suit " for lack of a recognizable legal theory " behind his claims . On Feb. 10 , the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit issued a terse ruling , without explanation , that upheld the district court decision . <p> Disillusioned by the decision , Nemitz  --  a nonlawyer who argued the case himself without the aid of an attorney  --  plans no further legal action . But he 's pretty mad about what he regards as a federal transgression of his rights . <p> " I have a right as a human being to make a claim for anything that is not owned , " Nemitz told The Chronicle on Thursday . " I think claiming a single asteroid is a reasonable claim  --  ( Eros ) is about the size of Lake Tahoe in dimension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're not claiming you 're ruler of the universe . " <p> Bizarre though it sounds , the case of Nemitz vs . United States is just one of the odder sideshows in an emerging circus known as " space law . " Space is new legal terrain , just as the air was in the early days of aviation and as the seas were in the dawn of ocean voyaging . <p> For space buffs , the stickiest legal issue is property rights in space , the question of whether a private person can lay claim to property where there is no constituted government . And it involves not only land , but also the airless void of space . <p> Entrepreneurship is the driving force . <p> Space enthusiasts look forward to an age of space commercialization on a grand scale , ranging from orbital hotels with zero-gravity swimming pools that float in the middle of a room to lunar factories that mine nuclear fuel for terrestrial fusion reactors . They fear such dreams might be stillborn if the legal niceties  --  especially property rights  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property claims in space remains uncertain partly because of the ambivalent wording of the U.N . Outer Space Treaty of 1967 , which called space " the province of all mankind . " A subsequent U.N . document , the so-called Moon Treaty of 1979 , was less ambiguous , as it implied that space resources should be commonly owned by all nations . The United States signed the first treaty but not the second one . Most space fans vehemently opposed the Moon Treaty , believing that its assertion that the moon could not become " property of any state , international intergovernmental or nongovernmental organization " was socialistic and would force space entrepreneurs to share their profits with all nations . <p> In a potentially groundbreaking article on space property rights , space law expert Rosanna Sattler recently argued that an overhaul of current treaties and laws is needed to " stimulate commercial enterprise on the moon , asteroids and Mars . " <p> A major corporation " is not going to invest millions and millions of dollars for a communications system on the moon if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sattler , whose article , titled " Transporting a Legal System for Property Rights : From the Earth to the Stars , " appeared in the summer issue of the University of Chicago Law School 's Chicago Journal of International Law . <p> Another lawyer trying to rewrite space law , UC Davis-educated Wayne White of Boulder , Colo. , advocates revising space law via a legal theory that he calls " property rights without territorial sovereignty . " <p> White , who served on the U.S. State Department 's legal subcommittee at a United Nations conference on space exploration in 2003 , proposes that the United States pass a domestic law that recognizes the right of individuals to own and operate space industries , as long as they obey a " use it or lose it " provision : If they abandon the industry , they give up rights to it . In this way , he says , the United States could awaken other countries to the necessity for revised space laws and encourage them to negotiate a new international treaty that , he hopes , would clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Space development and settlement will not happen if it 's internationally taxed and controlled , " White said . " I think space settlement is a social ' release valve ' that we desperately need . ... It 's only going to get more crowded here on Earth . " <p> Whether legally protected or not , space commerce is becoming a reality . Last week , wealthy entrepreneur-scientist Gregory Olsen returned to Earth after a trip aboard a Russian rocket to the international space station . The journey cost him $20 million , making him the third private citizen who paid for a space voyage . In 2004 , Burt Rutan , designer of the private SpaceShipOne rocket launched from the Southern California desert , won a $10 million award from a private foundation for the achievement . The trip could presage tourist flights to orbit . <p> Meanwhile , President Bush is pushing for renewed human missions to the moon . There , space entrepreneurs speculate , future astronauts could drink water that private firms have extracted from the Hetch Hetchys of the solar system : fallen icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south pole . <p> Also , the Chinese and Russians are talking about establishing lunar mining operations that would ship " helium 3 " fuel to future nuclear fusion reactors on Earth . On Wednesday , China launched its second manned space capsule , the Shenzhou 6 , carrying two " taikonauts , " from a rocket site in remote northwest China . <p> This summer , Nikolai Sevastyanov , president of the Russian aerospace corporation Energiya , announced plans to mine helium 3 on the moon . " We should go about developing the moon step by step , from circumnavigation to landing to the construction of an energy base , " said Sevastyanov , as quoted by the RIA Novosti news service . " After that , we 'll go on to create a powerful electricity plant , " he said . <p> There are conferences aplenty : For example , on Nov. 21-24 , the United Nations is holding a " Workshop on Space Law " in Abuja , Nigeria . <p> Also , on Oct. 26 in Washington , D.C. , the National Academy of Sciences is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon , " which poses questions including " the degree to which land on the moon may be privately owned . " The scheduled speakers include Jim Dunstan , a prominent space lawyer with the law firm Garvey Schubert Barer in Arlington , Va . <p> " If we are able to go out into space and harness the incredible resources that are out there  --  unlimited energy , precious metals  --  then you open up the entire Earth-space system , " Dunstan told The Chronicle . " You do n't have limits to growth , and you can sustain unlimited Earth population . " <p> Unlike some space lawyers , Dunstan takes a more relaxed view of the present legal situation in space . He does n't think that existing laws or treaties need to be seriously revamped , at least not right away , in order for space entrepreneurs to plan for commercial exploitation of the heavens . <p> Still , space lawyers agree on one thing : They 're mighty miffed by online sites that sell low-budget " deeds " to terrain in space  --  say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon . This summer , a space lawyers ' professional organization , the International Institute of Space Law , issued a statement cautioning that " the deeds they sell have no legal value or significance , and convey no recognized rights whatsoever . " <p> Space law promises to be a burgeoning enterprise for future lawyers . By contrast , " when I went to law school ( in the 1970s ) ... there was only one paragraph in one book that mentioned space law , " said law Professor Joanne Irene Gabrynowicz of the University of Mississippi , who is editor in chief of the Journal of Space Law . <p> However , for nonlawyer and asteroid-claimer Nemitz , the Ninth Circuit decision was the last straw : It so disheartened him that he decided against pursuing further legal action . Instead , he 's poured his efforts into developing his private business  --  selling beef jerky online . <p> " Maybe I 'll get the beef jerky business to make me millions of dollars , and then I 'll be able to get back into the space business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
