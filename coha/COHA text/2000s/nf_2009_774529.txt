WE SHALL RETURN // On a cold January day in 1925 , a tall , distinguished gentleman hurried across the docks in Hoboken , New Jersey , toward the S.S. Vauban , a **28;0;TOOLONG ocean liner bound for Rio de Janeiro . He was fifty-seven years old , and stood over six feet , his long arms corded with muscles . // Although his hair was thinning and his mustache was flecked with white , he was so fit that he could walk for days with little , if any , rest or nourishment . His nose was crooked like a boxer 's , and there was something ferocious about his appearance , especially his eyes . They were set close together and peered out from under thick tufts of hair . No one , not even his family , seemed to agree on their color-some thought they were blue , others gray . Yet virtually everyone who encountered him was struck by their intensity : some called them " the eyes of a visionary . " He had frequently been photographed in riding boots and wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even in a suit and a tie , and without his customary wild beard , he could be recognized by the crowds on the pier . He was Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett , and his name was known throughout the world . // He was the last of the great Victorian explorers who ventured into uncharted realms with little more than a machete , a compass , and an almost divine sense of purpose . For nearly two decades , stories of his adventures had captivated the public 's imagination : how he had survived in the South American wilderness without contact with the outside world ; how he was ambushed by hostile tribesmen , many of whom had never before seen a white man ; how he battled piranha , electric eels , jaguars , crocodiles , vampire bats , and anacondas , including one that almost crushed him ; and how he emerged with maps of regions from which no previous expedition had returned . He was renowned as the " David Livingstone of the Amazon , " and was believed to have such unrivaled powers of endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . An American explorer described him as " a man of indomitable will , infinite resource , fearless " ; another said that he could " outwalk and outhike and outexplore anybody else . " The London Geographical Journal , the pre-eminent publication in its field , observed in 1953 that " Fawcett marked the end of an age . One might almost call him the last of the individualist explorers . The day of the aeroplane , the radio , the organized and heavily financed modern expedition had not arrived . With him , it was the heroic story of a man against the forest . " // In 1916 , the Royal Geographical Society had awarded him , with the blessing of King George V , a gold medal " for his contributions to the mapping of South America . " And every few years , when he emerged from the jungle , spidery thin and bedraggled , dozens of scientists and luminaries would pack into the Society 's hall to hear him speak . Among them was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , who was said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lost World , in which explorers " disappear into the unknown " of South America and find , on a remote plateau , a land where dinosaurs have escaped extinction . // As Fawcett made his way to the gangplank that day in January , he eerily resembled one of the book 's protagonists , Lord John Roxton : // Something there was of Napoleon III , something of Don Quixote , and yet again something which was the essence of the English country gentleman . . . . He has a gentle voice and a quiet manner , but behind his twinkling blue eyes there lurks a capacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution , the more dangerous because they are held in leash . // None of Fawcett 's previous expeditions compared with what he was about to do , and he could barely conceal his impatience , as he fell into line with the other passengers boarding the S.S. Vauban . The ship , advertised as " the finest in the world , " was part of the Lamport &amp; Holt elite " V " class . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the First World War , but this one had survived , with its black , salt-streaked hull and elegant white decks and striped funnel billowing smoke into the sky . Model T Fords shepherded passengers to the dock , where longshoremen helped cart luggage into the ship 's hold . Many of the male passengers wore silk ties and bowler hats ; women had on fur coats and feathered caps , as if they were attending a society event , which , in some ways , they were-the passenger lists of luxury ocean liners were chronicled in gossip columns and scoured by young girls searching for eligible bachelors. // Fawcett pushed forward with his gear . His trunks were loaded with guns , canned food , powdered milk , flares , and handcrafted machetes . He also carried a kit of surveying instruments : a sextant and a chronometer for determining latitude and longitude , an aneroid for measuring atmospheric pressure , and a glycerin compass that could fit in his pocket . Fawcett had chosen each item based on years of experience ; even the clothes he had packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen men die from the most innocuous seeming oversight-a torn net , a boot that was too tight . // Fawcett was setting out into the Amazon , a wilderness nearly the size of the continental United States , to make what he called " the great discovery of the century " -a lost civilization . By then , most of the world had been explored , its veil of enchantment lifted , but the Amazon remained as mysterious as the dark side of the moon . As Sir John Scott Keltie , the former secretary of the Royal Geographical Society and one of the world 's most acclaimed geographers at the time , noted , " What is there no one knows . " // Ever since Francisco de Orellana and his army of Spanish conquistadores descended the Amazon River , in 1542 , perhaps no place on the planet had so ignited the imagination-or lured men to their death . Gaspar de Carvajal , a Dominican friar who accompanied Orellana , described woman warriors in the jungle who resembled the mythical Greek Amazons . Half a century later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their shoulders , and their mouths in the middle of their breasts " -a legend that Shakespeare wove into Othello : // Of the Cannibals that each other eat , // The Anthropophagi and men whose heads // Do grow beneath their shoulders . // What was true about the region-serpents as long as trees , rodents the size of pigs-was sufficiently beyond belief that no embellishment seemed too fanciful . And the most entrancing vision of all was of El Dorado . Raleigh claimed that the kingdom , which the conquistadores had heard about from Indians , was so plentiful in gold that its inhabitants ground the metal into powder and blew it " thorow hollow canes upon their naked bodies untill they be al shining from the foote to the head . " // Yet each expedition that had tried to find El Dorado ended in disaster . Carvajal , whose party had been searching for the kingdom , wrote in his diary , " We reached a state of privation so great that we were eating nothing but leather , belts and soles of shoes , cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our weakness that we could not remain standing . " Some four thousand men died during that expedition alone , of starvation and disease , and at the hands of Indians defending their territory with arrows dipped in poison . Other El Dorado parties resorted to cannibalism . Many explorers went mad . In 1561 , Lope de Aguirre led his men on a murderous rampage , screaming , " Does God think that , because it is raining , I am not going to. . . destroy the world ? " Aguirre even stabbed his own child , whispering , " Commend thyself to God , my daughter , for I am about to kill thee . " Before the Spanish crown sent forces to stop him , Aguirre warned in a letter , " I swear to you , King , on my word as a Christian , that if a hundred thousand men came , none would escape . For the reports are false : there is nothing on that river but despair . " Aguirre 's companions finally rose up and killed him ; his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Wrath of God " in a steel cage . Still , for three centuries , expeditions continued to search , until , after a toll of death and suffering worthy of Joseph Conrad , most archeologists had concluded that El Dorado was no more than a delusion . // Fawcett , however , was certain that the Amazon contained a fabulous kingdom , and he was not another soldier of fortune or a crackpot . A man of science , he had spent years gathering evidence to prove his case-digging up artifacts , studying petroglyphs , and interviewing tribes . And after fierce battles with skeptics Fawcett had received funding from the most respected scientific institutions , including the Royal Geographical Society , the American Geographical Society , and the Museum of the American Indian . Newspapers were proclaiming that Fawcett would soon startle the world . The Atlanta Constitution declared , " It is perhaps the most hazardous and certainly the most spectacular adventure of the kind ever undertaken by a reputable scientist with the backing of conservative scientific bodies . " // Fawcett had concluded that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon and that their civilization was so old and sophisticated it would forever alter the Western view of the Americas . He had christened this lost world the City of Z. " The central place I call ' Z ' - our main objective-is in a valley. . . about ten miles wide , and the city is on an eminence in the middle of it , approached by a barreled roadway of stone , " Fawcett had stated earlier . " The houses are low and windowless , and there is a pyramidal temple . " // Reporters on the dock in Hoboken , across the Hudson River from Manhattan , shouted questions , hoping to learn the location of Z. In the wake of the technological horrors of the Great War , and amid the spread of urbanization and industrialization , few events so captivated the world . One newspaper exulted , " Not since the days when Ponce de Le  --  n crossed the unknown Florida in search of the Waters of Perpetual Youth. . . has a more alluring adventure been planned . " // Fawcett welcomed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to a friend , but he was careful about how he responded . He knew that his main rival , Alexander Hamilton Rice , a multimillionaire American doctor who commanded vast resources , was already entering the jungle with an unprecedented array of equipment . The prospect of Dr. Rice finding Z terrified Fawcett . Several years earlier , Fawcett had watched as a colleague from the Royal Geographical Society , Robert Falcon Scott , had set out to become the first explorer to reach the South Pole , only to discover , shortly before he froze to death , that his Norwegian rival , Roald Amundsen , had beaten him by thirty-three days . In a recent letter to the Royal Geographical Society , Fawcett wrote , " I can not say all I know , or even be precise as to locality , for these things leak out , and there can be nothing so bitter to the pioneer as to find the crown of his work anticipated . " // He was also afraid that if he released details of his route , and others attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in countless deaths . An expedition of fourteen hundred armed men had previously vanished in the same region . A news bulletin telegraphed around the globe declared , " Fawcett Expedition. . . to Penetrate Land Whence None Returned . " And Fawcett , who was resolved to reach the most inaccessible areas , did not intend , like other explorers , to go by boat ; rather , he planned to hack straight through the jungle on foot . The Royal Geographical Society had warned that Fawcett " is about the only living geographer who could successfully attempt " such an expedition and that " it would be hopeless for any people to follow in his footsteps . " Before he left England , Fawcett confided to his younger son , Brian , " If with all my experience we ca n't make it , there 's not much hope for others . " // As reporters clamored around him , Fawcett explained that only a small expedition would have any chance of survival . It would be able to live off the land , and not pose a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " will be no pampered exploration party , with an army of bearers , guides and cargo animals . Such top-heavy expeditions get nowhere ; they linger on the fringe of civilization and bask in publicity . Where the real wilds start , bearers are not to be had anyway , for fear of the savages . Animals can not be taken because of lack of pasture and the attack of insects and bats . There are no guides , for no one knows the country . It is a matter of cutting equipment to the absolute minimum , carrying it all oneself , and trusting that one will be able to exist by making friends with the various tribes one meets . " He now added , " We will have to suffer every form of exposure . . . . We will have to achieve a nervous and mental resistance , as well as physical , as men under these conditions are often broken by their minds succumbing before their bodies . " // Fawcett had chosen only two people to go with him : his twenty-one-year-old son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rimell . Although they had never been on an expedition , Fawcett believed that they were ideal for the mission : tough , loyal , and , because they were so close , unlikely , after months of isolation and suffering , " to harass and persecute each other " - or , as was common on such expeditions , to mutiny . Jack was , as his brother Brian put it , " the reflection of his father " : tall , frighteningly fit , and ascetic . Neither he nor his father smoked cigarettes or drank . Brian noted that Jack 's " six feet three inches were sheer bone and muscle , and the three chief agents of bodily degeneration-alcohol , tobacco and loose living-were revolting to him . " Colonel Fawcett , who followed a strict Victorian code , put it slightly differently : " He is. . . absolutely virgin in mind and body . " // Jack , who had wanted to accompany his father on an expedition since he was a boy , had spent years preparing-lifting weights , maintaining a rigid diet , studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , he had suffered little real deprivation , and his face , with its luminescent skin , crisp mustache , and slick brown hair , betrayed none of the hardness of his father 's . With his stylish clothes , he looked more like a movie star , which is what he hoped to become upon his triumphant return . // Raleigh , though smaller than Jack , was still nearly six feet tall and muscular . ( A " fine physique , " Fawcett told the R.G.S. ) His father had been a surgeon in the Royal Navy and had died of cancer in 1917 , when Raleigh was fifteen . Dark-haired , with a pronounced widow 's peak and a riverboat gambler 's mustache , Raleigh had a jocular , mischievous nature . " He was a born clown , " said Brian Fawcett , the " perfect counterpart of the serious Jack . " The two boys had been virtually inseparable since they roamed the Devonshire countryside around Seaton , England , where they grew up , riding bicycles and shooting rifles in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack wrote , " Now we have Raleigh Rimell on board who is every bit as keen as I am . . . . He is the only intimate friend I have ever had . I knew him before I was seven years old and we have been more or less together ever since . He is absolutely honest and decent in every sense of the word and we know each other inside out . " //
