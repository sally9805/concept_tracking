<p> With a high ACT score and a perfect high school GPA , Keyana Mitchell was planning to attend Vanderbilt , Spelman or Emory , any one of two dozen universities with a good reputation and an address far from her native Mississippi . <p> " It was this feeling that I wanted to get away because of the stereotypes associated with the state , " said Mitchell . " It traditionally has been first in bad things and last in good ones . I was interested in going somewhere where I was n't labeled as being from Mississippi . " <p> In November of her senior year at the Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science , Robert Khayat , chancellor of the University of Mississippi , came to visit . He spoke with the principal and other students , and told Mitchell he wanted her at his school . She thought it was a nice gesture , dismissed the idea and believed it was the last she would hear from anyone at Ole Miss . <p> But she was wrong . The admissions director came to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours to her high school and brought her back to Oxford for a tour . Over the next few weeks , Mitchell heard from admissions again , and her mother talked with the chancellor . <p> " At the time , I thought it was weird how much they were keeping up with me , but it made me realize they really did want me to come , " said Mitchell , who was recently awarded a prestigious Truman Scholarship . " Ole Miss is making an effort to increase minority enrollment and improve academics . I think a lot of what makes this a good place comes from the chancellor and trickles down  --  he values all the students . " <p> At a university whose history of desegregation is more violent than the University of Georgia 's , Mississippi has increased the proportion of African-Americans undergraduates from 7.7 percent to 12 percent over the past 10 years , while UGA 's percentage of blacks has hovered between 5.7 and 6.9 percent . <p> Clearly , Ole Miss is n't UGA , which has 24,010 undergraduates . With 9,398 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khayat hand-writes letters to applicants and walks the campus , talking with students . And Ole Miss 's research program is not as extensive as UGA 's . <p> Thanks largely to the HOPE program , Georgia is attracting affluent , high-achieving high schoolers whose average SAT for the class entering in 2000 was 1203 , a score reached by only 300 black students across the state , university officials say . <p> But faced with a legal challenge to UGA 's policy of using race as a factor in some undergraduate admissions , UGA President Michael Adams is under pressure to try other approaches . On Saturday , Adams and Gov . Roy Barnes will host a reception at the Governor 's Mansion to convince African-American students accepted by UGA to attend the governor 's alma mater . A similar event is scheduled for next Saturday at the President 's House in Athens . <p> With race no longer a consideration until the federal lawsuit determines its legality , the number of African-Americans applying for admission to UGA has fallen significantly  --  from 1,593 in 2000 to 961 as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased as well , from 597 in 2000 to 449 on April 1 . Administrators hope to improve the number of black students who actually enroll from the 41.7 percent in 2000 . <p> " I do n't think anyone questions that we are serious about being among the elite in athletics , " said Maurice Daniels , an African-American professor of social work at UGA . If the university were as aggressive in recruiting minority students as it is athletes , " that would demonstrate the institution is serious about diversity . " <p> In addition to the events hosted by Barnes and Adams , UGA now offers $5,000 Georgia Incentive Scholarships to those accepted from nine high schools , some predominantly black , which traditionally have n't sent students to Georgia . UGA offers admission to every salutatorian and valedictorian from the 369 public and private high school programs accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools . <p> " I am not satisfied with where we are now and I know we have more to do , " said Adams , who wants to increase money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember that we are competing for the very best students in Georgia and neighboring states , and we are also competing nationally . " <p> Last fall , Adams talked with high school students about UGA at two preview days on campus , one for minorities and one for academically superior students . Since January , he has talked about opportunities for transferring to UGA with students at Georgia Perimeter , Floyd College and the black majority Atlanta Metropolitan College . Admissions officials and students are contacting top black high school students to encourage them to come to Athens . <p> But such measures may not be enough when it comes to recruiting minorities . The very nature of higher education means " you have to reach out early to minority students , " said Barmak Nassirian , associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers . <p> " With the snap of a finger you ca n't decide we need more students of x , y and z descriptions and simply market yourself , " he said . " It 's a long-term investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sixth grade , telling them they can attend college , provided they focus on school and do the necessary preparation . UGA plans to initiate such a strategy this summer . <p> In the case of Ole Miss , " the kind of personal time ( the chancellor ) takes , what most people at similar institutions delegate to others , speaks to the commitment he has to change , " Nassirian said . " What Robert Khayat has is vision . He sets the tone , and that 's the business of changing the culture of a large bureaucracy . " <p> During his first two years as chancellor , in 1996 and 1997 , Khayat visited almost 70 high schools from Itawamba to Biloxi , trying to increase the number of applicants by dispelling the notion that Ole Miss catered solely to upper class white students . <p> " A university campus needs to be very diverse  --  we now have an initiative to attract more Jewish students , " said Khayat . " We want students and their families to know this is a great place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened in 1962 or 1861 . " <p> To keep Mississippi 's brightest students in the state , Ole Miss touts its honors college and new chapter of Phi Beta Kappa , the national honors organization . While the percentage of African-American undergraduates has increased at Mississippi , so has the average ACT score : it 's 24 out of a possible 36 , five points higher than the state average , three points over the national average . <p> Compared to its peer research institutions , UGA 's black enrollment is n't out of line , according to the Chronicle of Higher Education and a comparison conducted by the University System of Georgia . But the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is a peer institution whose percentage of black college students is almost twice as large as Georgia 's . <p> Chapel Hill has 15,608 undergraduates , 11.2 percent of whom are African-American . More black students applied to UNC in 2000 than in 1999 , and more were accepted  --  411 enrolled as freshmen last fall . As the percentage of black students increased , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1251 in 2000 from 1246 in 1999 . <p> Officials at UNC say the school is " casting a wider net " to attract minorities , visiting communities not reached before and addressing their needs and concerns . Archie Ervin , director of minority affairs , said that students and parents often want to know more than stats and figures , such as " a feel for what the quality of life will be on campus . <p> But UNC officials do n't just focus on high school seniors . They 've created summer programs that bring minority students to campus and networks identifying talented students as young as sixth grade . <p> " The issue is n't the achievement gap in high schools , it 's the limited horizon of young students who do n't have the support of their family or community to go to college , " Ervin said . " It 's critical to introduce that new horizon early enough so that students can overcome the disadvantages and prepare . " <p> Other factors helping to increase black enrollment include UNC 's departmental support and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Ervin . <p> The University of Mississippi has created such an alumnus in Markeeva Morgan , who will work as an electrical engineer for U.S. Navy when he graduates , with a 3.76 GPA , next month . At Ole Miss , he has helped recruit about 100 students . <p> When he could convince black high school students to visit campus , they learned firsthand that they could feel comfortable , he said . Greeks , both black and white , provide social outlets , especially since one black fraternity and two black sororities have houses . <p> " Ole Miss is my school , and I 've had a wonderful time here , " said Morgan . " My biggest regret about joining the Navy is that I wo n't be attending the football or basketball games next season . " Keyana Mitchell of Clarksdale , Miss. , in class at Ole Miss , which enthusiastically recruited her . " They really did want me to come , " she said . / BRUCE NEWMAN / Associated Press Graphic : HISTORY OF BLACKS AT OLE MISS 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduate 1967 : First African-American , Reuben Anderson , finishes law school 1973 : Omega Psi Phi chartered as first black fraternity 1979 : Rose Jackson becomes first black student inducted into Student Hall of Fame 1988 : Phil Beta Sigma becomes first black fraternity house on fraternity row 1990 : Lee Eric Smith becomes first black editor of The Daily Mississippian 1997 : Spurred by students , the university disassociates itself from the Rebel flag 2000 : President of student body , editor of The Daily Mississippian and quarterback of the football team were all African-Americans Source : University Communications , University of Mississippi Graphic : BLACK ENROLLMENT As UGA struggles to maintain its proportion of black undergraduate students , the universities of Mississippi and North Carolina at Chapel Hill have increased theirs .
