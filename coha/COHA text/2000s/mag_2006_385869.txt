THE TRUTH ABOUT HER TOUGH CHILDHOOD , THOSE MARRIAGE RUMORS , AND HER RULES FOR RAISING HER LITTLE BOY By Liz Smith // Sarah Jessica Parker is not who you think she is . Thanks to Parker 's six-year stint as sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw on the hit show Sex and the City , many assume that the actress is , like that character , a flighty , flirty girl who likes to paint the town red . But the Sarah Jessica Parker who arrives at lunch on a warm day in downtown New York City has nothing in common with her alter ego . Instead , this wisp of a woman is not a girl at all . She is a devoted wife and mom who is unfailingly polite and gracious-a lady in the truest sense of the word . One of eight children who grew up outside Cincinnati , Parker began acting at age eight in local productions and eventually found her way to Broadway . By age 12 , she was starring in Annie as everyone 's favorite orphan . She then found steady work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shows like How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying . That musical brought her together with the man who would become her husband , actor Matthew Broderick . The two stars wed in 1997 and have carved out a cozy home life in New York City 's chic Greenwich Village neighborhood with their three-year-old son , James Wilkie . Parker , 41 , relishes her role as a mom and lights up when she speaks of her little boy . Since Sex and the City ended its run in 2004 , Parker has made a successful return to the big screen . She got strong reviews for her performance as an uptight businesswoman in last winter 's The Family Stone , then charmed audiences as the woman pushing Matthew McConaughey out of the nest in the hit romantic comedy Failure to Launch . She has also endorsed the Gamier Nutrisse line of haircolor and created her own signature fragrance . Parker 's perfume , which is a best seller , bears a name that easily sums her up : Lovely . Dressed casually in a white cotton blouse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple knot , Parker is right at home in this sunny bistro . She does n't hesitate to order a large plate of linguine with pesto and then devours every last bite . I 'm thrilled you 're having lunch with me . I 'm sure you have so many other fabulous places to be . No , no ! People always assume that I 'm some sort of party girl , and that 's such a misconception because I like staying home . People think my husband , Matthew , is this quiet , retiring type , and it 's actually the total reverse . I 'm at home , and Matthew loves going out on the town . How have you and Matthew managed to maintain such a strong marriage ? Well , I do feel lucky . I still like him . I mean , I love him-that goes without saying . But to like somebody at this stage , when we 've been together for 14 years-I think that says a lot . I think it helps that we live here , in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the curiosity about personal lives that exists out there . You ca n't live in New York City and be the most important person in town , you just ca n't . There are too many other important people here . You 're one of eight children . Are you close to your family ? Very . And most of my siblings live here , close to New York . I think growing up in a big family taught me a lot of problem solving and how to share and compromise , and that 's been helpful in my marriage . But my husband , in terms of his upbringing , is in many ways the exact opposite because he 's the only son and the baby . He 's the youngest by a significant number of years-he was pretty much a surprise baby-so he feels more like an only child in some ways . But he 's just-I know , I 'm going to start gushing-he 's just lovely . He 's a good , good person . How much did life change when you had your son ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the best possible ways . I was 37 when James Wilkie was born , and I 'd like to think I 'm a much better mother than I would have been ten years earlier . I know that just from seeing my mother raise eight children , with nothing and no help and being young . And I think Matthew and I are better people for having a child . Otherwise , I think both of us would have worked too hard for too many years . Now , thanks to James , there 's a balance . Our work has a wonderful new place in our lives because leaving the set and coming home is so exciting . When I round the corner to my street and when I open the door and see my son .. . whatever happened in my day prior to that is unimportant . My son does n't know how flawed I am , how flawed we are . He still likes us so much , and that 's so incredible to be around . He 's the light of our lives . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children opens up your life . Do you want to have another child ? Absolutely . If that 's not what happens , I 'll still feel very lucky . But I would love for him to have a sibling ; I think it would be better for him not to be an only child . But we 'll see what happens .... You 've worked so much since he was born . Do you feel you get to spend enough time with him ? No . I mean , he 's with me all the time-he 's been with me every day on the set of the last two films I 've done-and I think he feels very loved and safe . He knows how deeply we feel about him . But it 's time for me to take a break . I would like to not work for at least four months . And I realize how lucky I am to have that option . Are you a strict mom , or are you a pushover ? I 'm pretty strict . And Matthew is completely different from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you think he 'd be . Anytime James does something that is outside accepted three-year-old behavior , Matthew will explain it away based on age . Like " Come on , he 's only three years old ! " Recently , I said to him , " I can just see it now : You 're going to be saying " Come on , he 's only 42 .... Come on , he 's only 71 . ' ' " It 's like , when do you stop ? Kids actually like boundaries . They dig them . They want them . But Matthew does n't want to deny him a thing . He 's a typical dad-he 's the one who says yes to everything that I 've said no to earlier . How do you make sure that your son does n't turn out to be spoiled ? We 're sensitive to anything that would make him feel like a child of affluence . We remind him of certain things , and we do n't want him to make assumptions . I do n't want him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain way and get away with it . Your marriage to Matthew came under intense scrutiny after you won a Golden Globe award a few years ago and you forgot to thank him in your acceptance speech . And just like that , according to the tabloids , our marriage was over . Meanwhile , Matthew could n't have cared less . Never mind the fact that he did n't even know about it , because he was working ... or that Matthew , by the way , had won some awards in the past and had n't thanked me . For some reason , that was acceptable . But for me to not thank him ! Well , clearly , that made me a bitch , and also , clearly , a woman ca n't achieve anything without a man . And when Matthew was confronted outside our home by paparazzi shouting " Is your marriage over ? " he actually said , " Why would Sarah Jessica thank me for work that she did with 200 other people ? " Of course , nobody ever printed that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I say about it today : Come back and check with me in 25 years and see who I 'm married to . It will still be him . During your courtship , you did n't hide the fact that you 'd hoped Matthew would ask you to marry him . OK , here 's what happened : I went on David Letterman 's show , and Dave said , " So you 're dating Matthew Broderick . What 's he like ? " I said , " He 's fantastic . He 'd be perfect if he 'd ask me to marry him . " I was joking ! But then , after that , I was seen as this wanton , desperate woman who was plotting and planning . I must have seemed like an old maid . How did you ultimately get him to commit ? I gave him an ultimatum . No ! I 'm kidding ! He did it in his own time , in his own way . And it was wonderful . Having grown up without much money see box , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I rarely splurge . But last year , around Christmas-time , I went shopping for myself . I ca n't remember the last time I did that . When I was doing Sex and the City , I just lived off the leftovers . But now I find myself actually needing clothes . So I went shopping , and it was fantastic ! So much fun . You do n't feel guilty about that little spree , do you ? No . But it 's funny because in the old days , like ten years ago when I would go shopping , I used to get a stomachache afterward . I would have such intense guilt . I would tell the salesperson beforehand , " Listen , I 'll probably see you tomorrow because I 'm going to bring all this back . " They never believed me , but sure enough , I would go back the next day and say " I could n't sleep . " After this recent spree , though , I slept fine . I guess that proves I really believe I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let yourself indulge in more regularly ? Well , I really like reality television ! Seriously , I love The Amazing Race and another reality show , Project Runway . After I put my son to bed at night , I sit down and watch those shows , and that feels like a complete luxury . I do n't have everything else going on in my brain . Any naughty foods that you ought to avoid but ca n't ? Oh , Liz , I love to eat . I think about food all the time . Matthew and I will lie in bed at night , and we 'll say to each other , " Who is going to make the coffee tomorrow ? What kind of coffee should we have ? The Kenyan or the Jamaican ? What are we going to eat ? If you get up before me , are you going to make bacon ? Will you make the eggs over easy ? Will you put cheese in them ? Should we have whole wheat toast ? " It 's very sexy . Then we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to eat for lunch . And at lunch , we talk about dinner . Basically , we think and talk about food all the time . But , my dear , you do have a very enviable figure . I want to say something about that , which is that no real woman should look to any woman in this industry as an example . It 's simply not applicable because of the enormous number of advantages we have . Women in this country should be reminded to be healthy rather than to be a size zero . I 'm not going to kid you : Money changes everything . I 'm fortunate enough to have things like private trainers and yoga classes . I realize that . But it 's not as if you 've spent a fortune having plastic surgery . You work out regularly , yes ? Yes , I do now , because it 's come to my attention that I 'd better do it . I do yoga whenever I can , and I do like feeling fit and healthy . When you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what shape you 're in because you wake up every day feeling OK . But now that I 'm older , I need to do more for myself . Early on , were you ever pressured to change your appearance , get a nose job , things like that ? I think everybody , at some point in my career , has made some sort of suggestion . I 'm not an idiot , and I understood that there was a standard of beauty and that I did n't fit into it . But I 've always thought of myself as an actor who is on a journey , and part of that journey is finding good work , regardless of my appearance . I 've never wanted to homogenize myself in the way that was expected in the past . And now , I 've surrounded myself with the sort of people who support me just the way I am . When you do have some spare time , how do you relax ? I read , watch TV , or knit . But I try to knit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up with many dropped stitches . And I am a big reader . Never leave the house without a book , my mother always told me . My mother would sit in traffic with the New Yorker on her lap . So all my siblings and I always have a book or a paper or something . So clearly you are n't the party girl that you portrayed on Sex and the City ! No , not at all . I understand why people identify me with her so much-I was in their homes as Carrie for so long . But while I have great affection for her , I am not her . And although Sex and the City is known for raciness , you never did any nudity on the show . And I basically never cursed either . I do n't curse . And no , I never did nudity . I was always too afraid to take my clothes off ! It 's just not something I 'm comfortable with . So now that you 're officially a movie star , would you ever return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway whenever they will have me . I 've just finished three movies back-to-back , and they were all great . And I will work hard to be worthy of more such opportunities . The past 20 years have been like a dream , and I 'll do whatever I can to make sure it does n't end .

We did n't have Christmases sometimes , or we did n't have birthdays sometimes , or the bill collectors came , or the phone company would call and say " We 're shutting your phones off .
