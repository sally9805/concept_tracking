This week , Saddam Hussein is expected to have his day in court . The former Iraqi dictator 's trial will draw a sharp line between Iraq 's past and its future . But do n't expect it to look like Law and Order transplanted to Baghdad . A primer on the court , its task and the possible outcomes : <P> What are the charges ? <P> Premeditated murder , torture and forced expulsion , as well as possible others , linked to the 1982 Dujail Affair , in which men from the town of Dujail tried to kill Saddam as his convoy passed through town . The regime retaliated , torturing and killing 143 townspeople , and destroying the orchards that were the town 's source of income . <P> What will happen in court ? <P> Saddam will sit behind bulletproof glass , before a three-judge tribunal . There will be no jury . Instead of the adversarial model of British and U.S. courts , expect to see the inquisitorial system of France and Egypt . A team of investigative judges gathers facts , levies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls and quizzes witnesses . Saddam 's lawyers can suggest names , but they ca n't call their own witnesses . <P> Can he get a fair trial ? <P> Not at the moment , say Saddam 's lawyers . They 're already claiming the tribunal did n't hand over its case file of 2 million documents until Sept. 25 . With less than the full 45 days the law allows to mount a defense , Saddam 's team will likely move for an immediate dismissal . If that fails , they 'll argue for a delay to review the tribunal 's file . If that does n't work , expect them  --  rightly  --  to play the " unfair " card . <P> What if he 's convicted ? <P> There will be an appeal , but it 's expected to fail . <P> The evidence against the former dictator seems strong and possibly includes his personal sign-off on a list of the 143 from Dujail who were executed . If found guilty , he would be hanged within 30 days of his final appeal , in line with Iraqi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
