Ben Rosenbaum reports that in addition to a forthcoming collection of short stories ( as yet untitled , but due out in May ) , he has also had a big part in an art project called " Anthroptic , " which will open in New York City on October 13 ( more information should be available at http : **27;3494;TOOLONG ) David Ackert is an actor who also worked on " Anthroptic . " His other work includes the films Suckers and Cool Crime , a short film entitled Blue Plate that he also produced , and parts on television shows such as CSI : Miami and JAG . He is currently producing and appearing in a documentary entitled Voices of Uganda . Their first collaboration is a subtle and potent story that reads like it may be the start of a larger work . <p> SHE 'D FOUND HIM BY THE side of the road : Ivan , who had been prince of the immortals , lying in the long grass . Ivan , against whose knees weeping kings had laid their cheeks ; who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whores , revolutionaries , poets , anarchists , and industrial magnates ; who could send armies into the sea with a movement of his hand . She 'd stopped her Model T where he lay by the side of the road . He was shell-shocked , marooned at the end of one kind of life , an empty carapace , soul-dry . There were a million drifters and Okies and ruined men cluttering the gutters of Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's America ; and Muriel had taken him for a white man at first . Colored doctor 's daughter stopping for what looked like a white hobo ; the wild danger of that . On that improbable fulcrum , his life had turned . He 'd told her what he was . She was a mortal ; of course she was afraid . But she 'd listened ; and at the end of that long , mad tale , she 'd gotten up from her cedar kitchen table , cleared the teacups , washed them in the sink and dried her hands . " I believe you , " she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark water within him . He 'd studied the grain of the polished cedar wood , not meeting her eyes . She was like a glass he was afraid of dropping . But even without looking , every creak of the floorboards , every clink of the dishes told him : stay . The wedding had been a long Sunday in June . The church was bright , with thick white paint over the boards . It seated forty , squeezed together on pine benches - two rows of out-of-town relatives and Muriel 's father 's old patients had to stand in the back . There was potato salad and coleslaw and grits and greens on the benches outside . The rich smell of the barbecue , the smoke from the grill . Mosquitoes dancing in the afternoon light . Muriel smiling and crying and laughing . With Muriel set into the center of his world like a jewel , Ivan was home ; when she touched his hand , his enemies became God 's wounded children , his centuries of pain and crime a fireside tale to wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuted . He was a fool in a garden . Without her , the world was a desert of evil beings . And he was full of fear - full of fear , that she would go . Aunt Gertrude was saying , " No no no , the Monroes , from the other side of the family , you know - I think they out in Kansas . Very respectable . Well let me tell you this , child-I knew that man was perfect for Muriel before she told me he was family . The moment I laid eyes .... " The women fluttered about Ivan and fussed at him . The men tried out their jokes and stories on him . He nodded and laughed , and watched what their bodies told each other . Yes , he was an out-of-towner , strange , his past unknown ; drifter , some said , the kind you want to keep on moving past your town . But that kind settled down sometimes - now look how hard he worked at the mill , when there was work . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you know that 's what Muriel needed to be satisfied : someone with an air of strangeness , like this green-eyed ageless second cousin who had probably been in the Great War . And he had n't pulled any of his puppeteer 's strings . Not one . All on their own , they had chosen him . Except Li'l Wallace . Li'l Wallace was polite . He complimented Muriel 's dress and he told the men the one about the sailor and the Dutchman . But to Ivan , the man 's thoughts were as loud as a siren : How had this stranger , this high yellow " second cousin " with city manners and slippery ways , won Muriel ? Li'l Wallace was strong and good-looking and a steady day-shift man at the mill , and he was from around here . Sure , he was dark , but he could n't believe all Muriel wanted was a light-skinned man ! After ten years of patient and chivalrous wooing , he had a right to the heart of the doctor 's daughter . He could n't fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception , Li'l Wallace 's eyes tracked across Ivan 's face , hands , clothes , looking for a weakness . Ivan squirmed . It would be so easy : to shift the cadence of his voice to match Li'l Wallace 's ; to hold his shoulders in a certain way that would remind Li'l Wallace of his dead brother ; to be silent at the right moment , then say the words Li'l Wallace was thinking ; so that Li'l Wallace would feel suddenly an unreasonable rush of affection for him , would grin , shake his head ruefully , give up his desire for Muriel and love Ivan . Ivan felt like a cripple . Like a man trying to feed himself with a fork held in his toes . And he was afraid . Eventually , Li'l Wallace would find something out of place . What if he found out enough to hate and fear Ivan ? To turn these people against him ? Part of Ivan seethed with rage that any human would look at him with those suspicious eyes . How good it would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to adoration . But if Ivan was going to be human , to be here , he would have to leave the puppeteer 's strings alone . Ivan had been sitting on a picnic bench in the churchyard , smearing his last piece of cornbread into the cooling dabs of gravy , when Li'l Wallace approached . " You smoke ? " Ivan blinked up at him . What was this ? " I have , " he said . He watched the resentment and mistrust brewing in the mortal , calculating its trajectory , aching to banish it . " Good , " Li'l Wallace said , and pressed something small , square , and cold into Ivan 's hand . Then nodded , and walked away . Ivan looked at the lighter . And up at Li'l Wallace 's retreating back , and in it , the decision , simple and sweet : that Muriel deserved to be happy . A shiver raced through Ivan 's body . He thought : this human has surprised me . This human has surprised me ! Ivan 's heart beat large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white dress , swinging a niece in slow circles in the air . How can this be ? And then Ivan answered himself : because in ten thousand years , this is what you have never seen : what happens , what they choose , if only you leave them alone . There were moments when he suddenly felt lost in this new life . Sitting by the pond with Li'l Wallace , a checkerboard between them , throwing bread to the ducks , his heart would abruptly begin to race and he would think , what am I doing here ? I am wasting time , there is something terribly important I must do , and first of all I must take this human - make sure he is mine , under my control , safe . He 'd squeeze his eyes shut and wait for the feeling to pass . Or he 'd be in a church pew singing David 's psalms and be overcome with a memory : walking through a walled city to the court of a hillcountry half-nomad potentate , asses braying in the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scowling at the princes and lords in disgust - this one too passive , this one low and mean , this one dissolute , none of them souls he 'd want pressed close to him . And then turning to see the hard eyes and wild grin of the minstrel boy sitting in the corner with a harp in his goatherd 's hands . Thinking : ah , yes . You . On you I will build an empire , and a path to God . Whatever you were before , now you are mine ; now you are the arrow that pierces Heaven . And seeing the yearning begin in the boy 's eyes , the yearning that would never end , that only Ivan could fulfill . And in the middle of the mill floor , a fifty-pound sack of flour on one shoulder , Ivan would stop , remembering the shadow the roach cast . After he 'd feasted on a hundred centuries of human devotion and need , when he was full of power and empty of fear , he 'd forced his way past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he 'd expected answers and angels - in that terrible light , he 'd seen a roach skittering across a wall . And he 'd known that that automaton , that empty dead machine creeping on and on and on over the bodies of the dead - that insect was Ivan . He 'd burned his castle . Burned his library of relics - the jade knife that killed this one , the lock of that one 's hair . Abandoned his living prizes to madness . He 'd vanished into a Europe descending into hell : walked through fields of corpses amidst the whistling of shells , on dusty roads by the tinkling and bleating of starving goats . Stared at the blue walls of the sanatorium , seeing the eyes of all those he 'd taken . A wall of eyes in darkness . Years that were all one long moment of terror and rage and shame , before he 'd crossed the Atlantic . Now , when it came upon him , he shouldered the bag and moved his feet . One , then the other . Watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one , whispering their names . That 's Henry . That 's Roy . That 's Li'l Wallace . Thought of Muriel waiting at home . Of ham and collard greens . Coffee . Checkers . Lucky Strikes . The eyes still watched him , from their wall . IVAN LOVED positioning the checkers , sacrificing one to save another , cornering , crowning , collecting . He loved pretending to make a stupid mistake , giving his last piece to Li'l Wallace with a show of effort and disappointment . And if Ivan kept his eyes carefully on the ducks in the pond and hummed a song from the radio silently to himself , sometimes he could distract himself enough that Li'l Wallace 's moves would actually surprise him . The sun was touching the horizon now . Li'l Wallace finished his smoke and handed the lighter back to Ivan . " How 's married life ? " " Ca n't complain , " Ivan said , and looked over at Li'l Wallace . The question was guileless , friendly . But Ivan felt uneasy . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li'l Wallace said with an easy smile , his eyes on the lake . Blood rushed to Ivan 's face and he turned away . He closed his eyes and remembered Muriel crying in the kitchen . " Shush , " she 'd said , pushing him away , " shush , Ivan , yes , I knew , I know what life I chose , now you just let me be , you let me be . " Her cheeks glistening , the bedroom door slamming . ( And he could make her laugh again , make her happy again , instantly , so easily ! He 'd closed his eyes , knowing where that road led : a madman in an empty palace , a lock of hair in a ribbon , burning . ) Ivan heard Li'l Wallace shift in his ehair . So there you are , you bastard , Ivan thought . You were right all along . You are the right one for Muriel . You could have given her a real life , a real family . I can only give her a parody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace 's , only compassion . And that was too much for Ivan to bear . He pushed himself out of his chair and headed for the woods . Li'l Wallace said something ; Ivan kept walking . He did n't speak , he did n't gesture . He did n't trust what he might do to Li'l Wallace if he did . Ivan pissed against a tree , buttoned up , and walked deeper into the woods , toward the abandoned graveyard at its heart . He slowed his heartbeat and watched the shadows among the leaves . Then , at the graveyard 's edge , he saw the girl . She had dirty blonde hair and wore a dress stitched from old calico rags . She was about eleven years old . She knelt in the dirt , her eyes closed , framed in the sun 's last light filtering green through the trees . She was praying . Her lips moved , clumsy , honest . There were tears on her cheeks . Ivan felt her prayer , like a beam piercing through the veil . That veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that door he had opened at such cost , was like a cobweb to her . She was whispering in God 's ear . Ivan shifted his posture to become a white man , made himself calm , comforting . He knelt by her and put his hand on her shoulder . She opened her eyes but she was not startled . She smiled at him . " I 'm Ivan . What 's your name ? " " Sarah , " said the girl . She bit her lip . The question she was expecting was , what are you doing out in these woods alone ? Instead he asked : " What are you praying for ? " Sarah drew in a deep and shuddering breath , but she did n't cry . " I live with my sick grandma . When she dies , I 'll be alone . Ai n't nobody else to take me in . But I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . Cod 's gon na " send someone . " Ivan stroked his hand across her hair . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shape was so familiar . Where had he seen them before ? He wondered if a little manipulation in a good cause might be permitted him . Surely he could arrange for a family of whites to take her in . Maybe he would ask Muriel to bend their rules . Maybe - There was a crunch of boots on leaves in the forest behind him . " Ivan ? " Li'l Wallace said . Ivan jumped up . Damn , damn , he 'd been lost in the little girl 's eyes . Sarah looked wildly around . Li'l Wallace stared at them and frowned . They were both looking at him , and there was no time . Maybe he could have craf ted a way to look that would have set them both at ease . In the old days , when he was powerful . But he was so tired now , and he could n't risk losing his new home . So he looked as Li'l Wallace expected him to - Negro . The girl screamed . " Oh my God ! " she shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair where Ivan had touched it . " You 're a nigger ! Oh my God , no , you 're gon na - " Li'l Wallace hissed in breath , and in it Ivan heard their future . The girl running , crying , found on the road , her imagination feverish . Torches . Guns . Dogs . Crosses of fire . Li'l Wallace 's feet kicking in the air , kicking , finding no purchase , nowhere to stand . Sarah drew another breath to scream and Ivan took her . She ran to him and collapsed into his arms , buried her face against his stomach , sobbing . Ivan lifted her up gently , nestled her face against his neck . For Li'l Wallace 's benefit , he said , " Shush now , little miss , you know no one gon na hurt you here , we 're decent folk here , no one gon na treat you with any disrespect , come now , Ivan 's gon na take you back to your home . " And when he looked up into Li'l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li'l Wallace blinked and smiled uneasily and let a breath out . His eyes said : you handled that well . I hope . Ivan nodded and walked back toward the pond . Li'l Wallace stood behind him , uncertain whether to follow , and Ivan said , " I 'll see you tomorrow , brother . " The brown duck quacked at him by the side of the pond . Wanting bread . But he had no bread left . Sarah 's little body was warm and light against his . He leaned his head back a little to look in her eyes . She would follow him anywhere . She did n't care if he was white or black . He was her sent angel . Ivan felt the sting of tears . Could it be different , this time ? What if there was no shaping , no manipulation , no harvesting ; what if he gardened her soul , not for himself , but for her ? She was his now : very well , he would be hers . His heart was racing ; he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the collected clear themselves away to make room for the master 's will , and it sickened him . He could cherish her , like a daughter . Would it bring her back to herself ? He 'd freed prizes before , abandoned them to collapse into madness . Not this time . Too late to turn back . He steeled himself : this time there would be only love , a father 's love ! He put Sarah on her feet as they approached the porch steps . She leaned in toward him , inhaled the scent of him as it breezed off his shirt , his jacket , his skin . He looked down at her , scratching his jaw , and opened the door . " Muriel ? " he called in , escorting the girl inside . He sat Sarah down at the kitchen table and scooped generous curls of ice cream into a bowl . He heard Muriel coming down the stairs as he handed Sarah a spoon . Muriel stopped when she saw the girl . She had not expected a third person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This here is our new friend , Sarah , " Ivan said . " Hello , Sarah . " Muriel nodded , a nod of extreme politeness , a nod in which no one could find any insolence at all . Her spine was knotted tense . She looked around the room at the chairs , wondering if she should sit down . Smiled broadly . Tried not to wonder where this girl 's people were , if they were looking for her , what they would do if they found her here . Trying to trust Ivan , fust a little girl eating ice cream , Ivan saw Muriel tell herself , trying not to think of torches and dogs . Sarah shrank back a little . She glanced at Ivan , looking for some cue or instruction . She found it in his expression and put down the spoon . " I do n't mean to be any bother , ma'am . Your husband was kind enough to help me after I took a fall on the road . He kept saying nice things about you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " Sarah sparkled at her hostess . Her smile was warm and innocent , smudged with vanilla . " Oh , " Muriel said , relaxing a little . " Of course . " She stepped forward and opened the napkin drawer . " Well , you 're certainly welcome here . " Sarah flicked a look back to Ivan . He smiled to reassure her . Well done , little one . We will convince my Muriel . She needs a little time for these fears of hers , fears from the world beyond this house . They do n't belong in this house anymore ; they do n't matter now . Sarah stroked her chin , mock serious . " Now if I had to guess , I 'd say you made this delicious ice cream yourself , am I right , ma'am ? " Muriel laughed and turned back to the girl . " Oh yes , and it 's kind of you to .... " She stopped and looked at Ivan . He realized he was stroking his chin in exactly the same way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl a checkered napkin . " Sarah , would you excuse us for a minute ? " Sarah did not move . Not until Ivan dismissed her . Then she collected her bowl , flashed a jealous glance in Muriel 's direction , and went out to the porch . Muriel waited until she heard the screen door swing shut . " Ivan , what in Heaven 's name is going on here ? " " I 'm sorry , Muriel , " he said . Maybe Muriel had n't believed Ivan 's stories until now , not all the way . She 'd listened attentively to all he told her about what he was , what he had been , while she fell in love with him . But for her it was just a bad old life he 'd led , as if she 'd married a man who had fought his way up from being a back-alley drunk . She had n't thought too much about the people he 'd left behind . " You 're sorry ? " " I just wanted to talk to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was in a bad way , and I thought we could help her - " He gritted his teeth with the effort of leaving alone the tension knotting the muscles of Muriel 's neck , the panic in her eyes . A mortal man would soothe her , would n't he ? Li'l Wallace would soothe her . But where was the line ? Did he err , in keeping his face flat , his movements drained of their power to unravel her fear ? She turned her face away . " Li'l Wallace came up and I had to be Negro again . The child panicked , so I ... I had to .... " " How could you ? " Muriel whispered . " Muriel , it ai n't like that . I do n't want a prize or a tool . It 's - it was just - the girl 's about to be orphaned . We could ... she needs us . " " You promised me , Ivan . " Muriel whispered . It burned like a bullet through Ivan 's heart . " Muriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . We can do this with love , Muriel , as a family - " She whipped around to face him . " Ivan , how can you be what you are and be such a fool ? Look in that little white girl 's eyes , look at how she looks at me . That 's not a daughter , Ivan . That 's a slave . Is that what you think I want ? " It would be so easy , so easy . " Oh Ivan , " she would say . " You 're right , I 'm just shocked is all-but that poor little girl-bring her back in . Let 's make this work . " And then he 'd have lost her . He 'd have two slaves . " This is what I am , Muriel , " he hissed . " Should I just abandon her ? I 'm responsible for her - " Muriel walked to the sink and held onto it , seeking purchase . " You 're responsible to me , too , Ivan . You chose me too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of her eye a few times as if something was stuck there . " So what , then ? Are we going to run away from my home and family ? Set up a new life for you and your white daughter , with me as the maid ? " She leaned forward at him , her face flushed dark as wine , her voice shaking . " Or are you just gon na change everybody so they do n't mind any that she 's white ? Or so they do n't know no more ? Are you going to just work some of your tricks on Aunt Gertrude and Li'l Wallace and the preacher and the police ? Are we all gon na end up as your trained puppies ? " He stood up from his chair , his hands at his sides . He put his ice cream spoon down on the table . If the others of his kind had been there , they would have heard volumes in the clatter of that spoon . Muriel just looked at him . So he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Muriel burst out crying . That surprised him , and for a moment he felt a little surge of terror from an ancient part of him . What was he losing , that mortals started surprising him ? He had n't been paying attention . It had been easy to see them clearly , in the old days , like dangling string above a kitten , knowing how the kitten would jump . Now he 'd fallen into a mysterious country . He put his arms around her , and she bowed her head to push her forehead into his shoulder . " You fool , you fool , " she sobbed , " I do n't need no baby , I just want you . " Like a fist , some kind of joy or sadness forced its way from Ivan 's chest up through his throat and out through his face . Its passage was sudden and unexpected , and Ivan sighed . He did not know who he was anymore . They held each other . Her tears cooled his shoulder , and he could feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tears , unbidden , cool on his cheeks . " Ivan , " Muriel said in a throaty whisper , " You tell me straight now . I do n't want your good intentions , I want the truth . Is there any hope for that little girl ? Can you undo what you did ? " It was safe here , in Muriel 's arms . In this safe place , he thought about the plan he 'd made on the walk back home , and he could smell its stink of pride - the pride of princes . Muriel felt it in the silence , and she stiffened . " You mortals , " he said , the words muddy in his throat , " you walk around with this huge - emptiness in you , like wanting back into the womb . You think we 'll fill it . Once you get that hunger ... you do n't let go . You 'll die for us , but you wo n't leave us . Maybe I can make her forget , but the hunger stays . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off with her ? " She shook her head . " Or you go off with her alone ? Is she going to get better ? " " I do n't know . " Muriel pulled away . " Good Lord , Ivan ! Guess ! " He looked at his hands . " I think she 'll be something like a child , and something like a prize , and maybe that 'll twist her up . " He could feel his cheeks get hot . " No . She wo n't get better . And I 'll have to be ... what I was . " Muriel shook , her eyes closed . She put her hands over her face . " Oh Jesus , oh Jesus , " she said . Ivan said nothing . She wiped her tears on her apron . " I ca n't give you up willingly , " she said . " God forgive me . I ca n't make you stay . And I ca n't follow you into that . " " I know , " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry , of the preacher , of Bob Pratchett the white foreman at the mill . How long before he damned them all ? He was a fool . She saw it in his face . " Ivan . Listen to me . You got to leave folks alone . " She reached a hand out to touch his cheek . " And you can , I know you can . You ai n't no demon , Ivan . You 're just a sinner like everybody else . " He kissed her , and took her close . He squeezed his eyes shut and smelled the salt of her tears , mixed in with dish soap and sweat and vanilla and the spice of cedar wood . Then he blew his nose into the paper napkin and wiped the sweat from his brow . She looked away from him , down at the table , as he got up and left the kitchen . Sarah was sitting dutifully in the twilight , looking out onto the dark oval of water and the first eager stars that blinked above it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anticipation . " It 's time to go home , " Ivan said . She shook her head , unsure if she had heard him correctly . He offered his hand and she took it . Her fingers were cold from the outside air and the ice cream inside her . They walked through the ragged grass over the hill . In her face was a wolfish joy - she was soaking him in with her eyes . Somewhere behind that need was that lonely little girl , brave enough to pray in a lonely cemetery . His chest throbbed with pain . Her lips shivered and her teeth clicked together . He wanted to give her his jacket , but how could she forget him then ? They reached the road . He let go her hand . He stepped back from her and slouched , scratching his head . He spoke in a new tone that was neither paternal nor comforting , but like that green-eyed nigger who lived in the house by the pond . " Well , I hope you enjoyed your dessert . Now run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He saw the arrow of panic as it stabbed through her . Where was her Ivan ? Where was her angel sent ? Who was this man ? " No , no , " she said , looking around her . Her head was foggy . She wiped at her eyes . She looked at him : some harmless nigger standing with her under the cold night sky . She stepped away . " What - " Ivan forced himself to turn and wave respectfully , to walk away . When he glanced back , Sarah was hugging herself . Her thoughts burned the air . A moment ago she had been saved , she had had a father and a home . Had she been with Jesus ? No , she 'd eaten with some niggers - shame leapt burning to her cheeks . She pushed past a fence post and began to run . God had seen her , seen her naked soul , seen everything there was of her to love , and abandoned her . He did not love her at all . The lost soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivan 's belly as he crossed over the hill to his house . He pulled his jacket around him and stared ahead . Muriel had turned the porch light on so that he would not stumble .
