Before the clothes can make the man these men make the clothes . // In the clothing business for which Italy is world famous , fabric is the commodity that affects the entire industry-especially in terms of quality and research . One of the fundamental elements that help maintain the high quality of Italian fashion is each textile company 's ability to innovate and develop new technologies . Although the current economic situation of the textile market is not so prosperous , it is booming in quality and research , which in this field are guarantees of continuing progress . To learn more about this , and to understand how Italian firms in the textile sector are evolving , we interviewed three experts who represent the places where the best fabrics of the world are produced . These traditional centers of fabric making are Biella for wool and cashmere ; Como for silk and printed patterns ; and Prato , which produces fabrics of all types , but which is most famous for its truly extraordinary finishing . Our three " lords of fabric " are Sergio Loro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Biella ; Fabio Bellotti , founder of Rainbow and currently a consultant to Ratti of Como ; and Mario Traversi , owner of Lanificio Tessilclub in Prato . Sergio Loro Piana stands by the quality and innovation that have always been part of his firm 's history , and which are his highest priority . The cloth Tasmania , which Loro Piana registered in 1975 , represented a groundbreaking invention . It was created as an intelligent solution for the needs of people like Sergio : a fabric that can be worn with style and nonchalance in any climate , a fabric for which seasons do not exist . Sergio tells the story of the birth of Tasmania : A very important American buyer had been asking his father for a fabric with very specific characteristics . One day , he saw the very light fabric that Loro Piana was then producing exclusively for the clergy , and said , " I want this . " Sergio 's father adjusted it slightly , calling it " priest cloth , " and thus was born Tasmania , a cloth that weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams . The difficulty , however , was that all the other fabric manufacturers were still producing " heavy " cloth at the time . This new cloth was more difficult to handle , even in the sewing , as it required different textile equipment . The workers at Loro Diana were forced to give away pieces of Tasmania to those who did n't want it , in order to teach them how to sew and treat it . Loro Diana finally convinced of textile equipment manufacturers to modify their machines so that they could handle Tasmania . Since then , things have changed so much that now the fabric defines dress in the western world . Loro Diana sought to innovate with cashmere as well , when it decided to buy the raw material locally rather than import it . Again , equipment producers were forced to alter their looms to enable them to process this material in a different way . But after that , all the other firms were quick to follow suit , because they realized , " If Loro Piana does this , we could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came about as the answer to a question Sergio posed to himself : " I asked , Why , when I am accustomed to dressing in a natural , human , and elegant manner , do I find only plastic clothes for leisure wear ? ' So in 1997 , we patented the Storm System , which has allowed us to use our soft , refined materials for outerwear , in snow , in rain , for boating , for skiing . We work with Gore , which has developed for us a very thin membrane that gives our cashmere exceptional performance in the roughest climatic conditions . It 's waterproof and retains warmth while allowing the fabric to breathe . Now we want to make hosiery in Storm System cashmere , and to find a way to stop water on one 's sweater when one is playing golf . " Sergio makes another important point : " Creativity and innovation put us on the map , not just by increasing profits , but also by shielding us from Asian competition , which is better with man-made fabrics than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loro Piana 's continuing innovation : actual finished clothing and accessories , with the same Loro Piana label that consumers have seen on the fabric for years , and now find in shops throughout the world . Fabio Bellotti , a great silk connoisseur , cites Ratti of Como as the most important Italian silk  --  producing firm . For him , one of the strengths of the firm , beyond its enormous archive of prints , is its ability to print any design at any level and on any cloth . In the past , Ratti , like the other silk producers in the Como area , printed large quantities of silk for the production of ties . Now this is no longer the case , because Asian firms are able to print silk at minimal cost . Therefore , the quality of printed ties has declined significantly . For this reason , in Como today , the mark of honor is to produce silk for ties in plain colors that are woven with jacquard or other special procedures , in order to obtain an extraordinary result difficult to duplicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rainbow , has worked with very high-quality silk on the presses for the greatest Italian and foreign silk makers , from Albinos Walter to Issey Miyake . Now , at Ratti , he is experimenting with printing on cutting-edge varieties of polyester , for the " feelgood " line that is the firm 's future . In his view , Ratti and Etro have learned to adapt , to experiment and take risks ; they have become more international , and today they are in the best position to face the future and the competition . Many firms in Como have invested heavily in technology , which is currently very important in the processing of silk . The Como firms remain the best in the world because they can be all things to all people ; they are flexible and can produce extraordinary fabrics . Costs , however , can become extraordinarily high , but are justified by the exclusivity of the fabrics . The challenge , then , is to propose original designs in a selection that is not too large and therefore not too expensive to produce . Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest man who prefers to speak of his work as a member of a firm , not as an individual . He tells us that the city of Prato is a leader in research that has made many advances , from the production of more practical materials to the most advanced experimentation . All fabrics are produced here-wool , cotton , linen , synthetic materials-but what is most important is Prato 's inventive ways of finishing . Vittorio Solbiati has been a partner in Tessilclub for ten years ; he makes an important contribution to the firm in terms of research and creativity . For Traversi , Prato has come so far simply in order to survive : Because the city depends on fabric for its livelihood , it is forced to place itself at the forefront of innovation . He says , " Our customers have always been of the highest creative caliber , and they come to us because we offer a strong product ; we do n't have to go to them . With us they find all sorts of items-it 's like a bazaar , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual items here . Weaving is a big activity for us ; there are many sophisticated looms . " We keep abreast of developments everywhere because we work with customers who themselves are very well informed , and they help us . We know things at the right time . My firm has been in existence for 30 years , and it started with a passion for research and innovation . We are positive about the future and we are ready , along with our colleagues in Prato , to conquer new markets , first of all in America , where consumers are being educated to appreciate our raw materials .
