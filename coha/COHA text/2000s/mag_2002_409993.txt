Section : COVER STORY How the courts killed good detective work <p> Think the cops are having a tough time cracking the Chandra Levy case ? Try this one on for size . <p> Samiya Haqiqi , a 24-year-old law student at Quinnipiac College in Connecticut , drove to New York City on a Friday night in November 1999 to meet her boyfriend for dinner . She intended to break up with him . The next day her car was found abandoned in a Grand Union supermarket parking lot . She has not been seen since . <p> Suspicion quickly fell on the boyfriend . He claimed she never made the dinner engagement . When police asked further questions , he hired an attorney and invoked his Fifth Amendment rights . Although Haqiqi 's relatives urged the Queens district attorney to issue a search warrant for the boyfriend 's apartment , the D.A . refused , saying there was no " probable cause . " Shortly afterward , the boyfriend moved to Canada . <p> A year later , the Queens detective bureau announced that Haqiqi was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend was the suspect ; but nothing happened . Last week , Detective Steven Brown of the 109th Precinct said the boyfriend still remains the principal suspect-but no arrest is imminent . " It 's generally more helpful when the suspect cooperates during an investigation , " he said . Any physical evidence that would tie the boyfriend to the disappearance is , of course , long gone . <p> At the heart of the Chandra Levy case is a grim fact of life : We are living in the post-Columbo era . Many traditional aspects of detective work have been abandoned ; in fact , much of what detectives once did is now illegal . The only thing that keeps the wheels of justice turning is that most people do n't know this . " People only talk to the police because they think it will look suspicious if they do n't , " says an experienced Manhattan assistant district attorney . " What they do n't realize is that the police are n't allowed to draw that negative inference . " <p> Defense attorneys , of course , know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hear them holler that a defendant " was n't properly represented " when someone is convicted of a crime , particularly a death-penalty case . It 's true : If all Americans knew their rights , very few people would ever be arrested for anything . <p> This situation is the outcome of the 1960s Supreme Court reforms , particularly Mapp v. Ohio ( 1961 ) and Miranda v. Arizona ( 1966 ) . Mapp extended the Fourth Amendment 's search-and-seizure protections and search-warrant requirements to the states . Miranda extended the Fifth Amendment 's protections against self-incrimination all the way back to the police station , establishing the " right to remain silent . " Both decisions were reinforced by an " exclusionary rule , " which said that if a defendant 's rights were violated in the course of an investigation , the resulting evidence must be excluded from court . <p> Since that moment , the main strategy of every defense attorney has become to " put the state on trial " by challenging investigative procedures . As a result , absurdities have prevailed . Warrants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessions recorded on videotape were thrown out when defense attorneys said their client " could n't have possibly understood his rights or else he would n't have admitted to this crime . " <p> Now something even worse has happened . District attorneys and police departments have become very good at abiding by the new rules ; procedural mistakes are rare , and D.A . ' s are very circumspect in asking for search warrants . There 's only one problem : Now that the police are abiding by the letter of the Supreme Court directives , there are more and more unsolved crimes . <p> This is the clear and disastrous consequence of the Court 's misinterpretation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments . As the Fifth Amendment now stands , no one has to cooperate with the police . You do n't even have to give the police your first and last names . If you are caught in a compromising situation or even standing over a bloody corpse , all you have to say is , " Talk to my lawyer . " Your lawyer , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not the difficult part . The real problem is that the police are not allowed to draw any negative inference from this refusal to answer questions . In other words , the police are n't allowed to think-and that makes a crucial difference when it comes to asking for search warrants . The Fourth Amendment says that " no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause . " What constitutes probable cause ? It ca n't be a hunch . It ca n't be just circumstantial evidence : The fact that someone is standing over a bloody corpse does n't mean he 's done anything wrong ; he could have just happened by . If the suspect declines to give any explanation of the circumstances , there may be no grounds for initiating an investigation . Detective work quickly hits a stone wall . <p> Here 's how it works in practice . On November 7 , 1997 , Michael Sullivan , a 54-year-old actor and art-gallery clerk , and Camden Sylvia , a 36-year-old artist and real-estate agent , who shared a Lower Manhattan apartment , mysteriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodriguez , who ran a locksmith shop on the building 's first floor . Sullivan and Sylvia had long been at odds with Rodriguez over their $300-a-month rent-stabilized apartment . The couple claimed he was not providing them with heat , and had told him that day that they would be withholding their rent . <p> On November 15 , police set up an interview with Rodriguez to pick up the keys so they could search the couple 's apartment . Rodriguez never showed up ; indeed , he disappeared altogether . Manhattan police determined that he lived on seven acres in upstate Orange County , and asked Orange County police to search the property . Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau decided , however , that there was not " probable cause " for a search-and no warrant was issued . Without a warrant , Orange County cops could only send dogs to sniff the perimeter and fly helicopters over the property looking for freshly turned earth . ( Both searches , incidentally , were probably illegal . ) <p> On November 24 , Rodriguez 's van turned up , parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van . They contacted Rodriguez 's wife , but she refused to let them search it . Once again , D.A . Morgenthau ruled there was no " probable cause " for a search , and the van was released without being checked for evidence . Meanwhile , it was discovered that one David King , a former Rodriguez employee , had also disappeared mysteriously in 1991 in the midst of a dispute with the locksmith . King has never been found . <p> On December 9 , Rodriguez resurfaced in the company of his lawyer . He met with police but refused to answer any questions . By this time friends and family of the missing couple were picketing the D.A . ' s office demanding action , but Morgenthau still refused to request a warrant . The case came to a dead end . The couple has never been found . <p> Such " unsolved mysteries " are now becoming routine . In the JonBenet Ramsey case , the parents initially told police the little girl was missing . While the police were searching the house , the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upstairs , effectively destroying the crime scene . A highly suspect ransom note was found . Most compelling , there were no footprints leading to or from the house-in a fresh snowfall . Both parents were obviously suspects , but they did n't sit down with police for separate interrogations until months later-after extensive negotiations . <p> When Manhattan PR superstar Lizzie Grubman backed her van into a crowd at a nightclub on Long Island , she quickly fled the scene . Less than an hour later , someone called the police and said where she could be found-apparently in an attempt to help her avoid charges of leaving the scene . When police picked her up , however , she refused to say anything . Because the police could not even establish that she had been in the car , there was no probable cause for administering a Breathalyzer test . Thus she avoided charges of driving while under the influence . <p> The Supreme Court 's great mistake-the one that led to all these absurd consequences-was in assuming that interrogations involved beating confessions out of people . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the main purpose of interrogations was to get statements from the suspect that could be verified as true or false . It was not forced admissions , but rather falsehoods and contradictions , that incriminated people . Many an episode of Columbo ended with the guilty party suddenly realizing he has been caught in a lie . Crescendo . Fade to black . Commercial . It was simple and elegant . <p> The little-noticed anomaly of the Chandra Levy case is that Congressman Gary Condit has been required to give an account of himself . Legally , he did not have to let the police search his apartment . Nor did he have to say a word about his relationship with the intern . The hearsay evidence from Levy 's relatives about their relationship probably would n't constitute " probable cause " for an investigation . It is only because of his high profile as a congressman that he has been pressured into cooperating with police . <p> What is truly ironic is that , even as the courts have limited detectives ' work on criminal cases , the investigative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Olson documents in his book The Litigation Explosion , over the last 30 years the " interrogation " and " search-and-seizure " powers of trial lawyers have been broadened beyond recognition . <p> Depositions-originally a means of recording the testimony of people who could n't physically make it to court-have become an all-purpose interrogation tool for private attorneys . If you are sued for divorce or charged with sexual harassment , you can be required to sit with the plaintiff attorney and answer questions pertaining to your sex life , your personal affairs , or any and all private matters . You have no right to remain silent . Failure to cooperate can result in contempt of court . All you can do is hire your own lawyer to advise you . You must open your bank account and complete financial records . You must submit to examination by a hostile psychiatrist and give hair , blood , and urine samples to check for drug abuse or venereal diseases . In Olson 's words , " there 's a presumption in favor of intrusiveness . " <p> The discovery process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure from the civil bar , the federal rules of civil procedure were amended to allow litigators access to any and all private papers . Once severely limited in scope , discovery procedures now allow plaintiff attorneys to search for anything they choose . Plaintiffs can demand corporate records going back 50 years . They can summon individual diaries , notebooks , or random doodlings . In a divorce case , you can be asked to provide names of all visitors to your house since the separation . " All this offers plenty of room for ' fishing expeditions , ' where incriminating evidence turns up by serendipity , " says Olson . Such random searches , of course , are exactly what the Fifth Amendment was designed to protect against ; but there are no Fifth Amendment rights in civil cases . <p> What 's going on ? The obvious answer is that lawyers have seized control of the system and are running it for their own benefit . In criminal law , district attorneys are salaried public servants with very little financial stake in the system . Defense attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good record among indigent defendants and then switching to wealthy clients . Many of the best defense attorneys are now becoming all-purpose public-relations agents , holding press conferences , conducting their own investigations , casting aspersions on other suspects , and issuing daily statements that begin , " My client says " <p> On the civil side , however , it is the plaintiff attorneys who are the high rollers . Countless lawyers have become rich bringing " strike suits " against small technology companies that let their earnings slip , or class-action suits on asbestos or breast implants . Expanded discovery and depositions are the tools of the trade ; under these circumstances , it is not at all surprising to find the whole legal profession coming down on the side of limiting police procedures while expanding the investigative powers of plaintiffs . <p> The only loser is the public interest-specifically , the broadly diffused interest that everyone has in seeing crimes solved . " I do n't know about you but I 'm getting tired of bad police work , " says commentator Bill O'Reilly . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in her own home , what can they do ? " Unfortunately , it 's not bad police work we 're viewing . It 's the new American justice system . <p> Of course , even this system has its limits . The Manhattan D.A . ' s office eventually got sick of taking criticism on the Rodriguez case and started an investigation of the locksmith 's tax records . It managed to convict Rodriguez on charges of tax evasion and credit-card fraud . He is now doing eight years ; everyone knows he is actually doing time for a double murder for which he has never been tried . <p> The original Mapp and Miranda decisions hoped to end " arbitrary " procedures by the police . Stretched beyond all logical limits , however , they have produced a justice system that is even more arbitrary and capricious-a clear and present danger to the public good . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By William Tucker <p> <p> Mr. Yucker is the author of Vigilante : The Backlash Against Crime in America . <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
