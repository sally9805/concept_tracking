The village of Ardmore sat snug on the south coast of Ireland , in the county of Waterford , with the Celtic Sea spread out at its feet . The stone seawall curved around , following the skirt of the golden-sand beach . It boasted in its vicinity a pretty jut of cliffs upholstered with wild grass , and a hotel that clung to them . If one had a mind to , it was a pleasant if hearty walk on a narrow path around the headland , and at the top of the first hill were the ruins of the oratory and well of Saint Declan . The view was worth the climb , with sky and sea and village spread out below . This was holy ground , and though dead were buried there , only one grave had its stone marked . The village itself claimed neat streets and painted cottages , some with the traditional thatched roofs , and a number of steep hills as well . Flowers grew in abundance , spilling out of window boxes , baskets , and pots , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , and the villagers were proud to have won the Tidy Town award two years running . Atop Tower Hill was a fine example of a round tower , with its conical top still in place , and the ruins of the twelfth-century cathedral built in honor of Saint Declan . Folks would tell you , in case you wondered , that Declan arrived thirty years before good Saint Patrick . Not that they were bragging , they were just letting you know how things stood . Those interested in such matters would find examples of ogham carving on the stones put for safekeeping inside the rooflesscathedral , and Roman arcading faded with time and wind but still worth the study . But the village itself made no attempt at such grandeur . It was merely a pleasant place with a shop or two and a scatter of cottages built back away from lovely sand beaches . The sign for Ardmore said FAILTE , and that was " welcome . " It was that very combination of ancient history and simple character and hospitality that interested Trevor Magee . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his grandfather had been born here , in a small house very near Ardmore Bay , had lived the first years of his life breathing that moist sea air , had perhaps held his mother 's hand as she 'd walked to the shops or along the surf . His grandfather had left his village and his country , taking his wife and young son with him to America . He had never been back , and so far as Trevor knew , had never looked back either . There had been a distance and a bitter one , between the old man and the country of his birth . Ireland and Ardmore and the family Dennis Magee had left behind had rarely been spoken of . So Trevor 's image of Ardmore had a ripple of sentiment and curiosity through it , and his reasons for choosing it had a personal bent . But he could afford personal bents . He was a man who built , and who , as his grandfather and father before him , built cleverly and well . His grandfather had made his living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during and after World War II , until the buying and selling of them was his business , and the building done by those he hired . Old Magee had been no more sentimental about his laborer 's beginnings than he had been about his homeland . To Trevor 's recollection , the man had shown no sentiment about anything . But Trevor had inherited the heart and hands of the builder as much as the cool , hard sense of the businessman , and he had learned to use both . He would use them both here , and a dash of sentiment as well , to build his theater , a traditional structure for traditional music , with its entrance the already established pub known as Gallagher 's . The deal with the Gallaghers had been set , the ground broken for the project before he 'd been able to hack through his schedule for the time he wanted to spend here . But he was here now , and he intended to do more than sign checks and watch . He wanted his hands in it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a temperate climate when he spent a morning hauling concrete . That morning Trevor left the cottage he 'd decided to rent for the duration of his stay wearing a denim jacket and carrying a steaming mug of coffee . Now , a handful of hours later , the jacket had been tossed aside , and a thin line of damp ran front and back down his shirt . He 'd have paid a hundred pounds for one cold beer . The pub was only a short walk through the construction rubble . He knew from stopping in the day before that it did a brisk business midday . But a man could hardly quench his thirst with a chilly Harp when he forbade his employees to drink on the job . He rolled his shoulders , circled his neck as he scanned the site . The concrete truck let out its continuous rumble , men shouted , relaying orders or acknowledging them . Job music , Trevor thought . He never tired of it . That was a gift from his father . Learn from the ground up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magee had done just that . For more than ten yearsfifteen if he counted the summers he 'd sweated on construction siteshe 'd learned just what went into the business of building . The backaches and blood and aching muscles . At thirty-two , he spent more time in boardrooms and meetings than on a scaffold , but he 'd never lost the appreciation , or the satisfaction of swinging his own hammer . He intended to indulge himself doing just that in Ardmore , in his theater . He watched the small woman in a faded cap and battered boots circle around , gesture as the wet concrete slid down the chute . She scrambled over sand and stone , used her shovel to rap the chute and alert the operator to stop , then waded into the muck with the other laborers to shovel and smooth . Brenna O'Toole , Trevor thought , and was glad he 'd followed his instincts there . Hiring her and her father as foremen on the project had been the right course of action . Not just for their building skills , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in it , kept the job running smoothly and the men happy and productive . Public relations on this sort of project were just as vital as a sturdy foundation . Yes , indeed , they were working out well . His three days in Ardmore had shown him he 'd made the right choice with O'Toole and O'Toole . When Brenna climbed out again , Trevor stepped over , extended a hand to give her a final boost . " Thanks . " She sliced her shovel into the ground , leaned on it , and despite her filthy boots and faded cap , looked like a pixie . Her skin was pure Irish cream , and a few curls of wild red escaped the cap . " Tim Riley says we wo n't have rain for another day or two , and he has a way of being right about such things more than he 's wrong . I think we 'll have the slab set up for you before you have to worry about weather . " " You made considerable progress before I got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high sign there was no reason to wait . We 'll have you a good , solid foundation , Mr. Magee , and on schedule . " " Trev . " " Aye , Trev . " She tipped back her cap , then her head so she could meet his eyes . She figured him a good foot higher than her five-two , even wearing her boots . " The men you sent along from America , they 're a fine team . " " As I handpicked them , I agree . " She thought his voice faintly aloof , but not unfriendly . " And do you never pick females then ? " He smiled slowly so it seemed that humor just moseyed over his face until it reached eyes the color of turf smoke . " I do indeed and as often as possible . Both on and off the job . I 've put one of my best carpenters on this project . She 'll be here next week . " " It 's good to know my cousin Brian was n't wrong in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender . It 's a good morning 's work here , " she added , nodding to the site . " That noisy bastard of a truck will be our constant companion for a while yet . Darcy 'll be back from her holiday tomorrow , and I can tell you she 'll bitch our ears off about the din . " " It 's a good noise . Building . " " I 've always thought the same . " They stood a moment in perfect accord while the truck vomited out the last yard of concrete . " I 'll buy you lunch , " Trevor said . " I 'll let you . " Brenna gave a whistle to catch her father 's attention , then mimed spooning up food . Mick responded with a grin and a wave , then went back to work . " He 's in his heaven , " Brenna commented as they walked over to rinse off their boots . " Nothing makes Mick O'Toole happier than finding himself in the middle of a job site , the muckier the better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomps , then headed around to the kitchen door . " I hope you 'll take some time to see the area while you 're here , instead of locking yourself into the job at hand . " " I plan to see what 's around . " He had reports , of coursedetailed reports on tourist draws , road conditions , routes to and from major cities . But he intended to see for himself . Needed to see it , Trevor admitted to himself . Something had been pulling him toward Ireland , toward Ardmore , for more than a year . In dreams . " Ah , now there 's a fine-looking man doing what he does best , " Brenna said when she pushed open the kitchen door . " What have you for us today , Shawn ? " He turned from the enormous old stove , a rangy man with shaggy black hair and eyes of misty blue . " For the special we 've sea spinach soup and the beef sandwich . Good day to you , Trevor . Is this one working you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . " " And so I must , for the man in my life is slow . I wonder , Shawn , if you 've selected another tune or two for Trevor 's consideration . " " I 've been busy catering to my new wife . She 's a demanding creature . " So saying , he reached out to cradle Brenna 's face and kiss her . " Get out of my kitchen . It 's confusing enough around here without Darcy . " " She 'll be back tomorrow , and by this time of the day you 'll have cursed her a dozen times . " " Why do you think I miss her ? Give your order to Sinead , " he told Trevor . " She 's a good girl , and our Jude 's been working with her . She just needs a bit more practice . " " A friend of my sister Mary Kate is Sinead , " Brenna told Trevor as she pushed open the door that swung between kitchen and pub . " A good-natured girl , if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy O'Hara , and that is the sum total of her ambitions at this time . " " And what does Billy O'Hara have to say ? " " Being not quite so ambitious as Sinead , Billy keeps his mouth shut . Good day to you , Aidan . " " And to you . " The oldest of the Gallaghers worked the bar and had his hands on the taps as he looked over . " Will you be joining us for lunch , then ? " " That we will . We 've caught you busy . " " God bless the tour buses . " With a wink , Aidan slid two pints down the bar to waiting hands . " Do you want us to take it in the kitchen ? " " No need for that unless you 're in a great hurry . " His eyes , a deeper blue than his brother 's , scanned the pub . " Service is a mite slower than our usual . But there 's a table or two left . " " We 'll leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How will you have it ? " " Let 's get a table . " The better to watch how the business ran . He followed her out and sat with her at one of the mushroom-shaped tables . There was a buzz of conversation , a haze of smoke , and the yeasty scent of beer . " Will you have a pint ? " Brenna asked him . " Not until after the workday . " Her lips twitched as she kicked back in her chair . " So I 've heard from some of the men . Word is you 're a tyrant on this particular matter . " He did n't mind the term " tyrant . " It meant he was in control . " Word would be correct . " " I 'll tell you this , you may have a bit of a problem enforcing such a rule around here . Many who 'll labor for you were nursed on Guinness and it 's as natural to them as mother 's milk . " " I 'm fond of it myself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stick with mother 's milk . " " Ah , you 're a hard man , Trevor Magee . " But she said it with a laugh . " So tell me , how are you liking Faerie Hill Cottage ? " " Very much . It 's comfortable , efficient , quiet , and has a view that rips your heart into your throat . It 's just what I was looking for , so I 'm grateful you put me on to it . " " That 's not a problem , not a problem at all . It 's in the family . I think Shawn misses the little kitchen there , as the house we 're building 's far from finished . More than livable , " she added , as it was one of their current sore points , " but I figure to concentrate on the kitchen there on my off days so he 'll be happier . " " I 'd like to see it . " " Would you ? " Surprised , she angled her head . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Do you mind me saying I did n't expect you to be as friendly a sort of man as you seem to be ? " " What did you expect ? " " More of a shark , and I hope that does n't offend you . " " It does n't . And it depends on the waters where I 'm swimming . " He glanced over , and his face warmed as Aidan 's wife came up to the table . But When he started to rise , Jude waved him down again . " No , I 'm not joining you , but thanks . " She rested a hand on her very pregnant belly . " Hello , I 'm Jude Frances and I 'll be your server today . " " You should n't be on your feet like this , carrying trays . " Jude sighed as she took out her order pad . " He sounds like Aidan . I put my feet up when I need to , and I do n't carry anything heavy . Sinead ca n't handle things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevor . Why me own blessed mother dug potatoes on the day I was born , then went back to roast them after the delivery . " At Trevor 's narrowed glance , Brenna chuckled . " Well , maybe not , but I 'll wager she could have . I 'll have today 's soup , if you do n't mind , Jude , and a glass of milk , " she added with a wicked smile for Trevor . " The same , " he said , " plus the sandwich . " " A fine choice . I 'll be right back with it . " " She 's stronger than she looks , " Brenna told him when Jude moved to another table . " And more stubborn . Now that she 's found her direction , so to speak , she 'll only work harder to prove she can do what you tell her she should n't . Aidan wo n't let her overdo , I promise you . The man adores her . " " Yes , I 've noticed . The Gallagher men seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd better be , or their women will know why . " Relaxed , she kicked back , pulled off her cap . Those red curls tumbled down . " So you are n't finding it , I guess we 'd say too rustic ' for youout in the countryside here after being used to New York City ? " He thought of the job sites he 'd experienced : mud slides , floods , blistering heat , petty vandalism , and sabotage . " Not at all . The village is exactly what I expected after Finkle 's reports . " " Ah , yes , Finkle . " She remembered Trevor 's scout very well . " Now there 's a man I believe prefers urban conveniences . But you 're not so ... particular , then . " " I 'm very particular , depending . That 's why I incorporated most of your design into the theater project . " " Now that 's a fine and sneaky compliment . " And nothing could have pleased her more . " I suppose I was angling more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage on Faerie Hill , and I was n't sure you 'd find the place to your liking . Thinking , I suppose , a man with your background and wherewithal would be more inclined to settle at the cliff hotel with maid service and the restaurant and so forth . " " Hotel rooms become confining . And I find it interesting to stay in the house where the woman who was engaged to one of my ancestors was born , and lived , and died . " " She was a fine woman , Old Maude . A wise woman . " Brenna kept her eyes on Trevor 's face as she spoke . " Her grave 's up near the well of Saint Declan , and it 's there you can feel her . She 's not the one in the cottage now . " " Who is ? " Brenna lifted her eyebrows . " You do n't know the legend , then ? Your grandfather was born here , and your father as well , though he was a babe when they sailed to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of them tell you the story of Lady Gwen and Prince Carrick ? " " No . So it would be Lady Gwen who haunts the cottage ? " " Have you seen her ? " " No . " Trevor had n't been raised on legends and myths , but there was more than enough Irish in his blood to cause him to wonder about them . " But there 's a feminine feel to the place , almost a fragrance , so odds are for the lady . " " You 'd be right about that . " " Who was she ? I figure if I 'm sharing quarters with a ghost , I should know something about her . " No careless dismissal of the subject , no amused indulgence of the Irish and their legends , Brenna noted . Just cool interest . " You surprise me again . Let me see to something first . I 'll be right back . " Fascinating , Trevor mused . He had himself a ghost . He 'd felt things before . In old buildings , empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing a man generally talked about at a board meeting or over a cold one with the crew after a sweaty day 's work . Not usually . But this was a different place , with a different tone . More , he wanted to know . Everything to do with Ardmore and the area was of interest to him now . A good ghost story could draw people in just as successfully as a well-run pub . It was all atmosphere . Gallagher 's was exactly the kind of atmosphere he 'd been looking for as a segue into his theater . The old wood , blackened by time and smoke and grease , mated comfortably with the cream-colored walls , the stone hearth , the low tables and benches . The bar itself was a beauty , an aged chestnut that he 'd already noted the Gallaghers kept wiped and polished . The age of customers ranged from a baby in arms to the oldest man Trevor believed he 'd ever seen , who was balanced on a stool at the far end of the bar . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they sat or smoked or sipped , and three times that many who could be nothing other than tourists with their camera bags under their tables and their maps and guidebooks out . The conversations were a mix of accents , but predominant was that lovely lilt he 'd heard in his grandparents ' voices until the day they died . He wondered if they had n't missed hearing it themselves , and why they 'd never had a driving urge to come to Ireland again . What were the bitter memories that had kept them away ? Whatever , curiosity about them had skipped over a generation and now had caused him to come back and see for himself . More , he wondered why he should have recognized Ardmore and the view from the cottage and even now know what he would see when he climbed the cliffs . It was as if he carried a picture in his mind of this place , one someone else had taken and tucked away for him . They 'd had no pictures to show him . His father had visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but his descriptions had been sketchy at best . The reports , of course . There had been detailed photographs and descriptions in the reports Finkle had brought back to New York . But he 'd knownbefore he 'd opened the first file , he 'd already known . Inherited memory ? he mused , though he did n't put much stock in that sort of thing . Inheriting his father 's eyes , the clear gray color , the long-lidded shape of them , was one matter . And he was told he had his grandfather 's hands , and his mind for business . But how did a memory pass down through the blood ? He toyed with the idea as he continued to scan the room . It did n't occur to him that he looked more the local than the tourist as he sat there in his work clothes , his dark blond hair tousled from the morning 's labor . He had a narrow , rawboned face that would put most in mind of a warrior , or perhaps a scholar , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it looked to be honed and sculpted by some wild genius . The faintest of scars marred his chin , a result of a storm of flying glass during a tornado in Houston , and added to the overall impression of toughness . It was a face that rarely gave anything away . Unless it was to Trevor Magee 's advantage . At the moment it held a cool and remote expression , but it shifted into easy friendliness when Brenna came back toward the table with Jude . Brenna , he noted , carried the tray . " I 've asked Jude to take a few moments to sit and tell you about Lady Gwen , " Brenna began and was already unloading the order . " She 's a seanachais . " At Trevor 's raised eyebrow , Jude shook her head . " It 's Gaelic for storyteller . I 'm not really , I 'm just " " And who has a book being published , and another she 's writing . Jude 's book 'll be out at the end of this very summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely gift , so I 'd keep it in mind when you 're out shopping . " " Brenna . " Jude rolled her eyes . " I 'll look for it . Some of Shawn 's song lyrics are stories . It 's an old and honored tradition . " " Oh , he 'll like that one . " Beaming now , Brenna scooped up the tray . " I 'll deal with this , Jude , and give Sinead a bit of a goose for you . Go ahead and get started . I 've heard it often enough before . " " She has enough energy for twenty people . " A little tired now , Jude picked up her cup of tea . " I 'm glad I found her for this project . Or that she found me . " " I 'd say it was a bit of both , since you 're both operators . " She caught herself , winced . " I did n't mean that in a negative way . " " Was n't taken in one . Baby kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevor explained , " My sister just had her third . " " Third ? " Jude blew out a breath . " There are moments I wonder how I 'm going to manage the one . He 's active . But he 's just going to have to wait another couple of months . " She ran a hand in slow circles over the mound of her belly , soothing as she sipped . " You may not know it , but I lived in Chicago until just over a year ago . " He made a noncommittal sound . Of course he knew , he had extensive reports . " My plan was to come here for six months , to live in the cottage where my grandmother lived after she lost her parents . She 'd inherited it from her cousin Maude , who 'd died shortly before I came here . " " The woman my great-uncle was engaged to . " " Yes . The day I arrived , it was raining . I thought I was lost . I had been lost , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came alone , to another country ? " Trevor cocked his head . " That does n't sound like a woman easily unnerved . " " That 's something Aidan would say . " And because it was , she found herself very comfortable . " I suppose it 's more that I did n't know my own nerve at that point . In any case , I pulled into the street , the driveway actually , of this little thatched-roof cottage . And in the upstairs window I saw a woman . She had a lovely , sad face and pale blond hair that fell around her shoulders . She looked at me , our eyes connected . Then Brenna drove up . It seemed I 'd stumbled across my Own cottage , and the woman I 'd seen in the window was Lady Gwen . " " The ghost ? " " That 's right , yes . It sounds impossible , does n't it ? Or certainly unreasonable . But I can tell you exactly what she looked like . I 've sketched her . And I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you appear to know now . " " I 'd like to hear it . " " Then I 'll tell you . " Jude paused as Brenna came back , sat , and tucked into her meal . She had an easy way with a story , Trevor noted . A smooth and natural rhythm that put the listener into the tale . She told him of a young maid who 'd lived in the cottage on the faerie hill . A woman who cared for her father , as her mother had been lost in childbirth , who tended the cottage and its gardens and who carried herself with pride . Beneath the green slope of the hill was the silver glory of the faerie raft , the palace where Carrick ruled as prince . He was also proud , and he was handsome , with a flowing mane of raven-black hair and eyes of burning blue . Those eyes fell upon the maid Gwen , and hers upon him . They plunged into love , faerie and mortal , and at night when others slept , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they speak of that love , for pride blocked the words . One night Gwen 's father woke to see her with Carrick as they dismounted from his horse . And in fear for her , he betrothed her to another and ordered her to marry without delay . Carrick flew on his horse to the sun , and gathered its burning sparks in his silver pouch . When Gwen came out of the cottage to meet him before her wedding , he opened the bag and poured diamonds , jewels of the sun , at her feet . " Take them and me , " he said , " for they are my passion for you . " He promised her immortality , and a life of riches and glory . But never once did he speak , even then , of love . So she refused him , and turned from him . The diamonds that lay on the grass became flowers . Twice more he came to her , the next time when she carried her first child in her womb . From his silver pouch he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered for her . And these , he told her , were his longing for her . But longing is not love , and she had pledged herself to another . When she turned away , the pearls became flowers . Many years passed before he came the last time , years during which Gwen raised her children , nursed her husband through his illness , and buried him when she was an old woman . Years during which Carrick brooded in his palace and swept through the sky on his horse . He dived into the sea to wring from its heart the last of his gifts to her . These he poured at her feet , shimmering sapphires that blazed in the grass . His constancy for her . When now , finally , he spoke of love , she could only weep bitter tears , for her life was over . She told him it was too late , that she had never needed riches or promises of glory , but only to know that he loved her , loved her enough that she could have set aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as she turned to leave him this time , as the sapphires bloomed into flowers in the grass , his hurt and his temper lashed out in the spell he cast . She would find no peace without him , nor would they see each other again until three times lovers met and , accepting each other , risking hearts , dared to choose love over all else . Three hundred years , Trevor thought later as he let himself into the house where Gwen had lived and died . A long time to wait . He 'd listened to Jude tell the tale in her quiet , storyteller 's voice , without interrupting . Not even to tell her that he knew parts of the story . Somehow he knew . He 'd dreamed them . He had n't told her that he , too , could have described Gwen , down to the sea green of her eyes and the curve of her cheek . He 'd dreamed her as well . And had , he realized , nearly married Sylvia because she 'd reminded him of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should have been right between them , he thought as he headed upstairs to shower off the day 's dirt . It still irritated him that it had n't been . In the end , it just had n't been right . She 'd known it first , and had gently let him go before he 'd admitted he already had his eye on the door . Maybe that was what bothered him most of all . He had n't had the courtesy to do the ending . Though she 'd forgiven him for it , he 'd yet to forgive himself . He caught the scent the minute he stepped into the bedroom . Delicate , female , like rose petals freshly fallen onto dewy grass . " A ghost who wears perfume , " he murmured , oddly amused . " Well , if you 're modest turn your back . " So saying , he stripped where he stood , then walked into the bath . He spent the rest of his evening alone , catching up on paperwork , scanning the faxes that had come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off replies . He treated himself to a beer and stood outside with it in the last of the dying light listening to the aching silence and watching stars pulse to life . Tim Riley , whoever the hell he was , looked to be right . There was no rain coming yet . The foundation he was building would set clean . As he turned to go back in , a streak of movement overhead caught his eye . A blur of white and silver across the darkening sky . But when he looked back for it , narrowing his eyes to scan , he saw nothing but stars and the rise of the quarter moon . A falling star , he decided . A ghost was one thing , but a flying horse ridden by the prince of the faeries was another entirely . But he thought he heard the cheerful lilt of pipes and flutes dance across the silence as he shut the door of the cottage for the night .                  @ @ @
