An unpredictable season leaves our baseball expert humbled , but-heaven help him-he still wants to take a swing at the second half Photograph // Man , what were you thinking ? " I get that one a lot , mostly from e-mailers . But this time , I 'm hearing it from the ballwriting gods , who are not to be confused with the baseball gods-a related set of deities often cited by players , coaches and managers to explain the inexplicable world of their sport . The ballwriting gods advise card-carrying members of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America to : 1 . Refrain from making predictions . 2 . Trust their instincts when unreasonable superiors demand that they make predictions . 3 . Expect to look foolish the moment their predictions appear . That 's baseball , as the crusty lifers like to say . But in this , the 2005 season , up is down , day is night , Brian Roberts is Joe Morgan and the White Sox-who last won the World Series in 1917-are on pace to win an outrageous 107 games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see all this coming , but the ballwriting gods do n't want to hear it . They 've summoned me to Mount Typefast for a private chat , claiming that I 've brought fresh dishonor to my profession , which never was exactly about curing world hunger to begin with . " The Yankees ? " Here we go . The gods are asking about the team that I picked to win the World Series . " Did you even examine their roster before picking them ? Or did you simply think that a bunch of washed-up players and former National League pitchers would roll through the American League because Steinbrenner pays them so much money ? " Photograph The Big Unit was a big mystery for most of the first half . Photograph // Well , that was part of it . But I thought Randy Johnson would be Randy Johnson . I thought the defense would be below average but not Bad News Bears . And I actually thought Carl Pavano and Jaret Wright would make smooth transitions to the A.L . The gods howl with glee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet you , Mr. TSN expert , ignored this eternal verity ! Where were the White Sox in your preseason power poll ? " Uh , 17th . " Where were the Nationals ? " Um , 23rd . " Which club did you pick to win the N.L. West ? " Ah , the Giants . My face is red . The gods are falling down laughing , prompting a mild seismic eruption in the area surrounding Mount Typefast . Now I 'm ticked . Injuries ... the gods , the e-mailers and everyone in between never take " em into consideration . How the heck can any mortal know which players are going to get hurt ? The Giants are old , so their problems are not totally surprising . But those who thought the Dodgers would turn into the Las Vegas 51s , raise your hands . No one can predict this stuff . The Cubs ' Derrek Lee ? OK , he always had this in him . The Orioles ' Brian Roberts ? True , he hit 50 doubles last season , most by a switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anyone think either was headed for big-time stardom ? How about the Astros ' Morgan Ensberg , who ranks third in the N.L. in on-base plus slugging percentage ? Or the White Sox 's Jon Garland , who already has eclipsed his career-high with 13 wins ? Or the Nats ' Chad Cordero , who leads the majors with 31 saves ? It 's a new era , all right-the post-steroid , pitching-and-defense era , as exemplified by the White Sox and Nationals . Reports of the game 's offensive demise are premature , but some of those physiques are slimmer , almost comically so . Evaluating players-and teams-never has been more difficult . And now , as play resumes , further mysteries await , not that the gods will cut me a break . " Hey , Mr. Expert , let 's hear some more predictions , just for entertainment 's sake . Here 's a good one , Mr. Expert : The White Sox will win A.L . Central . Here 's another : The Cardinals will take N.L. Central . One more : The Angels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think you can handle it ? " Well , yes , but that 's about as far as I 'll go . The gods demand humility . I 'll give " em humility . I 'll go out on a limb-er , a 6-inch twig-and proclaim to all who will listen : The other three divisions and wild cards will be decided by which teams stay healthiest and which make the best trades . Take it to the bank ! " Very funny , expert . And rather gutless . Express your opinion , or give your job to someone with a spine . " It 's like the players always say : Tough league . OK , I like the Red Sox to win the A.L . East , provided they sort out their late-inning relief . I see the Braves again seizing control of the N.L. East once they get healthy . As for the pathetic , injury-ravaged N.L. West , the Padres should win it , should n't they ? Of course , all of that looks good on paper , just as all of my preseason predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the shredder . " Tell us about the Yankees , Mr. , Expert . Will they come back ? " Heck , no , too many holes . " Who 's the A.L . wild card ? " The resurgent Indians because I 'm not sure the Twins will ever get it right . " What about in the N.L. ? " The Nationals " Jim Bowden is sitting on money for the first time in his career as a general manager , and that makes him dangerous . The Marlins will do something big , perhaps trade righthander A.J. Burnett , but there 's something missing with that team . And look out for the Astros , who could follow the same path to the postseason they did last season if they acquire the Reds ' Adam Dunn to be this year 's Carlos Beltran . " Pick one , expert ! " Photograph Dunn // The Nationals , just to keep alive the delicious possibility that the MLB-owned team will win the World Series . The Cardinals remain the overwhelming favorite in the N.L. , but just imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents the trophy with his left hand and receives it with his right . The Nationals appear downright charmed : They entered the break 16 games over .500 yet had been outscored by their opponents by four runs . They ranked last in the majors in runs scored . The White Sox were more balanced-they ranked first in the A.L . in pitching , seventh in runs scored . They seem well-built for postseason success , given the depth of their pitching and the versatility of their offense . But one scout has been telling me all season that the Angels and Red Sox are the two best teams in the American League . The gods yawn . " Do n't you get it , expert ? You do n't know what is going to happen . No one knows what is going to happen . They 're going to play 162 games . Then they 're going to play the postseason . And the entire saga will unfold , surprising us , delighting us , maybe even leaving us amazed . " Photograph Guerrero will take the Angels where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help myself . The Angels will ride Vladimir Guerrero to the World Series . The Cardinals will ride Albert Pujols , Busch Stadium will go out with a bang , but the Angels-excuse me , the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim-will prevail in seven games , then hold their parade in downtown L.A. , with owner Arte Moreno labeling the city " occupied territory . " Enjoy the rest of the season . And be sure to check back when I 'm summoned to Mount Typefast for another tongue-lashing before the playoffs . <p>
