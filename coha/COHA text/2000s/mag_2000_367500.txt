He left his wife of almost 10 years and his two sons to take up with an American woman .

He recounts his dental misadventures , for example , with masochistic self- mockery . But about the sufferings of others he manifests a tenderness that may surprise his faithful readers . The portrait of his father , in his happy prime and then in sad decline , is fascinating and moving . " When he made you laugh , " Amis writes , " he sometimes made you laugh  --  not continuously , but punctually  --  for the rest of your life .
