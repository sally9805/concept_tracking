Living in Paris while husband Tom Hanks filmed The Da Vinci Code , Rita Wilson decided to immerse herself in the ways of French style . Her verdict ? It 's tr jolie // Paris . An entire summer . I could n't wait . I would live life as a local . I would go to the markets for fresh cheese , sip cafs au lait in the Marais , Rollerblade around the Rue de Rivoli on Thursday nights . Within a few days I would be unmistakably French . But what would I wear ? Would my style translate ? Would I ever look as cool as Jane Birkin ? Oh , wait-she 's English . But she does have an Herms bag named after her . What is French style anyway ? I thought I was going to see berets , striped tees , sleek capri pants , ballet slippers , and scarves tied more ways than a first date 's tongue . Instead , I saw prairie skirts , tank tops , flip-flops , tousled ponytails , and bronze skin . And this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did n't I just see Cameron Diaz wearing that exact prairie skirt in Us Weekly , or was that Hello ! ? Or OKP . ( I just like typing magazine titles with exclamation points ! ) I did n't want prairie skirts and Birkenstocks ; I wanted pencil skirts and pumps . But where were they ? I had to investigate further . In an attempt to assimilate I spent the first few weeks putting my hair in a French twist-and having it fall down the second I walked away from the mirror . I also practiced keeping my mouth in that perpetual " ooh " position in case I needed to exclaim " Ooh l l ! " over perfect croissants . ( The " ooh " mouth also works for looking bored . It 's an all-around useful mouth position . ) As I discovered , French women can look so chic wearing the least amount of stuff . Even when they 're dressed , they look stripped . So 1 removed my bracelets , necklaces , dangling earrings , studded belt , and oversize purse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what most French women are in Saint-Tropez , and which I will never be in public . But what better way to aid in my quest for chic than going to the haute-couture shows ? Then , perhaps , I could " steal " some l-'rench style . One problem , though : The shows were happening in the midst of a horrible heat wave . All decisions about style wen tout the fentre with the heat . Being cool physically trumped being cool clothingwise . So off to Dior I went . I wore a vintage ( code for a few seasons old ) Prada sleeveless shift to keep cool . As if anyone was checking me out . I was surrounded by Oscar-winning actresses and rock stars who looked perfect . 1 watched two massive black horses harnessed to a sinister black carriage carry Erin O'Connor around a tent in the Bois du Boulogne . 1 kept imagining that they would somehow untether themselves and come straight for me , indiscriminately trampling models and celebrities on their way to freedom and fresh air . The headline would read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legs . " Horses aside , I was still riveted by the models ' Eiffel Toweresque high heels sinking into a gravel runway that looked like crushed black diamonds . I thought , Maybe it 's more heels that I need in my life as a pseudo-franaise . Step two of my French lessons : Chanel . ( Question : How did Karl Lagerfeld , in his high-collared , perfectly pressed white shirt , black suit , and gloves , not faint from the heat ? There was no fan in his hand , people ! ) All I could think about was taking a shower . And should I be in those knee-high black leather boots from die fall collection ? Is that French style ? Would that work in car pool ? At Armani Priv , guests were offered coffee . Even though I was dripping with sweat , I needed the caffeine . The pursuit of French style was exhausting . I was awakened , however , by Mr. Armani 's glamorous collection , which conjured up images of women in piano bars , late nights , smoky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet hats . That seemed French . God bless you , Mr. Valentine , for showing at night . It was slightly cooler in the p.m. , so I was able to wear an Alexander McQueen LBS ( little black suit ) . Charlize Theron had worn an LBS to Dior , and I was inspired to slavishly copy her . Valentino is Italian . He dressed Jackie Kennedy . The French loved her . I felt I was getting closer to defining French style . Was it because of his bows ? His beads ? His lace ? I felt jolie , oh-so jolie . Jean Paul Gaultier 's show , though , had a Russian theme . Having recently devoured Anna Karenina , I wanted to wear one of his gowns while astride one of those big black Dior horses galloping freely through the Murmansk forest . Or at least go to Starbucks in one . I was struggling to figure out where I could wear the clothes , however . I live in a desert . I could take home the idea of embroidery , perhaps . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she wanted to shop . A welcome diversion , it was like recess at the School of Looking French . We went to Lanvin . They were having a sale . Yes , a sale . So , I bought . I do love a little bling on clothes myself , so those wonderful adornments of pearls , stones , ribbons , and gold are perfect for looking feminine without going over-thetop . My favorite piece is a black silk beaded belt that can also be worn as a choker . Speaking of choking , how do those French women eat all that cheese and chocolate and still stay thin ? ( Yes , I know someone wrote a whole book about it , but still . ) I saw fat women in France . Oh , they exist , my friends . They just look thinner than everyone else . But when you see svelte Parisian women eating all that fat , do n't you just want to take those chic little scarves around their necks and strangle them ? And that reminds me : Accessories do sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I pulled out my trusty Balenciaga Lariat bag and Chlo sunglasses , that would help me in the French ways . But let 's talk about the real addiction : Who can pass up Christian Louboutin 's shoes ? I defy you to find me a French woman who could say no to Christian fondling her feet . For some reason that makes me think of my friend Tom Ford . I asked him what he thought French style was . " It 's not about what the French woman is wearing , " he said , gazing deeply into my eyes ( oh , all right , that 's a lie , but a woman can dream ) . " It 's in how she stands or tosses her hair or ties her scarf . You can see the years of women wearing Louis heels in her attitude . The 19th century is carried within her . French women strike poses . It 's more about the pose than the clothes . " Note to self : Practice posing . ( What happened next I would like to forgetthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high heels , a velvet beret , my new spangly blouse , with a belt tied around my neck , standing in front of the mirror . .. posing . I was also not wearing pants . What happens in Paris stays in Paris . ) After a long week of heat and haute , it was a relief to get back to my normal Parisian routine . I was so happy to be a " local " again , to go to the neighborhood art store looking for the perfect watercolor brush , to visit the local boulangerie for baguettes , to don my Converse sneakers and walk along the cobblestone street to our flat . I still had n't witnessed that mythical essence of French style , and I was cool with that . Finally , cool . But then , there she was , shopping for flowers . She had a perfectly lithe body , a pout worthy of Bardot , and she was wearing-mais oui-a pencil skirt and pumps . On cobblestones . ( Have you ever tried walking in heels on cobblestones ? Try it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) She may have been from Beirut for all I know , but at that moment she was the epitome of French chic . And I , with my prairie skirt and ponytail , was at the end of the day a hopeless American .
