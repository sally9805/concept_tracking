Geh up , Un-kel Myles , Geh up ! " Some people are awakened by the first rays of the sun gently kissing their foreheads to signal the dawning of a new day . Others are awakened by the soft coos of a lover nuzzling them on the nape of their neck . Still others have their noses tickled with aromatic scents cooked by a lover whose world was rocked the previous night . But they are all fools , Myles thought , for they do not know true morning joy unless they are stirred out of their slumber by the fingers of a pair of three-year-olds , digging into their eyes and telling them , quite loudly , to " geh up ! " They were not exactly the female companionship he had in mind , but there were worse sights to behold first thing in the morning than his twin nieces , Deja and Jade . Their hair was braided and beaded , and they were looking cute in their bright ( a little too bright first thing in the morning ) yellow matching jumpers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix-up game . " " Good morning , Jade , " he said to Deja . " Nnnnoooo , " they replied in gleeful unison . " I'm(she 's ... ) ... Jade/Deja ... she's(I 'm ... ) Deja/Jade . " " Ooohhh , " he replied , " now I understand . Hello , Deja , " he said to Jade . " Nnnnooo , " they answered . As the twins squealed with laughter , accompanied by his bulldog Winston 's yelps of bewilderment , Myles 's brother decided that he 'd had enough of this foolishness . " Myles , I know Deja and Jade are probably the firstfemales that you have had in your bedroom in months , but could you get a move on , please ? I 'm ready to play some basketball , and I 'm feeling kinda right today . " His brother , Amir , always ready with the snide comment . " Girls , go in the living room so Uncle Myles can get ready . Winston wants to play with you . " The dog glared at him as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he headed off to the living room with the little girls hot on his trail . Myles went to the bathroom to brush his teeth . As he looked up from rinsing his mouth out , he saw Amir 's reflection in the mirror . His brother was looking over his shoulder , admiring himself while pretending not to . Amir was the type of man that sisters swooned over . He was a regal , tall , muscular man with smooth chocolate skin , thick eyelashes , and a curly crop of " good hair . " Further adding to his ego was that his eyes were a shade or two lighter than the average brother 's and would sparkle when hit by light . Being the younger brother by two years , Myles had considered him the bane of his very existence when they were children . Amir was personable , a natural athlete , while Myles was the pudgy , contemplative , intellectual child . One guess as to which one was the star in their neighborhood . Even aunts , uncles , and grandparents , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " poppin ' fresh dough , " focused the majority of their praise and attention on Amir . " You know , " Amir said , taking a break from looking at himself , " I do n't understand this monk lifestyle of yours . You 're not a bad-looking guy . " " But , I 'm no you , ' right ? " " Hey , do n't set the bar so high . If you try to reach that ideal , of course you 're doomed to fail . " Even Myles had to laugh . " As I was saying , you 're a good-looking guy . You seem to have got that weight situation under control , you 're smart , available , professional ... what 's the problem ? " " Just because I have n't turned my apartment into a sanctum of skankdom does not mean there is a problem , Amir . Lord knows , before you got married you had enough women for the both of us , Mr. **41;544;TOOLONG . " " Hey , hoes can be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Myles said as he brushed past him to go back to the bedroom . He peeked into the living room and saw that the girls were engrossed with some cartoon on the TV , much to Winston 's relief . " But if I try for something more than empty one-night stands , should I be faulted for holding myself to a higher standard than skank-'em and thank-'em ' ? " As Myles put on a pair of sweats and laced up his sneakers , Amir answered in an affected , hat-in-his-hands , southern drawl , " I reckon us common Negroes ca n't wait for true , undying love because we just like the feeling of a pair of titties in our back at night . " " As do I , " he replied , ignoring Amir 's sarcasm . Myles opted for a T-shirt rather than the tank top he had on because that showed the top of his surgical scar from childhood heart surgery . Another source of insecurity was that he had been born with a heart murmur . " But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . " He regretted saying that as soon as he said it . Had he forgotten who he was talking to ? Amir gave him a look of incredulity and cracked up . " You ai n't had enough pussy in your life to say what you tired of . You have zero credibility about what you 're tired of until you staaaa-rrrrrt fuckin ' . " Myles glanced into the living room . " Damn , you 're ignorant . Do n't say anything when one of your daughters comes in here to ask you what fucking ' means . " " True that , which would be funny because this is the last place they would actually see anybody doing any . " " All right , all right , your point is made . You ready to go ? " " I 'm waiting on you , remember ? " The ride to the basketball courts took about ten minutes . After they strapped the twins into the back of Amir 's Pathfinder , Myles turned on WPRS . They were playing " It Only Takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and Amir 's favorite songs when they were kids . They alternated lead vocal duties and still remembered the words after all these years . When they stopped at a red light next to a car driven by a pretty woman , Amir could not resist the opportunity . He pulled up alongside her car on the left . He then tapped the horn lightly while at the same time rolling down the passenger's-side window from the master control panel . The horn tap got the woman 's attention . She looked directly at Myles , giving him a " what the hell do you want ? " look . Now , having been the victim of this before , Myles knew there were a couple of ways he could play it . One way was to duck your head down , act like you dropped some change on the floor . It sounded good in theory , but then Amir would yell something along the lines of : " You reach across my car , honk my horn , bothering this attractive young lady and now you gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The better option , Myles had learned , was to feign indifference when Amir tapped the horn and rolled down the window . The key was to look straight ahead and hold it . This worked best because Amir ended up looking like the fool . Myles looked like the indifferent , intriguing dude who could care less . But with this particular Latina in question , he got caught looking , and Amir moved in for the kill . " Excuse me chula , mi hermano has not been out with a mujer in muchos aos . He has no cojones . Por favor , help him . " The woman and Amir were still laughing at Myles as the Gods of Mercy changed the light to green and they took off . " Amir , " Myles said , pissed for letting himself get embarrassed , " must you always be the jackass ? " Amir put his hand on Myles 's shoulder , looked him straight in the eye , and said , " Yes , I must . " He then started to laugh again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself up , Amir . " Myles turned around to face the twins . " Deja and Jade , your daddy is a funny guy . Can you say simpleton ' ? " " Thimbleton . " " Shimpledon . " " Look at you trying to turn my daughters against me . Talk about ungrateful . This is the thanks I get for trying to help you out ? " Myles looked out the window . That woman in the car had had a pretty smile and catching laugh , even if it was at his expense . It would be nice to have a woman like that laughing because of him and not at him . He leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes . Myles pictured then window shopping down some quaint little street , strolling arm in arm . She would toss her head coyly and say cute things like " Oh , Myles , you 're something else . " Since it would be cold outside , a picturesque winter day , she would be bundled up from head to toe , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they continued their stroll they would reach a jewelry store , where she would slow down to give him the not so subtle hint that she wanted him for a long-term commitment . Because he was too good a thing to let go of . Subconsciously , as she looked at the rings , she would be squeezing his arm tighter , hoping that he felt the same way about her . The smile that spread across Myles 's face quickly turned to agitation as he felt a sharp elbow in his side . He opened his eyes and glared at his brother . " There will be no daydreaming on my shift . You should 've said something to her when you had your chance . " Chapter Two Marisa looked through the huge glass window of the restaurant . She had asked for a table in the front because she was dining alone , and figured that she could occupy herself by looking at the passersby . It was nearing noon , and the tony Georgetown street was starting to bustle with activity . Nannies pushing strollers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied for sidewalk space with the influx of businesspeople and government workers looking for a place to eat . She was admiring the cute summer outfits of two young Latinas who walked by when she saw a shiny black Jaguar approach and then stop in front of them , beeping its horn to get their attention . The passenger's-side door opened , and a girl just as pretty as the other two stepped out and walked around to the driver 's side to engage in some serious lip lock with the driver . As she leaned in as far as she could , her short skirt rode up . She was dangerously close to showing her ass to the world , a problem which she was apparently oblivious to because she took her sweet time before she finished . She finally pulled her head out of the car , blew the driver one last kiss , and giddily bounced up on the sidewalk to join her friends . The Jaguar pulled away down the block and toward the restaurant where Marisa was sitting . It stopped in front , where Marisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car , so she waved at the Jaguar 's tinted window . It was a simple , quick " yes , I do see your sorry ass " wave , which could not have possibly been interpreted as " why do n't you come inside and join me ? " Nevertheless , ten minutes later , while she was enjoying her spicy chicken wings , Ruben walked in and sat down next to her . He leaned over and gave her a kiss on the cheek , smelling and looking as good as he always did . He glanced at her plate . " That looks good . " " It is , but you ca n't have any . " " Any what ? " he said softly , leaning toward her . Someone once must have told him that it was sexy when he whispered . " Any of that , either , " Marisa said , irritated . He took his sunglasses off , leaned back , and laughed . " That 's okay , I do n't eat chicken anyway . " " Yeah , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she meant by that remark . Before he could answer , the waitress came over and gave him a menu and refilled Marisa 's water . He put his sunglasses back on and pretended to look over the menu . Really he was studying Marisa 's face for what she meant , even though he knew it was a waste of time . In the short time that he had known her , she had never revealed anything . He ordered a slice of cheesecake and a cup of coffee and handed the waitress back the menu . " I 've never had any complaints , " he said as he stuck out his tongue in a lapping motion . Marisa recoiled in disgust . If these wings were n't so damn good , this asshole was almost enough to make her lose her appetite . " I was n't talking about your bedroom habits , Ruben . I 'm referring to your need to corrupt and devour as many women as you can . " " Damn , where did that come from ? I got out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to find a parking space ? " " Oh , and here I thought you were just circling the block waiting for your young girlfriend to turn the corner . " The waitress put Ruben 's cheesecake down in front of him . He had been hoping that Marisa had n't seen him until he pulled up alongside her car . His look of chagrin at being busted was short-lived , however , and was soon replaced by a self-satisfied expression . When Marisa saw it , she knew that he had misinterpreted her level of interest . " You jealous ? " he asked . " Actually , I am . I should have had the cheesecake , too . " " That was n't anything , Marisa . Her sorority invited me to speak at her college . To give a lecture on entrepreneurship , you know , successful minorities in the business world . " He took a forkful of cheesecake . " Oh ? And what was your lecture titled ? Pimping in the New Millennium : How to Get More Bucks for Your Bangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying Marisa 's comment far more than she thought he should have . His dumb ass was probably taking it as a backhanded compliment . He leaned back in his chair and looked at her . " Funny and pretty , that 's what I like about you , morena . Nah , seriously , my construction business has been doing well . A lot of houses have been going up . Speaking of which , how is it going selling your aunt 's place ? " " I close tomorrow . " He stopped his fork in midair , hesitated , then put the food in his mouth . " So you decided not to have those repairs done I suggested ? That 's too bad , Marisa , ' cause you could have got more for the house . " " I had them done , " Marisa said , checking her watch . " What ! " he said , too loudly . He put his fork down for good this time . " I told you I would have done them for free . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer , " Marisa said as she looked at the bill and reached for her purse . " Then why did n't you let me do it ? " Marisa closed her purse and looked at Ruben , sitting there with a stupefied look on his face , and decided that there was nothing wrong with him other than his ego being bruised . He was handsome and rich and simply not accustomed to women not going along with his program . They had been introduced a while back by a mutual friend , but Marisa would n't allow herself to take him seriously and she knew she had done the right thing . Hell , he had been pursuing her for a couple of months now and had no shame about getting caught tonguing some co-ed in front of her . He was the last man that she wanted to have thinking that she owed him something . Besides , she had asked around , and Ruben 's company had a reputation for doing shitty work . " It was n't meant as a slight , Ruben . How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even ? " she said , getting up , and putting the strap of her purse on her shoulder . " Heyhey now , where you going ? " he asked , tugging at her sleeve . " I have to get back to the office , " she said , adjusting her purse so that she could free her arm diplomatically . He wrapped his arms around her waist . " Let 's do something this weekend . " This was the second time that he had put his hands on her to prevent her from leaving . " Look , Ruben , " she said , taking his hands into hers to get them from around her . " We just do n't have a lot in common , and we are n't what each other wants right now . " She gave his hands back to him . " What do you want ? What do you want that I ca n't give you ? " he asked , trying his damnedest to look earnest . She wanted to laugh at him , but hell , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an equally dramatic look on her face . " Devotion . Unconditional , till-hell-freezes-over devotion . " Ruben sucked his teeth and turned back to the table . The waitress came over , and Marisa gave her the money for the bill and tip . She then said good-bye to Ruben and headed for the door . " Unconditional devotion , huh ? Hell , Marisa , I think what you need is a dog , " Ruben called out . " Well , if I do decide to get one , I know where to go , Mr. " She then imitated the lapping-tongue motion he had done earlier , opened the door , and left . As she stepped out onto the sidewalk and headed for her car , she heard a tapping sound . She turned around and saw Ruben holding his fist near his ear , thumb and pinkie extended , miming that he would call her . She could tell he was turned on by her sticking out her tongue . She already knew that Ruben had her pegged as a freak who just needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her car . As she opened the door and got in , she looked back at the restaurant . Ruben was still leering at her . She shut the door , turned the ignition , and began to pull away . " You may be right , Ruben , but it wo n't be your worthless dick . "
