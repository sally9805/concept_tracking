" ) , and worrying a big knot in your stomach ( " I like him so much , hut can I really live with his taste in music ? " ) .

Why is n't he calling , dammit ? During that agonizing seven-day dead zone when he 's not dialingyou , it 's easy to make excuses like " Maybe lie lost my number " or " He 's probably just really busy . " But do n't waste your time overanalyzing his motives or hoping he 'll come to his senses and call .. . eventually . Men know the game better than yon think . Even if his dog dies or he 's swamped at work , seven days is more than enongh time ; for him to find five minutes to call . " When a guy lots a week pass before he contacts you , it 's his way of forcing casualness in the relationship , " says Judith Sherven , PhD , clinical psychologistin Windham , New York . " It 's an unspoken signal that he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is off or he just did n't click with you . " The bottom line is , if he 's in it for real , he 'll wait two , three days tops to contact ' you again to ensure no one else swoops in to take yon off the market ( it 's the Darwinian Code of Dating ) . If he 's already leaving yon hanging , take it as an early warning and mentally cut the connection . 2 LOVE LAW 2 By Date Three , You may Mentally Reject Him A bizarre thing happens once you sense a guy has relationship potential . One minute , you 're fawning over how spectacular he is , and then the next , you 're focusing on all of his little flaws . Says Cindy* , 27 : " I started noticing that Bill would wear the same pants for three days and thought , Oh God , I have to tell him how to dress . I 'm slowly going to start morphing into his mother . " But getting nitpicky is a sign you 're considering him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires like you would a car because it 's a huge investment , " says James Sniechowski , PhD , coauthor of be Loved for Who You Really Are . Because you know he 's such a catch , you 're not letting the little dents and cracks in his personality go unprodded-after all , you may be talcing them on long-term . So do n't reflexively run the other way . Chances are , your fears arc rooted in your own insecurities . " I realized his pants were n't the problem , " says Cindy . " My new role as " girlfriend " scared the hell out of me when I realized we were n't just dating anymore .. . we were in a bona fide relationship that could go somewhere . " 3 LOVE LAW 3 Your Single Friends Do n't Entirely Mean It When They Say They 're Happy for You Sure , your friends nod , smile , and giggle as you gush about your romantic dates and ramble on about what a great guy he is , but a few weeks into your love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fault . " Sharing too much information about anything , even if it 's good news , maybe annoying . You also have to realize that , whether they 're looking for love , going through a bad breakup , or dating with no luck , your friends ' reactions may be tied to what 's happening in their lives , not yours , " says Jan Yager , PhD , author of When Friendship Hurts . So save Ae gooey , lovey details for your married sister or engaged pal . 4 LOVE LAW 4 No Man Wants to Turn Into Your Best Friend There 's a difference between being a boyfriend and a best pal . Guys do n't really want to hear play-by-plays of your average workday or discuss details of a girl light ( " So she said X , and then I said Y , and she said .... " ) Zzzzz " Men become overwhelmed and confused by the constant outflow of communication , " says Michael Gurian , author of What Could he Be Thinking ? How a Man 's Mind Really Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel overloaded when we 're put in that position . " So do n't be pissed if he gets that glazed " I 'd rather be watching Junkjard Wars " look on his face when you 're itching to talk girlie stuff . Remember , when he 's privy to eveiy bit of minutiae in your life , it erases the exciting sense of mystery about you , emasculates him , and drains some of the sexual energy . " Being a best friend means knowing too many details , " says Todd , 26 . " I 'd love to imagine ripping off my girlfriend 's clothes during dinner , but that 's hard if I 'm hearing a laundry list of her day . " 5 LOVE LAW 5 He 's Gon na Have a Fall-From-Grace Moment-Deal With It A few months into every relationship , there 's a turning point when you realize he 's not exactly the perfect Zeus you 've made him out to be . " I found out my boyfriend had been married for six months a long time ago , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 28 . " He said it was a huge mistake , but I could n't help feeling a little let down . " Or maybe he mentions he did n't graduate from high school but got his GED . Whatever the issue , it shatters the notion that he 's The Greatest Guy Ever . But get over it . " The problem is n't his fall from grace , it 's that you 're making a huge deal out of something from his past that is n't really an issue anymore , " says Kate Wachs , PhD , a clinical psychologist in Chicago and author of Relationships for Dummies . So before you spaz , ask yourself , Okay , this is n't great , but is he still the same person ? " I realized I fell in love with my guy because he 's sweet , hilarious , and talented , not because I assumed he 'd never been married , " says Lucy . 6 LOVE LAW 6 You 're Allowed to Have One Boyfriend and 86 Crushes You meet a guy who has sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ass you could chisel rock with . There 's just one problem : He 's not your boyfriend . But just because you 're exclusive does n't mean you 're mentally monogamous too . " Women often buy into the romantic myth that if you love a guy , you should n't have sexual or emotional tuggings for anyone else , " says Gurian . " But it 's human nature to look and be curious , and it 's ridiculous to think that just because you have a feeling , you 're so weak that you 'll act on it . " So do n't deem your relationship lacking if you 're attracted to someone else . It just shows you have a healthy fantasy life , says Gurian. 7 LOVE LAW 7 Do n't Get Stuck Thinking There 's Only One Soul Mate for You in the Enitre Solar System When you 're in relationship limbo , it 's easy to get hung up on the idea that there 's only one guy out there for you . You convince yourself that the man you 're dating might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6-foot-2 , hot , rich , **27;1328;TOOLONG grad you envisioned falling for . Or maybe he 'll never compare with the one who got away-the perfect ex who , in hindsight , is so right for you . But by holding out for him , the elusive and idealized One , you 're holding yourself back . " Definingyour one arid only soul mate keeps you from getting serious with guys , " says Sniechowsld . " You automatically bypass men who do n't fit into that exact mold . " The problem starts when you convince yourself that he has to have certain qualities to be compatible . But if you keep an open mind in terms of who you might click with , you 'll realize that a 5-foot-9 , sweet , funny dude may not be the perfect guy , but he could be perfect for you . " Soul mates are n't hatched . They do n't pop up out of nowhere , " says Sniechowski . " They grow . You make a connection , build a relationship , and then you realize , This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAW 8 You lust Have Bad Sex to Have Brilliant Sex In the beginning , the sex is lust-driven , but once you let it all hang out around him and you know what to expect , the sex gets kinda lame . " We went from hot to not in less than a year , " says Marion , 34 . " I felt like we were already over because we did n't have sex as often or as eagerly as we did at the start . " But if you can both acknowledge that the sex could be better-without blaming each other or taking it personally-you 're setting yourselves up for more awesome sex than you had in the beginning , because you feel more comfortable experimenting with each other . Of course , some of those sexperirnents will fail . Maybe you 'll realize doggie-style is not your thing or that he does n't like having his testicles tuseed like vour last boyfriend did . The point is , you can only have truly mind-blowing sex if you test the waters , says Vera Bodansky , PhD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have that passionate sex you know you 're capable of as a couple .
