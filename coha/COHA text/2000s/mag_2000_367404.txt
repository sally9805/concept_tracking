The apparent transformation of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from ruthless master of metropolitan machtpolitik into compassionate hybrid of Hamlet , the Duke of Windsor and Graham Greene raises a fascinating question . Can a person really , and I mean fundamentally , change ? <P> It 's a pet theory of mine that women better accommodate change than men do because of the biological vicissitudes that mark their lives  --  ovulation , menstruation , pregnancy , childbirth , menopause . By contrast , the typical man , usually around adolescence , invents a persona for himself . He establishes a personal brand identity and then struggles to maintain it , with mind-numbing intransigence , amid the fluctuations of the world around him . <P> As a male , I 'm a staunch devotee of stasis . I do n't believe in epiphanies , personal growth , mid-life crises or deathbed conversions . Millions of years of Darwinian evolution have led to who I am , in addition to everything my parents did to mold me  --  the Dave Brubeck albums , the fondue , the deification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de fer lessons . And I would consider it an act of ingratitude and betrayal to become an entirely different person . So I try to deal with setbacks and crises in my life the way I always have  --  by locking myself in my room , setting small fires and blasting music into my headphones at jackhammer levels . <P> I do believe in brain damage though . Take Phineas Gage , for example . On the morning of Sept. 13 , 1848 , Gage , a construction foreman for the Rutland &; Burlington Railroad , was preparing a powder charge for blasting rock when it accidentally exploded , sending a 3-ft. 7-in. , 13-lb. iron tamping bar straight through his skull . Gage fully recovered and lived for 12 more years , but his personality changed . He became an extravagant , antisocial , foulmouthed , bad-mannered liar . And apparently he 'd been a pretty nice guy before the accident . <P> This I buy . Gage , by dint of significant trauma to his frontal lobes , did actually become a different person . But short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Psychiatry , penology and religion are all , to varying degrees , predicated on the belief that people have the capacity for fundamental change , whether through selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , rehabilitation or redemption . But we as a culture seem to have an equally vested interest in seeing that our public figures remain the same . Bill Gates represents the prerogative of wealth . Mark McGwire , physical power . Stephen Hawking , pure , disembodied genius . We need a stable iconic currency . What if Dick Clark , the poster child for immutability , suddenly began to degenerate like the portrait of Dorian Gray ? We 'd be appalled . And none of us really wants our President , Bill Clinton , to change even one iota . No one wants to see him toiling monastically on his memoirs or with a wrench in his hand , building low-income housing for Habitat for Humanity . We expect and desire him , once he 's thrown off the trammels of the presidency , to become the great Casanova ( at least the great Bubbanova ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noshing on marzipan as he steeps with a bevy of hot-tub hootchies in his Malibu compound .
