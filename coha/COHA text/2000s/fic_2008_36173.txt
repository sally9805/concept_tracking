Smog hung over the San Fernando Valley like a collapsed Boy Scout tent , filling in the spaces between the high-rise office buildings and freeway overpasses . The Pacific Ocean had n't produced a breeze in three weeks , and by two o'clock that August afternoon temperatures had long since shot past the century mark . <p> Alex Brady did n't care . <p> He picked up his pace , pounding his Nikes against the shimmering asphalt . Salty sweat dripped down his temples and into the corners of his mouth , but he kept running , filling his lungs with the sweltering , stifling air . Something about the sting in his chest made him feel good , stirred the intensity of his run . The intensity of his existence . If chasing bad guys on the streets of Los Angeles did n't kill him , he was n't going to keel over on the Pierce College running track . Whatever the weather . <p> Five miles and ten hill sprints every off-day , that was his mandate . And he never made the trip without Bo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else crazy enough to push this hard in the suffocating heat . He glanced at the German shepherd keeping pace alongside him . His dog , his partner for every on-duty call . His best friend , his only friend . " Atta boy . " The dog was n't even breathing hard . Alex slowed long enough to pat Bo 's deep brown coat . They both needed a drink . Alex 's ribs heaved as he ran to the bleachers and slowed to a stop . He grabbed one of his water bottles from the lowest row and downed half of it . Bo found his bowl a few feet away and lapped like crazy . This was a two-bottle day if ever there was one . <p> Alex slammed the bottle back down on the bench and kicked his run into gear again . His dog was a few seconds behind him , but he caught up easily . " Alright , Bo ... let 's get this . " Alex could feel the workout now , feel his legs screaming for relief the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bo 's earnest eyes seemed to say he would stay by his master whatever the pace , whatever the distance . Alex wiped the back of his hand across his forehead and squinted against the glare of the afternoon sun . Without question , Bo was the best police dog in the Los Angeles Sheriff ' s Department . Every bit as fit as Alex , and with a resumT of heroism unequalled among K9 units . <p> Another lap and Alex noticed something on the surface of the track . His running shoes were leaving an imprint . The asphalt was that hot . Good thing Bo was running on the grass . Push through it , he ordered himself . Dad would 've done this without breaking a sweat . <p> And then , like it did at least once a day , a rush of memories came over him so hard and fast he could almost feel the wind from its wake . His dad , Captain Ben Brady , New York City firefighter . His hero , his best friend . Suddenly it was all real again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand ... firm against Alex 's shoulder when he lost the big game his junior year ... running alongside Alex when he was six and learning to ride a bike ... or even before that , when he lifted Alex up into the fire truck that very first time . <p> Two more laps , Brady . You can do it . Alex clenched his teeth and pushed himself , but the memories stayed . There was his dad , hovering over his bed that September Tuesday morning , placing his hand against the side of Alex 's face . " Buddy ... time to get up . You got ta ace that math test ... we 'll talk about the other stuff when I get home . " <p> The other stuff . Alex blinked and the hillside that surrounded half the track appeared again . The other stuff was Alex 's determination to parlay his years as a fire cadet into an immediate position with the FDNY . As a teen , Alex could already see himself in the uniform , rushing into burning buildings , climbing atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His dad saw things differently . College would be better . His grades were good , his SAT scores in the top ten percent . Why battle fires in Manhattan when you could work in an office with a view of Central Park ? Alex was sure that was the message his dad was going to deliver that night . <p> Only the message never came . <p> The terrorists ... the terrorists picked that day to- <p> Alex found a reserve of energy for the last lap . " Come on , Bo . " He could feel the heat in his face and neck and arms , but he pushed ahead . Of course he had n't gone to college , and he had n't spent another day desiring a job with the FDNY . He 'd done the only thing he could do . He moved as far away from New York City as he could and threw himself into earning a sheriff ' s badge . That way he could consume himself with the one job that mattered after September 11 . Get the bad guys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang thugs , bank robbers or terrorists plotting the next big attack , Alex wanted them off the street . That desire was all that drove him , the only purpose he felt born to fulfill . Get rid of the evil . He and Bo . So that some other high school senior would n't have to sit in his Shakespearean English class and watch his dad murdered on live television . <p> He took the last ten yards at a sprint , his heart bursting from his chest , and then he dropped back to a walk . The smog did n't pass for oxygen , and he could n't catch his breath . But he 'd been here before . He knew how to work with the heat and dirty air . He pursed his lips and blew it all out , emptying his lungs , making space for his next breath . " Go on , Bo ... " He followed the dog to the water , and by the time he reached the bleachers he was breathing again . Ready for the hills . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few yards in either direction . Bo stayed by his water bowl , but his eyes moved from Alex to the hill at the other end of the stadium . " Give me a minute . " He grabbed his towel from the bleachers and buried his face in it . The hills were the best part . For a few intense minutes , he could feel what his father had felt , the way he must 've pushed himself up the stairs of the North Tower , looking for victims , seeking the wounded and trapped on one floor after another . <p> He tossed his towel on the bleachers and stretched hard to the right , lengthening his core muscles and bringing relief to his tired body . The left side was next , and when he finished he nodded to the dog . " Come on . " He jogged to the base of the hill with the German shepherd on the grass at his side . Then , without waiting , he lowered his head and dug into the hillside . The ground was steep , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed sure and steady . <p> Move it ... push harder , he ordered himself . Halfway up the hill the burning began and Alex welcomed it . Again his surroundings faded and Alex could see the stairwell , the way it must 've looked as his father climbed higher and higher . People rushing down the stairs , firefighters rushing up . He would do this as often as he could , every day when he did n't don the uniform , and he would remember everything his father stood for . Everything that drove him and gave him purpose in life . <p> Bo made it to the top of the hill ahead of him , tongue hanging from his mouth halfway to the ground . But even then the dog was ready for the downhill , ready for the next nine trips back up . Faster ... do n't let up . He wiped the back of his hand across his wet forehead and focused on the path back down . At the base of the hill he glanced at his watch . He needed to push through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run a few errands before dinner at the Michaels ' house . And he would n't miss dinner . <p> The evenings with Sergeant Clay Michaels and his wife , Jamie , were the only social invites Alex received . Most times he did n't really want to go , did n't want someone worrying about him or probing around in his personal life . But he promised himself he 'd show up every time Clay and Jamie asked . Otherwise , he 'd become a machine , an unfeeling robot whose sole purpose in life was to round up crooks and lock them away . Alex squinted at the hill and attacked it a second time . Not that he minded being a machine . He sort of liked the idea . But if he lost touch completely with people , he might forget one very important aspect of his job- <p> The pain of it . <p> A driving force for Alex was the way people were hurt by bad guys , because there was way too much mind-boggling sorrow out there . Deep life-altering sadness like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 11 , 2001 . If he lost track of the human suffering , he could just go ahead and hang up his gun , because the hurt was why he was here in the first place . So yeah , he would keep his dinner invitation tonight and anytime Clay and his wife made room for him at their table . Because being around them kept alive what was left of his heart . That and times like this , when his workout actually allowed him to think beyond the next few minutes . <p> The workout did something else , too-if only for a few hours . <p> It made him forget the girl he 'd left back in New York City , and all the reasons he 'd walked away from her . A girl whose indelible fingerprints stayed on his heart and whose contagious laughter and easy smile had a way of catching up to him , no matter how hard and fast he ran . <p> A girl named Holly Brooks . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
