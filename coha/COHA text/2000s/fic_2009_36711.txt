Discuss the regulars . They sit in a line like ugly , huddled birds , eyes wet with alcohol . They whisper into their cups and seem to be gloating about something - you will never know what . Some have jobs , children , spouses , cars , and mortgages , while others live with their parents or in transient motels and are on government assistance , a curious balance of classes particular to the parts of Hollywood devoid of klieg lights and make-believe . There are sometimes limousines at the curb out front ; other nights feature police cars and ambulances and vicious street scenarios . The bar interior resembles a sunken luxury liner of the early 1900s , mahogany and brass , black-burgundy leather coated in dust and ash . It is impossible to know how many times the ownership has changed hands . <p> The regulars are warm with one another but generally come and go alone and as far as you can tell have never been to one another 's homes . This makes you lonely and the hearts of the world seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every man for himself , which as a child made you want to lie down and " be killed . " <p> You do not take much stock in the North American definition of the word but you suppose these people are alcoholics . They like you , or anyway are used to you , and they reach out to touch you when you pass as though you are a good-luck gambling charm . You once found this repulsive and would circle the bar with your back hugging the wall rather than move through the network of fleshy red hands , but you have reconciled yourself to the attention and it has become familiar , even enjoyable for you . It now feels more like a commendation than an intrusion , recognition of your difficult job , and you nod and smile as the hands grab you around the waist , rubbing and slapping your back and belly . <p> From your post at the side bar entrance you watch them watch themselves in the mirror behind the bar . Preening , pecking , satisfied by their reflections - what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly about their lives prior to their residence here . Strange as it seems , they must have been regulars at some other Hollywood bar , but had moved on or been asked to move on , and they sought out a new retreat , settling down with the first free beer or kind word , some bartender 's impotent joke mutilated beyond recognition in its endless retelling . And the regulars turned to tell the joke once more . <p> You wonder also about their present lives but to make inquiries is purposeless - the regulars are all sensational liars . But you want to know what it is about their existence that fuels the need to inhabit not just the same building every night but the same barstool , upon which they sip the same drink . And if a bartender forgets a regular 's usual , the regular is cut down and his eyes swell with a lost suffering . Why ? It bothers you to know that the truth will never reveal itself spontaneously and you keep on your toes for clues . <p> When you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least expensive or what is called the well scotch . This was your brand when you were out in the world and you are happy to finally find a never-ending , complimentary supply . You have been at the bar for two years , drinking Claymore in great quantity , sometimes straight , oftentimes with ginger ale or cola , before the manager , Simon , asks why you do n't drink the quality liquors . " There are n't many upsides to the life , but I drink the best booze , " he says . And so each night you sample a different scotch or whiskey . There are more than forty-five different types of scotch and whiskey and you are very tired at the end of your quest but you find at long last the quality liquor Simon spoke of . As someone who spends a good deal of time surrounded by alcohol , people often ask what you drink , and now you do not shrug or cough but look up and say directly , " I drink John Jameson finest Irish whiskey . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you held a bottle of alcohol in your hands you felt a comfort in knowing that its contents would simultaneously deaden and heighten your limited view of the world but you did not care for the actual bottle , as you do now with Jameson , you did not trace your hands over the raised lettering and study the exquisite script . One night you are alone in the back bar doing just this - the bottle is in your hands and you are mooning over the curlicues at the base of the label - and the name John Jameson brings into your head the child 's tune " John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt . " You are humming this to yourself when Simon , the man responsible for your discovery of Jameson whiskey , enters the bar singing aloud this very same song . He waves to you and walks past , into the front bar , and you are staring in disbelief because there is no explaining so obscure a coincidence and you feel you have been visited by the strongest of omens . Good or bad , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and see . <p> Now a group of drunks up front have picked up the song and are singing in the single voice of a runaway giant . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
