Movie theaters have always been entertainment sanctuaries : dark rooms , comfy chairs , a cozy environment devoid of annoying commercials . Oops ! Scratch the part about the commercials . Premovie ads , which used to draw boos when one or two would pop up before the coming attractions , seem to be multiplying by the week . National Cinema Network , a company that places commercials on a third of U.S. movie screens , reports a 48% increase in prefilm-commercial sales over the past year . The ads , which run from 15 to 90 seconds , are the current darlings of the ad world , in part because they seem to sink in . A Nielsen study of preshow commercials revealed that viewer recall was an impressive 80% . " We 're seeing more of it because it works , " says Todd Siegel , senior vice president of sales and marketing for Screenvision , which places ads on some 14,000 screens in the U.S. " Advertisers are always trying to deliver a message in an uncluttered environment to an attentive audience . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for products ranging from M &M's; to the U.S. Army . The revenue stream is a plum for theater owners , who can earn as much as $4 million for five weeks of summer ads . But are they pushing the limit with moviegoers ? Even some ad people are nervous . " It 's a very delicate place to advertise , " says Alex Bogusky , creative director for Crispin Porter + Bogusky , an agency in Miami that created prefilm BMW commercials . " People have paid money to go see a film . You can do real harm . You show up as an uninvited guest . "  --  By Heather Won Tesoriero and Kate Carcaterra
