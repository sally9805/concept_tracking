Do n't back off ! " yelled World Cat Director of Marketing Pete Peterson . Too late . A wad of water hit him in the chest , drenching his World Cat whites . I 'd done it again  --  succumbed to my natural inclination to slow down when a particularly steep wave loomed ahead . Is n't that what any sane helmsman would do ? Not the group I was with  --  World Cat owners all , attending a Bahamas rendezvous organized by the now-soggy Peterson . These guys speed up in steep seas ... but they do n't pay the usual price . I was testing the new World Cat 33 Tournament Edition off Walker 's Cay , the legendary fishing resort just over 100 miles due east of Stuart , Fla . I had the boat pointed northeast into swells straight out of Africa that were being undercut by the tidal flow off the Little Bahama Bank . The result resembled the breakers at Oahu . Most men in monohulls reduce speed in such conditions for fear of replacing water with air beneath their hulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a World Cat  --  catch air ! " Water does n't compress , but air does , " enthused World Cat President Mike O'Connell during a recent tour of the World Cat factory in Tarboro , N.C. " It cushions the ride . " And when a World Cat reenters the water , its sharply-veed twin hulls offer nothing flat for seas to slam against  --  which renders the ride softer still . I remember my first demo ride in a World Cat . The driver seemed hell bent on compressing not air , but our knee joints and vertebrae as he headed into a serious head sea at full speed . Up we went , and down we came . I braced myself for the expected impact . But it was n't there . Off Walker 's , what I 'd been guilty of by slowing the 33 was causing the bow to " sneeze . " That 's what happens when air trapped between the hulls is forced out the front end of the tunnel , carrying water with it . At trolling speed , you can trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a head sea . But sneezes happen . ( I believe all boats benefit from trim tabs , but World Cat claims they 're not needed . ) World Cat owners are experts on the dynamics of their craft  --  owners like Jeff Eder of Boynton Beach , Fla. , an ex-Viking captain . " I did a lot of research before buying a boat of my own , because I needed something suitable for running the Boynton inlet , one of the roughest on the East Coast . The choice came down to two catamarans , " he told me at the rendezvous . Eder settled on a cuddy cabin World Cat 266SF ... and was soon glad that he had . On a run out the inlet with his little boy , Jake , in six-foot breaking seas , he inadvertently pulled the kill switch lanyard . " The boat went sideways to the sea and I could n't restart the engines not realizing what he had done . I thought I 'd broach , but the boat was amazingly stable . I 'd have been in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other World Cat owners at Walker 's disparaged monohulls as tantamount to bad memories . Seventy-year-old Dr. Richard Ehlers would n't even have a boat if a monohull were his only option . As it is , he and his wife , Jean , trailered their 266SF across Florida from Sarasota to join the rendezvous fleet led by Chuck Stillwell of Lentine Marine , World Cat 's dealership in Stuart , Fla . " At my age , a monohull is too hard on the body , " said " Doc " Ehlers , who has cleverly customized his 26 , including adding an observation tower . " World Cats appeal to veteran boaters who are sick of pounding , " said O'Connell , who has been at the manufacturer 's helm for a year now . " It 's a niche market , and our customers , who comprise something of a cult , are our best salesmen . They 're veteran boat owners who are sick of pounding . " Orders are brisk for the new 330TE , the largest World Cat yet . These power cats may look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York 's Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently bought a 33 to use at his Bermuda vacation residence ; and football celeb Terry Bradshaw bought one in Sarasota . The 33 incorporates the high-tech construction and components that O'Connell believes make his boats among the best built in the industry . The bottom is all glass , and Klegecel foam coring stiffens the hullsides . Penske fiber-reinforced urethane is encapsulated in the transom and at other high-stress areas . All rails are welded and through-bolted . PVC tubes protect hoses and wiring . Easily accessed polyethylene fuel tanks are firmly strapped into trays adhered with Plexus to the hull . In short , O'Connell 's pride in World Cat quality is well founded . While World Cats are designed with offshore fishing in mind , their soft ride also recommends them as excellent long-range cruisers . Anglers will appreciate the twin 35-gallon , lighted and insulated live wells and the three big fish boxes in the 33 . Molded-in toerails ; excellent rod storage in the cockpit and cabin ( which is mainly for storage , but can sleep one ) ; abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a fast-draining cockpit ( six scuppers ) are just some of the other features that make the 33 a superb platform for bluewater fishing . The boat can also stalk prey in the shallows , because it can run in only 15 inches of water ( draft is a flats boat-like eight inches with the engines up ) . The gunwale height ( mid-thigh aft and waist-high forward ) makes the 33 extremely safe . And , of course , the stability is excellent . One drawback to the 33 is common to most catamarans  --  its height off the water . Because of the tunnel , the deck is several inches above the waterline . This makes reaching the water from inside the boat impossible . So , while the 33 is ideal for fishing for most offshore species , billfishing presents a problem . A sailfish 's bill can be reached by raising the fish out of the water with the leader , but with a marlin of any size this would be difficult . Thus , when releasing billfish from a cat , you often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike the somewhat disjointed action cats have in quartering , beam or confused seas . There is less of a predictable " rhythm " to which you can become attuned than there is in a monohull . In other words , the pitch and roll of the boat is more unexpected . Another complaint is that they do n't " bank " in a turn and centrifugal force can throw passengers in the opposite direction from that in which the boat is turning . A sudden , common , sharp swerve by a helmsman to avoid something in the water while at high speed could potentially present a danger . I found these characteristics to be more pronounced in smaller World Cats than in the 33 , however . And there are " tricks " to driving cats that minimize these traits . The World Cat owners at Walkers assured me that you soon get used to how the boats behave , and unanimously proclaimed the breed 's virtues to far outweigh any vices . Over and over , I heard the same thing : " If you have a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm getting old , " said Brian Boss of Lake Worth , Fla. ( he 's 45 ) . " I was looking for a trailerable boat that could go anywhere , but I did n't want to beat myself to death and come back with a sore back . " His choice was a World Cat 266SC with 130-hp Hondas . " I 'm real happy with the ride and with the Hondas . I 've never had a problem with them , but I wish I had 200s , especially when the boat is fully loaded , " he said . Alkis Kourkoulos , a mechanical engineer , accompanied Boss . They met on the World Cat Forum Web site . Said Kourkoulos , " From an engineering standpoint , it makes perfect sense . The two hulls are like two knives that slice through the water . " Kourkoulos fishes the Middle Grounds , 100 miles northwest of Clearwater , Fla. , in a 266SC . " I give three- to four-foot seas no thought . What else is there at this length ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the answer would be the Glacier Bay 3470 , with twin cabins , head and galley and Honda 225s for $229,000 ( see " Baja or Bust , " October ) . ProSports has a 3660 Sport Cuddy with Yamaha 300 HPDIs for $188,000 . The 33 topped out at over 40 mph with Yamaha 250s . " Expect 50 with the new 300s , " said Peterson . ( I 'm skeptical . ) Yamaha or Honda 225s are the most popular engines in World Cats sold so far . Peterson said they do the same job as the 250s , except for the hole shot . Brand loyalty aside , I 've never met so many people so enthusiastic about their boats . World Cat 's " air compressors " are addictive . When the fleet of World Cats left Walker 's , it was rough . The wind was blowing the wrong way  --  from the west , and they faced over 100 miles of steep head seas . But no one seemed concerned . That kind of evidence is convincing .
