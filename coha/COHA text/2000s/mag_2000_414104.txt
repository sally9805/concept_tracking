// When I speak to others about my Principles for Ageless Living , I speak of the balance of life . Each community , generation and religion has descriptive terms for this balance ; most are familiar with the illustrative language of mind , body and spirit . So I talk to people using words that are far less important than the power and the depth these words hold . It does not matter what words or definitions we use , the idea is to engage in the practices that support each area of our life with equal respect and dedication . Our spirit , our nature and our fundamental core allow us to recognize that we are a part of a greater whole . Our mind , wisdom and insight allow us to observe and reflect on life . Our body , individuals and communities , allow us to affirm our life through physical interaction and participation . When people question me about my belief that our spirit influences our health and that our emotional health supports our body , I often use very simple illustrations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soothe the body of an ill child ? If we do not need to believe in the Spirit , why are Hospice workers called on to provide emotional comfort to the dying ? And if there is no power in prayer , why do our religious leaders spend time easing the worries of their congregations ? There are countless studies underway to verify the scientific proof between spiritual practices and health . One study from St. Luke 's Hospital in Kansas City , Missouri , published October 25 , 1999 in the Archives of Internal Medicine , concludes that intercessory prayer may improve a patient 's health . In the study , 1000 newly-admitted heart patients with serious heart conditions were assigned to two groups . One half of the group received daily prayer for four weeks from five volunteers who believed that prayer could influence the patient 's health . The study concluded that those patients in the group receiving prayers were 11 percent more likely to have improved health over those who did not receive prayer . A study presented to the American Psychological Association by Dr. Dustin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Plante of Sara Clara University suggests that recovery for addicts is higher among those who consider themselves to be highly religious or spiritual . Of the 246 addicts studied , 74 percent considered spiritual and religious practices to have aided in their recovery . A study of 128,000 people suggests that those who regularly attend religious services are 29 percent more likely to live longer than those who do n't . And there are countless studies to suggest that social ties have an extremely positive effect one the longevity of a person 's life . I believe that our spiritual practices do support a longer life . But more importantly , I believe that spiritual practices support a better life . I also think that if there was no proof that our physical , emotional and spiritual health were linked , we would still gravitate toward the practice , because in simple truth , it makes us feel better . I feel that however we choose to express our spiritual nature , the practice will sustain us in other areas of our life and will lend positively to the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a grand demonstration and at other times with quieter expression . Our entire life 's work is an arch-from beginning to end it is filled with practices that support the emotional and spiritual needs of not only our own selves , but of that of our families , friends , loved ones , and community . And , as women , we are offered the greatest of blessings , because while our intuitive nature pulls us toward these practices , our logical self does not ask for proof that these practices are needed . I encourage women to be empowered by our nurturing nature . We have the opportunity every day to create a change and make a difference . The changes may begin in our home and move out , or the outside may influence us and we may incorporate what we learn into our home environment . When we give to one person , who in turn gives to another , the path of that giving is so grand that we can not help but be influenced by its brilliance . We only question the existence of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times is so unbelievable . Photograph // So while the scientific community searches for the provability between health , longevity and spiritual practices , I suggest that we continue doing what we know  --  support our own lives and those we love with spiritual practices for living . Spiritual Practices for Living and Longevity Service to Others : We know that people require physical touch and connections to community to support their health and emotional well  --  being . The act of volunteering-of giving to another-is one way to affirm life . When we spend time with others who are in need of comfort , companionship or caring , we are creating positive influences . We are essentially placing value on life with the sacrifice of our own time and energy . Look at your schedule . If you had one hour of your week to give , with whom would you share your time ? Gratitude and Thankfulness : By practicing gratitude in our life , we are shifting the view we have of it and ultimately the direction our life will take . When we find life too difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world becomes smaller . Practicing gratitude affords us the freedom that comes from understanding that life is a process of hardships and joys . The strength you will receive by practicing gratitude will provide you the momentum you need to pass through difficult and trying times . Is there a person who gives to you that you should thank in return ? Sharing of Our Wisdom and Life 's Experience : Sharing knowledge with others reinforces the knowledge within us . Learned teachers often speak of the fact that they learn most when they are teaching and challenged with questions from their students . Teaching is also a self-test , where we access our own strengths and weaknesses . Knowledge is not knowledge until it is shared with others . Have you shared with a member of a younger generation something you know and have you listened in return ? Supporting the Efforts of Women in Our Community : Women are a catalyst for change . When we learn from one another , share with one another and provide inspiration and support to each other , we are sharing the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that nurturers require nurturing . Women should be supported in their quest toward self-realization , not only because each individual life carries merit , but also because it is through women that the lives of men and children are influenced . Can you think of a woman with whom you can develop a supporting relationship ? Can you give of your time or your effort , to make her life better ? Mindfulness and Awareness : I believe mindfulness to be a constant observation of the powerful influences in our life and the influences we have on the lives of others . Mindfulness is a navigational tool for life whereby we learn more about where we are , while giving ourselves the freedom to become more of who we should be . Can you sit with yourself for even 10 minutes a day , in meditation or yoga , to calmly experience your true emotions attached to the events in our life ? Acceptance of Our Own Beauty : Our approach to and acceptance of our own intrinsic personal beauty enables us to share our gifts . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding who we are . We can not at once be stuck in the fear that we are not good enough while at the same time committing ourselves to an honest exchange with others . Can you look in the mirror once a day and remind yourself of the beauty within and the essential contributions that you make ? Respecting the Earth and Nature : The Earth-with its animals , water systems , ecosystems and plants-supports and nourishes our physical existence . Nature 's gifts are not endless . The magnificence of Nature is worthy of our respect . By replenishing and respecting nature , by giving to its physical health and well-being , we are ensuring our own . Interestingly it is science-in search of medical or environmental solutions-that has most often demonstrated our interdependence within the world in which we live . It is my sense that these same scientific communities will continue to support the belief that every aspect of our life influences another .
