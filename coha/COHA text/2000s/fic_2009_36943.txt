Welcome to New York , sis . " Jude Allen gave his big sister Peyton Sawyer a long hug as he entered her one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn . <p> He stood and assessed his sister . Although he had n't seen her in several months , Peyton looked as beautiful as ever , fit and trim in a fuchsia track suit . Her warm cocoa-colored skin glowed and her shoulder-length black hair shone brightly . His big sister was a real looker . Jude was going to have to beat the New York fellas away with a stick . <p> " Thanks , " Peyton said , smiling warmly and pulling him inside . " Make yourself at home . That 's if you can find a place to sit . " Boxes filled up nearly every square inch . <p> " I 'm so glad you 're here , " Jude said . " Now I do n't feel so alone . I have family in town . " <p> " Not that you need me , " Peyton commented . Her baby brother was an extrovert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Jude the actor in action . He 'd already acquired a bit part on a soap opera and was hoping to snag a Broadway show . <p> " No regrets ? " he asked , pushing several boxes aside and sitting on her leather sofa . She 'd sure surprised the heck out of him and their parents when she 'd left her professorship at Cleveland State University to move to New York . <p> " None . " Peyton shook her head . " I needed to make a change , " she replied . " And what better way than to come to New York , right ? " She felt she did n't have to say what she really felt , which was that after losing her husband David Sawyer in a terrible three-car pile up five years ago , she was ready for a change of scenery . <p> " I understand . " Jude patted her knee . Cleveland held too many memories . " You can get lost here . " <p> " Exactly . " <p> " But neither Amber nor I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're here to keep you centered . " <p> Peyton smiled . Amber Martin was her dear friend from college . They 'd kept in touch over the years since finishing their PhDs and now they would be teaching at New York University together . " And I appreciate that . But I 've got my work cut out for me . Making tenure is not going to be easy . " The Dean of the College of Education fully expected her to publish several articles a year before making tenure . <p> " True , but no one is more driven than you , " Jude said . " You 'll make tenure . " Peyton had known she wanted to teach for as long as he could remember . When they were younger , she 'd follow their mom and sit in on her classes while Jude on the other hand preferred the arts . He supposed he got that from his father , who was a musician . <p> " From your lips to God 's ears , " Peyton said , laughing . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If had to put my money on anyone , I 'd put it on you every time . " <p> " We need funding , Malik . The center needs to be painted , " Theresa Harris commented . " And the computer center needs new printers . " <p> " Do n't you think I know all of this ? " Malik asked , exasperation in his voice . As director , he was aware of all facets that went into keeping the center 's medical and recreational facilities in tip-top condition . He 'd been the director of the Harlem Community Center since his mentor Andrew Webster had retired and handed the reigns over to him five years ago . Given his success at HCC , he 'd recently been given the added responsibility of overseeing several centers throughout Manhattan , but he kept HCC as his home base . <p> The promotion had increased not only his workload , but his paycheck as well . Malik was doing quite well for himself and owned a renovated brownstone in Harlem . He 'd been smart to buy many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Central Harlem . Now his brownstone was worth over a million dollars . Who would have ever thought that he , an orphan since the age of ten , would have what he had ? <p> " I have a meeting coming up with the Community Advisory Board at Children 's Aid Network . But what we really need is a corporate sponsor . In the meantime , however , we 'll have to make do . " <p> " And did I mention we need another volunteer doctor ? " Theresa added . <p> " Now that , I have a handle on , " Malik replied , shifting through the manila folders on his desk . He 'd already interviewed several doctors who 'd offered to come in one day a week to ease the load in the health clinic . " I have several candidates , and it 's just a process of picking the best one . " Malik did n't know what he 'd do without his right hand . As assistant director of the Harlem Community Center , Theresa kept Malik focused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . " <p> " And now that we have business covered , what are we going to do about your love life ? " she asked . Over six feet tall , Malik Williams was a fine-looking man . Even with long dreads and a permanent five o'clock shadow , a black Bob Marley T-shirt and some faded blue jeans , Malik exuded a raw masculinity . Theresa did n't know why he was still single . <p> " I appreciate the concern , " Malik replied , " but I'mnot interested in seeing anyone right now . My plate is full . " <p> " Do you even remember the last time you had a date ? " Theresa asked . " Because I sure ca n't . You need to find you a good woman to settle down with . I know you 'd make an excellent husband and father . I see the way you interact with those kids as their basketball coach . " <p> " Theresa , " he said with exaggerated patience , " Marriage is n't for me . " He 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lose all common sense and not realize that the man you 'd brought into the fold as father to your son was beating the crap out of him . Malik would never forget what it was like being on the receiving end of his stepfather , Joe Johnson 's belt . It was better he left marriage to all the gullible people in the world . The ones who believed that love could conquer all instead of the reality that love was blind . <p> " How would you know ? " Theresa responded . " You 've never been in a relationship long enough to find out . " <p> " I get what I need . " <p> Theresa did n't blink at Malik 's comment . " If you 're referring to sex , there 's more to a relationship . " <p> " I am . And sex is all I need . Both parties get mutual satisfaction without all the entanglements . Trust me , Theresa . I 'm better off . " Malik closed the folder . " Now if you 'll excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Malik glanced at his watch . He was already late for dinner with his best friends , Dante Moore , Sage Anderson and Quentin Davis . The foursome had grown up together at the orphanage , but despite their rocky start they 'd all gone on to have successful careers . Dante owned his own restaurant , Sage was a corporate attorney and Quentin was a world-renowned photographer . But this spring their tight family unit had been put to the test with some major drama and they 'd all vowed to never let anything come between them again . <p> Theresa had been his assistant the last five years and knew when he was brushing her off . " Tell Sage , Dante and Q , I said hello . " <p> Malik turned at the door and glanced at her . She knew him too darn well . " Sure thing , Theresa . I 'll see you tomorrow . " <p> " I ca n't believe we 're going to be working together , " Amber commented as she helped Peyton unpack her new office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at her best friend . " You just do n't know how much I needed a change . " She loaded her arms up with books and placed them on the bookshelves from the previous professor . <p> " I think I have some idea , " Amber replied . " Here , let me help you with that . " Amber took several books out of Peyton 's arms . " So , have you had the opportunity to meet some of the department faculty ? " <p> " Briefly , at a faculty brunch during the interview process in May ; but I have n't seen anyone yet . I ca n't believe it 's already August and fall semester starts in a week . " <p> Amber watched as Peyton put every book in alphabetical order according to title . Peyton hated things out of place . " I 'm sure they 'll pop by and stick their heads in . They ca n't resist getting the scoop on new blood . " Amber chuckled . " We professors are such gossips . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And make sure my skeletons stay hidden . " <p> " As if you had any . " Amber laughed derisively . " You are the most straightlaced person I know . " <p> " And you are the most radical , " Peyton replied , turning around and staring at her hippie friend . In all the years they 'd known each other , Amber had n't changed a bit , except for maybe the hair . The hair was shorter in a chic layer bob , but her style was still the same . Wearing hiphuggers , a novelty T-shirt and a pageboy cap , Amber looked like a student , instead of an accomplished professor with a PhD in women 's studies . <p> " True , and that 's why we make a great team . You are going to have so much fun in New York . Cleveland will be a distant memory . " <p> " What 's our first step ? " <p> " First we 're going to get you settled in , " Amber began , " and then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know about all that , " Peyton replied . They were n't the ladies of Sex and the City . Peyton was n't ready for an active social life . She 'd been on a few dates the last couple of years , but she 'd felt so guilty . David had been the only man she 'd ever loved . They 'd known each other since they were in kindergarten , and when she 'd matured into womanhood love had blossomed . It was hard for her not to compare every man she met to David , as if it would even be possible for them to live up to such a high standard . <p> " Do n't you trust me ? " Amber asked , giving Peyton her most innocent face . <p> Famous last words , thought Peyton . <p> Malik strolled into Dante 's tapas bar half an hour later than expected , and Sage wasted no time . <p> " You 're late , " Sage commented , looking down at her watch when Malik joined her at the wave-shaped bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend to , " Malik answered the beautiful , brown-skinned , five-foot , three-inch barracuda of a lawyer who also happened to be one of his dear friends . <p> " More important than us ? " Sage countered . <p> " Do n't answer that . " Dante pointed his finger at Malik from behind the bar . " Not if you know what 's good for you . " He returned to making several drinks for patrons . Even though he was working , Dante always managed to look casually put together in slacks and a crew neck sweater . <p> " Well , from the looks of it  --  " Malik glanced around the nearly full restaurant "  --  I am not the only one . " He did n't see Quentin or his girlfriend Avery Roberts anywhere . <p> " Quentin had the courtesy to call , " Sage replied . <p> " You mean the Quentin Davis who can do no wrong in your eyes , you mean that Quentin ? " Malik pinched Sage 's nose as he took the barstool next to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Malik used to do it all the time when they were growing up at the orphanage together . That 's when he was n't fighting off the bullies that made fun of her constant sickliness . Back then she 'd suffered from terrible allergies , not to mention her asthma , which had gone undetected due to her mother 's drug use and neglect . <p> " Greetings ! " Quentin walked in with his girlfriend Avery . Malik had to admit that if anyone had ever told him there would come a day in which a player like Quentin would be settling down with one woman , he would have called them crazy . But he could n't knock Quentin , because he had never seen him happier . <p> " Good to see you , bro . " Malik rose from the stool and patted him on the back . " Avery . " He kissed her on the cheek . " You 're looking well . " Not that Malik had ever seen Avery 's razor-cut , shoulder-length hair out of place . Fair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sophistication all rolled into one . <p> " Thank you . " Avery smiled back . <p> " So what 's on the menu tonight , Dante ? " Malik asked . He liked that they 'd all incorporated a weekly dinner into their daily lives . When Quentin had been photographing the war in Iraq , a part of their foursome was missing and dinner had n't been the same . <p> " A little of this , a little of that , " Dante replied coyly . He always liked to surprise the group with new recipes . " What can I get the two of you to drink ? " he asked Quentin and Avery . <p> " A Heineken and a glass of pinot grigio , please . " <p> " How 's the center ? " Sage inquired . <p> " Busy and fast-paced , " Malik replied . There was always paperwork to complete or a meeting to attend about funding , programming , etc . " Truth be told , the center is in dire need of a renovation . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . Since he 'd begun mentoring the center 's youth in photography , Quentin had seen the work that needed to be done . <p> " Have you brought this up to Children 's Aid Network ? " Avery inquired . Avery was very familiar with charitable organizations , since her mother was one of their biggest supporters . <p> " I plan on it , but it 's a tough position for CAN . They have to weigh which program or center needs the money the most . And HCC has to fall in line just like everyone else . " <p> " Sounds like you need a corporate sponsor , " Sage replied . <p> " That would be a dream come true . A benefactor completely focused on just the Harlem center , " Malik replied . <p> " I 'll ask around , " Avery piped in . With her parent 's social standing in the community , she was exposed to many influential people  --  but only one immediately sprang to mind . <p> Quentin noticed the grin on Avery 's face and whispered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? " <p> Avery nodded . " I do and I 'll tell you all about it later . " <p> " How 's the law firm ? " Malik asked , changing the subject . As much as he loved the center , he needed a break from worrying about its troubles . <p> " Well , I feel like I can see the end of the road , " Sage replied . " I 've been at the firm for four and a half years . I 'm hoping I can make partner in five . " <p> " Do n't kill yourself trying . " <p> " Oh please , Malik , " Sage chuckled . " You are just as bad as I am . You spend your whole life at that center . " <p> " This is true , " Quentin said , coming over with his Heineken . <p> " I 'm dedicated . " Malik defended himself . <p> " To your work , " Dante finished . <p> " And what 's wrong with that ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , " Quentin pulled Avery towards him and planted a swift kiss on her lips . <p> " Like you ? " Malik said , smiling . " Hmm , I think I 'll leave you to that love stuff . I do n't believe in love . " Malik had seen the flipside of the love coin . Everyday at the center , he saw men who beat their wives , men who left their wives , wives who abandoned their children for men . Love ? Love he could do without . <p> " You are a true cynic , my friend , " Quentin replied . He too , had been a cynic , but Avery had changed all of that for him . Now he was love 's biggest advocate . " But just you wait when that love bug hits you . Trust me , you wo n't know what to do . <br> Continues ...
