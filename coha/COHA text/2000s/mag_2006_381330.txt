When the lead singer of a critically beloved , commercially successful band in its prime releases a solo album , it 's a bit like a married man with two kids zipping by in a fiery new Porsche . Something , you suspect , ai n't right at home . Sure enough , Thom Yorke has admitted that Radiohead , years-long holder of the title Only Band That Matters , has hit a lethargic patch . Personal lives have grown comfortable , professional momentum has slowed . With the future uncertain , Yorke made The Eraser  --  which turns out not to be a betrayal of his band but a love letter to it . <P> From the ethereal melodies to the beats layered upon beats , The Eraser is full of Radiohead music  --  dark , dystopian , oddly beautiful  --  minus the other members of Radiohead .

The Clock creates some grinding tension but never figures out how to release it , while Black Swan eddies around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) that hardly mines new emotional territory . You can sense Yorke 's grasping for something , and with the help of producer Nigel Godrich , who oversaw Beck 's midcareer-crisis record , Sea Change , he eventually finds it : clarity . <P> On much of The Eraser , Yorke 's choirboy voice , usually pickled in distortion , comes through cleanly , and he conjures up some clear ideas too .

More often than not , though , Yorke speaks for , and to , himself . On Atoms for Peace , he sings , " No more going to the dark side with your flying saucer eyes ... No more talk about the old days , it 's time for something great . " The Eraser is n't  --  but by distilling Radiohead into something intimate , it may point the way toward greatness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
