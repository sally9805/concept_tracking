T he murder appeared to be a crime of passion , the killer having left a trail of evidence behind him that even a blind man might have followed . It was the identity of the victim , not the murderer , that brought Scotland Yard into the case . No one knew who she was . Or , more correctly perhaps , what name she might have used since 1916 . And what had become of the man and the two children who had been with her at the railway station ? Were they a figment of the killer 's overheated imagination ? Or were their bodies yet to be discovered ? The police in Dorset were quite happy to turn the search over to the Yard . And the Yard was very happy indeed to oblige , in the person of Inspector Ian Rutledge . It began simply enough , with the London train pulling into the station at the small Dorset town of Singleton Magna . The stop there was always brief . Half a dozen passengers got off , and another handful generally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes and sacks were offloaded with efficiency , and the train rolled out almost before the acrid smoke of its arrival had blown away . Today , late August and quite hot for the season , there was a man standing by the lowered window in the second-class car , trying to find a bit of air . His shirt clung to his back under the shabby suit , and his dark hair lay damply across his forehead . His face was worn , dejection sunk deep in the lines about his mouth and in the circles under tired eyes . He was young , but youth was gone . Leaning out , he watched the portlystationmaster helping a pale , drooping woman to the gate , the thin thread of her complaining voice just reaching him . " ... such hardship , " she was saying . What did she know about hardship ? he thought wearily . She had traveled first class , and the leather dressing case clutched in her left hand had cost more than most men earned in a month . If they were lucky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . But he 'd heard there was a builder hiring down Lyme Regis way . The train was a luxury Bert Mowbray could n't afford . Still , jobs did n't wait , and you sometimes had to make the extra effort . He refused to think what he would do if he 'd guessed wrong and there was nothing at the end of his journey but a grim shake of the head and " No work . Sorry . " His gaze idly followed a porter awkwardly trundling his cart full of luggage across the platform , followed by a pair of elderly women . The cars were already jammed with families on their way to the seaside , but room was found for two more . Then his eye was suddenly caught by another woman outside one of the cars farther down the train , kneeling to comfort a little girl who was crying . A boy much younger , not more than two , clung to the trouser leg of the man bending protectively over them , speaking to the woman and then to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight with shock and dismay . It could n't be Mary " My God ! " he breathed , " Oh , my God ! " Turning from the window , he lunged for the door , almost knocking the wide-brimmed hat from the head of a startled farmer 's wife who could n't get out of his way fast enough . He tripped over her basket , losing precious seconds as he fought for his balance . Her companion stood up , younger and stouter , and demanded to know what he thought he was doing , her red , angry face thrust into his . The train jerked under his feet , and he realized it was moving . Pulling out " No ! No wait ! " he screamed , but it was too late , the train had picked up momentum and was already out of the small station , a few houses flashing by before the town was swallowed up by distance and fields . He was nearly incoherent with frustration and the intensity of his need . He yelled for the conductor , demanding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phlegmatic man who had dealt with drunken soldiers and whoring seamen during the war years , said soothingly , " Overslept your stop , did you ? Never mind , there 's another just down the road a bit . " But he had to restrain Mowbray before they reached the next stationthe man seemed half out of his mind and was trying to fling himself off the train . Two burly coal stokers on their way to Weymouth helped the conductor wrestle him into a seat while a prim-mouthed spinster wearing a moth-eaten fox around her shoulders , never mind the heat , threatened to collapse into strong hysterics . Mowbray had gone from wild swearing and threats to helpless , angry tears by the time the train lurched into the next town . He and his shabby case were heaved off without ceremony , and he was left standing on the station platform , disoriented and distraught . Without a word to the staring stationmaster , he handed in his ticket for Lyme Regis and set off at a smart pace down the nearest road in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone when he got to the town . And no one could tell him where to find them . He went to the only hotel , a small stone edifice called , with more imagination than accuracy , the Swan , demanding to know if a family of four had come in by the noon train . He stopped at the small shops that sold food and the two tearooms nearest the station , describing the woman first , then the children and the man . He badly frightened one clerk with his furious insistence that you must have seen them ! You must ! He tracked down the carriage that served as the town taxi and angrily called the driver a liar for claiming he had n't set eyes on the woman or the man , much less the children . " They 're not here , mate , " the middle-aged driver declared shortly , jerking a thumb toward the back . " See for yourself . Nobody like that came out of the station today while I was waiting . If you was to meet them here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that you got your dates wrong . " " But they ca n't have vanished ! " Mowbray cried . " I 've got to find them . The bitch the bitch ! they 're my children , she 's my wife ! It is n't rightI tell you , if she 's tricked me , I 'll kill her , I swear I will ! Tell me where she 's got to , or I 'll throttle you as well ! " " You and who else ? " the man demanded , jaw squared and face flushed with an anger that matched Mowbray 's . All afternoon he haunted Singleton Magna , and a constable had to caution him twice about his conduct . But the fires of anger slowly burned down to a silent , white-hot determination that left him grim faced and ominously quiet . That evening he called at every house on the fringes of the town , asking about the woman . And the children . Had they come along this road ? Had anyone seen them ? Did anyone know where they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town shook its collective head and shut its collective doors in the face of this persistent , shabby stranger with frantic eyes . Mowbray spent the night under a tree near the station , waiting for the next day 's noon train . He never thought of food , and he did n't sleep . What was driving him was so fierce that nothing else mattered to him . He stayed in Singleton Magna all that day as well , walking the streets like a damned soul that had lost its way back to hell and did n't know where to turn next . People avoided him . And this time he avoided people , his eyes scanning for one figure in a rose print dress with a strand of pearls and hair the color of dark honey . By the dinner hour he had gone . Hardly anyone noticed . When a farmer discovered a woman 's body that evening , the blood from her wounds had soaked deeply into the soil at the edge of his cornfield , like some ancient harvest sacrifice . He sent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took one look at her there on the ground and ordered a warrant for the arrest of the man who had been searching for her . Although there was no identification on the body , they were fairly sure she was n't a local woman . And the way her face had been battered , there had been a hot , desperate anger behind the blows . The missing wife , then , had been found . All that was left was to see that her murderer was brought to justice . Late that same evening Mowbray was run to earth , roughly awakened from an exhausted sleep under the same tree outside the railway station . In a daze , not understanding what was happening to him or why , he allowed himself to be led off to the small jail without protest . Afterward , the inspector in charge , congratulating himself on the swift solution of this crime practically on his doorstep , boasted to the shaken farmer on the other side of his tidy desk , " It was all in a day 's work . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Ca n't stop crime altogether , but you can stop the criminals . That 's my brief . " " I thought he was the one hunting all over town for his lost family ? " " So he was . Silly bugger ! All but advertising what he was going to do when he found them . " " But where are they , then ? The husband and the children ? They are n't somewhere in my fields , are they ? I wo n't have your men tramping about in my corn , do you hear , not when it 's all but ready for the cutting ! My wife will have a stroke , she 's that upset already ! The doctor 's been and gone twice . " Inspector Hildebrand sobered . He much preferred expanding on his success to any discussion of his failure . " We do n't know where they are . Yet . I 've got my men searching now along the roadside . More than likely he 's done for the lot , but so far he 's sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's not hearing a word we say to him . But we 'll find them , never fear . And they 'll be dead as well , mark my words . Probably saved the woman for last , she got away from him , and he had to chase her . Just a matter of time , that 's all . We 'll find them in the end . " He did n't . In the end , it was Scotland Yard and Inspector Rutledge who had to sort through the tangled threads of deception and twisted allegiances . By that time it was far too late for Hildebrand to retreat from his entrenched position .
