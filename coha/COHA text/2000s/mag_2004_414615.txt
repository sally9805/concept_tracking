To understand Elvis Presley , skip kitschy Graceland in Memphis and visit Tupelo , Mississippi . The two-room cabin there where the king of rock " n ' roll was born is a world away from the glitz of his later years . Likewise , to understand Tiger Woods , bypass the grandeur of Augusta National and Pebble Beach for Orange County , California . The crowded , colorful munis there are full of clues to what makes Tiger tick .  --  Raised in Cypress , a middle-class Los Angeles suburb , Woods first teed it up as an 18-month-old at the Navy courses in nearby Los Alamitos . His father , Earl , a former Green Beret , had playing privileges there . But Tiger 's first home track was Heartwell Golf Course , a par-3 layout in Long Beach . The parking lot at Heartwell is only slightly less crowded than the driving range , where on one recent Sunday afternoon all 31 mats were taken and a dozen-plus golfers were waiting their turn . " Golfers " may be a generous description since many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hoe . " Ball " is even a stretch , as $6 buys a bucket of dimpled Cream of Wheat lumps . Yet every weekend there 's a line at the 1st tee when the lights come on at 5 a.m . Young Tiger spent many summer days at Heartwell . " He 'd practice hitting , chipping and putting all morning , take a break for lunch , then go play in the afternoon , " says former assistant pro Rudy Duran , who signed on as the 4-year-old cub 's first coach . Heartwell measures 2,143 yards with a par of 54 , but Duran had Woods play it at a " Tiger par " of 68 . Hanging on the lobby wall between the restrooms is a replica scorecard dated August 27 , 1980 , the day Woods  --  still four months shy of his fifth birthday  --  made a deuce on the 91-yard 3rd hole for his first birdie . He won that battle but not the war . The final tally reads , MOM-66 , TIGER-70 . Woods cut his golfing teeth on Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are in surprisingly decent shape considering they get almost as much traffic as the nearby Interstate 405 . I checked in before 7 a.m. on a Monday at El Dorado Park , and the guy behind the counter told me to join a foursome warming up on the 1st tee . " Make a fivesome ? " I asked . " Are you sure ? " " That 's how we do it here in Long Beach , " he said . El Dorado 's tight fairways  --  and a manageable layout of just 6,461 yards  --  render driver a liability on most holes . Wander into the tree-lined rough and hacking out is like playing Pachinko . Straight , smart irons are the key to scoring here . As I struggled to absorb this lesson , it struck me as unsurprising that so many of Tiger 's most memorable shots involved neither his driver nor his putter : the holed approach on the 15th at Pebble Beach during the 2000 AT &T,; the miraculous 3-iron in the 2002 PGA and that awe-inspiring 6-iron from the sand on the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6,405-yard incubation chamber where Woods honed his intense concentration  --  a remarkable feat since a course that hosts 124,000 rounds a year will stretch anyone 's focus . Course management is also put to the test at Rec Park . Shortly before one of his first matches for the Western High School Pioneers , Woods was advised by coach Don Crosby not to hit the big stick at the 295-yard 1st hole , a downhill par 4 . " He hit driver pin high but left , off the cart path and across the street , " says Crosby . " I asked him why he hit driver , and Tiger said because he 'd hit it safely the last time he 'd played the course . So I ask him when was the last time he played there , and he shrugged and said , About six years ago . ' ' " When Woods was 10 years old , Earl introduced him to Meadowlark Golf Club in Huntington Beach and pro John Anselmo , who coached Tiger until he flew the coop for Stanford . Asked what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anselmo says , " Tiger was 139 pounds when he went off to college . " Meadowlark 's opening hole is dominated by a massive tree that fronts the green . " What kind of tree is that ? " I asked Al and Dean , two friendly old regulars with whom I was paired . " I du n no , " said Al , " but I wish it would die . " The course is just 5,609 yards , but it 's fun  --  except for the overgrown rough and a few crowned greens that make it feel like you 're hitting your ball onto a balloon . At the 370-yard 12th hole , I hit an easy wedge that landed on the green and rolled off the back , never to be seen again . Charlie Brown 's kite-eating tree has nothing on this rough . Woods 's most tigerish trait is his love of the kill . He not only wants to beat you today , he wants you beaten before you even show up next week . That was also the case back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golf Course in Anaheim . Dad Miller is the future home of the Tiger Woods Learning Center ( twlc.org ) , which is scheduled to open next summer . The facility will include a 35,000-square-foot education complex and a 23-acre teaching area designed by Tom Fazio . But Woods first stamped his name here long ago . Before his final tournament as a high school senior , Tiger 's teammates talked him into swapping his trusty Titleist ball for a denser Top-Flite on the 326-yard 1st hole . He promptly drove the green . Pitted against Tiger 's prodigious length , his pimpled prey must have been utterly demoralized on the short 4th and 5th holes  --  par 4s measuring just 259 and 300 yards , respectively . " The 17th hole is a par 5 , over 600 yards , " says Anselmo . " Tiger once reached the green hitting driver , 2-iron . " The president of the chess club had a better chance with the prom queen than the best golfer from a rival school did against Tiger . For all of the trophies and attendant glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . Long gone are the days when he could stroll unnoticed onto a Long Beach muni and relive his childhood . Tiger can go home again no more than Elvis could have shed the sunglasses and kicked back in Tupelo . And in a way , that 's too bad , because behind the fame and fortune is a kid who once played a game with which we are all familiar .
