<p> Each year at this time , the challenge for many teachers is not trying to cover the fall of Rome before the end of the month . Instead , they 're focused on minimizing calls from parents upset by how holiday celebrations play out in their child 's classroom . The conundrums are endless : Can I have a tree ? How about Santas ? If we sing the dreidl song , can we slip in " The First Noel " ? What about Kwanzaa , Ramadan , and Chinese New Year ? It can seem as if all teacher training should include a review of key legal decisions on the First Amendment . The intersection of schools and religion has been territory for both acrimony and hope . Complaints from parents that a school is promoting - or belittling - religious belief have n't disappeared . But some observers see greater willingness to embrace the holidays as " teachable moments " that educate children about the diversity of faith and tradition coursing about them . The Learning section this week offers several scholars ' and chaplains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K-12 classrooms but on college campuses as well . Campus chaplains also weigh in on students ' interests at a time of year that often stirs questions about religious faith . Despite recent progress toward treating holidays thoughtfully , many public schools still struggle with rancor in the season of " peace on earth . " Often the battles are over seemingly minor points - but to many , they are symbolic of much deeper issues . " Outsiders wonder why this is a big deal , " says Charles Haynes , senior scholar at the First Amendment Center in Arlington , Va . " It 's not about the tree - it 's about ' Whose schools are these ? ' and ' Whose nation is this ? ' It triggers deep emotions because public schools have been a place where we define ourselves as a people . " He says many schools are still confused about what to do in December . Some pursue quick-fix solutions - leaving religious music out of the winter concert altogether , or blithely mixing trees and menorahs in school halls . Such efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituencies end up feeling their traditions are only superficially acknowledged . " We have a problem with taking religion seriously , " Mr. Haynes says . " We know it 's constitutional and kids should learn something to be educated . But helping kids see and understand how religions view the world - that we still do n't do much of . " A positive development , he notes , has been a focus since the mid- to late 1980s on the key role of religion in American life - and by extension , to all the traditions meeting under the roof of the public school . Schools now have clearly defined standards for teaching about religion , typically through history courses . Legal concerns are better understood as well , and the reemergence of religious discussion in American public life has made many people more comfortable with the topic . Haynes says Americans face a historic opportunity - and challenge - in confronting the issue in education . " For the first time , we have a widely shared consensus that teaching about religion is important and constitutional , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things in education , and treat it superficially . " But if that 's the approach , " we will lose support for public schools . " The issue , of course , goes beyond maintaining a constituency for public schools . " In the 21st century , one of the great challenges that is often ignored is how we will live with these religious differences , " he adds . " How are we going to negotiate these differences if we do n't understand one another ? " The trend is in the right direction , Haynes says . " We have more examples around the country of people doing a good job , crafting approaches that are more balanced , fair , and educational , " he notes . " People are not spinning their wheels . They have wonderful examples that say , ' We 've changed . ' " <p> George Marsden History Professor University of Notre Dame , Indiana By Mark Clayton Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor Can the personal religious views of professors and students reasonably inform intellectual debate in the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts him at the center of one of the hottest debates in higher education during the past decade and today . In his 1997 book " The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship , " the Notre Dame history professor proposes that " mainstream American higher education be more open to explicit discussion of the relationship of religious faith to learning . " In a recent interview , he expanded on this topic : Must the origins of Christianity - and specifically the birth of Christ - be taught in a certain way in order to be valid ? The crucial question is self-identification , so that one is not posing as a neutral observer - because no one is neutral on those types of questions . The problem is that , often , people will talk about the origins of Christianity as if they are neutral observers , whereas people either think it 's true or not . But they 're not neutral parties . You have to identify where you 're coming from . That 's only fair in a class where some are believers and some are not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civility with those with whom you differ . In a pluralistic setting , you get to express your views - but you have to respect others ' views , recognizing that you ca n't oblige everyone to agree with you . If you 're not a believer there 's the same thing : You ca n't impose your view as though every rational person has to think the way you do about it . Can Christian scholars teach about Christianity and be taken seriously ? As a scholar , you have to present arguments and evidence for views that you want to defend . You have to be prepared to say , " This is why I can believe this . " It 's not necessary to present all your arguments for everything you believe , every time you present your religious faith . But you have to provide some intellectual accountability for why you believe what you believe . It ca n't be a situation where anything goes . Is the teaching of Christian history today what it should be , or has an anti-Christian tilt among higher-education scholars made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as it 's been . There 's more recognition now of the need for varieties of perspective , including religious perspectives . So there 's been some success in getting that to be recognized ... A better way to talk about it is that " faith based , " not just Christian perspectives , need to be recognized in the classroom . The only reason I talk about Christian scholarship in the title of my book is that I happen to be Christian , but what I am arguing really applies to any faith-based point of view . What do you mean by Christian scholarship ? " Christian " is an ambiguous word because there are so many varieties of Christianity . So it needs other qualifiers . When talking about scholarship , one needs other adjectives , like conservative Catholic , or liberal Protestant , or others . All are particular subtypes . What else should a professor with a private religious viewpoint bring to a classroom discussion on religion ? It might help to explain how your religious perspective shapes other perspectives you have . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reason , he might explain that as the source of his belief in pacifism . One 's view on marriage and the family might be shaped by some religious perspective or another . There 's a whole series of things that might be impacted by your religious beliefs . It 's not that your judgments might be unique to your religion , but that they might be the source . If I 'm teaching about Christmas from a Christian perspective , I might decry the commercialism of Christmas , because I might see it as antithetical to the real spirit of Christianity - so there are implications that go with particular religious perspectives . Another might decry materialism , but from a different sort of basis . There are all sorts of people in academia , including many very religious people . All I 'm saying is , just be upfront about that . More often than not , people in academia will be skeptical of more-typical religious claims - and they 're free to do that . Others with more traditional religious views should be free to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against religion among some academics - and that it 's good to be aware of that . <p> James Fraser Professor of History and Education Dean of the School of Education at Northeastern University , Boston . By Marjorie Coeyman Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor In the 30 years he 's been teaching on college campuses , James Fraser says he 's never before seen such intense interest in spirituality on campus as he has in the last five years . " There is a real desire among students to understand religious traditions and to be in touch with a spiritual core , " says Professor Fraser , a professor of history and education and dean of the School of Education at Northeastern University in Boston . But that desire does not mean that the public expression of thoughts about the religious significance of Christmas extends beyond the enjoyment of the occasional Christmas carol . " In higher education in general , the religious significance of Christmas in general is n't mentioned , " says Fraser , who is also the author of " Between Church and State : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Most universities are pretty secular places . About this time of the year , people are either getting ready for exams or on break . " The fact remains , Fraser says , that contemplation of the Christmas story , like most things related to faith and spirituality , is considered a personal matter , something appropriate in a faith-based community , but not in an academic one . It 's a distinction he considers important . " Universities make a mistake when they try to fill that role , " he says . " As a professor and as a practicing Christian , I would not find it comfortable to spend a lot of time in class discussing the birth of Jesus . " Certainly , he says , the birth of Jesus is taught as a historic event , and the life and birth of the Christian movement remain topics entirely appropriate to the classroom . But the biblical story surrounding the birth is not focused on much , he says , in part because there is little historical record surrounding it , apart from the narratives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church itself , he says , did not stress the birth of Jesus much in the first 1,000 years or so of its existence . In fact , says Fraser , it 's a little-noted irony of history that although many today bemoan the loss of the religious sense of Christmas , few remember that celebrating the birth of Jesus was not always part of the Christian tradition - at least , not in a religious sense . The focus on Christmas really began when the Christian church started reaching out to the pagan world and incorporating some of its customs . Because the winter solstice is a major holiday in paganism , the church turned to the birth of Jesus to create an equivalent winter celebration . " It was a smart move , " Fraser says . " It made it easier for some people to convert . " But for the early Protestants , he points out , the celebration of Christmas was viewed with skepticism . And during the colonial period in the United States , the celebration of Christmas was outlawed by some Puritan settlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered a Catholic holiday , " Fraser says . " In the colony of Massachusetts , there are records of people who were fined for celebrating it . " While Fraser agrees that a focus on the Christmas story itself is inappropriate in American education , he says he is troubled by how the holidays are treated in many public schools , which often secularize or ignore the holidays out of fear of lawsuits or discord . It 's possible , Fraser says , to impart a sense of the beauty of the various traditions celebrated at the end of the year , including the Christmas tradition , without leaning too heavily on any one tradition , or having an inappropriate religious discussion . " This can become an opportunity to really celebrate the diversity of our students , " he says . " It 's a learning opportunity that it 's a shame to miss . " The solution to the dilemma of dealing with religious holidays in schools , he says " is not silence . " David Hollinger History professor University of California , Berkeley By Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions the legitimacy of religion as a basis for intellectual debate in the college classroom . An intellectual historian who teaches at the University of California , Berkeley , he participated in a three-year Lilly Foundation-sponsored seminar on the role of religion in higher education . He is author of a forthcoming article entitled " Enough Already : Universities Do Not Need More Christianity . " In an interview , he talked about religion 's growing reemergence into the intellectual stream of the college classroom : " There are many aspects of religious history that are not taught because of the quaint idea that if you teach religion , you have to believe in it . Religion is much too important to be left in the hands of people that believe in it . " We 've got a certain structure of plausibility that 's been established since the Enlightenment about what shall count as evidence and reasoning . " Insofar as something carries the label of religion - if it can pass muster within that structure of plausibility - fine . The difficulty comes when somebody says this whole structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you end up saying that something is scientifically true because it is warranted by the Bible , spiritual intuition , what the Pope says , and so on . " The main line of academic culture since the enlightenment has been to diminish religious authority . " We now go on the basis of scientific evidence . When we want to know what 's true , we do not consult the Bible , we do not consult the Pope , we do not consult any religious authority - even our own religious institutions . We consult scientific evidence . " <p> Jewelnel Davis University Chaplain Columbia University , New York By Marjorie Coeyman Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor When Jewelnel Davis offered an invocation at Columbia University 's annual Yule log ceremony , she touched lightly on some of the world 's major belief systems - Christian , Jewish , Hindu , pagan , Muslim - and found in them all the common theme of light dispelling darkness . Searching out spiritual connections among different faiths is " how we have to do it " when we celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is trained as a Baptist minister . As communities become more sophisticated and diverse , she says , the only way to touch on religious themes and yet remain inclusive is to seek out points of similarity . The rise in multiculturalism does not make the holidays a time to back away from spiritual questions . On the contrary , she says , the number of students who seek her out for pastoral counseling always increases markedly between Thanksgiving and mid-February . Holidays bring to the surface unresolved parent-child issues , while for others , any sense of sadness about not belonging to the right family group or romantic twosome becomes more intense . Often , Davis says , those coming to her for help at this time of year are really looking for spiritual answers . " They move to the existential questions below the emotional issues , " she says . " They are really asking , ' What is the purpose of it all ? ' " Fundamentally , Davis says , the holidays sound " a very joyous and positive note . " This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consciously reached out to different religious traditions , she says she looked around at the faces of those in the room and felt full of " a sense of joy that we 're all in it together . " She likes to focus on a sense of renewal , of " who we are as people in the context of a larger picture . " Underneath the different types of celebrations , she says , " I think that 's what the holidays mean for each religion . " For Jews , she says , at Hanukkah , the question is " ' Is there enough oil ? ' and the answer to that question is , ' There is always enough oil for God 's people . ' " For those who celebrate Kwanzaa , she says , the question might be , ' Can we stand ? ' and the answer , ' Yes , we can stand because God stands with us . ' In both cases , she says , the real message is sufficiency . " The people are sufficient , the community is sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the holidays offer an opportunity to be less self-conscious about affirming various religious faiths . " As much as religion is public , it 's also intimate , " she says . That can sometimes cause reluctance to ask questions or make reference to the different beliefs of a friend . But opportunities abound to do so in an unobtrusive fashion . Her own office as chaplain happens to be across the hall from the room where campus Muslims celebrated the breaking of the fast of Ramadan this year . Many of the celebrants stopped by her office to say happy holidays , and she said she loves having the chance to refer to their celebration and , in a sense , say , " I want to affirm you as a Muslim . " Far from sidestepping religion during the holidays , Davis says , this is " a time when we can be more intentional and deliberate about acknowledging our differences and celebrating the diversity among us . " <p> Jill Kirschner Director of Jewish student life Long Island University , Brookville New York By Marjorie Coeyman Staff writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jill Kirschner sees greater connections - not only between students of similar religious backgrounds , but between students and their own religious traditions . Still in the first year of her new job as director of Jewish student life at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University , she has n't yet fathomed the interests of all the students she serves . But this month , one attraction has become very clear : The holiday season makes many gravitate toward religion-based gatherings . " Because the holidays are made into such a big deal , " Ms. Kirschner says , " the general population that would n't normally get involved with anything religious is suddenly looking to get involved . " From her point of view , " it 's a great time to connect with those students who do n't normally think of themselves as religious . " Although the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah , which commemorates the rededication of the Temple of Jerusalem , is not traditionally one of the major Jewish holidays , its celebration has been heightened by many Western Jews because it coincides with Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional games and have the traditional food , " she says . " We have a student read the history and the Hanukkah story at the party , and we explain why we celebrate , why we light the menorah , why the traditions exist . " Kirschner says that especially at Christmas time , " the Jewish students wanted something to call their own . " Not all the students Kirschner works with come from strongly religious backgrounds . In fact , she says , they tend to divide into two groups . One set of Jewish students she sees comes from homes where they received formal religious training and are well tutored in Jewish tradition . Members of another group , she says , know relatively little about their own religious background . But the first group , she says , is generally ready and eager to teach the second , and occasions like the Hanukkah party can be ideal moments to do so . In terms of actual interest in religion itself , Kirschner says the holidays do n't create any increased spiritual hunger . The degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school year . In fact , in some ways , the holidays are difficult because they compete with the exam season . While some students seem eager throughout the year to reach out for religious guidance , others see that as a secondary concern . " They 're thinking first about their careers , their social lives , the role they will play , " she says . " Religion may come later . " But even among the Jewish students who may not be particularly religious , Kirschner says she does sense an interest in seeking out a feeling of solidarity - and the desire for that solidarity may well become more intense during the holidays . " Maybe it 's because Jews are a minority , " she says , speaking of her campus , where only about 10 percent of the 10,000 undergraduates are Jewish . Or maybe , she says , it 's just a normal tendency for any group . " They are seeking out those who are like them , " she adds . <p> Lewis Barker Psychology Professor Auburn University , Alabama By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barker tries to be open-minded about religion in the college classroom . But " what does any of this stuff mean , " he wonders , if one is , for example , researching neurotransmitters in the brain ? " I have no problem with people who want to have a discussion about religion - or anything else they want to talk about . If someone wants to integrate faith and learning , that 's fine , " says Dr. Barker , who teaches psychology at Auburn University . He recently left Baylor University in Waco , Texas , after nearly three decades , in part because he did n't like the fresh emphasis at the Baptist-affiliated university on integrating faith into the classroom . " My misgiving is the extent to which it becomes institutional policy to integrate faith and learning ... Universities are always going to change . But this trend toward integration of faith and learning is a different type of change . This is a return to the way universities were at the turn of century ... reclaiming ground lost to a secular century . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to write how I would integrate faith and learning . Then that sets the tone for what 's important , what you have to do to get tenure . It will impact what we offer in classrooms , the kind of scholarship we 're engaged in . " But it 's not clear to me how you take something as secular as science - the neuroscience that I 'm involved with - and integrate this with faith issues ... I do n't have any inside knowledge that secular universities are the way things should be . I am convinced that I function best within a more pluralistic situation . " People can integrate faith and learning till the cows come home . But I 'm against it being institutional policy . I 've had the academic freedom to do what I want to do at Baylor , to publish secular scientific articles . So I do n't want to come across as whining . But in terms of what the university is trying to do - it 's going down a track to the 19th century . " <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
