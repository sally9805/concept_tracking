When Anna Jantzen(1) got a call from a friend inviting her daughter over to play on the weekend , she was n't sure what to say . The truth was , two-year-old Eve could go only if she could " go . " If not , she 'd be so miserable and in such pain , there would n't be any point . Jantzen knew it seemed crazy . But crazy pretty much summed up their life ever since Eve began withholding her bowel movements a few months earlier . They now stayed at home most days because Eve 's bizarre rocking and moaning from the pain made even a trip to the library out of the question . Instead , Jantzen spent much of her time trying to coax her little girl to go poop . They read books like Once Upon a Potty , they watched videos , but nothing worked . The withholding had started with a trip to the emergency ward . " Eve had been screaming and crying all day , " says the London , Ontario , mother , " and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected a bladder infection . When Eve refused to provide a urine sample , the medical team tried to catheterize her . Eve became hysterical so Jantzen stopped the procedure . It took her more than an hour to calm her child . Later , another doctor discovered the problem was labial adhesion ( where the labia fuse together ) . This occurs in roughly four percent of young girls and makes urination painful and difficult . ( It 's easily remedied by applying a topical estrogen cream . ) Graph Not Transcribed Over the next few days Eve became upset when she had to go to the bathroom , telling her mom it would hurt again like in the hospital . She eventually became less afraid of peeing , but remained convinced that pooping would hurt . For the first month or so , she would withhold for three or four days before relenting . But gradually she kept it in longer and longer , until she was routinely going from ten to 14 days between bowel movements . Graph Not Transcribed Jantzen spent months trying to get help for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's diet , though it was already loaded with fruits , vegetables and whole grains . Jantzen pressed her for more help and was referred to a paediatrician . He chalked it up to typical toddler behaviour , citing Eve as " clever and wilful , a bad combination . " But Jantzen knew it was n't stubbornness or contrariness . She knew her daughter was terrified . Nonetheless she took his advice and gave Eve large doses of mineral oil and Lansoyl , a mineral oil in jelly form . Neither helped . Eve coped with the cramping pain by rocking , moaning , crying , even babbling almost in a chant . " It was like she became a baby again , just wanting to be held and rocked and to suck her thumb . She barely ate for days because she was so bloated . " But in spite of hours of reassuring , explaining , cajoling , begging  --  even bribing  --  Jantzen could not get Eve to go . In desperation , she and her husband began giving their daughter suppositories , which Eve strongly resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then became ineffective . A third doctor advised milk of magnesia and forcing the little girl to sit on the toilet each night after dinner until she had a bowel movement . Eve balked . She spat out the milk of magnesia , and neither Jantzen nor her husband could cope with their daughter 's panic when they tried to hold her on the toilet . In the meantime , Eve 's behaviour became even more difficult . " I could n't take her anywhere , " says Jantzen , except for about two days following a bowel movement when she would seem like her former happy self . Then the discomfort would set in and she 'd start the rocking and moaning . By day five , the pain would be so bad Eve would spend her whole day on Jantzen 's burgeoning lap ( she was pregnant again ) . The toddler often cried herself to sleep , then slept fitfully , moaning and weeping . She was utterly exhausted . Jantzen saw no end in sight . " No one seemed to take the problem seriously and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not like ear infections , " she says . " You do n't discuss your child 's bowel problems over a cup of coffee with another mom . " Finally , though , she did confide in a friend , who put her in touch with another woman whose daughter was having the same problem as Eve . The road eventually led to Michelle McNeill , a paediatrician in London , Ontario , who reassured Jantzen that her child was n't abnormal . In fact , she said , she was seeing up to three kids a week with this same problem . Withholding bowel movements is surprisingly common among children , usually around toilet-training age . In fact , it accounts for roughly four percent of visits to a paediatrician and 35 percent of all visits to a paediatric gastroenterologist . A quick abdominal exam revealed that Eve was definitely backed up  --  her intestine was full almost back to her stomach . But McNeill had succeeded with worse cases . She recommended the following treatment : Eve would be put on Peg-Lyte , a polyethylene glycol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery . After a 48-hour " clean out " phase , during which her bowels would empty , she 'd move to a maintenance phase , which would last for three to six months . Eve would be kept on just enough Peg-Lyte ( available over the counter at pharmacies ) to keep her having one or two soft bowel movements a day . This would give her bowel , weakened and distended from so much withholding , time to regain its shape and proper nerve functioning . Then Eve would be slowly weaned off the Peg-Lyte . McNeill assured Jantzen this plan usually worked . If Eve had trouble ingesting the Peg-Lyte on her own ( some kids refuse to take it because of the taste ) , she would be hospitalized and a tube would be inserted into her stomach to get the solution in . But that , promised the doctor , would be a last resort . Over the next few weeks , Eve wore diapers , since the medication gave her less control . But before long , she was routinely using the potty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It still took a fair bit of cajoling , but the stress in our home  --  even with a newborn  --  was nothing like it had been . " In the year since then , Jantzen has learned of more and more families coping with this problem  --  like the Rollings , also from London . Their ten-year-old son , Andrew , has been withholding since he was an infant ( he first became constipated at 21/2 weeks ) . It took his mother until he was seven to finally find a doctor who could help : John Howard , a gastroenterologist at London 's Children 's Hospital of Western Ontario ( CHWO ) . Andrew , who worries about the social stigma of his bowel problems , is also seeing Erica Gold , a psychologist who works with Howard at a clinic for such kids at CHWO . Graph Not Transcribed " We noticed a need a few years ago , " remarks Gold , who hesitates to comment on how many kids are affected by this problem since there are no hard stats , saying only , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of his 3,000 patients , affecting children from three months to 18 years , though the most common age is two or three . What are the causes ? No one can say , though Howard notes that it happens more frequently in kids who are later diagnosed with learning disabilities or problems such as attention deficit disorder . Experts speculate that those kids may be less aware of or concerned with bodily functions and therefore ignore signs that they need to go . Gold believes there 's a danger of " overpathologizing the problem "  --  for example , blaming it on deep-seated emotional troubles or sexual abuse . There 's usually no clear-cut trigger , she says , though doctors will rule out medical issues such as muscular or thyroid problems , or Hirschsprung 's disease , a rare condition where the colon lacks the nerve cells that enable intestinal muscles to move stool through . Howard 's treatment is similar to McNeill 's . The first step is an osmotic agent , such as Peg-Lyte , milk of magnesia pills or Lactulose syrup to clean out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased dosage for six weeks to three months to allow the colon to return to its normal size and shape and for the child to experience pain-free poops . Psyllium is added to the diet ( available in Metamucil and generically from drugstores and health food stores ) to keep the stools relatively loose . Then the child is weaned off the osmotic agent . Nonetheless , says Howard , " kids will revert 20 percent of the time  --  most commonly because of a psychological component , " so treatment is simply started over . Some kids are on it for six months , others for years . Eve Jantzen relapsed and started withholding again three months after she 'd stopped taking Peg-Lyte . Her mom put her on a tiny dose every day to get her back on track . While some parents worry about the long-term use of laxatives with children  --  indeed the Peg-Lyte container offers a caveat : " Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established "  --  Howard and McNeill both insist it 's safe . " However , use of it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Howard , who recently completed a clinical trial of 100 children with this problem . Meanwhile , the parents contacted for this article were thrilled that a story about chronic withholding was finally going to make it into mainstream media . " If there had been something  --  anything  --  to point me in the right direction long ago , I 'd have been so grateful , " says Jantzen . Lisa Rollings adds , " If I can help one child and one family not to have to go through this , it 'll be worth it . " " I did n't know a soul who was going through it . It 's not like ear infections . You do n't discuss your child 's bowel problems over a cup of coffee with another mom . " ( 1 ) Name changed by request . <p>
