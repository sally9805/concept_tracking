DIP INTO " DANGER " Headnote SOLITUDE ON THE SAN JUAN IS EASY TO FIND . JUST IGNORE THE WARNING SIGNS . // " Danger ! Waterfall ahead ! This is your last take-out point before the falls . " The warning sign shouts at us from Clay Hills Crossing on southern Utah 's San Juan River . This is the place most river runners take out . Except us . We 're putting in . A gaggle of sun-baked rafters pull their massive pontoons ashore , ending a week on the upper San Juan . They gawk in disbelief as we launch our kayaks just below the " Danger ! " sign . My husband , Mike , paddles from the stern while I manage 3-year-old Austin in the front cockpit . Melissa , Buck , and their 5-year-old son , Zach , point their two kayaks downstream . We must seem like an apparition to the rafters , or just plain foolish . " Y'all are crazy ! " shouts a potbellied man from the sandy bank above us . " Those falls have a 50-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddling . As the swift chocolate waters of the San Juan quickly carry us out of earshot , I do n't have a chance to tell him that we have every intention of portaging around the waterfall . And that we are just trying to get away from people , people like him . Our plan is to paddle 100 miles down the San Juan arm of Lake Powell and into the reservoir 's main channel . It 's one of the most remote stretches of water in the Southwest , thanks to the waterfall , which blocks rafters better than a brick wall , and the absence of gas stations on this side of Lake Powell , which keeps motor boats away from the downstream portion . A ranger told us we 'd hit the falls within the first mile , so we move cautiously through a few rifles , listening for the expected roar . We intend to pull ashore and make a grueling portage , slogging through quicksandlike silt and dense tamarisk to get around the dangerous drop-off . But there is no waterfall . The brown waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservoir of Lake Powell . Turns out a change in the lake 's water levels has swallowed the dreaded waterfall . " That sure was a tough portage , " jokes Buck . " Judging by the quality of that information , we must be the first people in years to venture this far down the river . " Indeed , we 're headed into waters few , even Glen Canyon 's backcountry rangers , travel . I 'm relieved we got off so easy , but I still feel some trepidation . Maybe we are a little " crazy " to be committing to such a significant wilderness journey with young children in tow . If something were to go wrong , we 're many rugged miles from the nearest human contact . The wide , shallow portal into Lake Powell is behind us and we enter a narrower channel lined by towering , rust-colored rock walls that cast a near-permanent shadow over the water . A mild April breeze , the gentle rocking of the boat , and the rhythmic splash of our paddles lulls Austin to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell is an astounding treasure . But this beauty came at a price . As we paddle , we wonder what this canyon might have looked like before Glen Canyon dam ( completed in 1963 ) started holding back the waters of numerous rivers , flooding countless side canyons on its way to creating the largest manmade reservoir in the United States . The lower San Juan River and Glen Canyon used to be a hiker 's paradise , lined with lush cottonwood trees and filled with ancient Anasazi ruins . Now it all lies in a watery grave . Dead cottonwood trees scratch the bottom of our boat like a skeleton 's bony fingers , reminding us of the loss . And yet , if Lake Powell had n't been created , I would n't be paddling here for 2 weeks with my family . It 's the reservoir 's flat water that makes this extended wilderness experience possible . And there 's a bevy of other benefits : sandy beaches , plentiful deadwood for campfires , great fishing , and gentle slickrock benches for napping and reading . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has its wild moments . A sudden wind whips the water into a frenzy as we enter an open bay . Mike grunts with every stroke , digging hard with his paddle in a struggle to keep the boat moving forward . Waves lap over the bow of our kayak and Austin wakes from another nap with icy spray in his face . " Looks like it 's time to find a campsite , " shouts Buck over the wind . Rule Number I on this kid-friendly expedition : If the water is rough , stay in camp . We pull into a sheltered inlet called Mike 's Canyon and set up our tents on a broad , flat beach surrounded by sloping orange slickrock . Each family retreats to its securely staked-out tent . The wind is blowing so hard that sand creeps under the tent fly and dusts us through the mesh walls . But that blowing sand is the most discomfort we 'll experience for the entire 2 weeks . Our 100mile paddle is as long as an expedition , with as many discoveries , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Canyon , our three-kayak flotilla rounds the Great Bend of the inundated river and presses on to Alcove Canyon , Zahn Bay , and Cha Canyon , steadily descending the massive San Juan arm . The days take on the relaxed rhythm of water lapping against canyon walls : We paddle 6 to 10 miles in the morning ( when the lake is calm ) ; we spend afternoons lounging in camp or exploring nearby side canyons ; we study how ravens soar and fish swim . Our world is simply water , rock , and sky . " Can we live here ? " Austin asks . " No , " I tell him . " We 're going home in a few days . " He begins to cry at the thought of leaving , which for me is the undeniable sign of a successful trip . With the breeze at our backs , we reach the main channel of Lake Powell a day ahead of schedule . At sunset , as houseboats putter past our campsite , we raise mugs of Tang for a toast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the San Juan arm , " says Buck . He 's joking , but it may well be true . I add another toast : " To the Danger ! ' sign at Clay Hills . May it forever stand so that we can have the San Juan arm all to ourselves .
