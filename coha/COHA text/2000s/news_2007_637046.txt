<p> Hundreds of property owners along a zigzag path up the west side of metro Atlanta could soon have a massive new natural gas pipeline for a neighbor . <p> Georgia Power is sending letters to property owners along 19 miles of its transmission lines , saying it plans to build a pipeline underneath those lines . <p> It unveiled the path of the proposed pipeline Tuesday , confirming what some East Point residents had suspected since December , when a Piney Woods subdivision homeowner spotted a Georgia Power surveyor on the transmission right of way next door . <p> The 30-inch pipeline  --  six to eight times as large as a typical Atlanta Gas Light distribution pipeline  --  will connect to an interstate pipe near Union City and travel up to Georgia Power 's Plant McDonough near Smyrna , zigging through a section of East Point as it follows existing transmission corridors . <p> The pipeline is part of a good news story from an environmental point of view : It will feed new gas plants at the McDonough site , allowing Georgia Power to shutter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is now the largest single contributor to metro Atlanta 's bad air quality , and its closing will mean significant improvements : The new gas units would put out 95 percent less of the chemicals that cause smog , for instance . <p> Construction will begin in 2009 , assuming the state Public Service Commission approves the new gas plants that require the pipeline . The PSC will decide that this summer . <p> ' Already overburdened ' <p> But some residents say the pipeline is bad news for transmission corridor neighbors in communities like East Point , a fact that has already led to a series of rallies and protests over the past three months . <p> State Sen. Vincent Fort ( D-Atlanta ) , who represents the area , has been up in arms : " This is an area that 's already overburdened " with pass-through utility lines , he said . " They went from one set of transmission lines to larger transmission lines and now a natural gas pipeline , which will devalue their property and create safety issues . " <p> Georgia Power says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , that pipelines have a good safety record nationally and that the proposed location on an existing right of way will cut down on one of the most common risks for pipelines  --  ruptures from construction work . <p> Company spokesman John Sell said the proposed pipeline route is the " most practical and least disruptive to the community , " in large part because so much of it tracks existing utility right-of-way corridors . Roughly 95 percent of the pipeline would be in an existing transmission right of way , he said . <p> The company estimates that it will have to negotiate easement compensation for approximately 330 properties along the route , including 210 residential properties , of which 140 to 150 are in East Point . <p> Georgia Power has aerial easement rights along its transmission corridors , but not underground rights . <p> Sell and Ben Harris , Georgia Power 's executive vice president for land , said the company will consider the nuisance of the construction work in addition to the value of the easements themselves . <p> That work will last only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could take up to a couple of months in more challenging areas . <p> The pipeline will also pass under the Chattahoochee River and several small creeks . <p> It will be buried at least 5 feet deep in most locations , and at least 25 feet deep under the river and creeks , Harris said . <p> And it will begin sloping under the river at least 1,000 feet out , leaving riverside buffers undisturbed , Sell and Harris said . <p> The PSC will be weighing both the McDonough gas plants and the pipeline as part of an ongoing " integrated resource plan , " which decides what resources Georgia Power needs in the future . The case has a series of hearings planned this spring , and will be decided on July 12 . <p> Residents unhappy <p> East Point has been buzzing about the pipeline since a resident named Ed Dowlen sounded the alarm in December , after seeing a surveyor in action . Until this week , the company confirmed only that it was considering building a pipeline but had n't decided to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are definitely going to be unhappy about this , " Dowlen said Tuesday . <p> The accidental disclosure of the proposed pipeline and lack of information afterwards infuriated Fort , who said Georgia Power had no business planning a pipeline in his district without informing the community or him . <p> He helped organize neighborhood rallies and a January protest outside Georgia Power 's headquarters , and wrote to company Chief Executive Mike Garrett demanding that he disclose the pipeline 's route . <p> East Point resident Beth Gross , who lives a house away from the proposed route , said she and her neighbors were frustrated by the lack of information , too . <p> " They 've been saying they do n't know where it will go , but they 've got ribbons all over and they 're painting marks on the streets , and taking pictures of people 's driveways , " she said . <p> Gross is not happy that the pipeline will go near her house . <p> At 84 , she said , " I 'm not anxious to be moving . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never quite looks the same , that it always looks like a road went through . " <p> Opposition is likely to continue . East Point 's government intends to formally intervene at the PSC . <p> And Fort says he plans to keep fighting the pipeline . <p> In rolling out its plans Tuesday , Georgia Power made Fort its first stop  --  or tried to . <p> The company sent a team of executives , including Garrett , to a scheduled briefing at Fort 's Senate office early in the morning . <p> Unbeknownst to Georgia Power , Fort had invited a television reporter and the city attorney of East Point . <p> The Georgia Power team walked out . Fort accused Georgia Power of trying to control what went on in his office . <p> Georgia Power said it later sent an informational packet on the proposed pipeline to Fort 's office , via courier . <p> COMING DOWN THE PIPE <p> * Starting this week : Affected property owners to get letters from Georgia Power . <p> * Next several months : Those owners to get house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 11 and 16 : Scheduled opportunities for public comment at Public Service Commission . <p> * July 12 : PSC vote . <p> * Spring 2009 : Construction start date , if approved . <p> * Summer 2010 : Pipeline operational . <p> HOW DO I GET INVOLVED ? <p> * Contact the PSC at 404-656-4501 or gapsc@psc.state.ga.us <p> * Attend PSC public hearings . <p> * Call your state legislators .
