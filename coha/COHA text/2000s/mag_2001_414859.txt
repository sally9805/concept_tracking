" Rene and I stood for a long moment , embracing and crying , " Celine says of the afternoon she found out she was pregnant . " I think about that moment every day . " On the windswept flatlands outside Montreal lies a sleepy little suburb of auto shops and strip malls called Terrebonne . There on the main drag is a restaurant called Nickels , one of a chain of fifties-style American diners that seem oddly out of place amid the predominantly French signage of Quebec . Behind the register , a bespectacled woman of a certain age rings up Kraft macaroni et fromage and Cokes with a dour , matronly efficiency . Photograph // She scowls as I approach . " Oui , " she mutters with a cool stare , she is Claudette . " Oui , " she is the owner .

She barely talks to her . She gets news of the pregnancy just like you do , in the newspapers . " This seems odd , even jarring .

" Celine wants a normal life . That 's what she told everybody when she left the stage . She wants to go home and do some cooking and live a normal life , and you ca n't have the spotlight around you and have a normal life . " Suddenly free of the on-the-go-every-second schedule that was her existence for years , the singer has discovered a new side to life-and to herself . " I would have never imagined that I would live so many transformations in such a short time , " Dion recently told Paris Match magazine .

" Now I find myself getting up early , looking at flowers , listening to birds singing . I 've been spending entire evenings watching TV , which I have never done before in my life . I 've even gotten hooked on hockey . I have n't been listening to music anymore  --  mine or anyone else 's . " " We talk about life these days , not business , " echoes Lemay . " Right now what 's important is her baby . " WHAT KIND OF MOTHER WILL SHE BE ? Dion 's only real job this year will be tending to her due-any-minute baby boy , whom she is considering naming after his daddy and her husband-manager , Rene Anaelil. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dion was holed up in her mansion outside Montreal before heading to Florida to give birth . While in Quebec , her mother , known to all as " Maman , " would arrive almost daily to cook for her daughter . Dion 's nephew Sebastien Dion Gaudet , who runs another Nickels , in nearby Repentigny , says Maman " likes to make Celine 's favorite dish , pati chinois , " which turns out to be a sort of shepherd 's pie . " Celine loves to eat , " he adds . " Especially now . " Everyone who knows Dion says she will throw herself into motherhood with the same drive and determination that powered her career . " She is her mother 's daughter , " says Alan Hustak , an arts reporter for the Montreal Gazette and a professional Celine watcher . " Quebec is a very matriarchal society .

The baby , he predicts , " will look just like Rene , with those velvet eyes . " Germain watched Dion grow up and says she will make a spectacular mother-though she 'll have to check some of those " smothering " instincts . " I 've seen her with children very often , and I think she 'll be strict , " says Germain . " But maybe she 'll have to take care not to be too enveloping of the child , to give him some freedom . " Will she encourage him to follow her delicate footsteps into a music career ? " I do n't think so , " he says . " If he wants to be a musician , she can help him realize his dream . But she 's not pushy , you know ? " The scene in Jupiter , FL , where the baby will spend his first days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many members of the Dion clan will be scurrying about the singer 's mansion . Designed with guests in mind , the house has nine bedrooms , several kitchens , a movie theater , a dressmaking studio for Maman , 33 televisions , and a massive swimming pool with the couple 's initials intertwined on the bottom . In her book Dion calls it her " dream house . The house of happiness . And of love . " The baby planning began last year , when it became apparent that Angelil 's cancer-which prompted Dion to cancel part of her world tour in March 1999 in order to see him through treatment-was in remission . Just as they had feared , chemotherapy had rendered Angelil practically infertile . The couple was forced to go the in-vitro route . " She has been waiting for so long , and , you know , the way she got pregnant , it was n't very fun , " says Germain . " It 's been very technical . It was sometimes very humiliating . It was n't making love with her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of research , Dion and Angelil found Zev Rosenwaks , M.D. , director of the respected Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University-New York Presbyterian Hospital . " She 's ecstatic , " Rosenwaks says , confirming that the pregnancy took work , since Angelil 's semen profile was " subnormal . " Rosenwaks 's lab used a relatively new procedure called ICSI , or intracytoplasmic sperm injection , to isolate sperm cells and inject them directly into eggs removed from the mother . Doctors removed 18 eggs and fertilized them ; three days later they transferred the most viable embryos into Dion 's uterus . On June 8 of last year , one of Dion 's doctors dropped by unannounced to do some quick blood work , and told her she 'd know within a few days whether the procedure had worked . Mercifully , good news came sooner . " I faked being calm and distracted when Rene came by in the kitchen , " Dion said recently . " He was unaware of anything . He did n't know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my doctor , who shouted , Congratulations , lovers ! ' Rene and I stood for a long time , embracing and crying . I think about that moment every day , when I feel my little boy moving . " Three months into her pregnancy , a checkup clocked the fetal heartbeat at 162 beats per minute . " We made a recording of it , " Dion said . " And we listen to it every evening before going to bed . " " It 's been a perfectly normal pregnancy , " says Rosenwaks , who adds that Dion is in perfect health . And even better news may be forthcoming , in the form of another child : Dion revealed in a television interview in December that she has a second embryo in storage at the fertility clinic in New York . " So I have a twin , " she said jubilantly . " It 's called a laboratory twin . It does not mean they 're identical twins , but they were conceived at the same time . " Dion did n't say when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , " I will go get it-that 's for sure . " She added , " I surely could not live knowing that this child is there . " " YOU CAN SEE THE LOVE IN HER EYES " " With Celine , what you see is what you get , " says Hustak . " You wo n't find these people at five-star restaurants . They do n't have friends in Hollywood . This is backwoods-Quebec culture in action . She is a smalltown girl with all the money in the world . But money ca n't buy taste . " Photograph // The question of taste comes up again and again when discussing Dion . It 's a major bone of contention between fans and nonfans . Her over-the-top wedding in Montreal in 1994 , and her even more over-the-top vows renewal last year in Las Vegas-complete with camels , sedan chairs , and a costumed cast of onlookers  --  are two cases in point . Fans saw an elegant fairy-tale fantasy ; detractors saw tackiness and obscene wealth . " Celine is what the Quebecois affectionately call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some affection for Dion . " It means kitschy , tacky , bumpkin-like . Bill Clinton was ketaine as governor of Arkansas , though not as president . " Hustak uses more U.S. geography to drive home his point . " Celine comes from the South Shore , " he says . " It 's the Bronx of Montreal . " Dion talks and sings about love and undying devotion in a way that sends fans into fits of passion , while critics roll their eyes and insist that all the syrupy lyrics and lollipop love talk ca n't possibly be real . Or can it ? People put up with Dion 's overblown patter ( she once said with a straight face , " I need to make love . I need to share love " ) because she is so genuine  --  she really seems to mean every word . She is devoted to the notion that love is the only thing that matters-an almost refreshing view in a jaded , skeptical society . " Celine and Rene are extremely sweet people , " Hustak says . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . The gestures , the looks . You ca n't fake that . " It 's hard to find any fakery in Celine Dion at all . Her reputation for diva behavior seems to be based solely on the fact that she has a bad habit of thumping her chest while belting out " My Heart Will Go On . " By all accounts she 's kind , charitable , incredibly generous , and approachable . " She 's extraordinarily likable without ever being overbearing , " says CNN 's Larry King , who 's known her for years . " When she talks about her love for her husband and he 's out in the audience , that can be sentimental or maybe a little soap-opera-ish . But it just never is with her . I do n't know why , but I never feel like , Oh , stop with this already . ' That 's her . She loves her husband . She lets you know it . " King was especially impressed by Dion 's performance at a 1998 benefit for his heart disease foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She came with all these people , and never let us pay her expenses . " Dion sat at King 's table , " and people kept coming over , so we asked if she wanted security . And she said no , this is what she dreamed of all her life , to have people come by her table and say , " I like your work . ' ' " Dion has also helped bankroll the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation every year since 1982 . ( Her 16year-old niece , Karine , died of the disease in her arms in 1993 . ) And she contributes generously to the T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia , Cancer , and AIDS Research , founded by Sony Music Entertainment executive Tony Martell after his son died of cancer in 1975 . " She was just taken by my story . She heard of the work we do and just jumped in , " says Martell . Dion donates thousands of dollars a year to the foundation and has helped raise millions through her performances . " I was an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martell says . " I adored her then , and I adore her even more now , if that 's possible . " If anyone should adore Dion , it should be anyone who works at Sony , where Dion has done more to fatten the bottom line than any other recording artist . She is not simply a singer : She is a cottage industry whose current hiatus has left many people anxious , says Hustak . " Celine is a machine , with 200 to 300 people working on her tours , PR , recordings , and marketing . They 're all out of work now . " But even with the music stilled ( for now ) , Celine , Inc. is humming along . There is the interest in Nickels ( Dion designs the uniforms herself ) , an artist management company , and a golf club . The couple also owns a music publishing company and sold exclusive rights to the photos for a 100-page souvenir wedding album , which flew off Canadian newsstands at $6.95 apiece . " People asked why , " says Hustak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my fans . " But they made a lot of money from that book . " IS THE CANCER REALLY GONE ? For all the joy that comes with babies and money , the specter of deadly disease still hangs over Dion and Angelil . Press accounts characterize his skin cancer  --  discovered on Dion 's thirty-first birthday-as " in remission . " But Angelil himself " has never used that word , " according to Hustak . " Last time I saw him I asked about it . He said he lives from test to test , he counts his days every 30-to-60-day test period . " Photograph " Nothing will ever be the same , " says Dion , posing on a deck of her Florida home . // The story of Dion and Angelil 's romance has now entered the realm of myth . The youngest of 14 children , Dion was living on the hardscrabble outskirts of Montreal and was a " very , very shy person , often alone , " recalls Chantal Fiset , a childhood friend . But she loved to sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed with Angelil , a well-known but then broke music manager who eventually mortgaged his house to finance her debut album . " From then on , Rene was part of the family , " Dion recalls in her memoir . " My sisters and mother thought he was really handsome . He was always very elegant . And he had a mysterious , exotic side to him . " The young singer became secretly infatuated with her manager , 26 years her senior . In her fantasies , he " would come to my bed to take me away to a desert island where we made love . " Dion and Angelil became romantically involved in 1988 , but kept the affair secret for fear of public reaction to their age difference . ( Angelil has three grown children from a previous marriage ; he could become both a father and a grandfather this year . ) " All that time she spent loving Rene and did n't tell anyone , " says biographer Germain . When Dion read the first draft of his book , she told Germain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time . But I was in love with Rene and we were making love together . So I was happy . " WILL CELINE EVER COME BACK ? To care for Angelil and her baby , Dion went on a hiatus that she announced at a Montreal news conference in the fall of 1999 . There would be a few more concerts , she said , along with a big farewell performance on New Year 's Eve , at the Molson Centre in Montreal . That turned out to be an emotional night . " There 's nowhere in the world that I 'd rather be than here tonight , " a teary Dion told 21,000 roaring fans , adding : " It 's not just my last performance , but the start of a new life for Rene and me . " That new life pivots on the idea of family . As her retreat into seclusion enters its next , and most exciting , phase she will be happily occupied with child and husband . Most people say life without Rene would be unthinkable for Celine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become of Celine , " says Hustak . " Of course , if he lives , in 20 years he 'll be 80 . But Rene is her lover , manager , friend , agent , and life partner . What would happen if he were no longer there ? " It 's a question that lingers in the air around the couple . But at this point Angelil seems robust and healthy , and nearly everyone believes Dion will return to her career after the baby 's first year . " I 'm sure she will go back , " says Germain . " I saw Cirque du Soleil with her . She was in tears , it was so beautiful . She started talking about how she wanted to do the same thing for her next show , with a big stage and all that . " Still , there are skeptics . Hustak says , " I think she wants to go back to being a naive French-Canadian girl , " scoffing at rumors that Dion is itching to play Edith Piaf in an upcoming film biography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will on occasion , but mostly I think she will just be a very devoted French-Canadian mother . " But that is n't how Dion is sounding as reports slowly filter out of the new nursery . In early December the stage she left seemed once again to be beckoning her . " I know I 'll come back with a new recording , " she said then . " I 'll have that and projects in movies , but I 'll also have a little boy . And nothing in my life will ever be the same again . " Photograph " Celine is very happy it 's a boy , " reports one friend . The baby , he predicts , " will look just like Rene , with those velvet eyes . " // <p>
