<p> They line up in droves : mostly guys , mostly young , eager for a casual dinner of burgers and body-slams . Inside the cavelike dining room of the World Wrestling Federation 's theme restaurant in New York 's Times Square , you 're supposed to watch TV while you eat - on a giant screen or on many smaller ones , all showing WWF action - despite what your mother taught you . Out in the lobby , patrons are being served up an appetizer of civic awareness . " Are you registered to vote ? " Dave Palmer asks patrons waiting to pay the $ 10 cover charge . Lots of folks say " yeah , " but not too convincingly . " They just want to get into the restaurant , " says Mr. Palmer of Youth Vote 2000 . " We 'll ask again when they go to the restroom . " Some , though , decline . " I do n't wan na get on jury duty , " says Jason Bussel , a freshman at Rutgers University in New Jersey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " as if no one had ever asked before . By 9 p.m. on a recent Monday , Palmer and three other volunteers had registered 36 new voters . This is painstaking work , renewing democracy one voter at a time . The quest to sign up young voters in this Manhattan eatery is just a small part of what is now a major effort across the nation to get young Americans involved in the democratic process . From 7-Eleven to Wal-Mart to the World Wide Web , an increasing number of outlets are getting into the act . But the challenge is unprecedented : This generation of young people is more disengaged from politics than previous ones . The reasons are as varied as the hair colors at a rave . Apathy and cynicism , widely evident , are rooted in educational changes such as less civics instruction , lifestyle patterns ( including TV-viewing habits ) , and even the effects of divorce , some analysts say . And politicians themselves - as well as media coverage of America 's political institutions - do not always live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications are obvious , " says a recent report from the Aspen Institute called " 30 Million Missing Voters " - the number of citizens age 18 to 30 who did n't vote in the 1996 presidential election . " If young Americans fail to vote , what is the future of American democracy ? " Young adults have always turned out at a lower rate than the voting-age population as a whole . When 18-year-olds got the vote in 1971 , that dragged the overall turnout rate down even more . Young adults tend to be less settled , and tend not to have the kids and mortgages that connect people to their communities - and to the elected officials who make decisions that affect them . But what concerns observers most is that as each successive generation matures , a smaller and smaller share is converting to the voting habit . Now , the civic-minded World War II generation is giving way to younger generations that , in growing proportions , never feel compelled to vote . TV 'S CHILDREN With just a month to go before election day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been lower . In the last presidential election , in 1996 , about one-third of 18- to 24-year-olds voted , against overall turnout of 49 percent . This lack of political involvement is , in part , fueled by cultural differences : Today 's youths were born and bred on television , where politics and politicians seldom get positive coverage . Political ads play down party differences , because candidates are always gunning for swing voters . Many young people do n't know the difference between Republicans and Democrats . In addition , many grew up in single-parent households and in families that did n't regularly have dinner together - a setting where children learn parental values , such as the importance of voting . As concern grows , voter-registration drives and outreach to youths have become more concerted : Rock the Vote , a touring voter-registration bus that started in 1990 , has been joined by MTV 's Choose or Lose , Rap the Vote , and the Smackdown Your Vote campaign on WWF . On the Web , you do n't have to surf too far to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy incentives like a college scholarship . But as turnout advocates discovered with the 1993 federal " motor voter " law - which allowed people to register to vote at motor vehicle departments - just because someone 's registered does n't mean they 'll bother to go to the polls . Soon , voter-registration drives will morph into get-out-the-vote campaigns . THE PROTEST SET Chadwick Kochanowski , a graduate student in philosophy and literature at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst , does n't vote . Actually , he did once , when he turned 18 , but he has n't since , " because there 's nothing I really care enough about to vote for . " He also decries how " commercial " national politics is - but he does n't see the system changing anytime soon . " It 's pretty much controlled tightly by people who want to keep it the way it is , " he says . His alienation is typical of young nonvoters today , many of whom do local volunteer work , but view government - and large institutions in general - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further outside the mainstream , are the legions of young protesters who took to the streets of Seattle , Washington , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , and Boston during the past year . Their causes are many - and some do vote - but interviews with a smattering of protesters at the summer political conventions revealed that many do not . They do n't want to support " the system " by participating in it . Then there are young adults like Dave Palmer and the three others helping him register voters at the WWF restaurant , who provide a sharp contrast to the young nonvoters coming here to dine . " My parents were activist , hippyish , " says Palmer , who as a child attended antinuclear rallies with his mother . " It instilled in me the values that I have today . " Jose Pardo , a diner at WWF , also demonstrates the kind of pressure family can bring : He walks up to Palmer with his older cousin , ready to register . " I lied before - I told you I was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin talked me into coming back out . " But for every voter-registration victory , there are larger forces weighing against young people engaging in the process . Even the presidential debates that started this week may be alienating young voters : The commission that sets the rules for participation - chaired only by a Republican and a Democrat - has made it difficult for a third-party candidate to qualify . Inclusion of a candidate like Ralph Nader , who has a youthful following , may have attracted more young viewers . On the eve of Tuesday 's first presidential debate , a survey by the Vanishing Voter project at Harvard University 's Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy reported that only 14 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds planned to watch most of the broadcast . Nearly half planned to watch none of it . Youth Vote 2000 - a coalition of 75 groups devoted to boosting civic participation among young adults - is circulating petitions to turn the Oct. 17 presidential debate into a youth debate , with young adults choosing the topics and asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEGLECT The point about America 's young adults is not that they 're a bunch of apathetic slackers , says Richard Thau , executive director of Third Millennium , an advocacy group for Generation Xers . It 's that they 're caught in a " cycle of mutual neglect " with politicians . " The candidates ignore young people , because young people do n't vote , and young people ignore candidates , because candidates do n't talk to them , " says Mr. Thau . Others call it the " issue gap . " Young voters are n't exactly thinking about prescription-drug benefits for seniors - a big campaign issue this fall . They want to hear about education , abortion , affirmative action , and gun control . Experts on youth voting are hard put to name many campaigns that are making especially big efforts to attract young voters . After all , campaign resources are finite , and rule No. 1 in marketing is to go after the people you 've won over in the past . In elections , that rules out most young adults , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than college students and are tougher to locate . One candidate , however , who is making a special effort to attract the youth vote is Rep. Tom Campbell ( R ) of California , who 's running a longshot campaign to unseat Dianne Feinstein ( D ) from her seat in the US Senate . In one television ad , Mr. Campbell - a Stanford University professor - is shown e-mailing a student to ask if he 's watching the political convention . The answer flashes back on the screen : " R U Kidding . " " Why not get involved ? " Campbell asks . " Cuz you ca n't make a difference , right ? Wrong ! Think like that , and the special interests and big money will always control the political process . " California may be a natural place to try to get out the youth vote : It has one of the youngest populations in the US , including 2.5 million college students . " Heck , we have nothing to lose , " says Andrea Jones , Campbell 's campaign manager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's presidential campaign , where she ran youth outreach . " We believe young people could really put us on the map . " In the university town of Madison , Wis. , first-term Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D ) went after the student vote hard two years ago . She recruited legions of young volunteers and ran an essay contest : " Top 10 Reasons to Vote for Tammy Baldwin , " with pizza for the winner . When she won a tough primary battle by just 1,500 votes , the local paper proclaimed a " youthquake " had erupted . This year , she 's inviting young people to create an ad aimed at their peers . The winning video will air on television . Among the presidential campaigns , the Gore camp in particular is making a special outreach to young voters . In addition to organizing volunteers on 600 college campuses , the campaign has put Karenna Gore Schiff , Vice President Al Gore 's 20-something daughter , front and center , hosting discussions between her father and young adults . The Bush campaign also fronted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spearhead youth outreach , but since he began law school this fall , the campaign 's youth effort has n't had as much emphasis . Overall , the political parties may be starting to " get it " about young voters , says Susan MacManus of the University of South Florida in Tampa , an expert on generational issues in politics . " This is the first election I 've found that , when I call up a political party and ask them to bring somebody to my class to recruit volunteers and get them involved , I 'm actually having the phone calls returned quickly , " says Ms. MacManus , who also chairs the Florida Elections Commission . " That 's a sign the parties know they 're on the ropes . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
