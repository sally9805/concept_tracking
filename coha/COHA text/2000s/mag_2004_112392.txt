CARLOS BELTRAN fears God but , evidently , not the glare of the postseason . The Astros ' centerfielder , a quiet , spiritual man who spent 6 1/2 years in the hinterlands of Kansas City before being traded to Houston on June 24 , has made a great deal of noise in this , his first postseason . " I was n't expecting this at all , " he said on Sunday at Minute Maid Park after his eighth home run in the playoffs -- which tied Barry Bonds 's record for a postseason , set in 2002 -- had given the Astros a 6 -- 5 victory in Game 4 and evened the National League Championship Series at 2 -- 2 . " I was just trying to do my job , not trying to break records . " // In the bottom of the seventh , with one out and the game tied 5 -- 5 , Beltran dipped down like a golfer and scooped a 2-and-2 slider from St. Louis righthander Julian Tavarez into the right-centerfield bullpen . It was a record fifth straight postseason game in which Beltran hit a home run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell , who was watching from the on-deck circle , " because that pitch was in the dirt . " Beltran had seen two sliders earlier in the at bat and was sitting on a third , but the one he got , he plucked off an ant 's shoulders . ( Tavarez , who had tried to bounce the pitch , thereupon melted down , walking the next two batters and hitting a third before throwing a tantrum in the Cardinals ' dugout after the inning -- and breaking bones in his left hand punching the dugout phone -- all out of frustration at Beltran 's implausible reach. ) // But a playoff assault like Beltran 's can induce awe as well as hysteria . After Game 5 on Monday night , a 3 -- 0 victory that left the Astros one win from the first World Series in franchise history , Beltran had gone 18 for 39 ( .462 ) in 10 games with a .544 on-base percentage . The 6 ' 1 " , 190pound Beltran , with characteristic humility , says he does not consider himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .300 ( as he has done twice ) to slugging 50 homers ( his high is 38 , this season ) . But his stroke is deceptive . " In batting practice he 'll hit one , and you 'll think , O.K. , line drive to rightfield , " says Bagwell , " and it 'll end up four rows deep . He has tremendous power , and his bat head stays in the zone so long . " // Some suggest that Beltran now merits the Bonds treatment : lots of intentional walks . But as Houston rightfielder Lance Berkman says , " You do n't want to put him on because he can steal second , steal third . That 's another aspect to his game . " In fact , the switch-hitting Beltran may be the most complete player in the game . He stole 42 bases in 45 regular-season attempts ( and was successful in his first three postseason tries ) , and his career success rate -- 192 swipes in 215 attempts ( 89.3% )  - -  makes him the most difficult base stealer to catch in baseball history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bagwell says , " yet he 's running faster than anyone else . " At 27 , Beltran 's also a Gold Glove -- caliber centerfielder. // And he 's entering his prime at prime time . A free agent at season 's end , Beltran is expected to land a huge contract , and there 's been widespread speculation that the New York Yankees will open their vault in an attempt to sign him . Beltran will not discuss his contract situation , saying only that he wants to play for a contender . A petition addressed to Astros CEO Drayton McLane on the fan site AstrosDaily.com , urging him to resign Beltran , had drawn some 7,000 online signatures by Monday night . // Beltran had a co-star in the NLCS : St. Louis first baseman Albert Pujols , who was nearly matching him -- Hearns to Beltran 's Hagler -- blow for thudding blow . In nine postseason games through Monday , Pujols had gone 14 for 34 ( .412 ) with five home runs and 11 RBIs . Though he lacks Beltran 's foot speed , the 6 ' 3 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs are also line drive tracers. // Pujols comes to the plate with a routine : He digs in with his right foot on the back line of the batter 's box , taps his bat head on the bottom point of the plate , then carefully draws the bat back behind his ear and perpendicular to the ground . Pujols then raises and lowers his pointed right elbow slowly , three or four times , like a bellows , while holding his bat steady . Sixty percent of his weight rests on his back foot . Because he knows that hand speed is his biggest strength , he reminds himself to keep his hands back , waiting until he sees the pitcher 's release point before he strikes . The unfurling of his swing -- he stands pigeon-toed , pivoting on the ball of his left foot as the pitch comes in , before lashing his bat through the zone -- produces thunderous explosions . // Pujols , 24 , is a cerebral hitter who is very consistent -- only once this season did he go three straight games without a hit -- and is constantly making adjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never out of whack , " says Cardinals rightfielder Larry Walker . " There 's only a handful of people I 've seen like that who do n't get into slumps : Todd Helton , Tony Gwynn . What they have in common is that they 're always working on their swings . What people do n't see is Albert leaving the dugout after every at bat to go up to the clubhouse and look at tape , critiquing himself . He 's in the video room a lot , in the cage a lot . " Pujols lifts weights to strengthen his forearms in the off-season ; he maintains his sharpness by hitting off a ratty batting tee with a red base on which PUJOLS #5 is scrawled in black marker . His swing has no holes , and like Beltran , he has punished very good pitchers this postseason . Behind in the count 2 and 0 in the first inning of Game 1 , Astros righthander Brandon Backe threw a 93mph fastball high and away that he hoped Pujols might chase ; Pujols did , flashing his bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rightfield. // Pujols has even shown defensive mettle . In the sixth inning of Game 2 , with men on first and second and none out and the Cardinals clinging to a 4 -- 3 lead , Houston 's Eric Bruntlett squared to sacrifice . The righthanded-throwing Pujols charged the bunt , bare-handed it on a high hop five feet from the plate and threw a strike to Scott Rolen at third for the force-out . " I thought I had it , but then I heard him say , ' I got it , ' " says St. Louis reliever Kiko Calero . " He was too quick . " // Beltran 's and Pujols 's one-upmanship has become the thread running through the NLCS . In hopes of prolonging his success , Beltran , who insists he is not superstitious , has nonetheless developed a habit . His wife , Jessica , has been fixing him pregame breakfasts of two ham-and-cheese sandwiches and four slices of bacon . He has been eating them , driving to the ballpark and hitting home runs . He 'd relish nothing more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
