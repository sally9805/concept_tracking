<p> For Evan Kleiman , it all began more than 30 years ago - long before there was a real movement . As a teenager traveling in Italy , she fell in love with all things Italian - the culture , traditions , land , and food . Especially the food . The gentle rhythm of preparing and eating it . The slowness of it all . It was n't until 1998 , however , as the successful chef of Angeli Caffe , her own Italian restaurant in Los Angeles , that Ms. Kleiman learned of the Slow Food movement - an international group of some 60,000 members in 35 countries . Dedicated to slowing down the culinary pace of a fast-food-frenzied world and protecting the treasures of regional foods increasingly threatened by the homogenizing impact of agribusiness , Slow Food was started - where else ? - in Italy , in the mid-1980s as a response to - what else ? - the opening of the first McDonald 's restaurant at the foot of Rome 's famous Spanish Steps . <p> " It completely inspired me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food 's main events - the Salone di Gusto , a food fair held in Italy every two years , that features produce and products of small , artisan-type food producers from around the world . " There was a political message that 's sort of inherent in Slow Food that was completely appealing to me , " she says . " It 's about how we perceive our culture , the idea that if we want to protect our culture and our humanity , then we will protect our food . " Kleiman was won over immediately by Slow Food and happily agreed to start a Los Angeles " convivium , " a local chapter of the organization , which was just starting to spread to the United States . Today , Slow Food has a national office in New York , with some 4,000 members participating in 50 convivia across the country . In Los Angeles , Kleiman has shepherded some 150 members through a what's-what list of food experiences : everything from learning how to pick and cure olives , to a wine-and cheese-tasting tour , to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce they buy , to a pit-roasted wild-boar dinner held earlier this month on the grounds of an organic farm just outside Sequoia National Park , some 200 miles north of Los Angeles . In every case , the point is to put people in touch with food and the farmers who produce it - both to help build connections between consumers and regional producers and also to teach something of the traditions and culture that surround the foods . " I see it as a kind of food activism , " says Jordan Vannini , a member of the Los Angeles convivium who helped organize the wild boar dinner at Flora Bella Farm . " I 'm excited about the idea that there 's a counterforce out there to a society that has become dependent and interdependent on mass food production . " At the Flora Bella dinner , some 70 participants paid $ 85 each for a menu that included boar , Umbrian griddle bread , a traditional Italian pasta with boar ragout , a variety of vegetables grown on the farm - including a special sprouting broccoli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guests stayed overnight at nearby motels and returned for breakfast and a tour of Flora Bella , a certified organic farm . " I like the idea that they have an interest in small farmers and good food , and that they 're into preserving old varieties of produce , " says James Birch , who farms about 50 acres and sells much of his produce at farmers ' markets in Los Angeles , as well as to wholesalers and restaurants . " It 's a wonderful thing the slow-food movement is doing . " Founded by an Italian named Carlo Petrini , Slow Food has grown increasingly activist in the 15 years since it started . The group 's $ 60 membership fee includes a subscription to Slow , a lush quarterly magazine that is something of a National Geographic of food history and culture . In addition to the Salone di Gusto , which began in 1996 as a way to showcase the wares of traditional food artisans , Slow Food has started the honorary Ark of Taste as a way to bring attention to foods that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peach or the red abalone - and to try to help build a market for them . At last year 's Salone di Gusto , it also introduced special Slow Food awards - given to individuals making remarkable contributions to preserving traditional methods of food production . Last year 's winners - chosen by a jury of 400 Slow Food participants - included a woman in Mauritania whose work in camel breeding and camel milk has helped local nomads maintain their way of life , a Turkish man who has helped preserve traditional methods of honeymaking in his homeland , and a Mexican man who has helped maintain the traditional vanilla crop in the remote Chinantla forest region . The goal , says Patrick Martins , head of Slow Food 's national office , is to create " a little mini-economy , " through which Slow Food members help support small local producers by buying their products directly . Although no one is claiming that Slow Food 's efforts will turn back the global tide of agribusiness , many small farmers say they 've felt the group 's impact . David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally juicy but rare Sun Crest Peach , says that once his fruit was listed in the Ark of Taste , he started selling more of it . Prior to that listing , he says , he 'd been pulling out peach trees each year and planting more profitable grape vines , and was down to a crop of about 3,000 23-pound boxes each year . Now , that trend is reversed : He 's started planting more peach trees and sells 4,000 boxes a year , which , he says , is about all that he can handle . " It was n't like making the evening news , " says Mr. Masumoto , of being listed in the Ark . " But I sensed there were key communities of people around the country who pay attention to these kinds of things . We started selling more and more peaches . I know there 's a direct correlation . For me , it 's important . The Ark helps me tell the story of these peaches . It 's the best promotional tool ... I could do . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Masumoto , who wrote a book called " Epitaph for a Peach . " According to sociologist Jill Stein , who teaches at the University of California , Los Angeles , the Slow Food ethic dovetails neatly with a variety of social forces in today 's culture - everything from environmentalism to the increasing attention individuals are paying to health and quality of life . In addition , she says , Slow Food 's message is particularly appealing to individuals who are searching for a way out of the " McDonaldization " of everyday life . " We all experience this world where everything is bur- eaucratized and mechanized , " she says . " We all want to feel a sense of individuality , we do n't want to be just this nameless , faceless anonymous part of a mass . Slow Food is a way of exercising choice and freedom , and expressing our preferences , making an identity that 's separate from what 's imposed on us by the corporate commercial bureaucratic enterprises that are out there . " Kleiman agrees . She says that the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mid-80s - are eager for hands-on experiences with food and learning about the links between specific foods and culture . " One of the few ways you have of controlling your life is how you deal with feeding yourself , " she says . " In this culture , you can choose to eat processed food , you can choose to have takeout food every night for dinner , and as a restaurateur , I 'm happy a lot of people choose to do that . But you can also choose to learn how to cook , and you can choose to go to farmers ' markets to buy your food . I think that 's what appeals to people . " Even if you 're not a cooking fanatic , or one of those fortunate people who lives in a town where farmers ' markets flourish - or if you 're a working mother who 's just too pressed to put a home-cooked meal on the table every night - Slow Food devotees say there are still all kinds of ways to partake in the movement 's philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-course dinner , " says Mr. Martins . " It could be as simple as having an unusual variety of apple in the morning , as opposed to eating a generic Red Delicious . Slow Food is about respecting the rhythms of the table , about slowing down , about taking the time to sit down and taste the food .
