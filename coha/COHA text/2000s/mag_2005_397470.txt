Section : Technology VIDEOGAMES GABE NEWELL is the envy of giants in the videogame industry . He designs games  --  then lets fans make them even better . <p> A 60-INCH PLASMA SCREEN AT the offices of Valve Corp . roars to life with a heavy-metal soundtrack as a new videogame begins , and giant , gnarly aliens creep from the shadows of an ominous alleyway . The game , Alien Swarm , is the work of three creators who have piggybacked off of Valve 's big hit , Half-Life 2 , replacing the original game 's main characters with a cast of their own creation . <p> Alien Swarm is a " mod , " a modified add-on to the Valve title , and the rise of mods  --  letting your fans and even rivals freely tap into your game to redesign it  --  is a key reason behind the success of the privately held company . The Half-Life series has sold 15 million copies , and its first hot mod  --  Counter-Strike , a rapid-fire shoot-'em-up pitting online teams against each other  --  has racked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by Valve 's 50 programmers but by two rookies who had never even met  --  a high school senior in New Jersey and a college student in Vancouver , B.C. Valve bought the game and hired its two kid creators . <p> Now comes Alien Swarm , an unfinished mod being shown to Valve Chief Executive Gabe L. Newell by three programmers who make up the entirety of Black Cat Software . They nervously watch for his reaction , and Newell thrills them by leaning his ample 6-foot-4 frame toward them and asking , " So when are you guys going pro ? " <p> They decide that once Alien Swarm is finished , Valve may sell it for downloading on its Web site , steampowered.com , splitting the sales 50-50 with the three game designers . The Steam site has already begun promoting it . <p> " No one has created the Yahoo for games . That 's our opportunity , " says Newell , who plans to start selling music and minimovies on Steam next year . He is one of the most sought-after hitmakers in the $8.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company owned by Newell and a few employees , will do at least $70 million in revenue this year , double last year 's sales , with operating profit of $55 million . <p> Newell 's Web storefront , Steam , has 3 million members logging in every week to play games and get automatic upgrades . And while he started out selling in retail stores , in 2004 he became one of the first game developers to successfully sell direct to consumers online  --  a move retailers typically despise . Newell makes an operating margin of more than 80% on downloaded games ; titles sold at retail get a 36% margin . <p> Users who visit the Steam site get weekly marketing missives and can choose to let Valve scan their computers online to learn new insights . In the spring Valve discovered that its users with the most advanced graphics had tripled to 10% of all players . So it released a new , snazzier level of Half-Life aimed just at them . " Valve has a much better feel for who their customer is than the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America President Simon Jeffery . <p> Says Microsoft Xbox executive Gregory Canessa : " Valve is closest to figuring out how to make online sales work . " <p> Valve has done so by relying on the kindness of strangers : its own customers who are " modders . " Valve gives away the software tools that let even amateur programmers make mods , because you must buy a copy of Half-Life to be able to create your own mod or play someone else 's . <p> Newell sells 15 mod versions and knows of 500 mods floating around in cyberspace , but there could be thousands . Half-Life pits a geeky scientist ( you ) against corrupt government agents and lethal aliens at a top-secret government site . The Counter-Strike mod transforms this into a multiplayer game of terrorists versus counterterrorists . Day of Defeat applies the premise to World War II . Half-Life Rally has cars racing through the original site ( and no killing ) . Vampire Slayer is self-explanatory . <p> " We let our community of players make up the rules , " Newell says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online himself and shares half the sales with the modders . If a modder wants to sell it on his own , he must pay Valve a $200,000 licensing fee , plus royalties , in exchange for using Half-Life 's development engine . <p> Newell , 43 , learned from his first employer , Bill Gates , that success in software comes from getting outside developers to write programs that sell more copies of your own . Newell was the 271st employee at Microsoft and , like Gates , is a Harvard dropout . ( Steve Ballmer , then Microsoft 's head of sales , talked him into leaving college . ) Newell spent 13 years in Redmond as the lead developer of the first three versions of Windows . <p> He was brilliant and wildly productive . " He was doing 30 products a year , " says former colleague Alex St. John , now chief executive of WildTangent , a Web shop selling smaller games . <p> Newell quit Microsoft in 1996 and cashed in his stock options to launch Valve that year . He has put a daunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying out a cofounder and eschewing venture capital backing . He was inspired by the story of Id Software , producers of Doom and Quake , two massive PC hits that let amateur designers modify the games ' code to change details and scenery . One popular mod inserted Homer Simpson as the main shooter . <p> So Newell licensed some Quake code from Id to create Half-Life , which debuted in 1998 and sold 2.5 million copies at retail in its first year . And there sales would have stalled , but modding extends a game 's life and sparks further sales . Newell hired the two young Australian programmers who had created the most popular Quake mod , Team Fortress , and bought the rights to their game . They added more powerful graphics tools for Half-Life modders . <p> A year later the community produced its first hit : Counter-Strike . Newell bought it for a pittance in 2000 and hired its two creators ( the high school kid in New Jersey and the college kid in Vancouver ) . Half-Life itself did n't reach its sales peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months . <p> Flush with success , Newell embarked on a five-year , $40 million effort to make Half-Life 2 ( similar setting , better tools ) . Introduced in 2004 , it has sold 4 million copies and inspired 100 new mods . Alien Swarm may be the first mod Valve itself will sell for Half-Life 2 . Mods now provide 20% of Valve 's total revenue and someday could account for up to 50% of sales . <p> It is the upside , Newell says , of letting customers take total control , and the practice should n't be limited to videogames : " George Lucas should have distributed the ' source code ' to Star Wars . Millions of fans would create their own movies and stories . Most of them would be terrible , but a few would be genius .

Eight years ago Munoz , 45 , left his job at a small investment banking firm to launch the Cyberathlete Professional League , or CPL . Id Software 's Quake was then one of the only multiplayer games around . CPL now hosts a dozen events a year where individual players or teams face off . Counter-Strike is one of the most popular CPL tournament games . Its world finals are expected to draw 32 of the top players and 500 fans to New York City in November . <p> The top teams make enough to hire coach/managers .

CPL 's Munoz signed up MTV to broadcast his Winter Championships this November .
