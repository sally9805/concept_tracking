" Titus " I have been in love with Titus Oates for quite a while now -- which is ridiculous , since he 's been dead for ninety years . But look at it this way . In ninety years I 'll be dead , too , and then the age difference wo n't matter . Besides , he is n't dead inside my head . We talk about all kinds of things . From whether hair color can change spontaneously to whether friends are better than family , and the best age for marrying : 14 or 125 . Generally speaking , he knows more than I do , but on that particular subject we are even . He was n't married -- at least , he was n't when he died , which must have substantially cut down his chances . Uncle Victor says I should n't marry at all . Uncle Victor knows about these things and he says that " marriage is a bourgeois relic of Victorian sentimentality . " That suits me . No one would match up to Titus . And we have a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's done so much for us -- for Mum and me , I mean . And anyway , he 's just so clever . Uncle Victor knows a fantastic amount . He knows at what temperature glass turns to liquid , and where Communism went wrong and how the Clifton Suspension Bridge was built and just what the Government ought to be doing ; you ca n't fault him . He 's read books about everything : history , geography , politics , astrology , animals . . . the Fount of AllKnowledge , Dad used to call him . I would get stuck doing my homework , and Dad would say , " Ask the Fount of All Knowledge . " And I 'd telephone Victor and he would tell me . Quite often he knew more than the teachers , so they 'd think I 'd got my homework wrong , but as Victor says , " What teachers do n't understand is that the body of learning is still growing . They reckon it stopped the day they came out of college . That , or they 're plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true that none of my teachers knows much about Antarctica . When Dad and Victor and I went to Iceland , one of the teachers had been , too , and knew all about Dettifoss and the hot springs and people having stinking saunas in their backyards . But none of the teachers at school has been to Antarctica . Some of them know about Scott of the Antarctic going to the South Pole and not coming back . But they mostly mean John Mills in the movie . I do n't . In the general way of things , I do n't know much about anything . Uncle Victor says I 'm " the victim of a shoddy education system . " But I do know about the Polar Regions . The bookshelves over my bed are full of books about the North and South Poles . Icebound almost . A glacial cliff face teetering over my bed . I remember , the night after Dad had been rushed into the hospital , one of the shelves sheared off and crashed down on me . I woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing off the bed frame , slapping flat on the floor . I looked at the hole in the wall and the brackets on the pillow and I did n't know what to do . About the shelf . About anything . So I went back to sleep , and dreamed that I was sailing toward the Ross Ice Shelf , and that crags were splitting off its face , plunging down , massive as seagoing liners foundering . Come to think of it , Uncle Victor gave me most of my ice books . Every birthday and Christmas . Books about The Ice and the North Pole ; about Shackleton and Scott , Laurence Gould and Vivian Fuchs , Nansen and Barents , Franklin and Peary ; about penguins and polar bears , whales and seals and boreales . . . About Captain Lawrence Oates -- the one they called " Titus . " Uncle Victor understands how the whole idea creeps up on you like pack ice -- pressing in and pressing against your head , then crushing the hull and tumbling inside . . . . If we ever did a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Erebus in mid-summer , I could , I could shine ! Except that I do n't think I would choose to . It 's all bound up with Titus , and I know better than to mention Titus at school . I do now , anyway . I made that mistake once . I wo n't do it again . " Symone has a pretend friend ! Symone has a pretend friend ! " It was the conversation about kissing -- or snogging , as they invariably call it . Like the ant nest in the larder : You think you 've done everything to be rid of it -- that it ca n't possibly come back again -- but there it is : " How many boys have you snogged ? " There is no right answer . You say " none " and you 're sad and frigid or they know someone whose brother would be willing to snog you for cash . You refuse to answer and you are sadder still -- or hiding something , or prefer girls , or . . . It 's not that they care ; they only want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying the word . It makes them feel as if they are wearing red underwear . But on and on they go : " How many boys , Sym ? How many boys have you snogged ? " Why is it that all the words to do with sex are ugly ? Words to do with love are n't . No wonder Titus thought women were a nuisance . No wonder he died without ever . . . getting mixed up with all that . Anyway , I said that I could do without it . ( At least that 's what I tried to say . I do n't explain things very well out loud . ) I tried to say that I was happy to stick with imagining for the time being , thanks all the same . Later , maybe . If I ever met anyone who could compare with Titus . . . And after that I was the mad girl -- sad , frigid , and mad , all three -- the retard who had an imaginary friend : " Like little kids do , oo-hoo . Like little kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
