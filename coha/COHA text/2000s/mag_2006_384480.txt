. Q My toddler sucks her thumb . Is it true that there 's no harm in it , as long as she stops before her adult teeth come in ? Officially , yes . According to the American Dental Association , her thumb sucking likely wo n't cause dental problems if she quits before she gets her permanent teeth . They can start coming in around age 6 , so you 've got time . That said , thumb sucking 's not an easy habit to break , so getting started earlier rather than later is a good idea . First , simply talk to her . Explain that big girls do n't suck their thumbs and that doing it will ruin her pretty teeth . You might put a bandage on her thumb to remind her . It 's also safe to paint her thumb with lemon juice or one of those bitter solutions sold at pharmacies for this purpose . Some kids suck their thumbs in their sleep ; if yours does , try putting a sock or mitten on her hand at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth , make a big deal out of it . It 's fine to offer her a small reward , too . Whatever you do , make it clear that you 're not punishing her . If the process really upsets her , stop for a while . Same goes if there 's anything stressful happening in her life ( starting a new preschool , a new baby at home , etc . ) . If none of this works , your dentist can fit her for a mouthpiece that makes thumb sucking physically impossible . But before you resort to this measure , remember  --  there 's still time . Babies with breasts Q I 've noticed that my 18-month-old daughter already seems to be growing a breast on one side ! Is something wrong ? I 've seen this many times in my practice . Your daughter probably has something called benign premature thelarche  --  medicalese for early breast development that 's nothing to worry about . In most cases , it 's thought that small amounts of extra hormones cause breast tissue to grow for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by itself or remains as a small nubbin until puberty , when it develops into a normal-size breast . There are some serious causes of breast tissue in toddlers ( who do n't usually have any at all ) , though , so do have your doctor check it out . A sudden jump up a height percentile or two can mean a significant hormonal problem . So can signs of puberty , such as pubic or underarm hair . If you notice either , or if your daughter 's breast seems to be growing rapidly , call the doctor right away . Lawn-mower safety Q My husband insists there 's nothing wrong with letting our son play outside while he mows the grass , but I disagree . Who 's right ? You are . Every year , more than 9,000 children are injured in accidents related to lawn mowers . Kids can be hurt by the mower blades themselves or by rocks , sticks , stray toys , or other things thrown from the blades . These injuries can be severe ( we 'll leave the worst-case scenarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 85 decibels can cause hearing loss . Power lawn mowers come in at about 90 decibels . That 's why the American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children be indoors or at a " safe distance " whenever lawns are mowed . The only problem with a safe distance is that kids , especially small ones , have a way of moving from a safe place to an unsafe one quite quickly . The din of a lawn mower can make it even harder to keep track of them . So in my family , it 's a strict rule that whenever my husband is mowing the lawn , the kids all stay inside the house . And keep in mind that children should never , ever , be allowed to sit on a riding lawn mower , even if they 're accompanied by a parent .
