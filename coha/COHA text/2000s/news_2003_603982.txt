<p> DETROIT  --  General Motors has figured out what to do with the concept of four-wheel steering : Put it on big trucks so they 're easier to handle in tight spaces . <p> GM gave its 2002 GMC Sierra Denali pickup ( Test Drive , Jan. 18 , 2002 ) one-year exclusive use of the four-wheel steering ( 4ws ) that GM calls Quadrasteer . Time 's up and Q-steer 's now available on other GMCs and on Chevrolet trucks . <p> Quadrasteer uses an electric steering motor in back . It turns the rear wheels opposite the fronts at low speed , in the same direction at higher speed . <p> Delphi , which makes Q-steer , is free to sell the product to GM rivals beginning with ' 04 models . Other suppliers have 4ws systems in the wings , too . It works so well , it 's a no-brainer on big trucks  --  or would be if not for these hurdles : <p> * It 's really expensive . It 's a $ 4,495 option on the Chevrolet Suburban and similar GMC Yukon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving a $ 2,000 " introductory " discount for the whole ' 03 model year . <p> * It 's big . Quadrasteer is wide so the rear tires have room to turn up to 10 degrees ( 12 degrees on pickups ) without smacking the springs . That makes the trucks more than 80 inches wide , requiring clearance lights on the fenders and even on the roof . So right off , you have to be OK with the commercial look on your truck . The long SUVs  --  Yukon XL and Chevy Suburban  --  wear the girth much better than stubbier pickups do . <p> * It requires leaf springs . Quadrasteer is not yet developed to mate with coil springs , the heart of smoother-riding suspensions found on cars and standard-duty SUVs . All big pickups have leaf springs , so they are candidates for Q-steer . But to get 4ws in a full-size SUV , you have to step up to heavier-duty models , often called three-quarter-tons . GM identifies those as 2500-series trucks . <p> The test truck was a 2500-series , four-wheel drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breathtaking $ 54,000 and included DVD entertainment for rear riders , leather everywhere , the 6-liter V-8 not available in the standard-duty , automatic four-wheel drive and an array of luxury features . But , c'm on , 54 grand for a Chevy truck ? A Corvette 's cheaper . <p> Or you could get the new-for- ' 03 Cadillac Escalade ESV  --  essentially a fancy Suburban . But you would n't get Q-steer or the heavier-duty towing capabilities . <p> Here 's what stands out from a 500-mile-plus drive from Virginia to here plus local errands and commuting : <p> * Steering . The whole point , of course , and it 's wonderful , a godsend in daily driving . It cuts the turning-circle diameter on the 4x4 Suburban to 35 feet from 44.3 ; on the 4x2 to 35.2 from 44.5 . That means the Quadrasteer Suburban can turn as tightly as the four-door Chevy Tracker , a baby SUV . The big Chevy zips into parking slots in a single , graceful maneuver without all the backing and forthing that a non-4ws version would require . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter and precise on GM 's three-quarter-ton trucks than on the half-ton standard-duties . It 's worth considering the 2500 series just for that . <p> On the snowiest portions of the highway drive , the Suburban felt slightly twitchy with Q-steer on , more stable with it switched off . GM says it should n't be so . <p> * Comfort . Better on the supposedly rough-duty trucks than the standard models . Seats are easier on the back and rump . <p> Exception : The rear of the test truck slammed hard into potholes , with little apparent damping from the shock absorbers . Q-steer comes with GM 's Autoride , which automatically firms up the suspension in demanding situations . It could have been overreacting , or the shocks might simply be tuned wrong for potholes . <p> Some owners report violent bucking from the rear . GM says that happens mainly in California and parts of Nevada where pavement sections are abnormally short to lessen road damage in an earthquake . <p> * Power . The 6-liter V-8 is a nice piece of work . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it runs . Flooring the gas results in unpleasant noises , though there 's a nice burble from the exhaust at idle . <p> * Entertainment . A DVD system is a blessing traveling with kids , and in the Suburban it is simple enough that even a parent can operate it . Fold down the screen from the ceiling pod , pop in the disc , hit play and there you have it . The kids have wireless headphones , leaving the grownups free to listen to music or political screeds on the radio . <p> High-end Bose stereo makes listening a nice activity . <p> * Handiness . There are more than three dozen SUVs on the market , and the hefty Suburban ranks a remarkable No. 6 in sales despite its imposing size , poor fuel economy and relatively high price . If you add sales of the nearly identical GMC Yukon XL , the combined model rises to fourth-best in sales . <p> The attraction could be because you do n't have to fold the third-row seats to get generous cargo space , and you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarding the rush-hour subway . <p> However , to really maximize load space , you have to remove the third row of seats . You should be able to fold them out of the way without the labor of removing them . <p> Four-wheel steering on an already popular SUV should help acquaint soccer parents and other regular folks with Q-steer . GM says it knows of at least three other suppliers with 4ws nearly ready , so it could quickly become a common option . That increased competition will make it cheaper . <p> But it also needs to be narrower , to avoid the clearance-light requirement , and adaptable to coil springs so the most-popular SUVs can offer it . <p> Let 's hope all that happens fast , because four-wheel steering , as pioneered on big trucks by GM , is one of the niftiest accessories you can buy . <p> 2003 Suburban 2500 Quadrasteer <p> * What is it ? Heavy-duty version of a full-size , four-door , eight-passenger sport-utility vehicle , equipped with optional four-wheel steering ( 4ws ) , available with two-wheel ( 4x2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas . <p> * How soon ? On sale now . <p> * How much ? Base Suburban 2500 series ( three-quarter ton ) 4x2 starts at $ 38,295 , including $ 790 destination charge . 4x4 version starts at $ 41,795 . Quadrasteer 4ws option adds $ 4,495 , but carries $ 2,000 discount for ' 03 models . <p> * What 's the powertrain ? 6-liter V-8 rated 320 horsepower at 5,000 rpm , 360 pounds-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm ; 4L80E heavy-duty , four-speed automatic transmission . <p> * What 's the rest ? Air conditioning ; power steering , brakes , windows , locks , mirrors , driver 's seat ; remote-control locks ; cruise control ; AM/FM/CD/cassette stereo ; tilt-adjustable steering column ; leather-covered steering wheel ; outside mirror and rear-window defrosters ; auto-dimming inside rearview mirror ; fog lights ; roof rack ; tow hooks ; skid plates ; heavy-duty trailer-towing suspension ; LT245/75R-16 all-season tires on aluminum alloy wheels ; full-size spare . <p> * How big ? Definitely full-size . Suburban 2500 is 219.3 inches long , 76.4 inches tall ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's listed as 5,520 ( 4x2 ) or 5,796 ( 4x4 ) pounds . <p> Maximum cargo space is listed as 64.4 cubic feet behind the third row , and a maximum 131.6 cubic feet behind the front row . Rated to carry 1,430 pounds ( 4x2 ) or 1,288 pounds ( 4x4 ) of people and cargo . Tows up to 12,000 pounds . <p> * How thirsty ? Heavy-duty trucks are n't required to post fuel-economy estimates . Based on results in the test truck , figure about 12 miles per gallon in town with a light foot , 16 mpg on the highway  --  dropping alarmingly fast if you 're a lead foot . Regular fuel is specified . <p> * Overall : Highly maneuverable , which is the point of Quadrasteer . Even with the discount , it 's still too expensive . <p>  --  <p> More online <p> * Chat online with James R. Healey at 2 p.m .
