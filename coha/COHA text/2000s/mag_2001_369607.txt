In eight years as President , Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton each issued roughly 400 pardons . But in their final days , just 10 trickled out of Reagan 's White House , while 177 flooded out of Clinton 's . And Marc Rich 's pardon is n't the only one that appalled federal prosecutors . While most of the 177 were for minor drug and fraud offenses , roughly a third raise serious questions . A TIME analysis of the pardon fever  --  the symptoms included well-connected lawyers and pols pulling strings , bypassing the Justice Department and sending petitions directly to the White House , often at the last minute  --  turned up these eye-popping remissions of sin . <P> The Big Apple Gang <P> U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White is furious at Clinton for several New York cases . In 1993 and ' 94 , Harvey Weinig , 53 , helped launder at least $19 million for the Cali drug cartel . Justice strongly opposed his petition , but Clinton commuted Weinig 's 11-year sentence  --  cutting it in half  --  and now he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents showing Weinig was also involved in a kidnapping plot . Former White House aide David Dreyer , a relative of Weinig 's , told TIME he asked Clinton chief of staff John Podesta and former White House counsel Beth Nolan for the commutation " as an act of mercy . " <P> Edward Downe Jr. , a publishing and financial executive , pleaded guilty to insider trading in 1993 . He was sentenced to three years ' probation , and paid $11 million in fines . Downe has contributed $21,500 to Democrats since 1991 , including $1,000 to Hillary Clinton 's Senate campaign . His application went straight to Clinton , and White 's office learned about it only the night before his pardon . <P> William Fugazy , a friend of Mario Cuomo 's , was known as the limo king of New York until he landed in bankruptcy court in 1997 . Convicted of hiding $75 million from creditors , he was sentenced to two years ' probation . Justice rejected his petition last year because guidelines require applicants to wait for five years after conviction . Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also upset about the commutation Clinton gave to Susan Rosenberg , who was convicted in 1984 of carrying explosives and weapons for the Weather Underground . One of Rosenberg 's guns was bought with fake ID by Linda Sue Evans , who also took part in the 1983 bombing of an empty room at the U.S. Capitol to protest the invasion of Grenada . Clinton 's order freed both from prison . <P> The Protester <P> During a 1970 protest at St. Louis University , Howard Mechanic lobbed a cherry bomb at police and firefighters . He fled to Arizona and began a new life as a businessman . But his secret came out when he ran for the Scottsdale city council last year , and he went to federal prison . His successful pardon application drew support from several Senators . But in Clinton 's haste to process so many pleas , he signed a pardon letter that contained a typo and ended up clearing Mechanic of the wrong charge . <P> Connections Pay                 @ @ @ @
