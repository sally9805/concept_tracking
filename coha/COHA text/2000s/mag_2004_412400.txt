FORTUNE // It 's strange to think that I can still remember the smell after all this time . The year was 1978 , not long after my 15th birthday , and I 'd sneaked into my brother 's bedroom . There , on a wall of shelves that stretched to the ceiling , were the heaviest books we had in our house-24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica . The maroon spines were coated in a film of dust , I remember . The pages smelled as if a musty old pillow had been covered in mint . I carefully pulled out the volume marked HALICARNASSUS TO IMMINGHAM and turned to the entry for Hodgkin 's disease . It took forever to read the half-dozen paragraphs , the weighty book spread open on my lap like a Bible . There was talk of a mysterious " lymphatic system , " of " granulomas " and " gamma rays , " as though this disease-the one the doctor had just told me I had-was something out of science fiction . But the last line I understood all too well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would die within five years . As it turns out , I did not die from Hodgkin 's , though the cancer had already spread from my neck to my lungs and spleen . I lost my spleen to surgery and most of my hair to chemotherapy and radiation . But I was lucky enough to get into a clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute that was testing a new combination therapy-four toxic chemicals , together called MOPP , plus those invisible gamma rays , which flowed from an enormous cobalt 60 machine three stories below ground . The nurses who stuck needles in my arm were so kind I fell in love with them . The brilliant doctor who tattooed the borders of an imaginary box on my chest , then zapped me with radiation for four weeks , had warm pudgy hands and a comic look of inspiration , as though he 'd thought of something funny just before entering the exam room . The American taxpayer even footed the bill . Most of all , of course , I was lucky to survive . So it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Why have we made so little progress in the War on Cancer ? The question may come as a shock to anyone who has witnessed a loved one survive the dread diseaseor marveled at Lance Armstrong powering to his fifth Tour de France victory after beating back testicular cancer , or received a fundraising letter saying that a cure is within our grasp . Most recently , with media reports celebrating such revolutionary cancer medicines as Gleevec , Herceptin , Iressa , Erbitux , and the justapproved Avastin , the cure has seemed closer than ever . But it 's not . Hope and optimism , so essential to this fight , have masked some very real systemic problems that have made this complex , elusive , relentless foe even harder to defeat . The result is that while there have been substantial achievements since the crusade began with the National Cancer Act in 1971 , we are far from winning the war . So far away , in fact , that it looks like losing . Just count the bodies on the battlefield . In 2004 , cancer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and countrymen . More Americans will die of cancer in the next 14 months than have perished in every war the nation has ever fought ... combined . Even as research and treatment efforts have intensified over the past three decades and funding has soared dramatically , the annual death toll has risen 73%-over one and a half times as fast as the growth of the U.S. population . Within the next decade , cancer is likely to replace heart disease as the leading cause of U.S. deaths , according to forecasts by the NCI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is already the biggest killer of those under 75 . Among those ages 45 to 64 , cancer is responsible for more deaths than the next three causes ( heart disease , accidents , and stroke ) put together . It is also the leading disease killer of children , thirtysomethings-and everyone in between . Researchers point out that people live a lot longer than they used to , and since cancer becomes more prevalent with age , it 's unfair to look just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate the mortality rate , they adjust it to compare cancer fatalities by age group over time . But even using this analysis ( in which the proportion of elderly is dialed back to what it was during the Nixon administration ) , the percentage of Americans dying from cancer is about the same as in 1970 ... and in 1950 . The figures are all the more jarring when compared with those for heart disease and stroke-other ailments that strike mostly older Americans . Age-adjusted death rates for those diseases have been slashed by an extraordinary 59% and 69% , respectively , during the same half-century . Researchers also say more people are surviving longer with cancer than ever . Yet here , too , the complete picture is more disappointing . Survival gains for the more common forms of cancer are measured in additional months of life , not years . The few dramatic increases in cure rates and patient longevity have come in a handful of less common malignancies-including Hodgkin 's , some leukemias , carcinomas of the thyroid and testes , and most childhood cancers . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early days of the War on Cancer . ) Thirty-three years ago , fully half of cancer patients survived five years or more after diagnosis . The figure has crept up to about 63% today . Yet very little of this modest gain is the result of exciting new compounds discovered by the NCI labs or the big cancer research centers-where nearly all the public 's money goes . Instead , simple behavioral changes such as quitting smoking have helped lower the incidence of deadly lung cancer . More important , with the help of breast self-exams and mammography , PSA tests for prostate cancer , and other testing , we 're catching more tumors earlier . Ruth Etzioni , a biostatistician at Seattle 's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , points out that when you break down the Big Four cancers ( lung , colon and rectal , breast , and prostate ) by stage-that is , how far the malignant cells have spread-long-term survival for advanced cancer has barely budged since the 1970s ( see charts opposite ) . And the new cases keep coming . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has skyrocketed since the War on Cancer began . This year an additional 1.4 million Americans will have that most frightening of conversations with their doctor . One in two men and one in three women will get the disease during their lifetime . As a veteran Dana-Farber researcher sums up , " It is as if one World Trade Center tower were collapsing on our society every single day . " So why are n't we winning this decades-old war on terror-and what can we do now to turn it around ? That was the question I asked dozens of researchers , physicians , and epidemiologists at leading cancer hospitals around the country ; pharmacologists , biologists , and geneticists at drug companies and research centers ; officials at the FDA , NCI , and NIH ; fundraisers , activists , and patients . During three months of interviews in Houston , Boston , New York , San Francisco , Washington , D.C. , and other cancer hubs , I met many of the smartest and most deeply committed people I 've ever known . The great majority , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're making , believing that the grim statistics belie the wealth of knowledge we 've gained-knowledge , they say , that will someday lead to viable treatments for the 100-plus diseases we group as cancer . Most felt , despite their often profound misgivings about the way research is done , that we 're on the right path . Yet virtually all these experts offered testimony that , when taken together , describes a dysfunctional " cancer culture " -a groupthink that pushes tens of thousands of physicians and scientists toward the goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs ; that fosters isolated ( and redundant ) problem solving instead of cooperation ; and rewards academic achievement and publication over all else . At each step along the way from basic science to patient bedside , investigators rely on models that are consistently lousy at predicting success-to the point where hundreds of cancer drugs are thrust into the pipeline , and many are approved by the FDA , even though their proven " activity " has little to do with curing cancer . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman of Intel and a prostate-cancer survivor , who for years has tried to shake this cultural mindset as a member of several cancer advisory groups . " Everybody plays his individual part to perfection , everybody does what 's right by his own life , and the total just does n't work . " Tragedy , unfortunately , is the perfect word for it . Heroic figures battling forces greater than themselves . Needless death and destruction . But unlike Greek tragedy , where the Fates predetermine the outcome , the nation 's cancer crusade did n't have to play out this way . And it does n't have to stay this way . " A VERY TOUGH SET OF PROBLEMS " NUCLEAR FISSION WAS A MERE eight months old when the Panzers rolled into Poland in September 1939 , beginning the Second World War . Niels Bohr had announced the discovery at a conference on theoretical physics at George Washington University . Three years later the crash program to build an atomic device from a uranium isotope began in earnest . And within three years of that- Aug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NASA came into existence on Oct. 1 , 1958 . Eleven years later , two men were dancing on the moon . Sequencing the entire human genome took just 18 years from the time the idea was born at a small gathering of scientists in Santa Cruz , Calif . Go back as far as Watson and Crick , to the discovery of the structure of DNA , and the feat was still achieved in a mere half-century . Cancer researchers hate such comparisons . Good science , say many , ca n't be managed . ( Well , sure , maybe easy stuff like nuclear physics , rocket science , and genetics-but not cancer . ) And to be sure , cancer is a challenge like no other . The reason is that this killer has a truly uncanny ability to change its identity . " The hallmark of a cancer cell is its genetic instability , " says Isaiah " Josh " Fidler , professor and chair of the department of cancer biology at Houston 's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center . The cell 's DNA is not fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell passes on pristine copies of its three-billion-letter code to every next-generation cell . But when a cancer cell divides , it may pass along to its daughters an altered copy of its DNA instructions-and even the slightest change can have giant effects on cell behavior . The consequence , says Fidler , is that while cancer is thought to begin with a single cell that has mutated , the tumors eventually formed are made up of countless cellular cousins , with a variety of quirky traits , living side by side . " That heterogeneity of tumors is the major , major obstacle to easy therapy , " he says . Harold Varmus , president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City , agrees . " I just think this is a very tough set of problems , " says Varmus , who has seen those problems from more angles than just about anybody . He shared a Nobel Prize for discovering the first oncogene ( a normal gene that when mutated can cause cancer ) in 1976 . That crucial finding , five years into the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutated genes . Later Varmus served as NIH director under Bill Clinton , presiding over a period of huge funding increases . " Time always looks shorter in retrospect , " he says . " I think , hey , in 30 years mankind went from being almost completely ignorant about how cancer arises to being pretty damn knowledgeable . " Yet all that knowledge has come at a price . And there 's a strong argument to be made that maybe that price has been too high . President Nixon devoted exactly 100 words of his 1971 State of the Union speech to proposing " an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer . " The word " war " was never mentioned in the text , yet one would flare up in the months that followed-a lobbying war over how much centralized control the proposed national cancer authority would exert . Between the speech and the signing of the National Cancer Act that December , there was a " battle line between " creative research " and " structured research , " " as a news . report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical societies , the medical schools , the then-Big Three cancer hospitals ( Memorial Sloan-Kettering , M.D. Anderson , and Roswell Park in Buffalo ) said yes to federal money but wanted very little direction and only loose coordination from Uncle Sam . On the other side was Sidney Farber , the Boston physician known as the godfather of cancer research . He wanted public backing for a massive , coordinated assault . " We can not wait for full understanding ; the 325,000 patients with cancer who are going to die this year can not wait ; nor is it necessary , in order to make great progress in the cure of cancer , for us to have the full solution of all the problems of basic research , " Farber testified in congressional hearings that fall . " The history of medicine is replete with examples of cures obtained years , decades , and even centuries before the mechanism of action was understood for these cures-from vaccination , to digitalis , to aspirin . " Farber lost . Today the cancer effort is utterly fragmented-so much so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for all this research is coming from . But let 's try anyway . We begin with the NCI budget . Set by Congress , this year 's outlay for fighting cancer is $4.74 billion . Critics have complained that is a mere 3.3% over last year 's budget , but Uncle Sam gives prodigiously in other ways too-a fact few seem to realize . The NIH , technically the NCI 's parent , will provide an additional $909 million this year for cancer research through the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and other little-noticed grant mechanisms . The Department of Veterans Affairs will likely spend just over the $457 million it spent in 2003 for research and prevention programs . The CDC will chip in around $314 million for outreach and education . Even the Pentagon pays for cancer research-offering $249 million this year for nearly 500 peerreviewed grants to study breast , prostate , and ovarian cancer . Now throw state treasuries into the mix-governors signed 89 cancer-related appropriations from 1997 to 2003-plus the fundraising muscle of cancer charities , cancer centers , and research hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous donors , based on recent tax forms . And finally , that huge spender Big Pharma . The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates that drug companies will devote about $7.4 billion , or roughly a quarter of their annual R &D; spending , to products for cancer and metabolic and endocrine diseases . When you add it all up , Americans have spent , through taxes , donations , and private R &D,; close to $200 billion , in inflation-adjusted dollars , since 1971 . What has that national investment netted so far ? Without question , the money has bought us an enormous amount of knowledge , just as Varmus says . Researchers have mapped the human cell 's intricate inner circuitry in extraordinary detail , identifying dozens of molecular chains of communication , or " signaling pathways , " among various proteins , phosphates , and lipids made by the body . In short , scientists now know ( or think they know ) nearly all the biochemical steps that a healthy cell uses to multiply , to shut down its growth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as many of the genes that encode for these processes . What 's more , by extension , they know how these same gene-induced mechanisms go haywire in a cancer cell . According to PubMed , the NCI 's online database , the cancer research community has published 1.56 million papers-that 's right : 1.56 million ! - largely on this circuitry and its related genes in hundreds of journals over the years . Many of the findings are shared at the 100-plus international congresses , symposiums , and conventions held each year . Yet somehow , along the way , something important has gotten lost . The search for knowledge has become an end unto itself rather than the means to an end . And the research has become increasingly narrow , so much so that physician-scientists who want to think systemically about cancer or the organism as a whole-or who might have completely new approaches-often ca n't get funding . Take , for instance , the NCI 's chief funding mechanism , something called an RO1 grant . The grants are generous , averaging $338,000 apiece in 2003 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : One in three applications is accepted . But the money goes almost entirely to researchers who focus on very specific genetic or molecular mechanisms within the cancer cell or other tissue . The narrower the research niche , it sometimes seems , the greater the rewards the researcher is likely to attain . " The incentives are not aligned with the goals , " says Leonard Zwelling , vice president for research administration at M.D. Anderson , voicing the feeling of many . " If the goal is to cure cancer , you do n't incentivize people to have little publications . " Jean-Pierre Issa , a colleague of Zwelling 's who studies leukemias , is equally frustrated by the community 's mindset . Still , he admits , the system 's lure is powerful . " You get a paper where you change one gene ever so slightly and you have a drastic effect of cancer in the mouse , and that paper gets published in Science or Nature , and in your best journals . That makes your reputation . Then you start getting grants based on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 80% of it is mice or drosophila fruit flies or nematodes worms . When do you get human studies in there ? " Indeed , the cancer community has published an extraordinary 150,855 experimental studies on mice , according to a search of the PubMed database . Guess how many of them have led to treatments for cancer ? Very , very few . In fact , if you want to understand where the War on Cancer has gone wrong , the mouse is a pretty good place to start . THE MODELS OF CANCER STINK OUTSIDE ERIC LANDER 'S OFFICE is a narrow , six-foot-high poster . It is an org chart of sorts , a taxonomy , with black lines connecting animal species . The poster 's lessons feel almost biblical-it shows , for example , that the zebrafish has much in common with the chicken ; that hedgehog and shrew are practically kissing cousins ; and that while a human might look more like a macaque than a platypus or a mouse , it ai n't that big of a leap , really . The connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same wondrous code of life . And therein lie both the temptation and the frustration inherent in cancer research today . Certain mutated genes cause cells to proliferate uncontrollably , to spread to new tissues where they do n't belong , and to refuse to end their lives when they should . That 's cancer . So research , as we 've said , now revolves around finding first , the molecular mechanisms to which these mutated genes give rise , and second , drugs that can stop them . The strategy sounds obvious-and nobody makes it sound more so than Lander , the charismatic founding director of the Whitehead Institute 's Center for Genome Research in Cambridge , Mass. , and a leader of the Human Genome Project . The " Prince of Nucleotides , " as FORTUNE once called him , sketches the biological route to cancer cures as if he were directing you to the nearest Starbucks : " There are only , pick a number , say , 30,000 genes . They do only a finite number of things . There are only a finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number ; when I say finite , I do n't mean to trivialize it . There may be 100 mechanisms that cancers are using , but 100 is only 100 . " So , he continues , we need to orchestrate an attack that isolates these mechanisms by knocking out cancer-promoting genes one by one in mice , then test drugs that kill the mutant cells . " These are doable experiments , " he says . " Cancers by virtue of having mutations also acquire Achilles ' heels . Rational cancer therapies are about finding the Achilles ' heel associated with each new mutation in a cancer . " The principle is , in all likelihood , dead-on . The process itself , on the other hand , has one heck of an Achilles ' heel . And that takes us back to the six-foot poster showing the taxonomy of genomes . A mouse gene may be very similar to a human gene , but the rest of the mouse is very different . The fact that so many cancer researchers seem to forget or ignore this observation when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irks Robert Weinberg . A professor of biology at MIT and winner of the National Medal of Science for his discovery of both the first human oncogene and the first tumor-suppressor gene , Weinberg is as no-nonsense as Lander is avuncular . Small and mustachioed , with Hobbit-like fingers , he plops into a brown leather La-Z-Boy that is somehow wedged into the middle of his cramped office , and launches into a lecture : " One of the most frequently used experimental models of human cancer is to take human cancer cells that are grown in a petri dish , put them in a mouse-in an immunocompromised mouse-allow them to form a tumor , and then expose the resulting xenograft to different kinds of drugs that might be useful in treating people . These are called preclinical models , " Weinberg explains . " And it 's been well known for more than a decade , maybe two decades , that many of these preclinical human cancer models have very little predictive power in terms of how actual human beings-actual human tumors inside patients-will respond . " Despite the genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hospital gown , he says , the two species have key differences in physiology , tissue architecture , metabolic rate , immune system function , molecular signaling , you name it . So the tumors that arise in each , with the same flip of a genetic switch , arc vastly different . Says Weinberg : " A fundamental problem which remains to be solved in the whole cancer research effort , in terms of therapies , is that the preclinical models of human cancer , in large part , stink . " A few miles away , Bruce Chabner also finds the models lacking . A professor of medicine at Harvard and clinical director at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center , he explains that for a variety of biological reasons the " instant tumors " that researchers cause in mice simply ca n't mimic human cancer 's most critical and maddening trait , its quick-changing DNA . That characteristic , as we 've said , leads to staggering complexity in the most deadly tumors . " If you find a compound that cures hypertension in a mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how toxic it will be , but it will probably work , " says Chabner , who for many years ran the cancer-treatment division at the NCI . So researchers routinely try the same approach with cancer , " knocking out " ( neutralizing ) this gene or knocking in that one in a mouse and causing a tumor to appear . " Then they say , " I 've got a model for lung cancer ! ' Well , it ai n't a model for lung cancer , because lung cancer in humans has a hundred mutations , " he says . " It looks like the most complicated thing you 've ever seen , genetically . " Homer Pearce , who once ran cancer research and clinical investigation at Eli Lilly and is now research fellow at the drug company , agrees that mouse models are " woefully inadequate " for determining whether a drug will work in humans . " If you look at the millions and millions and millions of mice that have been cured , and you compare that to the relative success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment of metastatic disease clinically , " he says , " you realize that there just has to be something wrong with those models . " Vishva Dixit , a vice president for research in molecular oncology at Genentech in South San Francisco , is even more horrified that " 99% of investigators in industry and in academia use xenografts . " Why is the mouse model so heavily used ? Simple . " It is very convenient , easily manipulated , " Dixit explains . " You can assess tumor size just by looking at it . " Although drug companies clearly recognize the problem , they have n't fixed it . And they 'd better , says Weinberg , " if for no other reason than that hundreds of millions of dollars are being wasted every year by drug companies using these models . " Even more depressing is the very real possibility that reliance on this flawed model has caused researchers to pass over drugs that would work in humans . After all , if so many promising drugs that clobbered mouse cancers failed in man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hundreds of thousands of compounds discarded over the past 20 years might have been truly effective agents . Roy Herbst , who divides his time between bench and bedside at M.D. Anderson and who has run big trials on Iressa and other targeted therapies for lung cancer , is sure that happens often . " It 's something that bothers me a lot , " he says . " We probably lose a lot of things that either do n't have activity on their own , or we have n't tried in the right setting , or you do n't identify the right target . " If everyone understands there 's a problem , why is n't anything being done ? Two reasons , says Weinberg . First , there 's no other model with which to replace that poor mouse . Second , he says , " is that the FDA has created inertia because it continues to recognize these models as the gold standard for predicting the utility of drugs . " " WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF GOOD IDEAS " IT IS ONE OF THE MANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the FDA 's imperfect standards for judging drugs or the pharmaceutical companies ' imperfect models for testing them ? The riddle is applicable not just to early drug development , in which flawed animal models fool bench scientists into thinking their new compounds will wallop tumors in humans . It comes up , with far more important ramifications , in the last stage of human testing , when the FDA is looking for signs that a new drug is actually helping the patients who are taking it . In this case , the faulty model is called tumor regression . It is exciting to see a tumor shrink in mouse or man and know that a drug is doing that . A shrinking tumor is intuitively a good thing . So it is no surprise that it 's one of the key endpoints , or goals , in most clinical trials . That 's in no small part because it is a measurable goal : We can see it happening . ( When you read the word " response " in a newspaper story about some exciting new cancer drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But like the mouse , tumor regression by itself is actually a lousy predictor for the progression of disease . Oncologists can often shrink a tumor with chemo and radiotherapy . That sometimes makes the cancer easier to remove surgically . If not , it still may buy a little time . However , if the doctors do n't get every rotten cell , the sad truth is that the regression is not likely to improve the person 's chances of survival . That 's because when most malignant solid tumors are diagnosed , they are typically quite large already-the size of a grape , perhaps , with more than a billion cells in the tumor mass . By the time it 's discovered , there is a strong chance that some of those cells have already broken off from the initial tumor and are on their way to another part of the body . This is called metastasis . Most of those cells will not take root in another tissue or organ : A metastasizing cell has a very uphill battle to survive once it enters the violent churn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billion cells dividing like there 's no tomorrow , an ever-growing number of metastases will try to make the journey . Inevitably , some will succeed . In the end , it is not localized tumors that kill people with cancer ; it is the process of metastasis-an incredible 90% of the time . Aggressive cells spread to the bones , liver , lungs , brain , or other vital areas , wreaking havoc . So you 'd think that cancer researchers would have been bearing down on this insidious phenomenon for years , intently studying the intricate mechanisms of invasion . Hardly . According to a FORTUNE examination of NCI grants going back to 1972 , less than 0.5% of study proposals focused primarily on metastasis-trying to understand , for instance , its role in a specific cancer ( e.g. , breast , prostate ) or just the process itself . Of nearly 8,900 NCI grant proposals awarded last year , 92% did n't even mention the word metastasis . One accomplished researcher sent an elegant proposal into the NCI two years ago to study the epigenetics ( changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's now in its third resubmission , he says . " I mean , there is nothing known about that . But somehow I ca n't interest people in funding this ! " M.D. Anderson 's Josh Fidler suggests that metastasis is getting short shrift simply because " it 's tough . Okay ? And individuals are not rewarded for doing tough things . " Grant reviewers , he adds , " are more comfortable with the focused . Here 's an antibody I will use , and here 's blah-blah-blah-blah , and then I get the money . " Metastasis , on the other hand , is a big idea-an organism-wide phenomenon that may involve dozens of processes . It 's hard to do replicable experiments when there are that many variables . But that 's the kind of research we need . Instead , says Weinberg , researchers opt for more straightforward experiments that generate plenty of reproducible results . Unfortunately , he says , " the accumulation of data gives people the illusion they 've done something meaningful . " That drive to accumulate data also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . The FDA 's mandate is to make sure that a drug is safe and that it works before allowing its sale to the public . Thus , the regulators need to see hard data showing that a drug has had some effect in testing . However , it 's hard to see " activity " in preventing something from happening in the first place . There are probably good biomarkers-proteins , perhaps , circulating in the body-that can tell us that cancer cells have begun the process of spreading to other tissues . As of yet , though , we do n't know what they are . So pharma companies , quite naturally , do n't concentrate on solving the problem of metastasis ( the thing that kills people ) ; they focus on devising drugs that shrink tumors ( the things that do n't ) . Dozens of these drugs get approved anyway . At the same time , many don't-and the FDA is invariably blamed for holding up the War on Cancer . The fault , however , is less the umpire 's than the players ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't perform much better than the standard treatments . Or as Rick Pazdur , director of oncology drugs for the FDA , puts it , " It 's efficacy , stupid ! One of the major problems that we have is dealing with this meager degree of efficacy . " When it 's clear that something is working , the agency is generally quick to give it priority review and/or accelerated approval , two mechanisms that speed up the regulatory process for compounds aimed at life-threatening diseases . " We have a shortage of good ideas that are likely to work , " agrees Bruce Johnson , a Dana-Farber oncologist who runs lung-cancer research for institutions affiliated with the Harvard Medical School , a huge partnership that includes Massachusetts General Hospital , Brigham and Women 's Cancer Center , and others . That is also the devastating conclusion of a major study published last August in the British Medical Journal . Two Italian pharmacologists pored over the results of trials of 12 new anticancer drugs that had been approved for the European market from 1995 to 2000 , and compared them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find no substantial advantagesno improved survival , no better quality of life , no added safetywith any of the new agents . All of them , though , were several times more expensive than the old drugs . In one case , the price was 350 times higher . WHY THE NEW DRUGS DISAPPOINT FLAWED MODELS FOR DRUG development . Obsession with tumor shrinkage . Focus on individual cellular mechanisms to the near exclusion of what 's happening in the organism as a whole . All these failures come to a head in the clinical trial-a rigidly controlled , three-phase system for testing new drugs and other medical procedures in humans . The process remains the only way to get from research to drug approval-and yet it is hard to find anyone in the cancer community who is n't maddeningly frustrated by it . In February 2003 a blue-ribbon panel of cancer-center directors concluded that clinical trials are " long , arduous , " and burdened with regulation ; without major change and better resources , the panel concluded , the " system is likely to remain inefficient , unresponsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the process has little to offer them . Witness the fact that a stunning 97% of adults with cancer do n't bother to participate . There are two major problems with clinical trials . The first is that their duration and cost mean that drug companies-which sponsor the vast majority of such trials-have an overwhelming incentive to test compounds that are likely to win FDA approval . After all , they are public companies by and large , with shareholders demanding a return on investment . So the companies focus not on breakthrough treatments but on incremental improvements to existing classes of drugs . The process does not encourage risk taking or entrepreneurial approaches to drug discovery . It does not encourage brave new thinking . Not when a drug typically takes 12 to 14 years to develop . And not with $802 million-that 's the oft-cited cost of developing a drug-on the line . What 's more , the system essentially forces companies to test the most promising new compounds on the sickest patients-where it is easier to see some activity ( like shrinking tumors ) but almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has typically spread too far and the tumors have become too ridden with genetic mutations . Thus drugs that might have worked well in earlier-stage patients often never get the chance to prove it . ( As you 'll see , that may be a huge factor in the disappointing response so far of one class of promising new drugs . ) The second problem is even bigger : Clinical trials are focused on the wrong goal-on doing " proper " science rather than saving lives . It is not that they provide bad care-patients in trials are treated especially well . But the trials ' very reason for being is to test a hypothesis : Is treatment X better than treatment Y ? And sometimes-too often , sadly-the information generated by this tortuously long process does n't much matter . If you 've spent tenplus years to discover that a new drug shrinks a tumor by an average of 10% more than the existing standard of care , how many people have you really helped ? Take two drugs approved in February for cancer of the colon and rectum : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months just to enroll the necessary number of patients in clinical trials . Participating doctors then had to administer the drugs according to often arduous preset protocols , collecting reams of data along the way . ( ImClone 's well-known troubles with the FDA occurred because it had not set up its trials properly . ) And here 's what clinicians learned after years of testing . When Avastin was added to the standard chemotherapy regimen , the combination managed to extend the lives of some 400 patients with terminal colorectal cancer by a median 4.7 months . ( A previous trial of the drug on breast cancer patients failed . ) Oncologists consider the gain substantial , considering that those in advanced stages of the disease typically live less than 16 months . And Erbitux ? Although it did indeed shrink tumors , it has not been shown to prolong patients ' lives at all . Some certainly have fared well on the drug , but survival on average for the groups studied did n't change . Still , Erbitux was approved for use primarily in " third line " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A weekly dose costs $2,400 . Remember , it took several years and the participation of thousands of patients in three stages of testing , tons of data , and huge expense to find out what the clinicians and researchers already knew in the earliest stage of human testing : Neither drug will save more than a handful of the 57,000 people who will die of colorectal cancer this year . You could say the same for AstraZeneca 's Iressa , another in the new class of biological wonder drugs-compounds specifically " targeted " to disrupt the molecular signals in a cancer cell . Not a single controlled trial has shown Iressa to have a major patient benefit such as the easing of symptoms or improved survival-a fact that the company 's upbeat press releases admit as if it were legal boilerplate . Even so , the FDA okayed the pill last year for last-ditch use against a type of lung cancer , citing the fact that it had shrunk tumors in 10% of patients studied . " Very smart people , with a lot of money , have done trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted drugs , " says Dana-Farber 's Bruce Johnson . " AstraZeneca tested Iressa . Isis Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly tested a compound called Isis 3521 . Several different companies ended up investing tens of millions of dollars , and all came up with a big goose egg . " The one targeted drug that clearly is n't a goose egg is Novartis 's Gleevec , which has been shown to save lives as well as stifle tumors . The drug has a dramatic effect on an uncommon kind of leukemia called CML and an even more rare stomach cancer named GIST . Early reports say it also seems to work , in varying degrees , in up to three other cancers . Gleevec 's success has been held out as the " proof of principle " that the strategy we 've followed in the War on Cancer all these years has been right . But not even Gleevec is what it seems . CML is not a complicated cancer : In it , a single gene mutation causes a critical signaling mechanism to go awry ; Gleevec ingeniously interrupts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as five to ten different things going wrong . Second , even " simple " cancers get smarter : The malignant cells long exposed to the drug ( which must be taken forever ) mutate their way around the molecular signal that Gleevec blocks , building drug resistance . No wonder cancer is so much more vexing than heart disease . " You do n't get multiple swings , " says Bob Cohen , senior director for commercial diagnostics at Genentech . Use a drug that does not destroy the tumor completely and " the heterogeneity will evolve from the surviving cells and say , " I do n't give a rat 's ass ! You ca n't screw me up with this stuff . ' Suddenly you 're squaring and cubing the complexity . That 's where we are . " And that 's why the only chance is to attack the disease earlier-and on multiple fronts . Three drugs , four drugs , five drugs in combination . Cocktails of experimental compounds , of course , were what doctors used to control HIV , whose rapidly mutating virus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinician and scientist interviewed for this story believes a similar approach is needed with the new generation of anticancer drugs . But once again , institutional forces within the cancer world make it nearly impossible . Combining unapproved drugs in clinical trials brings up a slew of legal and regulatory issues that cause pharma companies to squirm . While many drug- company oncologists are as committed to the public 's well-being as government or cancer-center researchers , they have less flexibility to take chances on an idea . Ultimately , they need FDA approval for their investigational compounds . If two or three unapproved drugs are tested in concert , it 's even harder to figure out what 's working and what is n't , and whether one drug is responsible for sideeffects or the combination . " It becomes much more challenging in the context of managing the databases , interpreting the results , and owning the data , " adds Lilly 's Pearce . Over dinner at Ouisie 's Table in Houston , M.D. Anderson 's Len Zwelling , who oversees regulatory compliance for the center 's 800-plus clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chief of pediatrics there , have no trouble venting about the legal barriers that seem to be growing out of control . It takes no more than ten minutes for Kleinerman to rattle off three stories about trying to bring together different drug companies in clinical trials for kids with cancer . In the first attempt , the trial took so long that the biotech startup with the promising agent went out of business . In the second the lawyers haggled over liability concerns until both companies pulled out . The third , however , was the worst . There were two drugs that together seemed to jolt the immune system into doing a better job of targeting malignant cells of osteosarcoma , a bone cancerthat occurs in children . " Working with the lawyers , it was just impossible , " she says , " because each side wanted to own the rights to the combination ! " CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CANCER STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM , much of our failure in fighting cancer-and more important , much of the potential for finally winning this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago the Greek physician Hippocrates described cancer as a disease that spread out and grabbed on to another part of the body like " the arms of a crab , " as he elegantly put it . Similarly , medical textbooks today say cancer begins when the cells of an expanding tumor push through the thin protein " basement " membrane that separates them from another tissue . It 's a fancy way of saying that to be cancer , a malignant cell has to invade another part of the body . Michael Sporn , a professor of pharmacology and medicine at Dartmouth Medical School , has two words for this : " Absolute nonsense ! " He goes on : " We 've been stuck with this definition of what cancer is from 1890 . It 's what I was taught in medical school : " It 's not cancer until there 's invasion . ' That 's like saying the barn is n't on fire until there are bright red flames coming out of the roof . " In fact , cancer begins much earlier than that . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sporn , who was recently named an Eminent Scholar by the NCI : Let 's aggressively find those embers that have been smoldering in many of us for years-and douse them before they become a full-fledged blaze . Prevent cancer from ever entering that deadly stage of malignancy in the first place . Sporn , who spent more than three decades at the NCI , has been struggling for many years to get fellow researchers to start thinking about cancer not as a state of being ( that is , an invasive group of fast-growing cells ) but as a process , called carcinogenesis . Cancer , as Sporn tells it , is a multistage disease that goes through various cell transformations and sometimes long periods of latency in its progression . Thus , the trick is to intervene earlier in that process-especially at key points when lesions occur ( known to doctors as dysplasias , hyperplasias , and other precancerous cell phases ) . To do that , the medical community has to break away from the notion that people in an early stage of carcinogenesis are " healthy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy if they 're on a path toward cancer . If this seems radical and far-fetched , consider : We 've prevented millions of heart attacks and strokes by using the very same strategy . Sporn likes to point out that heart disease does n't start with the heart attack ; it starts way earlier with the elevated blood cholesterol and lipids that cause arterial plaque . So we treat those . Stroke does n't start with the blood clot in the brain . It starts with hypertension . So we treat it with both lifestyle changes and drugs . " Cardiovascular disease , of course , is nowhere near as complex as cancer is , " he says , " but the principle is the same . " Adds Sporn : " All these people who are obsessed with cures , cures , cures , and the miraculous cure which is still eluding us , they 're being-I hate to use this word , but if you want to look at it pragmatically-they 're being selfish by ignoring what could be done in terms of prevention . " The amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can start applying it right now , Precancerous cell changes mark the progression to many types of solid-tumor cancers ; many such changes are relatively easy to find and remove , and others are potentially reversible with current drugs and other treatments . A perfect example is the Pap smear , which detects premalignant changes in the cells of the cervix . That simple procedure , followed by the surgical removal of any lesions , has dropped the incidence and death rates from cervical cancer by 78% and 79% , respectively , since the practice began in the 1950s . In countries where Pap smears are n't done , cervical cancer is a leading killer of women . Same goes for colon cancer . Not every adenomatous polyp in the colon ( a lesion in the organ 's lining ) goes on to become malignant and invasive . But colon cancers have to go through this abnormal step on their way to becoming deadly . The list of other dysplasia-like conditions goes on and on , from Barrett 's esophagus ( a precursor to cancer there ) to hyperkeratosis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already doing this kind of testing with some cancers , but they need to do it much , much more . Some complain that the telltale biomarkers of carcinogenesis , while getting more predictive , still are far from definitive , and that we should wait until we know more . ( Sound familiar ? ) Researchers in heart disease , meanwhile , have taken an opposite tack and been far more successful . Neither high cholesterol nor hypertension guarantees future cardiovascular disease , but they 're treated anyway . A few cancer researchers have made great strides in finding more early warning signs-looking for protein " signatures " in blood , urine , or even skin swabs that can identify precancerous conditions and very early cancers that are likely to progress . For instance , Lance Liotta , chief of pathology at the NCI , has demonstrated that ovarian cancer can be detected by a high-tech blood test-one that identifies a unique " cluster pattern " of some 70 different proteins in a woman 's blood . " We 've discovered a previously unknown ocean of markers , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With current drugs , early-stage ovarian cancer is more than 90% curable ; late stage is 75% deadly . Early results on a protein test for pancreatic cancer are promising as well , says Liotta . Yes , the strategy has costs . Some say wholesale testing of biomarkers and early lesions-many of which wo n't go on to become invasive cancers-would result in a huge burden for the healthcare system and lead to a wave of potentially dangerous surgeries to remove things that might never become lethal anyway . But surely the costs of not acting are much greater . Indeed , it is an encouraging sign that Andy von Eschenbach , director of the NCI , and Elias Zerhouni , who leads the NIH , are both believers in this strategy . " What our investment in biomedical research has led us to is understanding cancer as a disease process and the various steps and stages along that pathwayfrom being very susceptible to it , to the point where you get it , and ultimately suffer and die from it , " says von Eschenbach , a former urologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , he says , he wants to lead the NCI on a " mission to prevent the process from occurring in the first place or detect the occurrence of cancer early enough to eliminate it with less morbidity . " HOW TO WIN THE WAR THERE HAS BEEN TALK like this before . But the money to fund the assault never came . And several cancer experts interviewed for this story worry that the new rhetoric from the NCI , while encouraging , has yet to move beyond lip service . For the nation finally to turn the tide in this brutal war , the cancer community must embrace a coordinated assault on this disease . Doctors and scientists now have enough knowledge to do what Sydney Farber hoped they might do 33 years ago : to work as an army , not as individuals fighting on their own . The NCI can begin this transformation right away by drastically changing the way it funds research . It can undo the culture created by the ROIs ( the grants that launched a million me-too mouse experiments ) by shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big picture . The cancer agency already has such funding in place , for endeavors called SPOREs ( short for specialized programs of research excellence ) . These bring together researchers from different disciplines to solve aspects of the cancer puzzle . Even so , funding for individual study awards accounts for a full quarter of the agency 's budget and is more than 12 times the money spent on SPORE grants . The agency needs to stop being an automatic teller machine for basic science and instead use the taxpayers ' money to marshall a broad assault on this elusive killerfrom figuring out how to stop metastasis in its tracks to coming up with testing models that better mimic human response . At the same time , the NCI should commit itself to finding biomarkers that are predictive of cancer development and that , with a simple blood or urine test ( like PSA ) or an improved molecular imaging technique ( PET and CT scans ) , can give patients a chance to preempt or control the disease . For that matter , as a nation we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths , according to the NCI-by getting people to stop smoking . This all-too-obvious observation was made by every researcher I interviewed . Alas , this is not a million-dollar commitment . It 's a billion-dollar one . But the nation is already investing billions in research , and that does n't even include the $64 billion a year we spend on treatment . To make the resource shift easier , Congress should move the entire federal war chest for cancer into one bureaucracy , not five . Cancer research should be managed by the NCI , not the VA and Pentagon . Just as important , the cancer leadership , the FDA , and lawmakers need to transform drug testing and approval into a process that delivers information on what 's working and what 's not to the patients far faster . If the best hope to treat most cancer lies in using combinations of drugs , we 're going to have to remove legal constraints and give drug companies incentives to test investigational compounds together in shorter trials . Those should be funded by the NCI-in a process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies : If joint activity showed marked improvement in survival , the FDA process could be jump-started . " It 's going to require a community conversation to facilitate this change , " says Eli Lilly 's Homer Pearce . " I think everyone believes that at the end of the day , cancer is going to be treated with multiple targeted agents-maybe in combination with traditional chemotherapy drugs , maybe not . Because that 's where the biology is leading us , it 's a future that we have to embrace-though it will definitely require different models of cooperation . " When clinical trials begin to offer patients more than incremental improvements over existing drug treatments , people with cancer will rush into the studies . And when participation rates go up , it will accelerate the process so that we can test more combinations faster and cheaper . To see which drugs truly have promise , however , we need to do one thing more : test them on people in less advanced stages of disease . The reason , once again , comes back to cancer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also riddles tumors with mutations . When cancer patients are in the end stage of the disease , drugs that might have a potent effect on newer cancers fail to show much progress at all . Our current crop of rules , however , pushes drug companies into this can't-win situation , where the only way out is incremental improvements to existing therapies . Drugs that might well help some cancer patients are now getting tossed by the wayside because they do n't help people whom they could n't have helped in any case . This has to stop . Witness what has happened with the new class of drugs developed to fight the process called angiogenesis ( " angio " refers to blood vessels , and " genesis " to new growth ) - compounds designed to block the development of capillaries that supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors . Avastin is the best known , but there are some 40 antiangiogenesis drugs in clinical trials . This , by the way , is one of those big ideas that the cancer culture did n't take seriously , and would barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago by Judah Folkman , now a surgeon at Children 's Hospital Boston . While studying artificial blood in a Navy lab , he was struck by a simple and seemingly obvious idea : Every cell needs oxygen to grow , including cancer cells . Since oxygen in the body comes from blood , fast-growing tumors could n't develop without access to blood vessels . Folkman later figured out that tumors actually recruited new blood vessels by sending out a protein signal . If you could turn off that growth signal , he reasoned , you could starve the tumors and keep them tiny . The surgeon submitted a paper on his experiments to various medical journals , but the article was rejected time and again . That is , until an editor at the New England Journal of Medicine heard Folkman give a lecture and offered to publish it in the Journal 's Beth Israel Hospital Seminars in 1971-ironically , the year the War on Cancer began . After decades of resistance , the cancer culture has finally come around to Folkman 's thinking-as the reception greeting Avastin makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be realized only when doctors can use them to treat earlier-stage patients . That 's because the drugs designed to choke the tumor 's blood supply often take a far longer time to work than traditional toxic chemo-time that people with advanced disease and fast-growing cancers may not have . Doctors also need the freedom to administer such drugs in combination . Tumors recruit blood vessels through several signaling mechanisms , researchers believe , so the best approach is to apply several drugs , cutting off all routes . Who knows ? A new paradigm in treatment may emerge from Folkman 's 40-year-old idea . Yet to make this simple and seemingly obvious shift , the entire cancer culture must change-from the rules governing drug approval to tort law and intellectual property rights . Science now has the knowledge and the tools ; we need to act . THE GOOD DOCTOR IN THE WEEKS SINCE I finished my reporting and began writing this story , one image has stuck with me : a drawerful of letters . The letters belong to Eric Winer , a 47-year-old physician at Dana-Farber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour when he showed me the drawer . It was late on a Friday evening , and Winer , still in the clinic , was describing the progress we were making in this war , his reedy voice cracking higher every so often . He was telling me of his optimism . That 's when he mentioned the drawer : " That enthusiasm is very much tempered by the fact that we have 40,000 women dying of breast cancer every year . Um , and you know , I 've got a file full of letters that are almost entirely from family members of my patients who died .... " I asked to see it , and then asked again , and there it was , in the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet-two overstuffed folders of mostly handwritten notes . Once the letters go in , Winer confessed , he never looks at them again . " I do n't go back , " he said sheepishly . " My excuse initially was that if anyone wanted to say I was a bad doctor , I 'd hold on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could prove that I was n't . " If the walls of his office are any indication , there is no way Winer is a bad doctor . They are covered with loving mementos from patients . There is a picture of Tolstoy from a woman whose breast tumors were initially shrunk by Herceptin , but who died within five years . ( Winer had once mentioned to her to that he had majored in Russian history at Yale . ) There 's a photo of the Grand Canyon taken by a young nurse who was determined to take a trip out West with her 10-year-old son before she died . The daughter of another patient even cornered Lance Armstrong and begged him to sign a neon-yellow jersey for Winer , who is an avid cyclist . It is the most prominent thing in his office . No , it is n't just the patients in this War on Cancer who need renewed hope . It is the foot soldiers as well . Sidebar Avastin , Erbitux , Gleevec ... The new wonder drugs might make you think we 're finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how to turn the fight around .

Radiation therapy soon after Wilhelm Roentgen 's discovery of X-rays in 1895 , some doctors predicted that the high-energy waves from exotic " cyclotrons " could be used to kill most cancerous tumors . A century-plus later , targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not the magic bullet many thought . Interferon In 1980 , the world was afrenzy about the big " IF " - an immune-system booster produced by the body in tiny quantities-as word spread that this natural virus fighter could also shrink tumors . Though still in use in some cancer therapies , IF has not fulfilled its early promise . Interleukin-2 Like Interferon , this protein helps activate the body 's immune system . And like IF , IL-2 was once thought to be the " cancer breakthrough " we were waiting for ( see FORTUNE 'S 1985 cover , lower right ) . But after years of testing and tweaking , the therapy has led to only scattered remissions in patients . Endostatin After a flurry of early hype , this first of many compounds designed to fight tumor angiogenesis failed dramatically in human tests . The jury is still out on its next-generation kin . Gleevec The little yellow pill from Novartis has wondrous effect in a few rare cancers involving simple mutations , although the disease can grow resistant to this " targeted " biological drug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Intel 's Andy Grove . " Everybody plays his part , everybody does what 's right by his own life , and the total just does n't work . " Sidebar " Metastasis is a big idea .
