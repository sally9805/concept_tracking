Life was a little simpler for me before I started thinking that I could be Dylan Klebold 's mother . Klebold , the Littleton , Colo. , teen who along with his buddy Eric Harris murdered 13 people in a rampage at Columbine High School in 1999 , has etched his surname into the national consciousness as a symbol of everything that could go wrong in a family . Like many parents , I had always assumed  --  perhaps hoped  --  that once this family 's story was known , it would be clear that the parents were checked out , maybe even uncaring , and so on some level responsible for their son 's monstrosity . Now Parents Under Siege , a new book by researchers James Garbarino and Claire Bedard , challenges that smug assumption . <P> Garbarino has spent a lot of time interviewing Klebold 's parents ( though he was constrained from directly quoting them , since they are being sued by victims ' families ) . Tom and Sue Klebold , he told me , turn out to be loving and involved parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at knowing their son . Rather , he deceived them about who he actually was . Garbarino considers the Klebolds an extreme case of a common phenomenon , where children grow adept at hiding their vulnerabilities and dark secrets , while at the same time being exposed to influences that can translate their adolescent violent fantasies into reality . <P> Parents Under Siege urges parents to be vigilant about the media their children consume and knowledgeable about the social environment at school . The atmosphere at Columbine High , while presumably positive for other children , was toxic for Dylan Klebold . The movies he saw , the games he played and his friendship with Harris were all part of a confluence of influences his parents did n't know about . <P> Teens have secret lives  --  different selves they show to their family , friends and teachers , as Garbarino learned when he surveyed 275 freshmen at Cornell University . These " good " kids reported committing crimes , drinking , doing drugs and having sex without their folks ' ever knowing . The only way for even watchful parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell them . <P> So how do you get children to let you into their worlds ? Garbarino echoes other child development experts in saying you should start when they 're young and do n't know any differently . You have to let them know early on that their fears and concerns will be met with calm , love and guidance , not disapproval . Garbarino cites studies showing a connection between how much kids divulge to their parents and how well-adjusted they are . He is convinced that if Dylan Klebold had shared his desperation with his parents , they could have helped him . <P> You can e-mail Amy at
