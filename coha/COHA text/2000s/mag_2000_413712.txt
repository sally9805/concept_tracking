The Mammoth Big Dig Highway Project Shortchanges Transit // Depending on who you ask , Boston 's Big Dig , a mammoth undertaking designed to replace the city 's aging central highway infrastructure with an eight-lane underground tunnel , is either one of the wonders of the known world or a colossal boondoggle , the biggest waste of $13.6 billion ever conceived . Not up for debate , however , is that the project has run massively over its original $2.5 billion budget , and is now so late that the last hard hat wo n't get removed until 2005 , 14 years after the first spade went into the ground . So big is the Big Dig that , according to Dick Bauer , a Greater Boston Legal Services attorney and bike enthusiast , " There 's now no money in Massachusetts for any other transportation project . " This is the largest public works project in U.S. history . There 's no question that Boston-area commuters need some relief . The city 's Central Artery , an elevated six-lane highway running right through the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete before it was even completed . The highway , typical of neighborhood-destroying urban renewal projects of its era , cuts the city in two , isolates the waterfront , and mindlessly bypasses Logan Airport . The Big Dig is supposed to sort all that out with a tunnel to the airport , an underground highway with 30 acres of parkland above , five new interchanges and two new bridge crossings over the Charles River . The press has been merciless about the Big Dig , daily bannering headlines about new corruption investigations , lawsuits , construction delays and cost overruns . The project was included in The Boston Phoenix 's " Best of Boston " issue-as " Best Waste of Taxpayer Money . " Congressman Tom Petri ( R-WI ) awarded it the " Porker Award . " And Fred Salvucci , former Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation and one of the project 's central architects , derides it now as a " violation of environmental justice . " He bristles with vitriol as he points out that transit links have been cancelled , low-income neighborhoods have been violated by 50-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansions have fallen by the wayside . The state 's own attorney general , Scott Harshbarger , teamed up with Boston 's Conservation Law Foundation ( CLF ) and sued every agency involved in the Big Dig for their failure to keep their promises about improving the city 's bus and transit lines . Seth Kaplan , a CLF attorney , says the suit , now settled , demanded that the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ( MTA ) , the project 's overseer , live up to its commitments with upgrades to subway service , cleaner buses , improved ferry service and better park-and-ride facilities . Last June an unnamed whistleblower also filed suit , charging that the project contained at least $10 million in " false claims . " According to Ron Killian , the MTA 's manager of environmental permits and procedures , just to get the Big Dig approved the contractors had to make more than 2,000 individual commitments to get through the bureaucratic hurdle of 1,000 different permit actions . Given all that , it 's not surprising that Sean O'Neill , MTA 's spokesman , was somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer . O'Neill , who calls himself a " professional spear catcher for the biggest show on Earth , " says , " There 's a hulabaloo around this project because it 's not happening in a field in Kansas , but instead right in the heart of an historic city . " O'Neill assured the visitors in hard hats and safety vests that simply fixing the Central Artery as it is would cost $6.5 billion . " We 're trying to improve air quality in Boston , " O'Neill contends . " Right now it 's like sucking a tailpipe with all the idling cars stuck in traffic . " Population increases , urban sprawl and an ongoing love of the automobile have produced massive infrastructure bills that are now coming due in America 's central cities . Don Chen , director of the Smart Growth Program at the Surface Transportation Policy Project in Washington , points out that Washington is itself undergoing similar headaches with its improvements to the notorious Springfield Interchange , a/k/a " The Mixing Bowl . Originally projected to cost $300 million , the early-stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overruns are a matter of course with highway projects , " Chen says . " To get the Big Dig built , a lot of commitments and promises were made early on that were not upheld . This is becoming politics as usual . " " What 's your biggest gripe ? " O'Neill asked the group . " Traffic and the fact that it 's taking too long , " they said , almost in unison . Complaining about the Big Dig has become almost as much a ritual in Boston as baked beans . Also vocal are residents of western Massachusetts , who have seen their transit projects wither as $8.5 billion of state money was committed to the Dig , now a clanging construction site that runs the length of central Boston , 7.8 miles of infrastructure and 161 lane miles . Huge steel girders were being dropped into place by 10-story cranes , and hundreds of cables were being readied for the seemingly impossible feat of lining up 45,000-ton concrete tunnel sections to within a sixteenth of an inch . Men clung to metal gridwork on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proud to be Union Tunnel Workers , " read a truck bumper sticker . O'Neill looked around admiringly . " If we did n't do this project , we might as well shut down Boston , " he said , ignoring the fact that the city was practically shut down anyway . Even so , there is much to admire in the Central Artery Project . Sergiu Luchian , MTAs intelligent transportation systems manager , explains that the new high-tech highway will boast 430 closed-circuit TV cameras , 300 lane control signals and 10 variable speed limit message boards so the equivalent of air traffic controllers can keep the cars and trucks moving . There are fire alarm pulls every 150 feet in the tunnels ( with five-minute dispatch times ) , the world 's most sophisticated ventilation system , and even a radio system that re-transmits local radio stations underground ( and can be interrupted to send drivers emergency messages ) . A specially designed MIT traffic simulator helped to create a system that can ( at least on paper ) handle 300,000 vehicles every 24 hours , 13,000 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's even crazier than what air traffic controllers do , " says Luchian . For all its splendor , however , the new interchange will probably end up illustrating the smart growth principle that you ca n't build your way out of congestion . In July , Massachusetts Environmental Affairs Secretary Robert Durand said that what the Boston Globe called " a glittering new neighborhood on South Boston 's mostly desolate waterfront " would probably be doomed to failure because of nightmarish projected traffic congestion . And that 's with the addition of a planned Silver Line underground bus system , the transit crown jewel in the multi-billion-dollar Central Artery Project . Even if the Silver Line is filled to capacity , he said , it " will not be enough . " <p>
