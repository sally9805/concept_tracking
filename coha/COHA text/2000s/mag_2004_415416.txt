1 System of a Down Not Yet Titled It 's been three years since the asphalt-thick riffs and freaky operatic vocals of Toxicity helped begin radio 's slow climb out of its mi-metal morass , and although the 2002 outtakes comp Steal This Album ! was a nice little snack to tide us over , we 're getting impatient . " Do n't expect the same thing that you heard in Toxicity and Steal , " warns guitarist and songwriter Daron Malakian , who cites European black metal bands ( his favorite : Satyricon ) as inspiration just before waxing rhapsodic over the Beatles ' White Album . " But I would n't say we 've completely lost our identity , either . We 're going into a lot of new musical ground . I just feel like the music is more mature in a lot of ways . " So what will it all sound like ? Though Malakian avoids specifics , he promises an orchestra , some obscure Middle Eastern instruments , and " pure schizophrenia .

Sure , frontman Paul Banks still warbles like the ghost of Joy Division 's Ian Curtis , but on opening track " Next Exit , " grinding guitars and rattling tambourines veer into Jesus and Mary Chain territory , while soaring synths make " Not Even Jail " a surprisingly danceable dirge . ( Sept. 28 ) 10 Nas Street 's Disciple To that rarefied club of rappers with double-disc albums ( Wu-Tang Clan , 2Pac , the Notorious B.I.G. , etc. ) , add Queens hip-hop legend Nas , whose eighth album is a massive 20 tracks . The set is one of his strongest , featuring the kind of existential hip-hop poetry and cold-blooded gangster vrit that made him rap 's rookie of the year back in 1994 . ( Dec. 7 ) 11 Pavement Crooked Rain , Crooked Rain : L.A. 's Desert Origins Ten years on , Pavement 's genre-defining second album-which cemented their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did way back in 1994 . This new two-disc set overflows with 39 bonus tracks , including B sides , outtakes , and live material from the era , as well as 11 never-before-heard songs . ( Oct. 26 ) 12 De La Soul The Grind Date P. Diddy would never deliver a line like this : " The meek shall inherit the earth , but do n't forget the poor are the ones who inherit the debt . " That 's from the title cut off De La Soul 's eighth album , their first studio CD since 2001 . It 's a return to form for hip-hop 's veteran thinking men , who here muse on life as aging B-boys with mortgages , families , and a conscience . ( Oct. 5 ) 13 Raphael Saadiq Raphael Saadiq as Ray Ray Having firmly established himself as one of R &B's; most talented writer-producers ( Erykah Badu , Angie Stone , D'Angelo ) , Saadiq steps out from behind the boards for his funkdafied sophomore solo CD . In contrast to the classic-soul stylings of 2002 's acclaimed Instant Vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his alter ego 's amorous exploits . Check out the partial reunion of his former groups Tony Toni Tone and Lucy Pearl on first radio single " Rifle Love . " ( Oct. 5 ) 14 Brian Wilson SMiLE Of our " 25 Most Anticipated Albums of the Fall , " only one qualifies as " The Album Some People Have Been Anticipating for the Last 37 Falls . " The Beach Boys " Smile got bumped off the release schedule back in 1967 , but Wilson has now rerecorded it from scratch . Obsessives and casual Brian-philes alike will most assuredly be cracking the title expression . ( Sept. 28 ) 8 Elvis Costello When Elvis Costello &; the Imposters ' Delivery Man arrives , pundits will inevitably enthuse that the journey-man has rediscovered what he does best : rock &; roll . " They always say that ! " Costello laughs . " It 's a rhythm &; blues record , in my opinion . We tried to go to the vanishing point where country meets soul . " They found it by setting up shop in Oxford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sessions came to resemble : " It 's mostly the sound of four people playing in the room with no separation , with live vocals , " he says . In bluesy moments , they sound closer to Los Lobos than Costello 's band of yore . " The Attractions were one of the best bands of their time , but one thing they were never particularly good at was playing a groove . " The lmposters are the Attractions except for new bassist Davey Faragher , but Costello insists that 's made a world of difference in finding a bottom-heavier and , yes , groove-oriented sound . Do n't need all that soulful yowling ? Costello delivers a vocal-free orchestral CD , the Shakespeare-inspired dance score II Sogno , the same day ... perhaps to confound rock purists who might 've otherwise saluted him for getting back to basics . ( Sept. 21 ) - Chris Willman 2 Eminem Encore He 's given white rap street cred , powered a Hollywood flick , and turned a so-so crew of Detroit MCs ( D12 ) into chart-topping stars . Now America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible streak with a fourth solo album-and the product is under tighter security than the Bush twins . But according to sources in the Shady secret service , Encore will sound a lot like , well , Eminem : crude wit , intricate rhymes , and once again a disc produced by Marshall himself and Dr. Dre . Oh yeah , one more thing : It 's gon na be huge . ( Nov. 16 ) 3 U2 Not Yet Titled Maybe they really could n't leave All That You Cant Leave Behind behind . Typically , U2 have undertaken some startling changes of direction between albums , but that 's not the case with their latest disc . A preview of a nearly completed version reveals that if anything , it 's even more guitar-oriented , hopeful , straightforward , and irony-free . Rock radio will love the first single , " Vertigo , " which has the Edge riffing as if to win over kids weaned on Jet and Velvet Revolver . ( November ) 4 Destiny 's Child In the two and a half years since their last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , right . Michelle Williams starred in a Broadway show , Kelly Rowland scored a hit with Nelly , and Beyonc , well , just call her the Queen of All Media . The supreme soul trio managed to clear just two months this summer to record tracks for the group 's fifth studio album . In fact , the album is n't quite finished yet , so some details-like , say , a title-are n't available . But Rowland promises that the disc will " definitely show a side of Destiny 's Child that a lot of people have n't seen . " Which means , we think , more sex ! " We talk about a lot more , um ... mature subjects , " she says with a giggle . " You know-situations that older people go through . " Heavyweight producers like Rodney Jerkins and Rockwilder contribute to the CD , and titles include " Game Over " and " Cater to You , " which Rowland explains " is about a woman catering to her man in every aspect you can think of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) - Michael Endelman 5 Gwen Stefani Not Yet Titled Taking her musical cues from such ' ' 80s electro-pop mavens as Eurythmies , Prince , Madonna , and Cyndi Lauper , the No Doubt frontwoman clearly just wants to have fun on her hyperkinetic debut solo disc . From the plucky ticktock house beat and wittily observational lyrics ( " Take a chance , you stupid ho ! " ) of " What You Waiting For ? " to the cartoonish , Andre 3000-produced ditty " Bubble Pop Electric , " the set finds Stefani in frisky , adventurous form . In addition to the Neptunes , Dr. Dre , and Nellee Hooper , the retro-cool guest list for her eclectic dance party includes New Order , Depeche Mode 's Martin Gore , and Wendy &; Lisa . ( Nov. 23 ) 6 Elliott Smith from a basement on the hill Largely just basic tracks at the time of his sudden , gruesome death last year , Smith 's fragile swan song blends the drug-addled anger of early albums with the Spectoresque sonics of recent work . It 's an apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dreamy dirge " King 's Crossing " will stand as one of his most resplendent performances . ( Oct. 19 ) Handsome Boy Modeling School White People Handsome Boy 's second CD is the best party you 'll be invited to this fall . The hosts are two funny , talented guys ( producers Prince Paul and Dan the Automator ) . There 's a nice mix of cool dudes ( Pharrell , the RZA , Jack Johnson ) and cute girls ( Cat Power , Julee Cruise ) . Add some real wild cards ( John Gates , Mike Patton ) , and you get a novel soundtrack of head-nodding hip-hop and smooth blue-eyed soul . BYOB . ( Nov. 9 ) 20 Shania Twain That Shania is quite the two-timer . " Hey , Billy , I 'm having a party . Wan na comeP " she coos at the start of her new single , " Party for Two .

" - Sugar Ray 's Mark McGrath being the lucky duck who joins her in the pop mix of the same tune . These are two of four new tracks on her Greatest Hits . Let the hoi polloi lust after her hits ( all 17 of them ) . To the bubble-gum aficionados among us , Twain and husband/producer Mutt Lange are the new Queen and King of Pop , turning out ear candy like no one since ABBA . That 's why we 're craving the new confections , which will also include the ballad " Do n't ! " and " I Ai n't No Quitter , " a country foot stomper harking back to her twangier days . " These songs would 've been the beginning of my next record , " says Twain . " They 're really strong , and I 've got mixed feelings , because it would 've been great to have that power behind an all-new album . But I need the space to write and I do n't want to disappear for another two years . " That 's okay-junkies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whatever dribs and drabs Twain offers . ( Nov. 9 ) - CW 22 Joseph Arthur Our Shadows Will Remain For his fourth album , the eerie singer-songwriter ditched his New York City digs and sequestered himself in New Orleans to create a collection of powerfully emotional ( but tuneful ) exorcisms . Each listen reveals something more , from the mellifluous jaunt of " Echo Park " to " Wasted , " a beat-heavy ode to stumbling about in a dark narcosis . ( Sept. 28 ) 23 " Left of the Dial " boxed set Before alt-rock was a radio format , disillusioned Reagan-era teens cobbled together a soundtrack from a disjointed mix of punk , Britpop , new wave , and Goth-otherwise known as college rock . This four-CD set expertly combs the dark underside of ' ' 80s rock and includes great tracks from the Pixies , the Smiths , the Go-Betweens , Minor Threat , and many more . ( Oct. 5 ) 24 Talib Kweli The Beautiful Struggle The bookish hip-hop MC aims to escape the underground with his second solo disc , an inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Neptunes , Kanye West , and Just Blaze ensure that the tracks are radio ready , while cameos from Mary J. Blige and Faith Evans bring some beauty to this thesaurus-adoring rhyme fiend . ( Sept. 28 ) 25 Kimya Dawson hidden vagenda As half of the indie-folk duo Moldy Peaches , Dawson dresses up in bunny suits and sings scatological ditties . Yet while her first studio disc tackles some odd topics ( kidnapping ? a frisky pit bull ? a " power ballad " about anthrax ? ) , the tone is more subdued , with her peculiar voice lending unexpected tenderness . An odd-and oddly touching-collection . ( Oct. 5 ) Credits Written and reported by KyIe Anderson , Ryan Dombal , Michael Endelman , Raymond Fiore , Timothy Gunatilaka , Brian Hiatt , Nancy Miller , Whitney Pastorek , Michele Romero , and Chris Willman 15 Good Charlotte Even as TRL kids made Good Charlotte rich and famous , older listeners dismissed them as another pop-punk act with more tattoos than talent . But The Chronicles of Life and Death , the follow-up to 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " As a band and as people , we 've grown up , " says frontman Joel Madden , 25 . " We wanted to make a better record . " They did . With its deeper lyrics , less obvious melodies , and more nuanced arrangements , Life and Death is an undeniable step forward . And the new album sounds like a real band playing together rather than an overproduced studio creation . " A lot of the takes are from the demos , " Madden says . " We captured that raw emotion . " And a lot of influences , from the U2-tinged " We Believe " to the grungy " Walk Away . " " Releasing another Hopeless would have been really easy , and maybe safer , " says Madden . " But we have to challenge ourselves . " ( Oct. 5 ) - Brian Hiatt 16 Lucinda Williams/ NekoCase Live at The Fillmore/The Tigers Have Spoken Williams achieves full-on livewire status with her first concert disc , a double CD recorded last year . It does n't have to be a studio project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the track listing , and the ( as-yet-unnamed ) release date are all subject to change . Fellow alt-country queen case is also cooking up a live disc , but Neko 's mostly doing cover tunes ( including Loretta Lynn 's " Rated X " ) . ( Tigers : Nov. 9 ) 17 Jimmy Eat World Futures The Mesa , Ariz. , foursome 's last album , 2001 's Jimmy Eat World , helped launch the modern emo era , making them pop stars in the process . Now the effusive young men are back , and while hyper-melodic tracks like " Work " and " Pain " should help them avoid becoming one-hit wonders , emo fans will drool over the entire 11-song package . ( Oct. 19 ) 18 American Music Club Love Songs for Patriots Mark Eitzel 's got your Patriot Act right here , buddy . The singer seemingly got riled up enough about the state of American affairs that he reunited his old band , American Music Club , to write ( part of ) an album about it . ( see ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Patriots , AMC 's first disc since ' ' 94 , is more brooding and wry than outraged , as risible titles like " Song of the Rats Leaving the Sinking Ship " might suggest . ( Oct. 12 ) 19 Green Day American Idiot Four years after their last album , Warning , the masters of the three-minute pop-punk anthem have recorded an ambitious and angsty rock opera about a disaffected kid who splits town with a girl . Amazingly , Idiot boasts not one but two five-part , nine-minute-plus tracks . Think of it as Sgt. Pepper 's with a Mohawk . ( Sept. 21 ) 21 Tom Waits Real Gone One new song title , " Clang Boom Steam , " just about sums up Waits " instrumental approach on his latest CD , which reunites him with longtime aides like Marc Ribot and Les claypool . The music might be described as the dirty blues played over ambient rhythms from the early industrial revolution .
