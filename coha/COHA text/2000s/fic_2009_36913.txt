1985 <p> Wendell Blackmon considered the dead dog lying before him and wiped his sweating brow with a white handkerchief pulled from his back pocket . He looked a bit incongruous producing the starched hanky , like a teamster holding up a pinky as he slurped coffee at the truck stop . He was a tall , broad-shouldered man with thinning brown hair and a full beard gone mostly white . He sported a nose that had profiled better before it was broken those three times . His creased forehead was high and getting higher as his hairline receded , and there were laugh lines at the corners of his blue eyes . The passage of the years had added a few extra pounds to his frame , and these had the effect of enhancing the sense of largeness that he projected . <p> The August afternoon was as humid as a rain forest and hotter than the sixth circle of hell . The weather report that morning had called for a near 100 percent chance of rain , locally heavy at times . Miniature dark clouds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the meteorologist had gravely advised her viewers to pack an umbrella in anticipation of the inevitability of precipitation . Wendell looked up at the cloudless blue sky and mentally declared another triumph for modern meteorology . He noted a mountain hawk hanging on the wind , floating effortlessly over the landscape . Its mournful kee kee came to his ears from what seemed a thousand miles away . <p> The weather woman had annoyed Wendell . In his opinion , his own mother , Eunice , had a better track record than any of the professional prognosticators , and her predictions did not rely on satellites , radar , or computers-a fact he believed may have enhanced her success rate . Her method was simple , a venerable system of forecasting that had been refined for millennia by the arthritic masses . If her elbow hurt , it was going to rain . If her knee hurt , too , it was going to rain a lot . If her elbow , knee , and hip-all three-hurt , then it was time to make peace with God because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was reliable 80 percent of the time , provided she stayed away from the aspirin bottle . Still , Heather McDowell of Channel Five Weather Alive did have nicer legs than Eunice 's , and maybe the poor girl would be fortunate enough to develop a good case of rheumatism over time . <p> " If you 've got straight teeth and can point , you are qualified , " Wendell had noted to his wife , Reva , over breakfast eggs and bacon . He was watching the weather report while she read the paper and paid scant attention to his monologue . His comment was an unfair generalization , anyway , since many of the practitioners of the trade also gestured with the backs of their hands , and a couple of the real old-timers used little batons , as if they were conducting an orchestra of meteorological events , a symphony of storm . " You can be wrong every time , and you still get paid , " he continued as he pointed his fork at the television on the kitchen counter . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lose . " Reva poured herself a little more coffee and turned the page . They had been married for over forty years , and she had pretty much heard it all before . Her husband 's gentle tirades against the real and imagined insults of the world were the background noise of her existence , always humming just outside the borders of her perception . <p> Weather people were not even really the problem , although in his later years , Wendell had come to view himself as a trace underemployed , a smidge below maximum potential , and he tended to grow touchy when mulling trades he felt to be better , or at least easier , than his own . As a humble policeman in Sand Valley , Alabama , he felt that category included many occupations . Maybe not coal mining or steel working , but certainly a large group of others . The real issue with Wendell was a general , vague dissatisfaction with almost everything , a mildly negative outlook on the world that was coupled with a quiet , nagging yearning for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him later in life , and he often wondered if he was alone in this unidentified feeling of emptiness and loss . Certainly his wife , Reva , seemed immune and took each day as it came , happy as a sailor in a liberty port to be drawing breath and seeing another sunrise . The last time they had discussed their different points of view was on the occasion of Wendell 's fiftieth birthday , a day that dawned dark and rainy and matched his mood to a tee . <p> " Being fifty really sucks , " he had noted . It was going on noon , he had been up for several hours , and these were his first words of the day . He had contemplated the phrase since early morning , had crafted and honed it in his mind , and it said exactly what he wanted to say . <p> " Why ca n't you be happy ? " Reva had asked . " You used to be . " They sat on the front porch and watched rain drip from the leaves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree were not friends . He claimed it was the only tree in the world that shed something each and every day of the year . Even on the only day in living memory that nothing had fallen off the tree , a bird had dropped dead from a branch , thus continuing the unbroken record . The magnolia had been planted by their neighbor , Miss Rose Lowery , when she was seven , and now she and her tree were both over ninety . The tree was drooping and had been losing branches with increasing regularity , and its occasional few blooms were more mottled brown than white . Miss Rose , on the other hand , was still as spry as a girl of seventy , and nothing major had fallen off of her in a long time , so it looked like she might outlast her tree . If the current drought extended another year , it was almost a certainty . <p> " I really do n't know , " Wendell had replied with a sigh to his wife . He was a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay , but the harder he tried , the less it rang true . " I want to be as happy as a fat pig in deep mud , but it just is n't there . I 'm not unhappy . I 'm just not happy . There is always a feeling in the back of my head that I 'm missing something , that the party has started and my invitation got lost in the mail . " In Wendell 's view , given the state of the postal service in recent years , this was entirely possible . " Maybe it 's the job , or maybe it 's Sand Valley , or maybe it 's just me . I remember being content when we lived in Seattle . " <p> " There is no party , and this is not a dress rehearsal , " Reva pointed out . She took his hand . " It does n't matter where we live , as long as we are there together . And a job is a job . This is the real thing . We are both on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to stand still . Eventually , it will all be over for us . First one of us and then the other will pass on from this world . My mama died young , so it will probably be me that goes first . But you know what I believe , and I 'll say it again . I am sure that I have loved you over many lifetimes , but I think that this will be my last time through this world . I hope that we are going to be together for whatever is next , but if you do n't quit dragging around this baggage , I do n't honestly believe it 's going to happen . If you do n't find some peace in this life , you will have to come back and look for it again in the next . And I do n't want to go on without you . " <p> Reva 's vivid dreams of what she believed to be her past lives with Wendell were at the core of her belief system . She had experienced them for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood what they signified until she 'd met her husband . She did not know why , but she always seemed to dream of just the endings of those lives , as if the imprint of the conclusion of one existence could carry over to the next and somehow burn itself onto that new consciousness . <p> In one dream , she and her fellow villagers were corralled by Roman soldiers at the edge of a cliff by the sea , and there was no escape . When awake , she believed the setting to be a rocky coast on the Irish Sea , but in her dreams she was not sure . The women fought savagely and well beside the men , with faces painted in blues and grays , but the Romans were too numerous and well equipped . As the end neared , the man who had battled the entire time by her side threw his axe at a Roman , cleaving the soldier 's shield and the arm that held it . Then he turned his back to their enemies and placed himself between her and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spoke to her in a language that her modern mind did not understand , although in her dream she knew what the words meant . Then , together , they stepped off the precipice . Reva knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that those two ill-fated lovers were previous incarnations of Wendell and herself . She had experienced the dream dozens of times , and each time she replayed the episode , a new fact or image was revealed . The first time she had viewed the scene was when she was six , long before she knew what a Roman was , or where the Irish Sea was located . Every time she had the dream , she awoke feeling sad on one hand and deeply peaceful on the other . <p> There were many other dreams as well . Some were frequent , some were occasional , and some were one of a kind . But they all had as their subject matter the ending of a relationship between the same two people . The appearance of the characters differed from one recollection to the next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces of Wendell and Reva Blackmon that were bidding farewell to one another . The adieu was the constant . Sometimes both were passing away , while other times it was one or the other . In one of her saddest and most vivid dreams , she was riding in a freight car . She knew it was a prison train of some type , and in her waking hours she always assumed that her dream persona was on the way to a penal camp in the vastness of Siberia . It was bitter cold , and she did not have sufficient clothing , so she was suffering from pneumonia while slowly freezing to death . The odor in the car was a mixture of rotted hay and hopeless humanity . She was an old woman who had been alone all her life , and she wanted to die and be out of her misery , but she could not . Her heart would not stop beating , and her life force simply would not let go . Then the train stopped , and more prisoners were punched and kicked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clubs . Included in this influx was an old man who appeared to be a farmer . He sat next to her just as she began to have a coughing fit . Without a word , he stood , removed his greatcoat , and wrapped her in it . Then he sat back down , encircled her frail form with his large arms , and tried to warm her as best he could . As the thump-thump of the rails passed beneath them , he held her , quietly singing an unfamiliar tune while gently rocking her . He continued this comfort until she died . The dream always made her sad , because she knew that in that particular life , they had almost not found each other and had missed much happiness in their individual isolations . But the dream also encouraged her because they had , in fact , discovered each other before the end . <p> " Thanks for cheering me up , " Wendell had said , back on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday . Reva had just informed him that from a cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just what to say to make me feel better . You 're going to die young , and I am going to come back as a barnacle . It does n't get much better than that . Excuse me while I go sit in the highway . Maybe a chicken truck will come along and put me out of my misery . " <p> " I am serious , " she replied . <p> " I know you 're serious , babe , " he offered . " Maybe I 'm in better shape than you think , and I could be your dog . " <p> " This is n't funny , " she had told him . It was Reva 's belief that the soul went through many incarnations before purifying itself enough to pass to a higher state of existence . The concepts were called the samsara , the continuing cycle of birth , life , death , and rebirth , which formed the core of many Hindu beliefs , and the moksha , the release from the earthly plane for those souls ready for oneness with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she 'd known their names or realized their Hindu origins . Hers was admittedly an unusual belief system to be held by a good , solid Methodist who sang in the choir on Wednesdays and Sundays , but she did not consider the two views to be mutually exclusive . The Methodist pastor , Dr. Stephen Rideout , was not as liberal as his parishioner , however , as was indicated by the " Hinduism or Heaven ? " sermon that he dusted off from time to time , whenever Reva became too vocal with her arcane philosophies . <p> But Dr. Rideout 's narrow-mindedness did not bother her in the least . She knew what she knew , and she believed what she believed . It was a certainty in her heart that this current life with Wendell represented her final trip through the earthly plane , and her great apprehension was that her husband was not yet ready for bigger and better things , cosmologically speaking . As with a child who could not learn his sums , her husband would flunk the great cosmic test and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's views on the state of his inner light , and he really could not mount an argument . She was happy , he was n't , and her explanation was at least as good as any of the others he had heard . It made as much sense as the fire and brimstone Christianity that he had been raised upon , and it was a more hopeful and forgiving system , given the fallible tendencies of the human race . While Wendell did n't buy into Reva 's convictions , he believed that she believed every word . And he wished that he did , too , because then he would believe in something definite , and more importantly , he would believe in something that he wanted with all of his heart to be true . <p> As for Wendell 's discontent , which Reva took as the major sign that his spirit needed seasoning , the matter had grown acute as he entered his fifties , as if he could hear the individual sands trickling through the hourglass , each one booming like cannon fire as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he eclipsed fifty-five , he found himself in the doldrums more often than not . He felt he was squandering his allotment of eternity , was spending his days on substandard merchandise . But he could see no cure for the dilemma . He had long ago learned to spot a lie , but he did not know how to discern the truth . He had spent his entire life attempting to decipher what he desired to be and do , but the only progress he had managed so far was to develop an ever-expanding list of what he did not want . <p> * * * <p> At the present moment , Wendell knew with certainty that he did not want to be the individual who had to ferret out the facts surrounding the apparently radical departure of the cur on the ground at his feet . The deceased canine was in shabby condition , but that was not entirely his fault . He was a German Shepherd , and he had come up on the short end of a dog fight , a sporting contest much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the loser was n't quite as tasty when served up with dumplings . Wendell looked at the dog 's owner , Deadhand Riley . He leaned up against his patrol car and watched as Deadhand fidgeted and scratched at his grizzled chest hair . It was coarse , tangled , and matted , like white steel wool . One of his overall straps came undone , and his nimble fingers re-buttoned it without any conscious assistance from their owner , who was busy at that moment attempting to look innocent . <p> " I 'm getting too old for this kind of shit , " Wendell noted to Deadhand . He spoke in a conversational tone . Wendell would be sixty in the fall , had been a policeman since he and Reva had relocated from Seattle to Sand Valley during the first year of John Kennedy 's reign , and was indeed getting too old for that kind of shit . Deadhand was caught short and did n't quite know what to say , so he compromised by nodding in agreement . <p> Opposite Deadhand stood Otter Price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otter looked as nervous as an apprentice firewalker and appeared to be contemplating the wisdom of becoming sullen , an avenue that represented one of his two favorite responses to authority . Historically , it had not been a particularly effective reaction , but it beat high-speed flight in his old Chevrolet , which was the other trick in his bag . He noticed the shadowy look on Wendell 's face and decided against trying either . Wendell usually sailed on a fairly even keel , but today he looked testy , and the Chevy needed a tune-up and two front tires before any swift roadwork could be seriously considered . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
