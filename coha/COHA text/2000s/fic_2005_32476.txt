Chapter One Punctuality is the mark of politeness . Florence Hartley , The Ladies ' Book of Etiquette , 1873 I had adjourned court a little early that bleak December afternoon after taking care of everything I could without a prosecutor ( the assistant DA had a late doctor 's appointment ) , but I 'd heard that the party outlet in Makely sold inexpensive wedding favors and , yeah , yeah , with less than two weeks till the big day , you 'd think I would have already taken care of every detail worth mentioning . Wrong . Having avoided it for this long , I was now so hooked on this whole wedding thing that I was like a junkie who needs just one more fix . Although my sisters-in-law did n't know it , what I planned to wear was already hidden in an empty closet at Aunt Zell 's house , along with my shoes , gloves , and the dark red velvet cloak that would ward off December 's chilly winds going to and from the First Baptist Church over in Dobbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my dark blond coloring was purely incidental . ) My bouquet had been ordered . The country club had been booked for a simple champagne reception , the gold band I would place on Dwight Bryant 's finger had been engraved and entrusted to Portland Brewer , my matron of honor , and when I left home that morning , I wascompletely caught up on all my thank-you notes . ( One good thing about a Christmas wedding is that greeting cards can do double duty . ) The only item lacking was the little bride and groom for the cake . And trust me , I do know they 're tacky and not exactly cutting edge , but my bossy , opinionated family would n't feel it was a real wedding cake if I only had rosebuds and ribbon icing . I 'd ordered a cake topper off the Internet-one in which the groom was dressed in a formal blue police uniform-but it still had n't come . Kate Bryant , Dwight 's artistic sister-in-law , had volunteered to paint the uniform brown like the one Dwight would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was going to need a couple of days to work her magic and one of my own sisters-in-law had suggested I might could find something suitable at the Makely store . " Sorry , " said the clerk . " You should have tried us back in the spring . " " Back in the spring , I did n't know I was going to need one , " I told her . At that point , I should have walked out of the store and headed straight back to Dobbs , but I saw so many cool stocking stuffers for my numerous nieces and nephews that I completely lost track of the time . It did n't help that traffic on the interstate was so backed up by an accident or something that I got off at the next exit and had to negotiate unfamiliar back roads . " Dammit , Deb'rah , where 've you been ? " growled my groom-to-be when I pulled into a slot in front of his apartment well after dark and nearly ninety minutes later than I 'd promised when we talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day I was born-he remembers it ; I don't-but until three months ago I 'd always thought of him as just another of my eleven older brothers . Surprised the hell out of me when pragmatic lust abruptly morphed into a romantic love as fiery and all-consuming as a Nora Roberts novel , especially when Dwight confessed that he 'd been hiding his true feelings for me behind his honorary-brother role for years . Does n't stop him from still yelling at me like one of my brothers , though . Bareheaded , no jacket , he was pacing back and forth on the windswept landing in front of his second-floor apartment when I got there , and he made it down the steps before I could get my keys out of the ignition . I tried to explain about court finishing early and how I then got sidetracked by Christmas shopping and after that , the traffic so that-He did n't want to hear it . " And you could n't call ? Or remember to switch your phone on so I could call you ? " I admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my robe , which was now hanging in an office at the Makely courthouse , but he caught me in his arms and held me tightly against him as if to make sure that I was whole and unharmed . For such a big guy , he can be surprisingly gentle . His hands and cheeks were like ice . Felt good , though , and my body started to throb and buzz until I realized that part of the vibration came from the cell phone hooked on his belt . With one arm still around me , he unclipped the phone , checked to see who it was , and said , " Yeah , Faye ? " I did n't hear what the dispatcher was saying , but there was nothing ambiguous about his reply . " Tell them to disregard that BOLO . She 's here now . " I could n't believe it . He 'd done a be-on-the-lookout for me ? I twisted away from his arm , grabbed the small bag of groceries from the front seat of my car , and stormed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncalled for , " I said angrily , when Dwight finally followed me inside . I had flung my coat across the back of his couch and now I was slamming cupboard doors as I pulled out pots and pans . " I have n't accounted to anyone since I was eighteen , " I told him , " and I 'll be damned if I 'm going to start toeing some imaginary mark now just because we 're getting married . " He closed the door quietly against the chill December night and stood there white-faced , staring at me , until I finally realized that he had probably spent the past hour remembering how close I came to dying the last time I did n't answer my cell phone for five hours . I let go of my anger and went to him . " Hey , " I said softly , standing on tiptoe to brush his lips with mine . " Nothing 's going to happen to me ever again . I 'm going to be here safe and sound for the rest of your life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap , okay ? " " I wish to God I could , " he said and kissed me with such vehemence that I knew something bad had happened . " What is it ? " I asked . " What else did Faye tell you ? " " That traffic backup you ran into on the interstate just now ? It was Tracy Johnson . She smashed into an overpass . " " What ? Is she okay ? " He shook his head . " Sounds like she died instantly . " I stood there with my mouth open . Brisk , efficient Tracy Johnson ? The tall and slender ADA who loves high heels as much as I do and who tries to hide her beauty and brains behind the ugliest pair of horn-rim glasses in eastern North Carolina ? Impossible ! " I just saw her , " I protested . " She prosecuted today 's calendar . " " I 'm sorry , shug , " he said . " What about Mei ? " I asked . " Tracy left court early because Mei had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was in the car , too . They 're going to air-vac her to Chapel Hill , but it does n't sound good . " Three years ago , Tracy got tired of waiting around for a man who was n't intimidated by her height or her mind and decided to adopt from China . It had taken her two years to complete all the paperwork , and she was utterly besotted by the baby , who was just beginning to walk and talk . Portland and I and some of the women from the DA 's office had given her a shower once the adoption went through . She was a few years younger and we were never hugely close , but I did respect her . She was an excellent prosecutor , efficient , prepared , and fairer than most who just want the win , no matter what . " Does Doug know ? " I asked . Doug Woodall is our district attorney and Tracy 's boss . " Doubt it , " Dwight said . " They just ID 'd her and family takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure . I know her parents are dead , but I think she has a sister or brother over in Widdington . Or maybe it was a cousin that came to her shower when she brought Mei home from China this spring . " Tears spilled down my cheeks and my heart was sore just thinking about that poor little baby . Unwanted by her birth mother , now she 'd lost the adoptive mother who adored her . What would happen to her ? Dwight 's cell phone buzzed again . " Yeah , Faye ? " His face went even grimmer as he listened , then he said , " Give me the coordinates again . And call Jamison and Denning . Tell them to meet me there . " Jack Jamison 's one of the new detectives he 's training and Percy Denning is Colleton County 's crime scene specialist . " What now ? " I asked as he holstered his gun and reached for the heavy winter jacket hanging on a peg by the door . " The wreck was n't an accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . " " Shot ? " All sorts of wild possibilities tumbled through my mind . I tried to think what was in season now . " Tracy died because some dumb hunter was n't paying attention ? " Dwight shrugged . " The ROs say it looks like a deliberate act . " ROs-responding officers . " Why ? " " Wo n't know till I get there , shug . " He zipped his jacket , gave me a quick kiss and was gone .
