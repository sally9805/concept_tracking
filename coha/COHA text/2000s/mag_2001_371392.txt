Another op'nin ' , another show , " sings the cast at the start of Kiss Me , Kate , but the Broadway revival was another show a-closin ' in the days that followed Sept. 11 . Even after the unions agreed to a 25% pay cut to keep ailing Broadway shows alive , Kate 's producers still could n't see a way to continue . Then a stagehand came up with a **28;13817;TOOLONG idea : if the cast and crew would voluntarily give up another 25% of their pay for four weeks and use the money to buy tickets for fire fighters and other rescue workers , the show could stay afloat . <P> Applause , curtain call , happy ending , right ? Wait  --  there may be an Act III . True , Kiss Me , Kate and most other Broadway shows have bounced back smartly since that plunge in attendance following the World Trade Center attacks .

The frothy musical , built around the songs of the hugely popular ( and critically patronized ) ' 70s Swedish rock group Abba , was created to bring happiness wherever it goes  --  and so far it has . The show has been a sellout in London since it opened there 2 1/2 years ago , and it has broken box-office records almost everywhere else it has played , including Toronto , Los Angeles and Boston . Despite the hard times , Mamma Mia ! opened last week on Broadway with a $27 million advance sale , reportedly the second highest in history . <P> Even in the pre-Sept. 11 world , this silly confection , about a 20-year-old bride-to-be who invites three of her mother 's ex-boyfriends to her wedding on a Greek island so she can find out which one is her father , was an escapist trifle .
