Tufa You woke me with laughter . I was dreaming of fish . But you were letting out peals of laughter , already wide awake . The bedsheets were tangled in your hands and pressed to your face to stifle the sounds . I turned to you . I said in my morning voice , What 's so funny ? You looked at me plaintively , still full of laughs , your hair tousled and tangled from rolling in bed . You had all the covers . You said , I do n't know . I ca n't remember . That was how I woke , how you used to wake me . It was early morning when I left . Late September . The trees were trying to flirt with every color they could muster : orange , brown , yellow , crimson , rust . The knots of the trees had come alive , wooing the breeze with open-mouthed kisses . On the ground , the fallen leaves were a soft kilim of crinkling sheets , veils promising nudity , even hinting misleadingly of sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeding them the nutrients you mixed into the water as if you were making a broth . The night before , you 'd looked at me screw-eyed , and warned : In the morning , slip out . Write , do n't call . Or wire flowers every once in a while to surprise me . Everyone likes flowers , and it does n't matter which kinds . Besides you pointed to a jar of peonies on the table these ones are dying . No , no , I told you , they 're just distracted . The trip was hard . ( It was hard even before I got started . The bare skin of your shoulder attracted my hand in the morning , and I kissed you goodbyelike they teach in the movies . Then as I lumbered out , weighted down by my bags , you tried to ignore me , quietly crying . ) I flew to Amsterdam , and then to Rome , and then again to Bari , in a rickety Fokker 27 that actually shook . In Bari , we were supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were notices of an outbreak of cholera , and murmurs of the irony of dehydration so close to the sea . The old port of the city was full of old disease . It made me wince to see people clutching their stomachs from cramps , staring back at me from pools of diarrhea . Dr Stoppani met us at the airport , and we spent the night at his home , watching the news reports on TV , as he translated to us whatever details we missed : a seventy-year-old fisherman , wanting to prove his catch was safe , had gulped down a bowl of mussels on camera , and the networks were showing the footage over and over , because now this fisherman was dead . His widow had become something of a celebrity , granting interviews in her slippers from the door to their ramshackle home on the town 's northern edge , by the frazione of Santo Spirito . She carried a framed photograph of her husband in her hand , and wanted to know who was going to support her . That evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed had been flown in from the north . This is Mediterranean fish , Ligurian fish , Monica Stoppani said , in an accent that showed her English was studied , and not just learned . She was an elegant woman , refined . She wore jewelry . This is red mullet from Portofino , she said . So it is quite all right . My wife is beautiful , Dr Stoppani told us after dinner , as if to make sure we realized it . And she is charming , he added , implying a degree of cause and effect . In the morning , we headed inland by car , threading south through the valleys on the barely trafficked roads that lead the way to the city of Mancanzano . There were five of us : Dr Stoppani , Middelhoek , Fortune , Linda and me , in three beat-up Fiats , carrying our luggage and equipment , rumbling past the dry range in a caravan of creaking chassis . Middelhoek went on and on about petitioning the Ministry of Transportation to have the roads repaved , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been pulling out of his breast pocket ever since joining up with us at Schiphol Airport . But now , three hours outside of Bari , one crevice was so huge that it was more like a fissure , and a wheel of Fortune 's Fiat got stuck . We had to tow out his car the most heavily weighted down of the bunch thanks to two taped-up steamer trunks on top by unfastening the baggage from the roofs of our own cars , just so that we could use the rope . It 's a good thing I 'd practiced driving a stick shift with you before I left New York . I turned up the radio when the gear-grinding got bad . The air already smelled burned . When I stuck my arm through the window , I could feel the heat from the air on the flanks of the car whenever my skin touched against metal . It 's picturesque to imagine all of us decked out in desert clothes , drinking from lozenge , shaped , dented , canvas-wrapped canteens : a regular expedition into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen suit , and , halfway through the trip , he brought out a box of individually wrapped almond cakes and a Thermos of lukewarm espresso that he poured into porcelain cups . Linda , at least , had put on a pair of khakis , and she sipped from a bottle of mineral water with a half-detached label that hung by her wrist . Just as she finished drinking , she glanced around at the empty landscape , and , much like Ozymandias surveying his kingdom , said , I hope this does n't make me have to pee . Because there 's no place to go . But we got there , all right . We saw Mancanzano rise right out of the dust , like some Italianate Oz . In order to describe what it 's like here , I 'd better start with the winds . This time of the year , they hit you in the face just to surprise you . Then they loiter around the back of your neck , like a pack of punks , before ducking inside your collar to perpetrate even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like they 're sucked from the earth . They make you sweat . Then they give you the chills . Until you get used to them , you walk around feeling like your skin is somebody else 's . The more you perspire , the more the dust clings to you , eventually mining to crust . Just outside of town , there 's a ravine with a creek that the Mancanzani visit , where they stick their bodies for as long as they can . We 've only been here for a week , and already we 've joined them , even if Fortune 's still having trouble communicating with the townsfolk in his English-schoolboy Italian . Sometimes there 'll be six or seven of us in the creek , stripped down to our underwear , lying in two feet of water . When it gets crowded , you stand up with pebbles still pressed to your skin . Then you brush them off , and the little red indentations turn white , and then smooth , and then hot like the rest of your body . Dr Stoppani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always well regarded in Mancanzano . Doing it more than once a day is generally considered so slothful and indolent that people eye you warily when you pass them on the street . You can tell what they 're thinking , Dr Stoppani says . They 're thinking : There goes the guy who ca n't take the heat . There are vast patches of rock all along the outskirts of the city . It 's the stone that I told you about before I left : a calcium carbonate called tufa , the texture and color of sand . Where the tufa breaks through the earth , the terrain is covered with mottled tapestries of white , black , yellow , orange and rust . ( They 're almost the same colors I remember from autumn with you , transported and transmogrified . ) In some remote places , pebbles give way to rocks the size of fists , which then turn to boulders , before finally the whole ground transforms to broad sheets of stone . Where the tufa 's been disturbed by any one of the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fossils of Pleistocene seashells ripple across the rock . I 've seen kids digging with bare hands , with monstrous calluses on their fingertips , bulging just below hardened nails . It boosts your ego to say you tore the ground apart with your hands . From what we 've been told , the Mancanzano women say these guys are rough , and , yes , sometimes the guys even hurt them , but in a land where people are hardened by sun and wind , what frightens them most is n't the prospect of pain , but the absence of sensation . But I do n't know how you could be dulled to anything here . The air is full of the scent of thyme , and thistles mix with rosemary , sage and flowering asphodel . Wild asparagus sprouts unpredictably , yards away from bloating cactus . There are a few ash and olive trees folded into the thorn bushes that are home to maybe a few nose-twitching hares . There are some fig trees too , with swollen fruits draped from their branches like Christmas tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings to the ground , groping for cracks where it might unassumingly shoot its roots , snails appear by the thousand , sharing the terrain with darting squadrons of lizards . They get in your boots . Here in the city , mixed into the disarray , there are eccentric homes built from the tufa . These are the cave homes that the Mancanzani call sassi ( even if the word ambiguously only means stones in dictionary Italian ) . In the oldest parts of the city , the sassi are set off by tiny piazzas , layered one on top of another , and tangled along the face of two giant bluffs . Here , Mancanzano is all one intricate web : houses fold into each other like a distended urban origami , as the roof of one becomes another 's floor , or a walled-in courtyard , or a neighborhood 's sidewalk . Faades have been added to the fronts of some homes , but so much of Mancanzano is actually just an arabesque of grottoes . At night , it 's easy to see which of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling tenebrous streets with an eerie glow . For hundreds of years , the people here used a system of cisterns carved into the rock to collect rainwater . God and gravity were all the town 's inhabitants knew about modern plumbing . But then the same southern winds blew radio and television signals into town , and Mancanzano had to start playing catch-up with the rest of the country . Today , the Mancanzani are still laborers and farmers , but they are also bankers and architects who can languorously quote Gramsci and Proust . Sometimes you see a guy in a well-tailored suit , short slicked-back hair and callused hands . Then you think : this is not a man to be trifled with . Sometimes you see these men , and the women too , at the creek after nightfall , ties and pants and jackets and skirts folded over the stones , and a half-dozen barely clothed bankers lying still in cold water , remembering what it was like to be six years old , before money and government and religion and sex . Sometimes it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever skin you can bare against the porous , cool stone . It 's a sign of great hospitality , here : offering a wall of your home against which a guest can pull up his shirt and press sweaty skin . Just short of that , what people do to keep cool when they 're away from the creek is they cover themselves up with powdered tufa . They really let it soak up the sweat . The day we arrived in Mancanzano , we visited our local contact , the High Deputy for Public Works , at her modern hilltop home . La Dottoressa Donabuoni is a woman in her mid-fifties , cultivated in dress , bur with the exaggerated femininity of a gnome doped up on estrogen . She 's what the Italians call a donna prosperosa , a woman whose prosperity is measured by the voluptuousness of her breast . That afternoon in her living room , as we sipped glasses of sweetened iced tea , we all watched intently as she took a handful of tufa from a basin and sprinkled it down the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she offered me a conspiratorial glance . And later that week , when I visited her office to discuss an ongoing matter of permits , I saw that she had a small ceramic jar of powdered tufa on her desk . I could barely get out a word before she reached across the giant slab of mahogany to hold the container before me . Then she dabbed a powdery finger at her cleavage , as you might a perfume . I put a few fingerfuls along my neck , which tingled to the touch . So what am I doing in this funky spelunky southern Italian town anyway , lodged like a pebble in the instep of the Italian boot ? And what am I doing here in Mancanzano , when I keep thinking of you five thousand miles away in New York ? We all have Dr Stoppani to thank . He 's the one who put our team together in the midst of all the commotion here , contacting a handful of universities in northern Europe and the United States to offer positions that no one in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London , was the first one to sign on to our group . He 's been taking samples of the tufa deposits around Mancanzano 's outskirts since we arrived , and already he 's got a team of locals helping him : a ragtag bunch of kids from the liceo scientifico here , whom you catch holding hands exactly when they think you 're not looking . Joost Middelhoek , a curator at the Rijksmuseum 's largely neglected Italian collection ( not to mention a graduate of the Netherlands State Training School for Restorers , where he claims he showed unparalleled aptitude at differentiating among the chemical properties of yellows and blues ) , is focusing his attention on the underground frescoes , the ones that the police and those other kids found . Middelhoek 's job is to gauge what damage there 's been to the wall paintings thus far , and he 's collaborating with those do-nothings from the Centro per la Valorizzazione e Gestione delle Risorse Storico-Ambientali , two and a half hours away in Potenza , whenever the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , as our team 's two American cultural anthropologists ( and the only ones to know one another before coming here ) are sticking above ground , traipsing across Mancanzano 's narrow streets with a six-page penciled-in , crossed-out map , knocking on doors and gathering stories . Our goal is to get as many oral histories as we can onto tape , so that at least we 'll have something if everything everyone else does amounts to a hill of fagioli . Now that we 're all here , it 's not clear what Dr Stoppani does himself . Every few days he gets in his car and drives like a madman in the direction of Bari . He comes back in the morning , just as the sun 's up , looking a lot like an exhausted teenager . But I tell you , it 's amazing they want to tear all of this down , hide away the history just because of the deaths . Essentially , Mancanzano 's modern history began in the sixth century AD with the monks . They were Benedictines fleeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently chose Mancanzano because they could n't imagine anyone following them to so miserable a place as this abandoned cave town . With its arid landscape , dusty hills and remarkably few natural resources , the warren-like sassi would finally provide them with the insularity they craved . Plagues , earthquakes and famine had wiped out the town 's earlier inhabitants . So once the Benedictines arrived , they got to work . They dug gargantuan monasteries and churches into the tufa bluffs , excavating apses and altars , columns and naves . They chiseled vaulted ceilings and cubbyholes the shapes of enormous sunken teardrops , then they covered the chalky subterranean walls with frescoes of vibrant peaches and blues . Angels showed up suddenly , inscribed in the dust . Smaller grottoes that had served as homes since Paleolithic times were further transformed into chapels , now connected by tunnels . The work turned the interior landscape into an even more beguiling labyrinth . But not even the Benedictines would remain . In the fifteenth century , the riches and excesses of the Renaissance slowly seeped south , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Fra Filippo Lippi ( a Carmelite monk who 'd been so debauched as to marry and father a son ) , Mancanzano 's monks could n't help wonder why they were still living in caves , traveling their underground metropolis like obeisant armies of worker ants . So the monks , in turn , abandoned the cave churches they 'd dug into stone , and they disappeared into the neighboring open-air towns , establishing a confetti of churches and chapels across Italy 's south . Soon a new wave of farmers took the monks ' places , inhabiting the rock monasteries along with their livestock , herding their cattle against the frescoes , teaching chickens and pigs , and even themselves , how to live inside caves . Within the chapels , they constructed giant stone vats for stomping out wine , storing caches of their product in the cool , sunken recesses . Five hundred years ago long before our own ancestors were born , I think the inhabitants of Mancanzano reveled underground , drunk like stone skunks on their cavern wine . But if this starts to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ) , you have to keep it all in perspective . Farmers feel rich if there 's milk on the table and a little meat on the fire . Whereas in more urbane environments , such as those found closer to Rome , there has been the tendency to feel rich if you have the right shoes and political connections . By the 1930s , Mancanzano 's caves came to symbolize southern Italy 's extreme indigence . Here , poverty was classified by how far into the earth 's bowels you were willing to live . There were troglodyte Mancanzani called Ventimetri because they lived twenty meters from open air . There were Trentametri and Quarantametri too . If the size of your home was a measure of your patience of how long and how deep you were willing to dig then there were families of ten and more crammed into twenty-square-meter spaces . The members would curl into balls at night just to make enough room for sleep . Halfway through this century , when Carlo Levi 's memoir Christ Stopped at Eboli suggested that humanity had n't reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians lived as wild animals or beasts of burden , Mancanzano had acquired the nickname Mole City . But amid well-publicized newspaper reports of its poverty and squalor ( some accompanied by photos of black clouds of flies over mounds of garbage ) , the well-coiffed plutocrats of Rome began to declare the city responsible for an unacceptable ill and this one abominable in an age of mass communication : publicly exemplifying their country 's worst . As Dr Stoppani tells it , indignant legislators across the capital announced : It 's a scandal the people of Mancanzano live this way . So let 's not let them . Not even the town 's once-legendary frescoes could save Mancanzano , for over the years they had n't fared any better than the people . Where livestock had been herded into the sassi and where human beings had driven in nails , chiseled shelves , and cooked over fires without so much as a chimney the Benedictine cave paintings were so badly damaged that there was n't much anyone considered worth saving . Smoke from olive branches and meats had permeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnished frescoes once painted to praise God , virgins , angels and saints now looked as if they were ducking back into the stone , reburying themselves in the womb of the soft rock . By some people 's reckoning , it was as though the angels had congressed and decided that Mancanzano 's caves were no longer a safe place for miracles . Which might have been right . Because by then Italy was under the churn of Fascism . In 1937 , fifteen years after Mussolini took power , Rome officially declared the caves of Mancanzano a vergogna nazionale , a national embarrassment that belittled the spirit of Fascism 's copious public works . So Il Duce decreed that the cave homes would be razed and replaced with modern monolithic structures . Soldiers were dispatched to Mancanzano with orders to give the twenty thousand cave-dwellers four days to move , but few of the soldiers wanted to linger that long ; so they gave the town 's peasants just six hours to decide where to go next . Mussolini 's Italy was caught up in ideas of modernism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burrowing into a hillside . The soldiers also could n't comprehend the cult of tufa , which the local Mancanzani believed then to have medicinal and even magical properties . The townsfolk would mix the powdered stone into their food , as though they were sprinkling on dietary supplements , or , better yet , freshly grated cheese . If you were n't used to eating the powdered tufa , its taste and consistency made you gag . If you poured too much of the tufa into your food ( or , perhaps , into the food of a visiting soldier who had just thrust a jackboot through your door ) , it turned from powder to paste , and then to cement . It could harden on your plate . Or in your stomach . At the end of three hours in Mancanzano on April 19 , 1937 , a half-dozen of Mussolini 's troops were clutching their abdomens . But after three hours more it was by then five o'clock , and southern Italy 's sun cast fractured shadows across the sprawling sassi the ambulatory Fascisti fired shots into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through flesh and stone , splashing blood and drilling deep into the tufa . According to orders , tents for the displaced townspeople were to have been put up on Mancanzano 's outskirts , but the soldiers had chosen to wait until the late afternoon to erect them , once the sun was n't so hot . So into the evening , the weeping , and now homeless , Mancanzani sat around , consoling each other and rebundling their belongings , as they waited for the awkward favelas to go up . The construction was finished just before midnight . But the tents came down the following morning , just as soon as it rained . Over the next few months , two new neighborhoods were tacked on to Mancanzano 's flatland periphery by an army corps of engineers . But as the war effort mounted , their energies were needed elsewhere , and most of the buildings remained half built , with beams jutting out into the still air . Some Mancanzani moved back to the caves despite warnings , lodging in the deepest tunnels and emerging at night on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fascisti accomplished , besides killing a few hundred people , was to create an atmosphere of lawlessness among those who remained . But Mussolini 's men had other worries by then . In 1939 , Il Duce signed on with Hitler , and in 1940 Italy entered the war in Europe . So the remaining troops left Mancanzano to face more pressing challenges beyond Italy 's borders . After all , now there were Ethiopia , Albania , Yugoslavia and Greece to menace . Back in Mancanzano , where soldiers had sprayed bullets with the nonchalance of gardeners spraying weedkiller across lawns , the tufa had absorbed the blood , and the walls and doorframes of the cave homes were permanently stained red . Over the next two decades most of the sassi remained empty , even once the Fascisti were gone . No one wanted to live in a place that so inescapably reminded him of death . By the late 1960s , the sassi were still predominantly uninhabited , and they became havens for late-night parties , cultish rituals , and sometimes both . The maze-like caves attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woo whichever girlfriends responded well to this kind of wooing . In the process , they littered the grounds with wine bottles , candles , magazines and condoms . Although the furniture from the homes had long since been removed , there were still some mattresses scattered throughout , and many of them had been pushed into the corners of the oblong rooms . The mattresses were tattered and worn , and consumed in a mildew that masked the dank smell of sex . Decades of wine and sweat had soaked into the cottony fiber . So , when the carabinieri found the two missing teenagers just those six weeks ago , they saw what I told you even before I left . Both the boy and the girl were sprawled across the cave floor , naked . There was no sign of their clothes anywhere in the nearby sassi or interlocking runnels , and , given the far-from-impressive caliber of local forensics , it was virtually impossible to determine what route the teenagers had taken through the labyrinth of the city to get to these particular caves .
