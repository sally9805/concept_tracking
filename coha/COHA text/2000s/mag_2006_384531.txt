. Use plastic or pork trailers to jazz up your fishing lure . Lures that wiggle and wobble through the water are usually all it takes to draw a strike , but sometimes fish need a bit more encouragement before they 'll commit . That 's where trailers added to the rear end of a lure come in handy . Trailers made of plastic or a natural material such as pork rind or chamois can close the deal on fish that are n't aggressive . Here are some ways to get the most from these added attractions . KEEP IT IN PLACE Add a touch of quick-drying glue to the hook just before setting a plastic trailer into position to prevent it from sliding around the hook bend on retrieve . ATTACH WITH EASE Use a split ring and a snap that opens at both ends ( such as a DuoLock , Cross-Lok or Norman Speed Clip ) to attach a spinner blade to any lure . Willow-leaf , Indiana or Colorado blades can be used . Attach one end of the double-end snap to the spinner blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the snap to the split ring and hook . The split ring can be fitted over the hook point and slid down the bend , where it 's kept securely in place by a small chunk of discarded soft-plastic bait . GET FANCY Gussy up a pork or plastic trailer by using a large yarn needle to thread colored yarn ( red is good ) through the body . Tiny rattles also can be attached to a trailer . SLAP LEATHER Strips of thin cham ois cut from an old polishing rag can serve double duty as trailers . Pierce the head end with a hook point to attach it in place . PICK ANY LURE Add trailers to lures such as topwater plugs and underwater crankbaits . The best lure choices are those that have a tail hook , as opposed to a hook attached to the rear belly of the plug . ( Attaching a trailer to a belly hook will dampen the lure action . ) Choices include removing the standard treble hook and replacing it with a dressed tail such as the Storm FlashTail hook ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flash ) , or Owner Tournament Trailers ( feathers and Mylar flash ) . Most are available in sizes 8 through 2 . BOX TANDEM-RIGGED TRAILER LURES Trailers , Texas-rigged with a hook , are ideal as a tandem lure retrieved behind topwater lures or even crankbaits , weedless spoons or jigs . * Use a 12- to 18-inch leader of monofilament of a breaking strength slightly less than that of the fishing line . This might keep you from losing the main lure in case the trailer hangs up . * Tie the mono to the trailer hook with an improved clinch knot , then tie the other end to the rear screw eye of a plug , or the bend of the hook on a spoon , spinnerbait , buzzbait or jig . * Use a trailer as light as possible to prevent it from interfering with the action of the main lure . BOX A QUICK FIX FOR SHORT STRIKERS When fish just grab at the tail end of a lure , a trailer hook will improve your catch rate . * Just slip the eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lure 's hook , than slide it down to the bend . * A small piece of plastic worm or rubber tab will hold a trailer hook in place . Single stinger hooks are particularly effective on spinnerbaits and buzzbaits. * Lindy makes a pre-rigged stinger treble hook ( shown below ) . The eye is covered with a rubberized material to keep it in place . Packaged in pairs , the treble stingers cost less than a buck apiece .  --  Colin Moore Author Affiliation <p>                     @x Billy Litchfield strolled by One Fifth at least twice a day . He once had a dog , a Wheaten terrier , that had been given to him by Mrs. Houghton , who had raised Wheaten terriers on her estate on the Hudson . Wheaty had required two outings a day to the dog run in Washington Square Park , and Billy , who lived on Fifth Avenue just north of One Fifth , had developed the habit then of walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One Fifth was one of his personal landmarks , a magnificent building constructed of a pale gray stone in the classic lines of the art deco era , and Billy , who had one foot in the new millennium and one foot in the cafT society of lore , had always admired it . " It should n't matter where you live as long as where you live is decent , " he said to himself , but still , he aspired to live in One Fifth . He had aspired to live there for thirty-five years and had yet to make it . <p> For a short time , Billy had decided that aspiration was dead , or at least out of favor . This was just after 9/11 , when the cynicism and shallowness that had beaten through the lifeblood of the city was interpreted as unnecessary cruelty , and it was all at once tacky to wish for anything other than world peace , and tacky not to appreciate what one had . But six years had passed , and like a racehorse , New York could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . While most of New York was in mourning , a secret society of bankers had brewed and stirred a giant cauldron of money , adding a dash of youth and computer technology , and voila , a whole new class of the obscenely super-rich was born . This was perhaps bad for America , but it was good for Billy . Although a self-declared anachronism , lacking the appurtenances of what might be called a regular job , Billy acted as a sort of concierge to the very rich and successful , making introductions to decorators , art dealers , club impresarios , and members of the boards of both cultural establishments and apartment buildings . In addition to a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of art and antiquities , Billy was well versed in the finer points of jets and yachts , knew who owned what , where to go on vacation , and which restaurants to frequent . <p> Billy had very little money of his own , however . Possessing the fine nature of an aristocrat , Billy was a snob , especially when it came to money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful , to be witty at dinner and house parties , to advise what to say and how best to spend money , but he drew the line at soiling his own hands in the pursuit of filthy lucre . <p> And so , while he longed to live at One Fifth Avenue , he could never raise the desire in himself to make that pact with the devil to sell his soul for money . He was content in his rent-stabilized apartment for which he paid eleven hundred dollars a month . He often reminded himself that one did n't actually need money when one had very rich friends . <p> Upon returning from the park , Billy usually felt soothed by the morning air . But on this particular morning in July , Billy was despondent . While in the park he had sat down on a bench with The New York Times and discovered that his beloved Mrs. Houghton had passed away the night before . During the thunderstorm three days ago , Mrs. Houghton had been left out in the rain for no more than ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia had set in , bringing her long life to a swift and speedy end and taking much of New York by surprise . Billy 's only consolation was that her obituary had appeared on the front page of the Times , which meant there were still one or two editors who remembered the traditions of a more refined age , when art mattered more than money , when one 's contribution to society was more important than showing off the toys of one 's wealth . <p> Thinking about Mrs. Houghton , Billy found himself lingering in front of One Fifth , staring up at the imposing facade . For years , One Fifth had been an unofficial club for successful artists of all kinds-the painters and writers and composers and conductors and actors and directors who possessed the creative energy that kept the city alive . Although not an artist herself , Mrs. Houghton , who had lived in the building since 1947 , had been the arts ' biggest patron , founding organizations and donating millions to art institutions both large and small . There were those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , the paparazzi apparently had decided a photograph of the building in which Mrs. Houghton had lived might be worth money , and had gathered in front of the entrance . As Billy took in the small group of photographers , badly dressed in misshapen T-shirts and jeans , his sensibilities were offended . Ali the best people are dead , he thought mournfully . <p> And then , since he was a New Yorker , his thoughts inevitably turned to real estate . What would happen to Mrs. Houghton 's apartment ? he wondered . Her children were in their seventies . Her grandchildren , he supposed , would sell it and take the cash , having denuded most of the Houghton fortune over the years , a fortune , like so many old New York fortunes , that turned out to be not quite as impressive as it had been in the seventies and eighties . In the seventies , a million dollars could buy you just about anything you wanted . Now it barely paid for a birthday party . <p> How New York had changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Houghton always said . " Money wants what it ca n't buy . Class and talent . And remember that while there 's a talent for making money , it takes real talent to know how to spend it . And that 's what you do so well , Billy . " <p> And now who would spend the money to buy the Houghton place ? It had n't been redecorated in at least twenty years , trapped in the chintz of the eighties . But the bones of the apartment were magnificent-and it was one of the grandest apartments in Manhattan , a proper triplex built for the original owner of One Fifth , which had once been a hotel . The apartment had twelve-foot ceilings and a ballroom with a marble fireplace , and wraparound terraces on all three floors . <p> Billy hoped it would n't be someone like the Brewers , although it probably would be . Despite the chintz , the apartment was worth at least twenty million dollars , and who could afford it except for one of the new hedge-funders ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bad . At least the wife , Connie , was a former ballet dancer and friend . The Brewers lived uptown and owned a hideous new house in the Hamptons where Billy was going for the weekend . He would tell Connie about the apartment and how he could smooth their entry with the head of the board , the extremely unpleasant Mindy Gooch . Billy had known Mindy " forever " - meaning from the mid-eighties , when he 'd met her at a party . She was Mindy Welch back then , fresh off the boat from Smith College . Full of brio , she was convinced she was about to become the next big thing in publishing . In the early nineties , she got herself engaged to James Gooch , who had just won a journalism award . Once again Mindy had had all kinds of grand schemes , picturing she and James as the city 's next power couple . But none of it had worked out as planned , and now Mindy and James were a middle-aged , middle-class couple with creative pretensions who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wondered how they 'd been able to buy in One Fifth in the first place . The unexpected and tragic early death of a parent , he guessed . <p> He stood a moment longer , wondering what the photographers were waiting for . Mrs. Houghton was dead and had passed away in the hospital . No one related to her was likely to come walking out ; there would n't even be the thrill of the body being taken away , zipped up in a body bag , as one sometimes saw in these buildings filled with old people . At that instant , however , none other than Mindy Gooch strolled out of the building . She was wearing jeans and those fuzzy slippers that people pretended were shoes and were in three years ago . She was shielding the face of a young teenaged boy as if afraid for his safety . The photographers ignored them . <p> " What is all this ? " she asked , spotting Billy and approaching him for a chat . <p> " I imagine it 's for Mrs. Houghton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " If you want to look at it that way , " Billy said . <p> " How else can one look at it ? " Mindy said . <p> " It 's that word ' finally , ' " Billy said . " It 's not nice . " <p> " Mom , " the boy said . <p> " This is my son , Sam , " Mindy said . <p> " Hello , Sam , " Billy said , shaking the boy 's hand . He was surprisingly attractive , with a mop of blond hair and dark eyes . " I did n't know you had a child , " Billy remarked . <p> " He 's thirteen , " Mindy said . " We 've had him quite a long time . " <p> Sam pulled away from her . <p> " Will you kiss me goodbye , please ? " Mindy said to her son . <p> " I 'm going to see you in , like , forty-eight hours , " Sam protested . <p> " Something could happen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Mom , please , " Sam said . But he relented . He kissed her on the cheek . <p> Mindy gazed at him as he ran across the street . " He 's that age , " she said to Billy . " He does n't want his mommy anymore . It 's terrible . " <p> Billy nodded cautiously . Mindy was one of those aggressive New York types , as tightly wound as two twisted pieces of rope . You never knew when the rope might unwind and hit you . That rope , Billy often thought , might even turn into a tornado . " I know exactly what you mean . " He sighed . <p> " Do you ? " she said , her eyes beaming in on him . There was a glassy look to les yeux , thought Billy . Perhaps she was on drugs . But in the next second , she calmed down and repeated , " So Mrs. Houghton 's finally dead . " <p> " Yes , " Billy said , slightly relieved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something came up this morning . " Mindy 's eyes narrowed . " Should be interesting to see who tries to buy the apartment . " <p> " A rich hedge-funder , I would imagine . " <p> " I hate them , do n't you ? " Mindy said . And without saying goodbye , she turned on her heel and walked abruptly away . <p> Billy shook his head and went home . <p> Mindy went to the deli around the corner . When she returned , the photographers were still on the sidewalk in front of One Fifth . Mindy was suddenly enraged by their presence . <p> " Roberto , " Mindy said , getting in the doorman 's face . " I want you to call the police . We need to get rid of those photographers . " <p> " Okay , Missus Mindy , " Roberto said . <p> " I mean it , Roberto . Have you noticed that there are more and more of these paparazzi types on the street lately ? " <p> " It 's because of all the celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about them . " <p> " Someone should do something , " Mindy said . " I 'm going to talk to the mayor about it . Next time I see him . If he can drum out smokers and trans fat , he can certainly do something about these hoodlum photographers . " <p> " He 'll be sure to listen to you , " Roberto said . <p> " You know , James and I do know him , " Mindy said . " The mayor . We 've known him for years . From before he was the mayor . " <p> " I 'll try to shoo them away , " Roberto said . " But it 's a free country . " <p> " Not anymore , " Mindy said . She walked past the elevator and opened the door to her ground-floor apartment . <p> The Gooches ' apartment was one of the oddest in the building , consisting of a string of rooms that had once been servants ' quarters and storage rooms . The apartment was an unwieldy shape of boxlike spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner psychosis of James and Mindy Gooch and shaping the psychology of their little family . Which could be summed up in one word : dysfunctional . <p> In the summer , the low-ceilinged rooms were hot ; in the winter , cold . The biggest room in the warren , the one they used as their living room , had a shallow fireplace . Mindy imagined it as a room once occupied by a majordomo , the head of all servants . Perhaps he had lured young female maids into his room and had sex with them . Perhaps he had been gay . And now , eighty years later , here she and James lived in those same quarters . It felt historically wrong . After years and years of pursuing the American dream , of aspirations and university educations and hard , hard work , all you got for your efforts these days were servants ' quarters in Manhattan . And being told you were lucky to have them . While upstairs , one of the grandest apartments in Manhattan was empty , waiting to be filled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared only about money and nothing about the good of the country or its people , who would live like a little king . In an apartment that morally should have been hers and James 's . <p> In a tiny room at the edge of the apartment , her husband , James , with his sweet balding head and messy blond comb-over , was pecking away mercilessly at his computer , working on his book , distracted and believing , as always , that he was on the edge of failure . Of all his feelings , this edge-of-failure feeling was the most prominent . It dwarfed all other feelings , crowding them out and pushing them to the edge of his consciousness , where they squatted like old packages in the corner of a room . Perhaps there were good things in those packages , useful things , but James had n't the time to unwrap them . <p> James heard the soft thud of the door in the other part of the apartment as Mindy came in . Or perhaps he only sensed her presence . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vibrations she set off in the air . They were n't particularly soothing vibrations , but they were familiar . <p> Mindy appeared before him , paused , then sat down in his old leather club chair , purchased at the fire sale in the Plaza when the venerable hotel was sold for condos for even more rich people . " James , " she said . <p> " Yes , " James said , barely looking up from his computer . <p> " Mrs. Houghton 's dead . " <p> James stared at her blankly . <p> " Did you know that ? " Mindy asked . <p> " It was all over the Internet this morning . " <p> " Why did n't you tell me ? " <p> " I thought you knew . " <p> " I 'm the head of the board , and you did n't tell me , " Mindy said . " I just ran into Billy Litchfield . He told me . It was embarrassing . " <p> " Do n't you have better things to worry about ? " James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I 've got to worry about that apartment . And who 's going to move into it . And what kind of people they 're going to be . Why do n't we live in that apartment ? " <p> " Because it 's worth about twenty million dollars , and we do n't happen to have twenty million dollars lying around ? " James said . <p> " And whose fault is that ? " Mindy said . <p> " Mindy , please , " James said . He scratched his head . " We 've discussed this a million times . There is nothing wrong with our apartment . " <p> * * * <p> On the thirteenth floor , the floor below the three grand floors that had been Mrs. Houghton 's apartment , Enid Merle stood on her terrace , thinking about Louise . The top of the building was tiered like a wedding cake , so the upper terraces were visible to those below . How shocking that only three days ago , she 'd been standing in this very spot , conversing with Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise had never allowed the sun to touch her skin , and she 'd rarely moved her face , believing that facial expressions caused wrinkles . She 'd had at least two face-lifts , but nevertheless , even on the day of the storm , Enid remembered noting that Louise 's skin had been astoundingly smooth . Enid was a different story . Even as a little girl , she 'd hated all that female fussiness and overbearing attention to one 's appearance . Nevertheless , due to the fact that she was a public persona , Enid had eventually succumbed to a face-lift by the famous Dr. Baker , whose society patients were known as " Baker 's Girls . " At eighty-two , Enid had the face of a sixty-five-year-old , although the rest of her was not only creased but as pleasantly speckled as a chicken . <p> For those who knew the history of the building and its occupants , Enid Merle was not only its second oldest resident-after Mrs. Houghton-but in the sixties and seventies , one of its most notorious . Enid , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University ( making her one of the college 's first women to earn one ) , had taken a job as a secretary at the New York Star in 1948 , and given her fascination with the antics of humanity , and possessing a sympathetic ear , had worked her way into the gossip department , eventually securing her own column . Having spent the early part of her life on a cotton farm in Texas , Enid always felt slightly the outsider and approached her work with the good Southern values of kindness and sympathy . Enid was known as the " nice " gossip columnist , and it had served her well : When actors and politicians were ready to tell their side of a story , they called Enid . In the early eighties , the column had been syndicated , and Enid had become a wealthy woman . She 'd been trying to retire for ten years , but her name , argued her employers , was too valuable , and so Enid worked with a staff that gathered information and wrote the column , although under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise Houghton 's death was one such circumstance . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
