<p> If Evelyn and Nathan Hoffman had not exchanged more than 2,000 love letters while he was overseas during World War II , they never would have married . <p> And if they had n't saved the letters , their grandchildren never would have known about her love poems to him  --  and his instructions to her in 1946 : " Pucker up , honey . I 'm coming home . " <p> The two had five dates before he shipped out in 1944 . They wrote " about our likes and dislikes , the people we liked to associate with , do you like this music , that literature , " says Evelyn , 76 , of Waco , Texas . " That is why some couples break up : They do n't really know what the other person wants . Writing letters is a wonderful way to court . " <p> Maybe so . But in this era in which e-mail prevails , does anybody write love letters anymore ? After all , today you can get a cyberfriend to write one for you . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what type of love letter you 'd like , from steamy to poetic . The sentiments instantly go by e-mail to your love . <p> Google , an Internet search engine , offers 350,000 Web pages about love letters . Go to the search engine Lycos ( loveletters.lycos.com ) and publish your own . Or read the letters posted there and rate them , from five points ( " incredibly romantic " ) down to one ( " return to Romance 101 " ) . And Signature Software can come up with a font of your handwriting so you can e-mail tender musings in your own electronic hand , via signaturesoftware.com . <p> Love letters sent on the Internet have their defenders . Nancy Pope is a curator at the National Postal Museum who values the written word . But she says e-mail messages are no less legitimate . " We are back to learning how to write . It may be another language you use on the Net , not necessarily approved English , but the connection between two people is still important . " <p> Many others , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyberspace , saying such communications have all the romance of toxic waste . And they worry the traditional letter on quality paper is fading from the cultural map . <p> " The art of the love letter is going the way of the condor , " says University of New Orleans historian Douglas Brinkley . " It is becoming an endangered species . . . . Today , people express themselves with e-mail . " <p> It is a paltry substitute , Brinkley says . " The point of a love letter is to have a permanent remembrance . You notice the handwriting , the date , even the stationery . E-mail is not the same . " It often is error-ridden and slapdash , in keeping with today 's penchant for speed , he says . And he wonders , " Will somebody someday open a family chest and pull out a disk or printout ? " <p> Etiquette maven Judith Martin ( Miss Manners ) says , " It is hard to kiss an e-mail , is n't it ? It is hard to tie up an e-mail with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She also cautions that passionate e-mail can be sent to the wrong person or be forwarded to others by a recipient who is not smitten . <p> Granted , a handwritten love letter can be " intimidating " for a swain to pen , says Andrew Carroll , who has collected 20,000 letters , including romantic correspondence , for his Legacy Project . His non-profit enterprise encourages Americans to save the letters written home by those in combat . <p> The impact of written communication is just so much greater than that of e-mail , he says . When you put pen to paper , " the implicit message is that you are worth the time . And in this day and age , that is the most important message you can send . " <p> Carroll likes e-mail for business . But for something like a love letter , " e-mail is like Muzak , and the letter is like jazz . The letter comes from the soul . E-mail is artificial , synthetic , with nothing of the tangible quality of a letter . " <p> Preserved love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new impressions of family members , Carroll says . As he gathered material for a book , the best-selling Letters of a Nation : A Collection of Extraordinary American Letters , Carroll was struck by the poignant cover letters that adult children wrote about the treasures they had discovered . <p> They would write , Carroll says , " I never saw my Dad cry , or express any emotion throughout his life . When I read his letters , and saw the intensity and passion and expressiveness , it blew my mind . This is just not the Dad I remember . " In everyday life , Carroll says , " we hide our best selves . But it is revealed in our letters . " <p> Bill Donahue was stunned to discover new qualities in his grandfather when Donahue inherited about 40 letters written by his granddad to a girlfriend from 1915 through 1919 . Donahue wrote about them for The Washington Post , quoting his granddad : " Betty , you are the first girl that I 've ever cared for . Do you know how it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Portland , Ore. , says he barely knew his relative . " My grandfather died when I was only 6 . He was this old guy we visited in the rest home . I sort of had a notion of him as austere . The letters let me see a part of him that I was never aware of , him as a young guy " who delivered his messages of love " in a really enchanting way . " <p> Donahue says he has not written many letters in five years : He uses e-mail . But " e-mail is about as magical as a light switch . " <p> You do n't have to be apart to send a love letter , says Steve Leveen , 45 , of Delray Beach , Fla . He recently wrote one to his wife to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their first date . They met on the New York subway and went first to the Statue of Liberty . In his note , he enclosed the stubs left from that tour 20 years ago . " You ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses it often . His company , Levenger , offers a catalog specializing in writing accessories . <p> Carroll has hundreds of love letters . His favorite appears in his book , a missive from Charles Drew to his fianc&eacute;e , Lenore Robbins , in 1940 : " For years I have done little but work , plan and dream of making myself a good doctor , an able surgeon and in my wildest moments perhaps also playing some part in establishing a real school of thought among Negro physicians . <p> " Then I met you and for the first time mistress medicine met her match and went down almost without a fight . " ( Drew went on to become one of the country 's most respected doctors and researchers , revolutionizing the preservation of blood for emergency use , Carroll writes . ) <p> Letters do n't have to be so eloquent to hit the mark , Carroll says . He remembers one he wrote in high school . " I got her name wrong ; I spelled it phonetically . I really messed up . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impressed . " <p> Nathan Hoffman says that while Evelyn 's letters " became rather passionate , " he was more conservative . " I am not as expressive as she is . " But his love was quite obvious from his letters , he says . " She was waiting in Waco for me . She got the message loud and clear . " <p> That message came through in his letter of Dec. 30 , 1944 : <p> " Honey , knowing you has meant a great deal to me because the love you have for me is totally different from that of those at home for me and it is love like yours that I want . But on the other hand , it is love like ours that I am not entitled to unless I can give you something in return . " <p> He did . They married Feb. 24 , 1946 , a month after Nathan arrived home .
