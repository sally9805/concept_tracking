Section : TRAINING A bigger chest . A longer tee shot . Better sex . Get those results  --  and more with these simple moves <p> NO MAN WANTS TO BE CALLED A STIFF . In fact , we can think of only one context in which the word " stiff " is a compliment . And if you take away that one context , " inflexible " and " rigid " are just as undesirable . These are bad words , " honey , it 's not working out " words , " make damn sure the alimony checks do n't bounce " words . <p> A stiff body is n't grounds for divorce  --  not even in Vermont  --  but in a way it 's a trial separation from your well-being . Tight hamstrings can lead to runner 's knee , a painful condition that could make you less active . Tight pectorals limit your strength and put your shoulders at risk of injury . And tight pelvic muscles can minimize the motion in the ocean  --  a place where the word " deeper " does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosophy . <p> The moves that follow are a combination of muscle-relaxation exercises that solve a problem instantly and stretches you can use to increase your flexibility in critical areas over time . No matter how you mix and match them , you 'll lose the creaks in your joints and pick up some bounce in your step . And you may even pump new energy into your love life . Make your knees feel young again <p> Forget the fact that you run a 2-minute 40 . Your gimpy , Joe Namath-like knees are keeping you from achieving the athletic glory you deserve . And if you 're like most men with aching hinges , tight muscles are a big reason for your pain . " If you 're inflexible , your joints do n't have a full range of motion , which means you 're forcing your body to do things that it is physically incapable of , " says Vinny Comiskey , head athletic trainer with the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista , California . The following stretch offers a double benefit : It increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the other leg . MODIFIED-LUNGE STRETCH <p> Find a padded surface and kneel on your right knee with your left leg extended straight out in front of you , toes up and heel on the floor . Keeping your right hand on the floor for balance , lean forward , shifting weight to your left foot , and grab the toes of that foot with your left hand ( see photo above ) . Pull the toes toward you and feel the stretch in the back of your left leg . You should also feel a mild stretch in the front of your right thigh . Hold for 30 seconds ( or as long as you can stand it ) , then relax . Alternate legs and repeat . Do three to five with each leg . Add an inch to yew chest <p> Just guessing here , but you probably take some pride in the size and strength of your pectoral muscles . Or would , if your months and years of bench-pressing had actually produced some size and strength . In fact , all that <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes those muscles less impressive . " If you do a lot of bench-press work , your chest muscles may get short and tight , " says Mike Bracko , Ed.D. , a sports physiologist and spokesman for the American College of Sports Medicine . That means the muscles you 're trying to build are pulling your shoulders in and rotating your arms forward , so your chest muscles may end up looking smaller . And , because they 're pulling your shoulders out of their natural alignment , they 're setting you up for a host of injuries . To restore your pectoral flexibility and reduce your risk of injury ( and start turning heads with your impressive chest ) , Bracko recommends this stretch . Do it after you warm up but before you do chest exercises . I CROSS STRETCH <p> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent . Lift your arms so they form a " T " with your torso , and turn your palms down . Slowly rotate your thumbs backward and stick out your chest as you pull your arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulder blades together to extend your range of motion . Now , instead of holding one long stretch , do five pulsing stretches . That is , pull your arms back an extra inch or two , and then allow them to spring forward an inch or two ; repeat . Do two or three sets of five pulses , then a set of 10 pushups . Now you 're ready to approach the bench . De-stress after a day at the office <p> Although tossing back a few cold ones is a time-honored stress-reduction method , it does n't do anything for your lower-back muscles , which get short and tight from a full day of sitting , says Richard Cotton , chief exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise . Cotton recommends this move as soon as you get home from work or reach your destination after a long drive or plane flight . SPINAL-ROTATION STRETCH <p> Lie flat on your back with your arms out to your sides , forming a " T " with your body , and turn your palms toward the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent and resting against each other . Now slowly roll your lower body to the left as one unit , keeping your knees , lower legs , and thighs together and your arms flat on the floor ( see photo above , right ) . Turn your head to the right . Breathe normally while you hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds . You should feel a gentle release in the muscles of your lower back . Repeat , turning your lower body to the right and your head to the left . Complete three repetitions on each side . If this hurts , stop immediately . Make her forget her last boyfriend <p> You do n't have to be Gumby in bed  --  unless she 's really into asymmetrical green men . But you probably have a problem Gumby never has to worry about : tight hip flexors and abductors . These tiny strips of muscle on the front and inside of your pelvis can limit your range of motion , a serious problem in the coital arena . " With more flexibility , you 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fair warning : Do n't try this one in the gym . Like sex , it 's a private affair . " PELVIC-THRUST STRETCH <p> Get down on your hands and knees . Spread your knees apart and slowly sit back . Keep your hands on the floor just in front of your knees for balance . Maintaining a pain-free range of motion , gently are your hips up and down . Do three sets of 10 to 20 repetitions . Extra points if you can say , " Yeah , baby ! " on each repetition . Hit your tee shot 10 yards farther <p> Despite the fact that it 's played with a putter and balls , golf is about as far from sex as an activity can get . Curiously , though , both sports depend on rotational flexibility . In sex , it 's for thrusting . In golf , it 's for power . Separating hip and trunk rotation allows your powerful lower-body muscles to initiate the action , says Nell Chasan , a physical therapist and author of Total Conditioning for Golfers . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor or style . Your score will suffer , whether you 're in bed or on the fairway . HIP- AND TRUNK-ROTATION STRETCH <p> Stand with your back to a wall , your heels about 10 inches away from it . Set your feet shoulder-width apart and bend your knees slightly . Without moving your feet , turn to your right and place both hands on the wall , shoulder-width apart , at shoulder height . Now lean your right hip toward the wall . Go easy , Tiger  --  you want to feel some tension , but the stretch should n't cause pain . Hold for a few seconds , then rotate to your left and repeat . Try five to 10 repetitions on each side once a day . Chasan says to aim for small , incremental improvements , rather than trying to make a big increase right away . Look thinner in 90 seconds <p> Despite what you may have heard , the Hunchback of Notre Dame was never a big ladies ' man . So stand up straight . It 'll make you appear taller , thinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself out ? The following stretch , recommended by Comiskey . It works most of the muscles of your trunk , from the hip flexors and rectus abdominis of your midsection to the scalenes  --  the ropy muscles of your neck . " When you 're stressed , all of these muscles get tight , and that makes you hunch forward , " says Comiskey . Do this stretch when you take a break from your desk or after a long day at work . ACTIVE POSTURE STRETCH <p> Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent . Place a fist on each of your temples and bring your arms in front so your triceps are parallel to the floor and your elbows point forward . Pull your chin to your chest and exhale as you go into a comfortable crouch , bending until your elbows hang down between your knees . <p> From this position , slowly stand up straight and unfold your body as you inhale . Straighten your legs and back and swing your elbows outward so they point out to your sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise your chin toward the ceiling . Hold this final position for 5 seconds . Do five repetitions . Lose Your Edge , Get a Raise <p> Sometimes , the best stretch you can do is n't a stretch at all . Flexing and relaxing muscles not only can alleviate aches and pains , but also can take the nervous edge off life 's toughest moments . AVOID AIR RAGE : <p> If you 've been sitting too long in the same position  --  during a cross-country flight . say , or when watching your son 's T-ball team eke out a 25-24 nail-biter  --  you can relieve the stress that builds up in your spinal disks by standing and bending backward , with your hands pressed against the small of your back . " The real value of back-bending is that it relieves the spine , which does n't like prolonged static positions , " says Nell Chasan , a physical therapist in Seattle . So even though you 're flexing your lower-back muscles when you do this , you 're relieving built-up pressure . ACE THAT PRESENTATION <p> Dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally creates tightness in the upper back  --  near the neck  --  and in the facial muscles . It also constricts your diaphragm , so you have trouble breathing deeply . So when a boss , or a tough client , sees someone sitting with stiff shoulders and a tense little slash of a smile on his face , struggling to get a deep breath , he knows he has the upper hand . <p> Chasan recommends these moves : Before the meeting , shrug your shoulders and relax them several times . Scrunch your face  --  imagine you 've just seen Linda Tripp naked  --  and relax it . Finally , yawn , which relaxes your diaphragm . Now you can appear relaxed , smile easily , and breathe deeply . Which should put some fear into your boss , for a change . <p> By Mark Anders <p>
