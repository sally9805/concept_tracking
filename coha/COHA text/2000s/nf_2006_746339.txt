Wilbur Zelinsky 's classic 1977 account of the Pennsylvania town as a cultural place type  --  the urban component of the nationally influential Pennsylvanian culture region  --  acknowledged that it was not exported intact across the successive western frontiers of the United States . But , aside from Edward Price 's specialized study of courthouse squares , we know little that is systematic about how town-planning ideas diffused across the continent . This investigation offers evidence from the Willamette Valley in Oregon of the eventual variety and geographical distribution of town-platting conventions that developed in this Pacific Coast " destination " setting and the possible provenance in the Ohio Valley of certain early Oregonian town-plan features . The evidence raises questions about the resilience of town-planning conventions in light of the distance carried , cultural time lags , and changing ideas about best practice and local suitability . <p> Keywords : cultural diffusion ; Oregon ; place identity ; town planning ; urban morphology ; Willamette Valley <p> This study is a delayed response to Wilbur Zelinsky 's celebrated article on the Pennsylvania town , a groundbreaking attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong regional urban type that has yet to be replicated with similar specificity for any other cultural region of comparable size in the United States . According to the model , the essence of the Pennsylvania town lies in its " dense aggregation of spatially mixed functions in regionally distinctive structures , closely spaced and often built of brick , set along a generally rectilinear lattice of arboreal streets and well-kept alleys frequently focused on a diamond-shaped central square " ( 1977,138 ) . Geographers and other scholars have long understood U.S. cities and towns to be the loci of progressive economic and social development and modernity within the nation . Consequently , the analytical emphasis has been much more on seeing them as components of a growing functional system  --  displaying a unitary , hierarchical , and homogeneous character  --  than as an array of regionally distinct urban place types . Yet , for all the obvious functional similarities between cities large and small across the land , regional urban traditions have long existed and continue to play a role in national and local life , whether in such aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or environmental accommodations . Zelinsky 's portrait of the Pennsylvania town is an inspiring attempt to measure and characterize an observable regional urban type , but the need for similarly rigorous typifications in other American cultural contexts remains poorly met . This study aims to define some equally essential characteristics of a regional complex of towns in the Pacific Northwest as a contribution to enlarging the basis for comparison . Though distant , the Pacific Northwest is intimately related to the rich array of cultural forces that shaped towns and cities in the eastern United States , as so ably examined in Pennsylvania . <p> Zelinsky 's synopsis relied heavily on urban morphology as a reflexive and accessible key to the cultural personality of communities , and it showed how systematic townscape features can define and delimit regional urban complexes distinct from those found elsewhere . He argued persuasively that the Pennsylvania town was  --  and still is  --  qualitatively and measurably different from its colonial-origin counterparts in New England , the Hudson Valley , Virginia , and points south . But if the Pennsylvania town developed so characteristic an identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban replication on the successive frontiers of the American West ? James Lemon ( 1972 ) argued long ago that the Pennsylvanian worldview  --  economically liberal , tolerant , commercial , and energetic  --  helped develop the national character as much as , if not more than , that of the Yankee-Yorkers or of southern culture , and at least rural features of the Pennsylvania culture region without question spread to key parts of the Midwest ( Rose 1988 ; Ensminger 1992 , 147-180 ) . The latitudinal migration streams that carried eastern seaboard settlement traditions westward have been well documented ( Hudson 1984 , 1988 ; Meyer 2000 ) , and one might expect the Pennsylvania town to have found physical footing in the West in ways similar to that of the New England town , featuring the meeting house or church facing a generous central common ( Larson 1975 ; Wood 1997 ) . But Zelinsky concluded that the Pennsylvania town was an artifact of its time and place and that other forces rose up to redefine towns to the west with different characteristics , most notably a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical dimensions. ( n1 ) <p> It is often argued that urban places by their nature have always been more cosmopolitan than their rural hinterlands , well connected as they are by interregional trade and communication with other centers , where innovations , if not necessarily originating in towns , are quickly adopted and diffused through the network . In doing so they have tended to dissolve regional distinctiveness in the look and feel of towns in the face of those new and competing ideas . Such a tendency away from replicating the material traits of older urban regions could be particularly strong in frontier settings , where the tabula rasa afforded by new development opportunities might emphasize new practices and new choices related especially to conditions encountered in the new environment . <p> Yet careful observation suggests that regional urban distinctiveness does not end with the Pennsylvania town or other eastern seaboard urban traditions . Cultural and historical geographers have mapped the process of cultural dilution and selective reformulation taking place as inland secondary culture areas developed in the course of continental settlement . With time these processes could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become locally established in more westerly regions . The Upper South , the Ohio Valley , and the Great Lakes basin have been shown to act as key staging areas for more culturally fluid onward migration and , along with it , new forms of environmental adjustment and implementation of advances in technology ( Mitchell 1978 ; Hudson 1985 ; Jordan and Kaups 1989 ; Conzen 1994 , 373 ) . A small but instructive example of this development of new urban forms is Edward Price 's discovery relating to that focal element of many Pennsylvania towns : the central courthouse square . He found that , just as the urbanistically impressive but tricky , block-modifying " Philadelphia/ Lancaster square " was petering out as a choice in laying out new towns in the Midwest in the first half of the nineteenth century , the simpler , grid-conformal " Shelbyville square " engendered in Tennessee gained popularity and eventually spread more widely to various western states ( Price 1968 ) . ( n2 ) The presence and strength or otherwise of such choices could significantly influence the developing composite urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas ( Veselka 2000 ) , and for Iowa and Minnesota ( Schmiedeler 1998 , 200l ) . Thus , we might look to these midwestern heartland regions as the incubators of urban practices and forms that would prove more viable in settling the remainder of the continent . If the Pennsylvania town was not in general a strong model for western urbanization , what urban ideas and designs for the physical structure of towns were carried westward by migrants from the nation 's more developed core , how were they implemented , and what combinations of different forms resulted ? <p> As a test of these ideas , this study looks at urban morphogenesis in Oregon 's Willamette Valley from its frontier phase through the early twentieth century and examines the choices made in locating towns in the landscape and shaping their original urban plats . Rather than seeking to typify the total character of the region 's towns , the study asks with what designs the towns in the area were first laid out and whether the patterns found might lend some distinctiveness to regional urban character . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargoes of town-building ideas " ( 2005 ) carried westward on the tides of American settlement , and it asks whether these design ideas could coexist separately , or necessarily had to fuse with , or inevitably succumb to , concurrent or later-arriving competitors . It also considers the extent to which certain plan elements become favored and survive in some localities long after their popularity in the wider world has passed . <p> Why should town plats merit study in this fashion ? They embody the urban community 's most basic need for a minimally orderly spatial framework within which work , residence , and circulation can function , secured through a legally sanctioned property-holding system tied to this spatial framework . In an American freehold land-market context in which most towns , by the nineteenth century , were founded as speculative ventures , the location and plan features of a town  --  such as lot size , orientation , public reserves , and access  --  could often spell the difference between initial success and failure . Plat designs could enhance or inhibit the marketability of lots and thus influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the natural inertia inherent in the long-term multiplicity and fragmented pattern of ownership , can make the persisting elements of the plan in city centers  --  such as fixed street widths , small block size , and awkward intersection geometry  --  formidable obstacles to needed physical changes ( Siksna 1997,1998 ) . The initial layout of towns can be a boon to their evolution  --  or a costly set of shortsighted and enduring blunders . THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY AS A TABULA RASA FOR NEW TOWNS <p> Western Oregon offers an unrivaled western laboratory in which to observe the experimentation with , and competition among , different de novo urban designs in creating a viable urban network well before standardization set in with the railroads from the 1870s on . The Willamette Valley 's earliest Euro-American settlement predates California 's Gold Rush in the late 1840s and early 1850s and well predates the arrival of the railroad , which came in 1870 ( Dicken and Dicken 1979 , 64-83 ) . Beginning in the early 1840s the Oregon Trail bequeathed the area an agricultural and urban history much more akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else west of the Rocky Mountain Front . But the cultural picture is more complex than re-creating a partial midwestern agrarian economy would suggest , for the U.S. South was a major contributor to Oregon 's early settler profile . In terms of the total population born outside Oregon in 1850 , the leading source states were Missouri , Illinois , Ohio , Kentucky , and Indiana . If one counts family and kinship ties among migrants to Oregon , the top states represented were Ohio , Kentucky , New York , Virginia , and Tennessee . Among recipients of land under the Oregon Donation Land Claims ( DLC ) system , which would include many early town founders , the states best represented were Missouri , Illinois , Kentucky , Ohio , and Indiana ( Bowen 1978 , 25 , 40-41 ) . As an assembly ground for several southern migration streams , Missouri was a key mixing area , and the town of Independence was the gateway to the Oregon Trail . So the Willamette Valley was no mere distant proxy for midwestern conditions . As the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the region served to mix several quite distinct cultural streams and town-founding traditions more thoroughly than did any comparably compact part of the Midwest or the Great Plains ( Meinig 1999 , 69-89 ) . <p> We are used to thinking of urban planning in the American West as displaying , outside the Hispanic rim and the Mormon realm , a repetitive and rather uninteresting pattern of seemingly simple grid layouts owing their forms largely to the railroad ( American Architect and Building News 1877 ; Reps 1979 ; Hudson 1982 ) . ( n3 ) But this reflects a failure to study western town plans systematically for evidence of the varied processes of selective transfer , adoption , and modification of planning ideas in this vast domain . What can the town-founding history of the Willamette Valley in Oregon contribute to understanding the establishment of urban traditions in frontier settings , and with what diversity and consequences did town-design concepts from different source regions in the East cross the continent ? This is an inquiry into the formative nature of a western urban character distinctly looser than its eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's celebrated type , will here be called the " non-Pennsylvania town . " Though based on evidence from Oregon , the term can serve also for a large number of western towns far to the east and south of it. ( n4 ) <p> The study concerns the original plats of all initial , independent townsites in the Willamette Valley laid out between 1842 and 1930 , almost 200 of them. ( n5 ) They range in size from hundreds of acres down to 3 or 4 acres , but size is not the foremost consideration , reflecting only the ambition of a particular landowner in a particular instance . One of the largest plats in the region was the Milwaukie plat facing the Willamette River in Clackamas County , covering about 550 acres and containing 351 blocks measuring 250 by 260 feet , but not much of this expanse survived over the long haul . In contrast , Portland 's original townsite comprised a mere sixteen blocks of similar dimensions , but it proved to be the nucleus of a vast city cadastre . More significant than overall size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this better reflects planning ideas suitable for an urban environment. ( n6 ) <p> Central to understanding western pioneer town planning is its democratic basis and close to total lack of regulation . Any landowner could plat a town at any time , in any location , of any size , with any design ; could register that plat with the authorities ; and could promptly start selling off town lots . Laws generally required only that lots be given legal property descriptions ; that is , be numbered within numbered blocks or follow a single lot-numbering sequence throughout the plat and be set within a pattern of streets  --  and perhaps alleys  --  dedicated to permanent public ownership and use , along with any open space designated explicitly for hoped-for institutional use , such as waterfront landings , courthouses , academies , or parks . Authorities cared not a whit about plat geometry or the dimensions of essential features . Proprietors were free to lay out principal streets , for example , of 60 or 80 or 100 feet in width according to personal whim and blocks and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free to institute any plan that their imagination , common sense , or idiosyncratic urge might conjure up . As a result , many townsites were platted . " No one believed that so many cities as had then been platted by about 1849 were needed for a population of a few thousand , " wrote Charles Carey in his history of early Oregon , " but each group of town builders had faith and courage , and even confidence that its particular venture would outstrip all the rest " ( 1935 , 2 : 649 ) . <p> Town platters varied from individuals to corporations , from illiterate farmers to slick speculators , and ran the gamut from mathematical ignoramuses to sophisticated engineers . Surveyors , often the county surveyor  --  charged with actually laying out the streets and lots on the ground and marking the corners with stakes  --  probably played the key role in determining the specific design of individual plats because of their training and experience , but because such work was for hire it is impossible to gauge how much influence landowners wielded in insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence and circulation within the town efficient and attractive or cumbersome and boring . Too often the specific antecedence of chosen design elements remains indeterminable , for in a region like the Willamette Valley exceedingly few records describe any of the reasons behind particular elements in town plans . However , for all the historical obscurity of the detailed decisions that went into plat design , the sharply etched and fascinating evidence on the ground of what actually was chosen stares up at us uncompromisingly from the pages of the county recorders ' plat and deed books ( Figure 1 ) . ASSEMBLING THE EVIDENCE <p> For this investigation , the officially recorded plats of all townsites established in the nine-county region that encompasses the Willamette Valley before 1930 were examined . Plans were obtained from county archives for all townsites , ( n7 ) excluding only about a dozen among the very earliest ones for which no official plats have survived and which , in most cases , failed to develop into permanent communities . A number of later exurban subdivisions placed on the immediate margins of Portland in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  have also been ruled out . All townsite plats were carefully evaluated to establish exact location , actual date of implementation , and possible classification in a design typology . The plats included in the research embrace both successful townsites that anchor urban places to this day and those that qualify historically as " paper towns " townsites that failed to develop at all or , like shooting stars , whose fortunes swiftly expired . Some of the latter left no enduring marks on the landscape . Among these the ones founded early , during the DLC period before court recording became routinely effective , proved quite difficult to locate accurately on the ground. ( n8 ) <p> Towns are considered to have originated when their proprietors caused their plats to be laid out physically on the ground , at which point lot sales could , and usually did , commence . This is critical in understanding the process of U.S. town making , because common assumptions about when a town began have often varied widely and led to confusion . In Oregon a specific chain of events led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some cases survey plats failed to make it into the official record in a timely manner , jeopardizing legal title to property . Estimates of a town 's origin can stem from dates given for any of the events shown in Table I as numbers 3-8 , depending on available evidence and historical interpretation . Event 3  --  townsite surveyed and staked out  --  is used in this study . Delayed townsite surveys and resurveys ( events 6 and 7 ) could occur belatedly when early county government was barely functioning , or when the proprietor procrastinated , or both . Much effort was expended in establishing precise dates of platting , especially for towns begun during the Provisional and Territorial Periods ( 1843-1859 ; in 1859 Oregon became the thirty-third state in the union ) , when requirements for registering townsite plats were haphazard and quite often postponed or disregarded . Such cases are particularly troublesome because resurveys for retrospective official records bear dates that some researchers have mistaken for those of their original establishment . <p> Some early Oregonian townsites are older by up to a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plat records at face value , realize . Albany , for example , was platted in 1848 , but the plat was not registered until 1860 , and Harrisburg 's 1853 plat was not legally recorded until 1866 . CYCLES WITHIN A CYCLE OF TOWN FOUNDING <p> Town founding in the Willamette Valley responded to two cyclical periodicities over the span of nearly a century ( Figure 2 ) . The large cycle covering the whole period under study represents the sum total of human effort made  --  beneficial but also overreaching  --  to fill the region with townsites sufficient for its eventual needs . It describes a historical bell curve that began with the surveying of Oregon City in 1842 , peaked in 1889 , when fourteen townsites were added to the region in a single year , and ended around 1930 when the process had run its course and all plausible sites , as well as a good many not so plausible ones , had been platted . Within this great wave shorter cycles reflected the immediacy of capital fluctuations resulting from business depressions , wars , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1842-1860 , created the basic skeleton of the region 's urban system , during which forty-six townsites were established , the first eighteen of which were river towns. ( n9 ) A second small wave during the 1860s added eight sites , barely influenced by the distant Civil War . The advent of railroads produced a spike in town founding during the trunk-line developments of the 1870s and branch construction during the 1880s . A final cycle during the first fifteen years of the twentieth century responded to the diffusion of electric railways that offered a slower but less expensive transportation alternative to steam . Platting beyond this time frame increasingly involved the metropolitan suburbanization of Portland , creating isolated plats that had little to do with their traditionally rural surroundings and a great deal to do with commuting . <p> The geography of these cycles is instructive and largely logical ( Figure 3 ) . The oldest townsites hugged the riverbanks , for steamboat travel was the one dependable avenue of movement before regional roads were built . Champoeg ( 1844 ) , Portland ( 1845 ) , Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1851 ) , and Harrisburg ( 1853 ) joined Oregon City as important early dots on the map . The second wave of the prerailroad era catered modestly to localities away from the navigable rivers . North Brownsville ( 1856 ) and Sheridan ( 1866 ) exemplify this trend . With the arrival of the steam railroad in 1870 , a new spatial strategy suddenly emerged : In addition to connecting the larger preexisting towns with their assured markets , the new lines passed through emerging agricultural areas that were more removed from the waterways but whose farmers were eager for export links . This spurred many townsite creations right along the tracks where none had existed before . Canby , Gervais , Halsey , and Junction City ( which never did receive its expected railroad junction ) , all platted between 1870 and 1872 , symbolize this widespread development . After the trunk lines had been built and " infill " towns placed along them , branch lines encouraged townsite multiplication well into the early 1890s , spreading towns such as McLeay and Coburg far across the maturing agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of town founding took place in the last remaining underserved districts in which to establish service centers , as Donald and Wilsonville on interurban routes and Summitville and Marcola up logging-rich side valleys attest . Many of the interurban townsites did not develop significantly until their surrounding countryside had been transformed into automobile-commuter suburbs after 1950 . <p> This , then , was the unfolding picture : an urbanizing region blessed with agricultural and forest resources that from the time of the California Gold Rush helped feed the Pacific Coast and beyond ; a major navigable river that inaugurated its much-strengthened transportation spine from an early date ; and a diverse base of small processing industries utilizing abundant local waterpower ( Holtgrieve 1973 ; Dicken and Dicken 1979 ) . M1 this fed a sustained town-founding frenzy that filled a space not much smaller than the Pennsylvania Culture Region in about one-third the time ( Smith 1967 ) , a space that was searching like any region , consciously or not , for an urban identity . What can be said about the town forms that were so readily thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? TOWN  --  PLAN CHARACTER : TOWARD A TYPOLOGY <p> The most obvious characteristic of Willamette Valley original town plans is their considerable variety in detail , embracing many permutations of size , orientation to site and external features , internal street structure , block and lot dimensions , alley space , and public reserves . It is a characteristic potentially to be found in almost any region , especially in the United States , where every landholder is a free agent able to decide when , where , and how to attempt to found a town . This variety resulted from the proliferation of easy platting models requiring minimal knowledge of mathematics and surveying drawn from experience in the East or the Midwest , the paucity of official rules , and the competitive , short-term efficiency-rewarding frontier setting in which sophisticated urban design was a concept best left for later generations. ( n10 ) From this standpoint , the overall appearance of western Oregon towns was two-sided : a general impression of seemingly repetitive grid layouts with regimented building arrangement in which impressive vistas happened only by accident ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abilities and idiosyncrasies of ordinary folk and their surveyors in adjusting stock planning ideas to local terrain , or not . <p> Yet there were limits to the variety . No town in the Willamette Valley received a full Philadelphia- or Lancaster-type central square , suggesting that this venerable Pennsylvania urban ornament had finally lost its power crossing the Missouri River . What did make it to the West were several Shelbyville central squares , mostly placed in plats of towns wing for county-seat status . Early county seats , including Salem ( 1846 ) , Lafayette ( 1847 ) , and Albany ( 1848 ) , being river towns , made do with simple block squares  --  that is , squares not disturbing the standard lot orientation of the larger plat  --  placed away from the waterfront to avoid interfering with its business axis ( see Figure 1 ) . But beginning with Dayton ( 1850 ) , would-be Yamhill County seat , five towns received Shelbyville squares . The practice did not extend to all of the remaining county seats in the valley , and the little mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last Willamette community to be provided with any official noncommercial public space . Thereafter , land was set aside only for colleges ( Forest Grove and Philomath ) or , after the turn of the twentieth century , for parks designed in new neoromantic , nongrid shapes ( Cove Orchard , Timber , and Fayetteville ) . Two very old hamlets started by a French Canadian Catholic Mission , St. Paul ( 1838 ) and St. Louis ( 1846 ) , also had four-block squares reserved within their plats , assigned  --  as might be expected to parish churches and a convent . There were town-design elements that reflected special conventions brought with the settlers , but they formed a simplified roster by any comparative measure . And yet on the ground , within the broad grid framework , no two towns were exactly alike . How can this be brought into systematic focus ? <p> For analytical purposes the next step was to discern whether the region 's townsite designs followed a typological pattern . This necessitated ignoring the huge diversity of small , embedded morphological details and examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements emerges from the complex picture ( Figure 4 ) . The single most distinguishing element of town plans is their orientation in space to some physical or cultural control that " fixes " spatial orientation  --  a five-class , top-level element , which will here be called the " fixation feature . " In the Willamette Valley , elements that qualify are : rivers important for their navigability or waterpower ; the U.S. survey grid ; boundaries of the precursor DLCS , as well as highways ; and railroads producing layouts either parallel or orthogonal to railroad tracks . Only one of these is natural , and topography is not separately recognized , other than in the course of rivers , but the cultural fixation features also reflect accommodations to environment , such as alignments that avoid crossing marshes or tunneling through hills . <p> The second level comprises modal city " block form " and associated street margins , and five varieties emerge . The most interesting distinction , aside from the obvious geometric differences between rectilinear and irregular forms , is that between square and rectangular blocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , reaching back to antiquity , and it had a proud innings in Oregon . But the newer rectangular block had two major advantages over the square block : reducing the overall proportion of the city area dedicated to public streets and therefore adding to land for private sale ; and reducing the number of street intersections in which traffic could become clogged , especially once the automobile appeared . Lot patterns within blocks have not been distinguished because consistent arrangements with potential geographical variability were not immediately apparent . <p> The third level recognizes " types of alleys " and their presence or absence in the plan . At first glance seemingly trivial , alleys in fact serve as highly sensitive markers of town design over time and space ( Conzen 2004a ) . Alleys provide rear access to properties for services and utilities in dense environments and are a gift to the merchant bourgeoisie both downtown and in their residential neighborhoods . Their absence denotes , depending on lot width , either disregard for amenities or their privatization . Alleys can be either a sign of civic awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symbol of growing social disfunction . The earliest alley type in Oregon was the cross alley , and its history and fate are full of interest . <p> Space prohibits illustrating each of these types with individual town plans , but the illustration of Lafayette , founded in 1847 , suggests how the elements come together ( see Figure 1 ) . The plan is fixated on the Yamhill River , placing the public landing ( the " Common " ) at a spot on the outside of a meander for deeper water to bring the watercraft closer to the dock . The town slopes gently uphill away from the river , and the courthouse square and the public square enjoy views and breezes befitting their community status . The blocks have no alleys , indicating how early the newer block form came into favor in Oregon . Overall , the plat is representative of Oregonian town plans  --  easily surveyed under initially primitive conditions , functional with a minimum of community features , and well set up for the real estate market . Clearly , other plan features , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any ultimate typology , but before long the typology grows too complex to manage . PLAN COMBINATIONS <p> Even with the relatively simple three-level , five-subtype hierarchical typology proposed here , 125 combinations of subcategories are theoretically possible . Fortunately , only forty-five of these emerge from the Oregonian evidence ( Figure 5 ) . Among these , one type was significantly more numerous than any other  --  twenty-five original plats or 12 percent of all towns analyzed , were designed with rectangular blocks without alleys , nestled snugly within the U.S. Survey grid . This plat type was durable , for it spanned the period from 1853 to 1911 . McMinnville , seat of Yamhill County , laid out in 1856 , is a larger representative of these , a four-by-four-block plat with two additional ones at one corner , containing eight lots per block , each lot measuring 60 feet frontage by 100 feet deep , and a uniform street width of 60 feet . William T. Newby from McMinnville , Tennessee settled the site in 1844 , built a mill in 1853 , and laid out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of town " with the announced purpose of furnishing liberal culture without the necessity of travelling far from home " ( Carey 1935 , 2 : 663 ) . Mostly , however , this straightforward plat type was favored for its simplicity in hamlet plats and whistle-stops . <p> The second most popular plat type , with seventeen cases , is identical to the first except that it is based on square blocks , with a similar longevity ( 1852-1910 ) . Monmouth , in Polk County , is an interesting example , with a four-by-four-block plan with eight lots per block , with block 10 set aside as the center of a Shelbyville central square . Two large parcels adjoining the plat to the north are designated " University Out Lots . " Several families from Monmouth , Illinois settled the vicinity with the express aim of founding a college town , using the proceeds of lot sales to endow Monmouth College , which was built on the outlots ( Polk County Historical Society 1987 , 22-23 ) . Curiously , the Illinois town from which the settlers came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this may be an instance of the simplification of town forms as their carriers moved westward . <p> The third most replicated plan type is the " railroad I-town , " with rectangular blocks and axial alleys that parallel the tracks , ranging in date from 1870 to 1914 . Gervais , laid out in Marion County in 1870 by Sam and Eliza Brown on the main trunk line of the Oregon and California Railroad southward up the Willamette Valley from Portland , represents the prototype . It was platted on an ambitious scale , a rectangle of seventy-nine blocks with a long central railroad reserve for depot grounds , with eight lots per block ( ranging from 30 to 50 feet wide and 100 feet deep ) , uniform streets 60 feet wide , and generous alleys 20 feet wide . The town plat is aligned with the railroad , which at this point angles through the countryside on a southwesterly bearing , at odds with the surrounding land parcels patterned on the U.S. survey grid . The plat itself would be emulated more than a dozen times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 offer one way of quantifying and identifying for comparative purposes the collective character of town origins in the Willamette Valley . Proprietors and surveyors mixed up their design features so much that there appears to be neither rhyme nor reason to the pattern , either categorical or geographical . However , even in this diversity definite preferences showed . In river towns , square blocks tended not to have alleys , whereas rectangular blocks did . Town plats set within the U.S. survey grid more often came without alleys , whereas railroad towns as a class tended to favor them . This raises the question of the timing and duration of design features in this region and how they might compare with others . CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCES AND REGIONAL PATTERN <p> Over time the introduction of town-design features to the region shows distinct sequences and variable durations ( Figure 6 ) . River fixations were necessarily dominant in the early period , drawn to sites that made good landings and thus obedient to meander patterns and nature 's geomorphological ways . The main period of fluvial town planning  --  the 1840s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most desirable sites in relation to farmland being opened up . If towns were still being placed on rivers and streams into the 1890s it was to develop the last substantial waterpower sites . Then came the orientation of inland towns to the surrounding land cadastre , whether within the metes-and-bounds informality of the DLC survey boundaries or the cardinal rigidity of the U.S. land survey . Strikingly , the U.S. grid fixed more inland towns than the DLC system , and for longer , because its reach away from initial settlement was greater . The remaining fixation force was the railroad , for four decades a magnet for town platting of the most slavish kind , creating several I-towns , but only where the rails were laid , which left an ample number of regional interstices for villages to spring up . <p> Block forms also followed a strong progression . Square city blocks flourished early and hung on , especially in smaller , out-of-the-way places , but rectangular blocks eventually prevailed , because they lessened the total amount of the town plat required for street space . Irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in plans of whistle-stop hamlets and places in the hillier margins of the valley , and graduated to the curvilinear forms common in the twentieth century . Similarly , alleys followed a sequence . Cross alleys were favored at first but fell victim to simple axial types , which themselves became virtually extinct after 1900 . <p> The regional distribution of plat fixation types at first glance looks scrambled but in fact possesses great geographical decorum ( Figure 7 ) . River fixations adorn the Willamette River and the short navigable portions of its main tributaries . The railroad-aligned towns also appear in short linear groups , as one would expect , and the remaining scatter of towns simply orient to the U.S. Survey grid and highways that made up the early and then late , peripheral central-place system of the valley . The distribution of block shape shows that both square and rectangular blocks typify all parts of the valley but occur in swarms , as if a neighborhood effect in surveying influence were operating , which could be significant . Seen in terms of shifting averages ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 200 by 200 feet to 200 by 300 feet , while plat size declined from an average of forty-three , to ten blocks by the end of the nineteenth century , and down to an average of three blocks by 1930 . Lot size stayed remarkably constant , at a very un-Pennsylvanian 50 by l00 feet , while street width declined from more than 68 feet to less than 43 feet , and alleys declined in favor from 70 to 35 percent of townsite coverage . The shrinkage in street space and the decline in urban space set aside for public use were probably consequences of intensifying pressures to maximize real estate returns on urban lot sales , and they clearly failed to anticipate the growing pressure on streets that the automobile would eventually exert . CROSS ALLEYS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE <p> Discussion here of town founding in the Willamette Valley has been largely structural and broad-gauge . Yet one intriguing discovery of the study  --  the introduction and lingering popularity of cross alleys in this Pacific Northwest region  --  invites concern for the individual agency involved . If alleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross alley seems to cry out for special acknowledgment and questions . Including alleys in block plans increased the surveyor 's task and added some complexity to the calculation of dimensions that would fit various modules of land , especially those within the U.S. Survey system of fixed-size original parcels . Therefore , incorporating cross alleys into a town plan was twice as labor-intensive as was including single alleys . They also carried cachet , for they allowed every lot to have public access on two sides of the property  --  a quality-of-life issue , it might be said . For cross alleys to appear in Oregon on the far western frontier at the outset of settlement when conditions were at their most primitive , therefore , is not a trivial statement . <p> Thirteen towns were platted with cross alleys . Oregon City , the oldest town in Oregon , was first platted with cross alleys within square blocks in the most vital " Lower Town " section by the Willamette Falls ( Figure 8 ) . The town 's founder was John McLoughlin , the Irish factor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bay Company . McLoughlin conceived the town 's layout in 1842 and engaged Jesse Applegate to survey the town and stake it out on the ground , which he did in the spring of 1844 ( Milne 1978 ) . ( n11 ) The fact that seven and one-half years later the town was replatted without cross alleys by John B. Preston , surveyor general of Oregon , in no way alters the importance of Oregon City as the portal through which the cross alley was introduced to the region , because it launched a local trend . <p> It is not clear whether McLoughlin or Applegate came up with the idea of including cross alleys in Oregon City 's plat . The portion of the plan lying in the Lower Town is a simple two-block-wide plat that snakes between the river below the falls and the high bluff facing it . It is easier to demonstrate familiarity with cross alleys as a planning concept in the case of the surveyor than that of the fur-company factor . Applegate had trained as a surveyor in the St. Louis office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one county-seat town  --  Butler , in Bates County  --  adjoining his home county of St. Clair was platted with cross alleys . Whatever the origin of the inspiration , Applegate was engaged the same year , 1844 , to lay out Champoeg , a second town some distance up the Willamette River that became Oregon 's Provisional Capital , where he also laid out cross alleys . <p> After this , diffusion upriver from Oregon City to Eugene between 1842 and 1851 was quick ( Figure 9 ) . Far from dying out  --  as the fashion did nationally  --  this distinctive alley type showed up in eight additional towns , as late as 1913 in the case of Hubert , northwest of Eugene . This alley form was tricky to lay out on the ground and gave up significant additional space as public right-of-way , so it is difficult to understand the attachment some latter-day town founders had for the form . The width of the alleys and the size of the blocks they appeared in varied noticeably , but with repetitions that suggest transfer of influence ( Table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of cross alleys seems to have followed social experience and personal links . Not all of the surveyors and proprietors have been researched for direct links , and in some cases the influence may have been indirect , but in three cases the story is clear . Applegate was born in Henry County , Kentucky near the Ohio River and , from the age of ten lived in Missouri , where he later became responsible for government surveys in the western part of the state . It is reasonably clear that he brought knowledge of the cross alley with him from the Midwest and certain that he applied such knowledge in the platting of Oregon City and Champoeg . <p> The second case is Philomen Vawter Crawford , a millwright by trade . He was born in 1814 and raised near Madison , Indiana , a town platted in 1810 with cross alleys ( Schmiedeler 2005 ) . After living in Oregon City , he went into partnership with Robert Finley to start a mill at Boston on the Calapooia River in 1858 , obtaining lumber from upriver ( Miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out an adjacent townsite and replicated the Oregon City block-and-alley form . Some years later Crawford bought land up the Calapooia River and started Crawfordsville , still enamored with the cross-alley type , even though by then practically everyone else used only axial alleys or none at all . The third case is that of Scio , a town platted in 1856 by settlers drawn from Scio , in southeastern Harrison County , Ohio  --  the county seat of which , Cadiz , has cross alleys  --  and Madison , Indiana , also a crossalley town ( Bates 1989 ) . These cases illustrate the capacity for urban forms to survive in a local social context in which people were free to be as much out of style as they might have thought that they were in style . CONTINENTAL COMPARISONS <p> The history of town founding and urban morphogenesis in Oregon 's Willamette Valley reveals various processes and patterns recognizable across the continent and some that , in their specific combinations , suggest a local flavor . The region studied was chosen for its strong frontier character at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition of settlers from the East and the Midwest in comparison with its Pacific neighbors , as well as for the great distances those settlers traveled in order to plant their new towns . The Willamette Valley serves as an excellent laboratory in which to observe the development of a multilayered urban system over time , with enough linearity to stretch out and make visible on the map stages in town accumulation and transportation cycles . The region reflected the general impact of economic cycles as well as the internal dynamics of an evolving urban hierarchy ( see Figure 2 ) . The system grew like a tree , extending its trunk southward up the Willamette River , spreading branches up side valleys and then , as spring turns to summer , adding the dense foliage all over the tree that completed the pattern ( see Figure 3 ) . <p> Although the Willamette Valley 's original town plans display extensive variation in detail , they fall recognizably into several broad categories familiar from older parts of the United States . Plat fixations developed first according to the logic of river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations , and lastly to railroad alignments , which sometimes followed survey lines but often preferred angled " crow-fly " paths between important destinations ( see Figure 4 ) . When one adds in the essential block and lot " texture " of plats , the true range of permutations emerges , and the region in this respect probably mirrors broad national patterns ( see Figure 5 ) . The frequency and amount of public space , as represented in public squares and reserves for community institutions , such as courthouses and academies , was lower in original plats here than it was in midwestern states , representing perhaps the stripping down to bare essentials of an urban-planning regime resulting from a weakening and thorough mixing of what back east had been more sharply distinct spatial traditions in the old New England , Midland , and southern culture hearth areas . Town founding in the Willamette Valley occurred during a period when the preference for the older square block was slowly yielding to the rectangular block as a more efficient real estate business model . The square block finally disappeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block had become established as the fashionable form . Similarly , cross alleys were popular in the antebellum period but lost out to the axial alley , which itself became virtually extinct by 1915 ( see Figure 6 ) . The geography of these types shows a thorough interdigitation , which argues for a well-distributed and relatively homogeneous " Oregon mixture " of plat features not unlike the relative uniformity Zelinsky argued for in defining the Pennsylvania town ( see Figure 7 ) . Statistics offer a benchmark ( see Table II ) , but the extent to which they might represent a set of western norms awaits comparative research . <p> The evidence for cross alleys in Oregon supports the view that some elaborate plan-design features did make it to the Far West intact and that this depended on surveyors and proprietors transplanting from the East forms with which they were familiar ( see Table III ) . That this form element spread up the Willamette Valley is clear , as is its lingering popularity there when it had most likely died out much earlier elsewhere ( see Figure 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleys is not yet known . They appear in isolated and haphazard fashion in some eastern Pennsylvania towns , but their dating has not been established . In Chester ( founded in 1644 ; refounded in 1682 ) and Westchester ( founded in 1683 ; today " West Chester " ) they occur as isolated cases in slowly evolving plats , suggesting that they provided access to lots in tight parcel resubdivisions . By the 1840s , railroad and coal interests in central Pennsylvania were platting unified grid towns , such as Tyrone and Coalmont , with standardized cross alleys . Cross alleys appeared in at least three Georgia towns : Madison , platted in 1809 ; Macon , platted in 1823 ; and Irwinville , platted in 1831 ( Sears 1979 , 100 , 140 , 175 ) . They became widespread in Ohio and Indiana during the same period , as Table IV shows , and spread farther in the Midwest. ( n12 ) So their appearance in Oregon is not completely surprising , but their frequency was low by the time they reached the Willamette Valley . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public squares . The Lancaster square never made it to Oregon , and the Shelbyville square , which did , was proportionately less important in town plats than its simplicity from a surveying standpoint might suggest . <p> This study shows that Zelinsky 's " different cargoes of town-building ideas " were carried westward and selectively diffused through the Willamette Valley , only to be superceded by later designs introduced by the railroads and land companies of the 1870s and 1880s . Thereafter , national styles spread quickly , though only after a certain time lag . Townsite proprietors and the surveyors they employed chose plat designs they were familiar with from particular locales in the East , as modified by local conditions , site circumstances , and the economic and social aspirations they had for their towns . As a result , many town-design ideas did manage to coexist side by side , sometimes for long periods of time . Ultimately they did fuse to some degree , and it is fair to characterize the Oregon town as having a much more open , loosely organized built environment than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us about Willamette towns in a broader context ? The evidence of original plat design and its changing composition during the period examined indicate that Oregon 's town-founding practices do represent a substantial blending of design traditions fomented in the several culture areas of the Eastern Seaboard and Midwest . They also suggest an Oregon , or at least Willamette Valley , town type closer to midwestern character than that which developed on the High Plains , where street widths , for example , whether from cattle-driving stimulus or not , were significantly wider than in the Ohio Valley-Great Lakes region ( Conzen 2004b ; Shortridge 2004 ) . Willamette town plans certainly owed nothing to Hispanic influence , although the term " plaza " is used locally to describe the public squares of at least two towns ( Amity and Dallas ) , perhaps a reflection of Oregonians returning from the California goldfields where they might have been exposed to the term 's use . Therefore , on the scale and with the town-plan features considered here , it is expected that the early Oregon town stands significantly apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to its south . And the spread of the Mormon town created a town-type region distinctly its own . Perhaps the American West does indeed display regional town character almost as complex and distinct as those of the long-settled East , notwithstanding the anaesthetizing claims of critics taken in by the superficial similarities of perceived railroad-borne urban monotony in the West . To document this more fully would be a fitting tribute to the idea of regional urban character proposed by Wilbur Zelinsky for the humble yet evocative Pennsylvania town . <p> This research was carried out while the author held the Benjamin H. and Louise L.
