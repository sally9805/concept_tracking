For a couple of months in that splendid late summer of 1998 , we all remembered the name of Roger Maris , as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa shattered his 1961 record of 61 home runs . The next year , however , when McGwire and Sosa surpassed the old record again , there was scant mention of the New York Yankee outfielder who had set it . Baseball , the media  --  we had all moved on . The former benchmark was no longer the benchmark . Then , last spring , the HBO movie 61* recreated Maris 's difficult record-breaking season , and his name was in the papers again , this time in the Arts &; Entertainment pages . There was a flurry of ads , reviews , and photos of a Roger look-alike swinging for the fences . But that too has passed , and as another season moves toward the play-offs and World Series , and as yet another slugger , Barry Bonds , has already topped the old mark , Roger , like those ancient , desultory games of April , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still savoring the sensational season that had recently ended , I was studying a map of Minnesota while spending the holidays in St. Paul . A sort of elongated mushroom , Minnesota is roughly bisected by Route I-94 . From the Twin Cities in the southeast , the highway cuts northwest , skirting St. Cloud , then goes on to Fargo , North Dakota  --  Roger 's home , the place where he is buried , and where I had heard that there was a Roger Maris Museum . I decided to make the trip . <p> I had never been a big Maris fan . Like every kid in New Jersey and what seemed like the rest of the world , in the 1960s I lived and breathed Mickey Mantle  --  his Herculean swings , his majestic going-going-GONE ! home runs , his crushing strikeouts , his speed , his easy smile , his jauntily cocked cap . And , oh , the injuries : the broken foot ; the torn , thinning cartilage in both knees ; the pain he " played through . " Mick was The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raked in candy around my subdivision while wearing an old pajama top with a huge number 7 Magic Marketed on the back . By the mid-1960s , when Mick was playing virtually crippled , I learned to tape my healthy legs with Ace bandages and bravely limp and grimace . His triumph and tragedy were mine . <p> Roger Maris never inspired such awe or empathy . He was the grim , sullen one with cold , wary eyes and a chip on his shoulder , his jaw set , his sleeves too short , and his hair a flattop , sharp as a bed of tacks . He looked like a hard-ass , possibly a hood . He probably would n't give you the time of day . His home runs , like BBs , flew into Yankee Stadium 's short right field porch , gone before you even saw them , with none of the arc and grandeur of Mick 's . They were " cheap shots , " my friends and I agreed . Roger could n't hit for average . His record was a freak . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed for the last week of that 1961 season , he surely would have dragged himself to the plate and smashed more homers than Maris . And then there was the long anticlimax , the ignoble remains of Roger 's career : the leg pulls , the hand injury that he could n't " play through , " and finally his two end-of-the-road seasons , in ' 67 and ' 68 , with the loathsome St. Louis Cardinals , the very team that in 1964 had ended all our Yankee glory and brought on the Dark Ages . No Jersey kid in his right mind would wear that number 9 . <p> Yet now I think more about Roger than I do about The Mick . His death from lymphoma in December 1985 was a surprising blow . And it was n't just because he was the first of my childhood Yankees to go , or that he had gone at the age of fifty-one , which increasingly strikes me as very young . Mick , whether discouraged , exuberant , or dissipated , was always a guy you thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He studied the ground as he circled the bases . After he hit his historic sixty-first home run , his teammates had to push him up the dugout steps to acknowledge , the cheers of the crowd . By 1962 , he was speaking to the media as briefly as possible . He seemed willfully to fade from view , disregarding our cheers and taunts , leaving us dangling and confused . And at the end of 1966 , after two injury-prone and lackluster seasons , he did in fact disappear  --  traded out west to that other league for a journeyman infielder named Charlie Smith , who had n't even made it with the Mets . <p> Central Minnesota , between St. Paul and Fargo , was smoothed by a succession of Ice Age glaciers , which left gentle , rolling plains of fertile soil . Today it is covered by vast farms and small towns , usually with miles between them . Stalky rows of corn and wheat , visible in the winter through a few inches of snow , follow the contours of the land . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sky . As you drive northwest on I-94 , past Alexandria and Fergus Falls , an immense , white distance surrounds you . You have no thoughts of New Jersey  --  to say nothing of the Bronx . Amazingly , this distance seems to widen as you approach Moorhead , the westernmost city in Minnesota , and enter the Red River Valley . It is n't really a valley , but the flat and loamy floor of the former Lake Agassiz , which covered this area in the Ice Age . To call it flat is not enough . Interrupted only by the stubbled crops , the rows straight and endless , the land looks more like that ancient , frozen lake . The Red River itself , as you leave Minnesota , is not visible beyond the bridge guardrails . But here and there little ranch houses soon appear , with frosted windows and smoke streaming from chimneys . When at noon I crossed into Fargo , it was minus three degrees Fahrenheit ( minus thirty-five with the windchill factor ) , and veils of snow were sweeping across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Fargo , and since then it has become the distribution center for a huge agricultural region , a market for wheat , oats , barley , corn , sugar beets , potatoes , cattle , and hogs . At about seventy-five thousand souls  --  just twenty thousand more than would fill Yankee Stadium  --  Fargo is the most populous city in North Dakota , with the state university , the Hector International Airport , the Fargodome , and , on the western outskirts , a replica pioneer village called Bonanzaville , USA , where tourists can stoop into sod houses . A mile south of Bonanzaville sprawls the West Acres Shopping Center , with a Sears , a Walgreens , and a Penney 's . It is like every other mall in America , an unlikely destination for anyone but shoppers and bored teenagers , except that here is the Roger Maris Museum . <p> Before visiting the museum I had lunch at The Granary , a mall restaurant done up with a hayloft and weathered boards to resemble a barn . I had a beer with my meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come from Austria to settle in Hibbing , Minnesota , in the Iron Range northwest of Duluth ; there he opened a tavern and served lager to thirsty miners . Not far from that tavern , Roger Eugene Maras was born in 1934 . His father held a low-wage job with the Northern Pacific , and five years later Roger would move with his parents and brother to Grand Forks , North Dakota , another railway town , and five years after that to Fargo . He would later change a letter in his last name , and during his playing career he would move his own family to a Kansas City suburb , and subsequently to Gainesville , Florida . But whatever he did , wherever he went , two things remained constant : that bristling flattop and the beer . After a Yankee game , Roger would have a couple of Ballantines and a cigarette whose brand he was paid to endorse . As a Cardinal he would play for Gussie Busch , the beer baron owner , who set him up with an Anheuser-Busch distributorship when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer until the day he died . In a sense he continued selling it . Until 1997 , if you lived in central Florida and ordered a couple of cases or kegs , you 'd get them by way of the Maris Distributing Corporation , run by Roger 's brother , Rudy . <p> The Roger Maris Museum is off the main mall corridor , near the entrance of the Sears and opposite the John Deere tractor outlet . It is not a museum in the usual sense . You do n't pay to enter , or pass through a turnstile . You do n't go from room to room , and you ca n't become a member . It 's just there , unattended , along the tan brick wall between Spencer Gifts and the A-1 Pet Center : a ten-foot-high , seventy-two-foot-long glass-fronted display case , not unlike an extra-large trophy case that might stand outside the locker rooms in any regional high school . <p> Jim McLaughlin and Bob Smith , two Legionnaires from Fargo Post No. 2 , hatched the idea at a breakfast meeting during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger and his friend and fellow flattopped Yankee , first baseman Bill " Moose " Skowron , had been invited . According to Jim , Roger said he had some old photos and trophies in his rec room in Gainesville , but did n't want to make a public display of them . But Moose Skowron urged him to , and the following fall , when Roger learned he had cancer , he agreed to help plan the museum with the local Legionnaires . Driving a U-Haul , Jim and Bob brought back to Fargo a hundred and sixty items from Roger 's rec room , and on June 23 , 1984 , with Roger , Moose , and all of Post No. 2 crammed into the corridor , the mayor of Fargo made a short speech , and the lights in the display case came on . <p> Today the museum is still stunning in its modesty and in what I can only call its loving attention to detail  --  to every dustless , shining trophy and plaque , every wood-framed photo , every neatly labeled historic bat and ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-size plastic model . Stunning , too , is its uncomplicated vision of Roger 's life . Here you will not find references to his struggles with the New York press ; his bitter silences ; his reputation as " Red-assed Roger , " the angry , callous , or indifferent young man who turned his back on certain old-timers and reporters , and who , after failing to run out a routine grounder in a nationally televised game in 1963 , flashed his middle finger at jeering fans in Minneapolis , some of whom had driven 250 miles from Fargo to attend . <p> The museum presents a kinder , gentler Roger , one I had seldom heard of : the hometown kid who married his high school sweetheart and never forgot his humble Midwestern roots . Here , interspersed with baseball memorabilia , hang photographs of his winsome family , of Roger as a middle-aged man in a gray suit shaking hands with children in a local hospital . As curator Jim McLaughlin 's Web site describes it , the museum is " a permanent shrine to a reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relive Roger 's legendary life every minute the mall is open . " <p> There is so much here  --  and much of it from so long before Roger came to the Yankees and entered our lives . Medals , rings , watches , pennants . Roger 's nappy varsity letters from Bishop Shanley High , where as a football star he once ran back four kickoffs for touchdowns , still a national record . There are stats and stats . Photos and photos . At a local service station , as a teenager pumping gas on weekends . Or talking earnestly with Sister Bertha , a portly nun who was one of his teachers . In another photo he stands alone in the outfield against a vast sky  --  a Class C rookie in the baggy uniform of the Fargo-Moorhead Twins , with hairless forearms and a puny glove half the size of the ones today . Then he 's in team pictures with the Class B Iowa Kernels , the AA Reading Indians , the AAA Indianapolis Indians , and finally , in 1957-58 , with the big-league tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City , where , according to Maris 's 1962 autobiography ( Roger Maris at Bat , with Jim Ogle ) , he was most comfortable during his early baseball years  --  in another Midwest river town , where press and fans were easygoing , and where he could live privately with his growing family ( he had two kids by then ) . In the photos and baseball cards from this period , he does n't seem particularly happy . He wears his usual serious , impenetrable look , his face like a chiseled stone . Yet the skin beneath his eyes is light and smooth , and he still has a youthful , promising , essentially untroubled look that he would lose once he came to New York . <p> But to New York he did come , twenty-five years old , unwillingly traded in 1960 , leaving behind his kids and his wife , who was pregnant again . And it was during that year , and especially during the next two , that staggering success , competitive pressure , and the glare of media scrutiny made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy and juicy personal tidbits ; Roger , devoid of wit or guile , would say in his slow , monotonous voice that no , he was n't feuding with Mantle , and no , he did n't " play around " on the road , and yes  --  for the hundredth time  --  it was a hanging curve ball that he had hit . " There were many times during the 1961 season , " his autobiography records , " when I did feel I was ready to crack up . " His hair began falling out . He broke out in rashes . To avoid the public , he hid in hotel rooms . By turns , he grudgingly cooperated with , tried to ignore , griped to , and was overly honest with reporters , who then printed every awkward , embarrassing word . All this is much chronicled , but is barely in evidence at the museum , unless you get close to the photos and look at Roger 's eyes , at their pouched and haunting darkness . <p> However ill at ease he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascade of trophies and other symbols of achievement that have since come to rest in the museum . Plaques remind us that Roger was the American League 's Most Valuable Player for 1960 and 1961 . And there he is , the most unlikely of cultural icons , belting a round-tripper on the front of a Wheaties box . Other artifacts make your eyes pop . Impaled on the pedestal of the 1960 Gold Glove Award is a life-size Rawlings glove , wide open as if to snare a line drive , apparently fashioned of pure gold ( though I suspect it is spray-painted leather ) . A few feet away , coiled like a cobra , lies the massive Hickok Belt awarded to the best professional athlete of 1961 . The belt resembles a piece of professional wrestling gear . Its golden buckle measures four inches wide ; its weight would almost topple a man . The crowning trophy , however , is in fact a crown : the 1961 Sultan of Swat Award . Tall and golden , it might indeed be suited to a sultan , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is decorated with crossed bats and surmounted by five baseball diamonds , each with a jewel set into its pitcher 's mound . In a photo of Roger accepting the crown , he 's hefting it with both hands above his flattop . He looks a little dazed and dubious , not sure if he should try the thing on . <p> More tellingly than the trophies , the displays of statistics and photos of Roger in action remind us of who and what he was during this period . Not flashy , not graceful . Not what you would call intuitive , inspired , or inspiring . Just a grooved , precise , and methodical wonder that for a time simply kept going and going . Never mind his overall batting averages . Look at his stats with men in scoring position ( .400-plus for three years running ! ) . Or look at his slugging averages ( .581 in 1960 , .620 in 1961 ) , or at his lifetime fielding percentage ( .982 , better than Babe Ruth 's , Joe DiMaggio 's , or Henry Aaron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Better yet , study the photo sequence of Roger 's swing . Notice how compact , controlled , and level it is . No Reggie Jackson windmill theatrics . No vicious Mark McGwire uppercuts or cute Sammy Sosa hops , skips , or jumps . This is a pure thing of geometrical beauty . At the instant when Roger 's bat meets the ball , his hips have opened ; his front ( right ) leg is fully extended and is in perfect line with his back-slanting torso . Then , from his shoulders , his arms also make a line , straight out , horizontal as a prairie , a line that continues through the bat to the ball . All of Roger went to that point of impact . Nothing in his swing was extra . It was what my father , an unassuming man not given to flourishes or overexertion himself , always called a " quick , sweet swing . " <p> Now look closely at Roger 's ropy , flowing arm muscles . How odd they seem : thick , but somehow underdeveloped . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today 's sluggers . These muscles came honestly with the work of hitting , and with the beer and crabs that came afterward . " I was trying to do my job , " Roger 's book reminds us time and again . Why encumber yourself with more than you need to do a job well ? <p> Then look at the photos of Roger at the pinnacle of success , circling the bases after his sixty-first home run . His head is down . There is no outward exultation , no upraised arms , no leaps or fists pumping the air . As he did after every other homer he hit as a Yankee , Roger shakes hands at third base with coach Frank Crosetti , and at the plate with the next man in the order , who on this day is Yogi Berra . There are no game-stopping celebrations , no on-field hugs from the kids , no photo-op smooching , say , with Mrs. Babe Ruth . Such events did n't happen in 1960s baseball , and they would have been unimaginable for Roger . Straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps with a hint of relief , like a man turning into his driveway after a long day at the office . <p> He was happy , of course . " As happy , " he would write , " as it is possible for any person to be . " When his teammates pushed him up the dugout steps , only briefly  --  and sheepishly , it appears in the photos  --  did he wave his cap to the crowd . For Roger happiness was a private emotion to be shared with a small circle of family and friends , and pride was more private still . All the attention , his book tells us , was " embarrassing . " It made him out to be more or less than he was , and he thought it showed up his teammates . Was this false modesty ? I think not . In part , it must have come with the territory , with living in a place as cold , flat , and wide as Fargo , where on a winter 's day the sky is so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you ca n't do anything  --  ca n't even hurry across a windy parking lot  --  without realizing how small you are . How can you not sense that anything you accomplish will be swept away in time ? <p> Slowly at first , Roger 's productivity on the field diminished , and precipitously his relations with the press degenerated . He was quoted in the spring of 1962 as saying , " I 'm through with being a nice guy . " He turned down photo sessions with old-timers he did n't like , and at least once he failed to show for a press interview . In nationally syndicated columns , he was called an " ingrate , " a " whiner , " a man of " treacherous smallness . " In Sports Illustrated , Robert Creamer wrote of " a petulant , self-pitying , constantly irritated man , " and Roger grew quieter and more withdrawn . Still , in 1962 he hit 33 home runs , with 100 runs batted in , an outstanding year by almost any measure  --  unless you had hit 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Things got worse in 1963 , the year of the upraised middle finger  --  one of the seemingly few parts of Roger 's anatomy that remained fully operational . A back injury , muscle pulls , and a strained elbow limited him to 90 games and 23 home runs . And while he improved a bit in 1964 , the year the Cardinals did us in , the bottom fell out in 1965 , when Roger broke his hand and the Yankee management acknowledged the injury only belatedly . That season he hit just eight home runs , and was routinely booed at home and away as the club compiled its first losing record in forty years . Then , in 1966 , the unthinkable happened . The Yankees finished dead last . In teenage despair , I lost interest in the team  --  and so , it appears , did Roger . In September he had a talk with manager Ralph Houk . According to Houk , Roger said he was quitting : " He was sick of the booing , sick of playing in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except for the bats he used in the ' 63 and ' 64 World Series , there is little in the museum from this period of decline . In December 1966 , the Yankees quietly traded Roger to the Cardinals , back to yet another Midwest river town , where less was expected of him and he could spend more time with his family  --  he now had six kids . In St. Louis he was apparently quite happy , out of the spotlight , a steady , no-more-than-average player who helped get his team to the World Series each of the two years he was there . <p> By then I was in high school , way too cool to dress up as a Yankee on Halloween , and baseball was n't much on my mind . Still , I remember one October evening in 1968 when , in the midst of my homework , I went into our kitchen . My father , in his plaid shirt and rumpled corduroys , was watching TV . The Series was on , and at that moment Roger came to bat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see it to this day . Just a year before Woodstock , Roger still had his flattop , but he did n't look the same . He had a paunch . He moved as if his feet hurt , and he did n't swing as hard as he once had . He struck me as incalculably old , like certain men of what is now my age who hang out in hardware stores . He also seemed to be wearing a costume , which turned out to be a Cardinal uniform with those terrible birds perched on a bat across his chest . He still wore the same number he had as a Yankee , and that was the most disconcerting thing . In an arch above the big 9 on his back , it said , incredibly , MARIS . <p> A life-size plastic model wears that Cardinal uniform now , and you 'll see it as you near the Spencer Gifts end of the museum . Beyond that hang photos of Roger after his playing days : as a beer businessman in his Gainesville office or teeing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed his new life , made a good living , spent time with his family , and did little to attract attention . It took the suasion of George Steinbrenner to get him back to Yankee Stadium in 1978 for a flag-raising ceremony and then for Old Timers ' Day . In a photo with Whitey Ford , Mickey Mantle , and Joe DiMaggio , Roger stands on the field , taking in the applause , a middle-aged man squeezed into a young man 's uniform . Between bouts of chemotherapy , he made his last return in 1984 for a ceremony to retire his number . On a day when only the best is remembered and the rest , for the moment , is put aside , he again seems relaxed and pleased . His face , however , appears pale and doughy , a look that , with a jolt , I recognize in my father , who lives with leukemia now . A year after this photo Roger would die , but in this instant he is very much alive . Neither the cancer nor the chemo has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the display case is an addendum : a TV monitor running a continuous loop of interviews with Roger , one from his Yankee days , others from later in his life . They are less than scintillating , and as I listened , I focused less on the meaning of Roger 's words than on the way he said them . His voice was indeed soft , slow , and flat-toned , which to my ear seemed to imply a dull indifference to the question , to the interviewer , even to himself . At worst , it sounded like the grudging sullenness for which he was so notorious . " That Maris , " an irked Casey Stengel , his manager in 1960 , once said . " You 'd tell him something , and he 'd stare at you for a week without answering . " No wonder Roger drove New York reporters nuts , especially if they were writing on deadline . <p> Yet as you listen to Roger 's voice mingle with the voices of shoppers heading for Sears or of farmers admiring John Deere tractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullen . Here Roger is not an oddity . He speaks in what linguists call a Northern dialect ( the one ridiculously exaggerated in the movie Fargo ) , in which patterns of pronunciation , stress , and intonation methodically flatten the language . Vowels are given narrower range , Rs never roll , and frequent pauses invite others to respond . To me , Roger sounded like everyone else at the mall , and I doubted that those busy shoppers were all sullen and disengaged . Despite the drone of their voices , they seemed quite animated . <p> " We ... treasure our world-champion slow talkers , " writes Kathleen Norris in her book Dakota , " people who speak as if God has given them only so many words to use in a lifetime , and having said them they will die . " Plains speech does n't waste words or show off . It seems to trust what comes with waiting . Roger could be stubborn , prickly , and uncommunicative , especially toward people he did n't know . But at times we may have misread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , or his dull lack of character , may simply have been his Northern dialect . <p> It was getting on toward dusk , and the temperature had dropped to minus eleven , when I left West Acres and drove about a mile east to 1510 Thirteenth Avenue South , where Roger and his family once lived . In a neighborhood of almost identical structures on identical lots , the house was painfully neat and small : single-story , squat and square , with white trim and blue fiberboard shingles . It could n't have been more than twenty-five feet wide . Its snow-covered roof was almost flat . The house barely seemed to emerge from the earth , a northern plains house , a variant of the sod house in which you hunker down against the sky . Through the front-door window I could make out a cramped living room with a Christmas tree and a couch . The short driveway was shoveled ; fresh rock salt covered the concrete step , yet no inside lights were on , and no one answered the bell . When Roger lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few more blocks of houses  --  then nothing !  --  between here and places like Bismarck . I rang the bell again . I went around back to the tiny yard and called over the fence . But all was quiet , except for the wind , which tore at a sheet of plastic covering one of the windows . I gave up and returned to my frosted car , thinking how strange it might feel to find yourself in New York City when this had been your home . <p> Before starting back toward St. Paul , I made a detour north , out near the airport , where again the prairie opens wide . On a narrow dirt road , with the lights of the runways beyond a fence to my right , I turned into Holy Cross Cemetery . It was dark now , the snow a little deeper than in town , and for a few moments I drove slowly along , with my high beams sweeping the headstones . Then I saw it , beneath a small tree . I stopped and got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I had never seen a grave quite like it . A long foundation supports a small , light-gray stone , which in turn upholds a glinting black diamond , a polished slab of granite about four feet high , standing on one end . The diamond , of course , is a baseball diamond , though it has no bases or batter 's boxes . At its center , MARIS is incised in a rectangle the shape of a pitching rubber ; in the bottom corner , near where home plate would be , Roger 's etched figure blasts his historic sixty-first homer with that familiar geometric swing . <p> It 's a good gravestone , as gravestones go . A lot like the person beneath it . All straight lines , sharp edges , and hard right angles . No fancy scrollwork or festooned flowers , no Dearly Beloveds , no scriptural passage that he might not have known . Not even a cross . Just his name , that image of what he did best , and along the lip of the foundation , the words AGAINST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have been appreciated by Roger  --  a man who , when presented with a sterling silver dish at a banquet , stood to accept it and , according to the writer Robert Creamer , said , " Thank you for this platter . " Then he took his seat . <p> One of the more overt messages of the Roger Maris Museum is that Roger deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame . Beneath the TV monitor are stacks of pamphlets , some of which urge you to write to the Veterans Committee in Cooperstown . " Here 's What You Can Do , " begins one of these pamphlets , and you 'll find sample letters arguing that Roger should be elected . I will not get into that argument here , and besides , it 's too late . In March 2001 , when the Veterans Committee last voted , Roger 's name did not appear on the final old-timers ' ballot . Barring a miracle , he wo n't make the Hall of Fame . <p> This saddens me , but not that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enshrined here on the flat floor of Lake Agassiz than among the rolling moraines and fingering lakes of central New York State . His own land bespeaks him , and so do its people . In words as direct , befuddling , and true as those of Yogi Berra , Don Gooselaw , a lifelong friend , says of him : " Roger was just Roger all the time . " Always a guy from Fargo . <p> So to get to Roger , you have to get here . And while Fargo may be more inconvenient for many than Cooperstown , the people who must get here do  --  or are here already . In a dented patch of snow on the foundation of the grave , right below the diamond and above the word ODDS , I found a baseball that night . Evidently it had been there a long time ; it was frozen to the stone . At one point it must have been waterlogged with rain , then repeatedly frozen and thawed or sun-baked , for it was distended , like an avocado . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could believe those brave words , but they 're untrue  --  at least for most of us . Roger was a straightforward , unpretentious man , yet unlike our more lasting heroes , he was utterly without charisma or flash , a bore in our media age . He was no larger or more colorful than the general lot of us , except that for a couple of years he could really hit a baseball . Even at his zenith , he reminds us of the ordinariness of life and of what we usually are : not heroic , not altogether pretty or pleasant , but capable of a certain modest dignity that comes less from having achieved than from having persevered for a while . So he is receding once more from our collective memory , and soon he may recede from my own . Always a shadow , he is now eclipsed  --  though I have the sense that the last place he 'll recede from will be this one . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Roger Maris <p> By William Loizeaux <p> <p> William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland .
