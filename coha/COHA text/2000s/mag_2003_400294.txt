The World Bank/IMF takeover , in four easy steps , by Greg Palast // Green-haired protesters in the streets of Seattle were ridiculed for their belief that the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the world 's finance ministers enter into secret agreements to impoverish developing nations . Here , in fact , is one such agreement : Argentina 's " Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report " from June 2001 . This document , nominally produced by the World Bank , represents the interlocking directives of both the Bank and the IMF , as well as , indirectly , the wishes of both institutions ' largest patron , the United States Treasury Department . Marked " Confidential " or " Official Use Only , " these reports are seldom publicized to the citizenry bound up in their stipulations . Yet for the 100-plus nations that rely on IMF and World Bank loans-countries such as Argentina , Tanzania , Ecuador , Sierra Leone-such agreements serve as de facto legislation , meticulous in detail and ideological in thrust . Although couched as loan conditions or as helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a financial coup d'etat . At the outset , the authors of this Argentina report pause to reflect on how their strategy had performed in the past year . Twelve months prior , in June 2000 , unemployment stood at 15 percent ; the country had already suffered through two years of recession , during which industrial production had declined by more than 10 percent . To cut government spending in such an economy is akin to turning off the engines of an airplane in stall . And yet in a September 2000 agreement with the IMF , Argentina had been required to cut its budget deficit from $5.3 billion in 2000 to $4.1 billion in 2001 . The consequences were predictable : such " austerity " had led , in the first three months of 2001 , to a 2.6 percent decline in GDP from the previous year . To reduce its deficit per IMF decree , Argentina had cut $3 billion from government spending-a cut that was necessary , the authors note here , to " accomodate the increase in interest obligations . " These obligations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign creditors , including the IMF and World Bank themselves . Since 1994 , in fact , Argentina 's budget deficits were entirely attributable to interest payments on foreign loans . Excluding such payments , spending had remained constant at 19 percent of GDP . Despite the visible harm caused by cuts , the new plan ordered more . This , the report promised , would " greatly improve the outlook for the remainder of 2001 and for 2002 , with growth expected to recover in the later half of 2001 . " The Bank was slightly off the mark . By December 2001 , Buenos Aires ' middle class , unaccustomed to hunting the streets for garbage to eat , joined the poor in mass demonstrations . How had Argentina arrived at such an impasse ? In the 1990s the nation was the poster child for globalization , having followed without question the IMF and World Bank program . The " reform " plan for Argentina , as for every nation , had four steps . The first of these , capital-market liberalization , was achieved by 1991 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-toone relationship with the U.S. dollar . This peg was designed both to keep inflation low and to make deficit spending difficult , in hopes of attracting and comforting foreign investors . Liberalized markets free capital to flow in and out across borders . But once Argentina 's economy began to wobble , money simply flowed out . In July 2001 , for example , Argentina bled out 6 percent of the nation 's bank deposits : in panic , Argentines were withdrawing their convertible pesos as dollars , which the government was forced to borrow back at more than 20 percent to maintain the one-to-one-exchange rate . To finance this lopsided trade in the Yankee dollar , Argentina was forced to cut government pensions and salaries by 13 percent . In 2000 , Ecuador did Argentina one better and " dollarized " - i.e. , adopted the U.S. dollar as currency-causing the purchasing power of wages to fall by half . The second step in the IMF/World Bank regimen is privatization . Both at the urging of lenders and out of financial necessity , Argentina throughout the nineties sold off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " grandmother 's jewels : the state 's oil , gas , water , and electric companies and the state banks . It was quite a fire sale . Vivendi of France won rural water systems ; Enron of Texas , the pipes of Buenos Aires ; Fleet of Boston took the provincial banks . By the panic of 2001 , there was nothing left to sell : " Almost all major public utilities have been privatized , " this memo laments elsewhere . Vivendi raised water prices as much as 200 percent ; Enron , too , demanded rate increases , even as its water was inadequately cleaned and its service plagued by interruptions . Former chief World Bank economist Joseph Stiglitz says the wholesale privatizations ordered by the Bank and IMF were so corrupt that he dubbed them " briberizations . " Argentina 's former public-works minister claims that , in 1988 , an Enron lobbyist offered to " take care " of him if he would sell rights to the nation 's natural gas for a fifth of the world price . In 1994 , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social-security system , diverting much of it into private accounts . The U.S.-based Center for Economic and Policy Research calculated the revenue loss from this decision alone to be almost equal to the nation 's deficits during the period . The third prong of the laissez-faire putsch is market-based pricing . In Argentina the main target of this initiative has been labor , that most inflexible of commodities . " A major advance was made to eliminate out dated labor contracts , " states this report , noting approvingly that " labor costs " ( i.e. , wages ) had fallen due to " labor market flexibility induced by the de facto liberalization of the market via increased informality . " Translation : workers who lost unionized jobs were forced into ad hoc arrangements , with far less protection . Here , the report asks the government to decentralize collective bargaining , a move that would further reduce union power . In Tanzania , when the nation 's HIV epidemic was beginning in the early nineties , the IMF and World Bank required the government to charge " user fees " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such fees in Dar es Salaam in 1994 , the number of patients treated in the city 's three largest public hospitals dropped by 53 percent . Bowing to pressure , the Bank has in recent years retreated from its demands for user fees . In June 2000 it noted in frustration that , despite its efforts , market reforms had failed to win over the Tanzanians : " One legacy of socialism is that most people continue to believe the State has a fundamental role in promoting development and providing social services . " Far from achieving this goal of " unemployment in single digits , " the World Bank and IMF saw the jobless figure in the Buenos Aires area rise from 17 percent to a staggering 22 percent in the year after this report 's issuance . The violence and looting that rocked the city in December 2001 thus represents a stage in the " austerity " process that Stiglitz terms the " IMF riot . " When a nation , he said , " is down and out , the IMF takes advantage and squeezes the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat until , finally , the whole cauldron blows up . " A similar situation gripped Indonesia in 1998 , when , after the IMF ordered a reduction in food subsidies , Jakarta erupted in fiery riots . In some cases the insurrection is literally written into the plan . Under the terms of Ecuador 's 2000 agreement with the IMF , the country was required to raise the price of cooking gas by 80 percent ; the Bank 's strategy report for the same year , meanwhile , acknowledged that " social unrest can not be ruled out " if such plans were implemented . One can not accuse the Bank of inaccuracy . In early 2001 a hungry and impoverished Indian population descended from the Andes and burned cars in Quito . The report had counseled authorities to meet its detractors with " political resolve " ; which , as a practical matter , meant troops in the streets . Step four of the IMF/World Bank program is free trade . The loan terms of the two institutions had required Argentina to accept " an open trade policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whose products were effectively priced , via the peg , in U.S. dollars-were forced into a spectacularly unequal competition against Brazilian goods priced in that nation 's devalued currency . Argentina grows a special kind of long-grain rice favored by Brazilians , and yet even as Brazil faced a hunger crisis tons of rice went unsold . One of the Bank 's first ventures into " liberalizing " African markets was in Ghana , which was directed to end price subsidies for its cotton production ; a Bank report from May 2002 admitted that this has left the Ghanaian cotton industry " close to collapse . " In a footnote , the same report observed that under the new U.S. farm bill , the share of a typical American farm 's cotton revenue that is derived from subsidies will rise to 45 percent . Stiglitz likens the West 's hypocritical free-trade policies to the Opium Wars , noting , " That too was about opening markets . " Although they make demands separately , the IMF , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization have become interchangeable masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be members of the IMF , which requires its borrowers to adhere to WTO rules . It is perhaps not a coincidence , then , that the " triggers " of these loans so often are friendly to the interests of Western corporations . In Ecuador 's 2000 CAS report , the country 's loan was triggered only after it permitted the construction of a controversial gas pipeline over the Andes that had long been sought by British Petroleum . In Sierra Leone , one of the " performance criteria " imposed by the IMF in 2001 was that the nation stop requiring import licenses on foreign-made cigarettes . A study by a Harvard economist found that the IMF alone held borrowing nations to an average of eighty-one " conditionalities " or other requirements . Although these reports rarely fail to couch their fiats in terms of " reducing poverty , " their performance in Argentina on this score is sadly typical . Before 1980 , when the World Bank and IMF set out to rearrange the economies of developing nations , nearly all of them adhered to Keynesianism or socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally owned industry through government investment , behind a protective wall of tariffs and capital controls . In those supposed economic dark ages , spanning roughly from 1960 to 1980 , per-capita income grew by 73 percent in Latin America and by 34 percent in Africa . By comparison , since 1980 , Latin American income growth has slowed to a virtual halt-to less than 6 percent over twenty years-while African incomes have declined by 23 percent . The IMF itself , in a statement accompanying its April 2000 " World Economic Outlook " report , noted that " in recent decades , too many countries , and nearly one-fifth of the world population , have regressed .... This is arguably one of the greatest economic failures of the 20th Century . " On this , at least , the IMF had it right . // // Author Affiliation Greg Palast reports for BBC 's Newsnight and the Guardian newspapers .
