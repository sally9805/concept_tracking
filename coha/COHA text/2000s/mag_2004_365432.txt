So-called whole-body scans were originally used as a last-resort diagnostic tool to find hidden tumors in patients with cancer . But then the tests caught on among the healthy hypervigilant , who were drawn in growing numbers to walk-in clinics by aggressive TV and radio ads . In 2002 , two years after Oprah Winfrey got scanned  --  and bubbled enthusiastically about the experience  --  32 million Americans shelled out as much as $1,000 apiece to get their bodies X-rayed in thin slices and reassembled into 3-D images detailed enough to show every blemish , scar and incipient tumor . The numbers are down slightly , owing to the economic downturn and , perhaps , repeated warnings that if you are relatively healthy , the scans will probably do you more harm than good . <P> But how much harm was n't clear until last week , when a team of scientists at Columbia University reported in the journal Radiology precisely how much radiation you are exposed to in a single full-body scan .

According to David Brenner , lead author of the study , the risks associated with just one scan are relatively modest , likely to increase your chances of dying from a radiation-caused cancer to about 0.08% . But if you were to get scanned every year for 30 years , your risk of developing a radiation-related tumor would jump significantly , to about 1 in 50 . <P> Most Americans are not getting annual scans  --  and now presumably even fewer will . Although full-body scans may still make sense for some patients , whatever information your doctor needs can usually be obtained by less extensive X rays  --  scanning just the kidney , for example , if what you are looking for is kidney cancer . Minimal scanning will also cut down on the chances that you 'll find a growth that requires more invasive testing but turns out  --  and it usually does  --  to be perfectly benign . <P> There 's a lesson here for all of us , doctors and patients alike : we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighing both the benefits and the risks . <P> Sanjay Gupta is a neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent
