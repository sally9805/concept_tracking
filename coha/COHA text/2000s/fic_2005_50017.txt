The crusade had been brewed up over empty stomachs and ulcer bomb margaritas made from reconstituted lime juice and ice cubes older than the tequila . Bob 's tequila-idea plan was simple : He-we-would become minor anecdotes by driving to El Paso , Texas , finding Cormac McCarthy at the pool table , challenging him to a game of eight-ball , beating him , then walking into the neon infamy of morning having whupped what Bob called " the best living writer to ever live . " <p> " This , " Bob said , " will ensure us our very own asterisk in the annals of American letters . " He studied my face for a moment . " How hard can it be ? " <p> " Damn hard , " I said . <p> " He 's a shark , for sure-I 'm not gon na try to pull any wool about that . " Bob was talking as if he knew this guy , had scouted him out . " He 's beatable . " <p> " I just do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Detroit with better Mexican food . We 'll find nothing but trouble there . You 've heard the song . " <p> " You been there ? " Bob said . An El Paso notch in my pistol grip would have impressed him . <p> " No , " I said . " I 've read about it . " <p> " Yeah , me , too . " His eyes wide green shooter marbles of possibility . " But that 's why Cormac 's the real deal . He could afford to live anywhere . The Big Apple . Key West . Palm Springs . A three-story cabin in the middle of the town square in Jackson Hole , for chrissakes . But he 's too leathery and steely for those velvet-codpiece puff towns . " <p> " Velvet codpiece ? You got ta quit reading for a while . " <p> " That 's what I 'm getting at . Cormac walks the streets of El Paso , baby ! " <p> The man with the little hammer had paid us both a visit . Mid-morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but what I think may have been a housecoat to cover up with-on the shag carpet on the living room floor . Bob had sprung with new life from his own couch to make pancakes since Allison was still at the hospital , working , but would have made them for us had she been home . Not only did Bob remember the idea best left in the tequila tank , but he started making on-the-ground plans right along with the just-add-water pancake batter as if I remembered all of this cockamamie plan , too , and no further discussion would be necessary . Oh , how simple it would be : We 'd drive his 1972 Volvo from Laramie to El Paso , find the wordsmith at the tables , and take his lunch money and with it a story that would last us the rest of our lives . " He 's good , " Bob said . " Semi-pro quality , I hear . " <p> " Where do you hear this stuff ? " <p> " You know , Cormac chatrooms . " <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . Then there 's the Cormac McCarthy Society , but that 's kind of officious , and they do n't talk much about pool . " <p> " How do you blog about a writer ? " Bob looked at me like I was a blank sheet of typing paper . " How would us beating him even be in the cards ? " <p> " We practice . " <p> " Hold on , " I said . " Running a ' semi-pro pool hustler ' from El Paso , Texas , is way different than beating peewee league-play eight-bailers from Wheatland . " <p> " Why , " Bob said . <p> " Just a feeling I get . " <p> " Maybe we 're on our game and Cormac 's off his . " <p> " Or vice versa . " <p> " Naw , we 'll have the momentum of travel on our side . Wyoming road men coming to your town , unannounced . " <p> " Never mind his home-table advantage , huh . " We followed through , anyway . Even after Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out just fine if we took the Flower Ranger van instead . The van was my work vehicle , before we took it to Texas . A i99O-something Dodge minivan , new-banana green with the red Flower Ranger bucking bronco bouquet airbrushed on both sides . <p> " What we really need is a hearse , " Bob said . " You know , for intimidation . Would n't even have to break down our cues . But this 'll do . It 's like something Harrogate would drive . " Harrogate being Bob 's favorite character of literature , the off-his-nut Tennesseean who goes to jail for violating muskmelons in Cormac 's novel Suttree . Huck Finn on a hearty diet of lead paint . <p> Bob is one of those guys who are led around by their obsessions as if obsession were a weather balloon and Bob was tethered to it at the navel with parachute chord . Some days the wind is up . Some days it 's howling . The term " fanatic " is a bit mild when talking about Bob 's affliction for Cormac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be for , say , Eric Clapton . No , it 's worse than that . Bob has read Cormac 's Suttree twenty-two times and plans to read it again . " I figure I 've got sixty more years in me before I 'm quit of this world , " Bob says . " Conservatively figuring if I read it twice a year , that 's one hundred twenty more times . One hundred forty-two total . " <p> I read Suttree once . Most of it . I guess I liked it fine , especially the carp-fishing scenes . It seems to me that you leave a book with the immediacy of life , and it lasts for about an hour or so . But then after three or four days turn into weeks and months , you look back on the book when you see it there under coffee cups and beer bottles or leveling up a card table or even tucked back on the shelf next to cookbooks and telephone directories and self-help manuals on how to improve your marriage , and there 's only one image-Ishmael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The Suttree image I hold is of Harrogate , overalls down around his ankles , moonlight reflecting off his hairy peach ass , violating those muskmelons . <p> " It 's a Southern thing , " Bob says , as if that should explain it , no need to keep beating that dead horse . <p> To tell you the truth , I never even finished All the Pretty Horses , even though Bob gave it to me on six cassette tapes that read " Books on Tape for the Visually Impaired . Property of Albany County Library . " I played it in the van for a while , but kept ejecting due to that feeling that news was fomenting out there in the world and I might be missing something on the AM . <p> " He must be an athlete with a pool cue , an extension of his genius pen , " Bob said . " A dancer with a fencing foil . Anyone who writes like that . He 's insane . Mad . Captain Ahab of the Chihuahuan Desert . " Bob has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hitting me when he talks about this guy we 're driving seven hundred miles one-way to shoot against-that is , if we can find him . " It 's not like he 's out on a book tour somewhere , " Bob said . " Hey , you know what 's so brilliant about Cormac ? " <p> " No . " <p> " It 's that inside that whack world of crazy nouns and adjectives and explosions of verbs , there are definite rules . No one knows what the rules are , of course , except Cormac , which is why he 's The Man with a typewriter . Herman Melville of the border land-locked . " <p> " Herman Melville we can beat at pool , " I said . <p> " I saw Herman Melville 's grave once , years ago , " Bob said . " In the Bronx , New York , not far from Yankee Stadium . I expected a shrine to rival Jim Morrison 's or Mark Twain 's . But it was a smallish leaning limestone marker , not extraordinary at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember how the words were weathered down so that the gravestone was nearly flat and coarse . And there were no flowers , no sir . No bottles of sherry , no anything left near it-it was like no one had visited him in months . Hey , you know who else was in that cemetery ? " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Bat Masterson . " <p> " The Bat Masterson ? " <p> " Yup , that one and only . Know who else ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Miles Davis . " <p> " I thought he died in a gunfight out West somewhere . Arizona or someplace . " <p> " Miles Davis ? " <p> " No , Bat Masterson . " <p> " Naw . He went back to New York and became a sportswriter . " <p> Where are the Bobs of the world , making pilgrimages to pay respect to the father of Moby-Dick ? So maybe this pilgrimage to beat a still-living genius was n't that bad an idea-maybe it was a procession of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Battalions of English professors are working ' round the clock on cracking Cormac right now , " Bob says . " Think of the resources employed in the cause . Harness that energy , and you could light all the neon in every bar in Laramie . " <p> This trip would be good for me , I figured . Maybe I 'd find my head and bearings in El Paso . Maybe I 'd be motivated to finish commercial driving school or commercial carpentry school and make a better situation for Jeannie , my wife , and Hogue , my three-year-old son . Maybe they 'd take me back . But the licking of a novelist at billiards was n't something I needed-who but Bob and his blogger pals would it impress ? The act seemed akin to saying you beat Mark Arn , the local weatherman on Channel 5 out of Cheyenne , or even the Governor of Wyoming , what's-his-name ? - who would care ? But then , because it 's in the darkest pockets of our already-black souls , what we did not want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ham-fisted one like Cormac McCarthy . <p> So we practiced . Upstairs at the Buckhorn Bar down by the Union Pacific switchyard in old Laramie . The Buckhorn is the closest you can get in Wyoming to the image in our minds of El Paso , Texas ; the rest of Laramie , Wyoming , in general , are the Horse Latitudes of Culture . But in the Buck there are bullet dents in the pay phone-not holes , but dents , where a .38 Special 's slugs tried and failed to pierce the old and reliable communication device . No one still here knows the story of whether or not someone was on the phone and between lead and miracle material at the time of the denting . " Why do n't they just build cars and airplanes out of that stuff they make those pay phones out of ? " Bob says . <p> " Bob , man , " I said while working on a kick shot . Bob caught the balls so they would n't drop and cost us another fifty cents just to practice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Whatdoyamean ? " <p> " I mean , this guy Cormac does n't sound like he 's trying to outreach to readers , exactly . He does n't read down at the local coffee-house . He does n't do The Today Show . He does n't even tour after he writes a new book . No interviews . No lectures . He 's like the Dick Cheney of novelists . Maybe we can work up a game of eightball , but I just do n't want you to be surprised if we do n't leave El Paso F-O-C . " <p> " What the hell is F-O-C ? " <p> " Friends of Cormac . " <p> " No , no , hell no . What did you think ? We 're like gunslingers in the Old West . Those cats did n't have friends . Did n't need ' em . What 's a gunslinger with a friend ? A corpse , that 's what . They just wanted to rule a territory . And the baddest , the baddest of the bad would at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead in the other gunslinger 's face . Then they 'd go back home . That 's what we 're gon na do . " <p> You might want to know this about Bob . I first met him at the bowling alley one morning after I 'd let the Bluebird-load of middle school kids off , before I had any scheduled deliveries for Flower Rangers . He had been an attorney in Michigan , had had drive , ambition once , but said he found himself standing in front of Lane 4 one afternoon and thinking , What am I doing ? I do n't just not enjoy going to work-I outright hate it . Being a lawyer is unlike any lawyer 's life I 'd ever read about-Atticus Finch , my ass . I ca n't leave it , I bring the ambulance home with me evenings , and ca n't sleep because I 'm thinking about plaintiffs in neck braces and jowly paid expert witnesses . I 'd like to just bowl . <p> " The last straw , " he says , " was when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway was a copy of the new phone book , white and yellow pages . And there I was on a peel-and-keep baseball card begging anyone with a phone and a finger to call toll-free for a free accident consultation . " Bob blows a crown of Kool smoke and watches it drift over his monologue . " When I first moved to Laramie , I was looking for a place to hang out mornings . I wandered into the Buckhorn , and bowling turned into billiards . You know , bowling balls are so heavy in those early hours . Anyway , Cormac does n't bowl . I do n't know any novelists who bowl . Good novelists , anyway . " <p> After a couple of beers that morning , that first time we ever hung out and over together , he told me this : " I want to be a reader . Know what I mean ? " <p> " You mean a writer ? " I said . <p> " No , I want to be a reader . Go full-time with it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I like it more . The world does n't need another grocery list from me . " <p> " Is there a future in that ? " <p> Bob just shrugged his shoulders , like that question had never really occurred to him . <p> Bob is married to an incredible woman named Allison . Allison is a nurse . She works Intensive Care , and they live in West Laramie , the not-so-quaint part of town . It 's on the windward side of the city and takes the brunt of the Wyoming Wind Corridor , which is essentially the jet stream touching dirt , so that by the time the wind hits East Laramie , it 's worn out , tired , needs a break , needs to catch its breath before revving up over the mountain and down again onto Cheyenne . His trailer-park neighbor to the north is a methamphetamine chemist . His neighbor to the south is a hard-drinking mechanic named Chester who works nights out at the Petro truck stop . Allison is a certified nurse and punches graveyards at the hospital . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just getting to fill the refrigerator with the twelve-dollar arrangements when she 's going on shift , and her aura is that of an optimist , a smiler in scrubs the color of wine who believes even though in her heart she knows her husband has been bitten-by an affliction worse than alcohol or meth or golf-and she 's the one wearing the scrubs in the family for the foreseeable future that could so easily stretch into forever and death did we part . <p> She gets Bob free antibiotics with which he kills a sinus infection about twice a year . " That 's all the sick I ever get . Zythromax is the bomb , " he says . " But you got ta make sure you eat yogurt with it because it 'll kill even the good bugs in your gut . " Allison works so hard . Bob is still asleep when she gets home after the sun has only been up a few hours . And she showers the hospital off and crawls into bed next to him . Then he gets up and eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back off to work , Bob is at the library or second Story Books or practicing at the Buck with me . She 's incredible , and I love to watch her working so hard for people who need her , her black hair tied up and her skin sweating in those scrubs , making calculations about IVs and injections , and I think she is beautiful . So improbably beautiful when you consider Bob 's latest prospects . I 'm not sure what she sees in him anymore except that Bob used to be an attorney , still is , I guess , technically , if he 's kept his card up . And he can play " Old Plank Road " on the banjo . " What did the banjo picker say to the dentist ? " Bob says . <p> " I do n't know . What ? " <p> " This might hurt a little . " <p> I gave Bob a little piece of Spanish news . I 'm not sure what that means , but it sounds good in Tennessee Williams . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a redneck who likes books . " Swallow . " You 're an . An . An ... inkneck . " <p> Bob regarded me for a moment . He made wax lips with his . His marbles conflated and brightened . He seemed proud of that , that moniker : Inkneck . " Yeah . Right on , then . I 'm down with that . Makes me sound like a modern-day Queequeg-the tattooed harpooner of bookmobiles . " He sipped more beer . " So if I 'm an ink-neck , what 're you-a redneck who delivers children and flowers ? The dandelion cowboy ? " <p> " Just that , I guess . " I had n't really thought of a definition of the picture of myself in a long time-I 'd been putting it off . There I am , interfacing with all those people taking blood pressures , setting bones , saving lives . Here I am , a taxi driver for small plants . Travis Bickel with baby 's breath . <p> There 's still so much stuff out there Bob has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask him sometime to show you the tattoo on his deltoid of the knife stuck into the book and the book is bleeding and the blood has pooled so that you can not read the title . " I was going to have the title on the book read Allison , " he 'll tell you . " But when I got it done down at Tiny 's Tattoo Rodeo , you know , the place at Ivinson and Owen Wister , Tiny asked me how do I spell her name , and I was so messy that I could n't remember if my Allison was spelled with one l or two . Then Tiny says , Is it with an i or a y ? Tiny did n't know either , so all I can do is sit there in the barber chair and stare at Tiny like he 's a man on Mars trying to remember one l or two and do I gamble on it until Tiny looks at me like I 'm so lost he does n't even feel right about inking me at all anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we could have called her and asked her at that ungodly hour-she was working . " <p> It 's dark in the back room of the Buck , like a casino , and you lose the sensation of time-a guy could spend a lifetime in there , and it would only feel like a stage he was going through . The Buck smells of a combination of cigarette smoke , old books , and cat urine . Bob has this habit of powdering his hands with talc about every third shot , caressing the phallic cone like it 's a work of art and he the master potter . Talc fills the air when he claps ritualistically . I 'd watched Bob slipping since he 'd dreamt this Cormac plan , and now he saw the entire world through bad-metaphor-tinted glasses . " It 's like being in an asbestos mine , " he said . " We 're like bats in here , bats playing pool and drinking bat beer in an asbestos mine . " <p> " Bob , " I said over the pool table , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think it 's possible to read a life away ? " <p> Whatdoyamean ? <p> " To never live , just exist vicariously through characters from someone else 's imagination . Someone else 's heart . And all the while your body is dying , atrophying , sagging and burping and decaying and gassing and cells are shitting the bed and begging for a few antioxidants in order to go buck the molecular inevitable one last futile time ? " <p> Bob took a long pull of beer . " Yes I do , " he said while banking the nine-ball into the northeast corner pocket , a nice pinch of backspin on the whitey . <p> " Nice shot , " I said . Bob speaks in semicolons , so I just waited for him to reply to my question . The question scared me , made me think of my own life , and how working driving a bus for the school district and delivering flowers are great jobs with flexibility if you like to drive around town and listen to kids screaming and the world revolving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever I feel like it , but maybe there 's no future in that , either , when the bottom line is both jobs put together with overtime do n't pay fertilized squat . Bob dropped another one , and he was after the black eight . He stroked it a little too hard , and it jawed between the corner tits and hung in the pocket for me to take on home . <p> " You on the lemonade ? " I said . " It 's not like you to miss that one . " <p> " The sun was in my eyes . " <p> " Care to expound ? " <p> " On what ? " <p> " On the point that you agree that it 's possible to read a life away in some sort of bibliophilie Margaritaville . " <p> " Well , " he said , stealing a tall quaff from the shell glass that paints the mustache of his goatee white with foam . " That could happen to a cat like me . So that 's why we 're shooting now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to El Paso and box Cormac 's ears . " <p> Chester looked Bob 's old 1972 Volvo bucket over and said it probably would n't make it to Tie Siding , let alone El Paso , but that we could always pull the license plates and thumb it or catch the Greyhound back to East Laramie if the car goes south . " It 's those damn Swedes , " Chester said . " They rolled out that insane Bosch fuel injection years before it was ready , thinking they were getting the jump on the carbureted world . It was like taking a box of empty guns to a knife fight . " <p> " Thanks , Chester , " Bob said . " For ten bucks will you tell us what we want to hear ? " <p> " Hell , I 'll tell you what you want to hear for five . But if I were you I 'd take your sister 's flower van there . Just top off the tank when you get back , and no one will notice . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He smiled his big goateed Mephistophelean beat smile . " But there 's a way in Hell-Paso ! " <p> And that 's really the beginning of-if you were drawing this out on a napkin-the parabolic are leading from the bad idea , over the hump of consequences , and down into damn dubious resolution . <p> We hit the tripmeter on the van at the cement plant at the south edge of Laramie . Leaving Laramie is a little anxiety-inducing-to go off the standards of semesters and happy hours and hunting holiday and **37;1702;TOOLONG down at the Pony Expresse . From this windy Lotusland we are sucked through the sewer pipe that is ! - 25 , down the diabolic vortex of the Front Range . Traffic in Denver is-no **25;1741;TOOLONG . No one in Denver is happy . In fact they 're pissed off most all of the time . Round the clock , like it 's their job and they work hard at it . That 's because no one there is from Denver , they all bought into the John Denver Theory of the Universe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and U-Hauled away from all their family and points of reference to the Mile High City instead . When they got there so much of their stuff was broken , and they quickly learned the city is polluted as any on whichever dream coast they 'd come from , skiing was still two hours away on a good day , and the one thing they brought with them that they should have left back where they 'd come from was themselves . Besides , their baseball team , the Rockies , is a perennial turd . That , Bob and I say , is why they drive this way . <p> I 'd never used the air conditioning in the van before-never needed it in Laramie . Also I knew it did n't work . Down about Fort Collins Bob turned it on , and it kicked out a bug-gun plunge of dust , then some hot air , then less-hot air , then air just as hot as the air outside . " Ha , " Bob said . " This is travelin ' ice wagon style . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border , from some Freon smugglers . " He liked the word , Freon-it sounded dangerous and illegal . " We ought a stock up on Freon for this baby . " He was sipping on another beer from the block-ice flower cooler in the back . " This reminds me of my friend Puker 's hearse he drove in high school . Had a ski rack on the top and a pressurized keg system in the back . We took it skiing . " <p> " I did n't know you skied . " <p> " I just went the once with Puker . I do n't like being outside in the cold all day . I guess it was n't all day , just an hour or most of it . It was really icy so I kicked it by the fireplace in the lodge with a book . " <p> " You remember what book ? " <p> " Yeah , it was The Red Badge of Courage . I love that one . I sat there and read it twice , I think . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheyenne and rushed them over the pass to Laramie , Wyoming got the dead and dying flowers they swapped out of hospital coolers all over the country-that 's where they all went , along with watery avocados and black apples and chocolate-colored bananas : Wyoming . <p> This is n't true , of course , except for the fruit , but it makes for an anecdote to tell patients and orderlies and nurses and custodians as I 'm swapping out the cooler . Now sometimes there are flowers left over-an order is mixed up or messed up or I 'm refreshing the hospital cooler with tulips and roses just off the airplane , so I get to keep the old stock-when you 're already there there 's no Wyoming for us to send them to . That 's my favorite part of the job-I 'm the Shepard of Sunshine then . Jesus of the Geraniums . I 'm free to dispense the irregulars ! I often take a bunch to Jeannie , though she knows I get them free when the flowers are tired and their end is near , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have time to kill , and I take them by , anyway , our place-her place now-on Custer Street . I 'll try to be clumsy and leave the window down with the AM blaring Gordon Lightfoot or Jim Croce or someone , and maybe Jeannie will come out and catch me leaving flowers on the doorstep , and maybe Hogue will be on her leg , wondering who it is and are they brandishing possibilities . <p> Sometimes I 'll give those flowers to someone in a wheelchair and a smock who could use a boost . And if I still have a vase or two left , I take one into Rosie , the afternoon barmaid at the Buck . Rosie has been the afternoon barmaid since before they built the railroad . I have a pop-just one-before I have to get bus number six and deliver kids . When I get back to the Buck in two or three hours , those roses are on the bar , standing up to all that smoke , doing their best for as long as they can . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase water , " I tell Rosie . " None of that damn Sweet'N Low . " <p> And once I left some roses in baby 's breath at the Intensive Care desk with a note : " For Allison , from someone who cares and appreciates all that you do . " I hope she thought they were from Bob ; I hope he did n't screw it up when she got home . <p> At Raton Pass the sign says all commercial vehicles must stop at the inspection station . I pull in and shut down on the scale in front of the flat-roofed inspection building . The Inspection agents inside do n't even get out of their chairs-they wave me off , and they 're laughing , very animated through the glass , maybe at a joke one of them told . <p> Wyoming is not a food state . South of Raton , New Mexico , we stop to eat at Heck 's Hungry Traveler in the middle of a tumble-weed field . Heck 's Hungry Traveler is nothing to read at home about , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soggy fries . I am sad to report that in Wyoming , Heck 's would be tops . Then Las Vegas and Elephant Butte . " It really does look like an elephant , " Bob says . <p> " All ridgelines look like elephants if you stare at them long enough , " I say . " Elephants and Sleeping Indians . " Truth or Consequences . <p> " I think that 's a portent , " Bob said . " A sign . You know , we 're seeking the truth about Cormac . The consequences of not seeking the truth would have been that you 'd have to hear me speculate about the Cormac truth , the shattering of the myths , until hell freezes over . " <p> I wanted to throw a switch on the metaphilosophy . " Man , think of the badass hanging judge this place was named after back in the day . Gavel-pound-wham-give me truth or be damned to the consequences ! " <p> " Actually , " Bob said with his especially informative tone . " The place is named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truth or Consequences . Sad but nonfiction-I read about it . " <p> " Anyway , " I said , " the place looks just like West Laramie . " <p> " You think ? " said Bob . <p> The strip buffets and furniture marts and pancake houses are stacked like teeth along I-25 through Las Cruces , where the crusty ass-end of the Rocky Mountains is pounded flat before ramping up again in Mexico 's Sierra Madres . South of Las Cruces , pecan orchards turn into dairy farms that turn into creosote fields . At the border we pass a horseracing track , then Exit o , and Bob takes it as a sign . " Exit of There ca n't be an Exit o-we 've entered a new dimension . " There is a line in the road , and the pavement goes from New Mexico decent to Texas sketchy . " We 've reached Cormac 's Van Diemen 's land , " Bob said . Past a glowing steel mill . " There 's the blacksmith in the village of the damned . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croker sacks full of bats and children-croker sack being one of those Cormac words Bob especially enjoys . <p> The sky over El Paso was capped with a pollution cloud the color of the plastic-jug tequila that goes by the name of Potter 's . Bob had read on several of those Cormac-worshipping websites that caution you not to ring the writer 's doorbell that Cormac really does not live underneath an oil derrick , not in a rough stone hovel without running water , but rather he lives in engineered seclusion in a regular neighborhood in El Paso , and in the afternoons he grabs his stick and runs the tables on the locals . " Coffin Avenue , " Bob said . " I have it on good authority that Cormac lives on Coffin Avenue . I want to respect the man 's privacy and just beat him at pool , not interrupt his next divine epistle . " We 'd start at one pool hall , talk to the lokes , get a lead , and go from there . Bob seemed to think , once we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to us , the cosmic practicality of it synchronizing smooth as a new transmission . <p> Unless we won some money right away , enough to afford a motel room for a night or two , we planned to sleep in the flower van and use it as our war room . We donned cowboy shirts that we 'd bought at Corral West Ranchwear , the discount chain store , on the way out of Laramie . Mine was a simple-yoked job in a modest cinnamon-toast plaid and round faux-pearl snap buttons . Bob 's a solid burnt coffee with double-diamond onyx snaps and pollen-yellow arrow slit pockets . " This is a shirt Suttree would wear , " Bob said . It did go nicely with his sneakers , vintage black canvas basketball models . " Harrogate maybe , " I offered , trying to keep the pre-game light . <p> " Naw , definitely Suttree . " I 'd learned this on the nature programs on the Nature Channel : there 's a certain moth in Mexico or someplace that , in times of danger , stands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself appear to be two , three times larger than it really is . We wore our shirts untucked to give us some casual authenticity while at the same time making us look bigger and forces not to tangle with . <p> " We 'll need our strength , " Bob said . " Come on , let 's fortify ourselves with tacos . " <p> One thing I noticed right off was that there are more houseflies in El Paso than in Laramie . But they 're slower , probably from the heat . It takes a lot more energy for an airplane to take off in the thin , hot air , so these jumbo-jet houseflies have to work hyperdrive just to make it to the menudo drippings on the counter , let alone get out of the path of the whiffled head of a fly swatter traveling one hundred twenty miles an hour . But since no one else in the place seemed to notice them , those fly swatter swings were nonexistent at best . <p> The salsa . Ha , I 've had salsa . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bob . Kinda the color of Pepto-Bismol . The salsa came in a Negra Modelo beer bottle-probably because they 're dark glass , and they do n't have to wash them very often-and you had to pour it onto a chip yourself : I drowned a greasy , stale chip with this stuff the viscosity of vomit , popped it in my mouth . My face began to melt off like red paint stripped from an antique rocking chair . <p> I had to stand up . The little room spun and bucked . I had to step outside . I could n't feel my scalp and my ears rang and El Paso spun like a nightmare carnival ride . Booths and the countertops and the lights over Mexico went Salvador DaIi , and I strode Hell 's midway , and barkers and midgets and savages and little girls and patchy dancing bears were laughing at me and the atomic puss that was pouring from my orifices . I thought I was gon na pass out , and I think I sat down on a curb , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do remember thinking that if I did pass out , the world would be quiet and I could be at peace . For sure a taxi running over me could n't have hurt any worse . This is the chemical they make bear spray out of , I remembered . And I ingested it . On purpose . <p> I felt my face with my hands , then hunted just south of my eyes for my nose . My ears were still ringing , and I could n't taste the inside of my mouth . Bob was there poking a glass of manila-colored milk in my face and saying at first he thought it was funny , but not if he had to drive the Flower Ranger van all the way back to Laramie with me on ice and tell people I 'd been picanted to death in Old El Paso . <p> Bob checked the Yellow Pages , and we found a pool hall called Click 's in the sprawl not far from the university . There were college students and a platoon of Army boys from Fort Bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We played well , got loosened up , enjoyed the camaraderie , but how good can college students and soldiers be when they 've got to go to school or work or both part of a day , so all we did was go around the world a couple of times and made beer money and enough change for the jukebox so that I could play " Pinball Wizard " and " Folsom Prison Blues " and that trucking song about Tucumcari and weed , whites and wine , but not much else . Then the soldiers we 'd been shooting with went back to the base , and Bob and I drove downtown looking for Cormac like he was the Wizard of Fucking Oz . Which he sorta is . <p> We 'd asked around about him at Click 's , no one had heard of him . Or they were protecting him from groupies and the literary paparazzi . Perhaps he wore a funny hat and shot under an alias ? That 's okay , Bob said , he 'd recognize him . " He wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Maybe that 's just it , " I said . " Maybe he does wear camo , to blend in with all this camouflage . Sergeant McCarthy . " <p> " I doubt it , " Bob said . <p> We parked off of San Antonio and walked , our cue cases like violin cases from The Godfather , to a little row of shotgun bars just off of a street called Stanton . From here you can see the border to Mexico , all lit up with security lights , like a prison or a baseball field during a night game . <p> The windows of the bars were either plywooded over or smoked opaque from the inside , where it was dark and smoldering and part of you was afraid , but they had tequila and beer and a jukebox with Johnny Cash to buck you up and help you remember that The Man in Black had been there , survived , come out the other side , and so you could , too . Unless of course those songs were all just fiction , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which , I suppose , was possible , and all those formative years I 'd just taken the word in his songs for gospel . <p> We stepped into the Bar with No Name . I could feel the pressure equalize in my chest as the door swung closed behind me . " This place is the cat 's ass , " Bob said . " I told ya it would be , did n't I. " The warm green felt of the pool table drew at us like a lodestone . <p> There were drains in the floor under the row of barstools . The bartender was dozy drunk . Sometimes this works , like with Rosie , so that she overfills your drink and maybe does n't bother to charge you , but sometimes-like this cat-you pay , he underfills your drink , then demands for you to pay again . <p> " That 's just wrong , " Bob said , stepping away and sipping a sad little drip of tequila . " I did n't even get a lime . " <p> " Yeah . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he would n't go to loggerheads over our cocktails , but I enjoyed the image in my mind of this guy using Bob to wipe down the bar . <p> " Let 's finish our half doubles and chill , " Bob said . " Need to stay sharp , anyway . We 're here to shoot pool . Think about the game . " <p> A thick guy in a black leather vest and no shirt underneath broke a loose rack , not scattering the table very wide . We casually-as-we-could opened our cases and slowly assembled our sticks . When the guy shot , a necklace with what looked like a semicolon but was probably a claw or a fang dangled nearly to the baize . Silver studs on the back of his vest spelled H-E-C-T-O-R . <p> " So , when does Cormac like to shoot ? " Bob asked the man in the vest . <p> " Who ? " The guy had a tattoo of a green clown on the fat part of his arm . The clown had sharp fingernails and appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from liquid testosterone inside of the man and into the earthly hot and arid consciousness of El Paso . <p> " You know . Cormac . Cormac McCarthy . All the Pretty Horses . He shoots some eight-ball most evenings when he gets done with writing and his nap and whatnot . " <p> Nap ? Where the hell did nap come from ? <p> Hector signaled to a couple of buddies that they 'd better get over here . " All the Pretty Horses ? " <p> " Yeah , that Cormac . The man . " <p> " The man , huh . Where you from , Pretty Horses ? " <p> " Wyoming . " <p> " We got sports all the way from Wyoming . Chalk your cues , boys . Cormac 'll probably be here in a little while . " <p> " Good deal , " Bob said . But this was n't like shooting pool in the Buckhorn . The tables were tilted or the baize was nappy or the balls were more dense or the lack of altitude or humidity or barometric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cats took a good chunk of what dollars we had to get to Cormac with . " All part of my plan , " Bob said . " It takes money to make money . A date with Cormac ai n't gon na be cheap . " <p> Bob was on a roll with the clichs when a shadow walked in the front door . <p> " What would those chances be ? " <p> " Well , we 've narrowed our scope down to pool tables in El Paso . So maybe it is him . " <p> My heart tried to climb out of my chest , just like it had when I 'd eaten that salsa . <p> " Nope , false alarm . That ai n't him . " <p> " How would you know ? You got a poster of him like Steve McQueen in your bedroom ? <p> " No , just his author photo . The newest one-the one where he 's a hawkish , wise , weathered plug of brilliance . That guy looks like he 's had a tough week at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges of the sickening feeling of having actualized this ridiculous sortie . This really is n't happening to me . I 'm smarter than this . The feeling in my stomach was like the time I ate leftover sushi in Casper . <p> " Cormac looks , " Bob said , " like a guy who 's been carrying a typewriter around on his shoulders all day . A huge smoking , ringing , coal-fired , trip-hammer , stamp-mill typewriter , forged from the same stuff they make pay phones out of . " Bob was getting even more abstract and postmodern as we kept racking and playing Hector and his buddies for beer money and mostly losing it . Neither of us was on our game . At least not yet . " Maybe , just to say no hard feelings for us taking his lunch money at the tables , he 'll invite us to sleep over in his guest room . And a beautiful girl , a senorita , will bring us breakfast on a tray . " <p> I 'd known guys addicted to fantasy fiction-you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trekkies . Neo-noir crime freaks . But with only a couple unfortunate exceptions I knew they could always function in the world and not hurt themselves . But not literature . Literary fiction was supposed to be good for you , vitamins for your mind-no more harmful than an accidental overdose of Flintstones chewables . <p> This writer was still dangerous , still alive , and not all bloated and worn out like Norman Mailer or some other lesser Manhattan fictionist-Cormac was still living on Coffin Avenue in El Paso and shooting pool at gunslinger level . It had become clear as the Lone Star sign that Bob was more than a fanatic , a lunatic aficionado : Bob had been set afoot in Cormac 's world , protected by the white space in the margins of a book as if they were velvet bumpers . Bullets now for Bob were no more lethal than periods . Switchblades no more deadly than exclamation points . Bob had become so necessary to the plot of this story that the writer could not afford to kill him off , at least this soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pisser , Bob had become vital . It was now clear to me that Cormac-the myth of Cormac-controlled our reality-our present and our immediate future . And Bob 's fantasies and delusions could get us both killed . <p> I knew I 'd left my reality and entered the Cormac Meridian for certain when in walk these two girls , women maybe , with a dwarf . Midget ? I guess " little person " would be the PC term . The little guy was wearing a bull rider 's hat , a big black Resistol with an ostrich feather in the band . His face only a dark shadow , and he wore a leather vest less like Hector 's and more like one you might see on a child . The women were intimidatingly beautiful , athletic in their carriage , with cheekbones and skin the hue of a new latte after it jounces around and the espresso shots mate with the skim milk . Straight black hair like a horse 's , hair so shiny you could see your future in it . The little bull rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick gray book to where he wanted to shoot . He stood on the book and sighted the cue between his thick little thumb and pointy finger . And he used a man 's cue , just like he wore a man 's hat because his head was still regular-not a youth stick like you might expect him to . <p> " This is Jarvis , " one of the women said . She wore a choker of bone around her neck and black motorcycle chaps that framed her butt in a perfect apple . Tattooed razor wire the color of copper oxidation on the Statue of Liberty banded the muscle part of her arm . The green baize of the pool table was an oasis , a golf course in the desert . The light hung myopically low , the fret diamonds on the wood gunwales . They may have been sisters , but who can tell in the lucubrating glow of a smoking pool table light . " Jarvis is the star bull rider in the dwarf rodeo over to Juarez . " <p> " That so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school basketball scores . " Did n't know there was such an event . I see that book you stand on is a reissue of Middlemarch . " Then , while the dwarf looked down , " You like to wager a little added money , Jarvis ? " <p> The little clich nodded , hopped up on his book , then dropped two on the break , a big one and a little one . He read the break , set up for solids , and sunk three in a row , click-thunk , click-thunk , click-thunk , kicking Middlemarch around the gritty floor with the heel of his little boot . <p> " That must make you run in large circles in the greater Juarez/El Paso metropolitan area , riding bulls in the rodeo and all . " Bob shot and missed . " You know a friend of mine in El Paso , by chance , guy named Cormac ? " <p> " Cormac . " Jarvis ' voice was a little tinnier than Bob 's . " Darkhaired fella . Kinda intense . He shoots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days , but then I 've been working on the dark side . " <p> The other sister wore an amulet with something-something liquid-the color of blood through antique medicine glass . She 'd disappeared and came back with a pitcher of drinks the color of green Kool-Aid . It tasted strongly alcoholic and medicinal , like nighttime cold medicine . <p> We beat Jarvis , then the girls , one-on-one and in teams . They won one , then we beat them again . We kept drinking the green liquor , and they apparently had lime Gatorade on the rocks like real athletes because the table for me got fuzzy , but they seemed to laugh and chalk and shoot sharp as new Bic shavers . It was n't long before we were poisoned as mescal worms , and they beat us without interruption . <p> While they were beating us , instead of thinking about the game , this is what I 'm watching instead : These women play with the grace of a cat in the crown of yonder tall cottonwood tree . Witches . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dancers ' finesse and librarians ' flexibility . And Jarvis , remember him , the little sable bull rider and that damn thick British novel of his-together , novel under dwarf , they are better than the best pool player in all of Wheatland . The atmosphere filled with the precise percussion of Belgian balls ticking together like an antique clock as if this were a measurable thing , a sport of time . <p> Another thing about billiards . It 's not like cards-pool is nearly impossible to cheat at ; it 's put up or shut up . Bob and I could n't touch them with a bridge , could n't run three balls together , and they were flashing lipstick rodeo teeth and laughing in Spanish , table-dancing apparition-like on the rails when Bob asked when Cormac usually shows up on a Saturday night , and the next thing that happens is that Hector-whom I 'd forgotten all about-steps from the binding shadow and starts talking to Jarvis . Hector said something about how Bob and I are two dimes down , and it 's a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some beauty rest before the sun comes up . <p> It was n't the money . Well , of course it was the money , but they 'd not only beaten us thoroughly , they 'd made us like it-we owed them two grand , not counting drinks . But more than losing this kind of cash , it 's what would happen when they saw we did n't have anything but more air-barrels in our pockets . <p> I needed to get Bob out of here ; I needed to get me out of here . He needed to get back to Allison and maybe into some sort of program for fiction addiction . But first we had to get away from this table and Jarvis and the pretty girls and Hector and all of Hector 's crows sitting , pacing in the shadows like auxiliary characters trying out for a manuscript . <p> Hector spoke : " Friends , I 've got a solution to our situation . " I did n't trust his gray smile . " I know where there 's an ATM . Let 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the Third World-our ATM will read your Wyoming ATM card . As if it were magic . " <p> " Okay . Sure , " Bob said . <p> " Would n't hurt to have a little cash for later , too , " I said . " Buy some more of this tasty green stuff . " <p> " Good thinking , " Bob said . " For when Cormac shows up . " <p> " Ha ! " It was Jarvis . He pointed his little buffalo fart finger at Bob and barked at him : " Cormac moved to Santa Fe , New Mex-i-co , a month ago ! " <p> The handle of a pool cue swinging through the air has the same physics , just a little less mass , as a baseball bat . I needed to hit Hector square and not foul off his head or he 'd turn around and crush me and again . I rose above myself like cigarette smoke , looked down , and could see myself swinging the cue in Kyros time . So strange , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the act , and it was n't me but a paper protagonist committing this manic swinging of dangerous sporting goods in order to save something for a scripted dnouement . Up there , from where I watched myself do this visceral thing , I could see Bob and Jarvis and the horse-angel sisters . In the bruise of shadows are all the black crows , sound of nervous feathers when they hear the cue handle hit square . Hector 's head did not explode like a melon . I watched Hector fall in slow motion , like the statue of Saddam Hussein , falling headlong , then crashing against the table , then the tile floor . I could see me yell something incomprehensible , drop the cue like a baseball bat after a single , then follow Bob to the exit . <p> We stepped through the atomic cheese-wedge of neon and floodlight that cursors the door . The two of us made it past the crows , who must have been stunned that someone would do this to their Hector . Outside it was still Baghdad-hot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarmac . <p> We ran . " Not the van , " I yelled . " They 'll be waiting for us at the van . " <p> " Right . " Bob sounded like he was hyperventilating . We kept running on heavy legs , past the square gray correctional facility , past Amigo 's Bail Bonds , we ran on adrenaline and lost time because , as you 'll read in Einstein , time is relative to what it is you are doing . We ran some more . Asphalt turned to soft earth as we pulled up in the middle of a dark lot , a place to build , a hospital perhaps , a library . It felt safe there , in a relative sense . We stopped to blow , hands on our knees , trying to heave as quietly as possible . " I need to sit down for a minute , " Bob said . I did , too . We were tired in that way that if you knew you 'd never wake up it would n't matter-all that matters in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the sheets are clean . <p> I awoke to the sticky tickle of flies big as black olives walking around the snoring rimrock my lips made . I could hear the Sturm und Drang of diesel machines . Something the size and shape of a silver dollar had stuck then dried to my cheek . I turned my head and saw magnanimous brown , antennaed roaches fighting over a splintered bone with scabs of meat still hanging on it at a knuckled joint . There were more pieces of bone , and I 'd fallen asleep on some of them . My cowboy shirt was torn and stained in an inedible color I did n't recognize . My wrists and forearms were tacky with dried blood . The morning became literal . " My God , I 've been savaged ! " I yelled . <p> Bob had propped himself up by the elbow in order to survey his morning glorious because it was not in an office , not on a street , not part of the mainframe of progress . If he 'd had a stem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of On the Road . Bob relished this bookish lifestyle . " Take it easy , " he said . " I think it 's chili sauce . Too dark for ketchup . And you 've got a pickle stuck on your cheek . " <p> The bones were chicken bones . " Church 's , " Bob said confidently . " I can tell by the color of the batter . " <p> " Well , why do n't you just have a little for breakfast , " I said . " I 'm sure we can find a scoop of coleslaw and half a biscuit to go with it . " <p> We must have been in the City of El Paso 's landfill . One of them , anyway . How had we managed to find the one-hundred-yard section of cyclone fence that had been torn out , probably for expansion ? The rest of the landfill was railed with cyclone fence and concertina wire . I guess they did n't want anyone coming to the Land of Opportunity through the landfill . " Is n't this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob 's intrepid enthusiasm . " Cormac may not still be here , but think of all his leavings . Cormac detritus . Old combs , paper plates , magazines with his address , empty tins of kippered snacks , junk mail with his name on it-an alias maybe-bourbon bottles from his Drinking Period , old notes and manuscripts , an Olivetti typewriter ribbon , grocery lists-the possibilities are bottomless ! In a hundred years armies of archaeologists from English departments all over the world will be out here mining this place for POC . " <p> " POC ? " <p> " Proof of Cormac . " <p> I closed my eyes and could see the page-three headline in tomorrow 's El Paso Times on the backs of my eyelids : " Man Murdered at Landfill . " The traction atop the spongy overburden was not excellent , but the chicken bones gave me enough purchase to propel myself just high and far **52;1817;TOOLONG hit the little weed sucker right in the Adam 's apple . <p> " Ow ! " <p> " You need to snap out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . I 'm without my nonfiction flower van , and I owe nonfiction money to psychokillers and a rodeo dwarf . I may have killed a guy last night , trying to save the paper-thin skin on your ass . " Exhausted , I made a slow overfill angel on my back , staring at the sun with my eyes closed because it felt good on my head . I needed water . <p> " My God , what 's gotten into you ? " Bob rolled up on his butt and felt his throat . " You never used to be violent . It 's this place , is n't it . The borderland . I warned you , and now you 've injured my thrapple , for Godsakes . " <p> I rolled my head to look at him . Everything went still and silent . The wind stopped . Flies lit and became frozen . The diabolical diesel Cats shut off their engines , and the sun ducked behind a hot cloud . " What did you just say ? " <p> " I du n no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you injured something . What was it ? " <p> " My thrapple . You 've bruised my damn thrapple . " <p> I sat up . " What the hell 's a thrapple ? No , wait , before you tell me you 'll listen up and now , you little ex-attorney : this thrapple you 're talking about better not be what I think it is . " I was pointing at him like a middle school principal at the kid who just pulled the fire alarm . Bob regarded me , the Cormac term for the thing he was doing . <p> " All right , then it 's not , " he said . <p> " Not what ? " <p> " Not what you think it is . " <p> " What is it , then ? " <p> " Nothing . I feel better , crazy man . Leave me be . " <p> " Wrinkle not thy reptilian brow at me , my friend . " I was channeling now . " You 're gon na tell me . You 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " <p> " No I 'm not . " <p> " Do n't make me do something Holden on you . " <p> " Ha . Just put it on the shelf right next to all the other foolishness we 've gotten into in Hell Paso . " Bob grinned . " I ai n't telling . " <p> " It 's a Cormac word , is n't it . " <p> " It 's just a word . A word for the thing on my person that hurts right now . Thanks to you . " <p> " Yeah , and it 's a Cormac word . From that Godforsaken two-hundred-dollar dictionary he keeps on the six-thousand-dollar pool table in his hundred-thousand-dollar living room . In Santa Fe . " I tried to say " Santa Fe " like an invective . " Just admit that it 's a Cormac word . I ai n't happy about it , but admit it and we 'll forget the whole thing . " <p> " No . " <p> " It 's gon na mean the difference between epigraph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said it . " <p> " I will not . " <p> " You 're really starting to scare me . " <p> " You need some fear in your life . " <p> " If I admit it , will you shut up about it and we can go get some breakfast ? " <p> " We 'll see about that . " <p> " Pancakes . Eggs . No , I know : huevos rancheros . With pancakes . And a tortilla-a flour tortilla the size of a hubcap . Coffee . " <p> " Maybe . " <p> " Orange juice . " <p> " We 'll see . " <p> " Okay , it 's a Cormac word . " <p> I 'd meant to keep my own word about forgetting the whole thing , but I snapped again , my nerves sanded thin as they were . My fight-or-flight mechanism got crosswired and sideways with my benevolent self , and I grabbed a drumstick Henry VIII style and went for him . We ran around Commercial Construction , past Steel Salvage and Biodegradable Organics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be diapers and Kleenex and condoms and other unseemlies . Where did his energy come from in this hellishly hot hungover state ? <p> Bob ducked out of the landfill and was an earth-colored man about streets and statues and sidewalks . He remained one block ahead of me , vectoring around the city , careful to cross with signals . I could n't be sure , but my hunch was that he had bearings enough to find where the van had been when we last saw it . <p> The van was there . It appeared untouched except for a parking ticket pinned like a goose feather under the driver 's wiper blade . In no way did I anticipate this , such fortune , a happy ending . My anger had been exorcised on the run , and now I just felt volumes of hope because the van seemed real and whole . <p> " We could disappear in Chihuahua . " Bob was catching his breath , sitting on the bumper . " Go to Mexico and never come back . Just like Ambrose Bierce . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us on mules under sombreros the size of poker tables . There were buzzards and a three-legged dog . " Naw , " I told him . " Allison would n't like it . " <p> We had to pay for gas with Allison 's Texaco card . We bought snacks with it , too , because the clerk never bothered to look at the name on the card . If a clerk had looked and told Bob he did n't look like an Allison and some picture ID would need to be produced , Bob could say that we were on a crusade and had been licked and were heading home . He could say that Allison would approve of these corn chips and bloody Redbulls . That while she humps it at the hospital , helping people not to die , someone needed to be down here representing the readers , making sure writers did n't move to places like Bozeman or Jackson Hole or , most of all , Santa Fe . He did not get to say this to any filling station clerks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said was " Allison 's my wife . The only one I got . Maybe you could call her ? " <p> On the way home we did n't talk much for a long time . I 'd been thinking that when we got back to Laramie I 'd cook something , something for three , launder my World 's Greatest Dad shirt with the mustard stain Hogue gave me for Father 's Day when he was one , and take a picnic over to Jeannie 's , a casserole maybe , because Hogue likes tater tots and cream of mushroom soup . With a cold salad . I would n't tell her I went to El Paso with Bob in the flower van . What for ? She 'd ask and then I 'd be stuck having to tell her we were trying to hustle a novelist she 'd never heard of and never would care to read and then I 'd be back in that place in our relationship when kicking me out seemed like the smartest , most immediate thing in the world . <p> As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop flies I 'd decided I would chalk it up to experience and try to forget it . Near Socorro , where the earth starts to bunch up like a Sunday tablecloth before cresting and falling through so many hot Sulphur Springs and Sleeping Indians , Bob said something about how down here the sun rises and sets differently than in Wyoming , the way it blots and spreads and fades at the periphery like chili sauce on hot broken eggs . <p> North of Albuquerque there were billboards for Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor and then SANTA FE NEXT FOUR EXITS . We passed the first exit . " We could pull in , " I said . " Could n't be all that hard to find Cormac at a table in Santa Fe . Probably air-conditioned . " <p> There was a pause . Then : <p> " Naw , " Bob said . " It 's not the same . Santa Fe . A far , far cry from El Paso . Cormac might as well be Tony Hillerman . Anyway , he 's probably collecting postage stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seldom felt that kind of relief , but I had known something like it before-it was the feeling of getting a busload of middleschool kids back to town on icy roads in visibility-zero . <p> " A pool shark in Santa Fe is like a-like a pirate on a Carnival Cruise , " Bob said . There was a long funereal pause . " He deserves flaccid sales on his next book , just like he got with Cities on the Plain . And worse . I liked that scene with the rabbit heads in the radiator grill , but he deserves to be remaindered from hell to breakfast . " <p> Colorado . It had been quiet and peaceful between us , and I was thinking soft thoughts , how we could go back to spending our mornings at the Buck , shooting just for fun and quarters , when-north of Trinidad and not yet to Pueblo-Bob starts in , cooking up this plan to drive to deep-woods Arkansas and see if we can find Charles Portis , the mastermind behind True Grit , Dog of the South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs and birds and shotguns and whistles and bourbon . I told Bob to shut the hole under his nose and that 's the last I wanted to hear of it . <p> Author Affiliation
