WHEN I SAW HIM IN VIENNA , his eyes gave both Of us away . <p> Tiny nuggets of blue fire spread through the pale gray made Patrick Farrell 's eyes appear unnaturally alert , or wary . Even when he spoke to you directly , he had always looked preoccupied , creating the impression that what was really on his mind was predicting the trap laid by the enemy around the next corner . If he knew what was out to get him , he could steal its sting . In Vienna he must have had an idea of what was going to happen . If he did , knowing did n't help . The sting went deep . It was permanent . In Vienna , Patrick Farrell did n't get away . <p> " Jesus y Maria , " he said when he saw me on the bench in the Volksgarten , on the edge of the Ring , " if it is n't the ever-dapper Peter Carrington . " <p> People used to call me dapper because I was anything but . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or somehow raggedly stitched together , no matter what I wore . Neither the easy tag nor the appearance bothered me , much . I gave up worrying about the image after I gave up trying to change my style . <p> The contrast with Farrell was glaring . He had always looked like an Irish cowboy , and he was still fairly dashing even though he must have been forty-eight , maybe even fifty , by then . The thin strokes of gray in his long rust mustache drew more attention to the color than to its slow leaching out . The weight he had collected had distributed itself evenly , so that the slight thickening gave him an additional layer of physical credibility . Bodies , too , seem to need to establish their own authority . <p> He wore a navy peacoat , black jeans , and work boots . Somewhere in a pocket he would have bunched a black watch cap . Hands fisted in the pockets of the coat , he looked down and slantwise at me . <p> What his eyes gave away about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave away about me was a describable lack . <p> The last time I had seen that expression was in Nicaragua , during the winding down of hostilities between the Sandinistas and the Contras . There had been a Contra raid when none was expected and no purpose , military or political , was served by the assault . I was in the area where the attack took place , doing a field study of potable water sources for a development organization . Why Farrell was there I do n't know , except that for something like fifteen years he had been showing up around Latin America wherever he thought the battle of the moment was going to be pitched . <p> The Contra unit had ambushed a unit of EPS soldiers patrolling a path through the woods near the Honduran border . They fought like two gangs of well-armed teenagers tangling over turf . The Contras got the better of it , sneaking back across the border , dragging a couple of men with minor wounds . The EPS unit lost three people , and two more were wounded seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded men were taken to the village in which I had parked my Landcruiser . I had spent the day on foot , interviewing the small farmers who lived in the hills around the village , which sat narrowshouldered on the floor of a cleftlike valley . When I returned in the evening , I wanted to pay my respects to the EPS guys . Though I did n't blindly hate the Contra fighters the way many people did-I blamed Uncle Sam for duping and then manipulating them-I did side strongly with the Sandinistas . They had wanted to pull off a real revolution , and if they had n't had to work it in such proximity to the country often referred to as the Colossus of the North , they might have been able to get away with it . <p> It was Patrick Farrell who turned me away from the door of the clinic where the wounded EPS soldiers lay on Czech-made cots . Do n't ask me where or how he had acquired the authority to do anything at all , or even to be there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chain of command . But what stayed with me , then and later , was the expression in those blue-fire eyes . The sorrow in them was as genuine as it was histrionic . Comrades had fallen . The outrage , too , was real , but that was the easiest thing a person might feel at the time and therefore , to me at least , less interesting . There was also a smoky sort of triumph in his beleaguered expression : What had happened on the trail in the woods that morning was the ultimate proof of U.S. government perfidy in Central America , if proof had been lacking . <p> The other thing about Farrell 's eyes was the way they cut me off , turned me out , pushed me to the margin . They made it clear that my way of caring , my way of being there in Nicaragua , did not count . What I did was like who I was : not enough . <p> " What are you doing in Vienna ? " he wanted to know . <p> I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he tended to be . There are days and times-a few of each-when everything you perceive and feel comes wrapped in glass . I mean when you ca n't help but see , or you are allowed to see , the momentary singularity in things : in people , in a soot-blackened cathedral , an unquiet magpie , fallen leaves rotting in a tram track . And at the same time those things seem , in their singularity , like emblems . They fit a pattern , or confirm an intuition , or prompt you for a story you forgot you knew . It was like that in the Volksgarten . <p> Across a bank of winter-clipped rosebushes , we watched a woman in high-heeled black boots giving loving , peremptory commands to a white poodle wearing a green wool sweater . A tall feather signaled authority from the brim of the woman 's hat . A moment later , a thin woman wrapped in a red coat passed in front of us . She told the man she was strolling with , in too consciously articulated Castilian Spanish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it not ? " Her companion , who wore a camel's-hair coat , looked newly brushed ; he was a man born to be brushed . He agreed with the Spanish woman that it was a question of taste . <p> " For cryin ' out loud , " Farrell said . He had sat down next to me on the bench , on the edge of which he teetered , leaning forward as though fighting the urge to go after the Spanish woman . He wanted to tell her it was not a question of taste . It was a question , rather , of resource distribution , of haves and **25;1407;TOOLONG , of unfair advantage being continually taken by those who could and so they did . It was a question , he thought she should know , of people in parks and people in cages . <p> " I work for an outfit called People-2-People , " I told him . <p> " What the hell is that , some kind of sex-education deal ? " The name , his manner made plain , gave away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was just the kind of place a person like Peter Carrington would wind up in . <p> " We do exchange programs for adults , " I explained . " I 'm here to sign the contract to start a program with Austria . " <p> At the time I found it offensive that he would doubt what I told him . He licked his lips and squinted . He offered me a cigarette from a pack of Spanish black-tobacco Ducados . I was trying to quit , and mostly succeeding , but I accepted the smoke because I wanted him to stick around for a while . I 'm not sure why , except that I really did understand the emotional contortions he was going through , in a city as coolly ordered as Vienna , after our years in the cluttered chaos of poor countries in Latin America . <p> Farrell had started as a Peace Corps volunteer in Bolivia . His was the last group of volunteers to make two full years of service before a populist president threw the organization out . The Peace Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanguard action carried out in support of the Yankees ' plan to subjugate the continent . Farrell had never allowed himself to laugh when the story came up . He knew his fellow volunteers had not been sterilizing campesinas , but he assumed that the Bolivians ' basic instinct was accurate : There was a conspiracy to keep them down . <p> His two years on the Altiplano radicalized Farrell . He saw babies die in numbers . He saw men and women hunched in cold , cramped lives in a stupor of work and habit and lack that was the functional equivalent of slavery . Justice , he sneered , development , prosperity : As long as one man owns all the land in the valley , none of that is going to happen now , is it ? He was right , it was n't going to happen . And it did n't . I guess you can miss a person even if you do n't like him . <p> I spent a long time on the development circuit in Latin America . I worked for CARE , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Change . I had some technical skills that were useful . I knew how to survey land , and how to put together a budget and stick to it . I had good luck in hiring and training people . I was known to be an effective organizational guy with good cross-cultural manners . <p> I ran into Farrell at least once every couple years , since he traveled the same circuit . Most of the contracts he took were short-term , however , six months or a year . When we got together , he talked about where he was going next , and how the bad guys were conspiring to prevent anything truly useful from being done wherever he happened to be working at the time . He gripped my forearm with a strong hand and told me he needed a change , by which he meant he wanted , just once , a real revolution . <p> " Vienna is the last place I expected to see you , " I told him . <p> Once again a quick suspicious stare made me feel as though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just tying up a few loose ends . " <p> " How 's Veronica ? " <p> Veronica had left the Maryknolls first to live with and then to marry Farrell , after they worked together on a literacy campaign in rural Peru . <p> She was the perfect mate for the man , as politically committed as he was , and just as restless . She liked living in the pensiones and cheap hotels and two-room flats in poor neighborhoods toward which he gravitated . And though she had n't known it , she had been saving up a life 's worth of sexuality for him , a gift you 'd think any man would know enough to value . <p> " That did n't work out the way it was supposed to , " he said . <p> " Sorry . " I wanted to know why , but pushing would have sent him away , and I wanted him to stay and talk . <p> " You 're married , right ? " he accused me . " You look supremely married . " <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And your kids are happy . They 're high achievers , are n't they ? They hit way above the national average on all the standardized tests . Do they still make kids black in all those circles with a pencil ? " <p> " So staying married and having well-adjusted kids makes me some kind of sellout , is that it ? The only mortal sin left that a person can commit is accommodation ? " <p> " Cool your jets , Peter . " He offered me another Ducado . The taste , after abstinence , was better than you might think it could be . " Let 's back up a little , OK ? You figure I 'm a little stressed out or what ? " <p> " I do n't figure anything . " <p> " I 've got something on my mind , that 's all . Makes me grumpy when I think about it , and I ca n't quit thinking about it . Speaking of which , I might have to ask you to do me a small favor . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope . " <p> " No problem . I 'm flying back to the States in a couple days . I 'll take it with me . " <p> He shook his head , and I felt as though I had been gently corrected , set right in my innocence , which was of the touching variety . " That 's not what I mean . " <p> " Then what do you mean ? " <p> " Here in Vienna . " He leaned close , grabbed my arm the way he did when he wanted to suggest confidence . " Somebody will call you in your hotel . They 'll tell you where to drop off the envelope , and when . All you have to do is follow their instructions . That 's the main thing : Pay attention to the instructions they give you . Iowa tests , that 's what they used to call the damn things , You had to fill in a million circles with a black pencil , number two lead . The teachers made you think the scoring machine was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your pencil . They wanted you to stay inside the circle . " <p> The sensation that clenched in me was not premonition , it was compacted loss , something with long roots wrenched violently out . " I do n't think I can do that , " I said slowly . <p> He tossed the butt end of his Ducado on the sidewalk , ground it out with a boot heel . In the cold his hands were red , the knuckles white . He rolled his tongue around in his mouth . " I guess you 're right , " he agreed easily , the words coming as slowly as mine had come . " You do n't think you can do it . " <p> Probably I would have blocked out Patrick Farrell and the favor he asked : The Austrian exchange program had been my idea , and it was coming together the way good projects should , with enthusiasm and a high level of expectation . In the spirit of what People-2-People called the language-acquisition adventure , I was planning to open my remarks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I spent the next morning practicing sentences in my hotel room . Then , at noon , when I went downstairs for something to eat , there were two G-men waiting . <p> " American security , " they told me . They sat down across from me in the booth . I had just ordered a sandwich . <p> I understand how bureaucracy homogenizes . The process is an insidious seeping . The cells of an individual are gradually replaced with cells of the collective . It 's too slow to be dramatic , though death is not , finally , a matter of degree . Fixing me in their sights , both government men gave off the same smell of authority overconfident in its prerogatives . Liddick was an African-American , maybe thirty-five , with a moralistic way of turning down the corners of his mouth when he listened . Duncan was a white man , something over fifty , whose face had been chiseled from a block of knotty pine . <p> " This is Austria , " I pointed out . " You figure you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good global citizens will roll over for you ? " <p> This was not characteristic behavior on my part , not even close . I had n't been angry in a long while . There 's enough anger and hate and all the rest of the destructive passions out there on the streets , I liked to counsel my kids as I sat drinking one cold beer while we waited for pizza to be delivered . What 's the point of adding more to the mix ? Liddick flashed a federal marshal 's badge , then folded it back into the breast pocket of his topcoat as though it were a handkerchief , a prop for his next trick . <p> " All I 'm saying is do n't hassle me , " I told him . <p> " We 're not here to hassle you , " Duncan said . <p> " Two or three questions , tops , " Liddick amplified . They were playing a subdued variation on the good cop/bad cop skit . <p> " No questions , " I shook my head . " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? " <p> " What can you tell us about Patrick Farrell ? " Liddick asked , managing to suggest that he disliked putting the question almost as much as I was going to dislike answering it . <p> " Get the fuck away from me . " <p> " This does n't have to be nasty . " <p> " Not if you leave me alone , it does n't . " <p> " How long has it been since you 've seen Patrick Farrell ? " Duncan asked . <p> " Not counting yesterday in the park , " Liddick clarified . <p> A waiter in a short black jacket and a narrow black tie , his blond hair tied back in a braid , placed my lunch in front of me with a casual flourish . A small Austrian flag on a toothpick mast had been planted in the middle of the sandwich . He took his pad from a jacket pocket and looked with professional deference at the two marshals . <p> " They 're not staying , " I told him . <p> He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button , and Keith Jarrett 's Vienna Concert quietly absorbed the empty air . <p> " I 'm going to eat my sandwich , " I said , " and drink a cup of coffee . I 'm also going to read this newspaper . What I 'm not going to do is answer any of your questions . You want to run me in ? Is n't that what you call it ? " <p> They gave up and left . I knew that Liddick , the good cop , would be the one assigned to come back at me alone . He called from the lobby of the hotel later that afternoon . " Feel like taking a walk ? " <p> I went with him because I figured I had to deliver them a minimum level of satisfaction before they would leave me alone . They were going through forms . They believed in the efficacy of the forms they were going through . They had to rule me out . <p> The sky was clear and cold . Vienna purred functionally , purposefully , around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city 's promotional advertising . It was hard to imagine the place after the war , smashed and dirty and drawn into quarters by exhausted Allies who distrusted one another . With sufficient effort almost anything , it seemed to me as we walked , could be forgotten . <p> We followed the Ring , then went through the pleasant urban triangle of Sigmund Freud Park , where a clumsy juggler in broken sneakers practiced with three blue pins on the mat of cold grass . His ineptness frustrated him ; every time he dropped a pin , a subdued , seallike bark came out of his mouth . His clothes and a striped blanket were wadded into a leather bag on the grass . He had no home . If his juggling did not improve , he was not going to be able to buy a place to sleep . <p> We came out on the far side of the park in front of the Votivkirche cathedral , whose Gothic spires rose anachronistically in all that efficiency , all that forgetting . I did not really blame the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're mixed up in this , " Liddick assured me . <p> " Mixed up in what ? " <p> " You do n't know where Farrell is staying , do you ? I can tell . " He shook his head , and the corners of his mouth turned down . <p> " Farrell is an idealist , " I said . It was a stupid thing to say , half an apology , the other half a sop to I did n't know what . <p> " Maybe . " Liddick nodded . <p> " Do you really think you can get some sort of confession out of me that 's going to incriminate Patrick Farrell ? I do n't like Farrell . But I 'm not going to tell you I saw a picture of Eugene Debs in his wallet one time when he was buying a beer . " <p> " What if that 's not the purpose of you and me taking this little walk ? " <p> " Then what is the purpose , Liddick ? " <p> " Just passing on some friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Such as do n't get sucked into this one . You do n't want to get your hands dirty at this particular point in the picture . If Farrell contacts you again , put him off . " <p> " That 's all ? " <p> " You ever stop and think about the amount of manual labor it took to build a church like that ? " He pointed a thumb at the cathedral , in front of which we had stopped , two more tourists prepared to gawk . " I 'm not religious , so all I can see is the man-hours it took to make it happen . " " What is it that you think Farrell has done ? " <p> " It 's a long story , and I 'm not at liberty to tell you much of it , so better not to start . Man , it 's cold out here , is n't it ? You want to go inside and take a look at the altars ? Whenever I see a really first-class altar , I think about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and then going home to freeze his butt off in some kind of city shack . The wife 's got consumption or some other shitty terminal disease . And the rug rats do n't even have a rug to run around on . Meantime the altar goes up to heaven . Weird how the mind works , is n't it ? " <p> I told Liddick I did n't want to see the Votivkirche altars . <p> The Washington Post did n't break the story until ten days later , when I was back home . They got the names right , and quite a number of the details . They reported , for example , that Farrell 's ex-wife , Veronica Flanagan , had been a Maryknoll missionary and a long-distance disciple of the Brazilian liberation theorist Paolo Freire . They knew about Farrell 's Peace Corps stint in Bolivia , and stabbed at the way it had affected his political development . But there was a fundamental flaw in the picture they drew , or I wanted to believe there was . <p> In the Post version , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign intelligence services . Until the Soviet Union imploded , he had been run by the East Germans , who had tried to retire him . But when he convinced them that he remained a tradable asset , they had passed him to the Russians . On the development circuit around which he traveled , he had been particularly skilled at extracting information from people in American embassies . Immediately useful or not , classified or just not generally available , everything he picked up was grist for the intelligent miller . He was equally dexterous when it came to gaining the confidence of functionaries in Third World governments . He commanded the full arsenal of persuasion in his long-running campaign against capitalism rampant : cash in dollars , personal blandishments , appeals to resentful patriotism and under-siege ideals , and , with some frequency , his targets ' twisted sense of self-interest . <p> After the Russians became too preoccupied to expend so much money and energy in Latin America , they eased Farrell out . Except that he would not be eased . In a panic when the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high wind , he became desperate . He offered his Russian handler more information , new intelligence . He suggested new targets . He cajoled , preached , begged . The real war , against the real enemy , was anything but over . Soldiers were needed to fight that war . He was a soldier . He would never be anything but a soldier . Whatever he had to give or sell or trade away , according to the Washington Post , nobody wanted it . <p> Desperation made Farrell sloppy . His judgment wobbled . He made an approach , unauthorized and unsolicited , to a woman in the State Department , someone he had known in Managua . She had been critical of her government 's ham-handed policies in Central America , the bruising ineptness of which she had observed close up . He thought she might be accessible to reason . He wanted something he could sell to the Russians , something that would reestablish his credentials and make him interesting again . They set him up , people like Liddick and Duncan . They drew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waited a full month before going to see Farrell in the federal facility at Plains Center in rural Maryland . The blocky , grainy-brick building in which he was locked sat a quarter-mile off the highway , surrounded by fields of frozen , muddy furrows that stretched toward a horizon of thin brown trees . It was as ugly an edifice , as hostile to human life , as I ever remembered driving up to . The interior of a prison was what the inside of such a building had to be . <p> I had expected to find Farrell in duress : his rust-colored hair shaved short , his mustache excised , his face drawn in pallor . But he looked strong , almost hale . He was hyped-up and intense , wired on the coffee he drank from a Styrofoam cup . He showed the same watchful expectancy I had noticed in Vienna , as though he could not help thinking there was a way out of this one , too , if he stayed alert . On the other side of the thick , wire-reinforced glass that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round tin tray and stared into my face until I was uncomfortable . My move . <p> " I came to tell you that I did n't have anything to do with setting you up in Vienna . " <p> He nodded amiably . " That 's what you wanted to tell me . " <p> " Do you believe that ? " <p> He shrugged . " If it 's important to you for me to believe it , I believe it . What else do you want , Carrington ? " <p> " I want to figure out what it is that the newspapers got wrong . " <p> " Everything , that 's what they got wrong . Ca n't be helped . They 're tools , my man , they 're mouthpieces . Some things do n't change . Evil rides a fucking swift black stallion , does n't it ? It wears a bad-ass black cape . Always did , but I wo n't say always will . What was the Spanish expression that means hope springs eternal ? " <p> " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If they did , they could n't use it . They play by certain rules . That 's what makes them think they 're different , they 're the good guys . But it 's their game , their rules , so they ca n't help winning . " <p> " In Vienna , surrounded by all that prosperity , I started thinking that people can forget anything . If they want to , they can forget everything that ever happened to them . " <p> " That 's too metaphysical by half for me , Peter . I 'm an action guy , remember ? What is it you want to be forgetting and ca n't ? " <p> Your eyes , I wanted to say . But it was n't his eyes , it was myself in those eyes of his . It was what came bouncing back at me . " I do n't believe you let yourself get desperate , " I told him . " That 's what 's wrong about the newspaper version , is n't it ? " <p> He drummed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand prowled absently for the pack of cigarettes he had left lying there . <p> " You make a choice , " he said . " Once it 's made , it 's made . You ca n't unmake it . Unmaking it would be like , like . . . I do n't know . Something like dying , but then hanging around to watch your own body rot . The idea of that never appealed to me . " <p> He leaned toward me , but the thick glass between us mocked the gesture of intimacy his body made instinctively , the confidential slump . " They did n't get it all , " he said . <p> " Do n't . " I shook my head . <p> " Hear me out . " <p> " I ca n't . I do n't want to . " <p> " That 's the same mistake you always make , Carrington . Quit thinking for a sec and listen to me , for chrissake . " <p> " They 're taping us . " <p> " Fuck their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , 2989 Terrace Court , Apartment 301 . That 's in Arlington . You got it memorized ? " <p> " No . <p> " Sure you do . Do n't expect much in the way of bourgeois amenities . The neighborhood is real run-down . The building is , too . That 's good for you . Good for us , I mean . There 's some brand of shrubbery in the foyer . Do n't ask me to name the tree , Identification of flora and fauna is not my strong suit . Anyway , you walk into that foyer and nobody 's around and you feel around in the dirt in that shrubbery for a second , and you 'll come across a key . In a plastic bag . " <p> " A key . " <p> " Goes into the lock at 301 . " His hand pantomimed opening the door . The pantomime made me uneasy . " Which is where you 're going to find a gym bag . A Nike gym bag , actually . Black .

" <p> " This is your one big chance to make a contribution , sport . I 'm handing it to you on a platter . Trust me , if they 'd known about the place in Arlington , they 'd have hit it by now . There 's nobody left to sting , and they know it . " <p> " Good-bye , Patrick . " <p> I was angry again . At Liddick and Duncan and their co-conspirators in security . At the Washington Post , and at all the bad guys in the world who were Farrell 's enemies . I was angry at Farrell for giving me an address in Arlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . <p> " Suit yourself , " he told me when I stood up and grabbed my coat . <p> " I 'm sorry .

And on top of that , get this : I still think the good guys are going to win , one of these centuries . Hope springs eternal . I still think global capitalism carries the seed of its own destruction somewhere in its big , smothering body . " <p> " Is there anything I can send you , Patrick , anything you want ? " <p> " You mean like a subscription to Workers ' Daily News or something like that ? " <p> " If you want something , call me .

Walking away , I thought I heard him talking , sharing a secret , but I had the impression he was n't talking to me . <p> There 's a stretch on Maryland 856 south of Plains Center , past the last strip mall and the last of the suburban developments , along which the countryside becomes genuinely rural . It 's an older idea of America for which I 'm still a sucker . Swatches of woods alternate on either side of the road with cultivated fields and sweeping pastureland . A mile or two into the country , I stopped the car , parked it on a narrow bean of crumbling macadam . I got out . <p> It had begun to snow , oversized flakes falling separate and distinct from one another out of the windless sky . On a knoll in the pasture across from me , three yellow cows lowered their heads against the weather at the same moment , making identical noises of brute complaint . Behind the pasture , teenage pines in a patch of woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky overhead was gray gauze . From a place I could n't see , a dog began to bark staccato , and a door slammed , fuzzy on the crowded air . I stood there watching for a long time , listening to the becalming brush of the snow as it dropped and began to pile . For a long time , standing there , I wondered how long it was going to take me to make up my mind not to go to the apartment in Arlington to which Patrick Farrell wanted to send me . <p>
