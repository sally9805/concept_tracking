Thug-A-Licious By Noire Random House Noire It was the night before our critical championship game against the Lakers and I was chilling in the G-Spot , watching some fine-ass stripper work the stage . " Do that shit , Honey Dew ! Show these niggahs how you can work them pliers you got stuck up in your pussy ! " The girl was built with perfect proportions and every dick in the Spot was hard , including mine . The G-Spot was a gentlemen 's club for celebrities and hustlers deep in the game . I was a successful rapper and a rising baller with long paper , so I got a lot of nods of awe and recognition , and a few lame niggahs even stared at me , wishing they had my skills . I 'd had some beef with niggahs in the Spot a few years earlier , so after glancing around to make sure everthang was straight , I put my hand over the rock growing in my lap and sat back to enjoy the show . The lights went dim , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave us a few slow , nasty moves , and niggahs clapped and broke out the dollars as she bent over and spread her fine ass cheeks . She laughed and winked over her shoulder at niggahs in the audience , then squatted down and sucked a full bottle of Coke off the floor , gripping the neck with nothing but her tight-ass pussy . " Dat ai n't shit ! Dat ai n't about shit ! " some drunk poseur standing beside me withgold fronts on his teeth yelled . " Dey got dat dere shit beat in the dirty souf ! I know a ho down at Club Magic who can puff a cigarette with her pussy . And dat pussy be blowing perfect Os too ! " I prolly shoulda been resting at the crib on the night before a big game , but G had sent me a personal invitation , and I was n't about to turn him down . Some major shit had gone down between G and my cousins a few years back that coulda got bloody . By showing up alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message that Thug Williams was just as gangsta as ever . Do n't let that NBA shit fool you . There was n't a drop of bitch in my blood . Not a dime 's worth of fear was in my pockets when it came time to roll up in G 's Spot . I stood up and clapped hard for Honey Dew , then tossed her a bill that fluttered to the floor at her feet . She scooped up all her cash and gyrated her juicy ass off the stage , and I stayed on my feet as the DJ introduced a dancer called Money-Making Monique . " Goddamn ! " I leaned forward so I could see better . This jawn was rocking her hips like a motherfucker . Her long skinny fingers was rubbing and squeezing her firm breasts , and from where I was standing it looked like she mighta had three nipples . Monique was a true freak . She did some damage to that pole that had my collar choking real tight , but when the music changed and a bunch of big niggahs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies , I knew it was time for me to bounce . I walked over to the bar and gave a hustler named Moonie some respect . He was real loyal to G , but T.C. had dug him back in the day so I knew he was solid . " Whattup , " Moonie said , showing me love . I stayed cool . " Handling my shit , man . You know how it be . " " Your album is hot , man . You been hooping like a motherfucker , too . The Knicks needed you , man . They ai n't been this hot in years . Keep ' em lifted , yo . " Even though G had sent me a personal invitation , nothing in his Spot came free . I 'd dropped a grand to get in the door , and another one to cover my drinks and a piece of pussy too . I was cool with it tho ' ' cause I knew I 'd get more than my money 's worth in one of them back rooms . Some wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big game . Juicy-Mo from 136th Street walked past and grinned at me real quick like she was scared to open her mouth and speak . It was hard to believe a dime piece like her was fucking with coldhearted G , and even though she was still fine as hell , it was only a matter of time before that niggah crossed her out . I 'd sat down with G in his office and exchanged a few cool words earlier , and I could see why he was so strong in the game . That old niggah was smooth and crafty . He had absolutely no scruples and did n't give a fuck about nothing except runnin ' his dirty money game . An image of T.C. flashed through my mind and I leaned against the bar . T.C. had warned me about fuckin ' with a OG like G. " Look , Thug . That cat G took my brother Sonny out . If your cousins Pimp and Smoove wan na get shit all over their hands fucking with that motherfuckah , let ' em . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Lady got all our faith and hope riding on you . Besides , you too smart to get sucked into any pot that dirty niggah got cooking . Work your talent , man . Keep your hoop game tight . Pimp some broads . Cut all the rap music you can cut . But stay away from Granite McKay . Fuckin ' with him can be dangerous . " " Yo , Moonie . " I signaled my man . " Lemme get some Mot , man . Two bottles . " I took the bottles over to the cashier and got me a chip to room number nine . I 'd already picked out the girl I wanted to get with , and when I got to the room she was ready and waiting . Her name was Saucy and she was holding a full physical package . " Whassup , " I said and closed the door behind me . She smiled and I could n't believe how gorgeous she was . Her caramel-toned body was ripe and curved everywhere . Nice hips , big thighs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm titties . " Hey , Playa , " she greeted me with a big hug . She had on some slinky shit that was clinging tightly to her curves and felt good when she rubbed up against me . She reached over and pressed a button on the nightstand that let the cashier know I was officially on the clock . " You feeling good tonight ? " I kissed her lightly , then rubbed her bottom lip with my thumb . " I 'm feeling a little better . Now that I 'm with you . " Saucy laughed , then walked over to the small table and got me a small glass . She held out the glass and motioned toward my Mot . " Well pour me a little bit of that , Daddy , and I 'll have you feeling grand in no time . " I poured and passed . She accepted . " I know who you are , but I ai n't seen you in here before . " " Yeah , " I nodded . " It 's been a minute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank together for a few and shot the shit . Saucy mighta been a ho , but I liked her . She had an upbeat attitude and a sexy , playful personality . She recognized me and knew who I was too , and that gave me a big lift . " All right now , " she joked . She was giving me a lap dance and I told her to turn around so I could watch her from the back . I could n't believe how she was holding it . She was slim in all the right places and phat where it was needed . She also had one of the biggest , roundest asses I 'd ever seen on a slim girl . I could n't take my eyes off of it . She tossed her hands in the air and jiggled her perfect ass cheeks until my eyes got crossed . " The Knicks got a big game tomorrow , right ? You ai n't pumping out none of that supersperm tonight though , are you ? " " Umm , " I hummed , gripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball . The way she moved , I knew she had some good pussy . I could just tell . " I do n't know what you mean , baby . " She laughed and bent over at the waist . I caught a whiff of her nook-nook and licked my lips and moaned . " I heard all about your ass , " she said over her shoulder . " I remember when you used to hold the mic down with your two cousins , the ' Licious Lovers . They was just talking shit about you the other day on MTV and BET . Talking about how hard you rap and all them damn kids you got . Mama 's babies and daddy 's maybes ! Just do n't leave no babies in this room with me tonight , ' kay , big boy ? " I was the one laughing now . " You ai n't got ta worry about that , sweetie . Trust me . " She started laughing so hard she had to stop dancing and turn around to roll her eyes at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably what you tell all your baby mamas ! But I can see why a bitch would wan na reproduce with you . You fine , " she grabbed my hard dick , " you heavy . And best of all , your bank is long and you paid . " She gave me a crazy look and slapped herself on the forehead . " Then what the hell am I talking about ? I must be sleepin ' ! Who would n't wan na have your baby ! " I laughed with her , but it messed with my head when people talked shit about my kids . Not because I was ashamed of having so many of them , but because for the longest time I had n't done enough for any of them . A playa had four sons and five daughters . I 'd been real young when my first kid was born , and then the rest of them came so close together that I got paralyzed by all that responsibility . But my girl Muddah had corrected my vision on all that , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and college funds and ere'thang for my babies . Life insurance too . It was the only way I coulda convinced Muddah to marry my ass . I had to be doing right . " What else they be saying about me on MTV ? " I said , changing the subject . I pulled her back onto my lap until she was straddling my legs .
