... Is actually a problem with men . We 've ignored all the evidence of male achievement and ambition deficits and stood aside as our sons have notched a growing record of failure and disengagement . Its time we did something about it . A call to action . By Tom Chiarella // I have two sons . One is sixteen , the other thirteen . Like any boys , they are a little too muscular in their expectations from life . In a single evening , they can be sullen , sweet , hurtful , gentle , distant , funny , and full of grit Tonight I dropped the younger one at soccer practice dressed all in yellow Yellow sweatshirt , yellow Jersey , yellow shorts , yellow kneesocks . " I just wish I had yellow shoes , " he told me when he got out . " That would be the topper . " Both spend hours watching reruns of Jackass . One likes shooting baskets ; the other likes watching anime . One goes to summer camp ; the other does n't . Lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never heard of . They murmur to each other so that I am just out of earshot . They want their laundry done for them . They never clear their dishes or make their beds . They love their grandparents , but they never send them thank-you notes . They both still expect me to kiss them goodnight . They are boys . They know I am writing this article . I 've been wanting to write it for years . Here 's what I tell them : I 'm a little worried about boys . I 'VE TAUGHT AT THE SAME MIDWESTERN liberal-arts college for the past seventeen years . I was chair of one of the largest departments on campus for five years . I like working there . It has a distinguished faculty and an excellent academic program ; it 's a fine little school . I say this because I want to be clear that I am not a malcontent , that I am not some tenured jackass dyingto bite the hand that feeds me . I 'm just a little worried about boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my desk , because I was department chair , and I wondered aloud why men at our college generally received lower grades than women . The pattern was consistent , almost lockstep . Women 's average GPA was as much as a quarter of a point higher than men 's some semesters . Were women just smarter ? Did they just work harder ? It made a certain amount of sense . Female students have always seemed more focused to me , more comfortable with interpretation , more fluid in their ability to enter discussion . When it came to boys , I could often see their disengagement in the classroom . They fidgeted . They slouched . They sat in the back of the room , hidden behind the brims of their baseball caps . About this same time , I began to notice something else . The enrollment of men at our university was slipping . It is a fact of life at colleges today that women outnumber men . It certainly is at my school , where last year 's freshman class was 42 percent male . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1979 , when women surpassed men in college enrollment , I would have called it a triumph . More than twenty years later , as the numbers pile up , it begins to feel as if something , somewhere , is out ofbalance . I 'm often told that there 's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this , that the larger share of women in colleges today reflects , in part , the imbalance in the larger population . I looked that one up . There are indeed more women around than men , but it turns out males make up 51.5 percent of the population of eighteen- to **25;2955;TOOLONG college-going age . They just die faster . The shift I noticed reinforced itself in subtler ways . I watched as my colleagues expressed an increasing disdain for men in the classroom . I listened as they moaned about seminars that happened to be made up mostly of men . I went to faculty lunches dealing with disruptive students , only to realize that what we were talking about was primarily male behavior , that men themselves were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have an answer for every question . Men who did n't listen . Men who radiated indifference . Men who griped about reading lists sometimes dominated by women authors . Men who resisted the authority of the teacher . In the middle of one of these lunches , I leaned over and told a friend , " What we 're talking about here is boys . " I meant the students were n't men yet , that they had n't yet figured out what mattered . My friend shook her head . " Not really , " she said . " Some of these are girls who act like boys . " I watched as nearly every significant social problem was laid at the feet of the male student population : sexual violence , binge drinking , hazing , anti-intellectualism , homophobia , bullying . I have to say it did n't seem unfair to talk about the role of boys in these issues . High time , actually . I was on board . On the whole , boys do seem unfocused to me , a whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything about them that is maletheir physicality , their hunger for stimulation , their propensity to argue-seemed clipped by the academic world I lived in . I was not waiting for the birth of a men 's movement so much as I was looking for a little discussion , a chance to engage boys in the same way women engaged girls forty years ago . What did my university do in the face of these problems ? It formed a task force on the status of women . Its finding ? That the university needed a women 's center to augment its twenty-yearold women's-studies program . THERE IS SOMETHING ODD and forbidden about the word boy . Typing it feels a little creepy , almost pornographic . Boy . A little word , naked and weak , an iconic expression of smallness , of vulnerability . The boy alone . Scraggled hair , upward glance , the smear of ketchup on his chin . Cute maybe , but defenseless , naive , insulated , and unaware . A boy does n't have a clue . There 's something equally forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does n't sell . It does n't translate as much more than a hobbyhorse for conservative think tanks . But here 's the deal if you are a boy in this country right now : You 're twice as likely as a girl to be diagnosed with an attentiondeficit or learningdisorder . You 're more likely to score worse on standardized reading and writing tests . You 're more likely to be held back in school . You 're more likely to drop out of school . If you do graduate , you 're less likely to go to college . If you do go to college , you will get lower grades and , once again , you will be less likely to graduate . You 'll be twice as likely to abuse alcohol , and until you are twenty-four , you are five times as likely to kill yourself . You are more than sixteen times as likely to go to prison . " As long as ten years ago , we started seeing the data that showed boys were slippingbehind , " says Kati Haycock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-income and minority students . " People were still arguing : We do n't have a boys problem , we have a girls problem . It just did n't match what these data say . There 's still a lot of resistance among rank-and-file educators . " The growing achievement gap between boys and girls has landed in our laps . Fueled by slim percentages in some cases , the numbers are stacking up over time . We 're faced with the accrual of a significant population of boys who are n't well prepared for either school or work . " The problem , " says Haycock , " is what this will add up to in twenty years . " THERE 'S A BOY NAMED QUINN who lives on my street who just turned eighteen . I 've known him since he was three . These days , he 's preparing to go to college . By most measures , he 's been well served by his education . He 's in the top 10 percent of his class , and his board scores are excellent . He is a talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national-caliber high jumper . Last week he cleared six feet nine inches , higher than the doorjambs in my house . I sometimes look at those doors and picture Quinn sliding over the top of them . By most measures , he 's a boy who would n't show up as any sort of alarmingstatistic : no disciplinary issues ; he does n't drink or use drugs . He 's what you would call a good kid . When I ask him how school is in these final days , he gives me the same answer he 's given me since first grade : " Okay . " He stretches the word out , longo , resigned k . It 's always like this when I talk to boys . He is enduringit , waitingit out . I 'm always interested in what boys are reading . Last time I asked , he sighed . " Jane Eyre . " I cringe and try to think of something to say . It 's a great book that meant nothing to me until I was thirty-three and teaching it for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jane Eyre , " I say out loud , but that 's before I can locate in my memory what that paper was about . Then it comes to me . " About a chestnut tree , " I say . " I remember that much . " Quinn hold his hands out , palms up . What can he do ? His father shakes his head . They are readers , this family . " It 's a good book , " he says . The idea is to stick with it . To finish . He 's role-modeling . It 's what men do . " But you 'd think they 'd stick a little Slaughterhouse-Five in there . " Quinn stares at us and shrugs . He has nothing more to say . His face is not blank . The kid has a heart . He likes standing there with us . When he gets out of school , I tell him , he 'll be able to read the things he loves . We are silent then . Three men with Jane Eyre hangingbetween us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a place that belonged to me , was set up for me. a place that I owned in some fashion . Sitting in a classroom now with Joel Klein , the chancellor of New York City schools , it occurs to me that he must really feel that way . The room sits in the Tweed Courthouse in lower Manhattan , his office two floors above . Classes from around the city rotate in and out every two weeks . Klein , a former antitrust lawyer for the Clinton administration who took over the city 's schools in 2002 , visits often . " People try to separate out how much of this is a general boygirl thing versus how much resides in subgroups , " Klein says . " In New York City , it 's quite clearly a boy-girl thing . Eleven percent more women graduate than men , consistent across the major racial and ethnic groups . It 's a huge number . That 's a lot of kids . " He 's ready to show me charts reflecting different achievement rates at different grade levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it feels rote to me . The numbers are enervating . A couple percentage points here , a couple there . I stop him . I want to take a look at the classroom library , so we walk . Once I 'm turning the pages of a book on Lewis and Clark , I hook a finger back toward the pile of charts . " What does it all add up to ? " I ask . Klein picks up a book on Peter the Great and tilts his head . " What you see is a story about problems with literacy , with reading , that develop into a consistent increase in dropouts and lower graduation rates . " The numbers , he says , show a literacy gap between boys and girls from fourth grade through twelfth . " We need to find things they will read . " Klein sighs : " I remember how I read . It was very powerful . I read all of John R. Tunis 's books about baseball . I went forward with that . I took it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of connection you can not predict . Sports led me to literature . " He speaks of the way he pictured himself as a boy , then a man . " I thought of myself as a ballplayer . Then as a ballplayer/lawyer . Then , finally , just a lawyer . That was the way I went . We have to find paths . " I 'm thinking about Quinn then , how happy he seemed when he talked about reading articles about music , about how much he liked the books he chose for himself , like Get Shorty . " When I was a kid , " Klein says , " we had this view of education that the teacher stood up there , taught , and tried to keep each kid in the same place . Boys and girls . All the same . Each grade was a sort of franchise , with the same product . We 've learned that we have to tailor to the individual student . Boys are different . We have to get comfortable with that difference . Quickly . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have come from the world of intellectual property rights , a world where meetings were surely overpopulated by men , to parent meetings like the one he describes to me : " A school auditorium . A room of forty people . Two men . Very typical . I told both men , You have to go out and find two more men to come to the next meeting , then they tell two more . I give people an assignment . It 's how I work . Two more men . I just start with two more men . " THERE 'S A BOY NAMED GERALD who 's twenty-two who lives in West Lafayette , Indiana , with my girlfriend 's daughter . He 's had his own set of grim struggles : drugs , alcohol , an absent father . In some ways , he 's like most boys at first-withdrawn , a little sullen , his eyes on the horizon . When he can separate his anger from the gist of what he 's feeling , I 've known him to be witty , intelligent , kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not return to high school after being expelled his junior year and now scrambles from one gig to the next . Sometimes he makes panels for car doors or takes a job roofing for a few weeks or hangs drywall . Every time he gets hired , they lay him off before he gets benefits , or he fails a drug test , or he just gets fired . I worry . If he does n't have a car , he ca n't get to work . If he ca n't get to work , he ca n't keep a car . He ca n't do any better than a job where they hire him for a week or two , tease him with belonging , then toss him out . This gives him no chance to advance , no chance to supervise , no chance to grow in any sort of trade . He 's got no way to grab on to the culture of work . Nowhere to go , except Iraq maybe . They keep raising the bonus for enlistment ; they keep tempting him to put himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of flesh to them , a bullet stopper . But it must cross his mind . He 's got to be mad . He 's got to be hurting . I 'm always afraid to ask . I 'm always afraid of what my own advice would be . I AM IN KANSAS CM'J'Y . Missouri , on my way to see the commanding general of the U. S. Army Combined Arms Center . I 'm staying at the airport Radisson , eatingroom service during a tornado warning , watching Kundun , the story of the Dalai Lama 's childhood in Tibet . It 's like that these days . Everywhere I look , there 's another boy staringback at me . The Dalai Lama was a wildly curious boy-about cars , movies , machines , traveling . He laughs , he fidgets , he stares off into the distance . I imagine he farts for pleasure . He hungers for other places . And I 'm thinking about how much the monks seemed to like him , to tolerate him as a boy . They were both his followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being allowed to prosper as a boy , made him the greatest man-gentle and smart , kind and ballsy . I can still see the boy inside the man I know now . Then the electricity goes out . The next morning I drive to Fort Leavenworth , where lieutenant General David Petraeus waits for me . I 've never been to a military base in my life , although I took military-history courses in college , only because I wanted to squeeze money out of ROTC . I 'm not sure what I was expecting . Dust , I guess . Huge lots where men and women march in formation . But the base looks more like a turn-of-the-last-century college campus , replete with cottages and dormitories . There is an order to the comings and goings that one might expect but an inclusiveness I find surprising . Men shake hands . People wave . Guys in camouflage push strollers . " There 's a kind of embrace to the military , " General Petraeus says after hearing what I felt coming in . " Done right , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has six pages of handwritten notes and twenty pages of research , all balanced on his knee . He reads through his comments precisely but fields my questions as they come . He 's an academic , too , having taught international relations at West Point for two years . He had a meeting on this subject with several staff members before I arrived . " I wanted to do a little thinkingbefore we talked . It 's urgent , but I ca n't say I have a simple answer . " I tell him about the boys I know , about how I 'm concerned that the Army may be the only option for a kid like Gerald . " That 's the problem , " he says . " It may not be an option for him . We have a profile we 're looking for ; we need high school graduates who are physically fit and driven by the desire for self-improvement . We need men who are prepared to be better soldiers . " I see the same things you do . The numbers are declining among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always call them men . " I 'm concerned in three respects : as a citizen , as an educator , as a military officer . As a citizen , there 's a keen recognition that our competitiveness is defined by the education of our workforce . Beyond that , as a teacher , I can see that it 's not just economic growth we 're talking about ; it 's overall quality of life , the balance of the society itself . I always keep in mind that quality of political discourse depends on an educated electorate . " You have to try to construct a culture with great care . That 's what we do in the military . There is the sense here that every individual can be the decisive person in a key point , in a key situation . It 's a sense of ownership and connection that is n't provided elsewhere . " I ask him about a solution , about a direction for boys . He corrects me : " It 's men . " I think for a moment that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't . The answer , he means , is men . " What boys need , " he says , " are role models , parental supervision , encouragement to pursue excellence in all that they do , especially in education , where we must do whatever is necessary to keep them in school . They need direction to stay on the straight and narrow , a push to participate in athletics and extracurricular activities , help to pursue a healthy lifestyle , recognition that they must be accountable for their actions , and reinforcement of good performance . " But how do we do that ? The adults . The men . What 's our end ? " We have to embrace mentoring , " he says , " and we have to be conscious role models . Parents , teachers , coaches , bosses all have to do what leaders do-give energy and encouragement to those who soldier for them . And youngmen undoubtedly need that more than any other group in America . Indeed , if we can get them through the years during which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shrug . I 'm a little skeptical . Mentoringseems more like a buzzword than a real practice . " It has to be very conscious , " he says . " I have dozens of young officers I mentor . I typically call several each month on Saturday mornings and e-mail the others . We actually schedule the Saturday-morning calls . " When I ask if he has role models of his own , in this embrace he speaks of , he snaps off a list of ten names . Generals , teachers , coaches . There is not one among them I recognize , but he clearly knows each one for a different reason , for a different aspect of his own need . " I have to trust people who 've been there before me , " he says . " It 's not a hard thing to learn because of its inherent value . But it 's not a part of the larger culture of boys . They do n't ask for help enough to know that it 's there . " ONE MORNING LAST WEEK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bandages on their hands . When I asked , as is my way , what happened , they smiled wryly . " Bloody Knuckles , " said one . The other one laughed and peeled back his Band-Aid . " I was bleeding pretty bad , " he said , ! started in on them , haranguing them about the stupidity of potentially breakingbones in their hands weeks before they took jobs . As I was saying this stuff , I was thinking it was my own version of mentoring . But I can remember playing Bloody Knuckles . It was risky and fun . It felt good in the marrow just to think about it again . " I think we should have an Olympics of games guys play , " said one . They immediately started making a list . Two of diem gadiered , then three , then four . I watched as they listed out the events : Towel Battle . Leg Wrestling . Kingof the Buckets . Bloody Knuckles . Human Jousting . Six-Inch Punching . Indian Wrestling . Knee Football . Hand Slapper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I both know these games and do n't . I remember playing them but ca n't remember the rules . We laughed as we read the list aloud , as the boys in the class demonstrated each event . These are the games you were n't allowed to play at recess , the games your mother warned you about . Each involves some measure of violence , some risk . The point is always to make the other guy fall or hurt , bleed or flip over , lose . Boys do this . They knock one another down . They hurt one another . Then they laugh and shake it off . Their joy in relating each game was tangible . Soon they came up with a notion that this should be a campus-wide event : the Bro-lympics . And the idea had currency for a moment , the filling of some anomalous need that no man in the room could put a name to . But it was an absurdity , mostly , to consider this . We laughed at the audaciousness of it , the ludicrousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of campus , where maleness is only tolerated . They made up a poster , but the idea died under our laughter . This is a school after all . A college . We know how things go . I 'M A LITTLE WORRIED about boys , so lately I 've been thinking a lot about what can be done to help them . I 've been griping , to my friends mostly , for a decade about felt in my gut . Even ' time an article on a perceived boys crisis appears , there is a backlash , a rehashingof the numbers , a recastingof the crisis . Get this much straight : Things are much worse for black boys , for Latino boys , than they are for white ones . And for poor boys as well . I see that clearly . But why such great resistance to the idea that the problem may be that boys-all boys-have lost their foothold , their sense of a linear future , a path in the world ? Why does maleness even matter if all we do is resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse is limits testing , even self-destructive . We do n't want to extinguish it , " Camille Paglia , feminist critic and cultural provocateur , told me when I called . " In the age of terrorism , who will defend us ? Young jihadists sure are n't tempering their masculinity . Americans are in unilateral gender disarmament . " I do n't think there is a gender war . I do n't think there is any war on boys really . It 's not that conscious . It 's more like a great forgetting . The women 's movement was about making room for women , and the numbers show , in schools at least and in the workplace to some extent , that we have . The gains of girls , Kati Haycock points out , are " the result of a couple of generations of advocacy on the part of women , and girls getting the message that anything is possible . It 's a result of women constantly being reminded that they have to watch out for their financial well-being , and they could do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still getting it . That 's what 's owed the boys . It 's a matter of generational focus . We have no goals asking educators to pay attention to boys , nothing really concrete . The record shows that when we really concentrate on something like this , we tend to have progress . " We do n't have to feel threatened by the gains girls have made . We need to study them , to use them as a model for boys . The solution may be to grab on to that which is male and use it as a means to fix the problem rather than as a symptom of it . In the classroom , there 's ample evidence that certain changes could help boys prosper . They like to do their work in bitesized chunks . They need differing levels of activity , often tied to some element of competition or short-term goal . They tend to gravitate toward nonfiction in their reading-more facts , shorter pieces . They need physical activity , too , up to four recesses a day , to stay focused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world together outside the classroom . In England , gaps in achievement have been attributed , in part , to what is known as laddishness . Since hoys tend to run in packs , their values are denned by the boys who lead them . There 's a sort of antiestablishment disaffection passed from boy to boy , a sense that school does n't matter . Educators there used that pattern as a means to reinvent it . They used intensely focused mentorship , aimed at the pack leaders , to break down these attitudes , cracking into the structures that keep boys distant from school . Women forced the issue with girls . Men have to do the same with boys . As it is now , men do n't even have the language to discuss what it means to be male . Forget the Right and the Left . I am as skeptical of character training , championed by conservatives as the answer to the crisis , as I am scornful of sensitivity training , which put our classrooms in their current posture . We do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement . Men have to be willing to care about the way boys are being treated , taught , and cared for in this country and advocate for them . Find the books that boys read-they are out there-and make sure they are in the libraries and under the Christmas trees . If the classrooms do n't work , men must be in the schools-at the PTA meetings , at parent-teacher conferences , in front of school boards , in classes teaching or just talking about their jobs . Youngmen , men without children , must take a stake and volunteer to coach , to counsel , to read to kids . You ca n't wait for fatherhood to hit you in the face . Men whose children are grown must mentor a new generation of children . Select two boys , the ones who need it , the ones you know are hurting . Take a lesson from Joel Klein and convince two more men to do the same . Two more men : That 's your assignment . Go talk to boys . You do n't have to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to listen to them . Ask them who they are . The answers they give may not always make sense , but talk to enough of them and you will surely realize that boys themselves are not the problem . And it sure as hell is n't women or girls . The problem is men . Who 's Doing Something ? Not everyone has turned a blind eye to the boys crisis . Here are four organizations devoted to fixingthe problem . * 1uys Read Jon Scieszka , a children's-book author and former elementary-school teacher , wants to make reading interesting and fun for boys .
