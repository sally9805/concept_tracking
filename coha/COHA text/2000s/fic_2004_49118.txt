Rod Garcia grew up in California and attended UCLA , where he received a Ph.D . in history . Most of his recent stories for us have been set in Markovy , a fantasy world based largely on Eastern Europe . His new adventure , however , takes place in a time when being American meant choosing a side . " Stuck Inside of Mobile " throws quite a few characters into the mix , both real and otherwise ( and you might recognize a face or two from Mr. Garcia 's 1990 tale of old San Francisco , " Four Kings and an Ace " ) . The results are sure to chase away those Memphis blues . <p> " ... I 've often imagined that the last day of the world will come when some immense steam boiler , heated up to three thousand millions of atmospheres , will blow our globe into space . " And I 'll bet the Americans will have a hand in it ... " - Jules Verne , Five Weeks in a Balloon HITTING BOTTOM EUGENE BEAUREGARD Fontenot , Lieutenant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee 's skillet-hot fantail , drinking a cold cup of Confederate coffee and reading a months-old copy of Magasin d'Education , brought from Paris aboard a blockade runner . Bareheaded in the summer heat , Beau was close to forty , with shaggy black hair falling past his ears into the open collar of his rumpled gray uniform . Captivated by a French adventure story , he tried to block out the banging from below decks . Behind him the armored ram 's gun ports were thrown open for ventilation , and the black muzzle of a seven-inch rifled cannon poked out , aimed at the shining expanse of Mobile Bay , which sparkled like a sheet of diamonds in the morning Sun . Dark bobbing cotton bales drifted in with the tide . Cotton bales in the bay , the banging below , and the chicory in Beau 's coffee cup were all dire signs for the Confederacy . Signs Beauregard Fontenot sought to ignore by throwing his frayed imagination into the adventures of three make-believe Britons crossing Africa in the balloon " Victoria . " he hummed a tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mobile Bay , Rollin " cotton by the day , Stowin " sugar in the hold below , Below , below , below ... " Hey Beau , " a voice called to him , from atop the ironclad 's armored casement . " How goes the submarine service ? " " Swimmingly . " Beauregard Fontenot did not look up , still engrossed in his story - the adventurer 's ground line had tangled in an elephant 's tusk , and they were being towed about the savanna . Beau happily hummed the chorus : Hey ho , below , below , Stowin'sugar in the hold below . " We have company , " the voice called down - it was Bennett , who commanded the gunboat Gaines , standing atop the Tennessee 's steel casement to get a better view . Beau glanced up from his French magazine , staring past massive Fort Morgan , nervously searching the mouth of the bay . Out beyond the flat Gulf horizon lurked the Federal fleet , tall wooden steam-sloops , with names like Hartford , Brooklyn , Oneida , Lackawanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the war - never imagining her nine-inch smooth-bore Dahlgrens turned on him . All Beau saw was more cotton bales drifting between tiny flags marking the torpedoes in the channel . " Not Yankees , I hope . " " No . " Bennett laughed at his alarm . " Genteel visitors . General Page , a Texas congressman .... " Relieved not to see the Federal Navy bursting up the heavily guarded channel , Beau went back to his magazine , and his humming : Hey ho , below , below , Stowin " sugar ... " ... And a lady , " Lieutenant Bennett added , coming down from the casement roof to join Beau on the fantail . " Thought you should know , since they are comin " ta see the Memphis . " Beau stopped humming , squinting up at Bennett , standing between him and the morning Sun . " What sort of lady ? " " Purty one . With a purty Frenchified accent , not at all yer usual Creole drawl . " Closing his magazine , Beau got up , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any sensible sailor wants to wear blue , but the Federal blockade kept the South from importing indigo dye , forcing Beauregard Fontenot to dress like an infantryman , and drink chicory instead of coffee . Buttoning his collar , he pushed black curls away from his face , " Why did you not say so ? " " Jes " did . " Bennett nodded at the magazine . " What ya reading ? " " " Cinq semaines en ballon . ' " Beau slid the Magasin d'Education inside his coat . " That 's " Five Weeks in a Balloon " to a barbarian like yourself . " Bennett chuckled . " Hey boy , got ta git that head out of the clouds . " Whatever for ? Beau thought it but did not say it , already absorbed with the visitors boarding the Confederate flagship . Brigadier Page had deep-set eyes , bushy brows , and a neat white beard - on him gray looked good . Alongside the brigadier was a broad-beamed civilian reeking of cigar smoke , who must be the Texas congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , about as unalike as grown girls can be . One was young and petite , with ivory skin and delicate features , dressed all in white - white gown , white parasol , white ribbons in her midnight black hair . She even had a white book tucked beneath her arm , but Beau could not read the title . With her was her maidservant , maybe twice the younger woman 's age , tall and very black-skinned , with white staring eyes , wearing a plain black dress , with a black lace kerchief covering graying hair . Admiral Buchanan himself was there , his ship 's prow nose thrust high , welcoming them all aboard the Tennessee , answering amazed questions about the huge armored ram . " She was built on a high bluff above the Alabama River , near the city of Selma . Her plate was rolled in the Atlanta mills , and she draws more than two fathoms , too much to clear the Dog River bar at the mouth of the Mobile - so she had to be lifted over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dark eyes went wide . " Where did you ever find them ? " She had an entrancing French lilt to her voice , not Awlins Creole , nor pure Parisian either - Beau had heard that accent before , though he could not think where . " Why not plain Alabama mules ? " Men around her laughed , which seemed to be her intent . Admiral Buchanan explained , " Not those sort of camels , Madame . Barges lashed to the ship 's sides lifted the Tennessee over the bar . Yankee spies burned the first set of camels , but the second batch got her over . " No one mentioned the banging below decks . Beau knew why ; the great ram 's steering gear did not match her size and armor , and for more than a month this marvel of Southern engineering had been swinging at anchor , the most powerful ship on the Gulf , but too big for her steering gear , and apt to careen alarmingly out of control . Beau saw a lesson there . Admiral Buchanan ushered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to meet our submarine service . " Beau made a final stab at straightening his uniform , finishing up with a stiff bow , saying , " Lieutenant Eugene Beauregard Fontenot at your service . " Surprise visits by pretty damsels were never his forte . " But you may call me Beau . " Mademoiselle batted long black lashes , asking in coy French , " Because you are so good and handsome ? " He returned her smile . " Because I hate to be called Eugene . " Her laugh was high and musical , like a songbird 's . " Mademoiselle Emma de Pralines , " she held out her hand to be kissed . " You are our entire submarine service ? " she asked archly . " Its sole officer ? " " Yes , Ma'am . " He kissed her cool , light hand , then straightened up . " Its sole surviving officer . " Her fingers gave his hand a squeeze , and her voice fell to a whisper . " Oh , I see . " Beau doubted she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze of sympathy , and the little black ringlets framing her dark eyes . Cute young women need not concern themselves with the woes of the submarine service , aside from comforting its sole surviving member . While Beau stood entranced , Admiral Buchanan introduced the congressman , but Beau could not have cared less what the fat Texan was called , being far too concerned with Emma de Pralines . Since Grant took Vicksburg they barely got mail from Texas , making Texas congressmen more useless than most . No one introduced Mademoiselle 's slave maid , but Beau knew her well enough already , or at least women like her . She was a sharp-eyed , managing grandmother , with no time for foolish talk , but with keen opinions on everything . Beau bet she spoke French as well as her mistress , and had a wealth of clever stories . Moralist , house manager , and lady 's maid , she was the sort of woman who made her mark , even as a slave . Beau 's mother had died in childbirth , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped gave him an advantage with her young mistress ; get the maid on your side , and you were practically in the bedroom . As Emma de Pralines slowly withdrew her hand , Beau nodded at the long black hull of the blockade runner , Stonewall Jackson , moored in the lee of Mobile Point . " Does Mademoiselle wish to see the Memphis ? " " Absolument , " she replied , with a twirl of her parasol . The Texas congressman declared that he too wanted to see the Memphis - making it unanimous . Beau helped the delegation board a steam launch moored to the ironclad 's fantail for the trip over to the Stonewall Jackson . Guiding Mademoiselle de Pralines into the bow of the launch , he got a look at the book she was carrying - Voyage au Centre de la Terre . " An intriguing title , " he told her . Mademoiselle settled into the bow , deftly arranging her skirts . " Yes , it is by a new writer , Jules Verne . " " Really ? " Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Magasin d'Education was still tucked inside his uniform coat . " An outstanding storyteller . " Mademoiselle smiled . " Indeed , too bad it is all fiction . " Too bad , but charming to know they had something in common . This impromptu inspection was going famously . Beau saw Bosun help Mademoiselle 's maidservant into the boat . Big and bald-headed , with taut , shiny black skin , Bosun had worked on riverboats before the war put an end to life on the river . Beau had won him in a poker game off a carnival barker a couple of months before , and the big man had proved indispensable , being a genius with machinery and fearless on the water , qualities hard to find in the South these days . As he helped the old woman into the boat , Bosun made a curious gesture , touching his forehead , lips , and belly with the first two fingers of his right hand . Mademoiselle 's tall gray-haired maid nodded solemnly in reply , one of those odd bits of silent communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant . Brigadier Page and the Texas congressman settled in amidships , making Beau the only naval officer on the launch . He nodded to Bosun and they got underway , nosing past floating cotton bales , headed for the Stonewall Jackson . Mademoiselle de Pralines asked , " Why is this cotton adrift in the harbor ? " Sitting beside her , Beau let Bosun guide the launch . " Last night a blockade runner went out , the Speedwell , carrying cotton and tobacco . She must have been surprised by a Federal steamer and forced to lighten ship . " Leaving a small fortune in cotton to float back to where it came from . Mademoiselle looked shocked . " Do you think she was taken ? " " The Speedwell ? Depends on the Yankee chasing her . Brooklyn 's a fast ship , but not so fast as folks suppose . And a year or so ago the Florida outran the Oneida in broad daylight . So the Speedwell has a chance . " But win or lose , her cargo of cotton would do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bales out of the bay , each I worth hundreds of dollars in gold - in a British port . " You know these Union ships well , " she observed . " I used to serve on them . " As he said it , a huge column of water rose ; out of the ship channel , heaving itself straight into the morning sky . Hanging suspended for a moment , the heavy column collapsed under its own weight , then disappeared back into Mobile Bay . He told Mademoi- selle de Pralines , " You are about to hear a loud bang . " Her quizzical look turned to wide-eyed wonder as a dull boom rolled over the water . " What was that ? " He pointed to a fading white ring on the water . " One of those cotton bales hit a torpedo at the harbor entrance . " " My God , " exclaimed Mademoiselle , " what sort of weapon attacks harmless cotton bales ? " Beau shrugged , " Not a very smart one , I suppose . " The Stonewall Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of whitewash and lampblack to blend into the night . With two slim masts , no superstructure , and telescoping smokestacks , she " could run hull down , burning smokeless Cardiff coal , barely visible even in daylight , hiding behind the curve of the Earth . Someone called down , asking their business . Beau called back that they were coming aboard . What they had come to see sat supported by wooden timbers in the Stonewall Jackson 's cavernous forward hold . Shrouded in semi-darkness and surrounded by scaffolding , the Memphis was hard to make out . Instead of the straight sharp lines of a surface ship , she had a curved metal guppy-hull , making her look like some giant , goggle-eyed , steel-skinned sea creature . Pointed at both ends to slide easily through the water , Memphis had a rudder , fins , hydroplanes , and a big four-bladed propeller . Portholes ringed the small stubby conning tower . " So this here 's the submarine ? " boomed the Texas congressman , stating the obvious while everyone else stared in awe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in everyday , was awed by the Memphis . He had been aboard her numerous times , but knowing her every nook and cranny did not dim the feeling that he was seeing and touching the future . " Yes suh , " Beau softly agreed , " she is indeed a submarine . Designed by Dupuy de Lome himself . Built by Bougois and Brun for the government of Paraguay - paid for with smuggled cotton . " " But Paraguay does not even have a sea coast , " Mademoiselle de Pralines pointed out . " Why would they need a submarine ? " " Why indeed ? " Beau smiled at the thought of the Memphis headed up the Parana River , to protect Asuncion from unruly neighbors . That absurd story had been a salve for French consciences and a deliberate slap at the Yankees - who knew full well where the submarine was headed . " Suppose that 's why we had to take her off the damned Dago 's hands , " suggested the congressman with a laugh , happy to have put one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning themselves . " " Would you like to see her from the inside ? " Beau asked the congressman , realizing he did not even know the fellow 's name . General Page had already been aboard . " Not me , son . " The Texan looked askance at the narrow ladder and slim scaffolding , leading to a hatch that would barely admit him . " That 's why we have a navy . " " Could I please go aboard ? " Handing her maid her parasol , Mademoiselle de Pralines stepped to the foot of the ladder , still clutching her book , ready to climb one-handed . " By all means , Mademoiselle . " Beau bet that under her white petticoats was a body made for the submarine service . " But please let me take your book , and go ahead to see it is safe . " " Only if you'call me Emma . " Dark eyes sparkled . " Delighted . " Taking her book , he started up the ladder , with Emma right behind him . Halfway up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her catch up . Then he pointed at the forward hydroplanes . " See those fins up forward ? " She stopped to look . " Those little wings in the nose ? " " Those little wings are wonders , letting you control attitude underwater , along with ballast and trim tanks . We had none of that on the Hunley . That is what killed her first crew . She dived nose down into the mud , with no way to free her . " " How horrible . " Emma looked properly shaken , though she could hardly know the half of it . Who could ? Being stuck in the mud of Charleston Harbor , crammed in a stifling steel coffin full of terrified men , slowly suffocating . Beau still had nightmares . He set off climbing again . At the top of the curved hull sat the stubby conning tower , circled with portholes . Opening the hatch at the highest point , he moved aside for Emma , saying , " This is a historic moment . " " Really ? " She peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the dark . " How so ? " " No woman has ever been aboard the Memphis . " he knew that was a stretch - the Memphis had been built in France . It would be a miracle of nature if some Frenchman had not already said this . " You will be the first . " " Pish , this does not count . " She swung her legs through the hatch , no mean trick when wearing a ball gown . " We are in the hold of a ship . I want to travel beneath the sea . " Emma disappeared into the submarine . Beau waited for her to clear the ladder , then climbed down to join her , knowing that in the cramped space beneath the conning tower there was just enough room for the two of them to stand close together , between the helm and hydroplane controls . Turning his back on the ladder , he found Emma only inches away . Her warm scent and Paris perfume drowned out the cold , wet , submarine smell . " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service does not wear hats . " Or white silk ball gowns . " Still want to be underwater in her ? " Beau asked . " It gets pretty dark when you close the hatch . " " Then how will we see ? " She refused to be intimidated by cold dark surroundings . Beau reached over , flipped a switch , and low illumination came from two glass bulbs overhead . " De Chagny platinum-filament lamps , designed for use in the mines . Everything is electrified . Big batteries of electrical cells lie beneath your feet , for running the lights and electric motor . " She oohed appreciatively at the electric light . " And even more important , internal pressure doors . " He pointed out the big circular pressure doors at either end of the cabin . " That is what killed another Hunley crew . Water came in through the open hatch and filled up the ship . These doors divide the Memphis into three watertight parts , so a leak in one will not sink the whole ship . " " Suh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She eyed him slantwise through black lashes . " Were all the crew of the Hunley drowned ? " " Just about , " Beau admitted . " Hunley himself drowned inside her . Once the submarine commander and his first officer got out . But the commander was killed on his very next trip , along with all of the new crew . " " How ghastly , " she declared . " What about the first officer ? The one who escaped with his commander ? " Beau shrugged . " He stands before you . " " Oh . " Her voice softened again . " I see . " Maybe she did . For someone who toured naval vessels with a parasol and a lady 's maid , she actually had a sort of down-to-Earth sense about her . Beau liked that . Emma ran a slim hand over one of the hemispherical doors , asking , " What is on the other side ? " " Here , I will show you . " he undogged the aft door and swung it open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memphis had no internal cabins or divisions , and just the single bit of deck beneath the conning tower . The dim line of platinum-filament bulbs led clear to the end of the ship , and the submarine 's ribs formed closed circular rings shrinking as they receded . Batteries of electric cells , the great hand-operated crank shaft , the electric motor , steering gear , pipes , and compressed air tanks were all fully exposed . " Incroyable . " Emma shook her head in wonder , then turned back to him . " What is behind the forward door ? " As if in answer , the forward pressure door undogged itself , swinging open to reveal a man standing in the bow . Red-haired and handsome , he wore seaman 's clothes and looked a bit younger than Beau , with alert eyes , a strong straight nose , and the beginnings of a beard . He acted as shocked as they were . " Pardon ! Je suis desolee .... " Beau never found out what the fellow was sorry for , because the redhead 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips broke into a smile , " You must be the man I have crossed the Atlantic to see . " " How so ? " Beau recognized the fellow as one of the Frenchmen who came with the Memphis , but he was not an engineer . Beau had put him down as a newspaper reporter , or some other sort of professional busybody . The oddest sort of people came to America these days , just to see the war . " You have my book . " The Frenchman pointed at Voyage au Centre de la Terre . Beau nodded to Emma . " This book belongs to Mademoiselle , I was but holding it for her . " " Even better . " Spoken like a Frenchman . He managed a bit of a bow despite the close quarters . " Emma de Pralines . " She held out her hand . Leaning through the pressure door , he kissed it . " Jules Verne , at your service . " Beau held up Voyage au Centre de la Teire . " Not this Jules Verne ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you not like my book ? " " I have not read it , " Beau confessed . " But I am halfway across Africa in your balloon . " " And I hope you are enjoying the trip ? " " Splendidly ! " Anything to distract him from the deadly adventure around them . " You have a marvelous imagination . " " Wait until you get to the Center of the Earth . " Emma looked a shade less surprised than she might have been . Peering past the novelist 's shoulder , she asked , " What is the big hand crank for ? " Verne looked behind him . The huge hand-operated crankshaft ran the length of the ship , passing under the short conning tower deck . " Electricity is a wonderful agent , obedient , rapid and easy , conforming to every use , but batteries of electric cells last only so long . Ten crewmen turn the crank to keep the submarine going , and at the same time recharge the batteries . Six men sit in the stern , four in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Beau tells it . " His Hunley stories had impressed Emma . " Do you have a crew for the crankshaft ? " " Not yet . " Beau winced a bit . " There is talk of using galley slaves . " Jules Verne looked shocked . " Surely you jest ? " " Would that I were joking . " By now Beau had seen plenty that would have sounded ludicrous before the war . " Someone will be found to run her , " Emma assured the men . Her certainty surprised Beau . " You sound like you would " man " her yourself . " Dark eyes framed by black curls looked haughtily back at him . " Why not , suh ? Are only men allowed to drown for what they believe ? " " Do you believe that much in Southern freedom ? " Four years of ceaseless killing had Beau questioning his own commitment . " Absolument ! " Emma acted amazed at the question , totally undeterred by Beau 's horror stories . " Tres bien . " Verne applauded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beau arched an eyebrow . " Another friend of Southern freedom ? " Jules shook his head , " No , I am a Frenchman , and will not take sides in your war . " How comforting to know that right or wrong , you could always count on the French to criticize your choice . " Why then come aboard ? " Anyone who sailed with the Memphis was not just siding with the South , but taking a tremendous risk as well . It was safer by far to ride full tilt into a battery of Federal Catling guns than to join the submarine service . Verne 's voice dropped , " I want to write a novel about a submarine voyage for thousands of leagues beneath the sea . I have read every book there is on hydrostatics and the theory of submarine navigation , but books take one only so far .... " he patted the metal hull , " Here is the real thing . " Beau rolled his eyes . With Grant battering at the gates of Richmond , and Sherman marching on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South must accept help from whomever , and for whatever reason . Still it seemed ridiculous to go to war just to write about it , or at least it did to Beau . To Jules Verne it made perfect sense . " When I found out that Bougois and Brun was shipping a real submarine to Paraguay , I signed on as supercargo . They were happy to have someone accompany the Memphis for free - someone unconnected with the firm . I thought they merely wanted to save on expenses , so imagine my shock when Paraguay turned out to be Mobile , Alabama . Not that I have a thing against Americans . " That was good to hear . With Americans so eagerly killing each other , one could hardly blame the French for lending a friendly hand . Beau helped Emma de Pralines out of the submarine , leaving Jules Verne aboard the Memphis , happily practicing at the hydroplane controls . As the steam launch chugged back to the Tennessee , the Texas congressman declared that submarine warfare would save the South from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaves aboard were stone deaf . Bosun and the lady 's maid exchanged slight smiles as the congressman prosed on about the upcoming elections . Yankee elections , of course . What did the South have to vote about ? How depressing to violently rebel against the Federal government , kill tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers , and still have your fate hang on the fall elections . Washington was inescapable , unless Bobby Lee managed to burn the place down . " Congress hates Lincoln , " the Texan confided , " and would impeach him if they could , while the Democrats are pushing General McClellan on a peace platform . Yankees are sick of war . Volunteering has ceased , and Grant drives on Richmond over the bodies of draftees . Aside from a few Black Republicans , the North yearns for peace . " So does the South , thought Beau , though he did not say it . Beau had no faith in posers like McClellan , who called his old commander-in-chief the " original gorilla . " Only a Democrat could think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would most likely give General McClellan a bigger thrashing than Robert E. Lee ever did . Wait for the Democrats to end the war , they would be fighting until kingdom come - unless Memphis came to the rescue , breaking the blockade and driving the U.S. Navy from the Confederate coasts . Then anything could happen . Old Abe had history against him ; no president had won reelection since Andrew Jackson , thirty years ago . Memphis and McClellan might yet save America from a Lincoln dictatorship . Emma shouted excitedly , " Look , a man walking on water ! " Following her finger , Beau saw a shrimper standing atop the Speedwell 's bobbing cotton bales , claiming a shoal of them for his boat . Beau hoped they came for him before the turning tide took him back toward the torpedoes . Aboard the Tennessee , he said a sad good-bye to Emma de Pralines , grief-stricken to be parting so soon . Emma told him not to fret . " We shall surely be seeing each other again . " " Soon , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why then , soon it shall be , " Emma replied warmly . Beau felt so buoyant he could have walked back to the Stonewall Jackson by himself - but he took the steam launch instead . On the way he asked Bosun , " Did you know the young Mademoiselle 's maid ? " Bosun nodded . " Everyone knows Mama Love . " Beau certainly did not know Mama Love . " Who is she ? " " She 's the Hoodoo , that 's who she is . She comes from Louisiana . People down there come from miles around to ask her questions , an " see her do magic . " " Is she a slave ? " " Long as anyone knows . She belongs to the de Pralines . They 're from Awlins too , though a lot of them left when the Yankees came . " And now Admiral Farragut , who took New Orleans with a wooden fleet , was hanging off the bay , waiting for ironclads to help batter his way into Mobile . Back aboard the Stonewall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which reminded him of a verse from the Bible : " Egypt shall gather them up ; Memphis shall bury them .... " Bosun grinned back , then quoted the next verse : " The days of punishment have come ; the days of recompense have come . " Beau was a bit taken aback , not guessing his slave knew scripture so well . " I see you know your Hosea . " Bosun merely went on : " Israel knows ! The prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is insane , because of the greatness of your iniquity .... " Beau cut him off , saying frostily , " I am familiar with the text . " He was being made light of by his own property , but you can not whip a man for quoting Hosea . Not even in Mobile . Next morning , huge cranes lifted the Memphis out of the Stonewall Jackson 's forward hold . Sailors aboard ship and crowds of Mobile citizens in pleasure craft cheered the metal fish , flying through the air before she even took to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath as the cranes lowered Memphis into the bay , hoping the submarine did not head straight for the bottom . She floated , serenely and evenly . Beau exhaled , relieved that the submarine had not come all the way from France just to fill up and founder . He boarded at once , with Jules Verne right behind him . Flinging open the conning tower hatch , Beau peered inside . No sign the submarine was taking on water . He had checked and rechecked the hull and seals , but the water in the bay was bound to find any crack he missed . Descending into the conning tower , he and Jules did a complete check of the submarine , finding the seals secure , the air tanks full , and the batteries charged . His novelist-cum-first officer grinned at him . " Nothing left to do except see if she runs . " Beau nodded , telling the Frenchman to take station at the big metal double-wheel controlling the hydroplanes . Climbing up to the open hatch , Beau signaled to release the lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the fighting took place in front of an audience , like the folks who lined the bluffs above Memphis to watch riverboats do battle for the city . In France , fifteen thousand spectators crowded the cliffs at Cherbourg to see the Alabama duel the U.S.S. Kearsarge ; so many people wanted to view the war that the railroads ran special excursion trains from Paris . With his head and shoulders sticking up through the conning tower hatch , Beau could still reach the helm wheel , as well as the compressed air valves and the electrical controls . Flipping a switch , he fed current to the electric motor , and slowly the Memphis began to move under her own power . He turned the helm to swing her away from the Stonewall Jackson , aiming for the ship channel at the center of the bay . More cheers erupted . Beau found such enthusiasm embarrassing - Memphis was supposed to be submarine , but just circling about on the surface more than pleased the multitudes . Time for the true test . Reaching behind him , Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface was Emma waving excitedly to him from a nearby boat . The view from the conning tower portholes was not nearly so clear , since they were lower down and already splashed with water . Beau could see well enough to avoid the floating spectators , but he could no longer make out faces , nor hear their cheers . Beau took a deep breath , remembering his last dive aboard the Hunley , and the terrified scramble to escape as Charleston Harbor came rushing in , drowning all but two of them . He had sworn he would never go down again , not caring if they called him a coward , or crazy . Instead Beau let others throw their lives away . But Memphis was not the Hunley . Hunley had been a suicide machine , a hand-cranked boiler plate submarine , built by a doomed designer taking his first stab at naval construction . Memphis was designed by the greatest living naval architect . In addition to forward hydroplanes and internal watertight doors , Dupuy de Lome had given her a double hull , compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything nineteenth-century science could offer . Beau called down to Jules , " Get set to dive . Down hydroplanes . " Beau opened the ballast tank valves . Air roared out of the tanks in a thunder of bubbles , as water rushed in through flooding hatches no longer held closed by pressure . Slowly Memphis lost buoyancy , starting to go down by the nose , water curled up , lapping at the portholes . He could see the flat surface of Mobile Bay rising to engulf him , covering the forward portholes , then rising up the side ones at a slant . When the last porthole was covered , he was underwater . " Hydroplanes level , " he called out . There was a periscopic mirror fixed above the helm , allowing him to see straight ahead so long as Memphis was just below the surface . He peered into the slanted mirror . And saw nothing . Just murky grayness , light at the top , getting darker at the bottom . Beau realized the periscope was already underwater . He glanced at the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising . Memphis was still headed down , diving for the bottom , plunging out of control . " Up hydroplanes , " he shouted , at the same time shutting off the electric engine , before they tried to bore a hole in the bottom of the bay . " Help me ! " cried Verne , hanging one-handed on the big double wheel , unable to make it turn . Beau threw himself at the wheel , adding his weight to Verne 's - both big wheels began to turn together . Triumph surged through him .... Cut short by a sickening crunch . Thrown from the wheel by the blow , Beau was tossed against the forward pressure door . Blackness descended . At first Beau thought he had been knocked out , but slowly he realized he was awake - it was the submarine 's lights that had gone out . Memphis had come to a dead stop . Without lights or engine , everything sounded unnaturally silent , except for a shrill rushing that he thought was his head ringing . But it was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water pouring into the forward compartment , audible even through the pressure door . Memphis was nose down in the muddy bottom , and fast filling with water . The sea does not belong to despots . Upon its surface men can still exercise unjust laws , fight , tear one another to pieces .... But at thirty feet below its level , their reign ceases , their influence is quenched , and their power disappears . Ah ! sir , live ! Live in the bosom of the waters . There only is independence ! There I recognize no master , there I am free ! - Captain Nemo OH MAMA BLACK WATER ROARED into the sub , and Beau pictured the Hunley 's first crew , suffocated in Charleston Harbor mud . He had helped haul out the dead , crawling into that cramped , stinking , airless space , dragging on waterlogged bodies - as close to asphyxiation as he ever thought to get , until now . Now he was in the metal coffin . Even if the forward pressure door held , how would they ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water in the forward cabin , and just him and jules working the big hand-crank in the dark ? Assuming the crank still worked . Beau called out in terror , " Jules ! Are you there ? " " Yesh . I can not shee . " Verne did not sound in good shape . " Lights , s'il vous plait . " " How ? " Beau was totally in the dark . Jules Verne 's voice came back slurred and weak . " Paired switches , either side of the helm . Parallel circuits . all electrical systems duplicated .... " Beau felt about for the switches , finding the port one worked - being right-handed , he had barely noticed the duplicate . They had light . Jules looked horrible , with his face paralyzed on the left side , one eyelid drooping , and saliva dribbling from his mouth , which would not close properly . " Wash happened ? " " We are on the bottom , nose down in a mudbank - probably the Middle Ground bar . With the forward compartment holed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jules mumbled , " taking on too much water . Did the electric motor fail ? " " No , I turned it off before we hit . " " Good , the motor runs backward too . Jush rehearse the current . " Verne waved at another pair of switches . Locking the hydroplanes in the up position , Beau centered the helm and tried the engine . Memphis shuddered and started to lift out , her heavy nose dragging on the Middle Ground bar . Beau heard sand scraping on the hull , as Verne feebly suggested , " Blow ballast .... " Beau reached for the knobs . " ... but shut exhaust valves firsh . " His hand froze on the ballast control . During their wild plunge to the bottom he never bothered to close the ballast exhaust valves . If Jules had not warned him , he would have blown their precious compressed air into the bay . Sheepishly Beau shut the valves , then shot air into the tanks , driving water back out the flooding hatches . With a soft hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though at an alarming angle . " Craft 's nose heavy , " Verne croaked needlessly . " Compensate with the trim tanks . " Trim tanks ? Beau had neglected to set them before diving . Hunley had no water ballast at all - much less trim tanks . Memphis might be a wonder of modern science , but there were far too many things to do at once . Shutting off the electric motor , he adjusted the trim tanks , flooding the aft tanks and filling the forward ones with air . he needed another pair of hands to work the valves and switches , while he kept hold of the helm . And someone to watch the depth gauge while he looked where they were going . But Jules Verne seemed in no condition to do that . Beau asked , " Were you hit hard ? " " No . Neuralgia . Nerve condition . Stabbing headaches , and sometimes left-side paralysis - but never this badly . " " Why did you not tell me ? " And Beau thought his nerves were shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzing . " And Verne had never tried to control a plunging submarine before . Beau needed a new hydroplane operator as well . " Look . " Verne pointed up at the conning tower . " The surface . " Light poured through the portholes . Climbing into the conning tower , Beau saw they were indeed on the surface , drifting slowly backward , away from the Middle Ground - still badly down by the nose . They did not look likely to hit anything , but he opened the hatch to get a better view . Cheers greeted him , wild applause rolling across the water from the assembled boats . His audience was blissfully unaware that Beau had nearly wrecked the submarine . Seeing Memphis disappear beneath Mobile Bay , then rise triumphantly to the surface , bystanders naturally assumed they had witnessed a successful test , not a near catastrophe . With no hat to wave , and alarmingly low in the water , Beau turned on the electric motor to get headway . He ran backward for a bit , then remembered to reverse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more happy cheers . Guiding the Memphis back alongside the Stonewall Jackson , he ended the trial run by having the crippled submarine hoisted back into the forward hold . Again , to thunderous applause . Beau was not nearly as impressed , nor were his superiors . Having this new submarine practically duplicate the first disastrous dive of the Hunley sent the submarine service 's stock plummeting . Not only was he suspect , but he had now tarnished the Memphis as well - not to mention holing her , flooding her , and nearly sinking her . And he was the one who was supposed to know submarines . Only one good thing came out of this mess , the opportunity to be personally congratulated by Emma de Pralines . Two days later , he took her in a rented carriage along the seven-mile Shell Road , a bayside boulevard of hard oyster shells , and the best carriage road in a countryside better fit for riding than driving - but it was bad enough to be uniformed like a soldier , without actually mounting a horse . Meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flirtatious praise as he guided the buggy . It bolstered his ego to hear himself called a " brave Southern knight of the sea " - though he winced at the image of riding the waves in full armor . At the end of the oyster shell road was a public house where Beau found the food delicious , but the prices outrageous . Beer was twelve dollars a bottle , and homemade cherry wine thirty-five dollars . Coffee was three dollars a cup . Even butter for their bread cost a dollar a pat . His bill for two light vegetarian lunches , risotto a la milanese , with sweet yams and salad vinaigrette , plus tip , topped a hundred dollars - but then it was only Confederate money , and the coffee was real . Fortified by risotto and cherry wine , he told Emma her praise was undeserved . " Fact is , my first test dive nearly wrecked the ship . " Emma looked shocked . " Surely they do not blame my brave knight for that ? " " Some blame the French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others blame me . But most blame me and the French . " " How terribly unfair , " protested his pretty companion in her soft French accent . Beau shrugged , spreading a couple of dollars " worth of butter on his yam . Faith in the Memphis had sunk considerably , adding to the woes of the submarine service . " I am hard put to find a crew . Folks figure that if a Confederate submarine will drown you , a French one will only do worse . " Reducing Beau to employing a neuralgic novelist , and the only slave he owned . Right now Jules was overseeing repairs in the forward hold of the Stonewall Jackson , while teaching Bosun to work the hydroplanes . " It is hard to promote a battered boat by arguing that it has not killed anyone yet . " Though that could happen on the next dive . " Pish ! We shall find a crew , " she assured him . " You will see . " Emma did not realize how desperate things were . Beau told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crankshaft . " " Absolutely the perfect crew ! " Emma leaped to agree . " My family could supply them - men right off the rivers , boatmen , firemen , deck hands , serious workers not given to skylarking . " " And these men will fight for the Confederacy ? " Working on the Mississippi was not the same as going to war . Emma had not the slightest doubt . " If Mama Love says so . " " Mama Love ? " Beau knew of the Hoodoo woman 's powers from Bosun , but never thought to use them for naval recruiting . " My old nurse . You met her that first day when I toured the Memphis . " Emma had not really introduced them , but the stern black woman had certainly made an impression . " Every fireman and Texas tender on the lower river trusts in Mama Love . Any steamer Mama Love dislikes is lucky to get a boat crew , but if she says the right spells , they will gladly serve on a submarine . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aghast . " Do you not see a moral dilemma ? " Emma de Pralines looked blandly back at him . " What dilemma ? " " Using slaves for such dangerous work ? " Slaves dug trenches , walked picket lines , and served aboard Confederate men-of-war - but a faulty French submarine ? She snorted . " Do you think it is unsafe ? You will be going too , wo n't you ? " Years of war had made " safe " a relative term - target firing by the big Brooks gun at Fort Powell , across the bay , shook the windows while they talked . Beau conceded that he totally trusted the Memphis . " There , you see . " Emma triumphantly sipped her cherry wine . " Slave or free , what does it matter if they are able and willing to do the work ? Men make too much about rights and freedoms ; otherwise we would not be at war . " Beau had never thought of it that way . " Are women so indifferent to freedom ? " Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all slaves . Every wife , every girl child , spinster , and kept mistress , every woman living in a man 's house is a slave . Men make so much of freedom because they have it . " " Why talk of slavery between men and women ? " Beau had only owned one slave in his whole life , and Bosun was enough . " I thought you were one of those women who wants to equal men . " Emma de Pralines 's smile widened . " Why so ? Man as my equal I can barely imagine . Man as my master I can easily handle . " Beau shook his head in amazement . " You have such a way of talking . " " Not a word of this is talk , " Emma declared stubbornly . " I will gladly serve aboard your submarine , alongside the meanest slave . Southern freedom means that much to me . " Beau did not doubt it , merely reminding her , " We are looking for big men , to turn a four-bladed propeller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful , " she said . " I am small , not needing much space or air , and able to work comfortably in cramped quarters . My hands are nimble and adept at turning valves and switches , and I am blessed with an excellent memory , easily finding things with my eyes closed . I could do all the little things that keep the submarine running . " Like adjusting trim tanks . Beau saw he had better switch subjects before Emma started making sense . " Do you know there used to be great fields of indigo here , before cotton covered everything ? Now we must import indigo - when we can . " Emma raised an eyebrow . " I would not think a sailor cared what people planted . " " Indigo blue is the only true color for a sailor , because it does not show seawater stains . " " Sensible , " she agreed . " But if everyone wore blue , how would we know which side you were on ? " Beau snorted at her ignorance . " Soldiers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sailors only need know their ship . Do you think Drake or Hawkins wore uniforms ? " She smiled slyly . " Well , if they did not , I sha n't either . " By the time the repairs were completed , Bosun had mastered the hydroplanes . He had been a helmsmate on the river , and guiding steamers through twisting channels , over sand bars and sunken snags , turned out to be perfect preparation for submarine work . Bosun was already used to navigating in the dark , getting his depth from an invisible leadsman , while knowing that the least mistake would bring the Big Muddy pouring in through a rip in the hull . Beau still wanted to know , " Would you be able to work underwater ? Totally enclosed in iron ? " Bosun smirked at the question . " With massa Beau beside me , I will not fear water , nor iron . " He was not used to thinking of himself as " Massa Beau " - but he supposed it was so . " Why is my presence so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I served under good captains and bad ones . Bad captains can get a man killed ; good ones will get you home . " Hardly believing he had won such loyalty on a hand of cards , Beau decided to test his unsuspected popularity . " Would more river men work the submarine ? Would they turn the hand crank ? " Bosun nodded eagerly , " If Mama Love says so . " Beau 's ego deflated . " This Mama Love is a noted nautical engineer ? " " Mama Love sees the future , " Bosun replied proudly . Beau knew it was pointless to argue . So far as slaves were concerned , the power of such women was absolute . Beau himself had taken it in with his nurse 's milk , hearing the lullabies , and later the spirit tales . His father had always been tickled by the way little Beau would instinctively reach out to black women for comfort and approval . Beau asked his slave , " Would Mama Love say yes ? " " Maybe , maybe no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask her , " Beau ordered , since it could hardly hurt , and a single success , even with a slave crew , would securely launch the Memphis . For the next test dive , Beau planned to have Bosun 's steady hands on the hydroplanes , and use Jules Verne only as a technical advisor . On the big day , everyone turned out to see them off . Emma was accompanied by Mama Love , who seemed to give stern blessing to the enterprise , or at least did not object to Bosun going aboard . While Beau stood with Emma on the dock beside the Memphis 's open hatch , the Texas congressman made another speech , being introduced as " his Honor " Aaron Maria Spinoza . And Beau thought Eugene was bad . He asked Emma , " Since when is a congressman honorable ? " " Sush , " she hissed . " He was a judge in Texas . " So much for Texas justice . Maria Spinoza 's speech was the same old politician 's lament , about how Southerners were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple necessities like butter , coffee , tea , soap , bacon , and glue , not to mention bigger things like steel rails , rolling stock , and rifled cannon - all because of the ring of black steamships circling Southern ports . But politicians never took proper credit for their hand in all this . It was deranged Southern Democrats who decided to make war on the United States Navy , not Lieutenant Eugene B. Fontenot , happily serving his country at the time . War with the United States had left Southern sailors with the insane choice of fighting against their home states , or committing naval suicide . Farragut had gone north in disgust , and now commanded a wooden flotilla bigger than the entire seagoing Confederate Navy . Southerners who stayed loyal were reduced to untried weapons and suicide attacks . Yet the South could have had powerful naval allies . England and France were ready to break the Union blockade with their oceangoing ironclads - but only if the Confederacy renounced slavery . Which congress would never do , acting as if freeing the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fools think Abe Lincoln would do ? Having thrown Southern sailors headfirst into the harbor , telling them to take on the world 's best navy barehanded , politicians could at least have the decency not to cheer . His " honor " finished with the fervent hope that Memphis would blow the Federals clear back to Washington , " like a pocket-sized Popocatepetl . " Folks applauded the congressman , who had not heard from his constituents in over a year . Jules Verne stepped down off the dock , onto the deck of the submarine . Smiling to Beau , he asked , " Was that the great Southern oratory I have heard praised so mightily ? " " Not by a Yankee mile . " Beau laughed at the suggestion . " When I was a boy , I sat on the knee of John Randolph of Roanoke , a congressman from a fine old Virginia family , going clearback to Pocahontas . He was a famous orator who debated the likes of Jefferson and Jackson , Patrick Henry , Daniel Webster , Henry Clay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once asked him who was the best of all , and he told me the greatest Southern orator he had ever heard was a woman . " " Vraiment ? " Jules looked surprised . " What was her name ? " " John Randolph did not say , " Beau admitted . " All Randolph said was that she was a slave and a mother , and her rostrum was an auction block . " Verne stared at him for a long moment , then opened the hatch and descended , silently taking a seat in the forward cabin bench , beside the hand crank . That left the only good-bye that mattered . Beau stepped off the dock into the open hatch , finding the ladder with his boot toe , then he smiled up at Emma de Pralines . She leaned down to bring their faces together , whispering , " Come back to me safely . " " My fondest intention , " Beau confessed . " Good . " To show her appreciation , Emma kissed him , boldly and forcefully in fine French fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau never had a submarine voyage get off to a better start . When their tongues untangled , Emma told him , " Next time , take me with you . It will be worth your while . " Cheers rolled over the water , as sailors and townsfolk applauded the kiss , turning another perfectly natural act into cause for loud celebration . Beau grinned in delight , saying , " Mademoiselle is most persuasive . " Emma smiled back at him from the dock . " Only because I believe in you , and the Memphis . " Beau too believed in the Memphis . If anything could break the Union blockade , it was this submarine . Standing at the helm , with just his head and shoulders above water , he was level with the flat surface of the bay , seeing the world in a whole new way . Here he could feel the immensity of the water , and see just how helpless the ships were that sat on it . Even the mighty Tennessee , with her six-inch armor , floated on a bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute advantage . Guns must batter at the exposed parts of the enemy , and could easily be turned aside by armor ; but armor did not work underwater , since the incompressibility of sea water focused the blast into the hollow hull . All Beau had to do was put holes in those thin hulls , letting in the sea . But first he had to show that the Memphis could maneuver without killing her crew ; then they could worry about damaging the enemy . Bosun was already at the hydroplane wheel , eyes fixed on the depth tube , his feet braced fore and aft , feeling the balance of the boat . jules had come up with a check list , to make sure the electrical systems functioned and the trim tanks were properly set . Then he coached Beau on dive procedure , admitting , " Last time I over controlled . " " Over controlled ? " They had been wildly out of control . " You ordered " down hydro , ' " jules explained , " and Memphis dived . Hydroplanes should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hydrodynamic descent instead of hydrostatic one . " Another wonder of the underwater world , " up hydros " to go down . Beau closed the hatch and got underway , then opened the dive tanks . Bubbles roared past his head as the Memphis slid under the surface , but this time there was no wild bucking or headfirst plunge into the mud . Memphis plowed easily through the still bay , maintaining depth with up hydroplane and negative buoyancy , flying through the water , rather than floating . Unfortunately , they were flying blind . Peering through the conning tower windows into murky bay water , Beau could barely see the nose of the sub . If anything was ahead of them , his first warning would be the crash of contact . He called down to Bosun , " Up hydroplanes . " Immediately , there was a flash of sunlight as the periscope broke the surface , but the lens was covered in droplets , and all he saw was a blur . Memphis needed a taller periscope , one that did not fog so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with light shining in through the ring of portals around the hatch . Rather than peer through the portholes , he popped the hatch to get a better view . Applause greeted him , but by now he was used to it . What pleased him more was seeing they were right on course , headed out into the deep channel , away from the anchored ships and the Middle Ground . Even if he could not see , he could still chart a course across short distances . And the Memphis only needed to go a few hundred yards to make a successful torpedo run . Or so Beau assumed . There was only one sure way to find out . Beau had arranged for a David to haul the Memphis out into the Gulf , to go hunting for the Union fleet . Davids were small steam torpedo boats that were trimmed to run with just their funnels and hatches above water , and armed with a spar torpedo . At night they were nearly invisible , but even by day they could hide low down close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work the crank , the Memphis could not travel any great distance - or recharge her batteries - but she could make a mock torpedo run , if they found the right target . He signaled to the David , who took them under tow , hauling Memphis down the main channel toward the sea , past Fort Morgan , and the torpedoes at the harbor entrance , marked by a series of black flagged buoys , ending with a red one . These torpedoes were beer kegs filled with powder , studded with fulminate tubes and percussion fuses , and anchored a fathom or two beneath the surface , set to blow up whatever bumped against them . Beau had small faith in fixed torpedoes , telling Jules , " Such floating horrors will not stop Farragut . " " Though they may sink the ship beneath him , " the Frenchman pointed out from his perch below . Maybe , but Beau had served under Farragut , and knew what the old Admiral 's answer would be - " Damn the torpedoes , and full speed ahead ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named for the Admiral 's home state . Until Federal ironclads arrived , the armored ram remained the mightiest ship in Alabama waters , though her deplorable steering kept Tennessee from turning Farragut 's wooden fleet into kindling . Memphis had gotten over her steering problems . Bosun brought a sense of balance to the business , which the submarine service had sadly lacked . His firm grip on the hydroplanes was vastly superior to Jules Verne 's palsied enthusiasm . Jules was much more useful sitting in the forward cabin , giving advice through the open pressure hatch , and helping with the valves and switches - though after that kiss good-bye , Beau found himself wishing it was Emma de Pralines lending him a hand . Jules kept complaining at the lack of scenery underwater , saying , " Submarine travel is boring , surrounded by cold steel , unable to see outside , enduring all the dangers of ocean travel , with none of the advantages . My submarine will have huge pressure-proof windows , and electric reflectors able to light the sea for a half-mile around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only one able to see Fort Morgan fall behind them , as they entered the final length of channel between Sand Island and the South East Shoal . Ahead lay the Gulf , as smooth and dark as leaded glass . Searching the horizon for the black masts of blockading steamers , he asked Jules , " Why stop at windows ? Why not a library and smoking saloon , with a piano organ to while away the hours underwater ? " " Of course , and a dining room , galley , and private cabins . Nonetheless , it is good to know where you are going . " Too true . Seeing the Gulf of Mexico at surface level was unnerving . Land slipped swiftly out of sight below the near horizon . Beau was within swimming distance of the North American mainland , but the great land mass had shrunk down to Mobile point , and a few big dunes poking out of the water behind him , notably Sand Island and West Sand Island . Somewhere ahead of him , Farragut 's tall steam sloops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a thread of smoke on the horizon . Sailors on the mastheads would be keeping a keen watch to landward , but Beau was confident he would see them first . He warned Jules , " Too many luxuries will sink the boat . " " What luxuries ? " The Frenchman sounded puzzled . " Surely , a decent galley and wine cellar are obvious necessities . " Suddenly the tow line slackened , and the David turned around , chugging back toward him . As the tiny torpedo boat approached , its commander called out , " Did you see her ? " " See who ? " Beau had seen nothing but sea and sky . Pointing back toward Sand Island , the ensign replied , " Federal ironclad , lying up in the lee of those dunes . " " Are you sure ? " Beau had seen nothing , but he was looking out to sea . " You can see haze from her stacks , coming from behind that big dune . " Sure enough , Beau saw a shimmering column of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting at anchor , within a mile or two at most . And they too might see the heat coming from the David 's folding smoke stack . There was no chance of the torpedo boat making a daylight attack with its spar torpedo , so Beau told him to cast off . " Wait for us here . We will need a tow to get home . " Without a crew to turn the crank , Memphis could not maneuver for long , and lacked the power to pull a torpedo , but they could make a test attack . By using the idling propeller to drive the motor-generator during the tow , they had fully charged the batteries . Beau called down to Jules , " Enemy in sight . " " Who is that ? " Not actually being at war , the Frenchman was somewhat at a loss . " Union ironclad , in the lee of Sand Island . " Though Beau had only seen a thin bit of haze . " Got to get a closer look . " Leaving the David waiting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leeward side of the dunes , hugging the shallows . Sure enough , as he rounded the tip of Sand Island , he saw a deck canopy , then a gun turret emerge , followed by a tall funnel , then another turret . Beau called down to Jules , " She 's there . Chickasaw class , twin turrets , and shallow draught , lying a mile or so northwest of West Sand Island . " " Let me see , " Jules pleaded . Few Europeans had seen the U.S. Navy 's new turreted ironclads . Like the Memphis , the Chickasaw class were ships of the future , with no masts or portholes , fought with their metal decks nearly awash , showing only smoke stacks and armored turrets to the enemy . Sailors living below the ironclad 's waterline , seeing by lamplight and breathing through ventilators , might as well be inside a submarine . Beau took pity on the novelist , squatting down so Jules could squirm up for a look . " Do n't have an attack . " Jules Verne stuck his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those gun muzzles look a foot across . " " Eleven inches , " Beau informed him . " And there are four of them . " No Confederate ship had even one gun that big . Tennessee with her seven-inch rifles was no longer the mightiest ship on the Gulf . But Memphis could beat all these metal monsters , and Beau meant to prove it . Ordering Jules below , he prepared to make a mock attack , pulling the torpedo release , then shutting the hatch . Bosun stood ready at the hydroplanes ; no one offered him a peek at the U.S. Navy . Lining up the ironclad in his periscope , Beau calculated distances . Hunley had sunk the Housatonic with a spar torpedo , but the blast had destroyed the submarine as well . Beau preferred a towed torpedo , so when the submarine passed under the enemy ship , the torpedo would hit the on the far side of the foe 's hull , well behind the submarine - giving Memphis an even chance of surviving her own attack . Submarine service was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo , Beau had substituted a buoy studded with percussion fuses , and fifty yards of light line . As soon as he dived , the buoy would float free , and the line would unreel . Or so Beau hoped . He crept toward the ironclad , running the engine at half power , with just the snorkel and periscope exposed . Men were moving about on the metal deck , but there was small chance he would be spotted . Lookouts were searching the ship channel , unworried by underwater attack . When the sailors were clearly visible , Beau blew more ballast and dived , not wanting to see the expressions on men he might be drowning tomorrow . The whole point of this exercise was to prove he could kill them . As water rose up to cover their faces , he told Bosun , " Level off at three fathoms . " Bosun kept his gaze fixed on the water level in the depth indicator , calling out the depth riverboat fashion , " Ten feet . Quarter-less-twain . Mark twain .... " That meant twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven or so . One more fathom , and they could pass cleanly under the metal monster 's keel . Bosun continued his call , " And a quarter twain . Half twain . Quarter-less-three . Three even . " Bosun leveled off , and Beau held his breath . Minutes ticked by as Beau stuck to his compass heading , trying to make his pass directly amidships , with the booby-trapped buoy trailing hard behind him . Suddenly Beau felt a shudder , and the hiss of sand under the keel . " What was that ? " Jules seemed about to have another attack . " We 've touched bottom . " Beau called out to Bosun , " Up hydroplanes . " Bosun obeyed , calmly reading out the depth , " Quarter-less-three . Half twain .... " " Level off at a quarter twain . " By Beau 's calculations they should be right under the ironclad . He had a horrid picture of them duplicating the Hunley 's feat ; accidentally ramming the Yankees , then having the enemy sink on top of them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body into keeping the submarine level . But the boat kept rising . " Mark twain . Quarter-less-twain .... " Beau tensed for impact , unable to blow air without sending the Memphis back to the bottom . Gripping the ballast valves , he listened helplessly for the first crunch of contact . Instead he heard a muffled bang , followed by another one . Jules looked up at him , his white face starting to twitch . " What were those ? " " We did it ! " Beau could barely believe it . " We hit ! " " Hit bottom ? " That hardly seemed possible , since they had been headed up . " No , we scored a hit on the ironclad . " Beau had gotten the course right , but badly misjudged the distance . " Those bangs were the buoy 's percussion fuses exploding . " Jules looked at him in astonished relief , while Bosun slowly intoned , " By the quarter twain . " They had leveled off again . Gingerly , Beau made sure the exhaust valves were shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Up hydroplanes . I am going to surface . " As soon as light streamed in the ports , Beau popped the hatch and looked out . By now the twin-turreted ironclad was nearly a hundred yards away , and showing no sign of distress . No one was searching the water , or looking his way . Heaven knows what the sailors made of percussion fuses bursting against their hull . Reeling in the buoy , Beau found that two of the fuses had indeed blown ; all he needed was to attach them to explosives . Asked if he had any runaways , my husband roared , " Never ! It 's pretty hard to keep me from running away from them . " He loudly proclaimed that his slaves should all go to the Yankees and stop living off him . - Mary Chesnut MEMPHIS BLUES , AGAIN ADMIRAL FRANKLIN BUCHANAN met Beau at the dock , along with Brigadier Page and most of the masters and commanders . Admiral Buchanan was the one man who knew how Beau felt , having commanded the first Confederate ironclad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day , when Virginia had sunk the Cumberland and set the Congress ablaze , Buchanan must have felt like he had broken the South 's chains . He had been the Confederacy 's first free captain , able to steam where he would , without fearing the U.S. Navy . Wounded , Buchanan turned over his command in triumph , only to have his victory taken away the very next day by the first Federal ironclad . Now Beau had the cure for ironclads in his hand , triumphantly showing Buchanan the buoy with its pair of blown fuses . Had either been attached to a barrel of gunpowder , nothing could have saved the metal monster . Whatever doubts Admiral Buchanan might have about Beau 's claims were tempered by the certain knowledge that a Chickasaw-class ironclad was moored in the lee of Sand Island . If Beau could not sink her , Tennessee would have to take her on , facing many times her weight of metal , with bad engines and worse steering .

" Not a real Yankee , maybe . " Bennett backed off slyly . " Jes " a Yankee spy . " " What Yankee spy ? " Beau had been kissing only one person lately . " Emma de Pralines . " Bennett was keen to see how he took the news . " Or should I say Dousinelle . " " Dousinelle ? " Jules stepped up , equally perplexed . " That is her name . " Murphy of the Selma seconded Bennet . " She is no de Pralines , not even from Awlins at all . Her name is Emma Dousinelle , of Montreal . " Montreal ? Beau realized where he had heard Emma 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acadian , but something closer to French Canadian . Even as pieces fell into place he protested , " It 's not possible . " Bennett added gleefully . " And that fat Texan too . " " He can not be Canadian . " Beau refused to believe that , since the honorable Maria Spinoza had been pure Texacan , able to pronounce " Popocatepetl " like an Aztec . " Maybe not , " Bennett admitted , " but he was a spy for the Yankees . Upriver troops recognized him as one of the men who burnt the camels at the Dog River bar . When that would not stop the Tennessee , Spinoza followed her here . He broke free from the men who grabbed him .... " " Acting godawful spry for such a big man , " Murphy noted . Bennett agreed .

" " A married Frenchman , " Beau reminded the adventure writer . Chivalry would have died out ages ago , if it were confined to bachelors . " Too true . " Jules could not pretend disinterest . " Still , I am here to pursue submarines - not beautiful American spies . Let me see that the Memphis does not come to mischief , while you deal with any and all damsels in distress . " Fair enough .

Of course Beau had already told Emma everything he knew about submarines , but he had sense enough not to say so to his superiors , pretending he was as mystified as they . Fairly easy , given the circumstances . He found Emma behind bars in a brick cell , illuminated by an oil lamp and a barred window . She was wearing the same white gown she had worn that morning , and when she saw him , she smiled the same smile . Beau found it terribly unreal , having cold iron bars between them while Emma was confined to this little cheerless room . He asked , " How is this possible ? " Emma shrugged prettily , as if to say it was not her choice either . " Spinoza knew Jujitsu , and I do not . He used to be a carnival wrestler , a rather good one , it seems . " And a clever liar as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be in congress , it never occurred to him that Spinoza lied about that too . But that was not the deception that hurt . Beau whispered reproachfully , " You lied to me . " " Not about anything important , " Emma protested coyly , coming up to the bars , so their hands could touch . " Certainly not about liking you . " Or about having a passionate interest in submarines . " You lied about being Emma de Pralines . " " That was no lie . " Emma looked appalled at the suggestion . " Any lady is allowed to employ polite deceptions , and protect her identity when armed ruffians have her under duress . " Her pretenses could be incredible . Beau had squandered his pay on wining , dining , and carriage rides , and gotten only a dockside kiss from a suspected spy . Luckily , he was used to being laughed at . " What ruffians ? " he demanded . " What duress ? " Emma rattled the barred door of her cell . " This duress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ruffians armed with submarine torpedoes , who are in rebellion against their own elected government . " " Only because you are spying for the Yankees . " " If there were no secrets , there would be no spies , " Emma replied tartly . " I am not spying for the Yankees . I am Canadian , and we have beaten back our fair share of Yankee invasions . And do you know how ? " Beau sighed . " I am sure you will tell me . " " Because we all fought together , red , white , and black , British and French , Acadians and Chippewa , Canadians and foreign born , all joining together to keep out those pesky Americans . " Emma smirked at what passed for Canadian nationalism . " Lord knows we hate each other , but we hate the Yankees more . " " If you hate us so much , what brought you here ? " They were standing as close as when they kissed on the dock , with only the bars between them . Emma laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated Yankees . Not fine strapping Southern ruffians like yourself . " " Really ? " Despite all that had happened , Beau still wanted her more than ever in some ways . " Absolument . " She squeezed his hand warmly . " Everything I told you is true . My affection for you , and for the South . I said I would do " anything " for Southern freedom , and I think this pretty much qualifies . " He kissed the slim fingers lying atop his . " Do Canadians always love their enemies so ? " " You are not my enemy . " Emma squeezed his hand again . " You Americans are the ones fighting a civil war . I am completely unconflicted , caring only for freedom , which knows no boundaries , not even national ones . I came here for Bosun 's freedom , and yours . " " For mine ? " Beau was on the unbricked side of the bars . " Anyone who keeps a slave can never really be free . " Emma kissed his hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " They were a long way from Canada . " You might as well ask why I breathe . My parents ran a station on the underground railroad , so I was raised to help people find freedom . Why should I not help you ? " " Because it is insanely risky . " Leaning in , he kissed her on the lips . Emma kissed back , giving herself as completely as her jail cell allowed . Which kept them from discussing submarine navigation , or Admiral Farragut 's plans , as they discovered how best to kiss between the bars . Before he knew it , the time Beau had begged was up . And he had thought Emma de Pralines was forward . Beau could honestly tell his superiors that Emma Dousinelle posed no threat , and had not compromised his plans to assault the ironclad , since she was in custody before he made them . " And I much doubt that she could have signaled anything of value to Farragut . " It seemed utterly foolish to he holding her at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma . As he left Fort Morgan , Mama Love was being admitted , with a basket of things for her mistress . While the guards inspected her basket , Mama Love gave Beau an approving smile . Beau smiled back , knowing that whatever Mama Love was bringing to Emma would hardly be in that basket . Slaves had a lifetime of experience at keeping secrets from their masters , and even a torture rack would not get anything out of Mama Love that she did not want to tell . Since no one wanted Beau 's advice , he was content to watch the Hoodoo woman pass easily between the heavy sloping ramparts and thick brick walls of Fort Morgan . Somewhere beneath that brickwork , Emma sat in a barred cell , which Beau found both sad and stupid . How was she going to harm the South ? Farragut 's fleet was what they had to fear , not pretty Canadians . Finding out Emma was a Yankee sympathizer did not upset Beau as much as he might have thought . Hell , some of Beau 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had served under Farragut , and liked the old man , who was technically from Tennessee but bled Navy blue . Bosun was a slave , which did not make him a Yankee either , though it certainly made him a sympathizer . Bosun was just too polite to show it - much . Beau was not among those massahs deluded enough to think slaves liked being property . Discovering Emma was a Yankee spy made her suddenly accessible . Emma de Pralines had been an impossible ideal twirling a white parasol , a walking emblem of Southern womanhood , all done up in satin ribbons - and likely trailing a dozen infatuated beaus , each able to buy and sell a stranded naval officer . What chance did he really have with her ? Emma Dousinelle was a flesh-and-blood woman , warm and willing , and infernally contrary , who boldly put her body behind her words . And a woman who needed Beau far more than Emma de Pralines ever could ; though Emma never suggested he help her escape or intervene in any way , only asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment that he would get much farther with Emma Dousinelle - if he could somehow get her out of jail . Jules came out to greet him when he got back to the Memphis , saying excitedly , " Your crew has arrived . " " My crew ? " Beau saw no one at the dock but a couple of sentries , some stevedores unloading smuggled coal , and a half dozen slaves sitting around a fire , brewing chicory . Jules Verne cocked his head toward the slaves by the fire . " They , arrived less than an hour ago , saying they had come to turn the crank on the Memphis . " Beau called for Bosun , asking if he had talked to the new men . Bosun nodded . " They are all river men , firemen , deckhands , and the like . They say they belong to the de Pralines . " " Do you believe them ? " Beau had neglected to ask Emma how much of her story was made up . Bosun shrugged . " I only know one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His name is Amos , and he fired the middle door on the ol " Natchez , back befo " the war . Someone owned him then , and it could have been the de Pralines . " Quizzing these men was next to impossible , since the whole elaborate system to detect runaways , or slaves posing as free , broke down when slaves claimed to be someone 's property , especially someone rich and respected . If they did not belong to the de Pralines , it was up to their masters to say so . Beau asked , " What plantation are they from ? " " Some place up in Mississippi , " Bosun replied , " but they hate it , because it 's far from the river , and they do not like growin " hogs and cotton . They want to be tootin " downriver on a first class steamer , sneaking saloon liquor , an " gettin " fat off the grub pile . " Who would not ? War was hard on everyone , even the slaves it was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided . " And see if we can get them something better to eat than chicory coffee . " Jules laughed , saying , " Where do you think they got the chicory ? " Suddenly the submarine service was having to feed people . Slaves no less . Beau foresaw difficulties with the commissary . " I 'll see about drawing a peck and a pint for each of them . " Slave rations were a peck of corn and a pint of salt . " Until then , give them what we got . " Jules produced some garlic , rice , beans , raisins , pepper , and cooking wine from his personal stores , cheering up the river men , who already favored poor man 's French cuisine . Beau had to find out who these so-called slaves belonged to - if anyone - and what their role in this was , beyond cadging a free meal . Having them show up the day before his planned attack on the ironclad was just too pat . all that kissing between the bars kept him from asking important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what they could expect next . What came next was the infantry . A lieutenant and sergeant strode up the dock , saying Beau 's presence was requested immediately at Fort Morgan - that and nothing more . Plainly it was important , but if they wanted him to ask questions , they would not have sent the army . Beau made the best of it , offering them some chicory , and telling Jules to see to the slaves . " Above all , do not let them on board the boat . " " Absolument , " Jules agreed . Both of them were determined that no harm should come to the Memphis . The Tennessee and the submarine were the two most likely targets of any Yankee plot . Back at Fort Morgan , Beau was jointly interviewed by Brigadier Page and Commander Johnston of the Tennessee . Johnson led off , saying , " We must know everything that passed between you and the prisoner , Emma Dousinelle . " Luckily Beau had just gone over this set of lies , and only had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten no information out of Emma because the girl plainly did not know anything . " Miss Dousinelle was most likely an unwitting accomplice to his man Spinoza . " " But did anything physical pass between you ? " Brigadier Page demanded . Nothing but saliva , though Beau did not say so . " Physical ? You mean like a message , or memento ? No , nothing of the sort . " Commander Johnston shook his head . " We mean , like a key to the cell . Emma Dousinelle has escaped . " Beau 's heart leapt . No wonder Emma had not begged his aid . Struggling to hide his glee , he gave in to genuine astonishment . " Escaped ? How could that happen ? " " We were hoping you might tell us , " Page replied dryly . Beau could honestly say he had no idea . " Were the bars cut ? Was the door unlocked ? " " Neither , " replied Page . " Miss Dousinelle apparently disappeared from her locked cell , not long after seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securely locked away ; something I protested mightily at the time . " Then the answer hit him . " What about Mama Love ? " " Mama who ? " Page was obviously new to the Hoodoo . " Her maidservant , a tall Negress , who came in as I left . " Beau remembered the Hoodoo woman 's slim smile as her basket was searched . " There was nothing in that slave woman 's basket , " Page insisted , " and Emma Dousinelle was in her cell when the Negress left . " Nonetheless , that was how Emma had escaped . It might be as simple as a lock pick and disguise , or gold to bribe the guard , but Beau bet on the Hoodoo . Women like Mama Love could make men see what they wanted to see , instead of what was there . Getting a slim pretty woman out of a locked cell , in a fort full of men , was nothing compared to calling spirits and making the dead walk , both of which Beau had seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He merely said , " Find Mama Love , and you will most likely find Emma too . " Unless Beau found her first . When he got back to the dock , he found the sentries and stevedores gone , and the slaves lounging about their fire . Sitting out in the bay about fifty yards away was the Morgan , under Commander George Harrison , a sidewheel gun-boat with a seven-inch rifle at either end . Admiral Buchanan had brought the Morgan in close to keep watch on the Memphis , fearing someone would seize the submarine and open her dive tanks . Jules and Bosun sat together on the dock , sharing a cup of hot chicory and a corncob pipe . Beau recognized the sweet , pungent smell of something stronger than tobacco . Jules grinned up at him , saying , " Bosun swears hemp is good for the nerves . " " What you got to be nervous about ? " With Emma gone , and a Yankee ironclad off Sand Island , all Beau needed was for his Frenchman to have another neuralgia attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pointed with the stem . " Go look inside the Memphis ; you 'll see . " Beau went at once to check the submarine , fearing to find her taking on water . But Memphis seemed fine , riding high in the still water , with her hatch open to let in air and light . Looking down , he saw no sign of a leak , but decided to check the bilges . Beau swung around , and swiftly descended the ladder , into the cool metal interior . At the bottom , he turned about , and saw at once what Jules meant . Emma sat on the lower rim of the hydroplane wheel , hunched forward , hands on her knees , her face turned to him . She wore a baggy homespun dress and a tattered kerchief about her neck , but looked as lovely as ever . True beauty shone through shabby clothes and dim lighting . Without wasting a word , they kissed , glorying in the freedom to feel , no longer separated by iron bars , or layers of lace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you doing here ? " " Waiting for you . " Emma sounded like that should have been obvious . " That is wonderful , but .... " Also wildly impractical . How could he hope to hide her , with infantry combing the area , and a full dress naval inspection scheduled for the morning ? Admiral Buchanan was keeping a sharp watch on the Memphis , now that Federal spies were after her . Emma pulled him closer . " I want you to come with me . " Beau liked the contact , wondered where it was headed . " Where to ? " " To freedom . " Emma kissed him again , harder than ever . He returned the favor , first on her lips , then on the curve of her throat . There Beau noted , " You have black paint behind your ear . " Emma did not bother wiping it off , asking instead , " So are you coming with me ? " By now he very much wanted to go , more than he wanted to face a Chickasaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not trust . " How are you hoping to get to freedom ? " " By submarine , silly . " Emma 's smile widened . " That 's the exciting part . " And Beau thought this was the exciting part . " You are mad as usual . How do you hope to pilot this submarine ? " " Jules will help , " Emma declared . " And Bosun too . " " They will ? " Beau let go of Emma , and hoisted himself up , until he sat on the edge of the hatch , asking the Frenchman on the dock , " Is this so ? " " Alas , yes . " Jules seemed embarrassed by his deception . " I vowed not to take sides , but France abolished slavery in 1789 . I could not let the greed of a few cotton financiers bring shame on my country . " Beau turned to Bosun . " Et tu , Brute ? " Bosun rose , grinned , and snapped off a regulation salute . " Sergeant Nehemiah Lee , Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisbie commanding - on detached service . " " And these gentlemen ? " Beau indicated the slaves by the fire , finishing off the last of Jules 's rice . They also rose , and saluted with a smirk , their leader saying , " Corporal Amos Jones , Corps d'Afrique , at your service . " Uncle Sam was plainly their master , not the de Pralines ; a squad of Yankee infantry had penetrated the Mobile defenses , and Beau was the only one who knew , aside from a French novelist and a fetching Canadian spy . He asked Bosun , " So , am I your prisoner ? " " Only if you want to be . " That came from Emma , sliding up to join him , aiming to be as persuasive as she could . Beau found himself surrounded , though there was not a real Yankee in the crowd . He had long ago come to terms with losing the war . Memphis had been one last shot at breaking the blockade , but she was now in Union hands . Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give up on Emma and Memphis . " If you are going , I am going . " " Good . " Emma gave him a swift kiss , then they scrambled out of the way , and the Corps d'Afrique filed into the submarine , followed by Bosun and Jules . Emma was small enough to sit beside Beau in the conning station , ready to work the valves and switches , just like she said . He pulled easily away from the dock under electric power , heading out into the bay . George Harrison hailed him from the Morgan . " Beau , where you headed ? " Lacking the heart to invent some lie , Beau closed the hatch and told Bosun to dive . " Blowing dive tanks , level off at half a fathom . " Hoping to see through the periscope , he frantically adjusted the trim tanks , and was rewarded with a blurry image of the empty bay ahead . At least he need not fear hitting anything big . Seeing no sense in running down the batteries , he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the crank . " Bosun passed on the order , then added , " You can call me Bosun . I never liked Nehemiah , and Lee is my old massah 's name . " Eugene Beauregard understood , happy he did not have to wrap his tongue around " Nehemiah . " " But I will be calling you Beau now , " Bosun warned . Beau nodded . " Just so it is not Eugene . " As the crank began to turn , the sub surged ahead , and Emma adjusted the electrical system , reversing the motor to recharge the batteries . From deep in the belly of the Memphis , behind the rear pressure door , came a low strong chant , swelling as the crank turned faster : No mo " auction block for me , No mo ' , no mo ' , No mo " auction block for me . Which was answered by an even deeper chorus , from the men in the forward section : Many thousands gone . Many thousands gone . So strong was the chant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosun had to back off the hydroplanes to keep them from bursting out of the bay , surfacing through sheer enthusiasm . Propelled by the Corps d'Afrique , they plowed along , just beneath the surface , showing nothing but the foam V made by the periscope , and the ball-valve snorkel . Slowly the cold , clammy submarine grew hot and stuffy . Too many people were breathing in a confined space , through a slim tube . By the time they reached the main channel , Beau decided to surface and get his bearings , figuring he had left George Harrison far enough behind . Blowing out the dive tanks , Beau surfaced , and flung open the hatch , letting fresh air into the submarine . he had reached the main channel , and to starboard black flags marking the moored torpedoes fluttered between him and Sand Island . One of the Davids was making for the signal station near the line of piles west of the channel . Looking aft , Beau got the surprise of his life , finding young George Harrison was not the fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan , working up a full head of steam . Only the enthusiasm of the Corps d'Afrique had kept them well ahead of the oncoming steamer . But not for long . No matter how hard the men cranked , the steamer would soon he on them , and Memphis had no torpedo to drag in her wake , no weapons of any kind , unless the Africa Corps had smuggled some aboard . Beau never carried a sidearm , and Emma and Jules were nonviolent by nature . Morgan was bulging with cannon , ridiculously overarmed for a small passenger steamer , and behind her , Bennett was getting up steam in the Gaines . " What do you see ? " Emma demanded , practically in his lap , but unable to look out the hatch . " Boatloads of trouble , " he told her . " Switch to electric power , and prepare to dive . " Emma repeated his commands to the men below , at the same time busily flipping switches and adjusting the trim tanks . Like she promised , Ernma was his extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He plotted a mental course for the east side of Sand Island , planning to just shave the moored torpedoes , keeping as clear as he could of Fort Morgan , and the ships moored behind Mobile Point . When his mental course was set , he closed the hatch and gave the order to dive . As they descended , Emma asked softly , " What is happening ? " " Two gunboats are giving chase . " He spoke loudly so everyone could hear . " We have to inch out of the channel under electrical power , staying down as long as we can , and using as little air as possible . " No cranking , no singing , and no nerve attacks - then they just might make it . Memphis fell silent as Bosun leveled off at two fathoms , and Beau tried to steer a compass course through the strong channel current . Tide was headed out , which helped some . For a while Beau heard only labored breathing aboard the submarine , then he made out a more distant rattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " What is that ? " " Paddle wheel , " Bosun replied , like there was no other possibility . He called to the men in the rear compartment , which was thrown open for ventilation . " Sounds like a side wheeler . What would you say , Corporal Amos ? " Amos listened , then answered , " Would say it was the Morgan . Wi " that loose linkage , she whines like a windmill . " " Sure ai n't the Selma , " Bosun agreed . " Selma runs real sweet . " Beau had heard river men name off boats in the dark , just by the sound of their engines . Hearing it done underwater was a new twist . As the steamer drew closer , Beau could make out the slap of paddles hitting the bay above . Unnervingly loud , but futile at the same time . So long as the submariners slid along , saving their breath , the whole Confederate navy could not stop them . Jules observed smugly , " We hear them , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , giving a whole new meaning to blind man 's bluff . Sweat trickled down Beau 's uniform collar as he listened to Morgan 's paddle wheel beat nearer , then pass overhead , and finally recede as the gunboat went thrashing off down the ship channel . Ironic cheers for the Confederate navy echoed through the submarine . Beau saved his breath . It was already getting stuffy again , and he was no longer so sure of his direction . He could not hear the Morgan 's paddle wheels , which might mean the gunboat was heading out to sea , or that Memphis had strayed from the ship channel . There were treacherous shoals east of the channel , and on the approaches to Sand Island . He whispered to Emma , " I want to take us up for a quick look , and some fresh air . " She whispered back , " Is it safe ? " " No , but we have to breathe . " And see where they were going . Beau crept back to the surface , and swung open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And found the Morgan waiting for him , sitting just down the channel with her paddle wheels idled , covering the narrow gap between Fort Morgan and the moored torpedoes , seeing if the submarine would resurface . And they had , with the gunboat smack in their path . While Beau wondered what to do next , a bullet whizzed past his shoulder , hitting the water about ten yards away . He turned to see the David chugging toward them , while a man in the open hatchway worked the lever on a repeating carbine . Beyond the David , Bennett was bringing the Gaines down the channel toward them , boxing Memphis in still further . Another shot whistled by his head . he could not stay here , and his pursuers expected Memphis to run down the channel to the open sea . Dropping down , he shut the hatch , hearing a hullet ping off the metal . This made it perfect ; both navies , North and South , were now out to get him . He turned to Emma , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a fathom , and be ready to recharge batteries . " " What 's that pinging ? " Jules demanded , unduly alarmed . " Some fool firing at us with a Yankee carbine , " Beau complained . He called down to Bosun , " Half a fathom . " Beau put the helm through a half circle , thinking of the spar torpedo on the prow of that David . He had only one sure way to escape , though he hated to take it . " Full speed on the crank . We have to go under the torpedoes . " " Why in the world ? " asked Jules anxiously . " It is the one place they will not follow us . " No one disputed Beau 's reasoning , because it was the one place none of them wanted to go - but by now they knew that any hesitation was literally a waste of breath . Hard strong hands turned the crank , and deep voices echoed through the Memphis , singing to a rising tempo that drove the crank even faster : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mo ' , no mo ' , No mo " driver 's lash for me . And the chorus from the forward cabin got faster as well : Many thousands gone . Many thousands gone . By now Beau knew the war had gone on way too long , and did not need the Ninety-second U.S. Colored Troops to tell him many thousands had died . Every man that went down in the Hunley with him had died , and so had half his friends and relations outside the submarine service . From Mobile to Richmond , Southerners were mostly fighting to stay alive , and gallant saber charges had given way to cowering in trenches and bombproofs . Raids into Ohio had brought even worse news ; it seemed that only the South was fighting this war . Confederate raiders reported that Ohio was a country at peace , full of people working prosperous farms , who wore good shoes and store-bought clothes , and ate meat for dinner . Southern farms were run by women and slaves , but Ohio was full of farmers and local militia , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have known the Union had a million men under arms - yet Northern Democrats kept whining that the war was too " costly , " as if the South were not even worth conquering . At least the Republicans did not pretend to like you . Such insufferable arrogance made you want to blow up a U.S. Navy ironclad , just to wipe the smug smile off their well-fed faces . Even Beau might be tempted to throw himself away just to teach Washington a lesson , but he would not throw away Emma - that would be just plain stupid . Through his blurry periscope he could see the fluttering picket flags marking the moored torpedoes . Most of the torpedoes were moored at less than two fathoms , to eatch shallow-draft ironclads , and the Memphis should be able to pass beneath them . But torpedo depths were haphazard at best - moorings shifted , and torpedoes broke loose , or sank below their proper depth-while Beau would be running blind . If folks were not shooting at him , he never would have had the nerve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Switch to electric power . Blowing ballast . Bosun , take her down . " Emma got the motor going , while Bosun called out the depth , " One an " half , quarter-less-twain , twain .... " Beau doubted there were any mines moored below two fathoms , but he meant to go as deep as he could , just in case . " Quarter twain , half twain , quarter-less-three .... " " Level off at a half three . " With twenty feet of water overhead , Beau felt tolerably safe . Until a horrid clang came from up forward , followed by a shudder of contact , and a scraping sound that came toward him , sending shivers down Beau 's spine . He called out , " Torpedo cable . " No one said a word in reply . Emma merely squeezed his hand . " Down more , " Beau ordered , at the same time applying port helm , trying to keep the cable from fouling the hydroplanes , or worse yet , the propeller . he pictured the Memphis pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded as though he were giving the time of day . Suddenly the scraping stopped . Beau held his breath , backing off the helm , listening intently . All he heard was shallow breathing aboard the Memphis . Bosun called out , " Four even . " " Level off . " Beau did not want to hit bottom again . Another shiver went through the ship , followed by more scraping as the prow hit a second cable . Beau put the helm to port again , softly saying to Bosun , " Keep her level . " " Four even , " Bosun intoned , careful not to fight the cable . Emma 's hands left the trim valves , and her arms circled Beau 's waist , pulling them closer together . If even one of the torpedoes overhead went off , the Mobile channel would come crashing in on them , crushing Memphis like an empty egg shell . She whispered in his ear , " Do not worry . Mama Love is watching over us . " Beau hoped so . Mama Love had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so seeing them through a submerged maze of moored torpedoes should be a breeze . He glanced at his watch , trying to gauge speed and distance . Emma whispered , " How long ? " " Two more minutes , " Beau estimated . " Two minutes and we are safe . " Emma started to speak , but Beau kissed her instead , mindful of the need to preserve air . He continued preserving air well past the two minutes . There were no more cables , and no explosion . No wall of water rushed in to drown them . Which meant Beau had to go back to steering . <p> Sitting alongside Sand Island was the ironclad , with hatches open and wash hanging from the awning lines . It said a lot for Yankee overconfidence that Beau got within hailing distance without anyone seeing him . He sang out , " Ahoy , this is the Confederate submarine Memphis , wishing to surrender . " That brought heads up to hatches , and sailors spilled out of the turrets , surprised to see half a Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was close alongside , the ironclad 's commander was at the midships rail , as curious as anyone . Suddenly , the Yankee commander 's face brightened , and he called out , " Beau ! Beauregard Fontenot ! Hello , Beau , do n't you know me ? It 's Tom Stevens . " And it was . Beau recognized him from the Brooklyn . Tom had been many years his junior on the lieutenant 's list , and now he commanded an ironclad . War had been pretty good to the U.S. Navy . Beau bet that half the commanders in Farragut 's fleet were men he knew from the " little " prewar Navy . He waved and shouted back , " ' Course I do , Tom . I would not surrender my submarine to anyone but you . " " That 's awfully nice , Beau . " All Tom could see of the Memphis was .. the open hatchway , with the attached periscope and snorkel , but he must have heard about the submarine in Mobile Bay . Yankee intelligence was much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ice water ? " " Sure thing . " Beau was a hot , sweaty mess , but he meant to do things right . " I must see my crew off first . " Starting with Emma . He ducked down , gave Emma a swift kiss , then helped her slip past him , into the air and light . Handing her up to a couple of eager sailors , he told the Yankees , " This is Emma Dousinelle , a Canadian citizen , in the employ of your government . " " Always delighted to meet another public servant . " Commander Tom doffed his cap . " Welcome to the Winnebago . " Bosun was a tighter squeeze , but he also made it past Beau , and was welcomed aboard the Winnebago . Then Beau retreated to the hydroplane station , allowing the rest of the squad from the Ninety-second U.S.C.T. , Corps d'Afrique , to emerge from submerged Memphis like men in a magic act . Soon they were all downing ice water on the iron deck . With Jules 's help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dogged the submarine 's hatch . Then he went aboard the Winnebago to get his ice water . There Beau introduced his foreign advisor , saying , " Tom , this is Jules Verne , the French novelist . And a neutral party . " " Not entirely , " Jules confessed . " I was privately contacted by Charles Francis Adams , the American ambassador to England , and asked to discover if the Memphis was meant for the Confederacy . I fear that in my enthusiasm , I have exceeded my commission .... " " No one blames you . " Tom shook the Frenchman 's hand . " You have struck a timely blow for freedom . " " And redeemed the honor of France , " Jules added , glancing wistfully back at the Memphis - now knowing all there was to know about submarines . Beau alone felt at a loss , being the only one on the losing side . He was at worst a prisoner of war , and at best a traitor to the South , however much : he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma was ringed by attentive naval officers , and Jules was basking in Commander Tom 's congratulations . Beau found himself cooling his heels with the Corps d'Afrique , ex-slaves , and an ex-Confederate , wondering what to make of this brave new world . With no more slaves and masters , they were all going to have to find real jobs . He asked Bosun , " Was I a bad master ? " Bosun looked at him like he was crazy . " Hell , no ! You were first rate . There are some stupid-mean crackers that should never be allowed to own aman . " " Glad to hear I am not one of them . " Bad enough to be a slave owner , without being a cruel idiot as well . " Buck up , massah . " Bosun slapped him on the back . " You gon na ? enjoy being free . "
