<p> NEW YORK  --  On a typical Saturday night in a Manhattan bar , women sip candy-colored cocktails , maraschino cherries bobbing on the surface . Men recline on banquettes , arms slinking along the vinyl toward their dates ' shoulders . The abundance of cleavage is as noticeable as the absence of wedding bands . <p> But then a bell rings and the couples break up , scurrying off to other tables in search of their new partners . <p> Eight minutes later  --  ding ! They shuffle again in a motion that is part musical bar stools , part blind-dating game . The four dozen men and women are each going out on eight 8-minute dates tonight at about $ 4 an ogle . The singles rate their dates using pen and paper and if  --  ding , ding  --  they discover two days later via e-mail that they 've made a match or two ( or three )  --  well , do the math . <p> Paul Raman already has . " It 's cost-effective , " explains the bespectacled Raman , 37 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 80 miles away . " You can hit about 20 birds with one shot . " ( That 's including the free-for-all mingling period during intermission . ) <p> Do the math another way  --  eight dates multiplied by 8 minutes equals 64 heart-fluttering minutes  --  and it " gives a whole new meaning to happy hour , " says Christan Marashio , tonight 's bell ringer and the event and promotion manager of 8minuteDating in Manhattan . <p> It 's this logic that 's luring those looking for love to speed dating , the latest offshoot of a run-catch-kiss culture . Schedules crammed with yoga classes and therapist appointments leave little room for a leisurely lunch  --  let alone dinner  --  with an unsure thing . Coffee break meet-and-greets are now the norm . <p> With the current crop of singles , " there is this sense of urgency , " says Maria Peevey , co-author of Are You My Boyfriend ? " There 's the issue of ' I do n't want to waste my time if he 's not the right one . ' " <p> Groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or so tables of eight singles rotate during a three-course meal to better the odds of meeting a special someone . There was even a grass-roots attempt by a group of New York singles to shoehorn in scoping opportunities during the rush-hour commute by designating certain subway cars matchmaking-mobiles . <p> But it 's really speed dating  --  3 to 10 minutes of flirtatious interrogation between strangers  --  that has tugged the national heartstrings . SpeedDating was started in Los Angeles in 1998 by Aish HaTorah , a Jewish educational network , as a matchmaking method for Jewish singles . <p> The concept has since bloomed into a half-dozen major companies staging snappy love connections from Omaha to Orlando in bars , restaurants , cafes and community centers , among straight and gay groups , as well as those targeted by age , race , religion or interest . Miranda sampled it on Sex and the City ; so did Sydney on Providence . <p> About 7,000 Jewish singles SpeedDated in 14 cities last year . Since 8minuteDating started in Boston in early 2001 , the company has grown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joneses ( and her suitors ) . A year and a half after launching in Chicago , FastDater has spread to 15 cities and 15,000 lonely hearts . New York-based HurryDate has expanded to 25 cities in the same time , ushering more than 18,000 singles through the system . <p> More prevalent in urban areas than the heartland , the phenomenon attracts a crowd mostly in their late 20s and 30s and largely professional  --  lawyers and finance types toiling in 60-hour workweeks , looking to settle down but lacking room on their PDAs to brave the standard bar scene . <p> Organizers boast that there 's a 50% to 70% chance the boy-meets-girl scenario will blossom into something beyond a few minutes of face time  --  an e-mail exchange at the very least . ( They 're operating on the honor system as to whether a participant is truly single . ) Still , marriages have ensued and babies have been born . <p> And as the holiday party circuit kicks in , this time of year is the busiest for places like FastDater , in which the partner-less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwestern cities . The company has developed the even thriftier Fast-Tag event for $ 25 a head : 500 lonely hearts post their pictures on a wall , next to an envelope , and wait for " I want to meet you " cards to drop in . <p> Patterning your dating strategy after a round-robin tennis tournament makes sense , " compared with the **27;0;TOOLONG kind of thing , " says Larry Young , 45 , a computer software professional who has journeyed to the 8minuteDating event from suburban Cortlandt Manor , N.Y . No matter that in the half-dozen times Young has tried the technique , he has met only one woman he saw more than once after the event . <p> And compared with online dating , " this is flirting boot camp , " says Adele Testani , co-founder and president of HurryDate . You do n't have time to craft ( or invent ) the perfect profile . " Then we blow the whistle and it 's time to move on . " Sometimes the would-be wooer hesitates . " Other times they ca n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry , 33 , knows that feeling . Last year he partook in his only Chicago FastDating experience . One date began : " OK , tell me all about your baggage . " Another started , " Well , I 'll tell you right now : I only like guys who are 6-foot-2 or taller . " Henry , a divorced architect , is 5-foot-8 . " We did n't say a word after that , " he says . <p> Then there was the woman in thigh-high black leather boots with " really , really , really " long fingernails painted silvery blue and a burning-heart tattoo ablaze on the right side of her chest . <p> " She asked me what my favorite position was , " Henry says . " Usually you wait more than three minutes to ask something like that  --  maybe 10,000 minutes . " <p> The other standout was Tanya Albert , the first woman he met and the one he 's still dating . It almost was n't meant to be : His initiale-mail wound up in her trash bin ( her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Albert just happened to check before it was automatically emptied . <p> Jenny Hust is equally fortunate that Cupid 's arrow was aimed accurately . She met her fiance in March during her first and last attempt at HurryDate in Atlanta . " I 've seen just about every type of jerk there is , " says Hust , 29 , who works in human resources . So " I had a strategy going in . " <p> She role-played with friends beforehand , deciding what would or would not sound stupid . She whittled her life story down to a minute and a half . She composed three queries , including , " Why did you and your ex-girlfriend split ? " <p> " I was sick of going on long dates with people I did n't like , " Hust says . After 29 mini-dates , she laid eyes on her last , Bryan Murray . He proposed five months later . <p> Michele Kelly can only hope to get that lucky . She 's eyeing the offerings at the 8minuteDating event at the Chetty Red bar downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as they 're nicely dressed , " says Kelly , 29 , a flame-haired Brooklyn pastry chef . It would also be nice if they did n't throw out the standard request : " Can you make me creme brulee ? " <p> Men in tweed jackets and blue button-downs mill about as if it 's the junior high dance . There 's a Yale professor , a biochemist and an **33;29;TOOLONG trader " and when do you usually meet that ? " marvels speed-dating first-timer Jonelle Bradshaw , 28 , a university administrator . <p> Kelly is another novice : " I feel like a virgin . " But four dates along , she 's buzzing about a nice stockbroker from Hoboken , N.J. , and a guy with shiny dark gelled hair and a black leather jacket to match . What does he do ? " We never got to that , " she says , giggling wildly . Plans have already hatched for him to mosey up to Midtown with her and her three girlfriends later on . <p> The method , and the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where " you go out on a bender and three days later , when you sober up , you 're in a relationship , " says Wellington native and Brooklyn resident Gavin Armstrong . Speed dating , on the other hand , is " completely over-the-top American . It 's like a menu board  --  so easy . " <p> His , er , order ? Three women . One " touched my leg a lot , " reports Armstrong , 31 , a musician and cable TV producer . Another desired date , Kelly , grabbed his arm . " She 's so happy and out of control . " <p> Beyond Armstrong 's earshot , Kelly is even more effusive . After a few minutes , " you just want to hug him , " she gushes . And he 's crowned by a thick brown mop of chin-length hair , remarkable in a room full of thirtysomething men . <p> Most of the group lingers at the bar once the two hours of official dates are up . Lights dim , ' 80s music comes on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , is undeterred by the lack of check marks on the score sheet where he makes his picks . " It 's a numbers game , like pulling the slots , " he says . " Sooner or later , you 'll hit the jackpot . Know what I mean ? "
