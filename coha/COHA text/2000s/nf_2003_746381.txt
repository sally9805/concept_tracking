I. Introduction <p> A recent case highlights immunities favoring the physical educator and school district in situations involving allegations of negligence behavior . In Jackson v. Unified School District 259(2000) , the Kansas Tort Claims Act ( KTCA ) was interpreted as providing immunity to preclude the plaintiff 's action for damages despite claims of negligence . This case raises the question as to whether the KTCA allows a reduced standard of care to injured students participating in required public school physical education and/or athletic programs , similar to the tort claims acts in South Carolina and Illinois . Based on this decision , one could argue that plaintiffs are not provided an equal protection of the laws . Specifically , it appears as if judicial interpretations are legitimizing a teacher ' s negligent actions and providing an undue insulation from liability when students are injured in physical education and/or athletic programs . <p> A recent case highlights immunities favoring the physical educator and school district in situations involving ordinary negligence . In Jackson v. Unified School District 259 ( 2000 ) , the Kansas Tort Claims Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaintiff 's action for damages . This case , however , raises the question as to whether the KTCA allows a reduced standard of care that physical educators must provide to students participating in required public school physical education and/or athletic programs . Although this article specifically addresses the Kansas Tort Claims Act , similar tort claims acts and interpretations exist in every state . <p> In Jackson v. USD 259 ( 2000 ) , a student enrolled in Hamilton Middle School in Wichita , KS , was inside the school gymnasium after the required physical education course activities had concluded . After asking his physical education teacher for permission , Jackson proceeded to place a large wooden springboard in front of the basketball goal with hopes of using the springboard to catapult in the air and either dunk the basketball and/or touch the rim of the basketball goal . In Jackson 's attempt to perform this endeavor , he fell . The fall caused compound fractures to bones in Jackson 's right forearm . Plaintiffs sued USD #259 for gross and wanton negligence . The school district filed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Based on K.S.A. 75-6104(o) , providing immunity for " recreational uses , " the district court granted the defendant 's summary judgment request . This decision was affirmed by the Kansas Court of Appeals . The Kansas Supreme Court subsequently overturned the Court of Appeals and reversed the district court decision . The case was remanded back to the trial court to further develop facts related to the intended or permitted use of the gymnasium , i.e. , whether the school gymnasium was encouraged , intended , or permitted to be used for other noncompulsory recreational activities in addition to its use for the required physical education program . The KTCA , passed in 1979 , holds a government entity responsible for negligent conduct if another private entity performing similar services would be liable . The Act was passed to modify and mollify the earlier concept of complete and absolute immunity , a concept adopted from England . Governmental immunity was meant to provide protection to the tax payer 's dollars and protect public coffers so that monies would be available to benefit society at large . Tax dollars would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefiting a number of people , for example , versus using the money to provide monetary recourse to one injured individual . Over time , this concept has changed . Now , in most all states , the government organization and its employees can be sued for wrongful acts unless the defendant can prove his or her actions were protected from liability under one of the state 's itemized exceptions to liability . The Jackson court of appeals reviewed the statutory interpretation of both the discretionary immunity ( KSA 75-6104(e) ) as well as the recreational use immunity exception to liability ( K.S.A. 75-6104 ( o ) ) . The Kansas Supreme Court 's opinion focused on the recreational use exception without discussion or elaboration on immunity for discretionary acts . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The courts have been left to interpret statutory meaning since the KTCA does not define many of the above terms including public property , playground , open area , or recreational purposes . <p> Cases like Jackson v. USD 259 ( 2000 ) should generate great debate on the appropriate legal standard of care legitimized by governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed to " encourage governmental entities to build recreational facilities for the benefit of the public without fear that they will be unable to fund them because of the high cost of litigation " ( Jackson v. USD #259 , 2000 ) . And , there is certainly merit to this purpose . Governmental immunities can protect taxpayer investments in the building and provision of parks , lakes , walking paths , hiking paths , and other green spaces for recreational activities . Society and the government both benefit , as land is available for recreational use that is healthy and therapeutic in nature . Ample research suggests the conclusion that both mental and physical benefits accrue from play and recreation . <p> However , in an era of teacher accountability , coupled with an effort to maintain the integrity of the law , is it prudent to legitimize such a low professional standard in physical education courses ? Do cases like Jackson v. USD #259 ( 2000 ) and the resultant legal outcomes merely provide slack in the professional standards individual educators set for themselves ? <p> There are six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appeals and/or Kansas Supreme Court . Each issue as interpreted by the courts immunizes the employee and school for their own ordinary acts of negligence . An important related issue focuses on whether this statutory immunity in turn lowers the standard of care that physical educators provide to the students . If the statute precludes individuals from suing the teachers and/or school district for negligence , is inadequate instruction and supervision being perpetuated without a fear or concern for liability ? Should physical educators be legally allowed to provide negligent instruction , in part , solely because the activities and lesson plans conducted occur in a recreational area ? The Jackson cases provide educational value and insight regarding the KTCA , in addition to various issues that serve as catalysts for discussion and thought . Although the case focuses on the Kansas statute , it is important to recognize that most state governmental immunity statutes use similar language . The following five issues considered by the courts are briefly elaborated on below . II . Jackson v. USD 259 ( 2000 ) : Statutory Interpretation A. Is an interior school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " as defined in K.S.A. 75-6104 ( o ) <p> Plaintiffs argue that use of the interior gymnasium fails to qualify as public property as stated in the statute since actual gymnasium use is " closed " to the public during school hours . For example , the public is not allowed to use the school gymnasium when classes are in session , when the gymnasium is used for other purposes ( i.e. , graduation ceremonies , pep rallies ) , or simply for use on a walk-in basis ( e.g. , pick- up basketball games ) . Both the Kansas court of appeals and supreme court conclude that the Hamilton Middle School gymnasium represented public property qualifying for protection under the KTCA . As succinctly stated by the court of appeals ( Jackson , 1999 ) . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> It is well accepted that public schools , including gymnasium facilities , do represent public property . B. Is an interior school gymnasium a " park . " " playground . " or " open area ? " <p> The plaintiffs argued that the terms , " park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligence occurring on outside recreational areas , not as in this case , an interior school gymnasium . This is the first case in Kansas to argue immunity for negligence occurring within the confines of a school gymnasium . The Kansas Supreme Court , however , refuted the plaintiff 's argument that a distinction exists between internal and external public property areas . As succinctly stated by the Court , " It defies common sense to hold that K.S.A. 75-6104(o) provides immunity from injuries which occur on a football field , a baseball field , a track and field area , and a sledding area , but not on an indoor basketball court solely because it is indoors . " Based on the lack of any legislative intent to limit the immunity to negligence occurring on outside spaces , the Kansas Supreme Court held that the interior school gymnasium does qualify as an " open area " as stated in K.S.A. 75-6104(o) . C. Does participation in a required physical education class during a school day qualify as a recreational activity as stated in K.S.A. 75-6104 ( o ) ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course does not represent activity for recreational purposes as stated in K.S.A. 75-6104(o) . As noted by an earlier Illinois appellate court , the terms do differ as recreation refers to " amusement , diversion , or enjoyment " while physical education refers to activities that " promote the development and care of the body using instruction . . . " . Attending a required physical education course as part of a compulsory education program does not equate , example , with a pick-up basketball game for purely recreational purposes . <p> Based on common law precedent , the Kansas Supreme Court explained that the injured party does not have to be engaged in a recreational activity per se to qualify for immunity under K.S.A. 75-6104(o) . Rather , the injury need only occur on land intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes . In other words , the individual 's specific use of the property at the time the injury occurs is irrelevant ( i.e. , an educational class versus a leisure , recreational activity ) . Emphasis focuses on whether the property could be , or has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the Jackson case ( 2000 ) , the Kansas Supreme Court remanded the case back to the district court to ascertain if the school gymnasium did have a recreational purpose or an intent to be used for recreational purposes . D. Does the KTCA apply to both unsupervised and supervised activities ? <p> The Kansas Trial Lawyers Association ( KTLA ) amicus curiae brief argued that the Kansas Legislature intended to apply immunity only for unsupervised activities ( e.g. , going to a park and playing frisbee ) . In the opinion of the KTLA , K.S.A. 75-6104(o) was not intended to provide an exception to liability for supervised activities like a required physical education course that is part of a broader educational curriculum . The Kansas Supreme Court , however , stated that there was no distinction between supervised and non-supervised activities . Specifically , the courts referred to the language of the K.S.A. 75-104(o) , explaining that if the legislature had intended to distinguish between supervisory and non-supervisory activities , they would have done so . E. Was the defendant school teacher engaged in a discretionary act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K.S.A. 75-6104(e) ) . Discretionary acts represent acts of policy and decision making . Ministerial acts , on the other hand , represent operational , routine , and daily tasks . Heim ( 1991 ) states , " the discretionary exception from liability is the single most encompassing immunity provision of the KTCA . It provides the broadest scope of immunity of any of the 19 exceptions . " As explained by van der Smisson ( 1990 , p. 166 ) , " There is no duty to initially perform a function , but once it is " undertaken , " then there is liability for doing the function with due care . " The decision to perform or not perform a function ( i.e. , required physical education ) represents a policy decision , i.e. , a discretionary act . The actual operation or execution of the function represents a ministerial function . In this case , based on case precedent and the original concept of discretionary and ministerial immunity , the policy and curriculum-related decision to offer required physical education and to provide resources to maintain the facility reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation and execution of the day-to-day lesson plans and related classroom supervisory responsibilities reflect ministerial acts ( Hyman v. Green , 1987 ; van der Smissen , 1990 ) . The court-of appeals-considered the teacher 's decision to allow a springboard-basketball activity during supervised school hours to represent a discretionary decision . The Kansas Supreme-Court appeared to believe that the case was appropriately disposed of under recreational immunity provided in KSA 75-6104(o) . II . Have the Kansas Courts Legitimized a Reduced Standard of Care for Physical Educators ? A Critical Analysis of the Kansas Supreme Court 's decision in Jackson v. USD #259 <p> As mentioned above , the implications-associated with the court 's interpretations of governmental immunity appear to insulate physical educators from liability while enabling them to exercise a lower standard of care free of impunity . The following discussion elaborates on issues within the Jackson case that appear troubling and preclude the plaintiff(s) from recovering when he/she has been the subject of a wrong ( i.e. , negligent instruction , supervision , equipment selection ) . A. Plaintiff 's failure to argue gross and/or willful/wanton negligence <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not discussed by the court . In fact , the plaintiff admitted that the act causing the injury failed to represent an act of gross negligence . However , one could debate the prudence of the plaintiff 's strategy and plaintiff counsel 's effectiveness in failing to argue that the defendant 's actions represented willful/wanton negligence . As mentioned earlier , the KTCA provides immunity for prescribed activities or governmental areas with noted exceptions . Hence , even if the appellate court held that the defendant 's behavior was discretionary in nature , this immunity can be nullified when the plaintiff successfully proves the defendant 's action represented willful/wanton behavior . A willful/wanton behavior is defined as ( Black 's Law Dictionary , p. 1600 ) , " conduct which is committed with .... reckless disregard for the safety of others . " The Kansas supreme court in Boaldin v. University of Kansas ( 1987 ) defined wantonness as " a realization of the imminence of danger and a reckless disregard or a complete indifference or an unconcern for the probably consequence of the wrongful act " ( quoting Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanning v. Anderson and BOE of Unjfied School District #447 ( 1996 ) a student-athlete was injured when hit by a discus as he was walking across the field and into the locker room . The Kansas court of appeals elaborated quite extensively on what qualifies as a gross or wanton act nullifying the protection provided by K.S.A. 75-6104(o) . Referring to prior case law and Professor Keeton 's Law of Torts , the court concluded that evidence of gross or wanton negligence is apparent when the defendant-employee has either constructive notice or notice of an injury that would be apparent to a reasonable person in similar or like circumstances . Similarly , in Oz.uk v. River Grove Board of Education , the Illinois appellate court decision adopted by the Kansas Supreme Court in the Jackson case , stated that willful and wanton behavior reflects situations where obvious danger is ignored or when the defendant permits " the plaintiff to engage in risky activity " ( Ozuk v. River Grove , 1996 ) . <p> Certainly one can argue in the Jackson case ( 2000 ) , the defendant 's permitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air during the school day represents the execution of an act with an obvious disregard for the risk and related consequences of the activity itself . In our opinion , the plaintiff 's attorney made an omission by not pursuing the issue of gross or wanton negligence , abrogating defendant protections. 2 . The denial of equal protection constitutional guarantees <p> Prior case law questions whether the immunity provided a government entity as a result of KTCA rationally relates to a legitimate government interest when non-government entities ( i.e. , gymnastics clubs , tennis centers ) performing similar functions do not have the same protection from liability . The Kansas district court addressed the KTCA 's equal protection constitutionality in Barret v. USD #259 ( 2000 ) . Although Judge Anderson 's decision in Barret lacks any controlling authority as a result of the subsequent Kansas Supreme Court decision in Jackson ( 2000 ) , the case still presents interesting issues for discussion . <p> In Barret ( 2000 ) , a high school student-athlete died from heat exhaustion during pre-season football practice . Both plaintiffs and defendants filed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing an exception to liability for injuries occurring in an open area for a recreational purpose . The plaintiffs , on the other hand , argue that this statutory immunity violates equal protection constitutional guarantees . Citing Dorsey v. Solomon ( 1977 ) , the United States District Court for the District of Maryland stated , " The doctrine of equal protection means that similarly situated persons must receive similar treatment under the law . " The Kansas district court in Barret ( 2000 ) elaborates on the alleged constitutional inequities with the following illustration . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Similar arguments highlighting the different legal responsibilities of schools and teachers , as well as the different legal recourse and legal protection available to the injured plaintiff , exist between physical educators teaching in recreational spaces and nonphysical educators teaching in nonrecreational spaces . In addition , the distinction can be made between private schools and public schools . A plaintiff injured on the football field of a public school would have no recourse for the injurious negligent omissions or commissions of a physical educator . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football field at a private school would have recourse for the wrong . Consequently , the injured plaintiffs are being denied an equal protection of the laws . Similarly , a strict interpretation of K.S.A. 75-6104(o) would provide injuries plaintiffs with a different standard of proof when injured in recreational areas versus in chemistry or science classes where injuries also are likely or foreseeable . As summarized by the Barret ( 2000 ) court , " The same classes of people are discriminated against solely based on the location of the tort , a distinction with no sensible difference . Such a rule creates a double standard without a reasonable basis , a constitutional anomaly . " 3 . Misinterpretation of discretionary v. ministerial acts <p> The Barret ( 2000 ) district court also discussed the issue of discretionary immunity as provided by K.T.C.A. 75-6104(e) . Although no statutory definition exists , prior case law is helpful in ascertaining what qualifies as discretionary immunity . In Greider v. Shawnee Mission U.S.D. No. 5/2 ( 1989 ) , the U.S. district court summarizes prior case law and states the discretionary immunity defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists . " In Greider , the district court 's summary of case law contributed to the conclusion that discretionary immunity was not available since there was a readily ascertainable standard and a legal duty to act in a certain manner . In Greider ( 1989 ) , a student was injured due to lack of supervision and instruction while participating in a woodworking class . The district court held there was a duty to provide for the student 's safety and to explain how to operate the tools , and then supervise operation . In Kansas State Bank &; Trust Company v. Specialized Transportation Services ( 1991 ) , the court held that existing , well-established procedures that the defendants failed to follow could not be protected as discretionary acts subject to immunity . Similar to Greider ( 1989 ) , physical educators and coaches should be responsible for providing adequate , non-negligent care . Physical educators are granted state teaching certificates only upon the completion of an accredited curriculum that includes education on safety-related issues . Lesson plans and established curricular guidelines exist for physical educators . To hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome . As explained by the district court in Barret ( 2000 ) , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> As a Kansas Supreme Court decision , the Jackson ( 2000 ) decision is troublesome if discretionary immunity is expanded to insulate a person from an appropriate professional standard of care . Unless fact dissimilarities can be shown , an appeal is pursued , or legislative action amending the KTCA occurs , the legitimization of a lower professional standard of care for physical educators could be perpetuated . <p> Although not considered by the KS Supreme Court , it seems obvious that allowing the student to engage in this springboard-basketball activity does not represent behavior that would be exercised by a reasonable , prudent professional physical educator . Injury in this springboard-basketball activity was foreseeable . The activity was not part of any lesson plan . It is not an activity professional educators would recommend as part of a physical education curriculum . To hold this activity as a discretionary act only diminishes the standard of care provided to students to a sub-par level . While the spirit of the KTCA is to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations of the KTCA serve to excuse , if not justify , inadequate and sloppy instruction and student supervision . 4 . Misinterpretation of the term " recreational purpose " as stated in K.S.A. 75-6104(o) <p> As mentioned above , common law decisions based on precedent require similar fact patterns . Similar to the above discussion , one could ask whether activity during a compulsory school day reflects the same type of " recreational purpose " as fishing , playing in a league softball game , etc. that the legislature intended to immunize when the KTCA was passed in 1979 . Did the courts in the Jackson case ( 2000 ) mold the facts and stretch the statutory interpretation resulting in unjust immunity protecting the school and the physical educator but providing no recourse to the injured plaintiff for the wrong endured ? Another point is noteworthy . The Jackson court relied on the similarities in statutory language between the K.T.C.A. and the Illinois Tort Immunity Act , 3-106 . However , the Illinois statute provides immunity to " any public property intended or permitted to be used for recreational purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open areas , buildings or other enclosed recreational facilities . " The Illinois statute language is certainly more expansive than the KTCA . The Illinois statute provides immunity for injury occurring on " any public property intended or permitted to be used as a park , playground or open area for recreational purposes . " It is well accepted that legislation should be interpreted literally , statutory intent to be derived from the language itself . Consequently , if the Kansas Legislature had intended to be more inclusive in their exception to liability ( including , for example , inside gymnasiums ) , would not it have done so ? III . Summary <p> Governmental immunity statutes have evolved greatly over the past 50 years to better provide for the remedy of a wrong and an equal protection of the laws ( van der Smissen , 1990 ) . However , common law continues to provide immunity for government organizations and individual employees under the guise of protecting the governmental agency ( i.e. , the public schools ) , maximizing benefits associated with the citizen 's tax dollars , and encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interpretation of a discretionary act and what qualifies as public recreation insulates the physical educator from liability . While attractive to the school and educator immunized from liability , this interpretation violates the spirit and objective of tort law ( i.e. , to remedy a wrong ) and abdicates individual professional responsibilities ( i.e. , effective and prudent teaching ) . <p>
