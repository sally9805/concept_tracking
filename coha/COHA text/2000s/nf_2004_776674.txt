On the ninth day of the war , there was some bombing , but it was desultory , mostly on the fringes of the city . People came out to shop , and a few businesses opened their doors . In the late afternoon , I went out for a drive with a couple of friends . On Sadoun Street , sidewalk vendors were selling kerosene lamps and plastic jerricans for storing water and fuel . A few men were buying bread and eggs and vegetables for their families from the stallholders around Tahrir Square . In a dusty strip of park , a group of boys played soccer , and a man was shining shoes . We stopped for tea in an ancient coffeehouse on Rashid Street , in the former Jewish quarter . It was filled with old men playing dominoes and smoking narghila waterpipes . Some watched the television set , which was showing scenes of Iraqi civilians and soldiers around the country dancing and waving weapons , singing odes to Saddam Hussein and chanting slogans against George W. Bush . The atmosphere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television images , it felt almost as if there were no war . // At about nine o'clock , after having dinner at one of Baghdad 's two restaurants still open for business , we heard that there had been a bombing in which many civilians had been killed . We raced out to the place , which was on the northern outskirts of Baghdad . About twenty minutes later , we arrived at the Al-Nur General Hospital in the Shia suburb of Al Shualla . There , the hospital director , Dr. Haqqui Razuki , told us that a warplane had struck a marketplace just a few hundred yards away . Razuki was polite but angry ; he believed the attack had been deliberate . The bombing had occurred a couple of hours earlier , at dusk , when the market was crowded with people . Thirty-five dead and forty-seven injured people had been brought into his hospital , but some of the casualties had been taken elsewhere . ( The final death tally was sixty-two . ) Wordlessly , Razuki 's assistant led us through hallways thronged with soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There , we passed a man who had his face turned to the wall . He was sobbing in a loud , grief-stricken way into his folded arms . We walked on . A few moments later , still sobbing , he came up behind us fast and then , breaking into a run , he overtook us. // We arrived at an aluminum hut . The sobbing man was standing there with some other men next to a young hospital attendant wearing a filthy smock . The attendant opened the door , and a blast of cold air came out . Inside , I could see four dead men lying in contorted poses . The weeping man dove wildly inside , crying disconsolately , but another man , a friend of his , pulled him back out and away from the doorway . The dead men 's bodies were torn up and bloody , and their clothes were ragged and dirty . There was a lot of blood on the floor . Some nurses appeared , older women wearing white head scarves , and began keening quietly . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretcher and brought outside . Other men arrived carrying a plain wood coffin and placed the dead man inside it . Several of the men broke down in tears and held their heads with their hands as this took place , calling out the dead man 's name , " Haidar , " over and over again . They placed the lid on the coffin and hoisted it onto their shoulders . As they set off , they repeatedly chanted the Koranic verse " There is only one God . " As they went by , the morgue attendant came and stood very close to me . I gagged at his stench , which was of dead bodies . // In the local mosque , where the dead were being taken to be washed and prayed over , people stood around quietly . A stream of coffins came and went through the front door . Men smoked cigarettes or simply stared . A black banner across one wall was illustrated with an image of the decapitated head , gushing blood , of Imam Ali Hussein , the martyr of Shia devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken outside , the bearers singing their praise to God , as before in the hospital . On a vacant lot just outside , they set down the coffin and knelt in prayer . Red tracer fire from an antiaircraft gun floated into the sky above us. // I walked down the lane to the scrubby little marketplace where the bomb had hit . It had left a tiny crater , just a meter in diameter and very shallow , at the edge of a little plaza surrounded on two sides with modest market stalls . The stalls were ravaged looking , their tin roofs torn up , and a large pool of water had formed in front of a burst waterpipe , which still gushed torrentially . From one of the houses across the street , I heard the sound of a woman crying . Soon , other people began weeping too , and as they did , the woman 's cries became screams . // ( Continues ... ) //                    @
