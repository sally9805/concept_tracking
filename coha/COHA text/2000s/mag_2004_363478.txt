" The biggest issue in this election is jobs and economic security , " Howard Dean said in Urbandale , Iowa , a few days after Christmas . " Iraq is an important issue , but it 's not as important as jobs . " This seemed to be the sort of thing Dean practically never does  --  a descent into standard party cant . Democrats are almost always depressed about the economy and rarely obsessed by foreign policy . It was doubly odd because Iraq has been Dean 's signature issue . He would probably be an asterisk today if he had n't stepped out from the pack and opposed the war . And the election of 2004 is bound to be , in the end , a referendum on George W. Bush 's historic pre-emptive decision to route the war on terrorism through Baghdad . <P> But Dean is n't really talking about jobs , even when he says , " Let 's talk about jobs , " which he does , first and foremost , in every stump speech . Very quickly he turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts for his wealthy contributors . " Indeed , " jobs "  --  shorthand for the 3 million jobs lost during the Bush Administration  --  turns out to be camouflage for an even hotter topic : the rampaging privileges that the corporate elites have won during the past three years . This is Dean 's real theme , a unified-field theory of Republican depravity . Jobs , the elderly , the economy , budget discipline , the environment  --  all have suffered because of Bush 's crony capitalism . Dean recently produced a fabulous piece of propaganda , a leaflet called Common Sense for a New Century , after Tom Paine 's famous Revolutionary War tract . " We face a growing threat to our liberty and justice in America today , " he writes . " Thomas Jefferson and James Madison spoke of the fear that economic power would one day seize political power . That fear is now being realized . Under the Bush Administration , pharmaceutical companies draft our Medicare laws . Oil executives sit in the Vice President 's office and write energy bills ... " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the people versus the powerful "  --  and four years after Al Gore unsuccessfully ran on that slogan , populism is at the heart of not just Dean 's campaign but almost every Democratic presidential candidacy . Senator John Edwards puts the case most elegantly : " This is an Administration that rewards wealth , not work . " Dick Gephardt is the protectionist tribune of the antique industrial unions . Aristocratic John Kerry rails effectively against " Benedict Arnold " corporations that set up headquarters overseas to avoid paying taxes at home . Even mild , moderate Joe Lieberman has a tax plan to soak the rich and further reduce taxes on the middle class . There may be some desperation in all this . Bush has taken issue after issue away from the Democrats . He has " reformed " education and given a prescription-drug benefit to the elderly  --  fairly sketchy initiatives , but most voters do n't read policy papers . The economy seems poised to recover . And the President may even be moving quietly toward depriving the Democrats of their most popular foreign-policy complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO in Iraq . ( Both may well be involved in the transition to a new Iraqi government this spring. )
