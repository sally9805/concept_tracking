Christie <br> When you met Christie for the first time , it took only minutes to learn that she was from Greenwich , Connecticut , but months could go by before you got another solid fact out of her . After a couple of years in New York , she realized that she had to give people a little more information to stop them from digging , so once she 'd mentioned Greenwich she would quickly add that she 'd gone to " the high school , " meaning the public one . The first time she said this , you 'd find her forthrightness refreshing  --  disarming , even , in the midst of so many pretenders . You 'd be prompted , perhaps , to admit something about yourself  --  the fact that you were doing Jenny Craig , for instance , and had to sneak the packaged food into your office microwave when no one was paying attention . But then you 'd overhear Christie making the same confession to someone else , and it would lose its charm . It was just Fact No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her childhood in Greenwich  --  represented the sum total of what could be stated about Christie Thorn 's background , about her entire life before college and New York , where I 'd met her . <br> Plus , you could n't help being suspicious of her motives in revealing Fact No. 2 . If , at a party , a group of people were standing around , sharing a corner of a room , and someone made an opening bid  --  mentioning Hotchkiss or St. George 's , say  --  Christie would always pointedly interject , " Oh , I would n't know . I went to public school . Greenwich High . That 's right  --  I was a good old suburban kid . " Of course , Christie and the person who had mentioned boarding school were doing the same thing  --  preemptively defending themselves against attack  --  yet rightly or wrongly you were tempted to give the Hotchkiss guy a free pass . With him you could figure that his parents had divorced badly , or his mother was an alcoholic , or his brother had committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdose ) , or that in keeping with the family tradition Dad had gone crazy and now spent his days in slippers and a robe shooting intricate , archaic forms of pool . On account of one or more of these family problems , the young man felt insecure about himself as an individual , and so , in moments of social anxiety , he mentioned boarding school a little too early , and a little unnaturally , to shore up his resolve . Still , whatever his problem , whatever the big bad family secret , it was just the slightly burned edge on a cake that everyone still wanted to eat . How bad could those family problems really be , you 'd asked yourself more than once , if , at the same time , you had the house in Edgartown ? How bad  --  if you had the gray shingles , the weathered shutters , the slanting attic roof , the iron bedstead , the needlepoint pillow on the wicker settee proclaiming " A woman 's place is on the tennis court ! " the batterie de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the octagonal kitchen window , through which you could glimpse the dunes and smell the salt air  --  could anything really be ? <br> Meanwhile , you 'd assume that Christie had more to protect , that her history was more embarrassing , somehow : a chronological downsizing of suburban homes ( all of them , albeit , technically in Greenwich ) , a cheapness in things like bedding and glassware , or four people sharing one bathroom with a stand-up shower . And you would n't be wrong . The real story was simple , of course , and if it was sad , the sadness lay only in the gap between it and Christie 's grand expectations . Christie 's father had gone into business for himself and had cash flow problems . That was all . No one had murdered anyone ; there was n't a whiff of incest or abuse , embezzlement , or even tax fraud . Mr. Thorn had owed money his whole life , but he paid his bills more or less on time , and when he died , his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was an honest man with a clean conscience . <br> Yet Christie 's conscience was not clean , and seemed never to have been . In a typical scenario from her adolescence , her father would plan a nice vacation for the family , then would n't be able to swing it , Christie would throw a tantrum , and her mother , who spoiled her , would charge the trip on her credit card to appease her . Christie would go on the vacation , but she would go alone , with a similarly spoiled friend . She and the friend would go helling around Key West , say , or Miami Beach , feeling worse and worse and worse and laughing harder and harder . And then , and this was the kicker , Christie 's mother would pick them up at LaGuardia ( the friend 's mother could never be bothered ) and would want to know  --  would have been anxious about , primordially concerned about  --  whether they 'd had a good time . <br> On the way back from one of these vacations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friend checked in late and were bumped up to first class . They were separated and Christie was seated next to a affluent-looking older man . The man drank Scotches and read a golf magazine , and , when the flight was delayed , the two became partners in peevish complaint , the man turning to Christie to include her in his " Can you believe this ? " glare . Eventually , he asked her where she was from , and when she said , " Greenwich , " he looked at her with a kind of absolute approval that Christie could n't recall ever having inspired before . After that , whenever a flight of hers was delayed she 'd shake her head and say , " Time to spare , go by air , " as the Scotch-drinking man had , and when she met people , she liked to make sure that they knew where she was from . <br> After college ( four ambitious yet misguided and ultimately obscure years at Colgate ) after a prolonged phase of running around New York while drifting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she had slept with fifty-five , or was it sixty-five men , Christie found someone to marry . We spent a lot of time speculating as to who would be invited to the wedding ( only a strange , angry girl named Mary McLean , who had made some Faustian bargain with Christie long before any of us met her , considered herself one of Christie 's real friends ) , but in the end everyone was invited  --  to the Pierre , no less . Throughout the evening , Christie wore a look of incurable dissatisfaction . Her face was gaudily made up , as if for a school play or an ice-skating competition . At the reception , her parents seemed frightened . It was as if they had been instructed to keep their mouths shut at all costs . A guest would shake Mrs. Thorn 's hand in the receiving line and say , " Hi , I 'm Jen Ryan . Christie and I were roommates at Colgate " and Mrs. Thorn would nod , grim-faced , and say  --  literally  --  nothing , a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The groom 's name was Thomas Bruewald , and he was gawky and tall , with an oversized head and a unibrow . His parents were never identified ; perhaps they were not in attendance . Apparently they were foreign . He had grown up half over here and half over there  --  in Bavaria , was it ? Or Croatia ? At any rate , it was n't Umbria or Aix or anywhere worth trying to lock in an invitation for . Bruewald had gone to one of those Euro institutes with the word polytechnical in the name . The champagne at the reception was a little too good , and some people had more than their fill and , by the end of the night , were making rude remarks . One guy said that Christie 's parents must have taken out a second mortgage to pay for the wedding . " Did n't know you could get a second mortgage on a trailer , " a yet unmarried , embittered young woman said . And then , of course , you got " Hey , wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unison  --  " in Greenwich , Connecticut ! " But nobody said that the groom was funny-looking . You could pick on Christie for trying too hard , you could note the moment when Mr. Thorn said , " Fuck it , " took off his tuxedo jacket , and started doing body shots with the bridesmaids , but you did n't pick on the groom 's looks . You just did n't go there . <br> Christie herself was quite pretty . Her features were large and unflawed , her hair was dyed only a shade or two lighter than it would have been naturally , and , in an age when Manhattan had been overrun by the kind of chain stores you 'd find at a suburban mall , these attributes had kept her in dates for a decade and the word beautiful had been lobbed over her head with surprising  --  to some of us , disturbing  --  frequency . <br> The groom had some kind of science-related job  --  engineering drug research  --  that required a reverse commute to New Jersey . And once the wedding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had registered for everything but the kitchen sink , in anticipation , evidently , of dinners for sixteen at which oysters would be served and finger bowls required ) , once the thank-you note from Christie  --  Christie Bruewald now , of course  --  had arrived , it seemed that only the sparsest smattering of social interactions was indicated , a coffee or a drink with her perhaps twice a year . There was even some thought that the newlyweds would move out of the city . Christie had long anticipated children ( little trophies , one presumed , to fill up that bottomless pit of dissatisfaction ) , and the suburbs had been held up as a superior way of life even , as I recall , when she was still single . <br> Christie 's new thing , at our biannual meetings , was to brag about her visits to see Thomas 's family in Europe . It was mystifying  --  one would not have thought an " in " in the former East Germany particularly bragworthy , and , in any case , everyone at the wedding had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade they had made . Did she think we did n't see her boasts for what they were ? She started to slip into conversation the fact that Thomas 's uncle had a title , or had had one  --  she was vague on the details  --  and she mentioned straightfacedly that there was a castle in the family . Her Christmas card ( sent yearly to all of us , even though we had not sent one to her in years ) introduced the Bruewald family crest . It was all so ludicrous and pathetic , really , when they were living in a studio in a high-rise on York Avenue . <br> " So why do you even see her ? " my husband would ask . ( I was married now , too . ) " If she 's so awful , why do n't you dump her ? Just do n't call back . " Like most men , he had no patience with these pseudo- friendships between women that drag on for years . The question troubled me , and in my head I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruewald , nTe Thorn , at six-month intervals . First , in an anthropological observation sort of way , I enjoyed taking note of her pretensions . I enjoyed seeing how far she would go . In a way , I had exulted in the family-crest Christmas card . I had put it up on the refrigerator and shown it to everyone who came over . I was just dying , now , to see what would follow . When I met her for coffee , I went prepared with a mental tape recorder to catch her appalling lapses in taste  --  not so much for myself as to pass on to everyone else . Second , there were , and this was harder to admit , sparks of humanity in Christie 's pretensions , and in her desires , that were missing from my life . She had coveted a huge diamond ring . She had hoped to land a guy with money . She had wanted her wedding to be an extravaganza , a day she 'd remember for the rest of her life . She was n't " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew what she wanted , and she wanted the kinds of things that the marketers of luxury goods describe as " the best "  --  Jacuzzis ; chandeliers ; access to the tropics in the middle of winter . Third , and finally what got me , I suppose , were the indications of humanity in Christie 's life that had nothing to do with the pretensions . The family crest on the Christmas card had been embossed onto a picture of the Bruewalds and their new baby , all three of them in matching red-and-green velvet outfits . The little girl looked exactly like Thomas  --  an odd-featured , brown-haired older man . She would n't have the advantage of her mother 's looks , and , for someone as entranced by the superficial as Christie was , that must have been hard to take . You could say that I felt sorry for Christie . <br> still , despite having my reasons for keeping in touch , a year or so after my own wedding I went through a period when I decided to burn the fat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong with New York . Of course , this really meant what I was tired of in myself , but I did n't see that then . I wrote " Seeing people like Christie Thorn " on a list of things that were a fatal waste of time , and when she called and left a message to start the back-and-forth that would culminate in our having lunch a few weeks later , I did n't call back . <br> Perhaps I ended it then simply because the interesting part of Christie 's story seemed to be over . Though my own life still seemed to me a fountain of infinite promise , hers felt blandly curtailed . I realized that there was a part of me that had almost wanted her to make it , on her own terms , whatever they might be . The somewhat sad thing about Christie 's wedding was that it had n't been outrageous at all ; it had been just another overpriced New York wedding spearheaded by a bride with too much makeup on . I found it all too easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would end . I lived with that story , kept the thread going in my mind , amending or extending from time to time , when some event in my own life recalled Christie 's unhappy mixture of envy and drive , of self- promotion and apology . <br> My version ( wholly fictional ) went something like this : Having married for money , Christie quickly discovers that she has n't married for enough . Realizing her mistake only deepens her underlying dissatisfaction , and , in order to convince herself that things can still change , she has an innocuous little affair in the first six months after the wedding . A year later , the second affair  --  with a secret dedicated cell phone ; a pregnancy scare perhaps  --  is not so innocuous nor so little . Thomas is doing as well as he ever has , but this is New York , and after their second child is born ( looking , thank-you-God , just like Daddy ) the Bruewalds are unable to afford a big enough apartment in the city and they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
