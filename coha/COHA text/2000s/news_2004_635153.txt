<p> These are the months of the great American garage sale . You know what a garage sale is : a cost-free way of getting a perfect stranger to haul away your junk . A handy few hours in your driveway getting a tan . <p> Of course , having a garage sale can be a risk to your ego , because you just might be revealing more about yourself than you intended . Worse yet , the browsers might walk away chuckling out loud over what you presumed to be worth their money . <p> Drive up and watch American capitalism at work . Sometimes , the garage sale host has mounted an aggressive marketing strategy , replete with signs , flags and piped-in music . Other times , they low-key it by sitting there indifferently reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle . Either way , they are subtly seducing the found-treasure instinct in potential buyers who seem to know by cosmic intuition when and where these events are to occur . <p> A question comes to mind : Do these buyers who cart away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kick up the prices , and mount their own garage sales ? <p> In some ways , garage sales are an allegory for America . They are rooted in the belief that cherishing the old is nowhere near as important as making room for the new . The attics of fairy tales nostalgically housed a family 's memories and memorabilia . The attics of today are deemed appropriate for little more than IRS receipts and periodic fire inspections . <p> My wife and I have never been able to ratchet down our sense of privacy enough to try one of these driveway adventures . And even though we 're told they 're a glib way to generate some tax-free revenue , we 've usually offered our extras to our children or to the local relief agencies . <p> As matters have turned out , both parties have responded with a thanks-but-no-thanks attitude . Which tells me that our odds and ends are probably not ready for prime time . But maybe that 's just as well , because when it comes to planting ourselves out there on our driveway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apologists for terror <p> Let me make sure I understand right . An American is beheaded in Iraq , and the Arab world broadcasts the savagery with nary a protest in response . Israeli soldiers are attacked and blown up , and the Arab world broadcasts the feat not to protest or shame , but to cheers throughout the Arab world . Saddam Hussein gassed Kurds and murdered and tortured his own beyond comprehension , yet the " Arab street " fell silent . <p> Yet when some prisoners are forced to stand on a box  --  surely wrong , but a far cry from murder and more akin to a college prank  --  all hell breaks loose across Arab television . Please . Enough of this garbage and hypocrisy . The more we serve as apologists for terror and bad behavior , the more we encourage it . <p> William Choslovsky , <p> Lincoln Park <p> Meaningless apology <p> If I were president and had been confronted with the Abu Ghraib prison fiasco , I would have ordered the prison bulldozed and all detainees released by nightfall . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States ' apology to the Iraqi people and Arabs everywhere . <p> But I 'm not president , and it may not be best to bulldoze first and ask questions later . But then , because I 'm not president , our soldiers will not be coming home tomorrow either . <p> James E. Gierach , <p> Oak Lawn <p> Treated like animals <p> Every time I hear or read of another soldier losing his life in Iraq I am saddened . Now , with the reports of Iraqi prison abuse , I am disgusted and even more saddened that our soldiers are treating these humans as animals . <p> I know about reports that our soldiers have tortured and killed civilians , but an eye for an eye is not the way to remedy this terrible conflict . We were all horrified by the pictures of the burning and display of the Americans hanged from the bridge . So what is our answer ? Ha-ha ! Look what we do daily . <p> As for Pfc . Lynndie England " being in the wrong place at the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " pencil pusher , " as her mother claims , she should have stayed behind her desk . She and all the others who have done this are a disgrace to our country . If she had n't treated those prisoners like animals , she would n't have to worry about being a " scapegoat . " <p> Joyce Sackman , Gurnee <p> Not just overseas <p> When making a comment about the mistreatment of the Iraqi prisoners of war , President Bush said we do n't do things like that in America . Mr. President , in your own state of Texas , a man was dragged behind a truck until his head was ripped off . You ridiculed a woman and her religion as you signed her execution papers . <p> Police sodomized a suspect with a plunger in New York . Police shot an unarmed man 30-plus times in New York . Innocent men are being released from incarceration after being tortured into confessions or simply railroaded into prison by a system that has made prisons a big business . <p> Mr. President : We do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garfield Park <p> End justifies the means <p> The day-in and day-out reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq by U.S. troops is wearing thin . <p> I 'm one American who does not care that some Iraqi prisoners were " humiliated . " If humiliating them is a way to produce useful information from them , the end justify the means . <p> The " humiliation " that these prisoners received was no worse than what was doled out to me and my college buddies while pledging a college fraternity in 1975 . <p> The abuse and humiliation of these prisoners pales in comparison to the slaughter of Daniel Pearl , Nick Berg and the four Americans who were killed , burned and hung up for display . <p> Let 's not forget these prisoners are not innocent children in need of DCFS protection . They are the enemy that tried to kill our troops . <p> Marc Flax , Lake Bluff <p> Cutting the cord <p> Kudos to the Sun-Times for stating the honest truth in the May 12 editorial , " Time for phone regulators to completely cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's time for the CLECs Competitive Local Exchange Carriers to stand on their own two feet . <p> They can either build their own networks ( the original intent of the 1996 Telecommunications Act ) , or they can rent ours , at market rates . <p> SBC has been waiting for 13 years to begin deploying the next-generation network . Perhaps now that day is close at hand . <p> Brian D. Williams , <p> Harwood Heights <p> Losing our jobs <p> The Grayslake writer of " A lesson in economics " letters , May 11 seems to thinks that if corporate income tax is done away with , everything would be just fine . The less than 8 percent that corporations now pay does n't seem to be the deciding factor when outsourcing American jobs . <p> The real reason is cheap labor , cheap labor , and cheap labor  --  to paraphrase the old real estate maxim . While debates on corporate taxes never end , our future is being exported to the lowest-wage country available . And when a new lower-wage country pops up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to pull our heads out of the sand and address the real problems facing our future : No jobs , no future . Simple . <p> Paul Ewing , Wilmington <p> Count all or not at all <p> I take issue with Robert Feder 's May 11 column " New ratings prompt political grandstanding " about Nielsen Research undercounting minority viewers . Feder missed the points being made by Congressmen Bobby Rush , Luis Gutierrez and Danny Davis , as well as the members of the City Council and state Legislature who stood with community groups like mine to bring light to this important issue . <p> We agree with Feder that using new technologies  --  like Local People Meters  --  to measure ratings have many benefits to everyone , if they work as promised . But let 's face it : Few new technologies work right out of the box . Nielsen has admitted that their new technology undercounts minority viewership . Therefore , we believe it does n't make sense to introduce the technology until it works for everyone . <p> Because Nielsen is a monopoly service whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we simply believe that any new system should do the count accurately before it comes to market . <p> I 'm sure Feder would agree to this simple request if his column 's readership were about to be undercounted . <p> Rev. James Demus , <p> executive director , <p> Southside NAACP <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " The tax corporations pay does n't seem to be the deciding factor when outsourcing jobs . The real reason is cheap labor , cheap labor , and cheap labor  --  to paraphrase the old real estate maxim . It 's time to address the real problems facing our future : No jobs , no future .
