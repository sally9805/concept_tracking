In every primary there is a moment of revelation , and in South Carolina mine came the day I grabbed my bags and jumped off George W. Bush 's bus . Most media hacks listen to the same speech three times daily , delivered ad nauseam to the 2% of the population that shows up at political rallies . But this hack was curious about the other 98% , and so I wandered into coffeehouses and barbecue joints , and eventually I came upon a place the Zagat restaurant guide missed altogether  --  the Roadkill Grill . <P> Intuition told me there had to be such a place . It sits along Highway 178 near Rocky Bottom , just shy of the North Carolina border . The Roadkill Grill is an outdoor barbecue pit on the property of Bob 's Place , a rustic beer tavern where the Confederate flag flies proud and the " Hillbilly Poem " is stapled to an outside wall . It reads , " We 're noted for our hard times and God 's great creation . We 're the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liked Bush , as did plenty of God-fearing family folk , party loyalists and professionals who fit more comfortably into the new South Carolina . But across the spectrum , the support seemed as soft and mushy as a bowl of yellow grits . When I asked why she liked Bush , Romaine Johnson , 73 , who runs Bob 's with son Tony , 47 , chewed on it and said , " Cuz he 's a good-lookin ' man . " She expected her regular customers to vote Bush . Why ? " I guess because they liked his daddy . " <P> It was then I knew two things : that Bush had South Carolina in his pocket and that he 's in trouble over the long haul if he does n't come up with a clear sense of why people ought to vote for him . <P> That is n't to say I did n't find any strong support . In Columbia , loan officer George Tisdale , 57 , liked Bush 's samurai tax cut and education policy . In Beaufort , retiree Lula ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her choice and even subjected herself to regular viewing of C-SPAN for enlightenment . She started Bush , tilted McCain and ended up sold on Bush as the man best suited to erase all memory of President Clinton . <P> But more often than not , when I asked people " Why Bush ? " it was as if they had a zinc deficiency . The smile would freeze , the eyes would cloud and all signs of intelligence would fade . It could just be that Bush has had trouble defining himself  --  never uttering the word reform and then suddenly parading a banner  --  or that the nasty , lowbrow campaign in South Carolina made us all a little dumber . <P> Tony Johnson , by the way , said he would have voted Bush except that as an ex-con , he had lost his voting rights . A friend chugged by in a pickup , and Tony made like The Rifleman , pretending to lock and load . It seemed prudent at this juncture to ask Tony why he 'd been in the can . Weapons charges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " he added , talking about my approach .
