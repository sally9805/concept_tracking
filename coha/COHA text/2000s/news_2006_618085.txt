<p> ' It only hurts when I walk on it . " " It 's just a little swollen . " " I 'm too busy . " <p> You might hear excuses like these from your guy when you try to get him to go to the doctor  --  whether he is in pain or just needs a checkup . <p> Jenny Dowd of Canton can relate . She said her husband , Mark , pops antacids every day to soothe his stomach ailments . " He always claims , ' Oh , it 's just heartburn , ' or ' Oh , I ate something that did n't agree with me . ' I call them his candy , and I tease him because he eats Tums every single day . It 's the last thing he does before he walks out the door to go to work , " she said . <p> How long has he practiced his Tums habit ? " Years , " she said . What 's worse , Dowd added , Mark has only visited a doctor once in 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Men tend to sort of approach life as a series of problems that have to be solved , and if there 's not a problem right in front of them , then typically they 're not going to try to solve something they ca n't see , " said Dr. Michael Witt , a urologist with Reproductive Biology Associates . " That , from a mind-set standpoint , makes men a little reluctant to do anything until they see something that needs to be done . " Along with a touch of male pride , this might account for men 's resistance . <p> Besides , he added , women are used to seeing a doctor regularly  --  starting with gynecological exams  --  as early as their teen years . <p> And when you 're thinking about problems that might occur down the line , it might be even harder to persuade men to see a doctor . <p> " Men tend not to be too informed about the need for preventive medicine , " agreed Dr. Sandy Carter Jr. , an internist in Sandy Springs .

" <p> For Jackson Moore , a cough , acid-reflux disease and an inability to sleep on his back were unrelated symptoms that he put up with for several years . His wife , Sharon , encouraged him to see a doctor , but he refused until he became a patient of Carter , who discovered the problem was a hiatal hernia . Now , Moore goes for a physical every year , he said . <p> It 's probably not fair to suggest that all men avoid the doctor . <p> " I 'm not going to accept that on face value , " said Dr. David Roberts , medical director of Emory Executive Health , a preventive-health program that serves businessmen and women through their companies ' participation . " I do n't know whether it is gender-specific or whether it is more situation-specific , because I 've got some busy , hard-charging executive women who are just as stubborn and recalcitrant as the stereotypical male would be . " <p> Peter Abreu is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of others in his family . <p> In fact , it was Abreu 's wife , Carol , who avoided doctors . On the other hand , Carol Abreu , a retired flight attendant from Roswell , gave her husband credit for jump-starting her health care . Carol had a family history of colon cancer , so she was scared what she might find out if she went to the doctor . At age 52 , she had never had a physical , she said . <p> " I was too afraid to go have an in-depth physical . Peter made me , " she said . <p> Luckily for Carol , Peter wore her down until she agreed to go . A colonoscopy detected cancerous cells . And without treatment , her doctors said , she would have died within six months . She is now recovering . <p> " Now I 'm the one that sets up the appointments every year for the physical , " Abreu said proudly . <p> DO N'T BE A NAG <p> Here are some tips about how to have a health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychologist , assistant professor and director of the Women 's Behavioral Health Program at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta . <p> * Tell him why you want him to go without being critical . For example , you might mention your fears : " It would make me feel better if you would go to the doctor because I 'm afraid what the symptoms might mean , and I 'm afraid you 're not getting the care you need . " <p> * Do n't get angry and call him stubborn or lazy . He might just be scared to go . <p> * Ask him if you can do anything to help , like find a doctor or make the appointment for him . You could also offer to go with him , if that would make him feel more comfortable . <p> * Ask for family and friends to talk to him , especially if they 're undergoing or have undergone similar procedures .

Dr. Sandy Carter Jr . said wives of his patients routinely call and tip him off to their concerns . <p> * Appeal to his sense of being a provider . " You have been a good provider for us ... one of the best ways that you can continue to be a provider for us is to take care of your own health so that you can be around for the long haul . " <p> * If he resists further treatment or appointments , tell him how important it is to follow the doctor 's recommendations .
