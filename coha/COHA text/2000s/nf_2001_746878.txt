Section : Articles <p> Summary : <p> Background : People with mental illness are at great risk of suicide , but little is known about their risk of death from other unnatural causes . No study has commented on their risk of being victims of homicide ; public concern is pre-occupied with their role as perpetrators . We aimed to calculate standardised mortality ratios ( SMRs ) and directly standardised rate ratios for death by homicide , suicide , and accident in people admitted to hospital because of mental illness . <p> Method : We did a population-based study in which we linked the data for 72 208 individuals listed in the Danish Psychiatric Case Register between 1973 and 1993 , and who died before Dec 31 , 1993 , with data in the Danish National Register of Causes of Death . <p> Findings : 17 892 ( 25% ) patients died from unnatural causes . Our results show raised SMRs for homicide , suicide , and accident for most psychiatric diagnoses irrespective of sex . The all-diagnosis SMRs for women and men , respectively , were : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for homicide , 1356 ( 1322-1391 ) and 1212 ( 1184-1241 ) for suicide , and 318 ( 305-332 ) and 466 ( 448-484 ) for accident . We recorded an increased risk of dying by homicide in men with schizophrenia and in individuals with affective psychosis . The highest risks of death by homicide and accident were in alcoholism and drug use , whereas the highest risks of suicide were in drug use . <p> Interpretation : People with mental disorders , including severe mental illness , are at increased risk of death by homicide . Strategies to reduce mortality in the mentally ill are correct to emphasise the high risk of suicide , but they should also focus on other unnatural causes of death . <p> Correspondence to : Prof Louis Appleby ( e-mail : Louis.Appleby@man.ac.uk ) Introduction <p> People with mental disorders have high rates of suicide , although estimates of risk vary according to duration of follow-up and in some diagnoses  --  ie , learning disability and dementia  --  high risk has not been seen. 1 There is less evidence on other kinds of unnatural mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homicides are frequently not distinguished. 2 Reports on homicide in association with mental illness focus on the mentally ill as perpetrators rather than victims , 3 , 4 and discrimination against the mentally ill is thought to arise in part from the perception that they are dangerous. 5 However , people with mental illness are also frequently victims of violent crime. 6 Our aim was to ascertain the risk of death by homicide , suicide , and accident in psychiatric patients . Methods <p> We did a study based on information collected about the Danish population over 21 years and entered in two databases : the Danish Psychiatric Case Register and the Danish National Register of Causes of Death . The Danish Psychiatric Case Register is a record of all people aged 15 years and older who have been admitted to hospital in Denmark with a psychiatric disorder since 1973. 7 We used the unique identification number that every Danish resident is assigned to link the data in these two registers . We thereby identified people on the case register between 1973 and 1993 who had died on or before Dec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , accident , or homicide . Open verdicts are often included in suicide analyses ; without their inclusion , suicide figures are underestimated. 8 <p> We included the following variables in our analysis : sex , age , year of death ( for standardisation ) , cause of death , and psychiatric diagnosis at first admission . During the study , we identified diagnoses and causes of death according to International Classification of Diseases , 8th edition ( ICD8 ) . This coding system changed in 1993 , and subsequent diagnoses by ICD10 were not strictly comparable . We included year of death because of the variability by year of death rates between different age groups . <p> We calculated standardised mortality ratios ( SMRs ) and 95% CIs by a person-years at risk method . Because SMRs can vary according to the age structure of the reference population , making internal comparisons  --  eg , between dementia and schizophrenia  --  difficult , rate ratios standardised directly to a common age distribution are sometimes preferable . In our study , the 1983 Danish population was used to calculate directly standardised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from SMRs they are also reported . Both SMRs and DSRRs are reported as proportions . We used STATA ( version 6.0 ) to calculate SMRs . Results <p> From 1973 to 1993 , 257 720 patients were added to the case register : 119 543 women and 138 177 men . During this period , 29 702 women and 42 506 men died , 17 892 ( 25% ) from unnatural causes ( 8098 women and 9794 men ) . Of these unnatural deaths , 181 ( 1% ) were by homicide , 12 977 ( 73% ) by suicide , and 4734 ( 26% ) by accident . The table shows the SMRs and crude rates by diagnosis and sex for homicide , suicide , and accident . In most diagnostic groups , there is a high rate of homicide . The highest relative risks were associated with drug use , alcoholism , personality disorders , schizophrenia ( men ) , and organic psychoses ( women ) . Overall , the risk of being a victim of homicide was increased six-fold for people with a mental illness compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups , but were higher in women with alcoholism ( DSRR 3176 ) or who had dementia ( 4088 ) , and in men with learning disabilities ( 2094 ) or who were drug users ( 4178 ) . <p> Risk of committing suicide was raised for both sexes in all diagnostic categories . Patients with alcoholism who were drug users , or who had affective psychoses or personality disorders were most at risk . Those least likely to commit suicide were patients with learning disabilities or dementia . Overall there was at least a 12-fold increase in risk in both sexes . DSRRs were similar to SMRs in most groups , but were higher in patients with affective psychoses ( women 2322 , men 2299 ) , dementia ( 1812,840 ) , and other non-psychotic conditions ( 2338,2199 ) . 1055 men ( 15% ) and 779 women ( 13% ) in the suicide sample received open verdicts . Excluding these patients from analyses made little difference to the SMRs except in the drug use ( women 16 377 , men 13 729 ) and alcoholism groups ( 12 976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also raised irrespective of diagnosis . The highest risks were in drug use and alcoholism . Overall , there was a three-fold increase in risk in women and a higher than four-fold increase in men . DSRRs were generally similar to SMRs but were lower in women with alcoholism ( 694 ) and men who were drug users ( 1153 ) . Discussion <p> Our results indicate high rates of death from homicide , suicide , and accident in people who have been psychiatric inpatients . Most psychiatric diagnoses were associated with increased mortality from all three causes , the highest risks of homicide and accident being in drug use and alcoholism , and the highest risk of suicide being in drug use . However , perhaps our most important finding is the high risk of death by homicide among people with mental disorders , including severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and affective psychoses . These findings on homicide have not been highlighted in previous reports of mortality in psychiatric patients. 2 , 9 <p> Inpatient facilities in Denmark are all in public hospitals . Our findings are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calculations of risk by two different methods did not affect overall conclusions . However , certain criticisms can be made . All individuals had been inpatients , suggesting severe illness . Estimates of risk , especially suicide risk , in a sample that included community patients might have been lower than the figures presented here . Furthermore , the diagnoses were based on judgments made by doctors and were not standardised . In some diagnosis or sex groups , especially in deaths by homicide , the estimated mortality ratios are based on only a few cases . Additionally , although the risk of homicide is raised , the actual risk remains substantially lower than the risk of suicide or death by accident . Finally , we do not know whether our findings can be extrapolated to other countries , which have different systems of mental-health care and for determining cause of death . <p> A high mortality from homicide in drug use and alcoholism might be predicted , since these groups would be expected to live in , and contribute to , a violent subculture . Why , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at increased homicide risk ? Several factors might contribute . First , such people might be more likely to live in places where homicide rates are generally high , such as inner cities . Second , they might have behavioural characteristics , such as alcohol or drug misuse , that increase their risk . Third , they might provoke the hostility of others through the symptoms of illness , such as irritability or paranoia . Fourth , they might , as a result of illness , be less aware of their own safety needs . Fifth , they might be killed by other mentally ill people with whom they are in contact  --  mentally ill people who kill , most often kill family members. 4 Finally , they might be more likely to be victims of motiveless killings because of their appearance . Whatever the cause , the public and the media , who have historically been concerned about the risk that the mentally ill present to others , should be made aware of the vulnerability of these patients to the violence of others . <p> However , most unnatural deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by contrast with previous findings , 1 that high rates of suicide in people with mental disorders extend to all diagnostic groups , including learning disability and dementia , though this finding could reflect the fact that all patients were ill enough at one stage to be admitted to hospital . There is also a high risk of death from accidental causes in all mental disorders . Our results particularly emphasise the risk of unnatural death in people with alcoholism who are drug users . Services for these groups should routinely assess suicide risk and alert their patients to the risks they could face . Overall , our findings confirm the need to emphasise suicide in any strategy to reduce mortality among the mentally ill , but they also show the need for such strategies to cover all unnatural deaths . <p> Acknowledgments <p> We thank Anne Vingrd Olesen for advice on analysis , and Gurli Pertu for help with record linkage and preparation of the dataset . <p> The work was funded by the Danish Medical Research Council . <p> Contributors <p> U Hiroeh , L Appleby , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
