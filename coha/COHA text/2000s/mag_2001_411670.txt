Remarks by WFB at a dinner honoring Robert L. Bartley , October 17 . The master of ceremonies was Daniel Oliver , and other speakers were David Frum , Christopher Buckley , Tom Wolfe , and Paul Gigot . Christopher Buckley 's toast is reproduced first : <p> When my father asked me to be on the program I happily agreed , for I feel that it is now safe for the world to know about the Other Bob Bartley . Not Bob Bartley , the great writer of editorials , or Bob Bartley , the scourge of liberals , or Bob Bartley , the 34-year-old wunderkind , but-as the character Max Bialystock in the movie and play The Producers put it- " the Fhrer with a song in his heart . " <p> I first met Bob at the National Review anniversary dinner in 1985 . At this grand occasion-attended by President Ronald Reagan , blessings be upon his name-I found that I would be seated next to him . When I noticed this placement on the program , I was overcome with nervousness . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Wall Street Journal editorial pages were taken as Holy Scripture , and now I was about to have several hours of close proximity to The Great Bob Bartley . <p> In something very close to panic , I sought guidance during the cocktail hour from someone I knew who was close to him personally . What was he like ? I asked . What topics of conversation should I pursue ? Did he have any hobbies ? This person , who shall remain nameless , but whom , at the time , I underestimated , took in my distress and suavely replied , " Oh , not to worry . He 's casual as can be . A great one for small talk . And he loves-loves-above all things in life-a really good off-color joke . As for hobbies , not many people know about it , but he has this thing for soap opera . He tapes them and watches them at night . He has an encyclopedic knowledge of As the World Turns and Guiding Light . Get him going on soap opera and you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " <p> I was greatly relieved by this intelligence . I would be spending the dinner hour not only with one of the great minds of our time , but also , clearly , with a regular guy , a man of the common touch . Indeed I found myself wishing I knew more about soap opera . Presently I found myself at Table 38 with the great man . I found him entirely pleasant , if not quite the bubbly small-talker I had been told to expect . Perhaps it had been a hard day at the office . So I awaited my chance . As soon as my wife and Edith Bartley were engaged in their own conversation , I leaned over and said , " So , how many lesbians does it take to screw in a light bulb ? " <p> His reception of my little jeu d'esprit seemed somewhat muted . I put it down to the acoustics of the Grand Ballroom . When the main course had been served , I seized my chance to engage him in something I knew to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at the table said , " So , Bob , I hear you 're a great aficionado of soap opera . Do you think Susan Lucci will finally win a daytime Emmy this year ? " Again his response struck me as muted . Indeed , quite so . He looked at me owlishly , with an expression of seven-eighths disdain and one-eighth contempt , as if he had been suddenly thrust into the company of someone prematurely released from an asylum for the mentally feeble . My wife , who at the time worked for the CIA and was adept at evaluating disastrous situations , kicked me under the table . <p> Thus began-and ended-my long personal association with Robert Bartley . After the dinner was over , I sought out the person who had given me the pre-dinner briefing . I found him hiding in a bathroom stall , convulsed in hysterics . <p> I shot him , and disposed of the body in what is now the Meadowlands Sports Complex . <p> And yet as I look back upon it , I 'm somewhat grateful to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing , I probably would have attempted to engage the Great Man conversationally in such matters as the Laffer Curve , the conquest of Grenada , or David Stockman . And no doubt he would have found my offerings on those banal , if somewhat less alarming than the conversation I ended up offering him . This way I can at least look back and say that for a brief , if not shining , moment , I had the whole of Robert Bartley 's attention . We connected . If he himself has no recollection of it-having put it out of his mind long ago-I do , a vivid one , and it remains somehow one of the great moments of my life , rococo , improbable , proud . <p> Thus the theme of my toast to him . I feel like the tumbler in the medieval tale who , amidst all the wise and scholarly monks , had only his one small talent to offer up , and performed his humble and awkward obeisance . But seldom do I get the chance to play the fool so gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's obvious at this point that you are glad to join me in this opportunity to affirm our enthusiasm for the labors of our guest of honor . I had a preview of some of the remarks we have listened to , and so had an intimation of how well they 'd express our feelings . I was not made privy to how our master of ceremonies would handle himself . But I was reminded of his meticulous sense of duty and of the depth of his self-assurance when I got his e-mail a week ago in which , responding to my ukase limiting the speakers to four minutes each , he caviled that four minutes would not allow time for anticipated applause . <p> He was certainly right , and he has now my own applause , spoken , not handclapped , happily wrenched from the four minutes I allotted myself , applause for his wit and ingenuity . Norman Podhoretz told me months ago that the highlight of the dinner in Indianapolis celebrating the anniversary of the Hudson Institute had been Dan Oliver 's introductions . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to acclaim him as the evening 's highlight would subordinate the performance of the Jim Cullum Jazz Band . Nothing spoken can , finally , compete with the spectrum of sentiments rendered in music , certainly not when competing with the music of Jim Cullum , with my idol John Sheridan at the keyboard . Dan Oliver has the option of turning , in later life , to music , for the next time around-which will be when ? On the retirement of Paul Gigot ? <p> On the other hand , that leaves open the question , Will we be disposed to celebrate the retirement of Paul Gigot , down the line ? That should be phrased more carefully , inasmuch as we are here , after all , to celebrate not Bob Bartley 's retirement , but his achievements upon retiring . It never surprised me or my colleagues that Paul should achieve his high station . It is n't easy to bump into the datum from routine accounts of his biography , but we on 35th Street never made a secret of it that after leaving Dartmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Review , before going abroad to tame the alien beasts . How could he fail ? - it being as unthinkable that he should do so as that supply-side economics will be discredited . <p> That will happen over Bob Bartley 's dead body , and he seems very full of life tonight , however singed he and his staff were by the energumens of September 11 . It is a great pleasure to read , in his celebration of the Seven Fat Years brought on by economic policies associated with President Reagan , his account of the evolution of the idea of supply side , accomplished bit by bit at myriad lunches at a little restaurant downtown-Michael 1 , it 's called- which seems to have served as the Garrick Club of Wall Street . There they met to reify their insight , to distill supply side and explore its ramifications . There , with Bob Bartley , we would come across others , including Bob Mundell and Jude Wanniski , and Craig Roberts and Alan Reynolds , and of course Arthur Laffer . <p> The crystallization of those insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wrote , was deduced from a curve sketched by its author , Laffer , on a napkin , or a piece of toilet paper , whichever , normally put to better use . In a televised exchange on the subject , done in Miami in 1972 when we were reporting on the Democratic Convention , the Laffer Curve came up . I volunteered my own definition , which was that supply-side economics is the perception that economically valuable activity is generated by diminished taxation , regulation , and other impediments to commerce . He nodded his head condescendingly and told our audience on the Today show that all this was in any case irrelevant , given the predictable victory next November of Candidate George McGovern ; wherein Professor Galbraith established that his vaticinations in politics were as reliable as those in economics . <p> It is n't the supply-side epiphany that memorializes the career of Bob Bartley at the Wall Street Journal . David Frum , telling us about it all as a one-time insider , and Paul Gigot , speaking to us from the perspective of the successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His achievement was cumulative . Day by day , year by year , he showed his lively intelligence , and gave us his stylish defense of freedom , exploring its implications . He stood by convictions arrived at by research and analysis , and advanced a civilized integration of major human events into the democratic moral scene . To be sure , Mr. Clinton was not ejected by the Senate , but he was impeached . He did not go to jail , but he was disbarred . Reflection on the events of those years does n't tell us that the conclusions of Robert Bartley were wayward , or that those of Senator Moynihan and the New York Times evolved from impetuosity , when they deplored Clinton 's behavior , to considered constitutional and moral acuity when they chose to overlook it . It is closer to the point to note that what is finally tiresome is public indifference , not fidelity of standard . Cato taught us that , or tried to . <p> Modes of expression change . Not always for the better . It is a mystifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how best to judge that which is better , or worse . I , to serve myself up as an offering on the altar of progress , am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that the National Review currently edited by a successor is an improvement , inconceivable though that would once have been thought . <p> As inconceivable as that the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal , under Paul Gigot , will improve on that of our guest of honor , though we concede the hypothetical possibility . But the day will never come when the singular cast of Bob Bartley 's thirty years will lose its special character , and the day wo n't come-certainly not in my lifetime , let alone Irving Kristol 's , or , maybe , even Tom Wolfe 's ! - when studied reflection on the contributions of Bartley to right reason , and on his lovely expressions of it , will incur anything less than the gratitude we express here tonight . - WFB <p> <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Christopher Buckley and William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
