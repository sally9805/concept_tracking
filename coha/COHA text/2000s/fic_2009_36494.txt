In the late winter of 2006 , I returned to my home town and bought 612 acres of land on the far western edge of the county . The land was forested , undeveloped , and surrounded by hills and farms ; no one had lived on it for years . According to my information , it had been bought by the state from a variety of owners during the 1970s , with the intention of turning it into a recreational wilderness . But the state ran out of money and the project never got off the ground . The land , and the farmhouse that stood on it , were forgotten . <p> My interest in the land was greeted with suspicion by the real estate agent who had been contracted to sell it . A stocky , moon-faced , startlingly short woman in her thirties , she pursed her lips and gazed at me through tired pretty eyes across a cheap aluminum desk . Her name was Jennifer . <p> " Will you take me to see it ? " I asked her . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told me . " No roads go through . At least not any I know about . I can show you the house , though . " <p> " That would be fine . " <p> " It 's a fixer-upper , " she warned . <p> " I 'm very handy . " <p> She regarded me with a wary look , as though she doubted my seriousness . We could n't go out until after lunch , she said , when " the other girl " came in . It was ten in the morning . <p> " I 'll take a stroll around town and see the sights , " I said . <p> " That 'll kill maybe five minutes , " was her snorted reply . I responded with a smile and stepped out the door . <p> Gerrysburg , New York , population 2,310 and falling . That 's what the internet had told me . When I lived here , as a child , the town had been growing-4,000 people at least , many of whom worked at one of the two busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milan . One of the plants was owned by General Electric , which moved production to Asia in the eighties . The other was run by a manufacturer of silverware and other cooking implements that went out of business before I even left . There was , at that time , a great deal of talk about keeping families and businesses in Gerrysburg and attracting tourists . But now it was clear that all efforts had failed . The town was in a state of decay . <p> I stood on the front stoop of the real estate office , facing the town park , a grassy square roofed with skeletal sycamore trees and crisscrossed by footpaths . A central plaza served as a commemoration of our county 's warriors : a bronze statue of a Second World War soldier , aiming his rifle , lay prone in front of a granite slab bearing the chiseled names of the dead . Three benches faced the memorial , empty now save for an abandoned fast food bag which a large black crow listlessly pecked . <p> The park was the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest had changed for the worse . Gerrysburg was laid out on a grid of perfect right angles , with the park in the center . I strolled along the cracked and weedy sidewalks , and surveyed the damage . It was n't just the businesses I remembered that were gone now-in some cases it was the buildings that had housed them , as well . The movie theater and diner that used to reside on opposite corners of the park had been razed and replaced by parking lots , which now stood empty of cars , save for a single rusted pickup truck , its tailgate bearing a faded " Support Our Troops " magnetic ribbon . The dental clinic was still here , but appeared closed down , and had fallen into disrepair . Two of the three banks were gone , one intact but abandoned , one supplanted by a vacant lot . The former sandwich shop had been transformed into a pet store that was now boarded up , and the laundromat was closed . <p> A few businesses were open , though none appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of pornographic magazines , a doctor 's office , and an ice cream parlor . As I passed the ice cream parlor , a man walked out sipping a cup of coffee . He ignored me as he passed , but he was the only other pedestrian I 'd seen so far . I decided to go in . <p> The moment I crossed the threshold , I knew that I had been in this ice cream parlor before . The walls were white now , replacing the wood paneling I remembered , and the dark booths had given way to tables and chairs . But the freezer , with its curved glass surface , was in the right place , and beside it stood a heavyset girl of around twenty wearing a white apron . She smiled as I approached the counter . <p> " Here for coffee ? " she said . <p> " I was thinking ice cream , " I replied . " If that 's all right . " <p> It was late March , and still cold outside . But the girl said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ordered a double scoop of rum raisin in a sugar cone and surveyed the place as the girl prepared it . <p> Jeremy 's . That was the name printed in reverse on the front window . It did n't sound familiar . From the pressed-tin ceiling hung four fans , none of them turning . It seemed to me that I could remember them , spinning lazily on a summer 's day . I felt a disturbing vertigo and touched the counter for support . <p> " Those do n't work , " the clerk said , handing me my cone . " We could sure use them in the summer , though ! " <p> I paid her and sat down with my ice cream . It was delicious , but I soon grew cold and had to buy a cup of coffee to warm myself back up . While I sat sipping it , a man emerged from a back room and began to talk to the clerk . I thought I recognized him , but could n't place him . He was younger than I-perhaps forty-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hair was brown and gray , receding in the front , but in need of a cut at the back . He seemed agitated . <p> He walked out the front door , tossing his dirty apron on a chair . I heard the clerk sigh . After a moment , she picked it up and hung it on a coat rack . <p> " Is that man your boss ? " I asked . <p> " Yes , " she said , but seemed reluctant to say any more . <p> A few minutes later he returned , holding a paper envelope from the last remaining bank . I could n't resist . " Excuse me , " I said . <p> He stopped , surprised . When he spoke , his voice was deep , dry , and impatient . " Yes ? " <p> " I 'm wondering-is this the same ice cream parlor that was here in the sixties ? " <p> " Yes , " he said simply . His manner remained curt , but now he had grown curious . <p> " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was called Pernice 's . After my father , Donald Pernice . Are you from around here ? " <p> I remembered now-as a boy , this man had used to come in with his mother for a free treat . I recalled my high school days , passing the time here , saying hello to the pretty lady and her young son . " Yes , " I said . " My name is Eric Loesch . " <p> Perhaps it was simply that the man was distracted , or that I had interrupted a thought in progress . But when I spoke , his face seemed to tighten , and his eyes glazed over just a little , as if he 'd been transported to another place . After a moment , he blinked , and said , " Jeremy Pernice . " <p> " I remember you in here with your mother , when you were a boy . " <p> He gaped at me for a moment . " Is that so ? " <p> " She was a beautiful lady . Is she living ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry . " <p> He seemed to have nothing more to say , so I thanked him for the ice cream and coffee . He nodded in acknowledgment , but lingered a moment , his body half-turned to go , staring at me quizzically . I recognized in his manner the faint anxiety and uncertainty of a man thrown off his bearings , and I wondered if he would voice his puzzlement . Instead , he remained silent and still . <p> " You remember me , perhaps ? " I asked him . <p> " No , " he said quickly . " No . Just thinking of my mother . " <p> " Again , " I said , " I 'm sorry . " <p> His only response was a nod , and he disappeared through the kitchen door . <p> I fell asleep in the park and woke up cold . The wind had picked up , blowing from the west-northwest at more than twenty knots , and clouds were moving across the face of the sun . I smelled , faintly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumpster . The ice cream seemed to have curdled in my stomach , and I felt somewhat nauseated . I wished I had n't eaten it . <p> I heard a rustling to my left , and turned to find the crow I 'd seen earlier , perched on the opposite armrest . It stared at me with its dumb black eyes , holding a crust of hamburger roll in its beak . Its feathers were worn and patchy , and it had been banded , a stamped metal ring fastened around one of its spindly legs . " Shoo , " I said , but instead of flying off , it cocked its head and seemed to regard me with curiosity and imperiousness . It made a quick motion with its beak , releasing the bread and grabbing it again before it fell , a trick to strengthen its grip . It really was a huge bird-a raven , you might call it , in fact . <p> As I stared at it , a figure approached , and the bird took off , as if in slow motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bedsheet in the wind . It was the real estate agent , Jennifer , filling the space in my field of vision that the raven had occupied . She stopped a few feet from the bench , her hands on her hips , her feet spread apart , and said sternly , " I 'm ready . " <p> The land was located in the Town of Henford , at the northwestern corner of the county . On the drive there , the real estate agent turned to me and asked me a question . She was sitting in the passenger seat , dwarfed by my enormous SUV , her thick pale knees pressed together below the hem of a coarse green skirt . Her hands were stubby and rested on her lap , the left laid flat over the right . <p> She said , " So , what brings you back to Gerrysburg ? " <p> I had , in fact , been anticipating this question , and had spent the bulk of the drive so far attempting to formulate a reasonable answer . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my roots . <p> " Your parents . They still around here ? " <p> " In a sense . They 're buried here , " I said . " They died when I was still a young man . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Their names were Cybele and Brian Loesch , " I said . " They lived on Jefferson Street , where I grew up . " <p> She frowned . " Where 's that again ? " <p> " The west end of town , " I said . " I understand it 's where they put the new sports field for the high school . " <p> She paused before replying , " Oh , right . They never finished that . The high school got consolidated with Milan High . " She looked up at me . " I remember it when I was a kid . Them knocking the houses down . " <p> I nodded . " It was after my time . " <p> " I guess so . " <p> The village quickly gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the area 's misfortune were to continue for another fifty years , it would all be forest again , as it had doubtless been before it was settled by Europeans . The road weaved and lurched , following the hills , and I grimaced as my ill- considered morning snack shifted in my stomach . <p> Luckily it was not far to the plot of land . Jennifer held a survey map , which she turned this way and that , studying it , then peering out the window . " Okay , " she said , as we passed a road marked MINERVA . " I think this is it , maybe ? Starting on the left ? " <p> Even from my vantage point on the driver 's side , it was obvious that the plot of land began , in fact , on the right . Jennifer was holding the map upside down . I told her so , and she corrected her grip with a small grunt of acknowledgment . Clearly she was not the type to accept others ' authority with ease . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grade now ; the car began to climb . The land was heavily wooded , and unremarkable in every way . Yet the sight of it filled me with excitement and foreboding . I felt powerfully the rightness of the decision I had made to return here , and I gripped the steering wheel harder . <p> We rose gradually on the undulating pavement , and eventually came to a crossroads , the corner of LYSSA and PHOEBUS . There was a clearing here , and a white house , large and clapboarded , with drooping eaves . Saplings grew all around it , right up against the foundation . Beyond it the road sloped away , and in the far distance , outside the influence of the thick gray cloudbank that covered us , I could make out the glimmer of a lake . I drew to a stop on the shoulder . <p> " That 's the house , " Jennifer said . " Like I said , it needs work . On the other side of the street is Fordham County , and that 's Wanona Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful view , " I said . <p> " Yeah , I guess it is , " she replied , without enthusiasm . <p> We turned right and continued our journey around the property . From fallow spots along Phoebus Road it was possible , in places , to see over the trees and into the interior of the plot : gentle green swells of forest draining toward the village . Though the odometer indicated that we had covered very little distance , the journey seemed to be taking quite some time ; I gave the car a bit more gas . Eventually we reached a road called Nemesis and turned right onto it . <p> " The roads have unusual names , " I said . <p> She spoke with rote weariness . " The men who divided up the county named the roads after Greek gods , " she said . " They had this idea it was supposed to be some enlightened , you know , what do you call it . " <p> " Utopia ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it did n't pan out , anyway . " <p> A little while later the road ran over a culvert ; a corrugated pipe jutted out on either side , admitting a small creek . " Okay , " Jennifer said , " this corner is n't part of the property . The creek cuts it off . " A few moments later we came to Minerva Road and turned right yet again . We crossed over the creek a second time , and soon we were back to Phoebus . We retraced our route , returned to the upper corner of the land , and parked on the shoulder to take a closer look at the house . <p> The windows were cracked and dirty , and on the door hung a NO TRESPASSING sign . The yard bore evidence of once having been entirely covered with coarse gravel , through which rangy weeds now grew . We stepped onto a rickety wooden stoop , and Jennifer fumbled through a ring of keys . In a moment , the door opened with a creak , and we stepped inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior had been preserved . The walls were filthy , but the lath was intact , and the wide floorboards were tight and true , if scratched . Bare wires trailed out of ragged holes in the ceiling . Jennifer led me in silence from room to room . We walked slowly , gently , as if in an effort not to disturb someone or something that lived here-but of course there was nothing . The house was empty and forgotten . <p> The stairs creaked as we climbed to the second floor . There were not many rooms , but they were large and high-ceilinged , and the master bedroom was fully twenty feet square , with a bank of tall windows that , if cleaned and reglazed , would doubtless appear quite beautiful . The view north and east was spectacular . <p> " That would be the whole property , there , " Jennifer said , pointing . The land sloped gently away from us , and the village of Gerrysburg was visible in the distance through the dusty windows . But what drew the eye was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large gray outcropping of bare rock that jutted out from the carpet of trees . I made a quick judgment of the distance and determined that it had to be at least a hundred and twenty feet tall , if not more . <p> The sight of the rock moved and disturbed me . Its incongruousness here , the way it interrupted the gentle curve of the land , seemed like some kind of challenge or rebuke . It appeared much the way I imagined a great whale might , breaking the surface of a calm sea to draw a mighty breath ; and like a whale , its imposing nature enticed the viewer to conquer and claim it . I stroked my chin , to indicate to Jennifer that I was deep in thought . " Tell me about that rock , " I said . <p> " I suppose a glacier left it , " she replied , her voice echoing flatly in the empty room . Her arms were crossed and she hugged herself in the damp cold . <p> " It 's possible to reach it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out a snort of laughter . " If you buy the place , you can do whatever you want , " she said . " I 'm sure you could get there , it ca n't be more than half a mile . " <p> I nodded , as though considering . But I had seen enough . I turned to Jennifer . Her eyes widened , and the corner of her mouth twitched . I said , " I 'll take it . " <p> She scowled , blinking . " What , this place ? " <p> " Yes , " I laughed . " I 'll take it . The price seems reasonable to me . " <p> " You 're kidding . " <p> " No , I 'm not . It 's exactly what I 've been looking for . " <p> She stared at me , silently , seriously , judging . " Believe you me , " she said . " I would be totally happy to sell you it . But I just have to know if you have any idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to worry about me , " I said with a smile . <p> She seemed to soften , her features relaxing , her arms falling to her sides . She sighed . " Well , okay , whatever then . You can still change your mind . Come on back to the office and let 's get started . " <p> " Wonderful , " I said , and for a moment , I felt as though I should shake the agent 's hand , or engage her in a friendly embrace , something to commemorate the occasion . And perhaps sensing this , she quickly moved into the hallway ahead of me , and down the stairs to the door . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
