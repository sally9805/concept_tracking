Chapter One John fled up steep tiers of marble benches . Dusk had fallen over Constantinople . It was not dark enough to hide the hunted man . The setting sun filled the Hippodrome with light the color of blood in water . The long shadows of the pursuers grasped at his heels . The distorted shape of a helmet sprang up in front of him , then bobbed away . The excubitors were closing ground . John glanced back . One line of guards snaked directly behind . Others climbed along the seating on either side , intent on cutting off his escape . Above his head loomed the ornately sculpted facade of the imperial box . As Lord Chamberlain , John knew those seats were inaccessible to the easily inflamed crowds . He was just as familiar with the area directly below , used by the emperor 's servants , musicians , and guards . As he reached the chest-high wall of the enclosure and pulled himself over , a spear hissed by his ear and rattled down onto the marble floor . He thanked Mithra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leapt through the doorway into darkness and plunged headlong down a sloping corridor . The sound of the pursuit echoed along the passageway as he emerged into the Hippodrome 's concourse . Abeautiful , monstrous face below upraised wings smiled down at him . Dying sunlight flickered in the blank eyes . John ran past the statue and outside . He was at the lower end of the Hippodrome . The shops lining its curved wall were closed , their gratings chained to rings in the pavement . He sprinted past them , keeping in the shadows as much as possible . A hoarse shout told him he 'd been spotted . He dodged into a colonnaded street . And fell . The sprawled figure whose outstretched leg had tripped him winked . No . Not a wink . Just a bloated fly skittering across the corpse 's wide open eye . John pushed himself upright . A ragged line of bodies in the middle of the street meandered to an overturned cart . Plague victims . Whatever the cause of the accident , the authorities had not picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran . Then , abruptly , the street dropped away . Below , John recognized the flickering lights of ships . The docks . There was nowhere else to run . The guards at the imperial granary were intent on a game of knucklebones when the tall , lean man in a dark cloak burst into their midst . Before they could react , John was past them . He reached the interior courtyard , veered through the nearest door , and raced along a dim hallway lined with narrow , rectangular alcoves-waist-high grain bins . The hallway intersected others with similar receptacles . John zigzagged through the corridors . Skylights admitted only faint illumination . Rats scuttled out of his path . Many of the bins were empty , others barely half full . The plague had disrupted everything , including the food supply . His way was barred by a heaped grain bin that closed off the end of the corridor . This then was the one Mithra had chosen . John climbed in and burrowed under the grain . He pressed himself against the front wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathe . The scrape and susurration of his effort gave way to a smothering silence . He fought off panic . The suffocating darkness was too much like being under water . Loud footsteps approached . " What do you mean where ? Use your eyes ! " someone said nearby . John knew that voice . " Here . Give me your spear , " the man said . John took shallow breaths . He strained to hear through the cloak and the stifling weight of the grain . There was a dull thud , followed by silence and another thud . The pattern of sounds was repeated . " Do the same with the others , " came the order . John understood . His pursuers were thrusting spears into the grain piled in the bins . There came the occasional scrape as a spear was deflected by a bin wall . Several curses . Footsteps . Someone emitted a coarse laugh . Soon they would reach the bin in which John hid . Each inhalation drew the fabric of the cloak toward his mouth , cutting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " complained an excubitor . " What 's your hurry ? Is Theodora waiting for you in the barracks ? " Now they were in front of John 's bin . He felt the grain move against his hip as the spear passed over and clashed against the back wall . A grunt . Then flames seared John 's shoulder . He 'd been grazed . He had uttered no sound . Would they notice blood on the spear ? Not in the near darkness . " No one 's in there either . " The men began to move away . " Wait ! Three times . Those were the orders . " The man addressed grumbled obscenely . Again the spear sliced into the grain . There was a piercing shriek . Rough hands grabbed John 's arms and yanked him upwards . The screams rose into a gurgling screech . A rat writhed and bled on the end of the spear . Then the voice John recognized ordered the captive be bound . " In the name of the emperor , I arrest you for murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of John 's oldest friends . He stared at John in astonishment . " John .... Lord Chamberlain . I 'm certain there is an explanation ? " John said nothing , but his gaze flickered briefly towards the floor . No one at a distance would have noticed . When Felix looked down , John quickly traced four lines in the dust with the toe of his boot . His expression remained stony . " Captain , you see the situation . I know you will do your duty . I expect to be escorted to an imperial dungeon immediately . " Chapter Two " We shall be merciful and allow you to keep one eye . We would not wish you to be unable to see what is in store after the torturers begin their work . " Theodora 's mouth curved into a scarlet scimitar . A smile of anticipation . John gazed over her head at the opposite wall of the torch-lit cell . He was chained naked to damp stones . Although he avoided looking at his visitor , he could not escape her musk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweat . He imagined she had been roused from sleep and instructed her ladies-in-waiting to dress her in the first robes that came to hand . Theodora selected a pair of bloodstained pincers from a wooden table upon which were ranged a variety of instruments , many resembling physicians ' tools . Her sharp , experimental click of the pincers drew John 's unwilling attention . Theodora set the tool down and picked up a wooden-handled razor . " Think of the damage this keen edge will do . " She looked John up and down . He could feel her gaze crawling over his body with a thousand insect-like legs . " You are in fine physical condition . You will endure longer than most , once the work begins . Unfortunately for you , Lord Chamberlain . " She sighed . " That sounds like such an inappropriate title for one in your circumstances . Perhaps I should call you what the people in the streets do-John the Eunuch . Such a pity the Persians began our work for us . I am not without mercy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you prefer to lose your eyes or ... but that is an opportunity I can not offer you . I give them a week to ponder the decision , just to be fair . What would you have chosen ? Your eyes ? " John made no reply . " Such a shame , " Theodora continued . " I should have enjoyed seeing ... but there are other possibilities . The skin can be removed piece by piece for some time before oblivion . Did you know that ? Then again , we might do better not to pollute the flagstones with your blood , but rather break your bones one by one instead . " She tested the razor 's edge with a slender fingertip . " This is sharp enough to have been used by a tonsor . Do you suppose the razor that trims the beard longs for the flesh of the throat ? So near ... but I notice you are strangely silent . You will soon have ample opportunity to test your discretion . I shall order that your inquisition be completed before your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , highness . " Rage flared in Theodora 's eyes . She lifted the blade . For an instant he thought she intended to slash him . Instead she struck him across the face with the flat of the blade . A thread of blood trickled down the concavity of John 's cheek . " You murdered a senator ! Why ? There is a reason and I will have it ! Not even you can thwart me . It will be an interesting interview tomorrow and I look forward to it . Do n't think you can escape our justice by biting off your tongue and choking yourself . You will be watched . You are a practical man and know your life is already forfeit . Why make whatever remains of it any more painful than it must be ? " John was silent . Theodora 's dark eyes glittered . " Very well . If you remain stubborn , I shall order the women in your household brought here . That one you call your wife ... my servants will be able to offer her more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will witness it all . " She emitted a coarse laugh and opened the cell door . " Good night , dear Lord Chamberlain . While you 're waiting for sunrise , you can consider what I 've told you and count the passing hours until our next conversation . " * * * As the door closed behind the empress , John allowed himself a thin smile . Then he leaned back against the rough stones . The scent of the empress remained , vanishingly faint yet discernable , an incongruous contrast to the malodor of the stuffy room . His thoughts were not for himself but his family . His daughter Europa and her mother Cornelia , who had ill-advisedly set foot in this city where the scent of the empress who hated John was always in the air . There was also his daughter 's new husband . That reckless fool Thomas . What would they make of it all ? What would they do now ? The door squealed open . Two unfamiliar excubitors entered , removed his chains , threw a rough tunic over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor . Other guards waited . He looked around , thinking he glimpsed Felix in the shadows at the back of the group . Strong hands forced his face forward . " Watch where you 're going ! " A sword pommel jabbed hard in the back emphasized the curt instruction . John was led along twisting passages , past nail-studded , iron-banded doors pierced with rusty , barred grates , up steep staircases , down , and along more corridors lined by other cell doors , then up once again . The measured tramp of his escorts ' boots did not stir the black veil of darkness lying beyond the reach of their torches . The party emerged into a soaring , echoing space he recognized as one of the emperor 's reception halls . It was not yet dawn . Tall windows held only a gray glow . Terra cotta lamps strewn across the dark marble floor illuminated the hall with hundreds of trembling flames . John had the impression of gazing down at the lights of a city . Smoke coiled up into a haze through which twinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawn in gold and precious stones on the vaulted ceiling . At a hoarse command-he recognized Felix 's voice-the excubitors came to a halt . Firm hands pushed him onward , into a curving lane of darkness between the lamps , leading toward a mountainous ivory throne from which Jupiter might preside . Or Jupiter and Juno , for there were two seats . An indistinct group of figures moved in the smoke swirling behind the throne . John 's keen eye caught a brief flash of gems on the hem of a cloak . The emperor ? The wearer 's pale , phantom visage coalesced for a heartbeat . John could not say whether it was smoke , his imagination , or the flickering light , but the face did not quite attain human form before it dissipated into darkness . The misshapen , inhuman image floated in John 's memory after the vision itself had vanished . He recalled wild tales told in the city . They claimed Justinian was a faceless demon who never slept but instead stalked the halls of the Great Palace all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows , his face not demonic , but as bland and round as a country farmer . " Lord Chamberlain ! Take care you do n't trip ! I do not usually receive visitors at this time of the night , but the lamps are kept lit for our nocturnal strolls . The emperor should never be kept in the dark . " He spoke softly , his words intended only for John . John said nothing . " You are not in a humorous mood ? But why should you be ? Murder is always a vexatious matter , and the killing of a senator .... It has been a busy night . You realize you have given me no choice ? Innocent men do not flee . That 's what everyone at the palace will be whispering . One can think of a thousand reasons why a Lord Chamberlain might kill , but not a single one why he should then run away as if he were some common criminal . " Justinian waved his hand in exasperation . The movement of his heavy sleeve made the flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . " Powerful men may do what they wish , provided they are discreet , " he went on . " For the emperor to pardon a man who has so plainly admitted his guilt ... there would be grumbling , which so often leads to unrest . And what would the Patriarch say ? There is nothing I can do but exile you . " Although Justinian was already speaking quietly he lowered his reedy voice further before adding , " I see you grasped your opportunity , John . Well done . " " I did not kill Symacchus , Caesar . " " Oh , I 'm not concerned about that . The important thing is you have arranged matters most conveniently . " " You will send me to Egypt ? " " Of course . Perhaps there you will find the answer that has thus far eluded you here in the city . " " It is difficult to investigate here without disturbing the empress , " John admitted . " You are aware the empress has a strong Christian interest in justice being done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , for a start . " " Have you elicited any new information regarding the situation in Egypt , excellency ? I appreciate your informant has been vague , nevertheless , with so little known so far I have been chasing phantoms . " " Better that than faceless demons , would n't you agree ? " John gave a slight nod . " My spies have given me the name of a certain landowner . A fellow called ... ah ... the name escapes me . Strange to relate , I granted him an audience in this very hall . There could n't have been more than a hundred other petitioners that day . Last year ? Or was it before the riots ? I believe the man 's father also once visited the capital . Something involving taxation or possibly a property dispute . In any event , the family is not entirely unknown to me . " " Do they reside in Alexandria ? " " No . The settlement is some distance up the river . Most of Egypt is up the river , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me-whoever they are-appear to believe there is something important to their cause in Egypt , and this location appears to be the place to begin your investigation . " He handed John an official document burdened by the heavy imperial seal . " This is your letter of introduction . One more thing . I have just learnt there have been a number of mysterious deaths on this man 's estate . They should serve you as a starting gate . " John peered into the emperor 's face . There seemed no life in the small eyes , except that lent to them by the lamplight 's exaggerated shadows . He might have been examining a mask . " These deaths are mysterious , Caesar ? " " Oh yes , like nothing I have ever heard before . The man 's sheep , although guarded and locked in a barn , are beheading themselves . " Chapter Three Suicidal sheep ? No sooner had Justinian imparted this information than he ordered John escorted from the reception hall . The party marched briskly away . Their route took them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warren of whitewashed walls punctuated by the dark doorways of empty rooms . From the entrance to one cubbyhole , where a lamp burned at a desk piled high with parchment , a pallid clerk peered out at them with the huge eyes of a startled nocturnal creature . As the company turned a corner and exited into a small , tree-girded garden , John heard giggles . The sound turned to shrieks as three gaudily costumed court pages , who clearly had no business there , threw twigs and abuse at the excubitors and then raced away into the shrubbery . The first red light of dawn illuminated the colonnade under which they walked . The harsh complaints of seagulls and a swelling chorus of birds greeted another day . Mist steamed off the dark vegetation . ( Continues ... )
