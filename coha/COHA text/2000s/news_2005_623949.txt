<p> Numerous books survey Henri Matisse 's paintings , drawings and sculpture in reproduction , but none paid proper attention to the artist 's life before Hilary Spurling completed her involving , sympathetic two-volume biography . <p> Matisse the Master : A Life of Henri Matisse , the Conquest of Colour , 1909-1954 ( Knopf ; 512 pages ; $40 ) posed challenges very different from those of Spurling 's Vol. 1 . It contains so few images that readers might want to wade into it with one of the great pictorial compendia , such as Pierre Schneider 's 1984 " Matisse , " close at hand . <p> The first third of Matisse 's long career centered on his defiance of an imperious , philistine father and his rise from provincial merchant 's son and failed lawyer to an embattled figure of the Parisian artistic avant-garde . <p> Spurling ended her first volume with a vindication of Matisse 's apparent retreat from his early radical style , dubbed Fauvism by its hostile critics , which liberated color at the expense of other pictorial values . Nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Spurling , that forced Matisse 's sudden turn to a more marketable manner : a financial scandal implicating his in-laws that had national repercussions in France . <p> Spurling tracks the drama of Matisse 's maturity concurrently in three registers : the studio , family life and the violent background of 20th century Europe 's upheavals . She executes this tricky counterpoint beautifully . <p> Throughout the second volume , Spurling works to offset the hard-won impression Matisse 's paintings can give of a man reveling in the private pleasures of creativity , unmoved by a world in tumult around him . " His deepest instinct in the face of erupting violence and destruction , " she writes , " was to respond with an affirmation of everything that made life worth living . " <p> Meanwhile , " when painting tormented him , " Spurling writes , " he vented his frustration on anyone or anything that came or seemed to come between him and his work . It brought out a side of him that was exacting , jealous and possessive . ... He demanded too much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other people . " <p> Matisse 's uncompromising temperament helped him attain some of the summits of 20th century visual art , but the effort also cost him his health and finally his decades-long second marriage . <p> Spurling traces the harrowing course of Matisse 's emotional and artistic impasses , and their transcendence , through the family correspondence , to which she had unprecedented access . She also interviewed , more extensively than anyone else had , Lydia Delectorskaya , the secretary and occasional model who effectively supplanted Matisse 's wife , even before the spouses ' late-life separation , as manager of his studio , his finances and his precarious health . <p> A telegram from Matisse in Nice to his friend and confidant Simon Bussy , living nearby in Rocquebrune , gives a taste of the urgency that pervades much of the correspondence Spurling cites . At the time Matisse found himself deadlocked with the mural panels he had undertaken on commission from the American collector Albert C. Barnes , a project whose frustrations nearly brought the artist and his martinet patron to blows . " DECORATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COMPOSITION COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND AM IN DESPAIR LIGHT SUITABLE THIS AFTERNOON FOR GOD 'S SAKE COME AT ONCE MATISSE . " <p> Even without her insight into specific paintings , both familiar and obscure , Spurling 's biography would prepare the reader to feel the chilling force of the doubt that Matisse expressed to Picasso in one of their last encounters . " In a generation or two , " Matisse wondered , " who among the painters will still carry a part of us in his heart , as we do Manet and Cezanne ? " <p> True to Matisse 's anxiety , the fate of painting as an art seems to rest in fewer and fewer hands as time passes . The unsparing realist Lucian Freud , now 83 , makes almost everyone 's list . <p> Lucian Freud , 1996-2005 by Sebastian Smee ( Knopf ; $75 ) surveys the phenomenal output of Freud 's past decade . <p> Grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis , Freud has placed himself in the lineage of disillusioning European realism that connects Velasquez , Courbet , Manet , Adolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which his sitters knowingly submit , appears driven by an insistence upon flesh , uniqueness and mortality as human truths to which only direct observation and a handmade artifact  --  a painting , or a drawing on an etching plate  --  can aspire to bear witness . <p> Freud 's nudes have a particularly confrontational vividness . But under his gaze , everything  --  a face , a chair , a room  --  appears denuded of something , unless it is the viewer 's perception that he strips bare . Paradoxically , Freud 's late pictures wear callused hides of worked pigment that even the best reproductions barely evoke . <p> Cy Twombly , 76 , stands near the opposite end from Freud of a continuum between realism and improvised abstraction . <p> No single book , not even the New York Museum of Modern Art 's 1994 retrospective catalog , presents a broader , brighter visual record of Twombly 's flamboyant art than Cy Twombly : A Monograph by French art historian Richard Leeman ( Flammarion/Rizzoli ; translated by Mary Whittall ; 323 pages : $125 ) . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richness of text and imagery . <p> Leeman 's chapter headings  --  " Destroying Painting , " " A Mythography of Longing , " " A Theory of Whirlwinds "  --  suggest his interpretive flair , but no commentator before him has plumbed so deeply the literary sources and content of Twombly 's art , with the painter 's cooperation . <p> Critics , collectors and curators of photography have long needed The Oxford Companion to the Photograph ( edited by Robin Lenman ; Oxford University Press ; 769 pages ; $65 ) . It combines in a single volume historical , biographical , critical and technical information on an astounding array of topics . <p> Think of the most obscure photographic subject you have ever encountered . Fresson process ? Lomography ? Opalotype ? All here , along with countless unlikely entries such as " bullfight photography , " " Noir Limite " and " oyaji . " Numerous images in color and black and white illustrate the book . Eighteen advisory editors and dozens of other authoritative contributors make it an indispensable addition to every art library . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief entry in the massive The Oxford Companion . But he is luckier still to be honored with a luxurious new survey of 30 years ' work , Richard Misrach : Chronologies ( Fraenkel Gallery/D.A.P. ; 280 pages ; $85 ) . <p> Co-edited by Misrach and his San Francisco dealer , Jeffrey Fraenkel , the book forgoes text to let the images alone speak of Misrach 's restless search for the most striking possible balance between social implication and formal power . Horizonless shots of empty sky , his most abstract , appear to ignore social facts in favor of color fields presented by nature . But the title of each one contains exact details of time , date and location that set viewers searching their own memories of contemporaneous events . The book records few creative missteps and has only the inevitable shortcoming of misrepresenting the relative sizes of Misrach 's prints . It reveals an artist of impressive dedication and maturity . <p> So does one of the season 's smallest significant photography books , The Invented Camera ( introduction by Bill Berkson ; essay by Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Bay Area photographer Jo Babcock took to the limit the fact that any hollow object can potentially serve as a camera . " The Invented Camera " pairs images of Babcock 's cameras , including a Brillo box , a VW van and several suitcases , with pictures he took using them . Conceptual photography with a heart . <p> Cuban-born photographer Abelardo Morell applied the " Babcock principle " to hotel rooms , producing some of the images collected in his first monograph , in which pale , inverted cityscapes blanket walls and furniture like dreams adrift from their dreamers . Abelardo Morell by Richard B. Woodward ( Phaidon ; 140 pages ; $49.95 ) records a sustained photographic meditation on things that try to objectify imagination , from books and their illustrations to the camera itself . <p> The art world buzz about a revival of drawing has begun to subside already , but those who wondered what it was about can find out from Vitamin D : New Perspectives in Drawing ( Phaidon ; introduction by Emma Dexter ; 352 pages ; $69.95 ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , generous enough to induce amazement at what " drawing " has become . <p> Finally , a recommendation for the art library that has everything : Artists ' Estates : Reputations in Trust ( edited by Magda Salvesen and Diane Cousineau ; Rutgers ; 384 pages ; $34.95 ) . <p> This collection of interviews with the custodians of artists ' estates , including those of Mark Rothko , David Park , Fairfield Porter and Romare Bearden , opens a treasury of anecdote , cautionary tales and practical advice . The book fills a void in the literature that only those confronting it have recognized until now .
