Bean 's Microlight ( Outfitting , August 1998 ) delivers twin peak vents and a taut , full-coverage rainfly that handled a mini-blizzard on the Grand Canyon 's South Rim , plus dozens .. of nights of desert and summer camping . Plentiful mesh and hoop-tent design keep trail weig to less than 5 pounds . Fast And Light Our initial tests of Mountain Hardwear 's Tri Light 2 ( $325 ) have us marveling at the tent 's space-to-weight ratio . There 's plenty of elbowroom for two , plus space for gear and enough length for sub-6 footers , yet the whole enchilada weighs just more than 4 pounds . Full mesh walls keep air moving , making muggy nights in the Northwest more comfy , but dry fall evenings back East a bit chilly .

Numerous small details , like the ingenious headlamp hole in the Titan 's gear attic , make the living easy . Hot-Weather Haven Tug two zippers on The North Face Peregrine ( Outfitting , June 1999 ) , and a pair of huge picture windows open so wide you 'll forget you 're in a tent . Both ventilation and weather-tightness were outstanding during a 2-week Grand Canyon trip in this 7-plus pound ( according to BACKPACKER scales ) tent ( $319 . Rainy-Day Refuge The $230 Kelty Vortex 2 excels as a rain refuge because you 'll have it pitched quicker than you can say " rain , rain go away .

High-Mountain Hotel Offering a nearly ideal balance of weight and space for a double-wall mountain tent , the Sierra Designs Tiros AST ( $425 ) has endured raging storms on Washington 's Mt . Rainier and other high peaks , barely shaking or making a noise in winds that bent poles on other tents . Stay tuned for a review of new features that are intended to make this and other Sierra Designs tents even more stable . Solo Special With headroom to spare and plenty of length , the Marmot Eclipse ( $199 ) earned our 6 ' 6 ' tester 's praise as the " ideal solo for tall guys " ( " Room For One , " May 1999 ) . He found ample space , ventilation , and weatherproofing in this one-person shelter during rainy , windy trips from New York 's Adirondack Mountains to Montana 's Glacier National Park . USAGE Summer/screen ( SU ) . Designed for moderate rainstorms and maximum ventilation in steamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lightest of shelters . Screen tents do n't handle high winds or blowing sand or snow well , but that 's the price you pay for their light weight . Three-season ( TS ) . These popular tents usually have two to four poles , fullcoverage rainflies , small vestibules , and enough interior space for the shorter nights and brief storms of spring , summer , and fall . Most three-season tents can handle reasonably gusty winds and heavy rain , but not heavy snow loads . These shelters usually have plenty of mesh in the interior canopy for venting in hot , humid climes . Convertible ( CV ) . Convertibles are hybrid tents that come with pole , window , vestibule , and/or rainfly options that let you strip the tent down for casual summer trips or bulk it up for stormy winter adventures . In warmer weather , you can leave a pole or vestibule at home to cut weight and unzip the screen panels to increase ventilation . In winter , the optional poles beef up the canopy against snow loads and wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for folks who want only one tent for everything . Mountaineering/high altitude ( MI ) . These tents have tougher fabrics and pole structures , roomier interiors , heavier weights , and stiffer prices than other tent styles , but they 'll shelter you against the worst winter or mountain conditions . Most have at least four " main " poles to handle snow and wind , and large vestibules to store lots of winter gear and allow for stormy-weather cooking . Tarp ( TA ) . With a shaped , waterproof rainfly and a collapsible pole ( or trekking  --  pole adaptor ) to supply support , tarp tents offer basic shelter from wind and rain . A tarp is only as good as its setup , though . With some practice , you 'll get a good shelter with a remarkably high space-to  --  weight ratio . Some have add-on mesh inner tents . TYPE A-frame ( AF ) . Simple , light , and often inexpensive , A-frame designs require staking . Their slanting walls limit elbow- and headroom . Modified A-frame ( MAF ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved sidewalls create more interior space and structural stability than a standard Aframe has . Some are freestanding . Dome ( DO ) . Domes come in a broad spectrum of shapes , sizes , and pole configurations . They feature flexible poles that overlap in symmetrical ( or nearly so ) patterns to create taut fabric panels and a streamlined shape that can handle strong winds . Their arched ceilings increase headand elbowroom , but some of the " rounder " hexagonal or octagonal floor plans are too short for taller campers . Domes require minimal staking for weather resistance , but are prone to blowing away if not secured . Most three-season domes have three arching poles to support the living quarters ( some tents include additional poles to support the vestibule ) , while winter domes feature four or more poles . Because of the abundance of poles and fabric required to make a freestanding dome , these shelters tend to weigh more than comparably sized hoop or tepee tents . Hoop ( HO ) . Shaped liked frontier-era covered wagons , hoop tents typically feature easy setup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-season designs have only two hoops , which leaves large swaths of fabric vulnerable to high winds . Other hoop tents add a third ( middle ) pole across the tent body and numerous guypoints , qualifying them for winter use . Three-season hoop tents are very popular with long-distance hikers who want to spend more time making miles than hanging out in their tent ; some can be pitched without the inner canopy for ultralight travel . Pyramid/tepee ( PY ) . These floorless , minimalist shelters that shed wind , rain , and moderate snow consist of a shaped , waterproof rainfly supported by an upright center pole , often assembled from trekking or ski poles . They 're lightweight , but totally reliant on good staking , and they offer little defense against bugs . A few are available with optional floors . Freestanding ( FS ) . Most domes and some modified A-frames do n't require staking to keep them from collapsing ( though their vestibules usually do require stakes ) . This means easier pitching , drying , and cleaning . To get the tautest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the tent . And unoccupied freestanding tents have been known to blow away if not secured against wind gusts . Single-wall ( SW ) . Traditional " double-wall " tents have a canopy-and-fly design . Single-wall shelters feature just one fabric layer , a waterproof/breathable laminate . They are mostly for high  --  mountain and snow use , and tend to be light , compact , and easily pitched compared to double-wall models . Rain , heat , and fog tend to cause condensation in many single-wall tents , so look for vents . The best single-wall tents are seam-taped ; those that are n't require zealous sealing and maintenance . CAPACITY This number , supplied by the manufacturer , represents how many average-size hikers can comfortably sleep inside . Before you purchase a tent , crawl in and lie down , with your partner if possible . In some " two-person " tents , two sleeping pads wo n't fit side by side without overlapping . POLES The perfect backpacking tent pole would be light and quickly pitched or stored , but at the same time , strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracturing . Aluminum ( AL ) and high-strength aluminum ( HA ) are the most widely used materials , with the high-strength versions ( series 7000 or 2000 ) having the best strength-to-weight ratios . Carbon fiber ( CF ) is very light , but expensive . Some lower-cost tents use tubular fiberglass ( TF ) , which is cheaper but weaker , more brittle , and prone to splintering in cold weather . Solid fiberglass ( SF ) poles come with some cheaper tents . They are heavier and less reliable than the tubular version . Since solid fiberglass poles require raised ferrules ( connectors ) to connect , they are more difficult to thread through pole sleeves . Some tents do n't include poles ; instead , you pitch them with your trekking poles . On the charts , a zero in the poles column indicates such a tent . A pole 's diameter has a bearing on its strength and performance , with thicker poles usually being the strongest , stiffest , and heaviest . Pole diameters for backpacking tents typically range from 8.5 to 9.5 millimeters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thicker poles , often tubular aluminum . Sometimes , a tent will have lighter poles in an area like the vestibule , where the stresses are less . FLOOR SPACE/LAYOUT A tent 's floor layout and interior shape determine your comfort level as you sleep or hide from the weather . They also affect if and where you 'll stash gear , and how you 'll maneuver around your tentmates . The floor space measurement is the raw square footage within the tent 's perimeter ( according to the manufacturer ) and gives a rough sense of the tent 's roominess . A twoperson model with 42 square feet of floor space , for example , is slightly roomier than average . Since tents lose real living space to slanting walls , low ceilings , and tight corners , do n't rely solely on the figures . Always crawl inside and check it out yourself . A hexagonal layout ( HX ) is a common " footprint " for dome tents . It provides ample space next to you for small items , but the " rounder " layouts can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some modified domes use rectangular ( RE ) floor plans . They let most folks stretch out without touching the ends of the tent , but offer limited storage space . Square ( SQ ) floors are found in group-size tents , where a number of hikers can sleep side by side . Some tents feature trapezoidal , irregular diagonal , or other shapes ( OS ) . INTERIOR HEIGHT This is the maximum ceiling height in inches . Remember , this usually is measured only at the apex . Slanting walls can make the number an illusion , even if it is technically accurate . Fast Pitch The Bibler Megamid ( 3 pounds 8 ounces , $178 ) took top honors in our fast-pitch contest . This tepee tent has only a center pole to pop up and four corners to stake out , which puts you just 45 seconds away from a dry shelter , according to testers who braved consistently foul weather while testing tepees in Washington 's North Cascades for an upcoming review Single-Wall Select We 've yet to use the new Bibler Ahwahnee 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-wall shelters ( " Tents From On High , " December 1997 ) . Light ( 5 pounds 2 ounces ) , but expensive ( then $750 , now $698 ) , it offered palatial living space and bombproof weatherproofing wrapped in a stitched-with  --  care package . Ventilation , one of many features that earned high marks , proved exceptional on Oregon 's stormy Mt . Hood . VESTIBULE A vestibule is like a toolshed or mudroom at your tent 's door , a transition zone you can duck into in bad weather to shed your boots and raingear , thereby keeping the inner tent dry . Almost always floorless , it also serves as a storage area for gear or a protected nook for cooking . The designation indicates whether a vestibule is standard ( S ) , optional ( 0 ) , or unavailable ( N ) . The number indicates the square footage of the vestibule 's footprint ; two numbers indicate there are two vestibules , either at the front and back or on the sides .

Neither howling winds and snow on the rim of Oregon 's Hells Canyon nor days of rain in the Northwest put a dent in this tent ( $349 ) . Top Tarp The ultraversatile Walrus Trekker Tarp earned an Editors ' Choice Award ( April 2000 ) for its front door-cum-awning , fast setup , and detachable mesh inner canopy , an option that let us sleep soundly in buggy and subfreezing conditions . Two trekking poles support the fly , creating a structure that easily shed gusting winds when guyed tightly and offered ample room for three hikers plus gear . The price$92 buys you the tarp and insert-is also outstanding . Bargain-Hunter 's Special For a measly $99 , the 20 deg F Marmot Wind River delivers the warmth and durability of Polarguard HV , all the features you expect in a more expensive bag , like an effective draft tube and two-way locking zipper , plus topnotch Marmot quality .

" Wiggler 's Choice Sierra Designs wins the " contortionist 's favorite " award for the men 's Deep Sleep and women 's Good Night OF bags ( $275 ) , which have elastic ribbing between the baffles that allows 3 inches of stretch in the shoulders and waist and an inch in the footbox ( " Shiver Stoppers , " February 2001 ) . The stretch adds weight , but active sleepers may not mind . These bags are also available in other temperature ratings . Best Bivy Two hoops , a high ceiling , and three-layer Gore-Tex construction push The North Face 's Trek Bivy ( $299 ) beyond the body-bag syndrome to a roomier , better-ventilated solo shelter that 'll accommodate big or little sleepers , plus some gear . " It 's a strong choice for go-light soloists , " said our tester ( Outfitting , June 2000 ) . <p>
