The social season is in high gear , the midwinter blues are setting in , and our fashion insider has a bit of a meltdown . By Lynn Hirschberg // By 8:45 , I knew it was hopeless . The invitation had called for cocktails at 7:00 , dinner at 8:00 , and the gala an event I had been looking forward to for at least a week-was a half hour away by taxi . I was sunk , unless I dressed immediately , but the idea of efficiency  --  of actually zipping up a gown , matching a bag , and slipping on some shoes in a reasonable amount of time-was an alien concept well beyond my comprehension . I looked around my bedroom for answers . Strewn on every surface were lovely dresses and beautiful slingbacks and all sorts of stuff that should have been perfect , should have been at least fine , but somehow were just not . I was paralyzed . Just hours ago , I had been a different person . I had pulled three gowns from my crammed closet : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruffled hem ; another Galanos with layers of blue , green , and purple silk that feels a little toga-like ; and a silver iridescent Paco Rabanne with a geometric pattern that is one of those garments that always inspires the question " Have you lost weight ? " With all these gowns , I had definite ideas about which wrap , which purse , which shoes . I had plenty of time to organize my hair and get dressed . I was set . Perhaps I 'd had too much time , too big a window for analysis , meaning that , eventually , doubt gave way to complete disgust . I had curled my hair , put on excellent underwear ( which , of course , would not , in all likelihood , be seen by my fellow gala attendees and was therefore not subject to scrutiny ) . When I tried on the brown chiffon Galanos , I decided it was too frilly and seemed to want a pair of castanets . The next Galanos did n't seem to fit properly , and the Paco Rabanne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convinced that none of these dresses would suit the evening , I started to rummage through my closet . It was a frenzy of dismay : The pale-green strapless was too summery ; the pink Pauline Trigere too sheer ; the kelly-green Norell was n't sexy enough ; the forest-green beaded was too formal . Finally , I thought of what my friend Amanda would do in a panic : Go for black . I tried on four different black dresses , and all of them seemed funereal . It was getting close to 8:00 and my hair was starting to go limp from all the dresses bashing against my curls . The phone rang-it was a friend calling on his cell from the party . " Where are you ? " he asked . " You 'd better get down here . I think you 're sitting next to George Clooney at dinner . " Whether this was true or not , I will never know . I was incapable of getting dressed and consequently did not leave the house until around 11:00 Pm. , and by then I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking the dog . I 've spent hundreds of hours shopping to avoid moments like these , hundreds of hours imagining the right dress in the right scenario . And then , no dress or gown or purse or even shoe would soothe my sense of fashion anxiety . By 9:00 Pm. , I had left phone messages for my hosts , started writing an apologetic note in my head ( " Alas , I could not get dressed .... " ) , and began the long , depressing process of putting everything away . An hour later , my closet finally restored to order , I was completely perplexed by my fashion meltdown . The brown Galanos would have been lovely , I thought as I smoothed out its ruffles . This was not my first night of indecision . A few years ago , I 'd had a similar episode on the way to my office Christmas party . Nothing seemed right-it was either too froufrou or not froufrou enough . I ended up spending the evening in fishnet stockings and a bra watching TV . I also recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to a suit that looked too starchy or a dress that suddenly seemed too bright . This , I thought , is why black is so popular . Even if it 's all wrong , you know you 'll blend . Part of my clothing anxiety has to do with what I view as the power of fashion . I believe that the way I 'm dressed can completely change my experience at any event . If tonight , for instance , I wear the perfect dress to dinner , my evening will be magical . If I do n't , if my bag is better suited for a trek in the Andes and my shoes are too tall , I 'm certain my mood will be similarly off . When considering a new garment , I always try to figure out who I will be when it 's on my body . Will I be chatting effortlessly at a cocktail party in this purple sheath ? Or will I merely look like a clown ? There 's the constant dialogue : I want clothes that conjure up a thrilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted with the reality of actual dressing , that world can seem far , far away . Photograph Stage fright When a little indecision leads to major fashion jitters . // Short of adopting a uniform , there has to be a solution . I do , after all , have to rid myself of gnawing self-doubt , The most important element is speed , as in , I can not give myself more than 20 minutes to dress . Hair and lipstick are an additional 10 minutes , and then I must leave . If I allot more than half an hour , there is a good chance that , two hours later , instead of making the date I will be contemplating a large pile of clothes . My sister believes that after three costume changes , you should go back to your first outfit and wear it , no matter what . " You always have an idea of what to wear , " she says . " You have a color in mind , a certain look . " She 's probably right . Tonight , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've pulled out two outfits : a Trigere plum wool dress and a more ornate brocade Malcolm Starr in gold , orange , and black . Both have matching coats , but one-the brocade-is much more of a showstopper . Last night , when I decided on these dresses , I favored the brocade . It was late on a Sunday night , I was feeling restless , and I wanted the kind of big-moment attention a dress like that might garner . Today , I 'm feeling more workaday Monday and less in need of attention , and I 'm leaning toward the Trigere . I can already see the problem looming . The movie is at 7:00 PM . Around 6:00 , I 'll start to go back and forth with pictures in my head : Should I he the glamour girl in brocade or the chic but understated girl in plum ? Or ( worst of all ) is there some third ( or fourth or fifth or ... ) image that I may not have yet considered ? Enough . Clothes are wonderful , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house . My inability to pick a dress cost me the chance to sit next to George Clooney , which , I 'm certain , would have been more riveting than a night spent organizing my closet . What , again , was so bad about any of the 10 gowns I discarded ? At the moment , I have no idea , but then I can completely understand what might not be quite right about either of my two planned outfits for this evening . I 'm fairly certain that I 'll go with the Trigere , but then there 's the matter of all the compliments the brocade received the last time I wore it . When was that ? Maybe I wore it too recently . Did n't I wear it to that party last year ? Wo n't the same people be there ? Maybe it 's sort of cool to wear the same thing again and again . But then , no one 's seen the Trigere . Or have they ? And round and round . To be fashionable requires , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a sense of what looks good , but without some clear vision , you will be in a constant state of confusion . Which is why I 'm going to wear the Trigere tonight . At least I hope so . m <p>
