<p> Jeff Hawn squats on a slab of bleacher behind home plate , his innate baseball radar scanning the field for prospects . His back pocket contains a wish list of the already discovered , names and phone numbers . <p> Hawn faces no geographical constraints . He is chief recruiter for a metro Atlanta-based team that on this day includes 10 players who have routinely flown or driven in for a weekend tournament  --  expenses paid  --  from hometowns in Texas and Alabama and North Carolina and Tennessee . It is mid-June , and the squad he serves is into its 63rd game on a schedule that could surpass 100 by summer 's end . <p> A player shouts from the dugout , " Hey , Daddy , can you get me something to drink ? " <p> They are the Woolsey Yankees , none older than 12 , all objects of scorn or jealousy or admiration , depending on how you view the unrecognizably altered state of youth baseball . They belong to no league or no organization ; their roster of Georgians and out-of-towners is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall and fast and strong , and they enjoy the finer things , courtesy of a hard-driving , hands-on benefactor who once took a 4 1/2-year job sabbatical so he could funnel his considerable energies into kids in cleats . Now , his wife Cindy testifies , Harry Peaden devotes part of the workday with the far-reaching company he owns and operates to figuring out batting orders . <p> " It 's the best competition level there is , " says Hawn , whose son twinkles brightest in Woolsey 's galaxy of little stars . " I want my boy to play with the best . " <p> He is Cody Hawn . A strapping 5 feet 10 , Cody 's moonshot home runs have spawned several nicknames , among them " Tennessee Thumper " and " 44 " ( his jersey number ) . " Cody , " says his father , " he 's just a hired gun . " <p> Hired ? Not exactly , in spite of a reputation that generates questions to players on how much their families get paid . The answer : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Yet , he does not charge moms and dads the standard fees , which can approach $4,000 annually on comparable squads . The Hawns shuttle gratis as often as three times a month between their house in Rockford , Tenn. , near Knoxville , to Yankees games , as do other out-of-state players  --  mostly by air . The elder Hawn says he chose Woolsey over high-powered clubs in Texas , Nevada and California , one of which dangled $400 a week and travel expenses for the entire family . <p> The Yankees , with their five uniform combinations ( including pinstripes , of course ) and three-star accommodations and win-win approach , represent the latest incarnation in a trend that frightens some but also catches baseball up with other youth sports where the dividing line between kick-back fun and training for big-leaguers-in-waiting has blurred . <p> Youth competition gets serious <p> Once upon a time , there was just Little League . Teammates were neighbors . Show up for the game , and you played . <p> " Little League always has been a community program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage elite sports . " <p> Nowadays , Junior can select from a menu of structures and philosophies , many of which have drifted away from Little League precepts . The evolution has produced its own lingo , with the upper-crust teams labeled select or travel . <p> " This is what select baseball is coming to , " Steve Woods , manager of a homegrown team from Chattanooga , says without rancor . The Yankees are " a bunch of good kids ; we enjoy playing them . " <p> Peaden was a pacesetter in the race toward elite baseball . But , he pleads , do n't paste them up as poster boys for excess . " A lot of people do it this way . We just do it with more flamboyance , " he says . " We 're more up-front about it . " <p> For the Yankees , Peaden picks tournaments conducted by up to six youth baseball bodies , according to their rules and restrictions . He favors " the more liberal organizations , " meaning those that , say , permit far-flung rosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By Peaden 's reckoning , the Yankees were 68-4 entering the weekend , which means his typical week starts off well . " Mondays are a lot more fun if you win on the weekend , " says the man who makes George Steinbrenner seem like an absentee owner . " I 'm not a good loser . I 'm a great winner . " <p> He does not just import talent and sit idly by . His 26-acre fenced and gated spread  --  with a 23,000-square-foot home valued at $1.5 million , second in Fayette County to Evander Holyfield 's  --  is a shrine to the sport he loves . Games are staged on a full-scale field with flags , a scoreboard and speakers that blare the national anthem . Balls are smacked at outdoor and indoor batting cages with mounds , a pitching machine and a large-screen TV with a VCR so hitters can study videotape of their swings . Major leaguers such as Marquis Grissom , Al Martin and Royce Clayton have dropped in to provide high-level tutoring . <p> At national tournaments , Brian Herdt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in to prepare scouting reports on Woolsey opponents . Each Yankee 's performance is broken down into 18 statistical categories . Prospects are tracked on the Internet . <p> Peaden has chaperoned squads to 13 national championships in the various youth league structures , winning three . ( He is going through gradual withdrawal , down to two teams this year from a maximum of six . ) He rewards each player on a title squad with a gaudy ring inscribed with a W that Hawn describes as a " $300 rock . " Hawn says visiting parents have access to one of several vehicles on the Peaden property . <p> The entourage bunks in nice hotels , eats well and lets off steam at pricey attractions such as Dave &; Buster 's , all on Peaden 's tab . " He wines ' em and dines ' em , " says Hawn , speaking figuratively , the Yankees being nearly nine years shy of minimum drinking age . <p> Peaden guesses that he will chip in about $50,000 this year on the Yankees , a figure that some appreciative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $200,000 . Peaden claims families share in the cost , but the long-distance travelers say they never tap their savings accounts . " No way we could afford this if he did n't pay , " says Joel Gardner , with son Adam from Tyler , Texas . <p> At any cost , Peaden can . His business , Country-Fed Meats in Riverdale , has 19 retail and 50 wholesale outlets around the country . In 1995 , just before he downsized the company for his leave of absence , it was the nation 's largest seller of frozen meat door-to-door . Although the company sponsors Peaden 's teams , the jerseys say WOOLSEY , a mini-town of 175 residents , one gas station and no stoplights tucked into Fayette 's southeast corner . <p> Peaden is a confessed sports fanatic who played on the 1978 Griffin High football team that tied Valdosta for a state crown . He watches the Braves and Hawks from the front row , has not missed an Atlanta World Series game and once employed Dominique Wilkins and Richard Dent to promote his ribeyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adorned with items autographed by legendary athletes , is a trophy for a state T-ball title , ages 5-6 , from 1992 . It marks Peaden 's plunge into youth baseball . <p> " I got into it to coach my kids , " Peaden says of his three sons , now 15 , 12 , 10 . ( His 16-year-old daughter is a tennis standout . ) " I guess it got a little bigger than we wanted . " <p> By 1996 , Peaden was so smitten that he abandoned his firm to focus on his teams . Recruiting , funding and frequent-flier miles were about to seep into youth baseball ; Peaden 's talents and resources would serve him well . " I 'm a salesman , " he says in his 78 RPM patter , a claim akin to Pavarotti calling himself a singer . At 19 , working at his father 's car lot in Macon , Peaden sold 13 vehicles in one day . <p> Parents praise Peaden 's efforts <p> The Woolsey parents are effusive in their praise of Peaden for creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholarship or , better yet , a pro contract . <p> " Harry is committed to having a good team , to get the best players he can find , " says Bruce Parrish of Birmingham , father of Carlton . " You want your son to be exposed to the best . " <p> " His deal is to teach the boys how to win , " says Gardner . As to whether winning should be stressed to 12-year-olds , the Texan says , " Everybody talks about how it 's not whether you win or lose but how you play the game . Well , you have a lot more fun when you win . " <p> Bruce Grant , citing precise two-hour practices often run by Peaden 's expert pals , says , " The training and discipline ( son Lowell ) has learned over the last three years has been phenomenal . Harry is demanding . I think it gears you for life because life is demanding . If you do n't produce , you do n't reap . " <p> Linda Sholar of Fayetteville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan has improved because of Peaden 's directness and honesty . <p> " Coach Harry , when you make a mistake , he tells you the truth , then he praises you when you do it right the next time , " she says . " You mess up with Harry , you get corrected . Do n't tell them they did a good job when they did n't . " <p> In some corners , Woolsey is viewed as an overly intense program , an image partly shaped by an incident that Peaden would like to forget . <p> Seven years ago , coaching one of his sons in a basketball league , he allegedly was berating the referee , who was 14 . The ref 's father jumped to his defense and was injured in a fight with Peaden . Peaden claimed self-defense but pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery . He lost a national coaching certificate and was expelled from Fayette recreational leagues . So Peaden took his ball home and started his own association . <p> " I wish it had n't happened ; I learned my lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellphone turned off for 90 minutes , during which he will receive 22 calls . <p> " In reality , it was the best thing to happen to me . It made me grow up , and it got me to start all this , " he says , gesturing at his backyard sports paradise , spiced by a pool and tennis and basketball courts . " I used to be so intense . I 'm real laid-back now . " <p> Wearing the full team uniform , as do his assistant coaches , Peaden sits on a bucket near the dugout when the Yankees are afield , shouting encouragement and constructive advice . As the third-base coach on offense , he flashes a barrage of signals to the batter as detailed as any big-leaguer sees . On occasion , the staff gripes at the umpires , which rankles some opposing coaches who maintain that such complaining sets a bad example . <p> Another oft-heard criticism is that players , especially those from metro Atlanta , get bumped aside by more talented ones from out of state . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " People make mountains out of molehills . They do n't bother me . I do n't pay them no attention . " <p> Peaden points out that he avoids daddyball , his term for coaches favoring their sons over other kids . His 12-year-old , Johnny , a standout shortstop , plays regularly , but Taylor , 10 , mostly bides his time on the bench . <p> Also , Peaden allows the commuting players to keep commitments to their hometown teams . The policy sometimes leaves his roster depleted and permits lesser ones to get their pinstripes dirty . <p> Still , the grumbling about Woolsey persists from those upset by the perception of an unlevel playing field tilted by a deep-pocketed man with his carpetbagger roster . <p> " You can tell people do n't like us , " says Cody Hawn . " I just tell them there 's nothing wrong with the team . " <p> Cody , a first baseman , has been fast-tracked by his father since age 2 1/2 . At 4 , the natural right-hander was shifted to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , says his father , that he did n't bother to ride a bike until age 10 . <p> The proud papa rattles off statistics as if he 's Cody 's P.R . spokesman : .622 batting average , one home run in every 3.1 at-bats , once hit a 335-foot homer , straight-A student . <p> Cody says he hardly ever tires of baseball . Jeff occasionally grants his wish to skip a team practice . Even on those days , Cody might head to the batting cage for some solitary swings . <p> Any chance of burnout ? " I ca n't see that happening now , " Cody says . <p> Peaden admits that a 100-game season may be excessive  --  " This is not for everyone "  --  but burnout to him is an epithet . <p> " You know what we call that ? " he says . " Copout . " <p> Critics warn of kids burning out <p> Burnout is real , say critics of a system that gives birth to teams such as the Woolsey Yankees . <p> " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports studies at Ithaca College who teaches a course on youth sports in U.S. culture . " I do n't care how good a kid is . These kids are being treated as machines , commodities . Any physiologist , every M.D. would say this can be pretty risky behavior . Some kids will survive it , some wo n't . <p> " It 's pretty sick . It scares me . " <p> Jim Brown , an editor at Georgia Tech who authored a book on developing young athletes , cites a Little League World Series team on which all but four players had dropped baseball by the time they reached college . <p> " The pendulum has swung too far  --  this is too much ( baseball ) too soon , " he says . " If you 've done all this by age 12 , what else is left to accomplish ? There is no safety net for a kid for when this is over . " <p> Asked for a solution , Brown grows momentarily silent . " The genie is out of the bottle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who assists Peaden , scoffs at the notion that harm befalls youngsters involved in wall-to-wall baseball . Reports of burnout and of damaged arms related to overuse are fiction , he says . <p> " I 've never seen it hurt anybody if the kid wants to be a player . If you want to play , you 're gon na play . " <p> Skeptics question whether the youngster wants to spend his recreational time entirely on bats and balls or is simply doing so to please a parent . " What kid can say no ? " Mosher wonders . <p> Easy , counters Bruce Parrish , who is braced for his son Carlton requesting a break someday . " I 'd let him have one , " Parrish says , " but he has n't ( asked ) . " <p> Bruce Grant sees nothing wrong with son Lowell lavishing in star treatment at a young age . " It 's necessary , " Grant says , to prepare him for a possible life as a pro athlete . " You should always live first-class . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm one of the pioneers of traveling baseball , " he boasts . He urges a visitor to contact a noted youth coach . " He 'll tell you I 'm the best thing in youth baseball in a long time . " <p> If the Yankees are not the country 's supreme 12-year-old team , Peaden says , they are close . As for next year , Jeff Hawn claims nine new commitments for the 13-year-olds . Says Peaden , " He can look at a kid and tell you instantly if he can play . " <p> That 's not all Hawn looks for . He sifts out boys who are even-tempered , who get along with teammates . He consults their parents and digs for information , especially their grades . " If they ai n't disciplined in the classroom , " he says , " they ai n't gon na be on the field . " <p> The Hawns are home in Tennessee , where Cody is collecting another home-run derby trophy for his room , and other prominent Yankees are absent on a Sunday when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two days . Peaden concedes after 2 1/2 innings , then gathers his players , so unaccustomed to losing , for a spirit-lifting speech . <p> They leave the park , laughing , joshing , just being kids . Peaden maintains a stiff upper lip . He knows what 's coming : the Monday morning blues . Passionate about winning : Harry Peaden talks to his team , which uses a major league scout to get reports on opponents and plays about 100 games a season . / BEN GRAY / Staff Photo : Harry Peaden coaches and finances the Woolsey Yankees , a team of top-level 12-year-olds from around the Southeast . / JENNI GIRTMAN / Staff Map : WOOLSEY Map shows location of Fayetteville and Peachtree City ; inset map highlights Fayette County in relation to metro Atlanta / KATIE RIDLEY / Staff Photo : Cody Hawn of Rockford , Tenn. , who once hit a 335-foot homer , was pursued by elite-level teams from Texas , Nevada and California before choosing the Fayette County-based Yankees . / JENNI GIRTMAN / Staff Photo : The Yankees private baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pitching machine and a large-screen TV with a VCR so hitters can study videotape of their swings . / JENNI GIRTMAN / Staff Photo : Johnny Peaden , 12 , plays shortstop for the Yankees . / JENNI GIRTMAN / Staff
