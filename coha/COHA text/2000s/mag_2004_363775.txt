Sleep is critical to the healing process , yet sound sleep in a hospital is notoriously difficult to come by . To get to the source of the problem , a team of nurses conducted a study at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn . The nurses placed noise dosimeters in patient rooms , and two volunteered to sleep over and note bothersome sounds in a thoracic-surgery unit packed with humming equipment and monitors . Peak dosimeter readings as high as 113 decibels  --  roughly equivalent to the din of a chain saw or jackhammer  --  came during the 7 a.m. staff changeover , and the 11 p.m. changeover was also quite noisy . By adopting remedial measures  --  some as simple as closing doors to patients ' rooms and replacing clanking paper-towel dispensers  --  the staff reduced noise levels more than 80% , according to the report published in the American Journal of Nursing . For convalescing patients , that 's better than a lullaby .  --  D.B.                   @ @
