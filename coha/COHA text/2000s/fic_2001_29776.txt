Forget chewing nails Ryan Kendrick was so mad he could have chewed lug nuts . He had a broken down tractor , and the parts needed to fix it should have been delivered to the Rocking K day before yesterday . As of this morning , they still had n't arrived , and Ryan 's follow-up calls had gotten him nowhere . With one shoulder , he butted open the door of The Works , the largest ranch supply house in Crystal Falls . Harv Coulter , a rancher who 'd gone bust , had started the business on a shoestring several years back , and the Kendrick brothers , along with many other ranchers in the area , had been patronizing the establishment ever since . Now the huge store was a going concern , well stocked with everything from heavy equipment to fancy western wear , the only problem being that as sales increased , the quality of service seemed to go downhill . If Harv did n't get his employees whipped into shape , he 'd start losing accounts . Delays like this , smack-dab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to late snows , every farmer and rancher in the basin was already behind schedule , and each day of downtime could mean thousands of dollars in lost crop revenue . Ryan headed for an overhead sign at the rear of the feed section that read , " PARTS AND REPAIRS , " his dusty riding boots beating out an angry tattoo on the concrete floor . When he reached a counter cluttered with parts and catalogs , he shoved aside an air filter , rested his arms on the grease-stained Formica , and settled a blistering gaze on a slender young woman who sat at a computer station near theregister . A long , luxurious mane of sable hair partly concealed her face . Her slender , neatly manicured fingers flew over the keyboard with speedy efficiency . Ryan waited for just a moment . Being ignored did little to mellow his mood . The morning was half over . He glanced at his watch and set his jaw . " Excuse me , " he said . " Is it possible to get some help around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , his gaze riveted . She had the most beautiful eyes , large , outlined with thick , dark lashes , and so deep a blue they reminded him of the Johany-jump-up violets that grew wild at the ranch . Normally , he scoffed at the sappy phrases men used to describe women . He 'd looked into a lot of eyes and never felt in danger of drowning , or losing his heart . " I do n't usually work the floor , but I can try to help you . " she said , her voice as sunny as her smile , which flashed an irresistible dimple in one cheek . Ryan could n't stop staring . Her face was small and heart-shaped , with sculpted cheekbones , a pointy chin with just a hint of stubbornness , and a soft , sweet mouth . The tip of her delicately bridged nose was shiny and sported a smattering of freckles , which told him her flawless complexion was natural . " What seems to be the problem ? " she asked . He started to tell her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a wrangler 's pocket right before payday , and he could n't remember why the hell he was there . He had the strangest feeling , dead center in his chesta sense of recognitionas if he 'd subconsciously been searching for her all his life . Crazy . Love at first sight was more his brother 's style Ryan shopped for women like he did for boots , trying them on for size before he settled in for a long-term relationship , and even at that , he 'd yet to find a comfortable enough fit to last him a lifetime . " I , um ... " He rubbed beside his nose , a habit when he got nervous . A dull ache throbbed behind his eyes . " I 'm Ryan Kendrick from the Rocking K , " he offered stupidly . The sweet curve of her lips deepened . " Hi . I 'm pleased to meet you . And do n't feel bad . I have days like this , only worse . At least you know your name . " He huffed with laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed again . " What works for me is to back up . You 're Ryan Kendrick from the Rocking K , and you came in here to ... ? " He snapped his fingers . " My parts . " " Your parts ? " He chuckled . " I want to know where the Sam Hill they are . " Pure devilment crept into her expression . " You 've lost your parts and think I 've got them ? Most cowboys I know guard theirs like Fort Knox . " Ryan threw back his head and laughed . The tension that had knotted the muscles in his neck and shoulders all morning miraculously vanished . " I hope you do n't have a hot date lined up for Saturday night , " she added . " A cowboy who 's missing his parts could find himself in a very embarrassing situation . " He nudged up the brim of his Stetson . " Well , now , darlin ' , that all depends . What are you doin ' Saturday night ? " It was her turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it warmed him clear through . " I usually avoid cowboys who ca n't keep track of their parts . " " Go out with me , and I guarantee I 'll find mine in damned short order . " " Maybe if you 'll give me an order number instead of a hard time , I can help locate the little buggers for you . " Little buggers ? Ryan almost corrected that misconception . But there were lines a man did n't step over , and he had a hunch this was one of them . Maybe it was the sweetness of her smileor that innocent look he 'd glimpsed in her eyesbut something told him she was n't as worldly as she pretended to be . As he fished in the pocket of his blue chambray shirt , he swept his gaze over her . She was a fragile , slightly built woman , which undoubtedly explained why those eyes seemed to be the biggest thing about her . But despite that , she was temptingly well-rounded in all the right places . Perfection in miniature . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin but well-defined shoulders , and creamy-white arms that looked surprisingly firm for someone with such a slight build . Beneath the brown knit , small , perfectly shaped breasts pleaded for a lingering look . Minding his manners , he flicked his gaze lower and bemoaned the fact that the counter concealed the rest of her . He was a leg man , and it was a woman 's foundation that always swung the vote for him . Wishing she 'd stand up so he could get a look , he handed over the slip of paper on which he 'd jotted his order number . While she scanned computer files and tracked down his parts order , they carried on a lively exchange , during which he learned she was twenty-six , had no significant other in her life except a feline named Cleo , and was the baby in a family of six kids . Her five rambunctious older brothers spoiled her rotten and kept things hopping at family gatherings . Ryan enjoyed talking with her . Even with her attention divided between him and the computer screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't often he ran across beauty , brains , and a great personality , all in one package . " Soyou gon na give me a name to put with the face ? " he asked . " Bethany . " Finished with the computer , she leaned back in her chair . " Well , cowboy , time to eat crow . Guess where those parts of yours are . " " Where ? " " En route to the Rocking K. And it 's not our fault they 're late . This is the busy season . Those particular parts are in high demand right now , were on back order , and took two days longer to reach us than they should have . " Ryan had heard that one before , but coming from her , it seemed more credible . He tipped the brim of his bat back down to shade his eyes before returning outdoors . " Hmm . Lucky for me , I did n't raise too much sand , huh ? " " It takes more than a cantankerous cowboy to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her elbows on the chair armrests , her big blue eyes still smiling . " Have a nice day , and good luck fixing your tractor . Too bad you 're not an employee . You could charge yourself time and a half . " By that , Ryan guessed she knew who he was . No big surprise . Practically everyone in Crystal Falls , Oregon , had heard of the Kendrick family . He tipped his hat to her . " Thank you , Bethany . It 's been a rare pleasure . " " Any time , " she called after him as he walked away . He had nearly reached the door before he swung to a stop . To hell with walking out . He was thirty years old and had n't come across a woman who interested him this much in a long time . Bethany . She was beautiful , sweet , and funny . The only other women he knew who could take him from pissed off to laughing in three seconds flat were his mom and sister-in-law . No way was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date if he Could manage it . " I know this may seem forward , " he began as he returned to the counter . Already back at work , she glanced up from the screen , her thoughtful frown giving way to another warm smile . " You 've lost your parts again already ? " Ryan chuckled . " Not on your life . I just " He felt heat crawling up his neck . He had n't felt nervous about asking a girl out since his early teens . " About Saturday night . I know we were only joking , but on a more serious note , I 'd like to get to know you . " At her startled look , he added , " Hey , I 'm a nice guy . Your boss , Harvey Coulter , will vouch for me . " " Oh , I 'm sure you 're very nice , but " Ryan held up a staying hand . " How about dinner and dancing ? We 'll go out , have a fine meal , get to know each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug . I 'm hell on wheels at country western , and I know of a great band . " Her mouth curved in a wistful smile . " You like to dance , do you ? " " I love to dance . How about you ? " She averted her gaze . Ryan wanted to kick himself for coming on too fast . So much for that legendary charm his brother teased him about . Well , it was too late now . All he could do was go for it and hope for the best . " I used to enjoy dancing very much . " She tapped a pen on the work surface beside her computer , her small hand clenched so tightly over its length that her dainty knuckles went white . Ryan shoved up the brim of his hat . He did his best convincing with his eyes . " Come on , sweetheart , take a chance on me . We 'll have fun . I give you my solemn oath to be a perfect gentleman . " " It is n't that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw that all the laughter and mischief in her eyes had been eclipsed by shadows . He sensed he 'd said or done something to cause that , but for the life of him he could n't think what . " If you 're worried that you 're too rusty to get on a dance floor , I 'm easy to follow . Give me ten minutes , and you 'll think you 've got wings on your feet . " She rolled her chair back from the computer station and folded her hands in her lap , gazing up at him with a prideful lift of her small chin . " Somehow I rather doubt that . " Her strained , overbright smile was foiled by the flush of embarrassment on her cheeks . " Do n't you ? " It took Ryan a full second to register what she meant . Then he saw that she was sitting in a wheelchair . He felt as if a horse had kicked him in the gutan awful . suddenly breathless feeling that made his legs threaten to buckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and perfect in every other way , the girl of his dreams . There was no wayabsolutely no way . But then his gaze dropped to her legs . The hem of her gathered black skirt came to just below the knees , revealing flesh toned support hose , finely turned ankles , and small feet encased in black slippers . The way her feet were positioned on the rests , one turned inward , was typical of a paraplegic 's , and as shapely as her calves were , he could see that her muscles had begun to atrophy . Sweet Christ . He felt like a worm . His first knee-jerk reaction was to make a polite excuse and get the hell out of them . To run . The thought made him feel ashamed . Judging by those shadows in her eyes , she 'd been down this path before and gotten badly hurt , undoubtedly by a long line of jackasses just like him who 'd run when they saw her wheelchair . He 'd be damned if he 'd do that to her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make fast tracks or start stammering . That was usually the way it went . Watching his dark face , she had to give him credit ; he looked stunned for a moment , but he quickly recovered . Flashing a wickedly attractive grin , he said , " Well , hell , I guess dancing 's out . Unless , of course , I can come up with a set of wheels so we can do the wheelchair tango . " Usually men avoided mentioning her wheelchair , and while they groped for something to say , their eyes reflected a frantic need to escape . She always wanted to crawl in a hole when that happened , but Ryan Kendrick 's reaction was even worse . If he felt an urge to run , he was a great loss to the stage . " There are a number of things besides dancing that we can go do . " He rested loosely folded fists at his lean waist , frowned , and then started naming off ideas , ending with , " How 's dinner followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming . Terrifying . He was supposed to be heading for the closest exit . She flirted all the time . A girl had to have some fun , after all . But no man had ever taken her up on it . She did n't know what to say . Every time she looked into his gun-metal blue eyes , her mind went blank . He was so handsome , the epitome of tall , dark , and gorgeous . Chiseled features , a strong jaw , jet hair , and oodles of muscle . A dangerous mix . Crystal Falls was a large town , and Bethany had attended different schools than Ryan had . She 'd also been a few years younger , so they 'd never moved in the same social circles . But as a teenager , she 'd seen him a few times at a distance , usually out at the fairgrounds during rodeos , and she 'd thought he was handsome even then . He was even more attractive now . Little wonder his name was almost legend and half the women in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um ... " She shrugged , for once in her life at a total loss for words . If one of her brothers had been present , he would have marked the moment . Her gaze fell to his mouth . His lips were long and narrow , mere slashes in the granite hardness of his face , yet beautifully sculpted with the muted shimmer of satin . At present , one corner of that hard mouth was twitching , as if he were suppressing a smile . " Dinner and a movie is n't very imaginative , I know , " he stud apologetically . " I 'll think of something more exciting next time around . " Next time ? She was n't sure how to deal with this . Why was he wasting his time with her ? Because he felt sorry for her , maybe ? She did n't want his pity . She should have made certain he saw the wheelchair right away . Then this never would have happened . She could n't go out with him . Her legs might not work , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendrick Was a little too charming . With those twinkling eyes and that sexy grin chipping away at her defenses , it would be all too easy to get in over her head . She smoothed her hands over her skirt to make sure it covered her knees . There had to be a graceful way out of this . " Actually , Mr. Kendrick , the reason I hesitate is because I think I may be busy Saturday night . " He never missed a beat . " How about Friday , then ? " He no sooner spoke than he snapped his fingers . " No , Friday wo n't work . I 'm sponsoring a tractor in the mud pulls that night , and I really should be at the fairgrounds . " " Mud pulls ? " Bethany immediately wanted to bite her tongue . His gaze sharpened on her face . " Are you a mud-pull enthusiast ? " She pushed at her hair , then rolled closer to the counter to straighten the work area . " I used to enjoy them very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud pulls . " She shrugged . " I had strange tastes for a girl , I guess . " " Why past tense ? If you really enjoy the mud pulls , I 'd love to take you . " He 'd obviously never been around a paraplegic . " Oh , I could n't possibly . " " Why not ? " " Between the parking lot and track , there 's an acre of dirt and gravel . " " What 's a little dirt and gravel ? " Her pulse started to pound . She swallowed , drew a deep breath , and tried to calm down . He was n't interested in her that way ; he was only being kind . She needed to focus on that , keep her sense of humor , and laugh this off . A little stark reality was called for , apparently . Who better to give him a dose ? " To a walking person , a little dirt and gravel is no big thing , " she said slowly . " But my wheelchair tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep gravel is difficult . " He gave her a measuring look . " Does it hurt you to be carried ? " " Pardon ? " " Does it cause you any pain when someone carries you ? " " You 're kidding . Right ? You ca n't mean to carry me . " " Why not ? " Why not ? He really did n't have a clue . " The question is n't if it might hurt me , but whether or not your back can take the abuse . " She shook her head . " It 's very nice of you to offer . Really it is , Mr. Kendrick , but " " Ryan , " he corrected . " Or Rye , if you prefer . I answer to both . And I 'm not being nice . ' I really want to take you . " " Ryan , then . " Searching his gaze , which made her feel as if she 'd just swallowed live goldfish , she said , " You 're sweet to offer , but you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no walkways or bleachers down at that track . " " So ? You have a chair , and I 'll take a camp stool along for myself . " " No , you do n't understand . It 's not the seating arrangements that worry me but that you d have to carry my chair down there . It 's very heavy and awkward to handle , and then you 'd have to haul me down there as well . " She shook her head again . " No . About the time you got me settled , it 'd be my luck I 'd need to use the ladies ' room , which ns clear up at the stadium . That 's at least a quarter mile . There you 'd be , carrying me and my chair all the way up there , then all the way back . By evening s end , you 'd be wishing you never asked me . " " You ca n't weigh more than a hundred pounds . My back can handle it . " " A hundred and eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half of that was dead-weight , which was heavier and more awkward to handle . " All of that ? " He chuckled , his steel-blue eyes dancing with amusement . " Honey , I lift twice your weight dozens of times a day . " " No , I " " It 's a date , " he insisted . Stepping to the counter , he reached over to push a notepad toward her . " I 'll be on your doorstep to pick you up at precisely six o'clock on Friday night . Just jot down your address and phone number . " " I really " " Come on , " he cajoled . " We 'll have fun . It is n't often I meet a lady who enjoys the mud pulls . Where have you been all my life ? " She laughed and tried one more time to discourage him . " I 'm really not much on dating . You do n't have to do this . Honestly . You 're off the hook . " In response to that , he narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name address , and phone number . If you wo n't give them to me , I 'll play dirty and get them from Harv Coulter . The Rocking K is his largest account . " Imagining her father 's reaction , Bethany smiled . " I should let you go ask him . It might prove interesting . I do n't suppose you 're a betting man ? " " Sometimes . What s the wager ? " " That my boss not only wo n't give you my address but may run you out of here with a shotgun . Daddy tends to be overprotective of his baby girl . " " You 're Harv 's daughter ? " " His one and only . " With a sigh of resignation , she bent her head and wrote the information he 'd requested on the slip of paper . " Do n't say I did n't warn you . By evening 's end , when you 're popping ibuprofen and wishing you had a back brace , I do n't want to hear any complaints . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the notepad and handed it to him , she added , " If something comes up and you need to cancel , Ryan , you can reach me here at the store during the day . I really would appreciate a call . For someone like me , getting ready to go somewhere is no easy thing . " He folded the paper and slipped it in his pocket . " I 'll show . Count on it . " She shrugged , hoping to convey that she did n't care one way or the other . " I 'll accept any excuse . Even my dog ate my homework ' will work . " She forced a bright smile . " Friday , " he said huskily . " Six o'clock sharp . I 'll be looking forward to it . " As he walked away , Bethany heard footsteps behind her . She glanced over her shoulder to see her brother Jake approaching . Dressed in the same ranch-issue faded denim and blue chambray as Ryan , he looked enough like the other man to be related . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tough look of a man who 'd pitted himself against the elements most of his life . Jake also had beautiful eyesa deep , clear blue that was almost startling in contrast to his sun-dark skin and sable hair . At the moment , those eyes were fixed with glaring intensity on Ryan Kendrick 's departing back . " What was that all about ? " " What was what all about ? " she asked innocently . Jake gave her a long , questioning look . " As I was coming downstairs , I saw the two of you talking , and it looked like he was flirting with you . " Bethany raised her eyebrows . " Flirting with me ? How long 's it been since you had your eyes checked ? " His jaw muscle started to tic . " You 're paralyzed , Bethie , not dead . And you 're a very pretty lady . I know men must flirt with you occasionally . " " So why the scowl ? " " Because that particular man is bad news . You steer clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reputation . " Still single at thirty-one , Jake had a bit of a reputation himself . Bethany refrained from pointing that out . " A reputation for what ? " " Loving them and leaving them . " Jake stepped over to the counter , opened a parts catalog , and pulled a pen from his shirt pocket . " Do n't do any toe-dipping in that particular pond . It 's inhabited by a shark , and I do n't want my little sister to be his next victim . "
