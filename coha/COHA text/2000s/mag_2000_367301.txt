The Battle over Elian <P> " If Castro had held a U.S. citizen this long , the Marine Corps flag would be flying over the rubble that once was Havana . " DON BARKER Nashville , Tenn . <P> Those who said they were ashamed to be Americans after the Immigration and Naturalization Service agents forcibly removed Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives should be ashamed of themselves NATION , May 1 . Were they proud when the family showered Elian with every imaginable bribe ? Were they proud when the family demonized Elian 's father , in a desperate attempt to keep the child in Miami ? Were they proud of that heart-wrenching video of Elian demanding to stay in the U.S. ? Until now , only Fidel Castro himself could have orchestrated such manipulation and brainwashing . BARRY BERGER Mission , Texas <P> The picture of Elian being forcibly taken by the INS agents ranks with other unforgettable , searing images , from the Vietnam War and Kent State . MICHAEL B. VAN WINKLE Ridgefield , Conn . <P> My wife and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waiting for the movie . RALPH SCHWEITZER Prince George , B.C. <P> Is everyone as sick of the Elian saga as I am ? If it did not involve the Cuban-American community , the story would have been over long ago . As a lifelong Republican , I am ashamed of my party for not supporting Reno . Cubans in America should be glad that we have laws and that they have the same rights and responsibilities as other Americans . Elian was used by the Cuban community in Miami , by politicians , by lawyers and by Castro . The whole affair was a pathetic display of human selfishness . KEN CAMMENGA Hudsonville , Mich . <P> If Elian had been returned to his father immediately , he would be further along in the healing process than he is now after the agonizing five-month wait and the situations his Miami relatives have exposed him to . NELIA PYNN Rochester , N.Y . <P> The deed has been done , but at what cost ? I have heard immigrants say the best thing about America is that one can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night . Something sacred was forever lost in the early-morning raid on April 22 . MARY M. SCHMITT Ellensburg , Wash . <P> The Gonzalez case is complicated , but I can find only one person to root for : Elian . All others involved should be ashamed of themselves  --  Castro for creating a country that a woman would risk her life to leave ; Elian 's relatives for parading the poor child around in a media circus ; Attorney General Janet Reno for ordering armed commandos to drag the frightened child out into the early-morning darkness . With all the resources available to our government , I can not believe there were no other solutions . HOLLY ROBINSON Norwalk , Conn . <P> Reno is to be commended for her patience in the Gonzalez debacle . I 'm only sorry that she did n't take an offensive position sooner with the Miami relatives . She could justifiably have charged them with kidnapping and inciting a riot . Employing this strategy might have silenced their theatrics . KAREN LEVIN Severna Park , Md . <P> Elian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force was even worse . Let 's hope it did n't do permanent damage . PATRICIA LIMON Guadalajara , Mexico
