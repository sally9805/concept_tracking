I was that happy once . <p> Olivia Hastings slipped away from the crowd at the hilltop wedding reception to regain her peace of mind . She set her bridesmaid bouquet on a rock before wandering farther downhill and away from the laughing guests . <p> A few moments of solitude were all Olivia needed . <p> " We 're not s'posed to come here . " <p> That childish warning , barely audible , floated toward her on the soft summer wind , rousing her curiosity . The Woodward twins ? <p> Olivia kept walking , stepping carefully around thistles as she followed the voices . The twins , Brett and Brady Woodward , were the bride 's nephews . They 'd taken part in a fundraiser Olivia had directed last month . The twins had stolen the show , though their father had n't bothered to see it . <p> Reese Woodward was busy , his sister Sara claimed . Olivia thought he was too busy . <p> " Uncle Cade said he caught fish in here when he was a little boy . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over hillocks topped with cropped grass , not caring that her silk dress would probably be ruined . <p> Two four-year-old boys near water spelled disaster . <p> " I want to catch a fish . " <p> " No , Brett . Uncle Cade said " <p> His voice dissipated . Olivia strained , but could n't see the boys . She glanced around to call for help and realized no one would hear above the wedding reception music . Anyway , the wind would carry her voice away . She 'd have to manage on her own . Olivia felt certain that , given the love she 'd witnessed the Woodward family lavish on the twins , one or another of Denver 's famous wedding-planning family would soon come looking . <p> " Brett , you ca n't go in . Daddy said  --  " <p> " You boys get away from that water , " Olivia yelled in her sternest tone , praying she would n't be too late . She stubbed her toe on a rock and bit down to smother her cry as she climbed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There . She could see them . Brady hovered at the edge of the water , obviously uncertain about his next move . But Brett already had one shoe off . <p> " Hey ! " Olivia shouted , waving her hands . Brady saw her , smiled and waved back . Brett was wading in . " No ! " <p> But in the next moment Brett tumbled face-first into the swiftly moving water . When it looked like Brady would go in after him , Olivia threw caution aside and raced downhill , ignoring the stabs and jabs of anything that tried to impede her progress . <p> Brady teetered on one leg , about to lose his balance . Olivia plucked him up and sat him on a big rock several feet from the water 's edge . <p> " Do n't you dare move , " she ordered . " I ca n't see Brett . " <p> Big , fat tears tumbled down chubby cheeks . Brady pointed . <p> " There . " He sniffed . " He 's not swimming . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'll get him , Brady , but do n't you move . Promise me . " <p> " ' Kay . " <p> " Good boy . " Olivia stepped into the stream . Moving as swiftly as possible , she kept going , though the water was icy cold against her warm skin . In seconds her thin dress was soaked and she was chilled . <p> Olivia ignored it as she 'd learned to ignore the pain of loss that so often gripped her heart . When she was deep enough , she began swimming . It seemed to take forever , but finally she was able to grab a corner of Brett 's white tuxedo and tug him into her arms . <p> Moving as fast as she dared over the sharp yet slippery rocks , Olivia carried the still body to shore . She laid Brett flat and began lifesaving maneuvers she 'd learned years ago in a Red Cross class . While she worked , she prayed , vaguely aware that Brady was bawling at the top of his lungs . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Olivia kept working . Finally the boy responded , spewing a mouthful of water all over her before he gasped for oxygen . <p> " Thank you , Father , " she whispered , holding him as the last of the water gurgled out and his breathing grew more normal . <p> " No , thank you . " Reese grabbed his son 's shoulders and helped him sit up . When Brett tried to stand , Reese wrapped him in his arms and held on , eyes squeezed shut . His chest heaved with the exertion of running downhill . Beads of sweat dotted his forehead . His gray-white face looked like an ice sculpture as he hugged the shivering little body against him . <p> Olivia stayed silent for a few minutes , but finally she touched the shoulder of the man who 'd played best man to her bridesmaid in his sister 's wedding . His eyes flew open and he stared at her as if awakening from a nightmare . <p> " Come on , we need to get away from here . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frosted with fear . <p> Olivia understood that horrible choking awareness that a child you 'd protected and adored since birth , a child you would sacrifice your very life for , had almost been snatched away . <p> Only in her case , there was no almost . <p> " I 'm cold , Daddy , " Brett stuttered , his teeth chattering . <p> " The water comes from snow on the mountains . " The leashed tension in Reese 's voice chastened the young miscreant into silence as he carried the boy to safety . <p> Olivia followed them , picking her way back along the water 's edge . Her feet screamed a protest , but she ignored it , smiling when Brady blubbered with joy at the sight of his bedraggled twin . <p> " He 's fine , Brady . " She led them to a massive boulder that felt deliciously warm to the touch . " Reese ? " <p> " Yeah ? " He looked at her , his blue eyes dark as storm clouds . <p> " He can sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't move . His arms remained locked around his child . " Brett 's cold , Reese . We have to warm him up . " <p> The frantic father studied her for a moment before he looked down at the boy he held . He seemed unable to let go . <p> " Brett is all right , Reese . But he 's cold and wet and we need to fix that . " She did n't want to frighten Brett , but his shivering bothered her . She stood on tiptoe and whispered in Reese 's ear . " You 're scaring him . Put him down , okay ? " <p> He looked at her as if she 'd asked him to move mountains . <p> " Put him down , Reese . I only want to help . " <p> He finally nodded , loosening his grip by degrees until at last Brett had been lowered to the big rock she 'd indicated . But Reese remained close by , obviously not quite trusting her with his precious child . <p> Olivia 's heart ached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wedding partner . So she smiled , then began removing Brett 's shirt and pants . <p> " Come on , sweetheart . Slip out of these wet things . We 'll let that big old sun warm you up . " When she fumbled , Reese helped , but his stiff , jerky actions gave away his distress . <p> After a moment , Reese moved toward Brady . His hand shook as he reached for the boy 's fingers and a strangled breath squeezed out from his throat at the contact . <p> " Brady 's fine , Reese . Everything is all right now , " Olivia soothed softly , hoping to reassure all of them . As she brushed damp brown curls off Brett 's forehead , she could n't resist pressing a kiss against his sweet cheek . " Feeling better , sweetheart ? " <p> " K-kind of . " He stared up at her , his spiky lashes stuck together . " Are you going to take off your dress ? It 's wet , t-too ? " <p> " I 'm fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip off your jacket , will you ? Brett needs it to warm up . " <p> Once Olivia had Brett buttoned inside the white jacket , she gave way to her own weakness and sank down beside him , smothering a groan at the sweet heat of the stone against her skin . Still Reese hovered , silent and grim , holding Brady close . <p> " It 's okay , " she repeated softly . " It 's okay . " <p> Several minutes passed before Reese nodded . He drew an audible breath , then sat Brady next to Brett . He cupped his palm around each miniature chin , forcing his sons to look at him . <p> " What were you doing , Brett ? Uncle Cade told you not to come down here . " <p> " Y-yes . But I wanted to catch a fish . I almost d-did , too , " he chattered , his chin thrusting out with pride . <p> Olivia 's heart lurched at the thought of what might have been . Anika had been four when  --  <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue flowers . " Brady pointed uphill to blooms that were at least three hundred feet above them . " You said that was the rule , did n't you , Daddy ? " <p> Olivia struggled to control her shivering . If only she had enough strength to drag herself back up the hill . But the truth was , she felt drained . Death had come too close . <p> But it had not taken another child this time . <p> " Why did you disobey me and your uncle ? " Reese demanded in a rasping voice . <p> " I do n't like rules , " Brett said as if that explained everything . <p> " Too bad . Everybody has to follow rules , Brett . " There was no give in Reese 's tone . " That 's the way life is . Rules help protect us from bad things . " <p> " They did n't pro-teck my mom . " Brady mourned . " I heard Great Granny say my mom followed the rules when she stopped at the sign . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glared at his father . " Dead means she 's gone , and she is n't coming back ever again . " <p> Reese 's mouth worked , but he said nothing . So Olivia took over . <p> " Do you remember your mother , Brady ? " <p> From her many conversations with Sara , Olivia knew Reese 's wife had died several years earlier . The twins would probably not remember her , but Olivia knew it would be helpful to encourage them to talk about her anyway . Maybe something today had triggered a sense of loss . <p> " Brady does n't remember nothing . " <p> " Do so . She had brown hair . " Brady glared at his brother . " Like choc-lat . " <p> " You saw that in a picture . You do n't remember it . " Brett 's voice wobbled . " I think I do sometimes , but  --  " He shrugged , his little face confused . <p> Olivia glanced at Reese , expecting him to soothe them . But he was still dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . <p> " Sweetheart , your mom is tucked inside here . " Olivia tapped Brett 's little chest . " She would n't care if you remembered what she looked like . All she 'd care about is that you remember that she loved you very much . " <p> Brett studied her for a few minutes . <p> " There 's only Daddy and us in our house . It 's not like the kids at day care . Most of them have daddies and mommies . I wish I had a mommy . " <p> " Why do you wish that , Brett ? " Years of training and thousands of phone calls to a kids ' radio show Olivia had taken from a small New York station to national syndication had taught her that talking was often the best therapy . <p> " The other kids ' mommies send cookies on special days and push them on the swings and help say prayers at night . " Brady , not Brett , volunteered the information . <p> " But your dad does things with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let me be wrong . <p> " Not cookies , " Brady corrected . " He does other things . " <p> " The minister at church said God made families with moms and dads . " Brett blinked at her through the hank of dark brown hair that flopped over one eye . " We do n't gots a mom . " <p> Implying God did n't make his family ? <p> Realizing Reese was n't capable of responding at that moment , Olivia hurried to reassure . <p> " God loves all kinds of families , Brett . He loves families with lots of kids and families with only one little boy or girl . He loves families with only a daddy or only a mommy , too . That part does n't matter to God . What matters is that families love each other . I know you love your daddy . " <p> " Yep , " Brett squealed , jumped up . " I love you , Daddy . " <p> " I love you , too . " Reese 's voice emerged hoarse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged him close . He smiled at Olivia , but it was a distracted courtesy . His attention returned to Brett . <p> " Why did you come here ? " The question held a warning . <p> Brett 's bottom lip jutted out . " To fish . " <p> " What did Cade say ? " Reese squatted with Brady resting on his knee . " What did I say , Brett ? " His voice was stern , his gaze intense , but his hand , as he lifted it to drag through his hair , trembled . When the boy did n't speak , Reese repeated , " What did I say ? " <p> " Not to . " <p> " What did you promise ? Both of you ? " <p> " Not to come . " Brady looked at his brother . " I told him not to . " <p> " But you came along with him . After you 'd both promised me . " <p> Olivia admired the way Reese forced them to admit their wrongdoing without raising his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes still looked haunted by the near disaster , he was trying to teach them . <p> " I make rules to protect you guys , so you wo n't get hurt . I do that because I love you and because I do n't want anything bad to happen to you . " Reese inhaled to steady his voice . " Brett could have drowned . This water is dangerous . It 's not a place for kids to come by themselves . Cade told you and I told you , but you disobeyed anyway . " <p> " If I had swimming lessons I could  --  " <p> " Brett ! " <p> The little boy gulped , raised his head and looked at his dad , shame washing over his face . <p> " I 'm sorry , Daddy . " <p> " Me , too , " Brady chirped right before he wrapped his chubby arms around Reese 's neck and squeezed . <p> Olivia 's heart tightened . If only she could feel Anika 's beloved arms once more . If only Trevor Her heart wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , too . " Reese sat the boys back down , his tone firmer now . " But being sorry is n't always enough . It would n't do any good to be sorry if Brady did n't have a brother anymore , would it , Brett ? " <p> The twins stared at each other as if they 'd never imagined such a thing . <p> " Obedience is important . The only way I can do my daddy job properly is to keep you two safe . That 's why you have to obey me . " <p> Fatherhood equaled safety ? Olivia frowned . <p> Reese looked in control , but she saw signs that his emotions were still riding high . And little wonder . <p> " Do you understand ? " <p> Two brown heads slowly nodded . <p> " Are we getting punished ? " <p> " Yes , Brett , you are . After Auntie Sara 's party , when we 're at home . Right now I want you to put on your shoes , take your brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the house . You can change clothes . Emily will help you . " He pointed to the teenage girl who stood at the crest of the hill , watching . " Understand ? " <p> " Yes , Daddy . " <p> They began gathering their belongings . <p> " Boys ? " <p> They turned , studied Reese with question marks in their eyes . <p> " Do you have something to say to Olivia ? " <p> " Thank you for helping my brother , " Brady said . He gave her a shy hug . <p> " Yeah . Thanks . " Brett offered his hand . Once she 'd shaken it , he backed away . " I 'm sorry you got wet and your dress got wrecked . " <p> " I 'm glad you 're okay , Brett . " <p> " No more disobeying , " Reese ordered . " You either behave yourselves or we 'll go home right now . " <p> " And miss seeing the horsies ? " Brady 's eyes swelled . <p> " And miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Brett . " Brady shoved his brother 's shoes at him , then nudged him upward . " We got ta be good . " <p> Olivia smiled as she watched the adorable pair scurry uphill . Then her attention returned to Reese . <p> " Are you all right ? " <p> " I 'm not sure I 'll ever be all right again , " he muttered half under his breath . Then he shook his head at her , smiled . " I 'm fine . I lost about five years when I saw you dragging him out . He could have drowned . " <p> " But he did n't . They 're all right , thank the Lord . " <p> " The Lord . Yeah . " Reese did n't sound as if he was giving God any of the credit for the twins ' safety as he tracked their progress uphill . <p> " They really are all right , " Olivia whispered . <p> " Yeah . I know . " But he did n't look away until the young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia tried to hide the shiver that rippled over her , but Reese 's moody gaze had registered her discomfort . <p> " I 'm sorry . I should have done this earlier . " He slid out of his tuxedo jacket and draped it over her shoulders . " Better ? " <p> " Thanks . " She sighed as his warmth caressed her goose-pimpled skin . <p> " It 's I who should thank you . When I saw Brett floating on that water , I thought my heart would stop . I could n't have wished for a better rescuer . " His hands fisted at his sides , but when Reese noticed her glance he shoved them in his pockets . " You know your first aid . " <p> " I took a course  --  the basics , nothing extra . It came in handy . " <p> " Yeah . " A half smile lifted his lips . " Thank you . " <p> " You 're welcome . " She strove for levity to break the tension . " You did n't step on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Ha ! Very funny . " His broad white-covered shoulders lifted with his sigh . " What a day . " <p> " A wedding here , a swim there . " Olivia shrugged . " Pretty ordinary . " <p> " I 'd like to know what kind of life you lead . " <p> " A boring one , " she said quickly before he could ask more . <p> " You have a great rapport with my sons . Of course , Sara told me that when the boys were in that theater project of yours . I must have blocked it . " <p> " Ah . " Blocked it or did n't notice ? <p> " Life with those two  --  " he raked a hand through his hair before jerking a thumb over one shoulder "  --  does n't allow a lot of time for thinking . I 'm always in protect or prevent mode . They 're so little and I could n't bear it if  --  " <p> " I understand . " Too well . Losing a child was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never thought she 'd live through . <p> Olivia 's admiration for Reese grew . Sara 's comments about her overprotective brother had painted a very different picture of the man who now looked shaken and disturbed by the incident that had just occurred . <p> Reese Woodward was actually quite charming . <p> " We should go . " He glanced at her feet . " Your feet must feel horrible . And you seem to have lost your shoes . " <br> Continues ...
