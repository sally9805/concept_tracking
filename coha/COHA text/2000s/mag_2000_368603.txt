Yugoslavia 's new President , Vojislav Kostunica , met with TIME 's Andrew Purvis and Dejan Anastasijevic in Belgrade . <P> Q. Are you concerned that the old regime will attempt a counter-coup ? <P> A. There are no chances for that . That notion is based on the idea that the Milosevic regime ca n't be beaten . But he has lost . And now his party is in disarray . <P> Q. Should Milosevic be tried for war crimes ? <P> A. At this moment , I am not thinking about that . We are burdened by all sorts of difficulties concerning the social and economic situation . An instant trial in the Hague would endanger the very fragile democratic process here . Also , the way that Milosevic is going to be judged in history books is of utmost importance . <P> Q. What about in the future ? <P> A. It 's possible . But this is more complicated than it 's been made out . The Serbs created a cult of personality around him , but that cult was made stronger by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you agree that Serbs committed war crimes in the 1990s and should be tried for those ? <P> A. Yes . But it 's a complicated matter . If the Croatian President had not tried to revive the idea of a Croatian independent state , the Serbs would not have rebelled and Milosevic would not have had a chance to abuse that . And when it comes to war crimes , there were war crimes committed by NATO last year . <P> Q. Can you envision an independent Kosovo ? <P> A. I can envision many things . But after that picture goes another picture : of the Albanians in Macedonia , in southern Serbia , in Montenegro and even in Greece . One should be pragmatic . There are some problems that you ca n't solve  --  like Jerusalem . <P> Q. Do you have a message for the U.S. ? <P> A. This is something very important . It is God 's will and punishment that we in Serbia and Montenegro are where we are . Sometimes we suffer because of our geopolitical position . But we are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was just abusing these sentiments . But we hope that the West will now understand us in that positive sense . <P> Q. Was the West a help or a hindrance in your victory ? <P> A. The West was not a hindrance , and now there is a chance for it to be a help . Some countries  --  France , Greece , some small Northern European countries  --  were particularly helpful . <P> Q. And the U.S. ? <P> A. This time they were not a hindrance .
