I have two options : Ram through the cars ( and risk wrecking my own in the process ) or spin around and speed away . I decide on the latter , just in time to see a third Caprice pull up alongside me . Its driver grins wickedly from behind the barrel of a Glock 9mm . I slap the transmission into reverse , stand on the accelerator pedal , and turn the wheel hard to the right . Rubber burns and tires squeal as my car careens into a 180-degree spin . The terrorist opens fire , painting my car , and then me , with bullets . I 'm dead before my car ever stops rotating . That moment 's hesitation , in which I evaluated my options like a rookie quarterback checking off receivers in the face of an oncoming pass rush , got me killed . But it 's far better to make such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glock than in an environment where attackers employ very real AK-47s . That 's why almost every U.S. government agency and military branch  --  including the FBI , CIA , U.S. Marshals , Department of Defense and Marines  --  as well as foreign governments and private companies , send their drivers to Bill Scott Racing 's anti-terrorist driving school in Summit Point , West Virginia , before stationing them abroad . Here , the automobile becomes both a weapon and a lifeline , and for the next two days , my classmates from the U.S. Army and the Hong Kong Police Department and I will learn how to put it to use against terrorist attacks ranging from carjackings to all-out assassination attempts . Scott , a former champion Formula Vee racer , began offering antiterrorist driving classes in 1976 after noticing a serious flaw in the way the U.S. government protected its people abroad . " They were doing a great job at protecting an ambassador in a cavalcade of cars and cops , " he says . " But not with the attach or the guy who was out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto-related terrorist attacks and designed a curriculum to arm the individual with the skills to survive one , skills like surveillance detection , fender-to-fender road combat , and executing 180-degree turns , as well as weapons training , shooting on the move ( one of the most difficult skills to master ) , and how to use a car for protection . " A high degree of emphasis is placed on avoiding the X , " says Scott , referring to the physical location where an attacker wants to corner you . If you can do that , " you 've taken a huge element of surprise away from the terrorist , and exploited one of his weaknesses . " Key to the training are the simulated environments created in the school 's 472-acre facility , which encompasses two road-racing courses ( a third will be added this spring ) , three shooting ranges , an explosives range and several close-quarter combat rooms . The three-lane asphalt tracks contain features such as grass , gravel and dirt shoulders , hills , blind curves , wooded areas , and paddocks with simulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban attack or rural ambush . " I ca n't reproduce desert , " he jokes , giving a sideways nod to the snowdrifts lining the course . " But short of that , we 're able to tailor the driving environment to what the student is likely to encounter . " Perhaps the trickiest maneuver Scott teaches is how to drive from the passenger 's seat . Once again I find myself facing a roadblock , only this time I 'm riding shotgun when the driver is shot dead . Not wanting to share his fate , I slide to the center of the car , slam the brakes with my left foot , throw the car into reverse , and hit the gas . When the speedometer reaches 40 mph , I stand on the brakes and spin the wheel . I shift back into drive mid-turn and floor the accelerator pedal when the car spins a full 180 degrees . From there , the roadblock fades in my rearview mirror . Scott and his team of 24 instructors  --  all of them former racecar drivers and military personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin another car . Forget all the Hollywood nonsense about ramming the back of a car , or slamming against it from the side  --  all that does is bend sheet metal . Instead , give the target vehicle a hard nudge between its rear wheelwell and back bumper . Alternately , if you find yourself the target of such an attack , protect that flank as if your life depended on it , because it just might . Speed up and swerve , so your attacker can only hit you in the back bumper , or slow down so he comes fully alongside . Such techniques are particularly well suited to the kind of opportunistic attacks that occur daily in Iraq and Afghanistan . " You get ambushed or sniped from a medium or short distance , " says Mike , a fellow student and U.S. Army captain who will head a team patrolling the countryside in Afghanistan . Making a quick escape is critical to survival , because such impromptu attackers are n't likely to have contingency plans for pursuit  --  they just want a shot at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class concentrates on how to leave your attackers in the dust , which for Scott translates into high-speed driving techniques like entering a corner at 70 mph and cutting through it such that you lose a bare minimum of speed . These lessons are n't unique to Scott 's curriculum ; you can learn the same skills at any high-performance driving school . But taught against the backdrop of international terrorism , which amounted to 199 attacks in 2002 alone ( 77 of them pointedly anti-American ) , these skills take on a whole new dimension . " Without training , your chances of escaping a terrorist ambush without being injured or kidnapped are about 1 in 10 , " says Scott . " With training , your chances are 6 in 10 of coming out safely . " SIDEBAR ADVENTURE GUIDE SPY VS .
