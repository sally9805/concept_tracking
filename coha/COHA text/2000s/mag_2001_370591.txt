In art , things go in and out of focus  --  including beauty . Twenty-five years ago , if an American painter or sculptor , when asked what he wanted to achieve , had replied " Beauty , " he might well have earned a double take as a mere decorator . ( Decorators were always " mere " back then . ) Art was meant to issue political challenges , to confront convention , et cetera . And a lot of truly lousy , polemical art lay in that et cetera . <P> But today the hopes of protest and politically irritant art have gone flat . Isms and groups have largely ceased to matter . What count for much more are those stubborn talents to whom the lyrical and the private are likely to be of more value than the collective . To such artists , beauty without cliche is a supreme goal , and there is probably none around who exemplifies this shift better than the sculptor Martin Puryear . <P> The best sculptors , of course , have always valued craft : good making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities were delegated to fabricators , as in most Minimalism . But the special intensity of Puryear 's work comes from doing everything himself , mainly in wood ( though tar , mud and wire also figure in his repertoire ) . Through the action of the shaping hand on wood , he brings forth a poetry of material substance that 's unique in today 's America . Puryear has always been troubled by the art/craft division in American culture . " At bottom it 's a class issue really , " he says . " ' Art ' means thought ; ' craft ' means manual work . " But it 's never so simple , for craft means thinking with ( not just about ) material . " In Japan you 'll never see that kind of snobbery ; potters and carpenters are honored there as living national treasures . " <P> But for the viewer , the work 's craft ancestry promotes a confidence in looking at it . Puryear 's shapes come out of several parallel worlds of form , which , when prolonged , actually do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial : the vigorous and noble shapes of what are now antique technologies , such as the carved wooden forms once created by casting patternmakers . Another is folk technology : basket weaving , canoe building , the construction of tents , yurts and kites . ( Puryear had some conventional art-school training at Catholic University of America in Washington in the early ' 60s , but he also worked with African carpenters in a remote village in Sierra Leone as part of a Peace Corps program , and an important part of his aesthetic education came in 1966 , studying with one of the great American furniture makers , James Krenov . ) Sometimes his pieces resemble hybrids of basketry and cooperage . A beautiful example is Brunhilde , 1998-2000 , an open-form cage of intricately fitted cedar slats , a mysterious baglike structure that seems to inflate with breath  --  like a Wagnerian soprano , says Puryear , filling her lungs for the big aria . And then there are the purely organic forms , which derive from nests , seedpods , flower stems , birds ' bones or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Plenty 's Boast , 1994-95 . As the title suggests , it could be a cornucopia . But it also evokes a slew of other things : the flaring mouth suggests an old gramophone horn , or perhaps a flower , or a weird sucking worm ; the " tail " has a distinctly sinister look , as though it carried a sting , while the fitting and fairing of the wooden staves of which it is made are impeccable .
