<p> There are two species of journalists at Cannes , described by the festival as critics or chroniclers . The critics review the films . The chroniclers write the gossip , review the fashions , attend the press conferences and pray for scandal . One year , Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren ( remember them ? ) got in a pushing match on the steps of the Palais , and the chroniclers dined out for a week . The critics , however , savor moments of quieter savagery , as when Dogma founder Lars von Trier did n't win the top prize from a jury headed by Roman Polanski , and accepted his lesser award " with no thanks to the midget . " <p> Everything is so urgent at Cannes . Films seem so supremely important for a week . There is a major scandal when a three-hour documentary about the Cinematheque Francais and its founder , Henri Langlois , ends in 1977 with Langlois ' death , and horreurs ! does not mention those who ran the Cinematheque in later years . " The Cinematheque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , " one overhears from the row behind , " but they will have their people at Le Monde attack it for them . " <p> Civic pride <p> The Cannes city hall has an entire wall covered with a photograph of the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar , whose competition opener " Bad Education " is a thriller about a gay movie director approached by a sometime transsexual who claims to be an old school chum . ( Imagine Chicago 's City Hall plastered with photos of John Waters , the director of " Hairspray . " ) <p> The Almodovar is followed by fireworks , which thundered in the wee hours of Friday morning , after a drag show and lots of food and wine . The party seems to continue on the screen Friday morning , with " Life Is a Miracle , " the new film by Emir Kusturica , which takes place in Bosnia in 1992 in a district where most of the locals travel by rail . But not in trains . <p> No , the local line does n't have a locomotive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lovesick mule , not knowing the trains have stopped , stands on the tracks trying to commit suicide . Dogs , cats , ducks , pigeons and chickens occupy the houses along with the characters . <p> The hero is a soccer star whose mother , an opera singer , is going mad , and sings passionately during a match where players appear and disappear in the fog . Drunken locals shoot bottles off each other 's heads . <p> There is a party that lasts all night . The local band is everywhere , providing an oom-pah-pah soundtrack for the revelry . Then war breaks out , the soccer star is taken prisoner , his family takes an enemy woman as prisoner in revenge , his father falls in love with her , and I heard someone wondering in the dark , " Is the real subject of this movie alcoholism ? " <p> I plunge out of the vast Lumiere theater , with 3,000 seats of rabid cineastes , and into the American Pavilion behind the Palais , where the waiters are film students who cheerfully try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two students : Does it teach you better discipline to shoot on film and edit by hand , instead of with a digital camera and computer editing ? By all means , we agreed . It focuses the mind wonderfully to be aware of the money going through the camera . <p> Not a seat in the house <p> Then it 's down the Croisette to the Noga Hilton , where the Directors ' Fortnight occupies a big theater seven flights of stairs below ground level . A disagreement breaks out with a festival guard , who tries to make us sit in the balcony when we all want to sit on the ground floor . " The ground floor is full ! " he intones . " There are hundreds of empty seats ! " we cry , for that is manifestly true . He replies with a masterpiece of French logic : " It is full for the moment . " <p> The movie is " Mean Creek , " by the American director Jacob Aaron Estes , and it is powerful and good . It tells the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat trip , and how their idea of a prank goes wrong . <p> But it is much more subtle than that . The bully had beaten up a smaller kid ( Rory Culkin ) , and so his older brother , his girlfriend and two other friends plan the revenge . But then they all take pity on the bully ( " We did n't know he would be so nice " ) , except for the oldest kid , who wants to follow the original plan . When the bully is almost spared , he unwisely explodes with violent insults , attacking the very one he should avoid . And then all of the kids have to deal with a hard and frightening moral choice . <p> I 've seen a lot of movies about teenagers who are violent and amoral ( " River 's Edge " and " Elephant " come to mind ) , but never one that commits so fully to kids trying to figure out the right thing to do in an impossible situation . <p> Back to the hotel for a power nap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best film I 've seen so far , " Moolaade , " by Ousmane Sembene , the legendary veteran from Senegal . It 's in Un Certain Regard , a sidebar section . " In the old days , " observes Telluride Film Festival director Tom Luddy , " it would have been in the main competition , but now they want something edgier . " <p> An audience in ecstasy <p> Edgy  --  one of the qualities Cannes has in overabundance . The Sembene film is set in a rural village in the present day . Four little girls come running to a local woman , asking for protection . They do not want to submit to ritual circumcision . The woman is known for having refused to let her daughter be mutilated . She grants them protection , or " moolaade , " over the protests of her husband , but with the support of his first and third wives . <p> The village men are much disturbed ; no man will marry an uncircumcised woman , they declare . But many girls bleed to death after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a standoff , much complicated by the return from Paris of a local man scheduled to marry the heroine 's daughter , only to learn she has not been cut . <p> At a time when ritual mutilation is under attack in Africa , when Islamic leaders have tried to explain it is not required by religious law but is a local custom , " Moolaade " is a strong , true and useful film . And it is magnificently beautiful , with its African vistas and brilliantly colored costumes , its full-throated music , and its faces of women who are real and have seen life and know their own strength . <p> Then it 's down to the Croisette again , to a happy hour hosted by the famous Bollywood director Subash Ghai , the Spielberg of India , who 's had 12 of the biggest blockbusters in India 's history , including " Taal . " That you have not heard of it does not mean millions did not love it . I saw it in a vast theater in Hyderabad , where the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes from his work in progress , " Kisna , the Warrior Poet , " about a " love that lives across two continents " between an Indian man and a British woman in the early 1940s in the foothills of the Himalayas . The lovers demonstrate an extraordinary ability to take heroic stances high on jagged peaks in front of dramatic orange sunsets , and one is reminded that Bollywood remembers what Hollywood forgets , that there is a hunger among audiences for the grand romantic gesture . <p> And then to the Debussy , merely 2,000 seats , to see the new Korean film " Old Boy . " The Croisette by now is jammed , boys perched in trees , some fans with their own stepladders , for a better look at the stars ascending the red carpet for the official showing of the Kusturica movie . Inside the Debussy , " Old Boy " is a bizarre film by Chan-wook Park , about a drunken man who awakens to find himself held captive for 15 years by faceless jailers who will not reveal their reasons . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the stumps , one at a time , that makes Laurence Olivier 's dentist in " Marathon Man " look like Painless Parker . But you have to concede : The movie is edgy.
