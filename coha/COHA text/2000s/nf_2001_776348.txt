A Doubtful Provenance // * * * // Churchill 's provenance was aristocratic , indeed ducal , and some have seen this as the most important key to his whole career . That is unconvincing . Churchill was far too many faceted , idiosyncratic and unpredictable a character to allow himself to be imprisoned by the circumstances of his birth . His devotion to his career and his conviction that he was a man of destiny were far stronger than any class or tribal loyalty . There have been politicians of high duty and honour  --  Edward Halifax and Alec Douglas-Home immediately spring to mind  --  who did see life through spectacles much bounded by their landed background . But Churchill was emphatically not among them . Apart from anything else , he never had any land beyond his shaky ownership ( and later only occupation ) of the 300 acres surrounding Chartwell , the West Kent house only twenty-four miles from London which he bought in 1922 and just managed , with financial subventions from friends , to cling on to for the remaining four decades of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlborough heritage was not one which stood very high in esteem , record of public service or secure affluence . The family had a memorable swashbuckling founder in John Churchill , the victor in the first decade of the eighteenth century of the battles of Blenheim , Ramillies , Oudenaarde and Malplaquet , who acquired a fine mansion among other rewards . But even this first Duke , although he inspired Winston Churchill to write four resonant volumes of praise ( and of refutation of the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay 's criticism ) just over 200 years after his death , was as famous for ruthless self-advancement as he was for martial prowess ; and the house , as its name of Blenheim Palace implies and as its size-enhancing Vanburgh architecture was dedicated to achieving , was showy even by the standards of the time . // Subsequent holders of the dukedom contributed little distinction and much profligacy . In 1882 , when the seventh in the line had been reached , Gladstone , who in general had an excessive respect for dukes , claimed that none of the Marlboroughs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family name was added by the second , third or fourth Dukes . The fifth was a talented gardener , but he seriously dissipated the Marlborough fortune and had to abandon the fine subsidiary estate ( now the site of Reading University ) where he had exercised his botanical skills . The sixth was almost equally extravagant . The seventh , who was the father of Lord Randolph and hence the grandfather of Winston Churchill , made the nearest approach to respectability and a record of public service . He was an MP for ten years , Lord President of the Council under both Derby and Disraeli in 1867-8 , and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for the last four years of Disraeli 's second government . // As a father this seventh Duke 's record was at once more dramatic and more mixed . On the one hand he produced a two-generation dynasty which made the name of Churchill resound throughout Britain 's national life in a way that it had not done since the death of the first Duke in 1722 . On the other , the resonance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meretricious note to it . And Lord Randolph 's elder brother was , in the words of an eminent modern historian , ? one of the most disreputable men ever to have debased the highest rank in the British peerage ? . He appropriately bore the name of Blandford , the title of the Marlborough heir , for most of his relatively short life , during which he was expelled from Eton , got caught up in two sexual scandals , one of which involved him in a violent quarrel with the Prince of Wales ( in which quarrel the fault may not have been unilateral ) , and sold off , as a short-term staunching operation , the formidable Marlborough picture collection . About his only constructive act was to install electric light and a rudimentary form of central heating at Blenheim . That was paid for by his second wife , who as a rich American provided sustaining dollars and began a strong Churchill family tradition of looking matrimonially westward . This example was followed by both his son , the ninth Duke , Winston Churchill 's cousin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his younger brother ( Lord Randolph Churchill ) , who married one ( Winston Churchill 's mother ) . The fortune of the father of Lady Randolph was however a little precarious . Furthermore he was unwilling to contribute much of it to the sustenance of the Churchill family . // Since the eighth Duke there have been another three Marlboroughs . Of these subsequent three , while they rose somewhat above the level of the eighth Duke , it is difficult to find much that is positive to say . Winston Churchill 's family background , while nominally of the highest aristocracy , was subtly inferior to that of a Cavendish , a Russell , a Cecil or a Stanley . // He was born on 30 November 1874 and , mainly by accident , at the very core of this slightly doubtful purple  --  in Blenheim Palace , although in a singularly bleak-looking bedroom . The accident arose out of his being two months premature . He should have been born in January in the small but fashionable house in Charles Street , Mayfair which his father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as a base for the somewhat rackety metropolitan life of which Lord Randolph and his bride of only seven and a half months ' standing were equally fond . This house not being ready , they had taken autumn refuge in Blenheim , and , as Lord Randolph put it in a letter to his mother-in-law in Paris , ? She Lady Randolph had a fall on Tuesday walking with the shooters , and a rather imprudent and rough drive in a pony carriage brought on the pains on Saturday night . We tried to stop them , but it was no use. ? Neither the London obstetrician nor his Oxford auxiliary could arrive in time , although it was over twenty-four hours to the birth from the onset of the labour pains , and the baby was born very early on the Monday morning with the assistance only of the Woodstock country doctor . Both mother and baby survived this paucity of attention perfectly healthily  --  as did the local doctor , who whether as a result or not was able himself to migrate to a London practice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston Churchill 's arrival in the world was done in a hurry . Perhaps Lord Randolph 's most remembered phrase ( and phrases were his strongest suit ) was his description of Gladstone as ? an old man in a hurry ? . His own style was at least equally that of a young man in a hurry , almost in a constant frenzy of impatience , and perhaps rationally so , for , although thirty-nine years his junior , he predeceased Gladstone by three years . The hurry was pre-eminently true of his courtship of Miss Jennie Jerome . They first met at a Cowes regatta shipboard party on 12 August 1873 and became engaged to be married three days later . // There then intervened the only period of semi-stasis in the saga . The Jerome family were in fact a very suitable American family for a Marlborough alliance . Leonard Jerome was a New York financial buccaneer . Winston Churchill , in his still highly readable although hagiographic 1905 biography of his father , was to describe Jerome as having ? founded and edited the New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Jerome had briefly in the course of some financial deals been a part proprietor of the Times . But what he was strong in was not newspaper publishing but horse racing , having founded both the Jerome Park track and the Coney Island Jockey Club . There was a touch of Joseph P. Kennedy about him . There was even a suggestion that he named his second daughter after Jenny Lind , the ? Swedish nightingale ? ( although the spelling was different ) , who was his current principal inamorata . He was pleased at the idea of this second daughter marrying an English duke 's son ( even if he was not the heir ) , but not to the extent of being willing , in the joke which John F. Kennedy was to make about his father 's financing of the 1960 Presidential campaign , ? to pay for a landslide ? . The seventh Duke was at first opposed to the whole idea of the union , being unimpressed by the uncontrolled precipitateness of his son 's passion , and believing moreover that ? this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should think vulgar kind of man ? , who was evidently ? of the class of speculators ; he has been bankrupt twice ; and may be so again ? . Over the autumn the Duke was brought reluctantly to overcome these objections of principle by his son 's determination . He was the first but by no means the last of the Marlboroughs to have to deal with the fathers of American heiresses and he set a pattern of believing that the least consuegros could do for the honour of such a noble alliance was generously to finance it . // There were however two difficulties . First , Leonard Jerome , true to the Duke 's descriptions of the hazards of his occupation , was in a speculative downturn . He had been badly mauled by the plunge of the New York stock exchange of that year ( 1873 ) . Second , he claimed to hold advanced New World ideas about the financial rights of married women . ( This was before the British Married Women 's Property Act of I882 gave women any property rights against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained would be under the exclusive control of his son . Jerome thought it should be settled on his daughter . This led to a good deal of haggling which went on into the spring of 1874 . Eventually a compromise was reached , by which Jerome settled a sum of ? 50,000 ( approximately ? 2.5 million at present values ) , producing an income of ? 2,000 a year , with a half of both capital and income belonging to the husband and a half to the wife . The Duke settled another ? 1,100 a year for life on Randolph which gave the couple the equivalent of a present-day income of a little more than ? 150,000 a year , a sum which guaranteed that they would live constantly above their income and be always in debt . // As soon as this settlement was reached they were married , on 15 April 1874 . It can not be said that the wedding took place en beaut ? . It was not at Woodstock , or in a suitable London church , or a Fifth Avenue equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jeromes attended and were among the very few witnesses , but neither Marlborough parent did ; Blandford represented the family . However there was no ostracism at home . The couple were welcomed at Blenheim and in May were given a public reception in Woodstock , for which small family borough Lord Randolph had been first and fairly narrowly elected a member of Parliament at the general election of February 1874 . He was twenty-five years of age at the time both of his election and of the birth of Winston Churchill . Jennie Churchill was twenty . // She had passed most of her adolescence in Paris , which Mrs Jerome appeared to prefer to New York , was considered a beauty and had already attracted much admiration before she met Lord Randolph . Her looks were undoubtedly striking , but what emerges most clearly from many photographs is that she quickly assumed an appearance which was hard , imperious and increasingly self-indulgent . Her performance as a wife , and indeed as a mother , was at least as mixed as that of the seventh Duke of Marlborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basis of mutual passion . Although they both liked a fashionable London life she accepted with calmness and even contentment the three years of virtual exile to Dublin which followed from her husband 's 1876 quarrel ( over a lady , but on his brother 's , not his own , part ) with the Prince of Wales . Her second son , Jack , was born in the Irish capital at the beginning of 1880 . There has long been a strong suggestion that this boy had a different father from Winston Churchill , although this did not prevent the two brothers being close at various periods of their lives , notably in South Africa at the turn of the century and at the peak of Winston Churchill 's career in the Second World War , when he accommodated the widowered Jack in 10 Downing Street . The most romantic candidate for alternative parenthood was Count Charles Kinsky , an Austrian diplomat of high aristocratic connection and of a proud elegance reminiscent of Sargent 's portrait of Lord Ribblesdale . Lady Randolph was much taken up with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving him a procreative role ; he did not arrive in London until 1881 . If the legitimacy of Jack Churchill is challenged , a more likely candidate seems to be the Dublin-based Colonel John Strange Jocelyn , who succeeded his nephew as the fifth Earl of Roden later in the year 1880 . He was thirty years older than Lady Randolph , but that was no necessary bar . // She looked after her husband rather well during a protracted illness which effectively took him out of politics from the spring to the autumn of 1882 , and very well during the last tragic three years or so of disintegration before his death at the beginning of 1895 . But the couple were effectively estranged over much of the 1880s , including the years of his short political apogee . She , like Queen Victoria , did not know of his disastrous 1886 resignation from the Chancellorship of the Exchequer until she read it in The Times . During these years she had many suitors , more than a few of them probably lovers . They included apart from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French novelist Paul Bourget and King Milan of Serbia . George Moore , the Anglo-Irish novelist , said she had 200 lovers , but apart from anything else the number is suspiciously round . She claimed to have firmly rejected the overtures of Sir Charles Dilke , which however did not prevent Lord Randolph , who appeared mostly to be more tolerant , from attempting to assault him . // After Lord Randolph 's death her choice of partners became more bizarre as well as more public . In 1900 , at the age of forty-six , she insisted on marrying George Cornwallis-West , a Scots Guards subaltern who was twenty years her junior . The marriage lasted fourteen years before ending in divorce . Cornwallis-West clearly had considerable drawing power , for he then married Mrs Patrick Campbell . Three years later Lady Randolph made a third marriage to Montague Porch , an hitherto quiet Somerset country gentleman who had been a Colonial Service officer in Nigeria and who was even younger than Cornwallis-West . She died in 1921 , aged sixty-seven . Porch survived until 1964. // Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder son 's most famous comment on their early relationship sounds a note at once admiring and wistful . After citing an adulatory passage ( in which the most striking phrase was nonetheless ? more of the panther than of the woman in her look ? ) written by the future Lord D'Abernon after first seeing her during the Irish period , Winston Churchill commented : ? My mother made the same brilliant impression upon my childhood 's eye . She shone for me like the Evening Star . I loved her dearly  --  but at a distance. ? This was in My Early Life ( that is up to 1906 ) which he published in 1930 , and is probably the most engaging of all his books , using a light and sparkling note of detached irony . The fact that these sentences were written and published nearly fifty years after the period to which they refer gives them a greater not a lesser validity . // They are moreover borne out by the correspondence of the period . Throughout his two years at his first preparatory school ( St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent testimonies of Churchill himself and of the art critic Roger Fry to have been a place of appalling brutality even by the flogging standards of the age ) , his subsequent three and a half years at a much gentler Brighton establishment , and then his nearly five years at Harrow , there is a constant hoping for visits which did not take place , of wishing for more attention in the future , and of being shunted around rather than of being automatically welcomed at home for short or long holidays . // The forms of letter address are also interesting . Churchill most frequently began his ? My darling Mummy ? and ended more variously . A fairly typical second-year Harrow example was ? Good Bye , my own , with love I remain , Your son Winston S Churchill ? . She habitually wrote to him , not too infrequently but mostly shortly , ? Dearest Winston ? and ended ? Yr loving Mother JSC ? . // There were two competitors for writing to him at least equally or more affectionate letters . The first was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in her mid- to late forties , who wrote often , mostly starting ? Dearest Winston ? and ending , more significantly ? With best love , Yr ever affecte , deputy mother , Laura Wilton ? . The other was Churchill 's nurse , Mrs Everest , who was engaged to look after him ( and later his brother Jack ) within a month or so of his birth . Elizabeth Everest was from the Medway Towns , and one of her lasting influences was to make Churchill feel that Kent was the best county in England . She would have approved ( more than Clementine Churchill did ) of his acquiring Chartwell twenty-seven years after her death . Before coming to the Churchills she had looked after the small daughter of a Cumberland clergyman , whom Winston retrieved after twenty years to join him at her graveside. // Mrs Everest obviously possessed among other attributes great descriptive power , for she made life in that northern parsonage so vivid to Churchill that , although vicarious , it was one of his most permanent early memories . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that her ? Mrs ? was purely honorary , like that of many a housekeeper of the period . Although she had a sister ( who was married to a prison warder in the Isle of Wight ) , to whose house she once took Winston to stay , thus giving him , it has been suggested , his only experience of humble life , she was able to concentrate almost all her affection upon the two Churchill boys . She was the central emotional prop of Winston 's childhood , and mutual dependence continued throughout his adolescence . The Randolph Churchills had not kept her on after the end of Jack 's childhood , but Winston at least maintained strong contact and visited her several times in her final illness . // Mrs Everest 's letters to Churchill typically began ( 21 January 1891 , when he was sixteen ) ? My darling Winny ? and ended ? Lots of love and kisses Fm your loving old woom ? . A typical topping and tailing from him to her ( from Harrow , July 1890 ) was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope you will enjoy yourself , with love from Winny ? . One other person who used ? Winny ? ( or ? Winnie ? ) was Count Kinsky . On 5 February 1891 he wrote a letter from the Austro-Hungarian Embassy in Belgrave Square of which the content , as well as the salutations , was not without interest : ? I am sending you all the stamps I could scrape together for the moment . Do you want some more later on ? If so say so . How is your old head ? I hope all right again . I am off to Sandringham tomorrow until Monday . If I have a good thing racing you shall be on . I am going to lunch with Mama now so must be off . Be a good boy and write if you have nothing better to do ... Yours ever , CK ? . // Winston Churchill 's non-relationship with his father was even more wistful than was his semi-relationship with his mother . Lord Randolph was too exhilarated by politics during his period of success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his decline to have much time for parenthood . It is one of the supreme ironies that now , more than a century after his death , he should be best known as a father . In life it was always an intensely personal fame , sought and achieved , which was his forte , just as parenthood or any other form of domestic activity certainly was not . The most poignant comment on Winston Churchill 's relations with his father is that which he is reported to have made to his own son , another and by no means wholly satisfactory Randolph , in the late 1930s , when that Randolph was twenty-six or twenty-seven . They had a long and maybe fairly alcoholic dinner together , alone at Chartwell . Towards the end Churchill said : ? We have this evening had a longer period of continuous conversation together than the total which I ever had with my father in the whole course of his life. ? // ( Continues ... ) //                @ @ @ @ @
