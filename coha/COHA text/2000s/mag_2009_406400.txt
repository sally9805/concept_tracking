When San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and philanthropist Gordon Getty created their new winery , on a sixty-acre mountainside plot overlooking the Napa Valley , they vowed that treading lightly on the land would be as important as making great Cabernet . " We really want to be respectful of the site and the environment , " says John Conover , partner and general manager of Cade Winery , which opened in April as the latest addition to Newsom and Getty 's PlumpJack Group .

FOREST FOR THE TREES During the past century and a half , logging and real-estate development have decimated America 's ancient redwood forests : of the original two million acres of these arboreal titans ranging from central California to southern Oregon , only 5 percent remain . Thanks to the San Francisco-based Save the Redwoods League , however , tens of thousands of acres of coast redwoods  --  200- to 300-foot-tall behemoths that can live for two millennia  --  and giant sequoias , with trunks ten yards wide , have been protected over the course of ninety-one years . With the aid of private contributions , the league develops various preservation programs , such as purchasing forests from timber companies and donating them to the California State Parks system ; it also gives research grants to scientists for studying what redwoods need to thrive . You can help by becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the most meaningful act is to plant a seedling in honor of a loved one ( $50 ) . " Redwoods are majestic , powerful and beautiful , " says executive director Ruskin Hartley . " But they 're also fragile : a logger can come in , and in one day they can be gone .
