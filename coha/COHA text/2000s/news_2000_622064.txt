<p> One fun thing about this column is that if I mention a problem or identify a need , and a solution is out there or coming soon , odds are someone 's going to bring it to my attention . <p> A few weeks ago , noting the enormous amount of computing horsepower now sitting on home and office PCs  --  most of it lying idle most of the day  --  I lamented that there was n't something more compelling to do with this resource than look for extraterrestrials or add digits to pi . <p> Well , it turns out that I was by no means alone  --  a slew of top-tier technical types have had the same idea , and they 're already building new businesses around it . They 're aiming to support a wider range of nonprofit research projects , including initiatives in health , biodiversity and environment modeling . <p> But the new projects include commercial possibilities . The idea is that companies in fields like animated movies , biotechnology and drug research , or perhaps government agencies trying to match fingerprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their projects distributed across thousands or even millions of PCs . After all , SETI@home users , collectively , have already contributed more than 300,000 years of computer time  --  enough to be compelling even to well-heeled pharmaceutical companies . <p> Of course , no one expects users to contribute their processing time for commercial use without compensation . So the new distributed-computing startups are looking at a variety of ways to reward people for participating . Since cutting and mailing a check for each user every month probably wo n't make sense because the overhead would be prohibitive , they 're considering other forms of payment  --  contributions to electronic wallets , discounts from e-tailing partners or perhaps ISPs , maybe even frequent-flier miles . <p> Among these new companies , the farthest along appears to be a San Francisco operation called Popular Power ( www.popularpower.com ) . But there 's also Distributed Science ( **26;2018;TOOLONG ) , which combines two earlier projects , the commercial-oriented ProcessTree Network and a nonprofit called DCypher.net . The combined operation is based in Madison , Ala. , outside Huntsville . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas , enters the field ( www.ud.com ) . Its biggest claim to fame : Its chief technical officer is David Anderson , organizer and director of SETI@home . <p> Considering the stunning success of that project  --  not at finding intelligence elsewhere in the universe , but at demonstrating the viability of what might be called massively distributed computing  --  Anderson 's reputation and contacts are powerful assets for the new company . I 'm told he 's known in some circles as a " geek rock star . " <p> But the folks behind Popular Power are hardly slouches . Chief executive Marc Hedlund used to run Lucasfilm 's Internet division ; the chief technology officer , Nelson Minar , formerly worked on distributed-computing applications at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Media Lab . <p> The group 's angel investors include Brian Behlendorf , CTO and founder of Collab.net and president of the Apache Software Foundation ( the open-source collaboration that produces the world 's most widely used Web server ) ; Max Metral , CTO of PeoplePC and former CTO of Firefly Networks ; and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has developed client software that , unlike SETI@home , is not hard-coded for one particular project ; a beta version for Windows is available now from the company 's site , and Mac and Linux versions are due soon . The initial Popular Power project , to which you can start contributing today , is in the nonprofit category : It involves simulating interactions among influenza-virus variants and alternative vaccines and vaccination strategies , to help scientists come up with the optimal vaccine for next year 's flu season . <p> Although Popular Power has n't launched any commercial projects , its software will let users choose to devote their machine entirely to nonprofit projects or to commercial work , or to split it in various proportions . Eventually , we 'll probably be able to choose specific projects from a menu of alternatives . <p> Plans for compensating participants are n't settled yet , but Hedlund said a user who makes a relatively up-to-date PC available 12 hours a day might earn $5 to $15 a month . At least for now , Popular Power 's screen-saver graphics are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to a constructive , this-worldly cause and/or make a few bucks , might be enough to overcome that disadvantage . <p> United Devices is even further from finalizing its payment plans , but one idea that has garnered a lot of interest in its focus groups , according to CEO Ed Hubbard , is giving contributors virtual sweepstakes tickets . <p> Hubbard , who worked at Microsoft Corp . and Intel Corp . before a recent stint at Dell Computer Corp. , also hopes for advertising support : SETI@home users , it turns out , love to study the comparative performance data that the project posts at its site , and Hubbard thinks so many United Devices users will eventually do the same that computer-makers and others will happily pay to advertise on the UD site . <p> Aside from the compensation issues , these companies have some serious technical challenges that SETI@home has n't had to face . For commercial jobs , there 's the problem of security  --  customers are n't going to be interested in distributing their projects to unknown PC users around the world unless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Execs at the distributed-computing startups , however , are well aware of this issue , and they tell me they 'll have solutions that should set potential clients ' minds at rest . <p> In a year or two , it appears that our collective gigaflops will be doing a little more for the world than they are today  --  and maybe even helping us pay for them . <p> GOOD NEWS ON THE WIRELESS FRONT : Readers interested in building a wireless local area network around the house or office  --  so you can surf the Web from your couch or a conference room  --  will be happy to hear that prices for gear based on the hot new 802.11b standard are coming down . <p> In particular , we 're about to see a breakthrough in pricing for PC-friendly base stations . These contraptions , also known as network access points , serve as the hub for a wireless LAN and connect it to the Internet either by modem or , via Ethernet , through a DSL , cable or other high-speed link . <p> A regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ISA card installed can serve the same function , but a separate base station has a big advantage : It means you can get online from a wireless-equipped notebook at any time without having to leave your desktop PC running constantly . <p> As you may recall from my last column on the subject , most 802.11b base stations cost more than $1,000 ; no PC-oriented networking company came close to Apple 's $299 price for its flying-saucer-shaped AirPort Base Station . Although it is possible to get PC notebooks online through the AirPort product , setting up this configuration is a little too complicated for non-geek tastes . <p> Now , however , Lucent Technologies Inc. has started shipping its 802.11b base station , dubbed the Orinoco Residential Gateway , and pricing is n't too bad : list for a complete , functioning unit plus an extra card for a notebook is $449 . <p> Meanwhile , other companies are now hard at work on even less expensive equivalents . Next month , for example , Linksys , a leading provider of networking equipment for home and small-business users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just $249 , along with a $99 wireless PC Card , a $119 PCI version and a $119 external USB adapter . They 'll all be marketed as part of the Linksys OnAirWireless series . <p> I have n't yet tested the products myself , but the specs look good  --  they include an encryption option , and Linksys says they 'll be compliant with Wi-Fi , the emerging standard that 's supposed to ensure compatibility among 802.11b products from various vendors . <p> 802.11b , remember , is a local-area-networking technology , not a wide-area one . It 's more like a cordless phone that works around the house than a cell phone you can , theoretically , use almost anywhere . <p> But with prices for 802.11b equipment tumbling and compatibility hopefully improving , this distinction could soon be blurred , as numerous companies are planning to install access points in airports , hotels and other public spaces . <p> Tech21 appears every Monday in The Chronicle .
