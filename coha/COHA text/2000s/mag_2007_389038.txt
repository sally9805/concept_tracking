When you 've got to haul a real load or tow a real trailer , only a real pickup will do . FEW VEHICLES ARE SO PERFECT for so many Americans as the full-size pickup . That 's why these big haulers have perennially been our nation 's best-selling vehicles . But now the creators of this quintessentially American icon  --  Ford , General Motors and Dodge  --  need to watch their rearview mirrors . Serious contenders from Nissan and Toyota have entered this last preserve of American market dominance with trucks of their own  --  trucks engineered and built here in the U.S. of A. As these latest Japanese entries have grown in size and power , we decided to compare them to the domestic stalwarts . We gathered a Ford F-150 ( the best-selling vehicle in the country ) , a Chevrolet Silverado , a Dodge Ram , a Toyota Tundra and a Nissan Titan . We specified the roomiest four-door cabs , biggest engines and , since half of all pickups sold are 4wd , that 's how we got them . We track tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo bed . We used them on road and off . Here 's what we found . 1 NISSAN VITALS BASE PRICE : $31,550 AS TESTED : $37,125 POWERTRAIN : 317 hp/385 lb. - ft. 5.6-liter V8 , 5A TIRES : BFGoodrich Rugged Trail T/A P285/70R17 WEIGHT : 5340 lb . EPA FUEL ECONOMY : 13/18 mpg TITAN SE THE LAST TIME WE COMPARED full-size pickups , in January 2004 , the Titan won . Since then , every other truck here has been redesigned . No matter  --  the Titan retains its title . At the dragstrip , with 1000 pounds in the bed , the Titan crossed the quarter-mile mark two-hundredths of a second after the rocket-sled Tundra . Though the Tundra has 64 more horsepower , the Titan weighs less . It 's the lightest truck here , which helped its fuel economy numbers . The Titan was midpack in all our handling tests , even though it had the tallest tires with the most aggressive off-road biased tread . Our test Titan is the best equipped for going off-road ; in fact , it was the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pushbutton locking rear differential . The Titan also has the most useful bed of the group , with huge , movable tiedown cleats , a bed liner and a unique bedside lockbox . Inside , the Titan is roomy and comfortable , rivaling the limousine-like Tundra for rear-seat legroom . The only major strike against the Nissan is the use of hard and cheap-looking interior plastics . Nonetheless , each night every tester wanted to drive the Titan back to the hotel .

EPA FUEL ECONOMY : 14/18 mpg TUNDRA CREWMAX LIMITED IF WE NEVER LEFT THE DRAGSTRIP , the Tundra would be the clear winner of this test . Our truck had Toyota 's new 5.7-liter i-Force V8 . This monster of a motor is the strongest of the bunch , and it comes paired to the only six-speed automatic in the test . Despite the Toyota 's weight  --  it 's the heaviest here  --  this truck ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Tundra was quicker 0 to 30 than the unladen Ram and the F-150 . It also had nearly the best brakes of the group . And any complaints about the previous Tundra 's skimpy size are gone . It 's huge , inside and out . Toyota 's CrewMax cab has the most comfortable rear seat in any pickup . Just recline and enjoy a DVD . It 's almost too posh back there for truck duty . Up front , the Tundra is cavernous , with plenty of storage space . However , all is not perfect when it comes to comfort . Over our test loop , which included many different types of secondary roads and freeways , the Tundra had the kind of jarring freeway hop that would make a Humvee blush . The rough-riding suspension hurt the Tundra through the handling tests , too . The Tundra 's prowess through the pylons was also hindered by its overprotective stability control system . The harder we pushed this truck , the more aggressively the stability control electronics shut it down . Worth noting : With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of pulling as any truck here .

EPA FUEL ECONOMY : 15/19 mpg SILVERADO CREW CAB LT2 GM RAISED THE BAR with the latest iteration of the Silverado and GMC Sierra . Given the competition , however , the bar did n't go high enough . And , in the end , the new GMs fall short of our expectations . There 's no complaint with the redesigned interiors . When we opened the door of our Silverado test truck , we were impressed by the quality materials and switches . But once we settled into the supportive driver 's seat , it was clear the cab was n't noticeably roomier than the previous model 's . Our disappointment grew on the track and on the road . Even though our test truck was optioned with the 6.0-liter Vortec Max V8  --  the largest engine in the test  --  the Chevy lost to both the Toyota and Nissan on the strip . What happened to American muscle ? Part of the problem was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Nissan and down two to the Toyota , its shifts were lethargic . Around town , the Chevy had the same type of easy-to-drive lan as the ' ' 06 Silverado . Like the Nissan , the Chevy drives smaller than it actually is . You can confidently wheel it into parking spots you would n't dare try in the Tundra or the Ford . Our truck had the NHT towing package that brings with it firmer rear springs to handle the 10,500-pound towing capacity . The ride quality should have been compromised ; happily , it was n't . The Silverado was one of our favorites on the freeway and rough roads . We still like the Chevy more than we did its predecessor , but less than we like the Nissan and Toyota .

EPA FUEL ECONOMY : 14/18 mpg F-150 KING RANCH HOW DOES THE BEST-SELLING TRUCK end up near the bottom of our rankings ? In a word  --  engine . Ford 's three-valve-per-cylinder 5.4-liter V8 made the F-150 slower to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toyota was nearly a staggering 3 seconds faster . All of the other trucks were quicker when carrying 1000 pounds than the Ford was empty . But that does n't mean Ford does n't know how to build a great truck . The F-150 out-stopped everything but the Tundra . It was also the best-handling pickup truck here , beating the others through the slalom and lane change . The Ford 's robust , fully boxed frame got credit for providing solid anchorage for the suspension and steering . However , extracting maximum handling from the F-150 took a skilled hand . Our King Ranch had the nicest interior of the bunch , with an easy-to-use navigation system , sunroof and power folding heated mirrors , and thick-cut saddle leather on the seats and center console . On the open road , the F-150 was quiet and comfortable , though not quite as smooth as the Nissan . But when put to work , the Ford 's extra-deep bed ( with no bed liner for $45K ! ) made loading a pain .

In nearly every respect , the Ram seemed dated , even though Dodge revamped its front suspension and the cab 's interior just last year . Adding insult was the Ram 's price : Our top of the line Laramie model cost $10,000 more than the better-equipped Nissan . Yikes . Dodge 's Quad Cab was much smaller than the others . It was a tight squeeze in the second row , and that back seat had the most upright and uncomfortable seat of all the trucks tested . The hard plastics and dour environment had us wondering what exactly justified that high sticker price . Unlike the Ford , the Ram had abundant torquey thrust . But even the mighty Hemi seemed overmatched by the Nissan and Toyota . Still , the Ram was no slug . Interestingly , when empty , it was slower than every truck but the F-150 , showing that it definitely needs weight over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were famous for their frugality : The Dodge delivered the worst fuel economy of our group . The steering was responsive , as the truck 's good showing in the lane change test showed . But scads of suspension travel  --  great for off-road  --  accounted for a bouncing , rocking ride . Off-road capability and good looks were not enough to overcome the Ram 's shortcomings .
