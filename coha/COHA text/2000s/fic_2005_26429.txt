Every time I see you I get a Sugar Rush You 're like candy You give me a Sugar Rush Do n't tell me stay on my diet You have simply got to try it Sugar Rush " Sugar Rush " Performed by Heather Wells Written by Valdez/Caputo From the album Sugar Rush Cartwright Records " Um , hello . Is anyone out there ? " The girl in the dressing room next to mine has a voice like a chipmunk . " Hello ? " Exactly like a chipmunk . I hear a sales clerk come over , his key chain clinking musically . " Yes , ma'am ? Can I help you ? " " Yeah . " The girl 's disembodied  --  but still chipmunklike  --  voice floats over the partition between our cubicles . " Do you guys have these jeans in anything smaller than a size zero ? " I pause , one leg in and one leg out of the jeans I am squeezing myself into . Whoa . Is it just me , or was that really existential ? Because what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? Okay , so it 's been a while since sixth grade math . But I do remember there was this number line , with a zero in the middle , and  --  " Because , " Less Than Zero/Chipmunk Voice is explaining to the sales clerk , " normally I 'm a size two . But these zeros are completely baggy on me . Which is weird . I know I did n't lose weight since the last time I came in here . " Less Than Zero has a point , I realize as I pull up the jeans I 'm trying on . I ca n't remember the last time I could fit into a size 8 . Well , okay , I can . But it 's not a period from my past that I particularly relish . What gives ? Normally I wear 12s . . . but I tried on the 12s , and I was swimming in them . Same with the 10s . Which is weird , because I have n't exactly been on any kind of diet lately  --  unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . But I 'm sure the bagel with cream cheese and bacon I had with it pretty much canceled out the Splenda . And it 's not exactly like I 've been to the gym recently . Not that I do n't exercise , of course . I just do n't do it , you know , in the gym . Because you can burn just as many calories walking as you can running . So why run ? I figured out a long time ago that a walk to Murray 's Cheese Shop on Bleecker to see what kind of sandwich they have on special for lunch takes ten minutes . And a walk from Murray 's over to Betsey Johnson on Wooster to see what 's on sale ( love her stretch velvet ! ) : another ten minutes . And a walk from Betsey 's over to Dean &; Deluca on Broadway for an after-lunch cappuccino and to see if they have those chocolate-covered orange peels I like so much : another ten minutes . And so on , until before you know it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's hard to comply with the government 's new fitness recommendations ? If I can do it , anyone can . But could all of that walking have caused me to drop two whole sizes since the last time I shopped for jeans ? I know I 've been cutting my daily fat intake by about half since I replaced the Hershey 's Kisses in the candy jar on my desk with free condoms from the student health center . But still . " Well , ma'am , " the sales clerk is saying to Less Than Zero . " These jeans are stretch fit . That means that you 've got to try two sizes lower than your true size . " " What ? " Less Than Zero sounds confused . I do n't blame her . I feel the same way . It 's like number lines all over again . " What I mean is , " the sales clerk says , patiently , " if you normally wear a size four , in stretch jeans , you would wear a size zero . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them , then ? " Less Than Zero  --  quite sensibly , I think  --  asks . " Like if a zero is a really a four , why do n't you just label it a four ? " " It 's called vanity sizing , " the sales clerk says , dropping his voice . " What sizing ? " Less Than Zero asks , dropping her voice , too . At least , as much as a chipmunk can drop her voice . " You know . " The sales clerk is whispering to Less Than Zero . But I can still hear him . " The larger customers like it when they can fit into an eight . But they 're really a twelve , of course . See ? " Wait . What ? I fling open the door to my dressing room before I stop to think . " I 'm a size twelve , " I hear myself saying to the sales clerk . Who looks startled . Understandably , I guess . But still . " What 's wrong with being a size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk , looking panicky . " Nothing at all . I just meant  --  " " Are you saying size twelve is fat ? " I ask him . " No , " the sales clerk insists . " You misunderstood me . I meant  --  " " Because size twelve is the size of the average American woman , " I point out to him . I know this because I just read it in People magazine . " Are you saying that instead of being average , we 're all fat ? " " No , " the sales clerk says . " No , that 's not what I meant at all . I  --  " The door to the dressing room next to mine opens , and I see the owner of the chipmunk voice for the first time . She 's the same age as the kids I work with . She does n't just sound like a chipmunk , I realize . She kind of looks like one , too . You know . Cute . Perky . Small enough to fit in a normal-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even making her size ? " I ask the sales clerk , jerking a thumb at Less Than Zero . " I mean , I 'd rather be average than not even exist . " Less Than Zero looks kind of taken aback . But then she goes , " Um . Yeah ! " to the sales clerk . Continues ...
