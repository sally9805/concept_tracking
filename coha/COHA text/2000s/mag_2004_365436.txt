No matter what you may have heard about her parenting skills , Paula Poundstone considers herself a fairly typical single mother . She helps with homework , reads bedtime stories and spends endless hours chauffeuring her three kids , ages 13 , 10 and 6 . But she does acknowledge certain aberrations . In her current act , the comedian jokes that one of the videos they all watch together is One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . " Against that backdrop , " she says , " Mom looks pretty good . " <P> The line scores well , in part because it helps dispel the tension of audience members , few of whom could have missed the fact that three years ago , Poundstone , 44 , was embroiled in a lurid scandal . In 2001 her children , all of whom are adopted , were removed from her custody when she was arrested on a felony charge of child endangerment for driving under the influence with her kids in the car . However disturbing the conviction , it paled next to allegations that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the unforgettable words of the court , " committed a lewd act upon a minor , " charges that , with little fanfare , were later dropped . Poundstone regained custody of her children after a court-ordered six-month stay in a rehab center , but she remains on probation and is required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous ( A.A. ) . <P> As career enders go , her transgressions dwarfed the infractions of stars like the shoplifting Winona Ryder or the philandering Hugh Grant . But unlike Grant , who publicly  --  and effectively  --  offered contrition , Poundstone refuses to pander to win back her audience . " I was sentenced to A.A. on national television , " she says during her routine . " That pretty much blows the hell out of the second A. " She refers to rehab as " stupid " and argues that not only have A.A. meetings proved ineffective , but it was unconstitutional for a judge to compel her to attend . " I 'm an atheist , " she says . " Everyone tries to say that God is not a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have to turn yourself over to a higher power . " <P> Still , she does n't deny her role in events . " I see now there were signs , " she says , " but I was drunk , so they were kind of blurry and went by really fast . " If her show sounds like a downer , it 's not . Though she has never been the kind of comic to stack up one-liners , she manages , over two rambling hours , to take aim at the standard fodder  --  politicians , pets , audience members  --  in the same slightly exasperated and self-mocking tone that made her such a success in the 1990s when she played large auditoriums and had two HBO specials and ( briefly ) her own talk show on ABC . <P> The venues are smaller now , but the bookings are picking up . Most of the 54 dates on her current tour are sold out , and she scored what seemed like the ultimate absolution in July when she was invited to perform on the Late Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally , she manages to wring considerable humor out of being a felon ( one of her best-received jokes is a line about being an important element of her Neighborhood Watch ) . " All I want is to be entertaining , " she says . " I do n't have any great lessons to share , except this : get your criminal attorney now . Should something go south , you wo n't have the luxury of shopping around . "  --  By Michele Orecklin
