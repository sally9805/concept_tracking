IF YOU 'RE A LITTLE-LET 'S FACE IT-BORED WITH RIDING 100 MILES ON THE ROAD , PULL ON YOUR BAGGIES AND JOIN THE NEWEST OFF-ROAD CRAZE . THE CLANG OF A GONG WAKES ME AT 5:30 a.m . Moving nothing but my eyelids , I stare up at the cathedral pitch of my tent . The gong sounds again , and again , and each peal reminds me of another aspect of my upcoming day : a mountain bike , 101 miles , the humid August woods and the rock gardens of the race course , in State College , Pennsylvania . I 'd like to take that gong and toss it like a Frisbee . I am at the Wilderness 101 mountain bike race , the original off-road century . The huge loop-one lap-includes winding singletrack , fire roads , descents strewn with jagged rocks , creek crossings and jutting roots , not to mention 10,000 feet of elevation gain . For this , race promoter Chris Scott has drawn an astounding 300-plus entrants , more than I 've lined up with at many 25-mile weekend events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries represent the fastest-growing segment of competitive mountain hiking in the United States , according to nationwide registration tallies . In 2006 , what seems to have been the breakthrough year for these events , overall race attendance increased 37 percent and the National Ultra Endurance MTB Series was founded . This year , about 20 off-road centuries were run . Part of the success stems from the surprising accessibility of what might appear to be an extreme event . Far from intimidating , the vibe of dirty centuries evokes the camaraderie of off-roading 's original explosion in popularity . " You find a festive atmosphere reminiscent of the early ' ' 90s mountain bike scene , " says Scott . " Participants camp , eat and drink merrily together . They spend all day on an epic journey . " The 101 's start line , for instance , is host to everyone from college kids to grandfathers ( though most are men 25 to 35 ) , and plenty of people who look not as if they 're racing for first but as if they 'll achieve their goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road century and do n't want to get stuck in the infinite spiral of judging improvement by everfaster times , riding a pavement-free 100-miler offers a fulfilling challenge . And you never have to worry about traffic . MY MUSINGS ARE INTERRUPTED BY ONE MORE bang of the gong-the loud , ceremonial clang that officially starts our journey . For the first several miles , the mass of bikes sticks together as we pedal at a relaxed pace . Then we hit the first stretch of winding singletrack and begin to split up . This is my fourth Wilderness 101 , so I know that if everything goes as planned , I should cross the finish line within eight hours . MY FIRST RACE HERE , IN 2002 , CAME 11 YEARS AFTER the 101 's incarnation . In 1991 , Randy Moore , a bike-shop owner from State College , teamed up with Jim Bryant , an enthusiastic local mountain biker , to organize the first-ever dirty century . " I wanted the intellectual exercise of designing a 100-mile race that crossed only one road , " says Bryant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The local coroner served as master of ceremonies , which was convenient : For race numbers , he brought a body bag full of toe tags . Logistical difficulties , such as marking 100 miles of trail and finding enough volunteers to cover the route , forced Bryant and Moore to kill the race in ' ' 93 . Eight years later , Scott resurrected it , in time to be part of the miniboom in endurance off-roading . In 2004 the UCI , cycling 's worldwide governing body , instituted a Marathon World Championship race and title . NEAR THE END OF THE 101,1 RIDE INTO A STONE tunnel and slosh through 3 inches of water , bumping off scattered rocks I ca n't see . The light at the end of the tunnel reminds me that this is the last challenge . When I pop out onto the gravel road , no more obstacles stand in the way of my first Wilderness 101 win . But even though no racers are close behind me , I pick up the pace , sprinting across the finish line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I swing the mallet at the gong , letting everyone within earshot know that the first rider has finished . The echo carries on and on . This morning , the gong said many things , but now it says just one : Go back to bed . Sidebar YOUR FIRST UNPAVED HUNDRED When I tell other cyclists that not only do I compete in 100-mile mountain bike races but I think they could , too , most of them are shocked . But it 's true . While a dirty century is tougher than most road centuries , finishing is an obtainable goal for a reasonably fit cyclist who 's not unfamiliar with spending seven to 10 hours in the saddle . All good dirty centuries have four to six support stations stocked with food , water and first-aid equipment . To increase the chance of finishing within the time cut , I advise first-timers to look for courses with less than 50 percent singletrack . I think one of the best for novices is Ducktown , Tennessee 's Cohutta 100 , run each April . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that follows a single loop around the Cohutta Wilderness Area in the Cherokee and Chattahoochee National Forests . Info : **25;5103;TOOLONG .
