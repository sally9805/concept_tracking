IPods and other handheld gadgets have made art , books , music and film more accessible than ever . Edited by Sarah Medford THE AUDIO TOUR , UPDATED Boston 's Institute of Contemporary Art ( ICA ) is full of surprises  --  and not just the gravity-defying cantilever of the museum 's recently opened Diller Scofidio &; Renfro-designed headquarters . A glance into the new galleries reveals throngs of visitors with white headphones planted firmly in their ears and Apple iPods cradled in their hands . They 're not listening to Tchaikovsky while checking out the Julian Opie ; they 're listening to the ICA 's audio guide . Some downloaded it from the museum 's Web site at home , in anticipation of their visit ; others rented preloaded iPods once they arrived at the ICA . In either case , their use of digital media signifies a sea change in how art institutions are delivering  --  and indeed conceiving of  --  their audio interpretation tools . Museums are taking advantage of iPods and related technological innovations to create and provide a whole new variety of aural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other museums have made their audio guides available on their Web sites ( some even on Apple 's iTunes Music Store ) , ready for anyone to point , click and download for free , whether or not users plan to visit . Photograph : Illustrations by Edwin Fotheringham And because art institutions are increasingly producing these digital guides themselves , instead of turning to an outside service as in the past , they 've found it easier to reimagine their audio offerings and expand them to " capture a lot of different voices and open up dynamic interpretations of the material , " says Sara Bodinson , an educator in charge of audio programming at the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) in New York City . These varied voices provide insights that a scripted narrator often could not . At the ICA , for example , Barbara Lee , a major benefactor of the museum and a member of its board of trustees , reveals how she came to acquire a seminal Nan Goldin photograph that she subsequently donated to the institution . And for " WACK ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Museum of Contemporary Art ( MOCA ) in Los Angeles , twenty-six artists  --  not least of all Judy Chicago  --  recorded in-depth commentary on their pieces in the show . For their part , artists are more than happy to play along . " Many are pleasantly surprised that we are giving them this opportunity , rather than having a curator speak about their work , " says Bodinson . Museums are also making greater use of music on these digital tours , adding another layer to the listening experience . For an installation and retrospective of his work opening next month at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ( SFMOMA ) , the multimedia artist Olafur Eliasson will create , along with the museum , an ambient sound track as part of an audio experience tied to the exhibit . But inventive audio tours are only one part of the aural revolution . Cultural institutions of all sorts are supplementing these tours with podcasts , or regularly posted digital audio content that you download to your computer ( and then , if you want , onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your leisure . Think of them as audio art magazines . Unlike audio guides , which lead a listener through one museum exhibit , podcasts often provide more general information . They allow you to experience a museum from afar , whether that means just across town or across the Atlantic . " We think of our podcasts as a way of projecting art ideas out into the community , beyond the museum 's walls , " says Peter Samis , associate curator for analog and digital interpretation at SFMOMA . His museum 's award-winning " Artcast " podcasts feature a series of recurring sections , just as your favorite periodical would . These include Artists ' Voices , in which artists discuss their oeuvres ; Guest Take , in which nonvisual artists ( musicians , actors , dancers , etc. ) respond to a work on view at the museum ; and Vox Pop , in which museum visitors talk about what they 've seen there . Institutions are also turning their live public events into podcasts . MOCA makes its " Art Talks " series of artist- and curator-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MoMA does the same , posting the material online as part of its " Think Modern " series . The trend goes beyond contemporary- and modern-art museums ; such comprehensive institutions as the Museum of Fine Arts , Houston ; the Philadelphia Museum of Art ; and even the Metropolitan Museum of Art , in New York , are all using iPods in one way or another . And international museums , including the Chteau de Versailles and London 's Victoria and Albert , are joining in as well . Emma Fernandez , the ICA educator , applauds the changes that digital media have wrought : " I think traditional museum audio gave a one-way interpretation . But when we use the technology to allow for more dialogue- and commentary-style content , we create an interesting conversation with the visitor . " In other words , it 's time for gallery-goers to start talking back about art ; the museums are all ears .

Unlike old-fashioned outings , these audio excursions are meant for an individual listener rather than a group , and because they offer the option to pause , skip or replay , every word can be savored . TOURCASTER.COM features more than 110 guides to thirty cities , and the best of them are concise and com-prehensive , with local experts providing flavor and intriguing facts while they lead the listener through the Vatican , on the " Composers Tour " of Vienna or on the " Rock &; Walk " in Los Angeles . For eloquent literary itineraries , the news-anchor voices behind ITOORS.COM follow the footsteps of Hemingway in Paris , controversial London scribes ( think Orwell and Marx rather than Dickens and Shakespeare ) and more . JANESSMARTART.COM offers unusual depth  --  if not breadth  --  of content as its narrator and founder , Jane McIntosh , illuminates the art and architecture of Rome 's St. Peter 's Basilica , Antwerp 's Our Lady Cathedral and other cultural spots .

STEPHEN DUDLEY HEARD ANY GOOD BOOKS LATELY ? As more and more people discover the advantages of listening to literature on their iPods  --  and even their compatible Palm Pilots and mobile phones  --  the brave new digital world is not so quietly transforming the once-sedate milieu of audiobooks . Leading this shift is the ten-year-old Web site AUDIBLE.COM , which provides choice recorded material for fast and easy downloading . The company offers a staggering 130,000 hours of fiction , nonfiction , drama , poetry and educational content  --  the same recordings you 'd find on CD or tape , plus additional ones created for or by Audible .

And membership plans ( $14.95 to $22.95 per month ) offer even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site 's condensed audio versions of more than forty-five periodicals ( the Wall Street Journal , the London Times and Forbes among them )  --  monthly , weekly and even daily content that simply would n't be feasible to buy on tape or on disk .
