A healthy immune system is the body 's best ally  --  an automated engine of biological warfare that can destroy almost any microbial parasite it encounters . But , like all other agents of destruction , when it spirals out of control , it is as deadly to friend as it is to foe . <P> Fifteen million Americans know this in their bones . They are victims of a group of more than 40 disorders that arise when the immune system launches a sustained attack against the body . Ailments as diverse as psoriasis , multiple sclerosis and Type I diabetes are all caused by an immune system run amuck . No one knows what initiates any of these chronic diseases or how they might be cured , but researchers have lately made significant headway in developing drugs to treat them  --  drugs that arguably represent the first substantial advancement in the field in 50 years . <P> Most of these drugs are genetically engineered biological molecules , and the majority are designed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and its close clinical relative , lupus . Like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In RA , the immune system attacks the joints and eventually weakens the bones , causing excruciating pain , fatigue and daily bouts of fever . With lupus , the attack is far more generalized , affecting blood vessels , joints , skin and several internal organs . In severe cases , it can be lethal . <P> Both can be treated , but there is a catch : the treatments are nearly as harsh as the diseases . Steroids , for example  --  a mainstay of lupus therapy  --  shut down the immune system and suppress inflammation , but they can also promote hardening of the arteries , bone loss , obesity and even psychosis . Steroids are , in fact , among the leading causes of death and morbidity for patients with chronic lupus . <P> But things are looking up , thanks to advances in immunology that have spurred the creation of a new generation of drugs . It is becoming clear that a cell called CD4 , or helper T cell , is a key player in both healthy and autoimmune responses . " T-cell activation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of checks and balances , " explains Dr. C. Garrison Fathman , a clinical immunologist at Stanford University . <P> One of those checks is the T cell 's dependence on another cellular player : the antigen-presenting cell . The APC is an omnivorous creature whose job , among other things , is to gobble up microbial invaders . To initiate the immune response , the APC coughs up a molecule from the bug it has eaten , latches on to a helper T cell and " presents " it with a target molecule , instructing the T cell to prepare its troops for war . This activation is tightly controlled ; it can not occur without the lockstep interaction of several proteins on both cells  --  one of which is known as CD4 . <P> Once activated , the T cell becomes a sort of commander in chief of immunity , activating the B cell  --  which secretes antibodies  --  and prompting the release of a farrago of inflammatory molecular signals . <P> Autoimmune responses follow a similar course , but the cells targeted belong to the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , tamp down that response by blocking communication between the immune system 's soldiers .
