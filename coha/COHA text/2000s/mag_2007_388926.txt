Headnote ( ECCENTRIC 'S CORNER ) HE 'S A GEEK AND A POSTMODERN DIGITAL PIONEER . AND HE ROCKS . BY MATTHEW HUTSON WHEN JONATHAN COULTON quit his job as a computer programmer and started posting quirky compositions on jonathancoulton.com , he did n't just gain a cult following in the hundreds of thousands-he sparked a cottage industry . Fans regularly send him remixes of his songs ( which cover everything from Tom Cruise to Ikea to zombies ) , videos , and cartoon versions of his characters . One ardent admirer even created a coloring book based on Coulton 's oeuvre . He hit his stride in 2005 , when he embarked on " Thing a Week " : Over the next year he wrote , recorded , and released 52 songs , all from his home in Brooklyn . Whether they 're about being excited for an upcoming pizza party or the despair of a madman who 's fallen for a woman , Coulton 's songs hit home with musical sophistication and heartfelt sincerity . Q : Why did you quit your job ? A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , not using the talents that I wanted to use . My daughter was born , and it suddenly seemed incredibly dishonest . I wanted to set a good example for her and it became much more important to be true to myself . And I wanted to spend more time at home . Q : Describe your " forced march " approach to creativity . A : The idea was to keep myself busy and pretend that it was my job to write songs , and also I thought a song-a-week had a stunt appeal that would attract a little attention . At first it was really fun and exciting and easy , but after about four songs I sort of ran out of ideas . There were weeks when I was forced to finish an idea I really hated , and a lot of the time those songs ended up being my favorites . That was rewarding . Q : Have your fans ' reactions changed how you work ? A : It has n't changed my output but it 's changed the final product . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius who imprisons a beautiful woman who wanders into his lair . He 's in love with her but he ca n't express himself very well because he 's a monster . That 's really struck a chord with a lot of people-many have made videos and drawn pictures . I really like the idea that when I write and record a song , it 's not finished . It still has room to grow and be interpreted in different ways and become something larger than what I intended it to be . Q : You performed a concert in an online game , Second Life , using a body double . What 's it like having a virtual likeness ? A : It 's great The avatar is much fitter and better looking than I am . It 's kind of a sexy-looking avatar if I do say so myself . I do n't spend much time in Second Life but I 've visited some of the casinos and S &M; stores and rented airplanes there . Q : You are a " contributing troubadour " at Popular Science magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A : You know what would be really fun ? To be a troubadour for the local news in some small town . Every day I would write a little song about some human-interest story . Q : Your songs are zany but touching . A : I 'm always trying to treat funny situations very seriously . So when I wrote " Skullcrusher Mountain , " I intended for it to be a funny song , but I also tried to feel sympathy for this monstrous character . So the headline is " Evil Geniuses Need Love Too . " And while that may be a funny bumper sticker , it 's also a sad fact Q : Do you see yourself as a tragicomic hero in life ? A : I think I must . I do find myself cracking jokes in my head about even the worst situations . Maybe that 's a coping mechanism . Q : Your song about your daughter the chorus goes , " you ruined everything/in the nicest way " is n't jokey . A : When you have a baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to spend time mourning the end of your old life . Of course that feeling does n't last for long . I hate that it 's such a clich , but it 's hard to avoid saying it : Having kids is truly a wonderful experience . And one of the greatest things about it is that it forces you to change in a thousand tiny ways that make your life better . It can feel quite catastrophic in the beginning , but I guess sometimes growth feels that way . Q : How would your wife describe your personality ? A : She would probably say that I 'm a type-A personality masquerading as a type-B . I play the role of a laid-back guy who does n't worry about stuff , but I 'm secretly freaking out about things . I 'm not sure whether my fascination with monkeys and robots would come up ; I generally keep that stuff in the studio .
