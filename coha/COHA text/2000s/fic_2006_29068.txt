bird Bird clattered down the stairs in back of Mama , past Mrs. Daley 's on the first floor , and Sullivan the baker at the window in front . Outside she and Mama held hands , swinging them back and forth as they hurried along Water Street . " Hot . " Bird squinted up at the sun that beat down , huge and orange . " Even this early , " Mama agreed . For a quick moment , they stopped to look at the tower standing by itself at the edge of the East River . One day it would be part of a great bridge . What would it be like to stand on top , arms out , seeing the world the way a bird would ? she wondered . Bird , her nickname . She pulled her heavy hair off her neck . " Mrs. Daley says they 'll never be able to finish that bridge . She says it will collapse under its own weight and tumble right into the river . " They said it together , laughing : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , " Bird said , " half of Brooklyn says the same thing . " " Not I , " Mama said , " and not your da . We know anything is possible , otherwise we 'd still be in the Old Country scrabbling for a bit of food . " Bird glanced at Mama , the freckles on her nose , her hair with a few strands of gray coming out of her bun ten minutes after she 'd looped itup : Mama 's strong face , which Da always said was just like Bird 's . She could n't see that . When she looked in the mirror , she saw the freckles , the gray eyes , and the straight nose , but altogether it did n't add up to Mama 's face . She was glad to reach the house on the corner , the number 112 painted over the door , and the vestibule out of the sun . They climbed the stairs , the light dim as they stopped to catch their breath on each landing . " Let me . " Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulder . " It seems your patients are always on the top floor . " " Ah , is n't it so , " Mama said , holding her side . " And the babies always coming in the dead cold of winter , or on steamy days like this . " Bird could feel the tick of excitement . Mama 's words to her were deep inside her head : " Only days until your thirteenth birthday . You 're old enough to come with me for a birthing . " Bird 's feet tapped it out on the steps : a baby , a baby . She 'd been helping Mama for a long time , chopping her healing herbs and drying them , helping to wash old Mrs. Cunningham , bringing tonic to Mr. Harris . But this ! A baby coming ! She could n't have been more excited . On the fifth floor , the door was half-open . Two children played under a window ; an old man rocked in the one chair , a toddler on his lap pulling at his beard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the bedroom , the daughter lay in a nest of blankets , her head turned away , her hair in long dark strands over the covers . She made a deep sound in her throat , then turned toward them , and Bird could see how glad she was that Mama was there . Who would n't be glad to see Mama , who knew all about healing , about birthing ? Mama , who always made things turn out right . Mama patted the woman 's arm . " I know , Mrs. Taylor . " She nodded at Bird . " Now here 's what you 'll do . You 'll sit on the other side of the bed there . Hold her hand , and cool her forehead with a damp cloth . " Easy enough , Bird thought . " And I 'll have the work of it , " the woman said before another pain caught her , blanching the color from her cheeks . " You 've done it all before . " Mama leaned over to open her bag . " After three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now ? " Mama made a tent of the blankets so she could help with the birth , and Bird went into the other room to fill a pan with water and wring out a rag . She stepped over the children as she went , bending down to touch the tops of their heads . Back in the bedroom she ran the rag over the woman 's neck and face . She held her hand during the pains for as long as she could stand it , then pulled her own hand away in between each one . Bird 's hands were larger than Mama 's already , but still she felt as if her fingers were being crushed in the woman 's grip . At first the woman talked a little , telling them that her husband wanted a boy , that he would n't forgive her if it was another girl , but after a while it was only her breathing Bird heard in that stifling room , and sometimes that sound in her throat , but Mama 's voice was sure and soft , telling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the miracle of it , to be like Mama , to be able to do this . She wanted nothing more than that , to go up and down the streets of Brooklyn , with all that Mama knew in her head , the herbs to cure in a bag looped over her arm , the babies to birth . Bird watched Mama wipe her own forehead with her sleeve , then put her hands on the woman , pressing down and murmuring , " Take another breath , and as you let it out , push with me , push . " It went on and on , and the room was filled with that July heat , with air that never moved . Such a long day , and the sounds the woman made were much louder now , so loud that the two children came to the door , staring in , until Mama realized they were there . She reached with her foot to push the door and gently closed them out . And then the smell of blood was in the room , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A girl . " She handed her to Bird . Too bad about the foolish husband , Bird thought , looking down at the baby , who was pale , and tiny , and crying weakly . " Beautiful , " she breathed , then washed her with water from the pan and wrapped her in the receiving blanket Mama took from her bag . Bird could feel the wetness in her eyes from the won- der of it , and the woman sighed and asked , " What 's your name ? " " Bridget Mallon . " The name sounded strange ; no one called her anything but Bird . " Bridget , " the woman said . " Then that will be her middle name . Mary Bridget . " From the Hardcover edition .
