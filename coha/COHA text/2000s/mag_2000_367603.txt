Mammograms have saved the lives of tens of thousands of women over the past 20 years . Though mammograms are not perfect , their ability to detect small tumors gives doctors and their patients the option of treating the cancer while it is in an early , more curable stage . And yet by the time even a small tumor is picked up on a mammogram , odds are it has been growing for five to seven years . What if doctors could find even younger ( and therefore presumably easier to treat ) breast tumors ? That 's the question that a group of researchers asked themselves at a conference sponsored by the Department of Defense that ended in Atlanta last week . Their cautious conclusion : with a little help from the biotech industry , they may have found some good strategies for uncovering the tiniest of tumors . <P> BLOOD TESTS Researchers from the John Wayne Cancer Center in Santa Monica , Calif. , are working on developing biological markers that could identify microscopic tumors as they travel through the blood . As many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as far as anyone can tell , spread to the lymph nodes have a recurrence of the malignancy after their treatment . Current thinking is that they must already have had so-called micrometastases in their bloodstream and that a blood test might eventually uncover the problem ahead of time . Depending on the result , doctors could then pursue more aggressive treatment . <P> A " PAP SMEAR " FOR THE BREAST Since most breast tumors seem to originate in the milk ducts , why not just remove fluid from the ducts and check the cells for signs of abnormal growth ? ( That 's basically the strategy doctors and other health-care providers use during a Pap smear to check the cervix for signs of abnormal growth before the cells become dangerous . ) If there is a problem , so the theory goes , it could be traced to a particular duct , which would then be carefully monitored for signs of malignancy . One major drawback : seemingly abnormal results can be triggered by changes in the breast during pregnancy , breast feeding , certain stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCANS Researchers at the University of Chicago and elsewhere are developing computer programs that can point out questionable areas on mammograms that might easily be missed . Other scientists are looking at the possibility that a different type of scan , magnetic resonance imaging , can help spot tumors in areas of the breast that are difficult for a mammogram to penetrate . <P> This research is so preliminary that no one knows yet which strategies will pan out or even if it 's a good idea to look for microcancers . After all , it 's quite possible that the body successfully destroys small clumps of tumor cells all the time . Being able to identify them could therefore subject women to needless worry and possibly unnecessary treatment . In addition , it 's not always easy to draw the line between normal tissue that happens to be growing a little funny and cells that are destined to become lethal . <P> For now , at least , mammograms ( combined with self-exams ) are the best bet for early detection . If you 're a healthy woman , 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and check your breasts every month . But also keep an eye out for research news that could change the nature of your next breast exam .
