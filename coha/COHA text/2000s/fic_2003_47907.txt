" YOU 'LL GET ARTHRITIC eyes , " Susan declared , " if you keep watching that thing . Turn it off and listen a minute . " <p> Ettie pressed MUTE . <p> " Off ! " <p> Obediently , Ettie pressed the red button . The screen went dark . <p> " You know what Kate told us . There 's a lake here - a beautiful lake that is n't on anybody 's map . " <p> " I did the Internet search , Mom . Remember ? " <p> " And you sit watching an old TV with rabbit ears in a rented cabin . " Susan was not to be distracted . " You know what your father says - people who get eyeball arthritis see only what they 're supposed to see , like that TV screen . Their eyes stiffen <p> Ettie brought out the artillery . " If Dad 's so smart and such a good father , why did you divorce him ? " <p> " I did n't say he was a good husband . Come on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a haunted lake ? " <p> Thinking it over , Ettie decided she did not . For one thing , she did not care for ghosts . For another , she was pretty sure this was a dream , and it might easily turn into a bad one . A haunted lake would give it entirely too much help . Aloud she said , " You 're going to write a magazine article and get paid . What 's in it for me ? " <p> " I 'll take pictures , too , " Susan declared . " Lots of pictures . It 's supposed to be very scenic . If a ghost shows up in one of my pictures , the sale will be a .... " <p> " Snap , " Ettie supplied . <p> " Foregone conclusion . " <p> The car door slammed , and the car pulled smoothly away from the one-room log cabin that had been their temporary home . Ettie wondered whether she had left the TV on and decided she had . Would Nancy Drew have remembered to turn it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " Susan continued . Studying Ettie from the corner of her eye , she concluded that more selling was in order . " They tortured their white prisoners , gouging out their eyes and scalping them while they were still alive . Is n't that exciting ? " <p> " Native Americans never did anything like that . " Ettie sounded positive , even to herself . <p> " Oh yes , they did ! A hunter found the lake hundreds of years afterward , and took his family there for a picnic because it was so pretty . His little daughter wandered away and was never seen again . " <p> " I knew I was n't going to like this . " <p> " Her spirit haunts it , walking over the water and moaning , " Susan declared with relish . <p> " You ca n't possibly know that . " <p> " It 's what everybody says , Kate says . So today we 'll find it - you and me , Ettie - and we 'll stay out there all night and take lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a sudden chill descended at midnight , a chill our struggling little fire could not dispel , seeming to rise from the very waters that - " <p> " Mother ! " <p> " Harbor the ghosts of hundreds of Mohicans massacred by the Iroquois and thousands - no , innumerable - Iroquois massacred by white settlers , waters said to harbor pike of enormous size , fattened for centuries upon - ah ! There 's the farmhouse . " <p> It looked horrible , Ettie decided . " Burning that down would be an improvement . " <p> " They 're old and poor . It 's not polite to make fun of old people . Or poverty . " A wrench at the wheel sent the car gliding into a farmyard from which no chicken fled in terror . <p> " They 're dead , if you ask me . " Ettie pointed toward the little cemetery that should have been the front yard . Its cast-iron fence was rusting to pieces , and its thin limestone monuments leaned crazily . <p> Susan took her key from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of old farms have them . " <p> " Right in front of the house ? " <p> " I think that 's touching . They cared about their dead . " They were climbing broken steps to a ramshackle porch innocent of paint . " Probably they sat out here on rockers and talked to them . " <p> " Cozy . " <p> " It is , really . The dead are nearer the living than you know , Ettie . " <p> You 're dead yourself , Ettie thought rebelliously , and ohmyGod how I miss you . <p> Susan knocked . The knocks echoed inside the old farmhouse . There was no other sound . <p> " Let 's go , " Ettie suggested . <p> " I 'm right here , dear . " <p> " I know you are , " Ettie said . " I 'm scared anyway . Let 's go . Please ? " <p> " Kate says there 's an old man here who knows precisely where Hunter 's Lake is . I 'm going to question him and tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , and take pictures of this house . " <p> Somebody behind them said , " No , you 're not . " <p> Ettie found that she had turned to look , although she had not wanted to . The woman behind them was old and bent , and looked blind . <p> Susan smiled , laid a hand on Ettie 's shoulder and tried to grasp that shoulder in a way that would make it clear to Ettie that she , Susan , was counting on her not to misbehave . " Mrs. Betterly ? " <p> " Ai n't no business of yours , young woman . " <p> " My name 's Susan Price , " Susan continued bravely , " and my daughter and I are friends - good friends - of Kate Eckert 's . We 're looking for Hunter 's Lake - " <p> The old woman moaned . <p> " And Kate said your husband would help us . " <p> " He wo n't talk to no women , " the old woman declared . " He hates women . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a woman , he tolt me once . " <p> Susan looked thoughtful . " My daughter is n't a woman yet . " <p> " Mother ! " <p> " Really now , Ettie . What would Nancy Drew say ? " <p> " I 'm getting out of here , ' if she had any sense . " <p> " He wo n't hurt you . How old is he , Mrs. Betterly ? " <p> " Eighty-seven . " The old woman sounded proud . " He 's ten year old'n me , and wo n't never die . Too mean . " <p> Susan gave Ettie her very best smile . " You see ? What are you afraid of ? That he 'll hit you with his walker ? He might call you a name , at worst . " <p> " Or shoot me . " <p> " Nonsense . If he shot little girls for asking polite questions , he 'd have been sent to prison long ago . " Susan turned to the old woman . " All right if Ettie tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman said . After a moment she added grudgingly , " That 's a brave little gal . " <p> As though by magic , Ettie found that her hand was on the doorknob . <p> " He 'll be in the parlor listenin ' to us . Or if he ai n't , in the sittin ' room . If he ai n't in the sittin ' room , he 'll be in the kitchen for sure . " <p> The hinges are going to squeak , Ettie told herself . I just know it . <p> They did , and the floorboards creaked horribly under her feet . She closed the door so that her mother would not see her fear and pressed her back against it . <p> Outside , Susan endeavored to peep through several windows , returned to her car , and got her camera . " All right for me to take your picture , Mrs. Betterly ? " <p> " Just fog your film , " the old woman said . " Always do . " <p> " Then you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in a lot of the house . <p> In it ( it appeared immediately on the back of her camera ) the old woman was holding a bouquet of lilies . " Where did you get the flowers ? " Susan asked . <p> " Picked ' em , " the old woman explained . " Grow wild ' round here . Buttercups , mostly . " <p> " Where did they go ? " Susan tried to hide her bewilderment . <p> " Thew ' em away once your picture was took . " <p> Inside , Ettie was poking around the parlor , pausing every few seconds to look behind her . The carpet , she noticed , was too small for the room , torn and moth-eaten . Dust covered the bare floor , and there were no footprints in the dust save her own . <p> He is n't here , she thought . He has n't been here for a long , long time . <p> And then : I could take something . A souvenir . Anything . None of this stuff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There was a glass-topped case at the end of one of the divans . It held old coins and arrowheads , and the top was not locked . She selected a worn little coin with a crude picture of a Native American on it to remember this day and how frightened she had been . <p> There was no one in the sitting room and no one in the kitchen . No one in the dining room , either . <p> A crude stair took her upstairs as effortlessly as an escalator . He 's old , she thought , I 'll bet he 's sick in bed . <p> There were three very old-fashioned bedrooms , each with its own small fireplace . All were empty . <p> He 's gone , Ettie told herself happily . He 's been gone for years and years . I can tell Mother anything . <p> Outside again , speaking to Susan from the porch , she said , " Do you want everything , or just the important parts ? " <p> " Just the important parts . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went away . " For an instant , Susan forgot to look perky , " I turned around , and she was n't there . Did her husband call you names ? " <p> That was easy . Ettie shrugged . " You said you just wanted the important stuff . Here it is . He said for us to go home . " <p> Susan sighed . " That 's not what I sent you in to find out . " <p> " Well , that was the important thing . " Ettie did her best to sound reasonable . <p> " All right , everything . But leave out the names . " <p> " Okay . He said , ' Little lady , that lake 's a real bad place , so do n't you ever forget you 're a grown woman and got a Ph.D . and a daughter of your own . ' Am I supposed to do the dialect ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Fine . He also said , ' If you got to go there , you time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You go home . One way or the other . That 's all I 'm going to tell you . Get on home . ' " <p> Curious , Susan asked , " Did he really call you little lady ? " <p> " Heck no . You said to leave out the names so I did . " <p> Susan sighed . " I suppose it 's better that way . How did he say to get to the lake ? " <p> " He did n't . " Ettie shrugged . " Want me to go in and ask him again ? " <p> " Will you ? " <p> " Not unless you tell me to . " <p> " All right . Ettie , you get yourself back in there and tell him we must find Hunter Lake . Do n't take no for an answer . You have to be firm with men , and you might as well learn now . " <p> Nodding , Ettie went back inside . It would be smart , she told herself , to spend quite a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelf in the parlor and opened it . The Alhambia , by Washington Irving . It looked as though it had never been read . <p> After a minute or two , she realized that her mother was trying to peer through the very dirty window pane and the filthy curtains , and went into the sitting room . There was a nice old rocker in there . She sat in it and rocked a while , reading Washington Irving . <p> Outside again , blinking in the sunlight , she realized that she had never really decided what to say when she came out . To buy time , she cleared her throat . " You really want to hear this ? " <p> " Yes . Of course . " <p> " Okay , first he asked me all about you . That was after I had said you kept sending me back in . He said you sounded like a real bitch , and if you came in he 'd get the chamber pot and throw shit at you . " <p> " Ettie ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that he explained to me about Hunter Lake . He said did n't I know why they called it that ? I said because a hunter found it . He said that was wrong . He said it was ' cause it hunted people . He said it could move all around just like bear and climb trees - " <p> Susan stamped her foot . " We want directions . " <p> " What do you mean , ' we ' ? " <p> " Did he give you any directions ? Any directions at all ? " <p> " Just go home . I told you that the first time . " <p> " We need directions , not stories . Go back in there and tell him so . " <p> Ettie walked through the empty house , slowly , stopping to stare at things and open drawers , until she felt that something was following her . When she did , she hurried back outside , slamming the door and running down off the porch . " I 'm not going back in there ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I wo n't ! " <p> Susan studied her , her lips pursed . " That bad , huh ? " <p> " Yes ! " <p> " Did he give you directions ? " <p> Mutely , Ettie went to the car and got in . Two minutes passed before Susan slipped into the driver 's seat next to her . " Ettie ? " <p> Ettie said nothing , and Susan started the engine . <p> " Get out of here , " Ettie told her . " Pull out onto the road again . Turn left . " <p> " That 's away from the cabin . I thought you wanted to go home . " <p> " Home-home , " Ettie said . " Not away-home . Turn left . " <p> " Our bags are back at the cabin . " <p> " Left . " <p> Susan turned left . <p> " Go down this road , " Ettie said , " till you see a road off to the right through the corn field . There 's no sign and it 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at her , Susan slowed instead . Twenty miles an hour . Fifteen . Ten . " <p> Slower , " Ettie told her . " Follow it to the woods . Stop the car and get out . Look for the path . Follow the path to the house . An Injun named George Jones lives in the house . He knows . Give him ten dollars . " <p> " You said ' Injun , ' " Susan muttered . " You never even say Indian . " <p> Ettie said nothing . <p> Half a mile later , Susan saw the road , braked too late , backed up , and turned down it - a red dirt road barely wide enough for a farm truck , two ruts flanking a strip of grass and weeds . <p> When the road would take them no farther , she and Ettie got out . <p> " Please do n't lock the car , " Ettie said . " I 've got a feeling we might want to get in and get away quick . " <p> Susan stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . I 'm going down it . You can wait in the car if you want to , but it may be quite a while . " <p> " You wo n't leave the keys ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Two will be safer than one , " Ettie said . <p> The house was a shack , perhaps ten feet by fifteen . An Indian woman was tending a tiny plot of vegetables . Susan said , " We 're looking for George Jones , " and the Indian woman straightened up and stared at her . <p> " We need his help . We 'll pay him for it . " <p> The Indian woman did not speak , and Ettie wanted to cheer . <p> Susan opened her purse and took a ten dollar bill from her wallet . She showed it to the Indian woman . " Here it is . Ten dollars . That 's what we 'll pay him to guide us to Hunter Lake . " <p> Something that was no expression Susan had ever seen before flickered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He fish , " she said . <p> " In Hunter Lake ? " <p> Slowly , the Indian woman nodded . <p> Susan breathed a sigh and gave Ettie one triumphant glance . " Then take us to him , or tell us how to find him . " <p> The Indian woman held out her hand , and Susan dropped the ten into it . The Indian woman clutched it , wadding it into a tiny ball . <p> " How do we get there ? " <p> The Indian woman pointed . The path was so narrow as to be almost invisible even when they were on it . A game trail , Susan decided . " Deer made this , " she told Ettie . <p> If Ettie spoke , twenty or thirty feet behind her , she could not be heard . <p> " They need water , " Susan explained , " just like us . They must go to Hunter Lake to drink . " Privately , she wondered how far it was , and whether her feet would hold up . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a couple of blocks . Ettie , in jeans , T-shirt , and loafers , was probably worse off still . But younger , Susan told herself . Ettie 's a lot younger , and that counts for a lot . " Ettie ? " She had stopped and turned . <p> " Yes , Mother ? " <p> " Am I going too fast for you ? I can slow down . " <p> " A little bit . " <p> Susan waited for her to catch up . " What are you thinking about ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> Susan bent and kissed her . " Really , dear . I love you . You know that . I 'll always love you . " <p> Ettie shook her head . " That 's not how it will be . Not really . I 'll always love you , Mom . " <p> Susan kissed her again . " Now tell me what 's troubling you . " <p> " I was wondering if I 'd turned off the TV before we left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . <p> " Is that all ? " <p> " Why I 'd told you that stuff . About the Native American . All this . I could have just said he would n't tell , only I did n't . " <p> " Because you 're an honest , decent person , Ettie . " <p> Ettie shook her head . " Because he made me . I do n't know how he did it , but he did . " <p> " Well , come on . " Susan turned and began to walk again . " It 's probably right over the next hill . " <p> " It 's a long , long way , " Ettie said despondently . " Besides , this path does n't even go there . We 'll walk until we 're too tired to walk any more , and be lost in the woods . Nobody will ever find us . " <p> In point of fact , Susan was right . The path skirted the crest of the hill and descended sharply through close-packed hardwoods . For almost twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan holding up branches for Ettie , who hurried under them , waving away mosquitoes . <p> As abruptly as the explosion of a firework , they emerged into sunlight . Water gleamed at the bottom of a steep hillside thick with ferns . On the other side of the gleam , water like molten silver cascaded down the face of a miniature cliff . <p> Susan raised her camera . A hundred yards or so down to the water - from here , she could only suggest that by showing a few fern fronds at the bottom of the picture . Then the water , then the cliff with its waterfall , then white clouds in the blue sky , and thank God for sky filters . <p> She snapped the picture and moved to her left . <p> " Are we really going to stay here ? " Ettie asked . <p> " Only overnight , dear . We 'll have to carry some gear from the car - not the tent , just the sleeping bags and a little food . It wo n't be all that hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head , but Susan was looking through her viewfinder and did not see her . It was n't really a hundred yards , she decided . More like fifty . She snapped the picture , and decided the next should be taken at the water 's edge . <p> " Mom .... " <p> She stopped and turned . " Yes , Ettie ? What is it ? " <p> " I wish you would n't go down there . " <p> " Afraid I 'll fall in ? I wo n't , and I doubt that it 's very deep close to shore . " Susan turned and began walking downhill again . She was a little tired , she decided ; even so , walking down a gentle slope over fern was remarkably easy . <p> " Mom ! " <p> She stopped again . <p> " Where 's the Native American man , Mom ? Where 's George Jones ? He was supposed to be down here fishing . I can see the whole lake . There 's nobody here but us . " <p> Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming up ! Get back ! " <p> It was , or at least it seemed to be . Surely the lake had not been that large . <p> " It 's a natural phenomenon of some kind , " Susan told Ettie , " like the tide . I 'm sure it 's harmless . " <p> Ettie had released her arm . Ettie was running up the slope like the wind . A loafer flew off one foot as Susan watched , but Ettie never paused . She walked up the slope to the spot , found the loafer , and looked back at the water . <p> In a moment more it would be lapping her feet . She turned and ran , pausing for a moment at the highest point of the path to watch the water and take another picture . That was probably a mistake , as she realized soon after . The water had circled the hill , not climbed it . She ran then , desperately , not jogging but running for all that she was worth , mouth wide and eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off and dropped it . The Indian shack was nowhere in sight ; neither was her car . Woods gave way to corn , and corn to woods again , and the water was still behind her . When the land over which she staggered and stumbled rose , she gained on the water , when it declined , the water gained on her with terrifying rapidity . <p> Ettie had turned back to look for her , limping on tender feet . She met the water before she had gone far , and thereafter ran as desperately , leaving a trail of blood the water soon washed away . Twice she fell , and once crashed straight though a tangle of briars whose thorns did nothing at all to hold back the water behind her . <p> " Here , Ettie ! Over here ! " <p> She looked to her left , and tried to shout Mom . There was precious little breath left for Mom . <p> " It 's our cabin ! Over here ! " <p> It was not . The cabin they had rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Get in ! " Susan was standing in the doorway . ( Behind Susan , Ettie glimpsed the flickering television screen . ) Ettie stumbled in , and fell . <p> Susan slammed the door and locked it . " It 'll try to get in under it , " she said , " but we 'll pack it with towels . Clothes . Anything . " She had thrown her suitcase on the bed . She opened it . <p> Ettie raised her head . " I 've got to wake up , Mom . " <p> " We 'll beat it ! " Briefly , Susan bent to kiss her . " We 've got to ! " <p> Then Ettie faded and was gone , and Susan was alone in the clapboard cabin . Water crept past the towels and her terrycloth robe to cover the cabin floor . When the water outside had risen higher than the windowsills , it crept under and around the sashes to dribble on the floor . <p> Henrietta woke sweating , terrified of something she could not name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ready , Mom . You want to have your Mother 's Day breakfast in bed ? " <p> " No , " Henrietta whispered . More loudly , " No . I do n't want to stay in here . I 'll be out in a minute , Honey . " <p> There were two robes in her closet , terrycloth and silk . Henrietta put the silk one on over her nightgown and tied its belt with a sudden violence she could not have explained . <p> The bed was a mess , sheet and blanket twisted and half on the floor . Pausing to straighten it up before she left the bedroom , her eyes caught the dull red of old copper . Once the worn little coin was in her hand , memories came flooding back . <p> Bacon and waffles , real butter and almost-real maple syrup in the sunshine-yellow breakfast nook , and Joan spraying Pam on the waffle iron . " Coffee 's on the stove , " Joan announced . <p> Henrietta sat , put the penny on her plate , and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last she picked it up and dropped it into a pocket of her robe . <p> " Do you know , " she told Joan , " I 've just recalled how your grandmother died , after being wrong about it all these years . She drowned . " <p> " Sure . " Joan held the steaming coffee pot . She filled Henrietta 's cup . " Fluid in her lungs . Uncle Ed told me . " <p> Sidebar
