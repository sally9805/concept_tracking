Lawrence Connolly has contributed several stories to our pages , including " Prime Time ! " and " Great Heart Rising . " He says recent stories of his are slated to appear in Cemetery Dance and in an anthology of humorous stories entitled Bash Down the Door and Slice Open the Bad Guy . ( With that title , let 's hope the stories are humorous ! ) On a more serious note , Mr. Connolly presented a paper entitled " Change Thy Shape : a Metamorphosis of Horror " at ICFA 27 and it has been published online in a new critical journal , Dissections ( available at http : // **36;3771;TOOLONG ) . Mr. Connolly 's first novel , Veins , is currently in the works , with publication tentatively slated for late 2007 or early 2008 . If these notes give the impression that Mr. Connolly knows his way around the world of horror fiction , then they 're accurate ... but that 's not all he knows . Witness this new work of science fiction- <p> SORRY TO BOTHER YOU , Sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , breaking her concentration as she finished calibrating the integration chamber . " We 've got a problem . " Cara turned , climbed from the chamber , and stepped out into the long shadows of cliff-side trees . The hatch closed behind her , hissing to an airtight seal . " Go ahead , Alpha . " An implant in Cara 's hyoid conveyed her voice to a transmitter in the back of her head . From there her words traveled straight up to the mission orbiter . " Break it to me gently . " Despite the 35,000 kilometers that separated orbiter and base , the answer when it came sounded as close as Cara 's own thoughts . " The surveillance flier 's gone down . " Cara winced as she turned toward a stand of trees that grew along the edge of her cliff-top base . " Tell me what happened . " She eased toward the precipice . Below the ridge , a forest canopy extended unbroken toward a plowed field . Beyond the field stood a wall of woven wood and pointed stakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furrows while villagers rested behind the wall . This was their communal hour , a time that Cara usually spent eavesdropping , watching the natives with the help of a tiny drone that could hover undetected above the settlement . But this evening the camp 's integrator had required attention , forcing Cara to leave Alpha in charge of monitoring the flier . " I ca n't figure it , " Alpha said . " It was functioning fine . Take a look . " A window appeared in Cara 's cyberoptic field , an ineye projection from corneal implants , powered by cybernetic neurons that ran from the back of her head to the interior of her eyes . The window displayed the drone 's last few seconds of visuals : an aerial view of villagers lounging between huts of woven reeds . Everything appeared normal . But then , abruptly , the image pitched : the village slid from view , replaced by a green blur that rose to fill the digital frame . After that , the window vanished . " So the drone went down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arc had carried it away from the village . " Yes , " Alpha said . " It 's in the forest . That 's the good news . " A new window opened , framing an orbital shot of the jungle canopy . Dimmed by distance and atmospheric distortion , the visual lacked the clarity of the flier 's image . " It went down here . " A circle appeared , highlighting the site . " Is the homing beacon operating ? " " Yes . For now . " Cara knew she had to retrieve the machine while the natives were at home . She turned , looking toward the integration chamber , newly calibrated and primed to receive the orbital beams that would transmute the packets of raw matter she had placed within the central kiln . Mission protocol required her to maintain the chamber in a state of readiness , thus allowing for short-notice transmissions of emergency equipment or , in the event that she became incapacitated , the teleportation of a new field observer . Alpha said . " If you leave now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky : deep blue at zenith , golden yellow beyond the village . " All right . I 'm going . " She walked through the clearing , continuing until she reached the geodesic tent that served as her home . From the front door , she saw the grave of her predecessor , the daughter of Prime who had piloted the lander on its one-way flight from the orbiter . " I 'd better make a statement . " " Go ahead . Recording . " Following procedure , Cara stated her designation and position : " Cara Gamma . Purgan Outpost . " She readied her excursion pack as she spoke , folding her portable rover , lashing it to her shoulder harness . " I 'm going to the forest to retrieve a downed flier . Projected off-base time : sixty minutes . " She donned the pack and tightened the straps . " Required safeguards are in place . Integrator is primed and calibrated . Alpha will transmit a replacement if I 'm out of contact for more than twelve hours . End statement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Send it . It 's fine . " " Sending now . " The statement was a formality , a document for clerics who would one day manage the estate of Prime . Cara did not wait for a reply . The Ministry was over thirty parsecs away . Even if all went well , she would be dead before her words crossed the galactic arm . CARA DESCENDED the cliff 's eastern face , keeping the crag between her and the village until she reached the forest floor . There , enveloped in long shadows and the drone of insects , she removed the rover from its harness and extended the control shaft . Nearby , a cloud of flies swarmed above the carcass of a large slug . The flies ignored her . They hunted by smell , and her scent lacked the chemical triggers that attracted them . Working in peace , she kicked down the rover 's pedals , locking them into place on either side of a single gyro-balanced wheel . Then she climbed on , leaned forward , and took off - stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rover cruised at forty klicks , its proprioception sensors maintaining stability as she leaned forward on the pedals . Gripping the control shaft , she bounded through the forest , over a carpet of brittle vegetation , and up onto the remnant of an ancient road that extended for nearly a kilometer before vanishing back into the forest loam . Surveys indicated that the road had once connected a string of settlements , all but one of which were now abandoned and overgrown . Together , the ruins presented a conundrum that she hoped to understand better before revealing herself to the island 's remaining inhabitants . The jungle thinned as Cara reached a swift-moving stream . Spreading branches rose above her , framing a patch of clear sky as she dismounted at the water 's edge . Then , with the rover once again folded against her back , she stepped across a makeshift bridge of stones and emerged onto the far bank . The flier was close , broadcasting its location from a tangled hollow . She hurried toward it , following the signal into the shadows of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what waited within . She wanted to run , but it was too late . A short figure stood before her , meeting her gaze with nictitating eyes . It was a villager . On his chest , swinging from a neckband of braided reeds , hung a twelve-centimeter disk of carbon fiber and molded plastic . She recognized the pendant . It was her fallen flier . For a moment , Cara and the creature stood eyeing each other through the shadows : the villager hunching his shoulders in a posture of respect , Cara leaning back , stunned by the realization that her days of detached observation were over . THIS TIME , it was Cara 's turn to voice the alarm . To Alpha , she said : " Sister , we 've got a problem . " The creature opened his jaws , silencing her with a loud click . Other sounds followed , shrill warbles from spiracle nostrils , clicks and chirps from a triangular mouth . There was nothing like it in human speech , except perhaps the self-harmonies of Tibetan throat singers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , after months of eavesdropping , Cara had become familiar with the sounds . Now , standing before the creature , she listened carefully , getting the gist of his words : " lam Long-Eyes , " he said . " You are a X-ooh . Sent by X-ah . " She knew the word X-ah , a throaty click followed by a low-vowel sigh , but its meaning could be tricky . Depending on inflection , it could mean either fate or spirit . The other word , X-ooh , was more mysterious . She had heard it before , spoken in reverent whispers . She had assumed it was a deity . Long-Eyes stared , waiting . Alpha said , " You need to answer him . " Cara hesitated . Alpha sent a prompt , keying it directly into Cara 's view . It was a simple greeting , augmented with symbols for alien phonemes : X for glottal click , N for nasalized whistle . " Talk to him , Sister ! " Cara gave it her best , wishing she had been endowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greetings , Long-Eyes . I am Cara . " Long-Eyes raised his hands , fingers clenched in amazement . " X-aha . " He pronounced the C as a click , giving the name an intonation similar to X-ah . Alpha said , " I think you just told him you 're a spirit . " But Long-Eyes seemed more delighted than afraid . He lowered his head , clicking : " You are X-aha , the X-ooh from X-ah ! " He bowed lower , removing the braided twine that held the flier to his chest . " Yours , " he said , handing her the broken drone . She took it , wondering at his bland acceptance of the tiny machine . He could not have seen it before it fell , and yet he handled it as if he had known about it for some time . " They fell , " he said , gesturing toward the drone . " I retrieved them . " " Them ? " She did n't understand . " You retrieved them ? " He spoke again , repeating himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered the pronoun singular . This time , she understood . He had said it , not them : " It fell . I retrieved it . For you . " All right . One question answered . But she was still confused . " How did you know* " She gestured , compensating for her uneven diction . " How did you know about me ? " " Know ? " He considered the question . " We have always known ... for long times ... ever since your sister came to the hills . " He turned , facing the cliffs that stood beyond the wall of trees . " She came at night , flying quiet and dark . But we knew . I knew . Long-Eyes saw . " Cara shivered . Quiet and dark was an apt description of the lander . It flew on ionic wind , without visible exhaust or guiding lights . Until now , she had never considered that the villagers might have seen it . Indeed , her months of eavesdropping had turned up no indication that the villagers knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently . " You knew7. " she asked . " You knew about my predecessor ! " " Yes . First about her . Then about you . When we heard the clear-sky thunder , we knew that you had come to take her place . " Teleportation was far from silent . The power beams that accompanied orbit-to-ground transmission gave off thunderous roars that , loud as they were , should not have attracted attention on an island of frequent storms . But evidently they had . Long-Eyes said , " X-ah brought you here to help us . It put you on the cliff , and now it has brought you to me . " " No . That 's not the way it is . I 'm - " He turned away as she struggled with the words . " We need to go now , " he said . " **35;3809;TOOLONG . But now that you are here - " He paused , cocking his head , listening to the forest . " We TTiust hurry before it comes . " " Before what comes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " X-eeNa . " Cara covered her mouth , subvocing to Alpha : " What 'd he say ? " " No idea . " " Check . " " Doing it now . " A pause , and then : " Not in our database . We 're hearing the word for the first time . " She played it back , letting Cara hear it again : X-eeNa . To Long-Eyes , Cara said , " / do n't know that word . " " Yes . I understand . The X-ooh T 'S as ignorant as it is powerful . " " Ignorant ! " He gestured toward her flier . " You studied our voices . You listened , but some things are best not spoken aloud . " " But you 're speaking them now . " " Yes . Because you are asking . " He turned , moving toward another remnant of forest road . She hurried after him . " I 'm not - " she struggled for the words . " I 'm not ... what you think . " He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She broke into a jog , keeping pace . " I 'm not a X-ooh , " she said . " Whatever a X-ooh is , I 'm not - " He stopped walking , gesturing for silence . In the distance , beyond the forest brume , something stirred-a sound like the thumping of massive feet . Softly , Long-Eyes muttered : " It 's coming . " " M " The sound changed course . She turned , following his gaze . To the south , beyond the point where distant trees merged to form a wall of trunks and shadows , the sound began moving away , heading toward the village . Long-Eyes gestured to her shoulder pack . " The running wheel , " he said . " You need to huiiy . " Cara reached around , unhitching the rover from its stays . " You want me to use this ? " " Yes ! " His nostrils flared . " Hurry ! " " Hurry wherel " " To the village . " She gripped the rover , swinging it by its handle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry me . " " Yes ! You go ! " She kicked the pedals into place . " Go to the field , " Long-Eyes said . " Use your power . KiWtAeX-eeNa ! " " Killitl " " We will help . We will distract it . We will make it an easy target for your power . Then you will kill it . " She turned from Long-Eyes , trying to remain calm as she called to Alpha . " What do I do ? " She spoke aloud , no longer subvocing . " Tell me what to do ! " Long-Eyes stared , apparently intrigued by the cadence of human speech . Alpha said , " Go to the field . " " And do what ? " " What you 're there for . Observe . Record what happens . " It was the advice of someone who had nothing to lose . If Cara were killed in action , the mission would continue with a fresh fieldworker , teleported from the orbiter 's files , integrated within the chamber that Cara had primed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the outpost , review the records , and continue the study . Long-Eyes said , " You need to hurry . Go to the field . Use your power . KitftheX-eeNa ! " Cara leaped onto the rover , leaned forward , and accelerated toward the village . SHE VEERED WEST , cutting a beeline toward the field , not decelerating until the trees thinned and the ground angled upward . Straight ahead , coalescing through the ferns and hanging fungi , the village stood backlit by evening sun . She changed course , turning left , steering beneath a cover of low-hanging branches .... The gyros cut out as she hopped from the pedals . She dropped to her knees , coming to rest behind a clump of ferns . Before her , the field stretched toward the village wall . Above the gate , lookouts peered between fire-hardened stakes , listening as the approaching thumps grew louder , coming closer .... A flock of leather-winged slugs leapt from the trees , soaring over the field on jets of vented air , scattering into the dusky sky as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two meters from the ground , gliding outward on the end of a powerful neck . Alpha said , " I 'm recording your visuals , but the Ministry 's still going to want your impressions . Better start talking . " Cara swallowed , watching the thing as it stepped onto the field , its profile so unnervingly alien that it seemed to shift before her - altering as her mind wrestled with the contours of its strangeness . " First impression ? " She glanced at the misshapen head , shielding her eyes as it passed before the sun . " It 's hideous ! " The creature turned , cutting the sunlight into flaring rays . " Its head is as big as I am . " It pivoted , surveying the field . " Its jaws are misaligned , with the mandible extending beyond the snout . " She squinted , trying to comprehend . " It 's got a face like a deep-sea predator ... a viperfish ... that 's the closest - " The beast roared , rearing its head , opening its jaws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jaw at all . Rather than swinging downward , it split vertically - cleaving at the chin , becoming a pair of muscular limbs , each anchored beneath the head and sporting fanglike claws . And now , with those limbs flexing wide , she saw the beast 's true mouth - an orifice near the top of the throat , chinless as the maw of a shark . She saw it for a second , and then the monster turned again , staring at the wall . It seemed to be waiting . Cara studied its profile . " I 'm trying to get a handle on the physiology , but I keep getting lost . It has avian hips , but it 's wingless - no forward appendages other than the ones that cover its mouth . The head is counterbalanced by a gigantic tail . It 's obviously warm-blooded , agile , swift . I 'm going to need months to review these visuals , Alpha . This thing 's like nothing I 've - " A tremor moved through the village wall . The animal leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back along wooden runners , cracking open to form a gap barely wide enough for a villager to squeeze through . " Something 's happening . " She saw movement within the gap . A shadow emerged , coalescing into a village child . Another followed . Then another . They walked with halting steps , heads bowed , shoulders hunched - goslings with pear-shaped bodies . Their arms , folded like wings , shivered beneath capes of woven reeds . Then the gate skidded back , closing tight while the procession hurried across the field . The animal watched , its tail twitching like a sputtering cable . Cara muttered , " I do n't believe what I 'm seeing . " The beast moved forward . " This looks like a sacrifice . " The children gathered in a tight huddle , heads together , shoulders locked . Cara stiffened . " I ca n't watch this . " Alpha said nothing . The scene 's horror had taken her voice . The beast crouched , folding its long legs , lowering the arch of its hips until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she could n't . It was her duty to watch , record , understand . And when it was over , when the beast had lopped the pear-shaped bodies into its crescent mouth and lumbered back into the forest , when all that remained of the children was an oval depression in the furrowed ground , then she finally mustered the strength to turn away . And when she did , she found that she was no longer alone amid the ferns . Long-Eyes stood behind her , panting from his race through the forest . " You did not kill it ! " He stood erect , shoulders stiff , hands clenched - an angry pose . " The beast stayed in place . We gave you an easy mark . But you did not kill it ! " Wailing voices rose from the village . The gate opened , scraping back once more . Cara tried watching to see if more villagers were coming out , but Long-Eyes stepped in front of her , standing close , blocking her view . " You did not use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You aie a X-ooh . " His faced darkened , turning sanguine near the spiracle ridge above his eyes . " The X-ah delivered you to help us . The Xah provided and you did not - " " No ! " she shouted back . " Not me . I'm- " She paused . How could she even begin to explain what she truly was ? Long-Eyes spared her the effort . " Your version of who you are does n't matter . For us you are a X-ooh . " He reached out , grasping her shoulders , his hands hot with anger . She pulled away . To Alpha , she muttered , " What do I do ? " " Return to base . " " But he 's asking for help . " " Not your job , Sister . Return to base . " Long-Eyes watched , cocking his head as Cara spoke to empty air . And then , feeling overwhelmed , Cara mounted her rover and whirred away , racing for the trees , not looking back , not even thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . For the moment , all that mattered was getting back to the illusion of objective study , away from the problem that was not hers . The camp was as Cara had left it , but the setting sun had deepened its contours , bathing everything with low-angled light . Her shadow followed her , extending from her heels like an elongated skid , moving beside her as she turned toward her predecessor 's grave - a cairn of rocks with a hand auger drill for a headstone . Her predecessor had used the drill to draw core samples from the forest floor . Now the tool tossed a cruciform silhouette across the grave . Cara looked left and doubleblinked , disengaging the streaming interface with the orbiter , opting for five minutes of privacy as she addressed the spirit of the woman within the cairn . " What should we do ? " she asked , sitting by the grave , leaning back to search her own thoughts for an answer . Her mind calmed . She closed her eyes , recalling the life of another Cara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a twentythree-year-old protg named Cara Randall .... As the inheritor of Randall 's memories , Cara Gamma carried impressions of places that she herself had never been : the Ministry 's cloistered lectoria , flight simulators , and exercise chambers . She recalled the joys of study , accessing the cybernetic wisdom of a hundred years of theoretical xenthropology . And when the call went out for volunteers to serve as fieldworkers on the Ministry 's growing catalogue of unexplored worlds , she took the vows and passed through the one-way doors that led to the chamber of scanning and deconstruction . She remembered the hiss of the closing seal and the dim pause that preceded the blinding light . Randall 's memories ended with that flash , but Cara Gamma did not need inherited recollections to know what happened next . The facts were all matters of procedure . The deconstructing flash transferred Randall 's essence to a pair of identical crystals - one went into the Ministry vaults , the other into the AI system of an unwomanned vessel bound for a point of perturbation in the orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall became Cara Prime , the template for a series of lone observers who would study a planet no human had ever seen . The first reintegration of Prime occurred when the vessel drew close enough to verify the planet 's existence . The shipboard computer activated the kiln , igniting the blocks of compacted matter that provided the substance for Cara Alpha - the first daughter of Prime . After climbing from the chamber , Alpha assumed the role of orbiting commander , and her first job , after checking herself for defects and wiggling into the piezoelectric unitard that powered her cybernetic system , was to verify the computer 's assessment of the planet . What she found was a world inhabited by a sentient species that had migrated from its point of origin to occupy a vast triangular continent . Along the opposing shores of an inland sea , two protocities had settled into a state of protracted aggression . Likewise , in the hinterlands , warring tribes slaughtered each other for possession of fertile deltas and valleys . These were not good places to initiate ground-based observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests of coastal islands . It was on one of these islands that she found a village of docile agrarians who had moved beyond the study of war . They lived inland , away from beaches that would have left them vulnerable to attacks from the sea . There , Alpha began the study . After selecting the site , Alpha recalibrated the shipboard integrator and primed the kiln . Then she closed the hatch , activated the system , and gave life to Cara Beta . It was Beta 's job to pilot the lander to the planet 's surface . Once there , she set up camp and began the first phase of ground observation . Two days passed without incident , and then , suddenly , Beta awoke to find herself facedown in the center of camp . She had blacked out . A day later , it happened again , only this time when she regained her senses she found herself lying dangerously close to the edge of the cliff . The next day , she blacked out twice in the morning , then once again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back , calling to her in tones that grew more anxious with each recurrence . Beta tried attributing the seizures to defects in her cybernetic interfaces , but when checks of those systems revealed nothing unusual , she and Alpha had no choice but to contemplate the grim alternative . The process of deconstruction and integration had a failure rate of point-four percent . Sometimes there were errors in the scans . Other times , data became corrupted during imprinting . Beyond that , with each repeated integration , there was a chance that fluctuations in power or disruptions of the data stream could result in a defective copy - a functioning integration that soon lost its physiological integrity . Not wanting to jeopardize the mission , Cara Beta instructed Alpha to send a replacement . Then , with her interfaces disengaged , Beta selfadministered a lethal injection of morphine sulfate , stretched back beneath the lander 's shadow , and entered a final blackout . Within the hour , Cara Gamma arrived to bury the remains . Cara leaned toward the grave , whispering to the stones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay still , cooling in the fading light . Cara stood , turning toward the village as she felt Alpha coming back on-line . She stared through the veil of camouflaged netting , into the distance to see what appeared to be a lone figure standing outside the village wall . " Alpha , you on-line ? " " Here , Sister . " " Give me your view of the village field . " Alpha complied , dropping an orbital shot into an ineye window . Cara closed her eyes . The image expanded , filling her head . There , amid blocky pixels and the wavy distortions of evening air , she saw a villager standing on the furrowed ground . She wondered if it was LongEyes waiting for her to return . " The villagers knew about us from the beginning , Sister . " " Yes , " Alpha said . " So Long-Eyes claims . " " He says I am a X-ooh , sent by X-ah . " " But you are Cara Gamma , the third integration of Cara Prime . The Ministry sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for certain . " " So it seems . " She turned , looking back at the lander , its sides open to reveal the outer hull of the integration chamber . " Long-Eyes said I have power . " " You do , although it is not the kind that kills monsters . " Atop the integration chamber , a heat exchanger sat like a steel lily , waiting to catch the next energy beam from the orbiting gun . " But what if it is ? " Cara said . " What if my power is that kind ? " She approached the chamber , climbing onto its hull to inspect the reflector the fist-sized cube that ensured a direct hit from the power beam . In some ways , the little single-use block of anodized metal was the integrator 's most vital component - so vital that each supply transmission included a set of spares .... It came to her then . She knew what she had to do . LONG-EYES stood alone in the field , staring at Cara as she emerged from the forest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was coming . " You aie a strange X-ooh , " he said . " No . Not a X-ooh . " She lifted a heavy strap from her shoulder , unslinging the improvised weapon that hung across her back . She held it so he could see it : a fearsome graft of steel and aluminum - shaped like a cross , wielded like a sword with a spiral blade . " / am not a X-ooh . But maybe I can help . " Long-Eyes studied the weapon . Cara said , " If that beast comes again - " " There is no question , " Long-Eyes said . " X-eeNa will come . " Cara swung the weapon , checking the bindings that held the spare reflector to the auger 's handle . Long-Eyes said , " You have brought your power this time . " " No . " She stopped swinging . " My power comes from the sky . " She spoke more fluently now , having taken time to practice the things she needed to say . " This is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking at himself in the reflector 's rightangled mirrors . She glanced toward the wall . The gate remained closed . Silence hung in the darkening air . She asked , " Why are you standing here ! " " Waiting , " he said . " Waiting for you or the X-eeNa. / am glad you came first . " He was standing on the spot where the children had offered themselves to the beast . Dried blood stained the dirt . " / offered to stand here , " he said . " It was the only thing to do . I had promised the children that you would not let them die . Their task was to distract the beast , to give you time to use your power . I promised them that they would not die if they did as they were told . " " You promised them2 . " " Yes . They were not supposed to die . That was your doing ... and my undoing . " He looked toward the forest . " Still , I am glad you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dilated ears . Something stirred within the trees . " It is coming , " Long-Eyes said , " It hears our voices . It will not pass up an easy meal . " The rumble came again , closer . Cara turned away , speaking to Alpha : " Stand by to power up . " " Standing by . " The gun took nearly two minutes to charge , and once armed it had to be fired quickly to avoid damaging the capacitors . Cara 's plan was simple . First , she had to plant the marker in the animal 's side . After that , she needed to keep the thing out in the open , in clear sight of the marking laser that aimed the gun , away from the village where a direct hit would risk collateral damage . As for herself , if she were unable to get clear of the blast , there was a good chance that Alpha would soon be sending a replacement to the cliff-top base . For that reason , Cara had used one of the spare reflectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed to the top of the camp 's integration chamber . One way or the other , whether she succeeded or failed , the study would continue . The thump of the creature 's long strides drew closer , the noise coming faster and louder as a cloud of slugs jetted from the trees . Then , seconds later , the X-eeNa emerged , spreading its mandible arms . Cara mounted the rover . " This is it , Sister . Power the gun ! " " It 's powering . " Cara turned to Long-Eyes. " / will do what I can . No promises . " He raised his hands , folding them in a show of thanks . She turned away , leaned forward , and took off across the field . " Gun is charging , Sister . Full power in one-one-eight seconds . " Cara continued straight until she was sure she had attracted the animal 's attention . Then she leaned left , veering parallel to the village wall . The animal followed , coming on fast , its long strides easily matching the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandible arms coming toward her , and leaned into a tight turn that carried her back through the veil of her own dust . The beast swung around , tracking her as she cut a tight arc around its legs . The ground shook as it turned in place . She moved with it , staying ahead of the arms only to find her course blocked by the whiplike tail . She veered again , ducked down , and hurtled between its legs . Alpha called to her as she emerged from beneath its hips : " Did you do it ? Did you plant the reflector ? " " No . " She steadied the auger against her shoulder . " I 'll get it this time . " She leaned again , giving the beast a wide berth as she swung around for another go . " Fifty seconds , Sister . " The animal lunged , reaching for her , forcing her into a one-eighty spin that sent her skidding back the way she had come . The claws closed behind her , shearing the empty air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the forest before looking back to find that the animal had given up the chase . She pulled on her control shaft , decelerating , spinning to a stop . She stared back at the creature 's mandible arms . Its crescent mouth quivered , pulsing in the shadow of its face . It leered . She returned the stare . " Thirty seconds , Sister . " What had she been thinking ? The plan was impossible . There was no way she was going to plant the marker , and now the clock was running out . " Sister ? You all right ? " She did n't bother to answer . There was nothing to say . She had failed again . But then , from across the field , the sound of clicking : Long-Eyes calling to the X-eea . The beast turned . Cara leveled her weapon . " All right . One more try . " She leaned forward , picking up speed . She wondered what Long-Eyes thought of her now - a one-wheeled knight with a corkscrew javelin . Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Surely , there was nothing like this in the village legends . " Twenty seconds , Sister ! Place that marker and get out of range ! " Cara focused on the target , staying the course , holding the shaft steady , watching the flexing mass of the animal 's right hip . She dodged the tail and raced toward the leg . And then , with a jolt that nearly threw her from the pedals , the auger struck its target , plunging deep , not stopping until the shaft hit bone and the beast roared like a klaxon . She spun , bounding away , losing control . Something clipped the rover , knocking the wheel from under her . She never saw what it was . It could have been the animal 's tail , or its leg , or even a ridge in the furrowed ground . Whatever it was , it sent her into a tumble - feet slipping across the sky , head plowing the dust ... ... and somewhere , a voice : " Ten seconds ! " Cara rolled , careering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's terrible head lunging for her . " Alpha ! Fire the gun ! " The mandible arms swung wide . Cara scrambled , crawling like a crab . " Do it now ! " The sky brightened , sparking with light from the orbiter . It was not the high-energy bolt - the one that would ignite the animal 's blood and send its pieces scattering over the field . This first light was only the marking laser , the low-energy beam to illuminate the reflector and guarantee a direct hit . The cool flash backlit the creature 's body . Cara braced herself . And then ... The night exploded . Her suit ignited , melting her piezoelectric unitard , searing her flesh as she flew into the air . Furrows raced beneath her , streaked with her leaping shadow - a cruciform silhouette that swelled as it rose to slam against her outthrust hands . Bam ! No pain . The agony would come later - after the shock had left her bones , after her flesh realized how badly it had been maimed . A woman screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant call that Cara could not answer . She could barely breathe , and it was all she could do to remain conscious as she pulled her face from the dust and looked back at the cleaved remains of the X-eea . The creature 's torso had exploded , leaving the head and tail convulsing on the ground . The eyes glared , staring at her , burning with numb rage as the mandible arms clawed the dirt . And still the distant voice shrilled inside her . " Respond , Sister ! Are you receiving ? " Cara coughed , finding her voice . " Receiving . " She looked down at her arms , the left one bare and bloody , her cybernetic unitard ruined . " I hear you , Alpha . " " Your bios are offline , visuals full of noise . " " But you hear me ? " " Yes . Hear you . What 's your condition ? " Cara tried lifting her arm . It responded . Still no pain . " Ca n't tell . I 'm alive . But everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried to rise . The world spun as the village gate slid open . Villagers hurried out . Not children this time , but tall males with heavy legs , kicking dusty clouds . " I 've got company . " She tried focusing on the running males . " Can you see them ? " " Orbital image only . You 're still not streaming . " Cara slumped to her knees . Long-Eyes caught her , grabbing her beneath the shoulders , helping her to her feet . She fell against him , smearing his tunic with blood as the males gathered around her , pressing close , their faces taut with admiration . She kept her eyes open , returning their stares , hoping her vision would go back online so Alpha could see what she was seeing . Long-Eyes said , " The Elders will want to meet you . They will want to hear what you have done . " He walked forward , guiding her toward the open gate . The crowd walked with them , and it was then that Cara glimpsed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , stumbling as she saw the X-eea rearing high into the night sky . Her breath caught , and then she saw the hands that held the monster 's neck and arms . The head swayed , dead eyes gleaming as the villagers carried their trophy through the gate and onto the narrow lanes that wound toward the dome in the center of the village . They took her to a hut beside the great wooden dome , and there they peeled away the remnants of her ruined suit , clicking and whistling at the maze of cybernetic conductors that lay between her skin and unitard . She was hurting now . Pain thundered as the villagers dressed her wounds . " Sister ! " She called to the orbiter as she lay on her back , staring at a ceiling of bent poles and cured bark . Smoke from a central fire gathered between the beams , swirling through an oval vent . " I 'm in the village , Sister . I wish you could see . I wish we were recording . " They brought her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink tingled , warming her throat and stomach as she forced it down . Almost instantly , her burns stopped hurting , and soon she found herself standing under her own power as artisans draped a woven tunic about her shoulders . She raised her good arm , marveling at how the cloth followed the contours of her frame . " They 're giving me clothes . The fit is almost perfect . And the top 's embroidered with - " She paused as she made sense of the pattern : dark threads depicting a warrior battling a beast with mandible arms . It was a stylized design , limited by the texture and color of the materials ; nevertheless , the stick-figure warrior seemed to stand upon a rounded foot a shape that resembled a rover 's wheel . She turned to Long-Eyes . " When ? . " She pressed a fist against the garment . " When ... you make this ? " His features tightened . " / did not make it . The cloth is old . " " How old ? " " X-eeo days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . It was not so much a number as a concept - an expression used when speaking of things too vast for counting , such as seeds in the field or trees in the forest . " X-eeo nights ago ? " The words baffled her . " How could you have known ? " He leaned close , uttering only a single syllable - a word whose significance she still did not fully understand : " X-ah . " " X-ahl " She said it back to him . " What is X-ah ? " " It is what brings the X-ooh . " " What is X-ooh ? " He opened his arms , reaching to embrace her . " The X-ooh , " he said , " is X-aha . " Long-Eyes took her to see the Elders , processing into a great chamber that glowed with blazing fire . Ribs hung from spits , dripping fat into the flames , filling the air with the smoke of X-eea flesh . And near the flames , impaled on blackened stakes , the beast 's severed head glowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sat with them , drinking from their bowls and listening as Long-Eyes clicked and whistled an improvised song about the power of X-aha . Again she shivered , thinking about how rapidly things had changed . For a scientist who had planned to devote a large part of her life to the impartial gathering of data , here was a new kind of accomplishment . She had become a warrior hero , a champion-the X-ooh from X-ah . To Alpha she said , " I could get used to this . " " No reason why you should n't . You 're one of them now . It 's an incredible opportunity . If only we could get your vision back online . " Long-Eyes returned to Cara 's side as a young song-singer launched into a whistling lyric about the power of the X-ooh . Long-Eyes said , " Your wounds are deep . " " Are they ? " She slurred the words . She did n't care . She was X-aha , the X-ooh from X-ah . If she could n't slur her words , who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are strong . " " Yes . " She raised her bowl . " And so is this . " She drank . " It is good you are strong . " " Yes . It is all good . " " And your things . They are strong , too . " " My things ? " He resorted to pidgin , using gestures to describe the auger that had directed the power beam . " No , " she said . " No more . " She raised her good hand , opening her fingers in a sign of letting go . " Gone ! " Eventually , she was going to have to return to her base . She would get Alpha to send her fresh supplies : another rover , a new unitard . But all that could wait for now . She leaned toward Long-Eyes . " But I have other things for you . Better things . " The words flowed , no longer impeded by doubt . " / will teach you . You will learn my ways , and I will master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and I will - " He tensed , drawing his shoulders together , leaning back in a troubled gesture . She asked , " What is wrong ? " " When will we find time for such idle things ! What of the X-eea ? " She glanced at the severed head . " What do you mean ? . " He looked confused . " You must help us fight it . " She froze , wondering if she had heard him correctly . " It , " he said . " You must help us fight it . " But the word he used was not it . In the native language , barely a half tone separated singular from plural . To human ears , even to gifted ones that had spent months studying the inflections , the difference was barely discernable . Cara drew an uneasy breath , letting it out in a constricted sigh : " Oh my god ! " She looked at Long-Eyes , holding his gaze as she spoke the pronoun again , giving it the proper inflection-the slightly higher tone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Oh my god ! " She reached out , grasping his arm . " Howmany ? " She swallowed . " Howmany of those monsters are there ! " He answered with a single word . " X-eeo . " She released his arm , sitting back as the expression quaked through her : X-eeo - the number beyond counting . He leaned closer . " At first they will come one at a time . But soon there will be many , then more-rising from the forest like a deadly crop . It is not always this way . Most winters it is only one ... or a few . Most seasons we can appease them with offerings , but X-ah tells us that this will be a winter of X-eeo X-eea - a winter like the one that destroyed the other villages . That is why we are glad that X-ah has sent you to us . We are glad to have such a powerful X-ooh . " Nearby , the young story-singer paused in his narrative . He turned to Long-Eyes , raised his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a powerful X-ooh ! " Others joined in , repeating the words , and soon the great dome reverberated with joyful praise . Long-Eyes leaned close . " Lookouts stand watch by the wall . They will let us know when the X-eea return . Until then , you must rest , collect your strength for the next battle . " Cara turned away , looking again at the beast 's head . " Alpha , " she said . " I 'm going to need some supplies . " She stood , testing the strength in her legs and discovering she could stand on her own . The ioom fell silent . " You hear me , Sister ? I need a transmission - supplies and personnel . " " Personnel ? " " I ca n't handle this alone . Send me Delta . " " No , " Alpha said . " Ca n't do that . No multiples in the field . You know the rules . " " Forget the rules . I need Delta .. . and rovers .. . and all the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta . It 's a breach of protocol . " " So breach it . " " You ca n't make that call . " Alpha 's voice rose , bordering on indignation . " I 'm the commander . Who do you think you are ? " Cara looked down at the pattern on her tunic : a lithe warrior riding a speeding wheel . When she answered , it was in the native tongue . " I am Xaha the X-ooh . " " You ca n't be serious . " " I ca n't be otherwise . Transmit Delta . Have her bring the supplies to the village . " Alpha did not respond . Cara gave up on her , took her seat , and tried thinking of another way . A minute passed . Then another . And then , in the distance , muffled thunder split the night . The villagers looked toward the dissipating roar , hands raised in amazement , nostrils flaring . They knew the sound . And Cara , although she had never heard it from so far away , recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the echo of what Long-Eyes had called clear-sky thunder . " Thank you , Alpha . " Cara looked up to find Long-Eyes staring at her . He asked , " You are talking to your X-ah ? " " Yes . " " You are making a plan to face the X-eeo X-eea ? " " Yes . " She considered the supply of raw-matter packets that Beta had brought in the lander . The supply was limited , but if she and her sisters began relying on the village to provide food and shelter , the packets could be used exclusively for personnel , rovers , and reflectors . She looked at Long-Eyes . " I need to explain . I need to tell you what I 'm going to do . " " No need for that . My own X-ah has told me . " He leaned closer , his nostrils flaring . He pressed his hands to his chest . " There is only one way to fight X-eeo X-eeNa . " He paused . She knew what he was going to say . They spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
