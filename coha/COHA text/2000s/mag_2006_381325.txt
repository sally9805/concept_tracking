India Ascending A democracy of more than 1 billion people , many profiting from a reformed economy , India is turning itself into a primary player in the global marketplace . Readers welcomed the rise of a free society , although not without a few misgivings from Americans about what it means for U.S. workers <P> As an Indian from Bombay , I loved reading your stories about my home country June 26 . From Tarrytown to Tallahassee , people are thinking about India . They want to know where Chennai and Hyderabad are on the map . Colleagues in the Midwest are rushing to do a stint working in India , which has come to be seen as a rung on the corporate ladder . Unlike China , which gate-crashed into Western households with everything from kitchen knives to toilet-tissue holders , India has made an unhurried entry through communication portals . But India must not allow corruption and bureaucratic incompetence to slow it down in the race with China . KRISH V. KRISHNAN Wilmette , Ill . <P> The Cover Story on the rise of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's problems were overwhelming , but there is hope for the masses of the subcontinent . It goes to show what can be accomplished by millions of people with a work ethic , an appreciation for education , a culture of thrift and family , and a recognition of the value of being able to speak English well in the global marketplace . PAUL H. GORE Oakland , Ore . <P> Your reporting stated that " Few modern Americans ... are shocked to hear how vital Indians have been to California 's high-tech industry . " With regard to outsourcing , you quoted an Indian executive 's observation that " the jobs will go to those who can do them best , in the most cost-effective manner . Geography is irrelevant . " So American workers are losing jobs to insourcing as well as outsourcing ! We ca n't get a break . JOSEPH MICHAEL SIMASEK Morganton , N.C. <P> At Odds over the War <P> In " Why Bush Is ( Still ) Winning The War at Home " June 26 , columnist Joe Klein asked , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bollixed about the war and for the President to seem so confident ? " The President 's political survival has been tied from Day One to never admitting a mistake . The Democrats , on the other hand , are looking carefully at the problems brought on by the President 's recklessness . Then , from their various viewpoints , they are attempting to propose policy solutions that might stand a chance of turning things around in Iraq or at least saving lives . What looks bollixed to Klein appears to me to resemble evidence of a genuine policy debate , which is what many Democrats ( and some Republicans ) have sought for months . TED PAULY New York City <P> Klein failed to provide any useful advice for the confused and divided Democrats , as they argue about withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq . He stated that the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq , Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi , was " eliminated through terrific intelligence work and air power , neither of which required a substantial U.S. ground presence in Iraq . " Klein ignored the tremendous value U.S. ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capability used to eliminate al-Zarqawi . ROBERT BILLINGS Lake Mary , Fla.
