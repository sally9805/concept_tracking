High definition is coming to your DVD player soon . Deciding which of two rival formats to buy might take longer . // Clearly , the era Of high-definition television ( HDTV ) is upon us . But buying one of these beautiful new displays is only half the equation-you need highdefinition content to take advantage of the greater detail that the technology provides . In the next year , two video disc standards , HD-DVD and Blu-ray , are headed your way , each competing to become the format that will replace DVD and rule your living room for the next decade or more . Which will prevail and which will become Betamax ? It 's too early to tell-and that 's not good news for anyone hoping to buy an HD player anytime soon . So consider this an advance scouting report rather than a mandate to pull out your wallet . In 1997 , DVDs brought digital video content into our homes by compressing high-quality video on an optical disc that holds about 9GB of information . Each frame of film is stored as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a resolution of 720 pixels horizontally and 480 pixels vertically . That 's not bad-until you compare it to HDTV , which is capable of 1920 x 1080 pixels per frame , or six times the resolution . Great-if you can find a digital video disc format large enough to store that much data . While HD-DVD and Blu-ray standards have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages , both provide the data storage capacity and the resulting high resolution necessary to show off our high-end televisions . Why the competing technologies ? Simple : The huge revenues expected from licensing . Philips , which developed the CD almost 30 years ago , still gets 0.02 cents from each album sold on the format . Whichever companyor group of companiesends up providing the technology to power the future of home entertainment stands to make a lot of cash . And almost as soon as the DVD hit the scene , large consortia began working on the technologies that would eventually become HD-DVD and Blu-ray . The HD-DVD standard was developed by the DVD Forum , a group of entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toshiba , that helped create the DVD standard . HD-DVDs can store about 30GB of digital information-not quite enough to hold an HD movie encoded in MPEG2 , the compression standard used in DVDs . But , this wo n't be a problem because HD-DVD supports new compression algorithms that allow it to squeeze more digital information into a smaller amount of disc space . An HD-DVD disc has plenty of room for HD content , with space left over for DVD-style extras such as interviews with a cast and crew . The HD-DVD consortium has a significant advantage over the competition : It 's fairly easy to convert facilities that manufacture standard DVDs into ones that pump out HD-DVDs , easing the transition for the companies that press movie discs . What does Blu-ray , HD-DVD 's competitor , offer ? For starters , Sony is one of its major backers . The Japanese behemoth not only commands a huge electronics arm , it also enjoys exclusive access to movies and music produced under its umbrella . The Blu-ray standard is almost guaranteed to have some content that the HD-DVD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the immediate future , if you want to see a Sony movie in HD , you 'll have to buy it on Blu-ray . But that 's not all Bluray brings to the table . Technologically , the disc is superior , using a double-layer technique that compresses almost 50GB of information onto a disc the same size as an HD-DVD . That leaves plenty of room for today 's material , with an added bonus : space to accommodate video at a higher resolution than HDTV currently supports . On the downside-and it 's a major drawback-this technology requires all-new manufacturing equipment , meaning a greater initial investment for disc makers . The additional costs presumably will be passed on to the consumer . Both HD-DVD and Blu-ray video players should be on the market by the end of this year ( Blu-ray recorders are already available in Japan for $1900 to $2700 ) , along with the first wave of movie titles to watch on the shiny set-top boxes . HD-DVD will probably make its way into stores a couple of months ahead of Blu-ray . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing and will likely ship with a greater selection of movie titlesthough , as noted above , at higher prices . What would I buy ? The wisest course is to wait for the dust to settle before putting your money into either kind of system . Of course , wisdom does n't always win out . If you absolutely ca n't wait , you can take your chances with either of the systems when they come out and be the first on your block to play video discs in lifelike high-def quality . If you 're willing to delay gratification a bit longer , a more economical choice will be available when Sony launches its PlayStation 3 gaming console , expected sometime in late 2005 or early 2006 . It will support Bluray movie playback out of the box . ( Then , if there 's HD-DVD content you want to watch and you just ca n't hold off , you 'll have to buy an HD-DVD player as well . That 's half the fun of being an early adopter : You get to buy twice as many toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of both worlds : a hybrid machine . Yes , it 's certainly possible that either HD-DVD or Blu-ray will win out over the next nine months , with the other technology bowing out gracefully . But that result seems increasingly unlikely , given the tremendous monetary stakes . Eventually , someone will make a hybrid player that supports both formats . And that 's the one to look out for . <p>
