Il n'y a pas de malheur pire que celui qu'on a. <br>  --  Arab Proverb <p> <p> I could start like this , third-person omniscient : " She chucked it all and moved to Paris . " I like " chucked it all , " as if you could shove chunks of your life out the door of a moving vehicle , say a 1968 Chevrolet Camaro , newly restored on fat tires , vintage Beastie Boys playing in the background . Or how about " She picked up and left , " with its faux-folksiness , a hair away from " she jes ' plum picked up and left , Jed . " As if one could pack one 's possessions in a skirt and hoist it up , hoops and crinoline , and take off . Then there 's that slightly perplexing " picked up . " It reminds me of my childhood jackstraws game . All those plastic , bone-colored pieces . A hoe jimmied up by a rake or a sword or a trowel . The first few rounds are always carefree , reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence rule the game . When everything hinges on the last move . <p> Or no dodge-and-weave , no embroidery , no third-person , no all-knowing voice : I left . It was easy for me to move to Paris , and I had to leave . <p> Like that . One day , my life became unbearable : straw , camel , back , and the unmistakable sound of splinters , or whatever a broken heart sounds like to the possessor ( for the record : shattering glass , snapping tennis racket strings , the braying of world-weary donkeys , the high-pitched , internal bat-squeak of air being forced through congested sinuses , to name a few ) . I called my gabby travel agent . Many minutes and credit card numbers later , I had a ticket and a week to pack and get my life in order . <p> It was n't as wacky as it sounds . I had dual citizenship and some mad money stashed away ; my copywriting gig for an entertainment PR firm was portable ; and , in a neat trick , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let my parents know I needed a change of pace . I knew better than to tell them the real reason I was leaving town . If I told my mother , she 'd worry the entire time I was gone , and I could n't tell my father . He was so unnerved by any display of emotional distress that he invariably shut down , his eyes either glazing over or darting back and forth in search of the nearest possible exit . All of my friends figured a change would do me good . Except Lindsay . <p> " Anna , you 're running away , " she said , point-blank on the phone . As if the accusation , like a bullet , would stop me in my tracks . I could picture her in her stainless-steel kitchen , baby Ethan balanced on her hip , while she edited a movie trailer on three iMacs and purTed organic bok choy . Ever since she 'd become a mother , she 'd had no time for anyone 's bullshit , least of all mine . <p> Figuring there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am , " nearly like a country singer . I felt giddy . " And righteous about it , " I added . I emptied a box of chewy caramel calcium supplements into a Ziploc bag and listened to her exhale long and impatiently . Surveying the somber piles of clothing around me , I thought of something Hank Williams Jr . had said about black being good for funerals and everything else . <p> " Remember when I was having a rough time ? How I wanted to get in a boat and take off ? But I knew that once I got in the boat and put out to sea , all my problems would crawl out of the woodwork , I knew they 'd find a way onboard as stowaways . " She was relentless , a Sherman tank of run-on sentences . My nose twitched . There was a prettier way of telling it , and she 'd butchered the metaphor . " You have obligations , responsibilities , " she added . <p> " Actually , I do n't , " I uttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any commitments , and being in this city has become unbearable . I ca n't stay here . " The last sentence came out like a low howl , barely restrained from being frightening . I could have used the word " keening . " It would have been right . <p> She was quiet . Remarshaling forces . " What , you think they do n't have People magazine in Paris ? " she countered . <p> " Do n't . " <p> " I bet they even have Entertainment Tonight . Dubbed , but still . " <p> " Now you 're being mean , " I tried . <p> " Just move on ! Deal with it ! " she yelled . " You 're not the first person in the world this has happened to ! " Very , very gently , as if in slow motion , I put the phone back in its cradle and tiptoed away . <p> It was going to be a while before she forgave me ; we were n't hang-up-acceptable sorts of friends . I was setting fire to lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks into shoes . It was probably simplistic , but I had a notion that the universe worked in a few key ways and I was n't ready to give up on them . I believed most people were supposed to find each other and , if they were so inclined , have kids ; that is , people who wanted to do that sort of thing . Not that it was supposed to be perfect . Sometimes it worked , sometimes it did n't . Sometimes someone died , or they broke up , or random tragedy struck ( though I could get paranoid about driving on the freeway , I tended to confine this line of thinking to natural disasters and times of war ) . I was a late bloomer , but I 'd finally figured out that I wanted to be part of that world . <p> So , when I met and fell in love with Timothy , I thought I was following the master plan , the great scheme . ( " Yay ! " the lemmings cry as they rush the cliff en masse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was The One . But the relationship conjugated itself differently : I met Timothy , I fell in love with Timothy , I had my heart broken by Timothy . Amo , amas , amok . It took less than six months . <p> <br> Continues ...
