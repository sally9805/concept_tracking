<p> Like rival armies locked in trench warfare , activists supporting and opposing legal rights for same-sex couples are regrouping after bitter election campaigns and girding for future struggles that will likely divide America for many years to come . <p> In state capitols , courthouses and corporate boardrooms , gay marriage and its variants - civil unions and domestic partnerships - will be an inescapable topic for policy-makers , executives and religious leaders . <p> In Texas , conservative legislators will try this year to make their state the 35th to adopt a law or constitutional amendment banning gay marriage . In New York and Rhode Island , gay lawmakers will introduce bills to legalize it . <p> " It is n't going to happen overnight - there will be setbacks and right-wing backlash , " said Evan Wolfson , a leading gay-rights lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund . " That 's exactly how every civil rights movement in American history has proceeded . " <p> Last spring , gay-rights activists were elated when Vermont enacted its landmark civil-unions law , becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to same-sex couples . <p> In November , Democratic Gov . Howard Dean - who signed the bill - survived an election challenge by a foe of civil unions , but more than 20 legislators who had supported the law were defeated . In Nebraska and Nevada , ballot initiatives proposing to ban same-sex marriage were approved with 70 percent support . <p> " This will be a long-term battle , like abortion , " said Peter LaBarbera , president of Americans for Truth , a Washington , D.C. , group that opposes legal recognition of gay couples . <p> " The people on our side are every bit as committed as the people on their side , " he said . <p> While Nevadans must vote again in 2002 before that state 's constitutional amendment takes force , the Nebraska constitutional amendment has gone into effect - and already is a prime target for the gay-rights movement . <p> The American Civil Liberties Union , backed by other groups , is preparing a lawsuit challenging the amendment , which goes further than other states ' laws . The amendment bans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic partnerships , civil unions " and other similar same-sex relationships . " <p> " It 's been sold as a Defense of Marriage amendment , but it 's really an anti-family amendment , " said Tim Butz , executive director of the Nebraska ACLU . " It makes it difficult , if not impossible , for a gay or lesbian family to plan for the future , for the adoption of children , division of property . " <p> Butz expects the legal challenge to take several years and likely reach the U.S. Supreme Court . <p> " This is a national battleground here , " Butz said . " If this amendment withstands the legal challenges we 're going to mount , the other side can go forward with more confidence elsewhere . " <p> Indeed , backers of the Nebraska amendment are urging other states to broaden their existing Defense of Marriage laws to address civil unions . The aim would be to deter couples from going to Vermont for a civil union ceremony , then returning home to claim legal recognition . <p> " Homosexual activists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Guyla Mills , a leader of the campaign on behalf of the Nebraska amendment . " I 've had many states contact me , interested in doing the same thing we did . " <p> Mills moved after the election to Virginia , taking a job with Kerusso Ministries , a Christian group that encourages gays to change their sexual orientation . In a telephone interview , she spoke repeatedly of animosity generated during the Nebraska campaign . <p> " It 's becoming harder and harder for people to express any kind of opposition to the homosexual agenda for fear of being called hate mongers , " she said . " I 'm not one to throw in the towel . ... We 're going to hold ground . We 're going to take back ground . " <p> Amy Desai , a policy analyst for the conservative group Focus on the Family , said proponents of gay marriage underestimate the grassroots opposition to their cause . <p> " It has been debated in ivory tower settings , by the Hollywood crowd , the political pundits , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until this point , had n't viewed this as a real threat . Now they 're waking up and saying , ' You ca n't force such a radical change on us without us becoming very angry . " ' <p> In Texas , where state law explicitly defines marriage as between a man and a woman , some conservatives nonetheless want to join the majority of other states in enacting a Defense of Marriage law . <p> State Rep. Warren Chisum , who unsuccessfully sponsored similar bills in 1997 and 1999 , says he will try again this year . <p> " The chances do look better , " Chisum said . " After Vermont 's fiasco , there is a growing support to step up to the table and do the right thing . " <p> To Texas gay-rights activists , Chisum 's bill is vindictive . <p> " We already we know we ca n't get married here , " said Diane Hardy-Garcia , executive director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Lobby of Texas . " The only thing that can happen with this is division and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year is a hate-crimes bill . <p> " Those of us from conservative Southern states have to be very realistic about what we do , " she said . " Legislators would think I 'm crazy if I went up and asked them to pass a marriage bill right now . " <p> In New York and Rhode Island , however , openly gay legislators plan to introduce gay-marriage bills this year . <p> Rhode Island Rep. Michael Pisaturo is unsure whether his bill will get through the House Judiciary Committee , but said he is intent on persevering year after year until he prevails or loses his seat . <p> " Most of my colleagues realize it 's the right and fair thing to do , " he said . " But politically , it 's a different story . Most politicians really worry about getting re-elected . " <p> Pisaturo has rejected suggestions that he propose civil unions , rather than full-fledged marriage <p> " I ca n't accept anything the codifies in statute my second-class citizenship , " he said . <p> In New York , state Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil unions and the other full-fledged marriage for same-sex couples , according to his chief of staff , Andrew Berman . <p> " We see these two as long-term projects , " said Berman , explaining that Duane 's proposals would lack teeth until other anti-discrimination measures are enacted . <p> Despite the efforts of Pisaturo and Duane , the director of the ACLU 's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project does n't expect any state to swiftly endorse gay marriage . <p> " There is n't another Vermont on the short-term horizon , " said Matt Coles . " It will look like there 's a pause in the movement . But I say to people , ' Look more closely . " ' <p> He said polls now suggest a majority of Americans favor some legal rights for gay couples , albeit not official marital status . He also noted the increasing number of corporations extending domestic-partnership benefits to gay employees . <p> " Ten years ago there were just a handful of companies doing that , " Coles said . " Now , it 's becoming the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing empathy for gays and lesbians among young Americans , as evidenced by the spread of gay-straight alliances at high schools and colleges . <p> " The young people get it , " said Deanna Kaffke , a gay-rights leader who teaches at the University of Nebraska . " Even with a conservative student body , a majority of students on campus see that this is a civil rights issue . " <p> If Vermont 's civil union law has helped galvanize opposition to gay marriage , it also has inspired many same-sex couples . Among them are Marcie Elias and Hillary Smith , partners for more than two years in New York City who are planning a civil-union ceremony later this year in Vermont . <p> Elias , 28 , described herself as " very traditional . " <p> " I 've always envisioned myself getting married and having a home . When I came out , that never changed . " <p> Many gay couples see no need for a formal ceremony , she said , " but in my mind it 's important to get up in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with . " ' <p> Elias , a management consultant , predicted that a steady stream of same-sex couples would go to Vermont to enter civil unions , then return home and seek legal benefits reserved for heterosexual married couples . <p> " They 'll get their requests denied and eventually it 's going to work its way to the courts , " she said . " As more and more gay couples start clamoring for legal rights and protections , it will become more and more of an administrative nightmare for the states . " <p> Wolfson , the Lambda Defense Fund attorney , agreed that civil unions made in Vermont would spawn lawsuits . <p> " This is not some chess game , " he said . " These are real people who have entered a serious legal relationship . As they encounter discrimination or even uncertainties , there will be litigation . It will arise out of genuine crisis . " <p> Milton Regan , a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pivotal battleground over the next several years as gay couples seek broader rights . <p> " The growing recognition from the corporate sector begins to confer some legitimacy , " Regan said . " But it 's not going to be inexorable , and there will be backlashes in many areas . It 's one of those battlegrounds in which there is lurching in one direction and the other - another front in the cultural war .
