The job of a professional fishing captain is a demanding one that requires talent and hard work , along with expert boat-handling skills , savvy angling know-how and a healthy dose of diplomacy . There are thousands of captains plying waters throughout the U.S. today , but among them , a few newer faces on the scene are making impressive strides in the sport . Here are five of the best and brightest sportfishing captains who make it all look easy . Capt . Amanda Switzer , East Hampton , N.Y . As a maverick in a male-dominated profession , 35-year-old Switzer has been guiding fly-fishing clients to striped bass off Long Island for the last six years . She started fishing off docks when she was 10 before moving on to shark and tuna boats once she got older . After discovering fly fishing and meeting Montauk 's pioneer guide Paul Dixon , Switzer got her captain 's license and started working for Dixon before striking out on her own two years later . These days she 's on the water an average of 200 days during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on , her anglers sight-fish as Switzer poles her Grand Slam skiff and spots up to 200 fish a day . As summer fades into fall , she switches to a 21-foot Parker center console to take advantage of the false albacore runs and feeding blitzes off the island . By November , she 's targeting trophy stripers following the herring migration . Among her clients ' accomplishments ? A 30-pound striper and a 100-pound bluefin tuna landed off Montauk Point ; both catches were on fly tackle . " What 's the drawback of being out every day in nature ? None ! " Switzer says . " There 's nothing I 'd rather do at this stage in my life than be a striper guide . But I do n't have too many fishing snobs on my boat . We 'll chase whatever 's going off , whether it 's bluefish , albies or bass . " Capt . John Bushell , Freeport , Texas . Growing up in Fort Lauderdale , John Bushell 's father put the salt in his veins . It remained there , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a warehouse manager for a large furniture store . Five years later , when the long hours finally took their toll , 33-year-old Bushell gave his notice , moved aboard his boat in Freeport and never looked back . A series of freelance gigs as a mate and charter captain followed before yacht-broker friend Jim Peachey helped him land his first regular position on a 42 Hatteras . Bushell eventually married his boss ' daughter before moving on to his present position as full-time captain of Sandman , a 2005 Hatteras 60 owned by Roy Weatherford and his wife , Bonnie . Bushell and the Weatherford family ( Roy 's mom and dad are regular anglers ) use the boat to relax and fun fish from their home port at the Bridge Harbor Marina in Freeport . Favorite trips include overnight jaunts into the central Gulf of Mexico to billfish by day and tuna fish all night . Extended cruises to the Bahamas and an annual three-month pilgrimage to Isla Mujeres , Mexico , add spice for this Lone Star fishing team . Bushell counts a triple hook-up on 500-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his more memorable moments as a captain . " The best part of this job is the adrenalin rush you get when a blue marlin peels off drag or is on the wire , " he says . " Being away from my two kids can be tough at times , but five years from now I hope to still be working for the Weatherford family on a new Harteras 60 . " Capt Adam Fox , Cape May , N J. Thirty-year-old Adam Fox learned his profession early . His dad had a wooden , refurbished Chris-Craft and father and son were constantly exploring the coastal Jersey shore together . As he got older , Adam worked around marinas in the summer , and by the time he was 18 was crewing on offshore charter boats out of Cape May and Ocean City , Md . A degree in management from Stockton College provided a brief interlude before Fox started working full-time for his current boss , Gus Pasquarella , in 1996 . The Pasquarella family and guests enjoy fun fishing and shark tournaments throughout the early summer aboard Reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season rolls around , it 's all business for this crew . They regularly fish the Mid-Atlantic $500,000 Tournament , the Ocean/Viking Showdown and several other local club events each season . Winters are spent chasing sailfish in the Florida Keys . Fox and Company won $50,000 with a 268-pound mako during a South Jersey Shark Tournament and they 've also released blue marlin in the 400-pound range . " My biggest thrill is backing down on a jumping sailfish . That 's my big thing , but I also enjoy teaching my boss and his family and guests how to fish . The more fish I can put them on , the better they 'll get . This is a fun job , it really is . " Capt . Michael Shrosbree , Dana Point , Calif . Shrosbree , who is 35 , grew up learning to fish with his father and by the time he was 20 , he had his own skiff and knew he wanted to eventually be a sport-fishing captain . After working as a deckhand for two years , he earned his license and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eureka , a Cabo 47 based in Dana Point , nearly three years ago . Eureka is owned by Craig Nickoloff , a West Coast restaurateur who uses the boat for himself and as a benefit for his employees . Shrosbree targets a wide variety of So-Cal species , including halibut , white sea bass , marlin and tuna . He fishes a number of Balboa Angling Club tournaments and every October runs to Cabo San Lucas , Mexico , for the winter , where guests fly in and fish a couple of days each week . During a local tournament , Shrosbree and Team Eureka hooked an estimated 400-pound swordfish on light line and fought the fish for more than 11 hours . In six-foot seas and high winds at 3 a.m. , the fish was finally pulled on to the swim platform with two flying gaffs . " It just had too much will to live , " Shrosbree recalls . " It tore the gaffs out and we lost him , but it sure was a memorable fight . " I love the whole package of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean and yachts and I really enjoy entertaining our guests . My goal is to help them leave the boat better anglers than when they arrived . " Capt . Mike Pittiglio , St. Clair Shores , Mich . Destiny played a big role in 30-year-old Mike Pittiglio 's decision to become a full-time muskellunge guide four years ago . Even though he was an avid fisherman and owned his first boat at age 19 , a career in engineering kept Pittiglio off the water more than he wanted . When he decided to buy Muskie Mania , a 31 Sea Ray Amberjack , and start chartering , he was laid off from his engineering job the same day he was scheduled to close on his boat loan . He bought the boat anyway and is now one of the premier muskie guides in the Great Lakes region . Pittiglio fishes Lake St. Clair exclusively , 95 percent of the time in Canadian waters . His specialty is power trolling using boat rods and planer boards . He runs 120 trips annually from the first of June until December 15 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskies , including 12 over 30 pounds . On one trip ( six hours of actual fishing ) , they landed 27 out of 35 bites . The majority of the fish are released . One angler , 81-year-old Walter Skszek of Belleville , Mich. , celebrated his birthday by boating a 38-pound , 56-inch muskie , the biggest of his life and Pittiglio 's career . That evening , Pittiglio 's wife gave birth to their child . " What I enjoy most about guiding is meeting a wide variety of people , " Pittiglio says . " You run into all types of occupations and personalities . I want to fish until I retire or die , I love it so much . " Illustration <p>
