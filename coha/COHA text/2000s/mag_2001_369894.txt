The 450 freshmen and sophomores gathered in the auditorium of Stephenson High School in Stone Mountain , Ga. , are contemplating a red poster with a drawing of a large angry face and the word BULLY . That poster and two others , marked VICTIM and BYSTANDER , form the backdrop for the action onstage . Victor  --  with his black beret and long , stringy hair that scream " Victim ! "  --  is enduring a stream of abuse from Brad . " I can call you anything I want because I 'm a man and you 're a punk sissy nerd ! " Brad shouts after stealing Victor 's hat . The audience laughs hysterically . " We do n't want punk sissy nerds like you hanging around our school . Right ? " asks Brad , prompting the watching kids to chant " Punk sissy nerd " in an unconscious display of bystander cravenness . But when the play is over , the students are more reflective . " It was really good , " says Shina Mills , a sophomore . " It helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get help . " <P> A skit about big bad bullies may seem ludicrously quaint against the backdrop of teen shootings like the one last week in El Cajon , Calif . But the professional production , part of the local school district 's efforts to combat bullying , seeks in a small way to change the weekly headlines . More and more schools around the country are implementing antibullying policies . New laws in Georgia , New Hampshire and Vermont require them , and Colorado , home to the Columbine school massacre , is debating a measure . Skeptics say such legislation is fruitless and serves merely as a platform for politicians to display their practiced empathy . But some innovative programs around the country are showing concrete results that challenge the laissez-faire mentality that , after all , kids will be kids . <P> That bullying is a destructive force is not in dispute . Last fall the National Threat Assessment Center , run by the U.S. Secret Service , found that in more than two-thirds of 37 recent school shootings , the attackers felt " persecuted , bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why more than 160,000 children skip school every day , according to the National Association of School Psychologists . <P> Georgia began its pioneering efforts to legislate against bullying after two school tragedies . In 1994 Brian Head , a chubby , bespectacled 15-year-old who had been taunted for years , broke when a classmate at Etowah High School in Woodstock slapped him . He shouted , " I ca n't take it anymore ! , " pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head . Four years later , Josh Belluardo was punched in the head  --  and killed  --  by a bully who also attended Etowah . The next year , Georgia passed a **28;12908;TOOLONG policy . After three bullying offenses , middle and high school students may be shipped to a school for problem kids .
