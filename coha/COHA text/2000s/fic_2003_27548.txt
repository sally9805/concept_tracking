THIS COLD COUNTRY By Annabel Davis-Goff Harcourt , Inc . No one liked the rats , and only Daisy felt any affection for the ferrets . She liked the thickness of their coats , their efficient sharp teeth , and their stubborn refusal to establish a relationship with their owners , oras Daisy , and maybe the ferrets themselves , thought of the humans who caged themtheir captors . The ferrets worked for their keep . No bargain had been struck . They did what they would have done in nature and in return were fed with food they would not have needed had they not lived in captivity . They seemed aware of this , Daisy thought , and their constant vigilance and ready teeth seemed to her less an instinctive reaction than a conscious wish to sink their teeth gum deep into the wrists of the humans who exploited them . Although she was not unsympathetic to their plight , the rough treatment , the small , dirty , and foul-smelling cages in which they lived , Daisy was determined not to become an object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferret by the neck , lift the temporarily powerless creature , and drop it into the sack used to transport them . It was a skill she had learned less reluctantly than when she had been taught to snap the neck of her first rabbit , the rabbit itself a victim of the unnatural alliance between ferret and man . It had struggled in her hands ; she could feel its warmth , its weight , its terror . She had been appalled by what she was doing and had been clumsy , failing to snap the rabbit 's neck at her first attempt ; Frank , the shepherd who was instructing her , had had to finish killing it . She had vomited afterwarda little way off , behind a bushand Frank had pretended not to notice either that or the tears that she wiped away with the sleeve of her jacket . Although Daisy had enlisted in a branch of His Majesty 's Services the day after war was declared , it was the Women 's Land Army and she had been sent to a farm in Walesso far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rabbits , and the greatest danger she had faced had been a sharp nip from a ferret . " Can I come , too ? " A child , Sarah , stood on the badly lit landing outside the nursery bathroom . An only child , she was holding a tatty doll dressed in expensive baby clothes . Daisy shook her head . " Take Dolly back to the nursery and make sure Marmalade is there . Then close the door . I 'll come and tell you afterward . " Sarah trotted obediently along the landing , proud of the responsibility . Daisy watched her go ; Sarah 's gait had a little bounce that made her seem to float for an instant between steps . It always gave Daisy pleasure . Although Sarah left her doll in the nursery when she took a bath , Marmaladethe old black Labradoraccompanied her every time she ventured into the chilly bathroom . When Daisy wanted a long soak after a cold day 's hard workplenty of hot water was one of the luxuries at Aberneth Farmshe usually rousted the old dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bath mat . Marmalade was more a talisman against the rats than a practical deterrent . The rats , far from desperate , were not likely to invade the bathroom while humans were there . But , if she entered the room quietly , there was sometimes a sinister scrabbling sound and occasionally even the glimpse of a naked , obscene , gray tail disappearing under the tub . The rats came up under the bath . Where the pipes came through the floor they had gnawed the edge of the wood and were able , it seemed , temporarily to flatten their bodies and squeeze through before returning to their usual surprisingly large size . Under the bath and in one corner of the skirting board , pieces of tin cans had been hammered out and nailed over holes . Similar metal barriers , less skillfully worked , covered corners of the barn floor and the small room where the feeding grain was stored . With her right handthe ferret dangling helplessly from her leftDaisy locked the bathroom door . Losing a ferret was an eventuality as eagerly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light did little to alleviate the gloom under the large iron tub that lay close to the linoleum-covered floor . The narrowness of the dusty space between its heavy iron base and the hole the rats shared with the plumbing pipes made it impossible effectively to seal the gap . The ferret averted his nose as Daisy pointed him at the small dark hole ; then , when she persisted , pushing his unmuzzled snout down beside the drainpipe , with a wiggle , as she released him , he was gone . Daisy stood at the window and waited . She did not expect the return of the ferret , which she had privately named Sebastian . Although the ferrets had not been given names , Daisy had once overheard the gardenerin whose shed they lived , and who fed themcall one of them Fred . His tone , if not of affection , then of familiarity . Nevertheless , she had to stay . If Sebastian-Fred returned and she were not there , he represented a danger to the next person entering the bathroom . Or , she considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring the logistics of " what if " ) what a problem she would have set herself if she were on the other side of the closed bathroom door attempting to enter in order to recapture a not so small , fierce creature while preventing it from fleeing , with or without a passing nip , between her ankles and disappearing into the recesses of the large old houseforever . Seen only when it came on food raids or waged intermittent guerrilla warfare against the legitimate inhabitants , a scapegoat and a reproach to Daisy for years to come . " Daisy 's ferret " they would call it , she thought dreamily , pleasantly aware of the smell of baking drifting up from the kitchen below . The window overlooked fields and a copse of gnarled trees , behind which , unseen , lay the sea . It was from here that Daisy had first seen the sky light up when the oil storage tanks nearly fifty miles away had been bombed . A scream from the kitchen below suggested the return of Sebastian was now unlikely , and Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; like many of the doors at Aberneth Farm , it required a tug after it seemed closed to ensure the click that prevented it slowly reopening when the house settled on its timbers , or when the persistent drafts in the upstairs corridors , supplemented by the wind outside , reached the proportions of a small indoor gale . Hurrying down the back stairs , the thick wool of her stockinged feet ( her muddy gumboots stood side by side outside the back door ) catching unpleasantly on the dry splintered wood of the steps , Daisy reached the kitchen . By the range , Mrs. Thomas , the cook , remained on duty beside a large and fragrant pot , permitting herself only an expression of extreme disapproval while Elsie , the housemaid , stood to one side of the door leading to the scullery , intermittently screaming . Tabitha , the kitchen cat , an animal that Daisy had never before seen awake , now stood , arch-backed , bristling , on the table , a primitive , dangerous glare in her eyes . Daisy was not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it would not be wise to touch her . " Where is he ? " Daisy asked . Mrs. Thomas 's lips remained pursed , but Elsie pointed to the larder , a small dark room off the scullery . Daisy , following Elsie 's pointed finger , stepped into the room , closed the door , and turned on the light . Behind her , the screaming stopped . She could hear the sound of the wireless from a shelf behind the range . Moments later , she recrossed the kitchen , the ferret held out from her body ; dangling helplessly from her hand . Elsie looked at her with an expression that contained both respect and disdain ; Mrs. Thomas merely shook her head , indicating that were there not a war on , she would not , for a moment , put up with that kind of carry-on in her kitchen . Hearing the newscaster 's words , Daisy paused by the kitchen door . The two women looked at her pointedly ; she had not been invited to remain in their territory , particularly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . After a moment , they followed her gaze to the wireless and they , too , heard and began to comprehend the words . Daisy silently indicated the set with a gesture of her head and Mrs. Thomas reached up and increased the volume , at the same time adjusting the tuning so that the voice , although still overlaid with static , was easier to understand . The three women and the inert ferret stood still while a Welsh voicethe BBC broadcasting from Cardiffannounced the sinking of the Royal Oak in Scapa Flow . THE LIBRARY WAS the warmest room in the house . Daisy closed the door behind her , aware that her entrance was heralded by a blast of cold air from the hall . As she came around the strategically placed screen , the change in temperature reinforced the impression of a small enchanted pre-war room , one in which now sat three young , attractive , and laughing people . Rosemary , Daisy 's employerfor although Daisy had enlisted in the Land Army and had been issued a uniform , it was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid her at the end of each weeksat in a low armchair beside the fire , a tea tray on a low table in front of her . Even the two menone a little older than Daisy , the other perhaps in his late twentiesin uniform , smiling and healthy , suggested nothing more ominous than a stint in a smart regiment . At Rosemary 's feet , Margo , the older black Labrador , snoozed ; Rosemary looked up with a welcoming smile as Daisy entered . " Daisy , you 're just in time for a cup of tea , " she said . Daisy hesitated . She was aware of the figure she cut : stocking-footed , an inert ferret held a little away from her body . Rosemary , in contrast , was wearing a tweed skirt and a light brown twinset ; her low-heeled shoes were elegant and well polished . Only her hands , her wedding and engagement rings emphasizing her short nails and reddened skin , suggested that she was not presiding over tea at a peacetime house party . " Daisy , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's by way of being a kind of cousin too . Daisy Creed . " " I just came " Daisy said awkwardly . " There 's something on the wirelessI was in the kitchen . A battleship called the Royal Oak has been sunk . In the Orkney Islandssomewhere called Scapa Flow . " The two men exchanged glancesDaisy had the impression that the mention of Scapa Flow had caused a greater reaction even than had the sinking of the battleshipand the younger , James , turned on the wireless that sat on the table beside him . It was tuned to the BBC , and after a moment Daisy heard the same bulletin that had been broadcast in the kitchen . All four looked at the wireless and listened to the account of the Royal Oak , sunk at anchor by a German submarine . Seven hundred and eighty-six officers and men dead . " Dear God , " Rosemary said softly . For an instant no one spoke or moved . Daisy felt as though she were part of a painting or photograph commemorating a moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it to her . " They are n't supposed to be able to get into Scapa Flow , " James said . " They tried during the Great War . In 1918 , a submarine , manned entirely by officers , was destroyed in the attempt , " Patrick said to Rosemary . " The tides and currents and the difficulty of navigating the channels were enough to keep the fleet safe from submarines ... then . The Admiralty thought they still were . " " So what 'll they do now ? " she asked . " Find a way of keeping the subs out , or move somewhere else . Rosyth , probably . It was the main base at the end of the last war . But now you 'd have to worry about air raids . " After a moment the newscaster repeated information he had already read and the tableau unfroze . Daisy was aware of how awkwardly she was placed . She was unable to drink her tea since it was all she could do to balance the saucer and spoon while Sebastian twitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scones . Delicious , although I do n't know how you are going to eat them with that thing in your hand . Maybe one of you chaps would like to hold Daisy 's pet . " Patrick reduced the volume of the wireless a little and turned toward Daisy . " Is n't there somewhere we can park that brute ? " he asked . " Turn a wastepaper basket upside down and pop it under , " James suggested . " She will if you sit on top of the basket , " Rosemary said . " I will if you get him out afterward , " Daisy said , the grasping of the ferret by the scruff of his neck being the only part of the operation that entailed either skill or risk . " Put your cup and saucer on the table , " Patrick said , indicating the round table that stood a couple of feet away . " That way you can drink your tea . " As Daisy sipped her tea , all four listened again to the sparse account offered by the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll turn on again at six o'clock , " he said . Daisy put her cup down and went out to take Sebastian back to his cage in the gardener 's shed . As she stepped into her gumboots outside the kitchen door she wondered what would happen if England lost the war . It was not a question she had ever heard asked . RABBIT STEW FOR dinner . The two men had left , and dinner was , as usual , a female affair . Daisy looked forward to meals ; she was young and hardworking and often she ate because she was tired . The food at Aberneth Farm was good . Maintaining a prewar standard of cooking was Mrs. Thomas 's war effort . Mrs. Thomas complained about wartime shortages , but having accepted a sympathetic hearing as her due , she turned around and adapted her recipes . Before she came to Aberneth Farm , Daisy had never eaten rabbit . The stew had a rich , thick brown sauce , made with herbs , and over the top were sprinkled toasted breadcrumbs . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parsley , and the carrots in the stew came from the garden . Daisy ate heartily , but Valerie , the other Land Girl , picked at the meat . There was a small heap on the side of her plate , rejected as not immediately identifiable . It had been agreed Valerie was conservative about her food . What Rosemary , and for that matter Daisy , really meant was Valerie was suburban , but they did n't say it , even when they were alone together . Although Daisy and Rosemary had become friends , Rosemary knew that if she were to preside over an efficiently and harmoniously run house and farm , there could be no suggestion of factions , favoritism , or , worse still , acknowledgment ofor alliances formed alongclass lines . Daisy thought that even if there had not been rabbit for dinner , Valerie would have been off her feed because she had missed the teatime visit of the two young officers . War , for Valerie , who had been born and bred in Tunbridge Wells , was a catalytic event that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outbreak of war had , seemingly miraculously , provided her with an opportunity to meet , ensnare , and marry an officer who originated from somewhere more promising than Kent . The news that two young men from regiments not usually accessible had passed through the house unmet by her seemed unnecessarily unfair . Especially since she was ready for them . Valerie prided herself on not having let herself go although she worked on a farm . She and Daisy were paid one pound a week and were entitled to a day off . Daisy saved a day each month and had accrued a few more when Valerie asked her to fill in for her in order to be able to attend some distant officer-heavy social engagement . Valerie was made of sterner stuff ; every second day off was entirely spent in beauty preparations . Her hair was shampooed with Stablonde , a mask superimposed over her face , her hands encased in gloves filled with almond oil . Eyebrows were plucked and feet were pedicured . She would appear , those evenings for dinner , looking radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs to bed her expression would have turned to one of vaguely confused disappointment .
