" L'Etat , c'est moi ! " proclaimed Louis XIV . " Ich bin ein Beilinez ! " goofed John F. Kennedy . With a bit more of the latter than the former in mind , Richard Mueller gives us a story that starts in Hollywood and ends up ... well , wait until you see where it ends up . Mr. Mueller knows his way around Hollywood , having written scripts for a variety of shows . Over the last year he has been a writing teacher/mentor , screen extra , political campaign coordinator , personal assistant and cat sitter ; though mostly he just writes . His last story for us was " few if By Sea " in our May issue . <p> I HAD BEEN KEPT ALONE FOR the better part of a week . I was fuzzy on the time because they kept a light burning in my cell and pushed my meals in through a slot in the door . The toilet hole - actually an oubliette in the floor stank , and I was almost out of the rough paper towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and infested with creatures that wandered about but , mercifully , did not bite . My clothes were foul . I was at the end of my wits . Luckily I was being held captive by my own countrymen . It would have been worse if the Iraqis or al-Qaeda had gotten to me first . After this low - grade misery had gone on for several days my door opened . There was a man in dress greens , a tall black man who looked just enough like Denzel Washington to give me hope , yet not enough to put me at ease . I was beyond that . The brassard on his pocket read TALIAFERO , and there were captain 's bars on his collar . " Mr. McNary ? " His was a voice deep and melodious , befitting his image . I looked around . " I guess so , " I said . " I 'm the only one here . " He smiled , a becoming smile . I refused to react . " Well , I 'm glad you have n't lost your sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask what I 'm charged with ? " " Nothing yet , " he said . " Would you come with me ? " I got to my feet and walked out into the corridor , which was lit with bare bulbs behind wire screens . The decor matched my cell . An airborne trooper with an assault rifle was watching and fell in behind us as we walked down the hall . " Sorry about the smell , " I muttered . I was shaky . Any poise I had previously possessed was gone . " Sorry about your incarceration . That should end soon . We just need to hear your story . " " Again ? " " I 'm sorry . " " You 're awfully conciliatory for a jailer , " I said . " Thank you . " We stopped before a steel door , painted red , with a handle like a walk-in meat freezer . I did n't like the looks of it but before I could say anything , Taliafero grabbed the handle and pulled it open . " We thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . " Um , thank you . " I stripped off my coat and shirt and washed myself thoroughly . Then I took off my pants and scrubbed myself down to remove any bugs that might be hiding . I shook out my clothes and was dressing when the door opened . " Mr. McNary ? " " Okay . " The interrogation room had the word INTERVIEW painted on the door . I sat on one side of the table . On the other side were Taliafero , an army major with no name tag , and a civilian in a light blue suit that just screamed CIA . The room was not air conditioned and the major and the civilian were sweating . There were two microphones , a ceiling camera , and an extra chair on my side of the table . For legal counsel ? Somehow I did n't think so . Taliafero poured four glasses of water from a plastic pitcher and we each drank : an almost ritual act . " Mr. McNary , " the major began . " Do you know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , but I kept it to myself . he did n't seem like the humorous type . I shook my head . " Not really , no . " " Do you know that Baghdad is in flames ? " " How could I ? I 've been in jail . " " Mr. McNary , why are you in Iraq ? " " I told you - " The major raised his hand . " You told others . We want to hear it from you . " " I did n't do anything . " " I do n't believe you did , " the major began , but the civilian leaned across the table . " Look , pal . If we do n't get the truth and the whole truth from you in one quick hurry , we can march you up to the courtyard and shoot you or do any other damned thing we want . Do you get me ? " " God bless America , " I said , too tired to put up with it . At that moment I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this alive and I was n't willing to waste words talking to this man . " I want to speak to the American civilian authorities . I want to call my family . " " When we finish . " There was a sudden shudder , as if the building we were in was sitting on a rug that someone shifted . A sprinkle of fine dust sifted down . The three looked at each other . " It 's getting closer , " the major said . " What is ? " I asked . A look passed between them , like they were surprised that I did not know . " Never mind , " said the major . " We want to know why you came to Iraq . Start from the beginning . be thorough . Your life is depending on it . " " All our lives , " said Taliafero. he looked serious . I nodded , and I began my story . I was living in Los Angeles and doing just fine , thank you very much , with no more interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a reporter , working for INS as a stringer , writing oddball stories about the entertainment industry , which takes in a lot in California , especially since our fickle electorate had recalled the governor and replaced him with a muscleheaded actor . The state is a prime source of misgovernment , mismanagement , and news stories that read like a season on the old Twilight Zone . Bad for the state , but good for me . I have to say that I was a little uneasy about it . I used to cover front page stuff : wars , murders , politics , even religion and economics . Then I began stumbling over and filing odd stories , and my credibility started to shift . Oh , nothing overt . It was a case of , " this is a weird story , I 'll bet Dave can get to the bottom of it . " And I usually did . Soon I was getting nothing else , no matter how hard I tried to get an assignment for Afghanistan or Chechnya . My girlfriend was more philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then Ray Ramirez tossed my life into the shitter . I WAS FINISHING a story on the new Jack Rackham action film , about massive cost overruns and lax safety procedures , brought to light when a stunt actor died in an explosion . I had some good contacts in the stunt community , had gotten solid leads , and was Grafting my conclusions when Ray Ramirez tapped on my office door . It was already open so I could n't just pretend I was out . Ray was the last person I wanted to deal with . he always borrowed money and my disposable income for this month was already disposed of - plus , I needed to get this piece done . " Hi , Ray . I 'd ask you in but I 'm already on a deadline .... " " That 's okay , bro , " he said , pulling up a chair by my desk and sitting down . " Seriously , Ray - " " It 's about the money I owe you . " I looked at him . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surprised me. he counted out six crisp hundred dollar bills , two twenties and a ten , arranged neatly on my desktop . he was smiling . I did n't like it . I was certain that if I picked one of them up , the ink would come off on my fingers . " Ray , you owe me five hundred and fifty dollars - not six-fifty . " " Call it interest , dude . " " Call it square , " I said , taking $550 and pushing a hundred back at him . he shrugged and took the bill . " Suit yourself , Dave , but I do owe ya . " I looked him over . Ray was n't a dirtball , but he was n't much more than a step above it either . The Ray Ramirez I knew wore T-shirts , jeans , and ball caps , but now he was sporting a suit that must have cost at least a grand . he did n't get that in an Atlantic Avenue Goodwill . The shirt was silk with a wide collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramirez . I was certain that something was coming , and it was coming right up my ass . " Call it square , " I said again . " Now , if you do n't mind , I 'm on a deadline here .... " " Kick it . " " Kick it ? Ray , unlike some people , I have a job . " Ray , oblivious to my entreaties , perched himself on the edge of my desk like a fashionable gargoyle . " I have a great story for you , " he said . " Bigger than anything . Bigger than God , man ! " He laughed then , and something about the quality of that laugh sent a chill down my spine . " Ray , what the hell is wrong with you ? " " No , man , I 'm right . I 'm good . But there 's this guy you got ta meet - " " I 'm on deadline - " " I mean , like today . " : " Deadline , Ray . " And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was n't going to get rid of him unless I agreed to hear his pitch ; but not now . " Ray , I get out of here at about seven . I 'll meet you in Pershing Square by the subway , okay ? I 'll give you fifteen minutes . " " Okay , Dave ! " Ray was up and moving out the door , his coattails flapping , a Latino Groucho Marx . " Fifteen minutes , " I shouted , but he was already disappearing into an elevator . I grumbled , put the entire business out of my head , and went back to the story . I turned in the stunt piece with ten minutes to spare and hit the elevator right at seven . It was n't until I was heading for the Pershing Square Metro Station that I remembered I had promised to meet Ray . I looked around and did n't see him in the mercury vapor streetlights . Maybe he 'd given up . I hustled for the stairs , hopeful of getting home early , perhaps taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a little midnight - " Dave . " Ray Ramirez had materialized under a streetlight by the escalator , looking almost respectable in a camel 's hair topcoat : or at least semi-respectable , as the coat was slightly large on him . he was still low rent , whether you dressed him in the Romanov jewels . he was still Ray Ramirez . And true to being Ray Ramirez , he grabbed my arm like an old friend . Like I was happy to see him . " Dave , even if you a white man , you still my bro ' . " " Ray , I 've always wondered something . " " What , bro ' ? " " You 're not Mexican , you 're Puerto Rican . Your father was the San juan distributor for Coca - Cola till they bumped him upstairs . You grew up in Atlanta , in an upper middle class neighborhood with good schools , so why do you affect that Tijuana trash accent ? " " Hey , I 'm just being one with my peeps , Dave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , Ray ? Do they pay you not to go home ? " Ray looked at me with great disappointment . " That 's cold , man , " he said , and suddenly I felt as if I had gone too far but , not yet willing to apologize , I brought him back to the subject . " Okay , Ray . What 's the big story ? " He smiled thinly , only slightly mollified . " I got a guy I want you to meet . He 'll tell you . " " What guy ? " " The Duke . " " What Duke ? John Wayne is dead , Ray . " " John Wayne was a pussy , Dave . This guy is The Duke . " I was beginning to feel lightheaded . My chances of getting to Kuishimbo were beginning to recede . I cheerfully lost my temper . " Damnit , Ray . If you do n't start making sense I 'm going to throw you down that damned escalator ! " Several people looked at us , but Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced to the left and right to make sure we were n't being overheard or watched , then passed it to me . It was a thick-papered photograph of a handsome , craggy-faced man in a fedora and trenchcoat . " Shit , Ray . This is Jack Rackham . What the hell - " " Just watch the picture , Dave . " " Watch the picture ? " I looked at it and , as I did , it began to change . The clothing disappeared , the features of Jack Rackham began to morph , and his skin became bright red . A second pair of eyes opened , above his normal pair . Then he opened his mouth and flames shot out . It was very impressive and I drew the obvious conclusion . " This is some kind of electronic gizmo , right ? It 's a trick . " Ray took back the photo and held it up . As I watched , the creature transformed back into Jack Rackham , just like those little flip pictures that used to come in cereal boxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is it - a promo for another film ? Jack Rackham 's got all the publicity people he needs and I just finished a piece on his new film , Goering 's Gold . There 's - " " There 's no Jack Rackham , Dave . There 's only The Duke . How much you know about Jack Rackham ? His first movie was what , four years ago ? " " Yeah , " I said . " just about . he sort of came out of nowhere , got discovered , and then did Topsy Turvy with Angelina Jolie . " " Nowhere is right , Dave . he ai n't no actor , he 's a freakin " god ! " " A god . " " From Baby - Ionia or someplace . he tole me but I did n't get it . he goes as Jack Rackham because he loves L.A. - loves it here , does the whole movie star thing . He 's been here for five years . " Five years was about right . Rackham was new , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had grown up in a fishing port on the Gulf . Or was it a ranch in Idaho ? " You know Jack Rackham ? " " He came into Hector 's and bought this old necklace . just walked in and asked for it . But it was n't even on display . Hector had it in the vault , the big safe , you know - " " So he must 've - " " No , Dave . Hector had just got it . Did n't tell nobody , not even me . We 're standing in there , three nights ago , drinking Cuervo and playing backgammon . Then the door opens and in comes Jack Rackham . " " Yeah , " I said , not sure where this was going but , Jack Rackham anything about Jack Rackham , was a story . And if I could get him talking about Goering 's Gold - " just like that . The door was locked , the alarm was on , and he just walked through , like it was n't there . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store when Hector locked up , " Ray cried , frustrated that I was n't reading his mind . " We heard the jingle bell , saw him come in the door and walk right up to Hector . " The omelet , please , " he says . " " Omelet . You mean amulet ? " " Yeah , that 's it . And just like that , Hector goes and gets it . And the Duke hands Hector one hundred one hundred dollar bills and walks out . " " Ten thousand dollars ? " I asked incredulously . Ray smiled . " Now you interested ? " " Now I want to see Hector . " We took a cab to Hector 's Antiques , a slightly upscale pawn shop near Fairfax and Sixth . Ray , satisfied that I was finally paying attention , sat back , beamed at the passing lights , and whistled a soft , off-key rendition of " Light My Fire . " Later , I would remember his choice of music . Hector Blankenship did not seem surprised to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , huh ? " " Ten thousand dollars , Hector ? " " You got a big mouth , Ray , " Hector growled . " One of these days I 'm gon na put my foot in it . " Hector is a huge black man who once played Big Ten Fullback and looks fully capable of making good on a threat . Ray shrugged but kept prudently out of Hector 's reach . " It 's all right , Hector , " I said . " I wo n't tell the 1RS . So what 's with the amulet ? " Hector shrugged . " It came in the mail four days ago , from Hartford . The day before this guy , whoever he is , walked in here . I got a broker out there who keeps an eye out for bargains , you know , and with the present unpleasantness in Iraq and Afghanistan .... " he smiled faintly . " It 's not like I 'm collecting anything illegal . Not too illegal . No antiquities , just coins . " Hector had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for ancient money . he had dozens of coins : round and rectangular , triangular and square ; mint and clipped , each authenticated and none newer than the fall of Rome . I knew little about coins , but after making a few discreet inquiries , I estimated that Hector 's collection was worth at least $30,000 . " But an amulet worth ten thousand dollars , Hector ? " " Tell me , " Hector said . " I paid just under two thousand dollars for it . Do n't even know why I bought it . It 's not a coin , but when my friend described it , I just had to buy it . " " If he knows you just collect coins , why 'd he tell you about this amulet ? " " I du n no , Dave . he felt compelled to tell me about it . I felt compelled to buy it . " " For two thousand dollars . " " Yeah . " " And sell it . " " Yeah . " " For ten thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of old coins , Dave . " " I did n't know Jack Rackham was interested in antiquities . " " Who ? " So I explained to Hector , who has no interest in Hollywood and even less in the movies , just who Jack Rackham was . Hector was nonplussed . " So , why 's he want that thing ? " " Maybe he was compelled , Hector . Maybe it 's magic . " Hector looked like he did n't care much for magic so I tried to change the subject . " Who is this Duke that Ray was babbling about ? " Hector glanced at Ray , who was trying to look down the throat of a stuffed bear , and shook his head . " This gets weirder , Dave . It 's not Duke , it 's Mar-Duke . M-A-R-D-U-K . I looked it up . Marduk was the patron god of the city of Babylon. he was very powerful and was some sort of protector . he had four eyes , red skin , and breathed fire . " I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . Jack Rackham , Marduk , magic amulets . What the hell had Ray and Hector gotten into ? And me , for that matter ? Who the hell was Jack Rackham ? I decided to catch the first train back to the Valley and put the entire business behind me , but first we had to get Ray 's hand out of the bear 's mouth . IHAD THE CAB drop me at the Hollywood and Highland Metro Station . Ray could make his way back from there . Marduk had apparently given him $2,000 : some sort of finder 's fee , plenty enough to get a cab . We rode for a while in silence . Finally , I voiced what was bothering me . " So , I understand that the guy in Hartford felt compelled to send the amulet to Hector , who felt compelled to sell it to Rackham - " . " The Duke . " " Marduk , yeah . But why did you tell me ? " " He told me to . " " Marduk ? " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I remembered that as I rode the subway back to the Valley . As soon as I surfaced in North Hollywood I called Jan , but she coldly informed me that she had already eaten and that she was going to bed . So I dragged my ass back to my apartment where I found Jack Rackham sitting in my favorite chair , my cat on his lap - waiting for me . " Mr. McNary . " " Mr ... Rackham ? " " Close enough . Go on , make yourself comfortable . " Nice of him , I thought , seeing as how it was my home . I got a ginger ale from the fridge , then sat down across from him . Not once did I take my eyes off my guest . It 's not often you get to see a god or a movie star sitting in your favorite chair , and I had both . As I sat , my cat Trolley jumped down and moved to my lap . That at least was comforting . " You 're wondering why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh .... " " Jack is fine . I want to do something for you , Dave , and I want you to do something for me . " His smile was compelling , hypnotic . Of course it was . I looked down at Trolley slumbering in my lap . It seemed to clear my head but , " Ummmm , " was all I could say . " Dave ? " I looked up . he appeared concerned , the concern of an old friend . Of course , he was a god . he could appear to be anything : attractive , imposing , convincing . Or he could crush me like an insect . I felt a sudden surge of anger . " Forgive me , Jack , but I do n't like being toyed with . You seem to be manipulating a lot of people . I think that someone needs to ask why . " Jack Rackham Marduk God of Babylon nodded , looking very human , even a bit exasperated . Finally he reached down , picked up a water bottle I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his knees . " What do you suppose a god is , Dave ? " " Well , " I said , " a creature grounded in the supernatural . " " Go on . " " A member of a race or species of beings who obey different physical laws than the rest of us ; who manipulate us for their own amusement or gain - " Jack laughed softly . " That 's the second time you 've used the word " manipulate . " Considering that you are constantly being manipulated by editors , publishers , critics , and accountants , I ca n't see why you 'd be so touchy . " I took a long pull on my ginger ale and remembered once again why I had given up drinking . " Yes , " I said slowly , choosing my words with care , " but those are other humans , fallible and mortal . They rise and fall . Gods supposedly do n't . " " You never heard of Lucifer ? " I laughed . " You 're right , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . All the best artists use them as models , and their names enter the language as adjectives . Promethean , Pyrrhic , Dionysian . We fall in our millions and are marked only as history . If you are a god , Jack , I guess it makes me a bit nervous to be talking to a whole other food chain . Like a pawn in chess who can understand the king but not the hand that moves him . " Rackham smiled . " Bravo , Dave . Very expressive , if a bit scattered . But let me be so bold as to say that I do n't think you believe that I am a god . " I said nothing for a moment , then , " This is where I ask you to prove it , right ? " " If you like . " " Is there a lot of damage involved ? " Jack smiled . " No , it 's all visual , and your vital signs are strong . You can handle it . " " Well , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight answer to anything from a god . " Show me . " Jack smiled and held up a finger . My eyes were automatically drawn to it " Dave . Come on , Dave , open your eyes . " I did , and a drop of cold water ran down my forehead and into my left eye . As I sat up , a wet compress fell into my lap . Trolley was looking concerned . Jack helped me back to my chair . " Did you get it ? " " I got it , " I said , accepting a drink from Jack 's water bottle . The cool liquid went through me like a draught of mead , steadying my nerves and clearing my head . " Wow . " " Better ? " " Yeah , what is that stuff ? " " A variant of Ambrosia , the water of life . You wo n't get sick from anything for at least a year . " " Really ? " I looked at Trolley . " Give some to my cat . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured her cancer . " " Cancer ? She has cancer ? " " Not anymore . " he smiled and stroked Trolley 's shiny black and white coat . " I 've always been a sucker for animals , Dave . " " Me too , " I said , starting to like this man - god - in spite of myself . " But look , if you can find , get , make stuff like this - " " Why do n't I cure the ills of mankind ? It 's not that simple , and you would n't like it if we did . " " I guess so , " I said , because I had a full memory of everything that had rushed through my head while I was out , which mostly consisted of a crash course in the history of another species , with the emphasis on Marduk . It was a lot to take in . " You were the God of ancient Babylon ? " " Yes . " " And other cities . " " Over the centuries , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Antioch , Rome , Constantinople and Byzantium , Peking , Florence , Genoa , Milan , Paris , Berlin , New York , San Francisco , Tokyo , London . And others . " " And five years ago you came out here from New York . " " Yes . " " Why ? " " Nine-eleven . " " Oh . " " Yes , something just seemed to go out of the city and it was time to move on . " " And what do we do for each other ? " I asked . Things were so far beyond me at this point that I was just riding with it , taking it in . Jack stretched in my beat - up easy chair , his feet on an old hassock I 'd been meaning to throw out . Trolley bounced around on the floor , pursuing a catnip toy she had n't looked at in weeks . Jack sighed , a completely human sound . " Well , I know that you would love to get a really big story .... " I laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dave . A bigger story . Would you like to go to Baghdad and cover the biggest story of all time ? " I said nothing . The war in Iraq was not anywhere near the biggest story of all time , but I nodded dumbly . Then Jack began to explain . It took a while and when he was done , I agreed . At that point I got really sleepy . I do n't remember Jack leaving , or me going to bed , but I woke up eight hours later feeling refreshed , with a very healthy cat on my chest . I was trying to sort it out as I rode the subway to work , my mind buzzing . As I came up into Pershing Square my cell phone went off . " Dave . " " Jack ? " " How are you ? " I stopped in the brilliant sunlight and looked around . A cool breeze was blowing . " I feel great . " " Look in your pocket . " I did . I knew immediately what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " " Hang on to it . Do n't lose it . I need your help , Dave . " My goodness , I thought . My God . A deity needed my help . I had the urge to call Jan and tell her what she 'd missed last night by being impatient , but I did n't . As I hit the newsroom , my boss , Peter , called me into his office . " McNary . Nice take on the Rackham story . " " Uh , thanks . " " You think we 'll get a reaction from Rackham ? Think he 'll be pissed ? " No , I thought , but I said something reassuring and noncommittal . Peter was shuffling papers and then he looked up . " You want a few weeks in Iraq ? " " Pardon me ? " My blood was running cold at that point . I fingered the amulet in my pocket . Peter handed me a sheet of paper . " We need a three - part story on antiquities . all the big sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marduk ? " I said . " Who ? " " Nevermind . " " It 's a real plum , McNary , " Peter said . " Will you do it ? " I nodded . " Y-yeah , sure . " " You fly out at three tomorrow . " I ran around like a madman getting ready , convincing Jan ( " So , you finally got a foreign job . Guess I wo n't have to worry about you being late for dinner for a few weeks . " ) to take care of Trolley and tying up loose ends . Next morning I called a cab and I was n't even surprised when the driver turned out to be Jack . " You 're sure I can do this , " I said . " I know your life history , Dave . You 're the best man for this . You can do it . It 's simple . You carry this amulet to Babylon . Memorize this map . " He passed across a sheet of parchment with block symbols and a dotted line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget it . " How come you just do n't do this ? Fly over and put it there yourself . " " Not all gods can fly , Dave . " " I meant on a plane . " We swung onto the 101 and headed west into midday traffic . " Well , for one thing , I could n't get a visa . If I tried , the studio 's lawyers would scream blue murder . And , there are things about my body chemistry that set off metal detectors . Besides , if I tried to come in openly and she was awake , the plane would be vaporized before we could land . She ca n't know that I 'm coming . " " You mean T- " " No names , Dave . Do n't ever mention her name . She 'll hear you . just place the amulet and I 'll do the rest . " I thought about this for a while . One other question was bothering me . " Why ? " " Why am I going back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because she 's already there , " Jack said as he guided his cab around a slow - moving truck . " She 's waiting , buried deep in the Earth . She 'll awaken soon whether I 'm there or not . It 's the war . The explosions . She 's heard the war . " I THOUGHT ABOUT that conversation all the way to Iraq . When we 'd pulled up to the curb at LAX , I 'd gotten out , put my bags on the sidewalk , and turned back to say good-bye , but the cab was empty , sitting with its engine idling . I 'd hurried away before the police came to examine it . I flew through Frankfurt and Vienna and changed in Riyadh . No civilian flights were going to Iraq at the moment , so , after wrangling with the authorities , I managed to ride the jumpseat on a plane taking Iowa National Guard replacements to Baghdad . No one called it a peace or a pacification or a reconstruction anymore . Coalition casualties had just topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare , a tar baby of epic proportions . I checked through customs without a ripple and found the cab driver who handled INS reporters . For a moment I thought it might be Jack , but I had him in my pocket . As we were leaving the airport , the cab rumbled and bounced on its springs . " Was that an earthquake ? " " Four this week , " said the driver . " Getting worse . Why Babylon ? " " I 'm doing a piece on antiquities , " I said , as innocently as I could . He shrugged . " Okay , but the road may not be open . " It was n't . I sat back , sweating in my filthy suit . We 'd gone through four pitchers of water and several quake - sized jolts . My questioners were getting increasingly nervous . I felt strangely placid . I thought of Jack and my cat , but I could n't visualize Jan . I guessed that relationship was over . If I did n't get home I hoped that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this time I could hear a nearby explosion . The lights dimmed , then came back up . " Jesus , " said the major . The CIA man scowled and leaned across the table . " If you think we 're going to buy one word of that bullshit - " " Wait a minute , " Taliafero said , putting a restraining hand on the CIA man 's arm . " McNary , you 've been in isolation a week . " " Yeah , so ? " " So , if your story were true you would know what was out there , would n't you ? " he said . I could feel the pure , raw hope in his voice . " I guess so , " I said softly . " I might even be able to help . " Taliafero opened his hand . The amulet was resting in his palm . " Tell me . " " You tell me that it 's not a giant five - headed dragon called Tiamat , " I said . " Okay by me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We started to rise but the CIA man grabbed my coat . " No chance , " he growled . " This man is a suspect for the crimes of espionage , sedition , treason - " He stopped abruptly as Taliafero put the muzzle of a pistol to his ear . " Mr. Brown , no one wants to kill you , but if you interfere we will . " He relieved the CIA man of his weapon and passed me the amulet . Then , as the major held Brown at gunpoint , Captain Taliafero and I ran for the surface . Baghdad was indeed burning , and I could see Tiamat in the midst of it , looking for all the world like something out of a Japanese monster movie . Explosions sparkled around her but she seemed to shake them off . At least one of her heads seemed to be breathing gas or fire at any given moment and her immense bulk was flattening the burning rubble that had been Iraq 's capital city . " She looks tough , " I said as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't dent her with anything conventional , and Staff is n't willing to use a nuke. " he looked at me as the Humvee skidded out of the compound past a trio of burning trucks . " Can Marduk stop this thing ? " " I hope so . " As we raced down the road toward Babylon I became aware that Tiamat seemed to be getting closer , as if our courses were converging . Then I remembered that I had spoken her name in the prison . Had she heard me , or was she reacting to the amulet ? " Can you do anything to slow her down ? " " No , " Taliafero yelled over the engine . " We 're dead air in this thing , but they might . " Six missile-carrying Apaches streaked by overhead , breaking up into three waves of two so as to hit the monster with a triple anvil attack . They were n't successful , but they bought us time . When we finally reached the place marked on Marduk 's map Tiamat was perhaps ten miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marduk , she could n't fly . " This had better work , " Taliafero said , as I placed the amulet and stood back . Amen to that , I thought , as I spoke the words that Jack had taught me . Nothing happened . The amulet just lay there . " Are you sure you got it right ? " I was about to pronounce the incantation again when I felt a presence behind me . I turned to find Jack standing there . " Am I glad to see you ! " I cried . Jack smiled . " We only have a moment . I wanted to thank you , Dave . I could n't have done it without you . " he glanced at Tiamat , approaching inexorably from the city . " It 's time , Dave . Major Taliafero , you and your men had better get under cover . " And then he began to change . He started to coruscate with electrical charges , lightning flashing and discharging into the ground . As his clothing disappeared , his body was bathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunkered down behind the ancient stones of Babylon as primal forces cascaded through him . Then he began to grow and his features blurred and softened while his eyes became brighter and more prominent . The second set opened above the first . His mouth gaped wide to speak but only a roaring sound and fire poured forth . I heard the Rangers gasp and scramble back . Marduk was now twenty feet tall and still growing . he raised his hand and bright plasmic energy poured off it . " Hang on , " I cried . " It 's going to get very windy . " As Marduk grew larger , winds from all points of the compass converged on him , swirling and circling above his upraised hand , their zephyrs alive with colors and noise . Sand and even rocks became airborne as Tiamat drew closer , thundering and trumpeting , shooting incandescent gas and fire into the air . The glowing winds began forming a grid in the air above Marduk . " His net , " I screamed over the din . " The net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall as Tiamat and as he turned to the attack , three of Tiamat 's heads fired at once , a wild prismatic spray of flames , and Marduk disappeared in the firestorm . Somehow I knew he would be unharmed and when the fire subsided he had snared two of the heads in his glowing net . Larger and broader they grew , the glowing energy and shooting flames lighting up the desert as bright as day . I 'm told that they saw it in Mosul and Basra ; the output of two battling gods cracking the very fabric of night . And just when it seemed as if there would be no top end of the fury , it all vanished . We were deafened but we were alive . In the distance Baghdad burned ; but we were alive . Baghdad was destroyed , but the war was over . No one wanted to fight over anything after that . A month later , Coalition troops began leaving for home . My exclusive story ran everywhere with many of the photos that had been taken by soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took three months to die down , Hector went back to his coins , and Ray Ramirez vanished back into his life . One night after speaking to the L.A , Press Club on the topic of " Conversations with a God , " I sat in my favorite chair with Trolley on my lap , going over the mail I 'd been neglecting . In among the flyers and bills and circulars and offers was a quaint black and white postcard , circa 1930 , with a view of the Shanghai waterfront . But the stamp was modern and I had been expecting the message . It was simple . " Having a wonderful time . Thanks , Jack . " - For Shelley Martin
