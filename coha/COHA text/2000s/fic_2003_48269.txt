Two bow hunters were heading out of the woods after another day without bringing back a deer , when , at a puddle in a logging road rut , tangled in some branches above it , dangling down , they spied one of those red and white fishing bobbers . " What the hell ? " the first bow hunter said , but concerned that they were losing light fast , kept on following the logging road out , grumbling , as he went , about any man fool enough to think he could catch a fish in a puddle . The second hunter remained . Although no hook is visible , the bobber surely caught us , caught our attention was his first thought . And then , that the dangling bobber had kept time in an unoccupied way till now . Now it kept time in an occupying way . The two men had set it off . Speaking of time , if there was any sprung mechanism it was the gray squirrels looping out like mad to find and strip the pine cones of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun looked as if dissolving in a glass of milky water . " I , for one , am big on pictures of storage , " said the hunter . " Eternity , I can never get enough . " Someone much bigger , much more occupied , stirred the sun in the water with his finger , and distracted by a human voice left it swirling , swirling ... The hunter peered down at the puddle as if he were that god peering down on the earth . So many of the stripped pine cones in the logging road had been run over and looked like flattened squirrel tails . " No wonder they run around like mad , " that god said . " Who can sit still in a world where one is constantly reminded of horrible fates , so many by their own hands ? " On the faces of the other gods there was concern , but the talk quickly shifted to summer , and going to that same puddle-when it was dry and dusty-to watch the goldfinches bathe . " Mortals , " another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes them brighter . " And they all had a hearty laugh . When the second hunter finally made it back to the truck , his disappointed buddy started in on him again . " I just ca n't believe you . There it stood , five feet in front of you . Why did n't you kill it ? " <p>
