Two minutes . That 's how long it took me to realize I had made a big mistake . The blue team was good . They were big . They were fast . They knew how to play hockey . From the moment the puck was dropped to the ice , they controlled the game . They moved the puck back and forth between them like a pinball , across the blue line , into the corner , back to the point . Once they were in the zone they settled down , took their time with it , waited for the best opportunity . They were like five wolves circling their prey . When the shot came it was nothing more than a dark blur . The center slid across the front of the goal mouth , untouched , taking the puck and with one smooth motion turning it home with a sudden flick of the wrist . It hit the back of the net before the goalie even knew it was coming . Right between his legs . Or as they say on television , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long night for the goalie on the red team . Which I would n't have minded so much if that goalie had n't been a certain forty-eight-year-old idiot who let himself get talked into it . " It 's a thirty-and-over league , " Vinnie had said . " Every Thursday night . No checking , no slapshots . They call it slow puck . ' You know , like slow pitch ' softball ? Slow puck ' hockey , you get it ? " " I get it , " I said . " It 's a lot of fun , Alex . You 'll love it . " Vinnie was my Indian friend . Vinnie LeBlanc , an Ojibwa , a member of the Bay Mills tribe , with a little bit of French Canadian in him , a little bit of Italian , and a little bit of God knows what else , likemost of the Indians around here . You could n't see much Indian blood in him , just a hint of it in the face , around the eyes and cheekbones . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and careful way of speaking . And unlike some of the Indians I 've met , especially the tribes in Canada , he looked you right in the eye when he spoke to you . Vinnie was an Ojibwa and proud of it . But he did n't live on the reservation anymore . He never drank . Not one drop , ever . He could put on a suit and pass for a downstate businessman . Or he could track a deer through the woods like he knew the inside of that animal 's mind . He had found me at the Glasgow Inn , sitting by the fireplace . I should have known something was up when he bought me a beer . " I do n't think so , Vinnie . I have n't been on skates in thirty years . " " How much you got ta skate ? " he said . " You 'll be in goal . C'm on , Alex , we really need ya . " " What happened to your regular goalie ? " " Ah , he has to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He sort of took one in the neck . " " I thought you said it was slow puck ! " " It was a fluke thing , Alex . It caught him right under the mask . " " Forget it , Vinnie . I 'm not playing goalie . " " You were a catcher , right ? " he said . " In double-A ? " " I played two years in triple-A , " I said . " But so what ? " " It 's the same thing . You wear pads . You wear a mask . You just catch a puck instead of a baseball . " " It 's not the same thing . " " Alex , the Red Sky Raiders need you . You ca n't let us down . " I almost spit out my beer . " Red Sky Raiders ? Are you kidding me ? " " It 's a great name , " he said . " Sounds like a kamikaze squadron . " Red Sky was Vinnie 's Ojibwa name . During hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking downstaters into the woods . He liked to use his nickname then , playing up the Indian thing . After all , he once told me , who are you going to hire to be your guide , a guy named Red Sky or a guy named Vinnie ? " Alex , Alex . " He shook his head and looked into the fire . Here it comes , I thought . " It 's just a fun little hockey league . Something to look forward to on a Thursday night . You know , instead of sitting around looking at the snow and going fucking insane . " " I thought you Indians were at peace with the seasons . " He gave me a look . " I got eight guys on my team . They 're going to be very disappointed . We 'll have to forfeit the game . All because a former professional athlete is afraid to put on some pads and play goal for us . You gon na just sit here on your butt all winter ? Do n't you ever get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body again ? " " You 're breaking my heart , Vinnie . You really are . " " You can use Bradley 's stuff . It 's all new . Mask , blocker , glove , skates . What size do you wear ? " " Eleven , " I said . " Perfect . " I did n't have much chance after that . Vinnie had been there when I needed him , taking care of the cabins while I was out making a fool of myself pretending to be a private investigator . So I certainly owed him one . And he was right , I was tired of siting around all winter . How bad could it be , right ? Put on the pads and the mask , play some goal . It might even be fun . It was fun all right . I flicked the puck out of the goal to the referee and he skated it back to center ice for another face-off . I barely had time to take a drink of water from my bottle when they were back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking for another shot . The blue center was skating around in front of my goal like he owned it . I had to keep peeking around him to follow the puck . " Get this guy out of here , " I said to anyone who could hear me . " Do n't let him just stand here . " A long shot came from the blue line . I knocked the puck down , but before I could dive on it , the blue center knocked it into the net . Three minutes into the game , and I had given up two goals . The center did a little dance , waved his stick in the air , his teammates jumping all over him like they just won the Stanley Cup . Vinnie skated by . " Hang in there , Alex , " he said . " We 'll try to give you a little more help . " I grabbed the front of his red jersey . " Vinnie , for God 's sake , will you hit that guy or something ? He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no checking , remember ? Alex , we 're just playing for fun here . " " I 'm not having any fun , " I said . " You do n't have to take his head off , just ... give him a little bump . " The blue center was skating around in wide circles now , bobbing his head . He was chanting to himself , something like , " Oh yeah , baby , oh yeah , oh yeah , oh baby , oh yeah . " I knew the type . It does n't matter what sport you play , you always run into guys like this . In baseball , it was usually a first baseman or an outfielder . They came up to the plate with that swagger in their step . I 'd ask them how they 're doing as they 're digging in , just because that 's what you do in baseball , but they 'd ignore me . First pitch is a strike , they look back at the umpire with that look . How dare you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the pitcher and then give him the sign for a high hard one . Guys like that need the fear of God put in them every once in a while , something to remind them that they 're human just like the rest of us . If not a bolt of lightning then at least a good ninety-mile-per-hour fastball under their chin . It was reassuring to see that hockey players had to deal with these guys , too . Vinnie smiled at me , took off a glove and adjusted his helmet strap . " Maybe just one little bump , " he said . I knew they played three ten-minute periods in this league , a concession to age and to the fact that most teams only had nine or ten players . So I only had twenty-seven more minutes to go . I slapped my stick on the ice . Go Red Sky Raiders . Vinnie 's men finally woke up and started playing some hockey . While the puck was in the opposite zone , I stood all alone in front of my goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-new , built by the Sault tribe with money from the casino . There was a second rink on the other side , locker rooms in the middle , and a restaurant on the upper deck . The stands were mostly empty , just some women watching us . None of them looked like they were on our side . I pulled the mask away from my face , wiped away the sweat . The catcher 's gear I wore a million years agothe chest protector and the shin padswas nothing compared to these goalie pads . It felt like I had a mattress tied to each leg . The game started to get a little " chippy , " as the hockey announcers like to say . The elbows were coming up in the corners , the sticks were hitting other sticks , maybe even a leg or two . There was only one referee , a little old guy skating around with a whistle in his hand , never daring to blow it . He was probably retired from a civil service job , never got in anybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I finally stopped a couple shots . It was n't like catching a baseball at all , I realized . A pitch in the dirt , you become a human wall . The glove goes down between your legs . You do n't even try to catch it . You let it bounce off you , you throw the mask off , and then you pick it up . A hockey goalie can be more aggressive , move out of the net , cut off the angle . " Att'sa way , Alex , " Vinnie said . He was breathing hard . He bounced his stick off my pads . " Now you 're getting it . " Toward the end of the first period , there was a loose puck in front of the net . I dove on it . The blue center came at me hard , stopping right in front of me . He cut his skates into the ice , sending a full spray right into my face . The old shower trick . I had seen it on television a thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I got up I stuck my stick into the hollow behind his knee . He turned around and cross-checked me . Two hands on his stick and wham , right across my shoulders . I looked into his eyes . A cold blue . Pupils dilated , as wide as pennies . My God , I thought , this guy is either stone crazy or high . Or both . The referee skated between us . " Easy does it , boys , " he said . " None of that . " " Hey , ref , " I said . " That metal thing in your hand , when you blow in it , it makes the little pea vibrate and a loud sound comes out . You should try it . And then you can send this clown to the penalty box for two minutes . " " Let 's just play some hockey , boys , " he said , skating off with the puck . The center kept looking at me . Those crazy eyes . I took my mask off . " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Sorry , did n't realize you were an old man . I 'll try to take it easy on you . " When the first period was over , we all got to sit on the bench and wipe our faces off for a few minutes . Nobody said anything . We could hear the other team on their bench , laughing , yelling at each other . Just a little too loud , I thought . A little too happy . Then they started making these noises . It sounded like that stupid chant you hear them do down in Atlanta at the Braves games . The Indian war chant . Vinnie stood up and looked at them over the partition . Then he looked at us . Eight faces , all Bay Mills Ojibwa . And one old white man . Nobody said a word . They did n't have to . Here it comes , I thought . I 've seen this look before , I 've never met an Ojibwa who was n't a gentle person at heart , who did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave that fuse enough time to burn , watch out . You see it in the casinos every couple months . Some drunken white man makes a scene , starts yelling at the pit boss about how the no-good Indian dealer is cheating him . Does n't even realize that the pit boss himself is a member of the tribe . If he pushes it far enough he goes right through a window . I felt a little looser in the second period , watching my Red Sky Raiders take it to the blue team . Vinnie was right about one thingit felt good to use my body again . For something other than cutting wood or shoveling snow , anyway . If this was a mistake , it certainly was n't a big one . It would n't rank up there with the other major mistakes of my life . Like getting married when I was twenty-three years old , just out of baseball , not sure what I was going to do with my life . Not a good reason to get married . Or letting myself get talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . Or Sylvia . Letting myself fall in love with her . Yes , I 'll say it . The puck is in the other end . I 'm skating back and forth in front of my net , wondering why I 'm thinking of these things . But yes , I 'll say it . I loved her . " I 've been hiding up here , " she told me . " I 've been hiding from the world . I think you are , too , whether you admit it or not . " And then she left . Just like that . " I hope I 've touched your life . " The last thing she said to me . What a melodramatic college-girl thing to say . I hope I 've touched your life . Yeah , Sylvia . You touched my life . You touched my life the same way a tornado touches a trailer park . The puck coming this way . The blue center behind it . The sound of his skates in the empty arena . Snick snick snick snick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time like this . It used to happen in baseball . I 'd be settling under a pop fly and I 'd think of something else in my life with a sudden clarity like it was the first time I 'd ever thought of it . Like my biggest mistake of all . A madman 's apartment in Detroit . Aluminum foil on the walls . My partner and I frozen with fear , watching the gun in his hand . Snick snick snick snick . Sylvia . I am in her bed and she is looking down at me . We have just finished making love in the bed she shares every night with her husband . He is my friend , but I do n't care . She owns me . The skater is fast . He 's the best player on the ice , probably the best player this little Thursday night hockey league will ever see . He looks up at me . A peek over his shoulder . The other players are far behind . Time slows down . It 's something every athlete knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . I did n't pull my gun in time . I waited too long . I am shot and my partner is shot and we are both on the ground . There is so much blood . It all comes back to me . Not as urgently as it once did . I do n't dream about it much anymore . I do n't need the pills to make it through the nights . But it still comes back . I am lying on the floor and my partner is next to me . I come out of the net to cut off the angle . He shoots . No ! It 's a fake . He pulls the puck back . I can feel myself falling backward . He 's going to skate right around me and slip the puck into the open net . Unless I can knock the puck away . My only chance . I jab at it with my stick as I fall . I hit the puck and my stick goes between his legs . He trips and slides face first into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ice . I take off my gloves , my mask . He throws a punch at me and misses . I grab him by the jersey and we dance the hockey fight dance . You ca n't find any leverage to throw a good punch when you 're on skates . You just hold on and try to pull the other guy 's shirt over his head . It 's a funny thing to watch when you 're not one of the guys dancing . The man 's eyes were wide with bloodlust and whatever the hell chemicals he was flying on . " Take it easy , " I said . " I 'm sorry . " " The fuck you 're sorry , " he said . Spit and sweat hitting me in the face . All around us the other players in the same dance , every man picking his own partner according to how much they really felt like fighting . The old referee was skating around us , blowing his whistle . I guess he finally remembered how it works . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just calm down . " " Fucking Indians , " he said . " I 'm not an Indian , " I said . " Yeah , fuck that , " he said . " I know , you 're a Native fucking American . " I started laughing . I could n't help it . " What 's so funny ? " he said . " Did I say something funny ? " " You always get high when you play hockey ? " I said . " The fuck you talking about ? " " You 're higher than the space shuttle , " I said . " If I were still a cop I 'd have to arrest you . Skating while impaired . " He gave me a good push and skated away . The dance was over . " Fucking Indians , " he said . We finished the game . Vinnie scored once in that period . Another of his teammates scored in the third period to tie the game at 2-2 . I made a couple nice saves to keep us tied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend the blue center had an open shot at me . He wound up and launched a rocket . No slapshots , my ass . I got a glove on it , knocked it just high enough to hit the crossbar with a loud ringing sound that reverberated through the entire arena . The game ended . There would be no overtime . The next game was ready to start , as soon as they got us out of there and gave the Zamboni a chance to take a quick run over the ice . He glared at me , breathing hard . I look back on that moment now , the two of us facing each other on the ice . I wonder what I would have done if I had known what would happen in the next few days . I probably would have hit him in the face with my hockey stick . Or broken off the end and jabbed him in the neck . But of course , I had no way of knowing . At that moment , he was just another hotshot asshole hockey player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away his third goal . " No hat trick today , " I said to him . " Looks like the Cowboys and Indians have to settle for a tie . "
