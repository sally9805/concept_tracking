The path from poverty to development has come incredibly fast in the span of human history . Two hundred years ago , the idea that we could potentially achieve the end of poverty would have been unimaginable . Just about everybody was poor with the exception of a very small minority of royals and landed gentry . Life was as difficult in much of Europe as it was in India or China . With very few exceptions , your great-great-grandparents were poor and most likely living on the farm . One leading economic historian , Angus Maddison , puts the average income per person in Western Europe in 1820 at around 90 percent of the average income of sub-Saharan Africa today . Life expectancy in Western Europe and Japan as of 1800 was probably about forty years . // There was little sense a few centuries ago of vast divides in wealth and poverty around the world .

The early Portuguese explorers in Africa were impressed with the well-ordered towns in West Africa . // Until the mid-1700s , the world was remarkably poor by any of today 's standards . Life expectancy was extremely low ; children died in vast numbers in the now rich countries as well as the poor countries . Disease and epidemics , not just the black death of Europe , but many waves of disease , from smallpox and measles to other epidemics , regularly washed through society and killed mass numbers of people . Episodes of hunger and extreme weather and climate fluctuations sent societies crashing . The rise and fall of the Roman Empire , for Arnold Toynbee , was much like the rise and decline of all other civilizations before and since . Economic history had long been one of ups and downs , growth followed by decline , rather than sustained economic progress . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why vast gaps between rich and poor exist today , we need therefore to understand a very recent period of human history during which these vast gaps opened . The past two centuries , since around 1800 , constitute a unique era in economic history , a period that the great economic historian Simon Kuznets famously termed the period of Modern Economic Growth , or MEG for short . Before the era of MEG , indeed for thousands of years , there had been virtually no sustained economic growth in the world and only gradual increases in the human population ... // ( Continues ... ) //
