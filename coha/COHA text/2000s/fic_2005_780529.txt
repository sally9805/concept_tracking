KATIE : ( 7-10 ) A plain-looking 7 year-old girl who is precocious and small for her age . She perceives a lot more than most 7 year-olds and peppers her negligent babysitter with questions .

He about-faces to look at the interior of his home . He will not miss it . He turns to open the screen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen door opens .

RESCUE SQUAD , KITCHEN  --  CONTINUOUS The kitchen is empty except for HEATHER and ALLISON , both about nineteen and dressed in EMS uniforms with " EMS " stitched conspicuously on the back , seated on opposite sides of a wooden table . Heather is dark-haired , about 5 ' 9 " and built like a lingerie model . Allison has blond hair , is several inches shorter than Heather , and although not overweight , she has a softer build than Heather . Heather has take-out PANCAKES and SAUSAGES in front of her , and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine . Allison has a BAGEL and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot on her mind . <p> # HEATHER # Yeah , asshole Jerry . He 's moving to Middletown . He left this morning . <p> # ALLISON # No way .

You 're going with Derek anyway . <p> # HEATHER # Ally , I do n't want to go either , but Derek told Adam he 'd go , and I 'm not going by myself . <p> 3 # ALLISON # I thought Adam was hurt . <p> # HEATHER # I wish . <p> Heather takes a drag of her Cigarette and exhales out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRAD , in jeans with his t-shirt thrown over his shoulder , is standing in front of the door , waiting . MEGAN , in shorts , a t-shirt and a baseball cap , and AMY , in a sunskirt , look on . All in their late teens , they are unmade and worn-out , as if they had n't slept last night . Brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more . Brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door , trying to peer through the shades . Megan passes the time by pulling Jimmy 's MAIL out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door . <p> # BRAD # ( banging on the window pane ) Hey ! Jimmy ! <p> The door opens and JIMMY answers , in his very late teens , about 5 ' 4 " and thin , dressed in boxers , a t-shirt and bedroom slippers . Jimmy 's tired , but Brad 's a friendly face . <p> BRAD ( CONT 'D ) Finally ! <p> # JIMMY # Office hours are nine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of credit card bills in there , Jimmy . <p> # JIMMY # ( holding his hand out for the Mail ) I know . <p> Megan hands Jimmy the Mail . <p> # MEGAN # You 're not mad that we 're stopping by like this ? <p> # JIMMY # It 's no big deal , but let 's hurry up . I got ta go to work . <p> 4 # MEGAN # ( explaining to Amy ) Jimmy 's got like , six jobs . <p> Jimmy stands aside , allowing Megan and Amy into his apartment .

I got work . <p> Brad steps past Jimmy into the apartment , and Jimmy shuts the door after them . EXT . POOL  --  MORNING The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water . PEDRO , an unshowered , pot-bellied Hispanic , about twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts , is standing at the end of the board , looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation . COREY , a late teenager covered with tattoos , with twigs for arms and legs , lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many pool skimmer drains . Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up , down , up , down . Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and , but for his want of grace , the entry would be poetic . Instead , Pedro 's dive is as clumsy as it is painful . <p> # COREY # Nice . <p> # PEDRO # Fuck you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COREY # Maybe back in Mexico that 's a shower , in Athens that 's just dirty . <p> # PEDRO # Clean the pool , conjo , clean the pool . <p> # COREY # At least I 'm paid to be here . <p> Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey , starting to enjoy his morning swim . A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing . Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone . In the background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly . <p> COREY ( CONT 'D ) Wynwood Pool House , Corey speaking . <p> EMILY , the voice on the other end , is hushed and uncertain . <p> EMILY 'S VOICE It 's me . <p> # COREY # Emily ? <p> EMILY 'S VOICE Some other girl would be calling you ? <p> 6 <p> # COREY # How 'd you get this number ? <p> EMILY 'S VOICE Do n't you work there ? <p> # COREY # What do you want ? <p> EMILY 'S VOICE I need you to come pick me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you ? <p> EMILY 'S VOICE At home . <p> # COREY # What for ? <p> EMILY 'S VOICE Just because . I need to stay with you for a couple days . <p> # COREY # Emily , our place is tiny , we got no water . Our phone just got shut off , too . You 'd be miserable like us . What for anyway ? <p> EMILY 'S VOICE It 's no big deal . Just come pick me up . <p> # COREY # Fine , forget it then . <p> EMILY 'S VOICE Corey , come on ! How many times have I called you since you left ? I would n't ask , except I do n't have anywhere to go . Please . <p> # COREY # Fine . Alright , fine . If you wan na stay in our little dump , fine . <p> EMILY 'S VOICE Fine . Thanks , then . <p> INT . JESSICA 'S APARTMENT  --  MORNING JESSICA , about eighteen , wire-thin and plain , yet attractive in an unkept sort of way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couch sleeping . Her chokingly small living room is in a <p> 7 devastating state of disarray , with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction . An ALARM on a table next to the couch begins blaring , and Jessica stretches out her arm to silence it . INT . JESSICA 'S APARTMENT , BATHROOM  --  MOMENTS LATER Jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself , still half asleep . The bathroom is tiny like the living room - pathetic rather than endearing . She puts TOOTHPASTE on her TOOTHBRUSH . INT . JESSICA 'S APARTMENT , LIVING ROOM  --  CONTINUOUS JINA , Jessica 's mother , opens the front door and enters the living room wearing a grocery checkout clerk 's uniform . Jina drops her old , worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway . She opens the bathroom door and enters . INT . JESSICA 'S APARTMENT , BATHROOM  --  CONTINUOUS Jessica is brushing her teeth when Jina enters . <p> # JINA # Are n't you supposed to be watching Katie right now ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabs a bottle of ASPIRIN , and shuts it . Jessica continues brushing as if her mother were not there . <p> JINA ( CONT 'D ) Did you get my message ? <p> Jessica shakes her head in the negative sense . Jina exits the bathroom and Jessica follows , still brushing her teeth . INT . JESSICA 'S APARTMENT , LIVING ROOM  --  CONTINUOUS Jessica walks over to the ANSWERING MACHINE and hits a button . The Answering Machine clicks on as Jessica brushes unenthusiastically . <p> # ANSWERING MACHINE # ( electronic voice ) You have one new message . ( Jina 's voice ) Hi Jess , it 's your mother , calling to say happy birthday , since you 'll be gone when I get home . I 'm driving your sister to school and I 'm leaving the car for her , so I 'll be taking the train back . <p> Jessica starts up as if she 'd been struck . She spins around to an open window near the couch , leans out , and spits out the toothpaste <p> 8 to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour forth from the Answering Machine . <p> ANSWERING MACHINE ( CONT 'D ) By the way , you should call your sister and stop this not-talking nonsense . <p> Jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the Answering Machine . <p> ANSWERING MACHINE ( CONT 'D ) Anyway , I know how you hate long messages , so I 'll see you tomorrow ... <p> Suddenly wide awake , Jessica turns to her mother . <p> # JESSICA # That 's fucking bullshit . <p> # JINA # Here we go again . <p> # JESSICA # What about my car ? ! <p> # JINA # Jessica , your sister got into beauty school , and she 's going . Now I 've got about two hours sleep before I have to drive her all the way the hell up there . <p> # JESSICA # Yeah , I heard that . <p> # JINA # Jess , you 're still living here for free . <p> # JESSICA # On the couch ! <p> # JINA # Jessica , it 's still my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy for your sister ? <p> # JESSICA # Oh yeah , I 'm real happy . She gets my car , and I get shit . Thanks , Jina . Do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy I am for her . <p> # JINA # If you 're going to be like this , I 'm just going to bed . <p> 9 Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water . Jessica returns to the living room wearing a t-shirt that reads " Athens Youth Group " in large letters along the front . Jina is gone . Jessica runs her hand through her hair , tossing it haphazardly . She grabs a pair of large SUNGLASSES off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes . She opens the door and exits the apartment . EXT . RON 'S GYM  --  MORNING Jimmy 's PIECE-OF-SHIT hatchback is parked in front of the small bare-bones gym . INT . RON 'S GYM , LOCKER ROOM  --  CONTINUOUS Jimmy now dressed in worn-out heavily-frayed khaki shorts and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " emblem on the pocket , stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel CHINESE STRESS BALLS with his other hand . He opens the locker and pulls out a large brown LUNCH BAG propped prominently at the base . <p> RON ( O.S. ) Hey Jimmy . You fix the lat machine ? <p> RON , the tall , well-built , forty-something owner of the gym , approaches . Jimmy turns toward Ron .

If you were built like her I 'd keep you . <p> Ron exits and Jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker , defeated . BUGGERIN ' BOBBY BALES , a.k.a . Bobby the Bookie , an enormous juicehead built like an old-school NFL linebacker , naked except for a towel around his neck , having just taken a shower , is leaning against the end of a row of lockers , waiting for his chance at Jimmy . Jimmy would rather that Ron stay . <p> RON ( CONT 'D ) Bales . <p> Bobby nods in response as Ron passes by on his way out . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tender , frighteningly tender , it 's so entirely genuine . Jimmy would prefer a beating - simple and final .

I want to put it on Indy tonight . <p> 11 # BOBBY # I ca n't take any more of your bets . I look like a spineless fucking fag . <p> Bobby shuts Jimmy 's locker and steps up to Jimmy so that Jimmy is now face to face with Bobby 's enormous organ - a terrifying sight for mortal men and reputable women . Jimmy is struck silent , savagely clenching his Chinese Stress Balls as he struggles for thought . <p> BOBBY ( CONT 'D ) What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are talkin ' . <p> # JIMMY # I know they 're talkin ' ! <p> # BOBBY # You do n't know a fuckin ' thing .

The two SWIMMERS left in the pool are climbing out .

Everybody stay out of the pool . <p> The Lifeguard stands and runs off toward the PAYPHONE . <p> # PETE # Alright , well , quit horsing around . The Blandino 's had a break-in .

EMPTY PARK  --  MORNING Though the park is in a poor neighborhood , it is relatively clean . The park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young GIRLS making their way across it . Prominent in the background sits an old run-down yellow CAR that Jessica drove to the park . <p> 13 JESSICA is carrying KATIE , a plain , tiny seven-year-old girl , in piggy-back fashion , with Katie 's legs dangling out in front of Jessica . Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone . <p> # KATIE # Does n't Carlos want his car back ? <p> # JESSICA # He 's letting me borrow it . <p> # KATIE # Well then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # JESSICA # I slept late . <p> # KATIE # Were you drinking last night ? <p> # JESSICA # No .

Katie sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch , Katie 's youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom . INT . AMBULANCE  --  MORNING HEATHER is driving the AMBULANCE , sirens blaring , a CIGARETTE hanging out of her mouth , with ALLISON riding shotgun . HARRY , mild-mannered , rotund , middle-aged and slightly balding , is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance , adjacent to a stretcher . Harry sits expressionless , adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving . <p> # ALLISON # ( pointing ) Turn left at the light . <p> EXT . ROAD  --  CONTINUOUS WIDE on the ambulance tearing through town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this emergency situation , recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass , on her way to running through a red light .

POOL , PARKING LOT  --  CONTINUOUS Within the parking lot , the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool . At the gate stands the LIFEGUARD . <p> 15 All three climb out of the ambulance . Harry rushes toward the Lifeguard . Heather takes a final puff of her Cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same direction as Harry . Allison lags behind , pulling a BACKBOARD and a large FIRST AID KIT out of the ambulance . <p> # LIFEGUARD # She 's in here . <p> They enter the gate . EXT . POOL  --  CONTINUOUS Heather and Harry follow the Lifeguard into the pool area , where several BYSTANDERS have gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

She just passed out , right where you see her . <p> # HARRY # Did you see her eat anything ? <p> # LIFEGUARD # Uh-uh . <p> Heather turns and walks back toward Allison coming through the gate carrying the Backboard and First Aid Kit - she wants a word with Allison .

How ? <p> 16 Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , that slut fucked him . <p> # ALLISON # How do you know ? <p> # HEATHER # She started dating Steve right after we broke up . I mean right after . I asked him if there was another girl , and he never answered . He could n't answer , because he was fucking that slut . <p> # ALLISON # That does n't mean they fucked . <p> Heather gives Allison a disapproving look , as if to say " do n't be stupid , stupid . " As Heather and Allison approach the Victim , Harry looks up . <p> # HARRY # Alright , she ai n't comin ' around . <p> Allison lays the Backboard adjacent to the Victim , and the three place her on the Backboard . Heather is a bit rough . <p> HARRY ( CONT 'D ) ( instinctively ) Whoa , easy . <p> # HEATHER # ( without looking up ) I know what I 'm doing . <p> Harry gives a concerned look to Allison , who returns the look , but the two say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambulance as Heather looks on .

AMBULANCE  --  CONTINUOUS Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim , and Heather is again behind the wheel , moving her head ever so slightly , as if to music playing in her head . Heather 's moderate driving speed is in sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene . At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier , Heather <p> 17 stops and looks in all directions before proceeding , even though there are no cars at the intersection . <p> # HARRY # Uh , Heather , you want to step on it ? <p> # HEATHER # We 'll get there . <p> # ALLISON # You do n't even know for sure if she slept with Steve ! <p> Heather turns around in the driver seat , taking her eyes off the road . <p> # HEATHER # Listen , fuck that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell !

He looks in the window on the pantry door . He backs up and <p> 18 looks toward Emily , blank . He looks back up at the house , frustrated . He about-faces , steps over to the side of the neighboring house , unzips his pants , looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around , and starts pissing .

Jimmy 's gaze wanders mechanically to anther part of the kitchen falls upon the entrance to the living room . The terribly familiar figure , BUGGERIN ' BOBBY BALES , stands tall , proud , talking to several Partygoers , the light behind him adding a regal air to his menacing frame - a transcendent silhouette for a hellish vision . Bobby towers easily over his peers . In his powerful hands he holds a tiny notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their bets . RJ , a young African-American early-twenty-something , easily six feet tall , built like a powerlifter , his worn-out t-shirt doing little to hide his powerful frame , appears behind Jimmy . <p> RJ You 're Jimmy ? <p> Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're Sinjin ? <p> RJ RJ .

JIMMY and RJ are looking across the room at SINJIN , a young African-American male about RJ 's age , with an average build , sharply dressed in a button-down , and sport coat . Sinjin has his back to Jimmy , and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads . LOUIE , an overweight , slobbish Caucasian male a few years older than Sinjin , sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that might creak even more than Sinjin 's pogo stick - in Louie 's lap rests a BOWLING BALL BAG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOTTLE nervously .

Passing by a now high EMILY backed up against a tree staring off into nowhere as MALE PARTYGOER 1 kisses her neck , they arrive at Carlos ' Car . Carlos walks over to the driver-side door , but Jessica walks immediately over to the trunk . <p> CARLOS ( CONT 'D ) What are you doing ?

Aaron is holding a bag of FROZEN VEGETABLES to his head in the area where Jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle . He spots Carlos and Jessica , and walks deliberately toward them . <p> # CARLOS # Get in the car . <p> # JESSICA # I 'm staying , and so are you , so shut up . <p> Carlos swallows his pride , too yellow to push the point . Aaron moves toward Jessica very quickly , but a look at the bat Jessica is holding makes Aaron keep his distance . <p> JESSICA ( CONT 'D ) What 's the matter ?

I knew you would . <p> 112 # JESSICA # You 're an idiot . <p> # AARON # I know . <p> Jessica touches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # AARON # No . Try whacking it with the bat . <p> Jessica laughs as Aaron smiles . Troy is bored . Carlos is miserable . Jessica stands up in front of Aaron , holding the Bat loosely by her side , unsure of what to do . Aaron gently grabs Jessica around the elbows and pulls her close . He puts his arms around her and hugs her loosely . <p> AARON ( CONT 'D ) Can we just forget about this ? <p> # JESSICA # Yes . <p> Aaron hugs Jessica tightly as she drops the Bat and hugs back . <p> # AARON # Happy birthday . <p> # JESSICA # Thank you . <p> EXT .
