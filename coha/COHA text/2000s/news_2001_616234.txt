<p> Drawn by better pay and cheaper living , thousands of Latino workers have moved to the Dalton area since the 1990s . In the process , they 've helped transform this town of 28,000 , once heralded as the " Carpet Capital of the World . " <p> Now , the area is also the Hispanic capital of Georgia , at least in percentage terms . Whitfield County has a higher proportion of Hispanics  --  22 percent  --  than any other county in Georgia , according to the 2000 census . <p> More than 40 percent of the residents of Dalton , the county seat , trace their roots to Mexico , Guatemala and other Latin American countries . They 've launched over 150 restaurants , newspapers , retail shops and other Latino-owned businesses . <p> In addition , more and more Hispanics are buying homes in the Dalton area . <p> Carlos and Mayra Salguero , who came to the United States from Guatemala in 1986 , have sold about 120 homes to Latino families since 1999 . The pair say they 've sold 17 homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and two sisters-in-law to the real estate business in the past two years , recently opened an all-bilingual real estate office for Coldwell Banker Kinard Realty to concentrate on the rapidly growing Hispanic home buyer market . <p> No one keeps statistics on Hispanics who have bought homes in the Dalton area , but one measure , says Carlos Salguero , is the parade of Hispanic home buyers , about two a day , he sees going into an attorney 's office near his office to complete home purchases . <p> Martha Meza hopes to join the parade . Her husband , 28-year-old Luis Meza , left Zacatecas , Mexico , about 16 years ago for California . A decade ago , she also moved there from Guadalajara . The $7 or $8 an hour her husband made as a wrecker driver and the $4.60 she made working in a hotel were n't enough to buy a home near Sacramento . Then her brother-in-law heard from a friend about $10-an-hour jobs in the carpet mills and inexpensive homes in Dalton , and moved there three years ago . The Mezas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now makes $10.25 an hour driving a forklift for carpet maker Beaulieu of America . She stays at home to raise their two children now . But to buy a house , she adds , she 'll work again if necessary . <p> " My husband thought it was impossible getting a house , but I kept pushing him , " she says . " I want to see my children grow up and have their own rooms . Their own space to play , you know ? " <p> She was Salguero 's sixth client of the day . It 's about 4:30 p.m . Five more to go . <p> ' A survivor community ' <p> Longtime residents say Hispanic immigrants began trickling into the Dalton area in the 1960s , to help build Carters Lake Dam , 20 miles southeast of town , and stayed . <p> But it was n't until the mid-1990s that significant numbers of Hispanics , mostly Mexican nationals , began arriving in earnest . They were drawn by high-paying jobs in Dalton 's carpet industry , which added 12,000 jobs between 1986 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill roughly 35 percent of carpet factory jobs , earning the industry $10.50-an-hour average . <p> Half of the Mexican nationals living in the Dalton area , like the rest of Georgia , are undocumented immigrants , estimates Bernardo Mendez , with the Mexican Consulate General in Atlanta . <p> And like songbirds that come with the spring blossoms , they will scatter again if a recession chills the carpet industry , predicts Mendez , a former economics professor at the Autonomous Metropolitan University in Mexico . <p> " The carpet industry is key . " If that industry declines , many will find other jobs elsewhere using networks of friends and relatives scattered across the country . " The undocumented people ... will move according to the market , " he says . <p> The carpet industry has slowed , helping boost Dalton 's jobless rate from 4.7 percent in February to 5.3 percent in March , well above the statewide rate , 3.7 percent . <p> " It may not be a large loss , " says University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys , but the carpet industry will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders ' slowing demand for carpet . He says the industry 's profits will probably drop faster than sales this year . <p> Louis Fordham , vice president at Dalton carpet maker J &J; Industries , says he 's already seeing more job seekers who were laid off or with curtailed workweeks . The flow " is very high right now , as high as it 's ever been , " he says . His 800-employee firm gets over 500 applications each month  --  up to 40 percent from Latinos  --  for fewer than 10 openings a month . <p> Still , despite the slowdown and the fact that many Latino workers shuttle between the United States and their home countries every year or two , Fordham thinks more Hispanics have developed ties to the Dalton area . <p> " We 're seeing more what I would call rooting , " he says . Many have had their kids in local schools for years , and about two-thirds of the Hispanic job applicants he sees have lived in the area from one to five years . <p> Mayra Salguero does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're still buying houses , " she says . " They were used to working 60 hours a week . Now they 're working 40 hours a week . " <p> In any case , Dalton 's business leaders  --  both Hispanic and non-Hispanic  --  argue that a recession is n't likely to alter the area 's demographic and cultural trends . <p> The carpet industry boom is over , says George Woodward , president of the Dalton-Whitfield Chamber of Commerce . But " I do not see a downturn in the economy causing these people to leave in mass , " he adds . <p> Hispanic-owned businesses are n't the only ones capitalizing on the city 's demographic shift . Wyoming-based Corral West Ranchwear opened its first store east of the Mississippi River in Dalton 's Walnut Square Mall last June because of the town 's large Hispanic population , says mall manager Dan Wolfe . More stores are advertising in Spanish , and La Plaza , a business that caters to Hispanics with services ranging from citizenship classes to real estate sales , opened in March . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hispanics , says Ken Car-ter , manager of the Dalton store . To accommodate nondriving shoppers , the store built a covered taxi stand with benches . <p> Taxi companies have also thrived , says Woodward , since Dalton does n't have public transportation . There are now seven or eight firms , compared with one five years ago . In addition , local schools , businesses and Latino community leaders have done much over the past few years to accommodate and adjust , including establishing bilingual training , building soccer fields and churches , and starting cultural exchanges . <p> " Everything we 've done here is to work together to keep the economy strong , " he says . <p> Base camp <p> Even if Dalton 's economy did take a turn for the worse , the city has become something of a base camp for Latino families , adds Norberto Reyes , owner of the Los Reyes restaurant in Dalton and several other businesses . <p> " The way the Latinos work is if you do n't have a job , then you come live with us until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at our community as being a survivor community , " agrees Saul Adame , owner of Saltillo Hard Surfaces tile business next door to Los Reyes . For many Hispanic families , Dalton is where their children were born and where they feel comfortable in a town that is now " pretty diversified , " he adds . " For our community to grow this big in this short a time without any big problems is just amazing . " <p> Not that Dalton has n't gone through some pain . <p> City and county school officials initially seemed not to know what had hit them when enrollments of Spanish-speaking children swelled . <p> The number of Hispanic students in Dalton 's schools more than doubled from 1996 to 2000 , while the number of non-Hispanic students  --  both white and black  --  dropped . Hispanic children now account for over half of the Dalton school district 's 5,310 students . <p> That pattern was mirrored outside the schools as well . While Dalton 's Latino population grew by almost 9,800 during the past decade to 11,219 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27,912 , census figures show . <p> Hispanic students , mostly U.S.-born , now make up more than 80 percent of the student body in one elementary school , says Sheila Evans , assistant superintendent for Dalton Public Schools . <p> Five years ago , the school had almost no teachers who spoke Spanish , already the main language of about half the students , recalls Erwin Mitchell . Teachers were so involved with Spanish-speaking kids that parents of the other kids were switching to private schools , says the 76-year-old lawyer and Dalton native . <p> It was a " deplorable situation , " says Mitchell , who led an effort to create a teacher exchange program between Dalton 's schools and a Mexican university . <p> Supported by city , private and federal funds , the program has since sent 38 American teachers to the University of Monterrey for bilingual and cultural training since 1997 , and brought 56 teacher trainees to Dalton . <p> Now , a fifth of the school district 's 452 employees are bilingual , says Evans . They include three of the Monterrey exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent jobs . All students through fifth grade in Dalton now study both English and Spanish , while students from the third grade up , who enter the schools speaking little English , get yearlong crash courses . <p> Passing grades <p> Longtime Hispanic residents give the city , schools and police passing marks on their dealings with Latino residents , but say misunderstandings occur . The city and police department have " done a great job " adjusting , says Reyes , the restaurateur , but " there 's still a lot of ignorance on both sides . " <p> James Chadwick , Dalton 's police chief since 1993 , thinks his department has made strides . Most of Dalton 's 80 police officers have taken Spanish classes , he says , and it 's now part of job evaluations . <p> Dalton 's real estate industry , is still adjusting , say the Salgueros . Almost daily they help Latino home buyers , mostly immigrants with resident alien status , deal with the lack of bilingual loan officers , lawyers and other professionals . It 's also a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or experience buying houses in the United States , they say . <p> The Salgueros typically help clients build credit histories from scratch using letters from cable and utility companies and auto and furniture sellers . They often also act as interpreters between their clients and banks , lawyers and other firms . <p> Before showing Meza a home , Carlos Salguero stops by a First Union branch to help Estel Sierra complete a loan application . <p> " What does it say ? " asks Vickie Hill , a First Union loan officer , as she examines a letter that Sierra brought from a Mexico attorney . <p> The letter is employment proof . Salguero translates the paragraphs stating that Sierra worked on a farm near Zacatecas for seven months last year while her husband worked at a Mohawk Industries carpet factory in Dalton . <p> Salguero translates Hill 's questions and Sierra 's answers as she completes the loan form . Sierra 's 19-year-old daughter , Daisy , and 16-year-old son , Iban , also help , speaking English and Spanish . <p> Hill says Latinos account for up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a handful two years ago . First Union 's Dalton office needs and has tried to hire bilingual staff officers , she adds , but the bank 's bilingual loan processors at its Florida underwriting operations also help by calling customers directly . <p> But Salguero and other Hispanic real estate agents will remain heavily involved , she predicts , until their clients become accustomed to using bank accounts and buying homes and other items on credit . <p> Because of the language barrier , atypical credit histories and a shortage of affordable homes in the Dalton area , Salguero pursues his trade with quiet persistence . Some clients take up to a year to get a loan and a house , he says . <p> Working about 70 hours a week , he has almost tripled his income over his previous maintenance job at a carpet plant and the factory owner 's house . But money is n't the only thing that keeps him in the business , he adds . <p> Most satisfying is when a customer whose mortgage applications have been rejected two or three times comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan and they move into their own house  --  it makes you feel good , " he says . HISPANIC MAGNET Hispanics became one of the leading ethnic groups in Dalton and surrounding Whitfield County in the 1990s , with dramatic effects on the local school system and community .
