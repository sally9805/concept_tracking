The men 's 10,000 m , the first marquee race of the track-and-field events , was always going be Ethiopia 's . The only question was which Ethiopian : the popular two-time gold medalist Haile Gebrselassie , 31 , or the astonishing young Kenenisa Bekele , 22 ? In just nine days last spring , Bekele smashed Gebrselassie 's records in both the 10,000 m and the 5,000 m . Perhaps , though , the wily old campaigner had one last victory in him . <P> For the first few laps of the 25-lap race , Gebrselassie stayed with the lead pack as it glided its way around the graceful Olympic Stadium . By the 5000-m mark , Bekele , Gebrselassie and Ethiopia 's third runner , Sileshi Sihine , were 1-2-3 . The Ethiopian trio was soon lapping slower runners , even as the younger men seemed to slow the pace to accommodate Gebrselassie . But then he began to struggle . At 7,500 m , he fell back for a lap before coming again , fighting off pain , hoping he could run through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking the competition and leaving Gebrselassie behind . Bekele accelerated into the final lap , scorching around the track in just 53.02 sec. to win in a time of 27:05.10 . That 's some 45 sec. off his world record , but it bested by two sec . Gebrselassie 's Olympic mark set eight years ago in Atlanta . Gebrselassie struggled across the line in fifth in what he says will be his last 10,000-m race . He may now become a marathoner . The shy Bekele was giggling with happiness after the race , and he plans to run the 5,000 m later this week . The long  --  and the very long  --  of it is that Africa lost a star but not a step in its continuing domination of distance .  --  By Simon Robinson/Athens
