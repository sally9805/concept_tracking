The ski resort of Shemshak , just outside Tehran , is the last place you would expect to hear expressions of nationalist ardor . The slopes are filled with wealthy Iranians who sip hot chocolate in the shadow of a dazzling sun and spend most of their time gabbing about designer skiwear and which party to attend that evening . But when the subject of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad comes up between runs , the skiers get excited . " I could n't be happier with him , " says Mehdi , 19 , an architecture major . " We just want our rights , and he defends them . " His sister Anahita , 24 , says she changed her mind about the President when he refused to abandon the country 's nuclear-energy program . " He stood behind his world like a man , " she says . <P> That an Islamic hard-liner has inspired such pride among even secular , Westernized Iranians says everything about the political climate in Iran today and shows how Ahmadinejad has transformed himself from a lightly regarded ideologue to a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalating standoff over Iran 's nuclear program as a platform for broadening his appeal at home , framing the West as an enemy bent on weakening Iran by denying it legitimate access to technology .

But now with neighboring Iraq in turmoil , Iranians seem more concerned with bolstering their place in the region than with freedom of expression . A growing sense of vulnerability is why many find it easy to ignore Ahmadinejad 's fundamentalist outlook and provocative remarks and concentrate on his nationalist defiance . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran should be weak either , or else we 'll end up like Iraq , " says Nazanin Arafin , 33 , a teacher .

" <P> While he rallies supporters to back a more confrontational stance with the West , Ahmadinejad has soothed the anxieties of young Iranians , who initially feared he would crush their personal freedoms . Instead government meddling has been limited to blocking thousands of news and cultural websites . Some believe the regime will impose harsher social restrictions with time , but others argue Ahmadinejad will refrain altogether , to avoid alienating the majority of young people , among whom he is now popular . Young Iranians are excited to find a leader who lets them wear baggy jeans and pink veils , and still stands up to what they consider a belligerent U.S. " Our civilization is far superior , " says Vahid Mobaraki , 28 , a gold merchant in the Tehran bazaar .
