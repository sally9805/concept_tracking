WELLIVER TUNG HAD OWED Luff Imbry a sum of money for longer than was advisable . The amount was more than five thousand hepts , Imbry 's commission on the return to their owner of certain items that had gone astray late one evening when Tung found herself in the objects ' presence while passing through the private rooms of the financier Hundegar Abrax while he and his household slept . <p> Abrax had not wanted the nature of the missing items to become public knowledge . He knew people who knew people who knew Imbry . Overtures were made , inquiries carried out , the items located and a finder 's fee agreed upon . Neither Tung nor Imbry had thought it wise to attend the transfer of the goods to Abrax 's agent , in case the Archonate Bureau of Scrutiny had somehow caught a whisper of the doings . They sent a young man experienced in such assignments who did not mind having all of his memories - except for the time , place , and terms of the handover - temporarily misplaced . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and double vision , but the fellow considered himself adequately paid . <p> The operation was carried out with smooth precision on a busy corner in the ancient City of Olkney , capital of the incomparably more ancient world of Old Earth . But Welliver Tung did not keep her appointment the next day at Bolly 's Snug , a tavern where Imhry often liked to conduct business , - its back reaches were a warren of private rooms , some with ingenious exits known only to those who paid the owner , Bashur Bolly , handsomely for that knowledge . <p> Imbry waited until it was clear that Tung was not coming , then returned to his operations center - a concealed room in a nondescript house in a quiet corner of Olkney - to consult his information retrieval matrix . He soon ascertained that Tung had not been taken up by the scroots overnight , nor had she been fished out of Mornedy Sound with heavy objects fastened to her person - an occasional occupational hazard of her profession . <p> Imbry placed the tips of his plump fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought through the situation . Tung knew him well enough to understand the danger inherent in pulling him when he expected a push , as the expression went . If she was withholding the fat man 's commission it was because she needed the funds . If she needed the funds to pay a debt to someone whose collection methods might be even more appalling than Luff Imbry 's , he would have heard of it . Therefore , she required the five thousand hepts to take advantage of some opportunity to earn even more , out of which she would seek to mollify Imbry with a bonus . <p> He returned to his research matrix and made inquiries that spun off from Welliver Tung 's several fictitious identities , which he knew about though she did not know that he knew . Data flowed his way and he soon snapped up a telling mote : under the name Harch Belanye , Tung had that morning placed a deposit on a derelict house in Ombron Square , in a district that had once been fashionable but had now fallen into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more research , this time centered on the property , and acquired further facts . After careful thought , he decided to equip himself with a needier , a police-issue shocker and an elision suit . The garment was made of a material that bent light around its wearer , making him unnoticeable except to the well-trained eye . He retrieved the items from a concealed closet that was well stocked with the tools of his illicit trade , many of them designed by Imbry himself . <p> Outside , he summoned a public aircar and had it drop him beside an alley two streets from Ombron Square . There he slipped into the elision suit , positioned his weapons for easy deployment , and set off to find Welliver Tung . His unseen passage along the debris-strewn streets excited no comment from the few pedestrians he slipped past . <p> The house that Tung had bought dated from the umpteenth revival of an ornate style of architecture that Imbry considered both finicky and overdone . Its defenses were also standard and he rapidly tickled his way through them , entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cleaning systems had cycled down to minimal , and dust hung in the air , along with a faintly sweet mustiness that Imbry recognized as the scent of death , attenuated by the passing of several years . <p> The odor corroborated what Imbry had gathered from his researches : the former owner of the property , Tib den Aarrafol , had been a recluse with few associates and no family . He had not been seen in public for more than a decade , and had most likely died a solitary death here at home , his corpse drying and moldering inconspicuously while the house puttered on about him . At some point , tollsters from the Archonate 's fiduciary division had affixed a notice to the door stipulating that unless unpaid taxes were made good , the place would be auctioned . Tib denAarrafol being unable to meet his obligations , the property had gone to the sole bidder : Welliver Tung . <p> Imbry listened and deduced that the new owner was engaged in moving furniture in one of the front rooms . With his shocker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his way toward the scraping and bumping . At the end of a dimly lit hall he peered through a doorway and spied his debtor shoving chairs and side tables across the uncarpeted floor , leaving a blank space before a sideboard that stood against the far wall . On its recently dusted surface rested what looked to be a dull black stone the size of Imbry 's head , set in an armature of tarnished silver . <p> The fat man turned his gaze to each corner of the room , determining that Welliver Tung was alone . Then he stepped into the doorway , aimed both weapons and said , " You owe me . " <p> Tung neither squeaked nor jumped . Imbry admired the professionalism that caused her to freeze , then turn oh so slowly toward the door , showing her hands empty and well clear of her body . He knew that all she was seeing was a slight shimmer behind a needier and shocker suspended in the air and directed her way . But his voice would have been unmistakable . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I was hoping to have enough time to ready this for you . " <p> " In situations like this I have found it useful to appear unexpectedly , " he said . <p> " I fully intended to pay you . " <p> " Of course you did . Now explain to me , and be brief , why you have n't , and while you do so I will weigh the penalty . " <p> She had prepared her story . She had been looking for out-of-the-way premises in which to store various items over the short to medium terms and had canvassed abandoned properties in this district . The denAarrafol house had seemed promising , so she had entered and inspected it , finding the former owner upstairs in bed , where he had quietly expired some years previously . <p> His faint presence did not disturb Tung , who had then gone through the house carefully , in case there might be objects of value pining away for want of ownership . She had found two secret compartments , one of which contained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author assumed that magical spells could be efficacious . <p> " It seems that denAarrafol dabbled in thaumaturgy , " she said . " He was working on a book of his own when he died . He believed that magic and rationalism alternated over the aeons in a great cycle and that we are approaching a cusp at which the Wheel turns anew and spells and cantrips become operative , while physics and chemistry become unreliable . " <p> " I have heard of the theory , " Imbry said . " It can be a useful construct when separating the gullible from their assets . " <p> " It turns out there is something to it , " Tung said . <p> " Oh ? " <p> " Along with the spell book and various paraphernalia , I found that , " Tung said , indicating the stone on the sideboard . <p> " And that is ? " Imbry said , stepping into the room for a closer inspection of the black thing , though he kept an eye on Welliver Tung . <p> " In denAarrafol 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicator , ' " Tung said . " It reveals the purpose of a life . " <p> " Of life in general ? " <p> " No , of a specific life - yours , mine , anyone 's . " <p> Imbry peered more closely at the stone . It seemed to be a mere lump of black stuff , dull and unreflective . " And how is this determined ? " <p> " It is difficult to .... " Tung broke off . " You 're going to think that I am trying to slip a flat one under you . " <p> " You would not want me to think that , " Imbry said . He assessed the unconscious messages that came from her face and posture , as well as the tiny beads of perspiration that appeared on her upper lip . " I believe you are about to offer me what you , at least , believe to be the truth . " <p> He saw honest relief wash over her . " I 'm waiting , " he said . <p> " DenAaarafol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - not an organ like the brain but the ' condition of being aware ' was how he put it - of an entity that inhabits another continuum , " she said . " This entity comprehends the interlinkages of all life in our continuum . It knows the why of every creature 's existence . " <p> " Some sort of god ? " Imbry asked . <p> " No , " she said , " for it can do nothing with the information . DenAarrafol likened it to a book on a shelf , though the kind of intelligence that would open such a book and read what is written in it was beyond his comprehension . This lump represents but a single ' page , ' a page that nonetheless contains the meaning of every life on Old Earth , and perhaps even all the lives of the trillion inhabitants of the Ten Thousand Worlds . " <p> Several large questions came to mind , but Imbry put them aside for later consideration and chose instead to ask a small and simple one . " Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salience indicator ? ' " <p> " It wo n't move , " she said . She spread her hands in a gesture of bafflement . " Again , I do n't understand it , but it seems that the object is not really ' here . ' Instead , an ' impression ' of it is reflected into our universe , but a reflection from its continuum manifests itself as a dense and lightless object in ours , though it remains ' connected ' in some manner . In short , it would be easier to move the Devenish Range to the other side of the planet than to budge that thing a hairbreadth . " <p> Imbry moved on to another question . " How docs it work ? " Then he quickly added one more . " And what docs it actually do ? " <p> The operation was uncomplicated : touch the black lump with the written name or the image of any person , or even an item that had often been in close proximity to the subject . The effect was also simple , Tung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's existence appeared in the mind of he who had initiated the operation . <p> Imbry digested the information . " Then if I write my name on a piece of paper and bring it into contact with the object , it will reveal to me the meaning of my existence ? " <p> " No , " said Tung . " It will reveal to you the meaning of anyone else 's existence except your own . The thaumaturge found that seeking to know his own salience brought on a blinding headache . He conjectured that persevering would create a feedback resonance that would damage his brain . " <p> " Damage how ? " <p> " Boiling followed by melting , was how he put it . " <p> " You have , of course , tested denAarrafol 's surmises ? " <p> " I have . They seem to be correct . " <p> " And thus your plan was to reopen the house as a venue for revealing the meaning of their lives to those who would offer a reasonable fee ? " Imbry said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became the vogue to discover one 's salience , I intended to charge a quite unreasonable fee , out of which I would repay what I owe you , plus a substantial bonus . " <p> " A good plan , " Imbry said . " It requires only one small emendation . " <p> Tung stiffened . " I think it is perfect as it is . " <p> " You lack the perspective , " said Imbry , " of someone with two weapons . " <p> Her shoulders slumped . " I have made a considerable outlay from my limited resources to acquire this house . " <p> " From my resources , " Imbry corrected her . " Thus it shall be a joint venture . I shall take eighty parts ; you will have twenty . But , out of gratitude , I shall write off the five thousand hepts you owe me . " <p> " This seems unjust . " <p> " It seemed no less unjust to me that my five thousand were put to work without my consent . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would now he arranging to remove two corpses from these premises . " <p> Tung grumbled but acquiesced . " It was ever thus , " she said . " The big teeth take the big bites . " <p> IMBRY INVESTED more of his funds in the enterprise , thoroughly refurbishing the house so that its appearance would not startle or dismay persons of advanced social rank . When all was in readiness , he employed his research matrix to identify a dozen persons , each of whom met two criteria : they would be intrigued by the concept , and they would spread the word among the refined of Olkney in a manner that would bring those whose lives were governed by fashion to his door , thirsting for knowledge . <p> He summoned the dozen to a soiree and demonstrated the salience indicator . As he had expected , the meaning of each of the initial batch 's lives was confined to the subject 's having an effect on style . To Imbry these seemed poor excuses for existence , but the opinion makers were delighted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon spread . Imbry engaged a pair of large , silent attendants and dressed them in suitably impressive costumes . The mutes collected extravagant fees and conducted aristocrats and magnates into the presence . The fat man had determined that he would earn more if he restricted his operation to no more than one hour , every other night . The compressed supply of enlightenment speedily drove up demand , returning his investment many times over in the first week , then lifting his profit into reaches that were enough to make even Imbry blink in surprise . <p> He fastidiously meted out to Welliver Tung every grimlet that she was owed as a twenty-percent participant in the venture . Her take must have greatly exceeded whatever she might have expected to have received before his entry into the proceedings , Imbry knew . Yet she showed a sour attitude , even as he handed her a valise bulging with pelf . <p> To cheer her , he said , " Let me put your name to the salience indicator . Free of charge . It will be as if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative . " I decided from the beginning that that was not a knowledge I cared to encompass . " <p> " Why ? " Imbry said , in an airy tone . " Did you not wish to discover that the point of your existence was to assist me in my goals ? " <p> Tung 's eyes became narrow , glinting with a hard light , but she said nothing . She departed and Imbry prepared to receive the next intake of well-heeled punters . <p> In time , however , a bleakness threatened to descend upon the fat man . He tired of the sameness of the life-meanings he dispensed to the highest echelons of Old Earth society . Too often , he was required to extemporize an answer because he soon discovered that telling the unvarnished truth , as it appeared in his mind when he touched a name or image to the lump , could never satisfy the client . <p> A young lordling did not welcome being told , " The meaning of your life is that you will father a child who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , bump into a man on a street corner , causing that man to miss an appointment . " <p> They preferred to hear , " Because of a remark that you drop into a casual conversation , a brilliant new epoch in appliqued fabric design will sweep the finest salons of Olkney . Unfortunately , it will not become the overpowering vogue until months after your demise , but your genius will be recognized as its inciting spark , and the ages will remember you and bless your name . " <p> He was not surprised that the clients found these patent fantasies much more palatable than the blunt truth . But it continued to wear on Imbry that so many of the lives he touched to the salience indicator were revealed to be of almost no consequence at all . So many people were little more than placeholders , keeping a seat warm until someone of true moment should come along and briefly occupy it . <p> " But , perhaps , " he told himself , " I achieve these tiresome , tawdry results because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live notoriously unproductive lives . If I sought out saints and savants , I would likely see cheerier visions . " <p> Then he reminded himself that the quality of the visions was not the purpose of the endeavor . The goal was to make wealth flow thickly toward Luff Imbry , and the returns were more than handsome . Imbry used them to indulge his increasingly elevated tastes and fancies - especially those that arose from his gustatory appetites . He devoured dishes that were legendary , including some that could not be created more than once in a century , so rare were the ingredients . From these occasions he derived a grim satisfaction , reveling in the textures and aromas , while saying to himself , If not I , then who ? <p> Sometimes , as he lay in his bed , the savors of the evening 's feast lingering on his palate , his mind would drift toward the inevitable question . Always , he pushed temptation away . What would it serve to know the salience of Luff Imbry ? If he learned the context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not expect much good ) , could he summon the strength to go on doing as he did ? <p> He recalled one client whose purpose in life was discharged even before he reached full maturity : by waving a wad of currency under the percepts of an autocab , the young buck had snatched it from a poor young woman already late for an interview with an editor , thus smothering a prospective great literary career in its infancy . The rest of the client 's life was an empty afterthought . The young woman 's fate was unrecorded . <p> Suppose Imbry discovered that the point of his being had been unwittingly achieved in his youth . Could he go on filling and voiding his innards , year upon year , knowing that his moment had already come and gone , unmarked , unheeded ? <p> Or suppose , for all his mastery of the arts of peculation and hornswogglery , he turned out to be but a minor player in someone else 's grander game - the user used - would his pride withstand the illumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be different if he had someone with whom he could share the burden of such knowledge , but Imbry accepted that solitariness was a necessary condition of the profession he had freely chosen . It would not do to make dear friends only to see them become liabilities that must be disposed of . <p> Then one evening , he came to the denAarrafol house to discover that Welliver Tung had arrived before him . She was waiting in the now opulent room where the salience indicator sat , wearing an expression that Imbry could only characterize as a mean-hearted sulk . <p> He sent one of the attendants to retrieve her portion of the week 's proceeds : the big man returned lugging two filled satchels , but Tung accepted them with ill grace . <p> " What is wrong ? " Imbry said . <p> " This should have been all mine . " <p> Imbry formed his plump lips into an arrangement that expressed a sad knowledge . " Be thankful that it was n't . I have discovered that there is a price to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who merely transmits the revelation . " <p> Tung made a wordless sound that indicated she neither shared nor valued his opinion . <p> Imbry said , " Not everything that passes through pipes is clean and wholesome , thus it is fortunate for many pipes that they are not burdened with awareness . " He looked inward for a moment , then said , " I have come to believe that denAarrafol 's death may have been self-inflicted . " <p> Tung made the same sound as before , only with more emphasis . " Do n't try to wax me , " she said . " I do n't hold a polish . " <p> Imbry was capable of expressing much with a shrug . He now offered her a particularly eloquent one . Her jawline grew sharp , and she reached into a pocket and withdrew a slip of paper . <p> " While I was waiting I wrote down your name , " she said . Before he could move she leaned back and touched the paper to the dull blackness . Imbry saw the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by comprehension succeeded by feline satisfaction . <p> " Do you want to know the point of your existence ? " she said . " Such as it is ? " <p> " From your face , I believe I already do , " he said . <p> " Why settle for faith when certainty is at hand ? " <p> There was a neether in his pocket . He thought about using it , then decided that he would not . He stood quietly while she told him the meaning of his life . It did not take long . <p> When she was finished he remained standing , contemplating the images she had conjured into his mind : his future self , the persons into whose story he would be drawn , the small role he would fulfill - not as the hero , not even as the pivot of fate , but as merely a supporting player in another 's drama , there to speak his lines and do his business , then fade away . <p> After a moment , his eyes came back from the vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardness in his face . Then he smiled a small smile , gave her another shrug and said , " The house is yours . I advise you to close it up and forget its secrets . " <p> He turned and left , took an air car to his favorite club and treated himself to a sumptuous dinner . He paid close attention to every facet of the experience , lingered over each dish , cherished every morsel . Sated , he retired to one of the transients ' rooms and slept better than he had for some weeks . <p> Not long after , business took him away - an extended tour of several worlds up and down The Spray , where people could be persuaded to pay remarkable sums for goods that were bedecked with just the right glamor of legend blended with trumpery . He took pleasure in his work , not because it had intrinsic meaning but because it was well wrought . <p> " It is good to have substance to one 's existence , " he told his dark reflection in the first class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamed by . " But if fate denies one substance , one can yet do a lot with style . " <p> When he returned to Olkney he learned that Welliver Tung had leapt from the upper story of the Brelle Tower . He heard nothing of what had happened to the salience indicator , and did not inquire . <p> Author Affiliation
