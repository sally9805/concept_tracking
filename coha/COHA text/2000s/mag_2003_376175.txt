A good night 's sleep is right up there with chicken soup as a cure-all . But can it help someone beat cancer ? A growing body of research suggests it might , according to an article in the current issue of Brain , Behavior and Immunity . Stanford University 's Dr. David Spiegel and his colleagues point to studies showing that shift workers have higher rates of breast cancer than women who sleep normal hours . Two possible culprits are the hormones melatonin and cortisol . Melatonin is an antioxidant that mops up damaging free radicals , but the body produces less of it when sleep cycles are disrupted . Cortisol , which helps regulate the immune system , may also be compromised by troubled sleep . Says Spiegel : " Cancer might be something to lose sleep over , but we 'd rather help people regain the sleep and lose the cancer . "  --  By David Bjerklie
