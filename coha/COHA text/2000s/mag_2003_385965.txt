Section : 10 MILES SQUARE News , traffic , weather , whiny bureaucrats . <p> Every Monday morning for the past 18 months , Mike Causey and Marlis Majerus have sat down in a small studio on the third floor of a nondescript office building in Northwest Washington to broadcast a live show on Federal News Radio . Causey and Majerus 's show , " Your Turn , " is , in theory at least , a call-in program . But five minutes before show time on this early October morning , it 's clear that Causey and Majerus have n't had much practice working the phone lines . There is no sound coming through the pair 's headphones , making it impossible for them to hear callers . Despite her feverish efforts , Majerus has n't been able to figure out how to adjust the knobs and dials in front of her to fix the problem . Eventually , a studio technician comes to her aid before the show begins . Says Causey : " We do n't get many calls " <p> But that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available online at federalnewsradio.com ) is a **25;1721;TOOLONG venture grandly billed as " the world 's first Internet only all-news radio station and Web site covering world and national news with a particular focus on the Federal Government . " Federal News Radio 's sister station WTOP rebroadcasts some of FNR 's segments . But the vast majority of FNR 's approximately 50,000-70,000 listening each day through computers are federal workers whose bosses are often tuning into the same show down the hall . As a result , most feds resist the temptation to call in : Sounding off on the air may be good therapy , after all , but it 's probably not the best career move . <p> So instead , they work out their anger via email . Causey receives more than 50 messages in his inbox each day , most of them in response to whatever topic he 's addressed in his daily column , which he discusses on air . Lately , most of the emails he 's received have ranged from quiet worry to panic over the White House 's plans to outsource many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FNR 's listeners their livelihoods . Over the past three years , the administration has instituted a system that identifies specific federal positions which are candidates for privatization and notifies their holders . " Government workers call it the yellow pages rule , " says Causey . " If they can find your job in the yellow pages , then your ass is outta here " Roughly 450,000 federal jobs have now been identified as targets for competition from private companies , according to Paul Light , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor of public service at New York University . Now , it 's starting to actually happen , and workers in all corners of government are certain that they will be the next to go . The Halliburton contracts in Iraq have been a big item of complaint for feds writing into FNR : They 're convinced , Causey says , that the administration is more interested in paying back political allies than taking care of their own . Federal unions have begun running anti-outsourcing ads , and the number of calls on the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majerus is reading an email from a federal worker named Jeanne . In order to protect Jeanne , Majerus does not share her last name with listeners . <p> " I want someone to explain why outsourcing is such a great idea , " Majerus reads , taking a sip of her water . " Government is complicated , and it takes years to gain the knowledge and expertise to do what we do . How can they be so willing to throw away or disregard the qualified work staffs they now have on board ? " <p> There are about 400,000 federal workers and retirees in the D.C. metro area  --  and thousands more if you count employees at those agencies , like the C.I.A. , that do n't officially divulge the number of people on their payrolls . The station is most popular with employees at the Treasury Department , National Institutes of Health , and the Department of Defense . Pentagon workers are responsible for more of the emails hostile toward the administration than any other department , FNR officials say . <p> Snarky observers might speculate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to a talk radio station deserve to have their jobs outsourced . Indeed , Federal News Radio 's listeners tend to be the federal system 's office managers and human-resource specialists  --  those concerned more with retirement plans and healthcare options than issues of high policy . And FNR knows how to serve its audience . <p> The station generates about 70 percent of its content itself , with the remainder coming from the Associated Press ( small portions also being taken from WTOP and CBS Radio ) . The station runs short segments ' ( in distinctive , rat-tat-tat " you give us 22 minutes , we 'll give you the world " radio-news ticker style ) tailored to bureaucrats , with breaks for commercials similarly targeted to federal workers . ( Geico offers special deals on car insurance to government officials . ) This gives the station a certain quirky , charming obscurity , filled with the sorts of stories that are vastly interesting to federal bureaucrats , and somewhat less engaging to the rest of US . <p> Listeners tuning into Mike Causey 's report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " drama and theatrical aspects of the year 2004 federal pay raise . " <p> A short news segment asked whether workers knew " that there 's a federal agency designed solely to assist government agencies with the procurement process ? " Not only is there one , the narrator intoned , but it 's online at govworks.gov . <p> Then came a brief report reminding those federal workers who were planning on charging their superiors with discrimination that they needed to contact a counselor " within 45 days of the discriminatory events "  --  or else courts would throw the claims out . <p> Federal News Radio 's undisputed star is Causey , a self-effacing , silver-haired 63-year-old with a deep baritone and an even deeper knowledge of almost everything of interest to federal workers . Causey , who wrote the " Federal Diary " column at The Washington Post for more than 20 years before coming to Federal News Radio , does n't always take on the sexiest of issues  --  recently , he discussed the state of healthcare premiums and the intricacies of Office of Management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air but his straightforward , no-frills approach has resonated with feds . <p> " He 's like a rock star for federal workers , " says WTOP Vice President Jim Farley . " They come up at conventions and ca n't believe it 's really him . " <p> Causey prides himself on not being alarmist : He 's long been critical of the media for overstating the problems faced by federal workers . But he believes that his listeners are right to be concerned about privatization  --  and civilians probably should be , too . Light has stated that there is little solid evidence that outsourcing actually produces cost savings and that rashly made cuts can undermine the efficient delivery of services . Outsourcing does , however , yield one important political result : It puts money in the pockets of private contractors , which can then kick some of that Cash back to the politicians who gave them the contracts in the first place . To be sure , some sectors of the federal work force are rife with inefficiency and dead weight . But it has more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . <p> " I think the typical fed wants to ask Tom DeLay why he does n't replace the federal workers who guard the Capitol , " says Causey . " That cop who was killed  --  remember that cop who got killed guarding the Capitol ? He was a federal worker . He gave his life for the country . I do n't know if some guy from Brinks would do that . There 's a patriotism in feds that people do n't recognize . " TIDBITS &; OUTRAGES The other 49 states do n't really need safe airports <p> When the Bush administration recently proposed privatizing air traffic control at dozens of airports around the country , Rep. Don Young ( R-Alaska ) , chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , intervened to get his state 's two major airports taken off the list , explaining " airplanes take right off towards my hotel room ... it 's an interesting experience , and I want to make sure everything is done right in that field . " That 's " The Nation 's Paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job listing on the Web site of the American Copy Editing Society : " Looking for a conservative who ca sic work to achieve sic consensus with a diverse editorial board . " He had last-minute doubts about the candidate : <p> Carl Miner of Blytheville , Ark. , thought he was a shoe-in for a seat on the Mississippi County school board , since he was running unopposed . Unfortunately , not a single person voted  --  including Miner . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Federal News Radio 's Mike Causey . <p> By Brian Montopoli <p> <p> Brian Montopoli is a Washington , D.C. , writer . <p>
