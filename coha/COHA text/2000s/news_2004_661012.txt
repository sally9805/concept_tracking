<p> The press release from the Pentagon was terse : <p> " The Department of Defense announced today the death of four soldiers supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom . They died on April 24 , in Taji , Iraq , when mortar rounds hit their camp . The four soldiers were assigned to the Army National Guard 's 39th Support Battalion , 39th Brigade Combat Team , 1st Cavalry Division , Hazen , Ark . Killed were : <p> Capt . Arthur L. Felder , 36 , of Louisville , Ark . <p> Chief Warrant Officer Patrick W. Kordsmeier , 49 , of North Little Rock , Ark . <p> Staff Sgt. Billy J. Orton , 41 , of Humnoke , Ark . <p> Staff Sgt. Stacey C. Brandon , 35 , of Hazen , Ark . <p> The incident is under investigation . " <p> For four families , the news came with a knock on the door by a somber officer in dress uniform . For four communities , it was a sharp and heavy rock thrown into a pond of thought and feeling , rippling inexorably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , their colleagues and neighbors , had gone to war , and now they were n't coming back . <p> At time of writing , the number of US military personnel killed in Iraq stood at 772 . This is the longest , fiercest , sustained combat Americans have seen in a generation - since Vietnam . Compared with earlier major wars , the number of military fatalities there is not yet large . Still , it took four years in Southeast Asia for the toll of US military losses to reach 500 ; the number reached that level over 10 months in Iraq . And while each individual loss is profoundly tragic for the families affected , the ripple effect of such losses in Iraq - the number of family , friends , and colleagues , the impact on communities and the organizations and informal groups that form the fabric of American society at the hometown level - in fact may be greater this time . <p> The cross section of American fighting men and women in Iraq , and especially those lost so far , hints at why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fraction are women ) who is 27 or 28 years old , quite likely to be married and to have children . This contrasts with Vietnam , where the typical enlisted soldier was drafted just out of high school or in his early 20s . In this way , those fighting - and dying - in Iraq are more like their grandfathers in World War II than their fathers in Vietnam . <p> Take Bradford , Ark. , a town of just 800 people . Last year , eight men in the community - including the mayor , the police chief , and the school librarian - were called to active duty along with others in the Army National Guard 's 39th Support Battalion headquartered in nearby Hazen . ( This is the same unit that lost the four men cited above . ) <p> Mostly older family men ( Mayor Paul Bunn has four children ) , they were told they 'd be gone a year . But they 've since learned that their tour will be extended . <p> Town Recorder Grebe Edens , who taught fourth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says everybody 's been sending care packages of toothpaste , deodorant , and snacks . " You ca n't go anywhere but what people are talking about what 's going on over there , hoping that ours all get back in one piece , " says Ms. Edens . <p> " Everybody 's concerned ; very much so , " she says . " But we 're trying to carry on just like they were here . " <p> In paying tribute to the men from Arkansas killed in that mortar attack last month , US Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( D ) could have been describing much of America 's armed forces today . " Those serving in Iraq today are not only military men , but are also doctors , lawyers , police officers , and firemen , " she said . " They are teachers , factory workers , business owners , and elected officials . Most important , they are husbands and wives - mothers and fathers ... " <p> While American GIs come from all over the country , certain generalizations can be made about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty , according to experts who study military demographics and sociology . <p> " It 's small town America and the inner city , " says Charles Moskos , a sociologist at Northwestern University in Chicago specializing in the military . <p> Those lost in this war also tend to come from communities with a slightly lower-than-average annual household income : $ 39,366 versus $ 41,994 for the country as a whole , a $ 2,628 difference . <p> " It tends to underrepresent both the top and the bottom of the socioeconomic structure , " says David Segal , director of the Center for Research on Military Organizations at the University of Maryland in College Park . <p> " The bottom gets cut out because of low educational levels , lower mental aptitude scores , poor health , or criminal records , " says Dr. Segal . " The top pretty much excludes itself . " <p> Generally speaking , today 's soldiers , sailors , airmen , and marines are older than their counterparts during the draft , which ended in 1973 . And they marry somewhat younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American male . Some enter military service well into their 20s , and many are likely to reenlist . <p> This has had a noticeable effect on the overall complexion of the force , notes Segal . <p> " More of them are married , " he says . " They 're older . They have more kids . They have civilian jobs that they 're leaving behind . They have community responsibilities , both formal and informal . " <p> But there have been other changes to the makeup of the US fighting force as well . In general , Dr. Moskos says , it is the case that " our privileged youth are no longer serving . " <p> He cites several indicators of this shift : <p> Of all 535 members of the US House and Senate today , only half a dozen have children in the military ( and just one of those is in Iraq ) . <p> Sen. Ted Kennedy ( D ) of Massachusetts and his three older brothers all served in the armed services , two of them in World War II ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 next-generation males born to Senator Kennedy and his eight brothers and sisters , none joined the military . <p> In Professor Moskos ' own class at Princeton University ( 1956 ) , more than 400 of 750 in the then all-male school , including Moskos , either were drafted or took ROTC commissions . <p> That included such notables as former Harvard President Neil Rudenstine , former Delaware Gov . Pete DuPont , and R.W. Apple of The New York Times . Out of 1,100 men and women in Princeton 's Class of 2003 , by contrast , just seven went into the military . <p> Noting that Elvis Presley willingly joined the US Army in 1958 to do his bit - serving with the Third Armored Division in Germany - Moskos asks , " Can you imagine rap singer Eminem as a draftee ? " <p> There 's another big difference , compared with a generation and a major war ago . <p> " Women not only are more present , but they 're taken seriously by the men and this is a change , " says retired US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political science at Loyola University in Chicago . <p> " There are problems with harassment and assault , but overt sexism is a career-seeking missile , as it needs to be , " says Dr. Williams . " It does n't mean that people agree that women need to be in ground combat - there are reasonable differences about that - but that they can fight and serve honorably , the debate is over about that . " <p> Women make up 13.4 percent of the active duty , National Guard , and Reserve force . Twenty US servicewomen have been killed in Iraq so far ( 2.5 percent of all US military fatalities ) , 14 of those due to hostile action . <p> Of all military men and women killed there , 121 ( 13 percent ) were in Reserve and National Guard units called to active duty . <p> The demographics of those killed are general . But over the months of the war , wire service reports of their lives and their loss reveal their individual accomplishments and especially their promise . These stories are personal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't flying helicopters , Army Chief Warrant Officer Kyran Kennedy , his wife , Kathy , and their three kids tended an orchard and managed a beekeeping operation in Kentucky . Chief Warrant Officer Kennedy was a talented woodworker who took to Iraq the dulcimer he had made . The music provided a sense of peace in the midst of war , Kathy Kennedy said . <p> Navy Reserve Lt. Kylan Jones-Huffman was fluent in French , Farsi , and Arabic . He had taught history at the US Naval Academy , and he planned to get his doctorate in Turkish studies . <p> Marine Lance Cpl . Jose Gutierrez was an orphan from Guatemala who walked part of the way to California , where he lived in a homeless shelter for a time . Joining the military " was a question of honor , " a way to pay back his adopted country , said his foster brother Max Gutierrez . <p> Like several other American servicemen killed in Iraq , Lance Corporal Gutierrez was awarded US citizenship posthumously . <p> Army Sgt.

Gregory MacDonald played classical guitar , studied philosophy as an undergraduate , and had a master 's degree from American University . He figured military experience would help a career in Middle Eastern affairs , said his close friend Jeni Spevak . <p> Like many of those in the National Guard and Reserves , which are likely to make up 40 percent of all US servicemen and women in Iraq over the next year , Army Staff Sgt. Joseph Camara was a first responder - a police officer in New Bedford , Mass . <p> Friends remember him as quiet and generous - the kind of dad who would take all the kids in his working-class neighborhood out for ice cream . <p> " Joey was a sweetheart , " fellow police officer Scott Morton told the Monitor . " It was kind of scary how much of a nice guy he was , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rhode Island National Guard , called to active duty . When his Humvee was blown up late last year , friends and colleagues around this historic whaling town immediately set up a fund to help Ana Camara and their three children . <p> Then Mr. Morton organized a benefit hockey game in which former players for the Boston Bruins faced off against a team of New Bedford police and firefighters . <p> " They killed us in the beginning , but then they kind of let us catch up , " remembers another officer . <p> Final score : 12-8 . The rink was packed with 1,200 people , and several thousand dollars was raised for the Camara family . <p> The community intends to keep helping . " If she starts having financial difficulty , we 're going to step right in , " says Officer Morton . " We may set up a scholarship fund in his name . We 'll attach Joey 's name to it , because that 's the kind of guy he was .

Eric Ayon had been a youth counselor working with gang members . Just before he died in a firefight in Al Anbar Province last month , he sent his 7- year-old son Joshua a birthday card . <p> " Being your dad is the coolest thing I 've ever done in my life , " he wrote . " You being my son makes me a better man . " <p> " I 'm sorry I 'm not there with you today , " Private Ayon wrote to his son . " I love you and I will always be around .
