HONG KONG Li CHEUNG KONG HOLDINGS/HUTCHISON WHAMPOA Asia 's richest man , Li Ka-shing , is preparing to pass on the keys to his empire . Which son will he choose  --  the steady , cerebral firstborn or the flashy , creative younger son ? 2002 Revenues : $20.5 billion <P> Wealth will not pass beyond three generations , " warns a Chinese proverb . Genes , the thinking goes , do n't always carry the entrepreneurial DNA of an empire 's founder to his descendants , who consistently dissipate the ancestral fortune . That quaint admonition must be weighing on the mind of Hong Kong  --  based alpha tycoon Li Ka-shing . Though he has given no indication that he is contemplating retirement , Asia 's richest man ( estimated net worth : $12.4 billion ) is 75 years old . Which of his two sons  --  quiet , nose-to-the-grindstone Victor or sociable , creative Richard  --  will take over the family businesses ? The Li holdings are massive and include property giant Cheung Kong Holdings , one of Hong Kong 's biggest property developers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a question that Li , as well as investors in his publicly traded companies , which have a combined market value of $74 billion , must inevitably confront in the coming years as he attempts to safeguard his immense legacy . <P> Succession is always a thorny topic , but Li 's case is sensitive because of his reputation as a dealmaker whose instincts may be impossible to duplicate . Li is also considered one of Asia 's most forward-thinking businessmen . Hutchison Whampoa was an early investor in cell-phone companies such as Voice Stream and Orange , which were sold for huge profits . The company operates mobile-phone networks in Europe , Asia and Australia , though analysts are questioning Li 's unprofitable investments in next-generation , or 3G , mobile-phone networks . It has major retail holdings in Europe ( Superdrug ) and Hong Kong , and also owns ports in the Americas , including those at each end of the Panama Canal . <P> Unlike many Asian tycoons , Li relies on nonfamily professionals to run his empire . That said , analysts do n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betting is that Li will pass his scepter to eldest son Victor , 39 , a Stanford-trained engineer and deputy chairman of Cheung Kong . <P> The choice would certainly be in keeping with Chinese tradition . Victor has been the classic filial understudy . He lives with his wife and daughters in the same house as his father . In a rare interview , Victor declined questions about succession but stressed how much he is like his legendary dad : " We 're good partners working together ... When we reach decisions , we almost always arrive at similar conclusions . " Victor adds that he has taken on many of the day-to-day business operations . At company headquarters in downtown Hong Kong , Victor says , he toils away with middle managers in his ninth-floor office , which he calls " the engine room , " while Dad plots big-picture strategy from the palatial 70th floor .
