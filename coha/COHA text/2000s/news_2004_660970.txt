<p> During all the years Nancy and Terry Sullivan were rearing six children - three of hers and three of his - they needed space . Lots of space . <p> But by the time Mrs. Sullivan 's youngest daughter graduated from college , their four-bedroom suburban home had emptied out , and the couple wanted smaller quarters . They put up a For Sale sign , bought a cozy two-bedroom condominium in nearby Ashland , Mass. , and started paring down . <p> " That was the right time to downsize , " says Sullivan , who works in public relations at Babson College in Wellesley , Mass . <p> Deciding where to live when fledglings leave the nest can both energize and perplex newly free couples . Unlike earlier generations who launched their last child and simply converted a bedroom into a sewing room , today 's parents are thinking expansively - and sometimes expensively . This is their time and their space , they say - a stage of life that signals independence and adventure . <p> Todd Lawson , a Seattle architect and coauthor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ourselves : Reinventing Home Once the Kids Are Grown " ( Taunton Press , $ 35 ) , sees the empty nest as an increasingly distinct stage of life , with more and more options for housing and activities . " People are asking , ' What are we going to do for the next 25 years ? ' " he says . " They 're building and remodeling to suit those needs . " <p> Those needs include home offices , space for entertaining and hobbies , and guest rooms . " Hotel Grandma " is the playful term Mr. Lawson uses to describe the houses of empty-nest parents who are eagerly " preparing for the troops to come home . " <p> Even without grandchildren , empty nesters face important housing decisions . The first is location . " People today are less likely to pull up stakes and move to Arizona to play golf , and more likely to stay put , " Lawson says . " They 've lived their whole life in this neighborhood . Their friends are there . A lot of people are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Another housing decision involves size . Some people downsize so they ca n't have long-term visitors , Lawson says . " Others want to have family and friends stay with them all the time , so they create houses where they do have places to stay . " <p> A third decision focuses on activities - how parents plan to use residential space . " In this time of life , people start spending more and more time away from work , " Lawson says . " Are they going to spend it at home doing hobbies , or are they going to travel ? " <p> For many couples , this may be the first time in their marriage that they have both been home together without the children . " That takes some adjusting , " Lawson cautions . " They have to have spaces to be together and separate . " A home office becomes even more important for those who are retired , because they have no office to go to . <p> Let the house spread its wings <p> One of Lawson 's favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and houseguests can go to the end of the hall and shut the door , then come back for dinner . <p> Empty nesters must also consider maintenance . Some want a huge yard , Lawson finds , while others prefer to spend their time in different ways . <p> Yardwork was one factor influencing the Sullivans ' decision to buy a condo . " We 'd sit on our deck in Holliston and look at the ample yard , " Sullivan says . " When the kids were running around , it was a treasure . But it became a burden . The only time we set foot on it was to mow it or rake it . There 's something wrong with that . " <p> Moving to a suburban condo was the couple 's second choice . " We always thought we would buy a place on a lake , " Sullivan says . Then her mother needed help , so they stayed in the area . That emphasis on family has produced its own rewards . <p> " We 're the classic sandwich generation , " Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can with your parents , and also spend time with your kids . " <p> Do we stay close or move far away ? <p> Proximity to grown children also shaped John and Cynthia Ruhaak 's decisions . Seven years ago , after their younger daughter went off to college , the couple did " a lot of thinking and searching " about where to live in retirement . <p> " We love the outdoors , " Mrs. Ruhaak says , explaining that they often backpacked in the West . They considered moving there , but changed their minds after asking themselves hard questions : " What about the commute from the place we love , which is the Midwest ? And what about our children , who may or may not have the money or the time to come visit ? " <p> They eventually bought 10 acres of farmland in northern Indiana , just 70 minutes from their small apartment in Chicago . <p> " We walked onto the property and knew , " she says . They talked to eight architects and as many contractors , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architect and builder , we knew almost immediately that these were the people we wanted to work with . " <p> The resulting 2,500-square-foot house is a model of Shaker-style simplicity . " There is enormous privacy , " Ruhaak says . The kitchen features two sinks so everyone can help with cooking and cleanup when the extended family gathers for holidays . <p> Mr. Ruhaak has space for woodworking near the garage , and Mrs. Ruhaak 's weaving studio is in the basement . After decades as a city dweller , she is reveling in weekend gardening and bird-watching . They spend weekdays in Chicago , where she works as an interior designer . <p> For Jay and Ann Dickerson of Lakewood , Colo. , becoming empty nesters nine years ago led to a radical change in their lives - one they had spent 10 years saving for . They sold the four-bedroom tri-level where their son had grown up and bought a 46-foot sailboat . They also quit their jobs . <p> " We just started getting rid of all our stuff , except for things we really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives ' houses , " Mrs. Dickerson says . " It was very cleansing . <p> " We 've always had a philosophy that it 's better to do things than have things , " she says . <p> For 3-1/2 years the couple island-hopped around the Caribbean , living on the sailboat . " I 'm married to Mr. Outdoors , " Dickerson says with a laugh . " He always said the time to do this was the time between children and grandchildren . He was so right , because we have our first grandchild now . " <p> When they returned to Denver - and work - in 1999 , the Dickersons bought a 2,100-square-foot house with two bedrooms , two baths and vaulted ceilings . <p> " We made a conscious decision to keep the house small and not to get a lot of stuff , " Dickerson says . " It 's a perfect empty-nester house . It has really big rooms , but not a lot of them . " With a large kitchen and a great room , it lends itself to entertaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have unexpected consequences , leading couples to wish they had made different choices . Having no space for entertaining counts as one reason the Sullivans regret going from a four-bedroom house to a two-bedroom condo . <p> With six grown children , 12 grandchildren , and three of their parents nearby , they long to host family gatherings . <p> For now , they cook Thanksgiving dinner in their church kitchen and eat it in the church parlor . They also invite church members who would otherwise be alone . <p> Yet their smaller quarters do offer advantages . The Sullivans have reduced their mortgage , an important consideration since he took a pay cut when he left a middle-management position to begin a new career as a chef . <p> " We knew we wanted the carefree lifestyle , " Sullivan says . " We love where we are , on the one hand . On the other hand , if we could just add on to the condo . " <p> Some empty nesters do what Lesslie Giacobbi , a real estate broker in Villa Park , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need as many bedrooms as they had , she says , so they create more living space . That often includes a great room adjoining the kitchen . <p> After Jim and Denny Hoelter 's three children left home , the couple decided to stay in Piedmont , Calif . They were active in the community , had many friends there , and liked the proximity to San Francisco . But their English-style cottage , while long on charm , was short on light and space for entertaining . <p> They expanded the three- bedroom house from 2,400 square feet to about 4,000 square feet . That included quadrupling the size of the kitchen , which had been just 5 feet by 10 feet . <p> French doors in the living room allow them to open up space for a large group . They also converted a pantry into an understairs playroom for their seven grandchildren . <p> Describing the renovated house , Mrs. Hoelter says , " It 's more convenient , more efficient , and brighter . " <p> Some town houses and condominiums offer recreational facilities - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - which appeal to empty nesters . <p> " These are things that give you a sense of camaraderie , " says Kathy Braddock , a real estate consultant in New York " There comes a time in people 's lives when they like the convenience of being pampered a bit . It 's not necessarily more expensive , it 's just different . " <p> Even small decorative details can give satisfaction . Lawson offers an example : " Before , the door handle was chosen to keep the kids out of the bathroom or the cupboards . Now it 's chosen because they 've always wanted to have stainless steel . It 's about design and about adult-centric living as opposed to kid-centric . " <p> Those who bought their house many years ago have watched its value soar . Now they must consider a question empty nesters did not face 20 years ago . " People are asking , ' Is it stupid not to sell ? ' " Ms. Braddock says . " They can not ignore the value of their home as part of their portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home and doing something different . " <p> Whatever choices empty nesters make , some suggest that their plans - and their address - could change again . <p> " It 's a great time of life , " says Sullivan , who still harbors dreams of a lakeside home , complete with enough space to host Thanksgiving dinner . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
