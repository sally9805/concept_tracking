After being deserted by industry , a Southern mill town now finds itself abandoned by government . Welcome to Henderson , North . Carolina , where Bush economics is hitting home . <p> UP AN UNPAVED DRIVEWAY , inside an antebellum house turned job-training center in Soul City , North Carolina , Sam Jefferson is tapping a white-sneakered foot on the floor . He is fidgeting his way through this morning 's " spirit up " seminar , led by an impeccably dressed evangelical woman who is here to elevate the self-esteem of a dozen or so unemployed workers . <p> Jefferson , 48 , was laid off in March from Harriet &; Henderson Yarns , a large family-owned textile company in nearby Henderson that filed for bankruptcy this summer . He had worked there for 30 years , having started while in high school to help put food on his family 's table . A single parent ever since his 14-year-old son was a baby , Jefferson had seen hundreds of his colleagues at the mill pink-slipped over the past two years . But he always figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this recession at least long enough for him to put his two teenagers through college . " This is the first time I 've ever been on unemployment in my life , " says Jefferson . " It does n't feel good at all . " <p> A counselor with the unemployment office suggested Jefferson attend classes at the job-training center  --  if only to keep his morale up . Yesterday 's presentations included a seminar on truck-driving schools and a recruiting talk from a guard at the local prison , one of the area 's largest remaining employers . But Jefferson , a stocky , gregarious , and exceedingly polite man with a mustache and wide smile , does n't think jailhouse work is for him : " Those prisoners got 24/7 to think about how to hurt you . " <p> So now he listens as the " spirit up " presenter , Linda Smith , reads affirmations and encourages the audience to set goals for themselves  --  any goals ( her own : getting laser eye surgery ) . Smith tells people to find their hidden talents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We all know where the economy is right now , " she calls out , " so we need to tap into our skills to have a rich self-worth . Amen ? " Jefferson and his fellow students answer with an embarrassed silence . <p> The lackluster response suggests that , however well-meaning , Smith and the state unemployment officials who invited her here have little but moral encouragement to offer people facing the region 's dismal economic landscape . Only an hour away from the high-tech Raleigh-Durham area , Henderson and surrounding Vance County boast North Carolina 's highest unemployment rate  --  15.5 percent as of last June , double the rate of 1999 . The rest of the state is suffering as well . North Carolina lost 111,000 jobs between January 2001 and February 2003 ; and in the next seven months , an additional 29,000 layoffs were announced , all part of the 3 million jobs lost nationwide since President George W. Bush took office . So many people have applied for jobless benefits that the North Carolina unemployment trust fund went broke twice this year ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to be bailed out with emergency loans from the federal government . <p> " I saw President Bush on TV the other night , " says Jefferson , " and he was saying the economy was getting better . I thought , ' He must not have been to Henderson , North Carolina . ' " <p> WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH ran for president in 2000 , he positioned himself as a new breed of conservative , one who believed in the soft side of government and in compassion for those less fortunate . " As president , I will be committed to the advancement of all Americans , " he said in April 2000 , " including those who struggle . " Aware that Republicans of the Newt Gingrich mold were viewed as too harsh and coldhearted , Bush promised to rally the " armies of compassion " to combat poverty and other social ills . <p> But for all the campaign talk about compassion , Bush has shown little interest in the plight of workers like Jefferson . Last year , as more than a million workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush ignored calls to extend benefits for additional weeks . ( He finally relented in the face of pressure from congressional Democrats and supported the extension late in 2002 . ) And throughout the past three years , the president has pursued an agenda of limiting government assistance for lower-income Americans  --  through a combination of massive tax cuts , frozen appropriations , and wholesale restructuring of the way programs are financed . <p> The policies have n't been the stuff of headlines  --  largely because the administration has worked hard to avoid the kind of negative publicity that plagued Gingrich and Ronald Reagan when they attempted to slash social spending . Nonetheless , the likely outcome is much the same . " The administration 's proposals have probably gotten less attention both because the details are seen as technical and the language used is often reassuring , " says Mark Greenberg , policy director at the nonprofit Center for Law and Social Policy . " Instead of making cuts now , it 's laying the groundwork for future cuts . " <p> Many of the administration 's changes in social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments that make it harder for people in need to get assistance . This spring , for example , the Education Department changed the rules for Pell Grants  --  college funds designed to help students from lower-income working families  --  so fewer people can qualify . The Internal Revenue Service has moved to create new requirements for workers eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit , a credit for low-income workers that is so effective at keeping people off welfare that even many conservative groups praise it . Parents seeking the credit would have to provide extensive documentation  --  such as two years ' worth of school records , to prove that their children actually live with them  --  and would be audited at a substantially higher rate than the country 's millionaires . In yet another proposal , the administration seeks to create more stringent verification procedures for families applying for school lunches , to make sure they are poor enough to receive subsidized food . Research conducted by the Reagan administration found that rather than prevent fraud , such measures tend to force eligible children to drop out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Changes like these do n't stand to save the government a lot of money  --  and , critics say , fiscal responsibility may not be the administration 's chief motive . " Just in terms of domestic spending , Bush has been pretty loose , " says Max Sawicky , an economist with the Economic Policy Institute , pointing out that government spending  --  even without counting homeland security and defense  --  has increased faster under Bush than it did under President Clinton . What the administration wants , Sawicky and other critics say , is to reduce the federal government 's role in helping the needy , but without attracting attention . Like previous Republican administrations , notes David Bradley of the National Community Action Foundation , the Bush White House is committed to rolling back the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society . " But they realize they 've got to take different steps to do it , " he says . " They do it with a smile . " <p> One way Bush has avoided scrutiny of his social policies has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abandon them when it comes to providing funding . Bush pushed hard for Congress to pass the No Child Left Behind education act , highlighting it as a signature accomplishment in this year 's State of the Union address . Yet in his 2003 budget request , he left the program underfunded by $8 billion . Similarly , Bush pledged to create new tax incentives to encourage more donations to charity . " It 's not sufficient to praise charities and community groups , " he said in May 2001 . " We must support them ... both as a public obligation and a personal responsibility . " Yet neither of his tax-cut packages , in 2001 and 2003 , included any incentives for charitable donations . " The language used by the administration has consistently communicated a commitment that one does n't find in the funding proposals , " says Greenberg of the Center for Law and Social Policy . <p> In perhaps one of the most notable contrasts between rhetoric and reality , Bush issued a call to young people to serve the country after the September 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which provides college aid in return for a year or two of community service , pledging to expand the program and to recruit more than 25,000 new volunteers . Young people flocked to AmeriCorps in record numbers ; when the program ran out of funds , Bush sat on the sidelines as Congress refused to authorize $100 million in emergency funding and volunteers were turned away by the thousands . ( He has since asked Congress for a $159 million budget increase for AmeriCorps . ) Where the administration has sought out right cuts , they have often had political overtones , eliminating programs perceived as mushy liberal legacies . For instance , even as unemployment has soared , the White House has proposed cutting $11 billion from the budget of the U.S. Department of Labor  --  the same department that has helped bail out state unemployment funds battered by mass layoffs , including North Carolina 's . The only part of the agency slated to get a boost is the one that investigates union corruption . <p> When it 's politically useful , however , the administration has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even those it intends to slash . In the run-up to the 2002 midterm election , for instance , Housing and Urban Development Secretary Mel Martinez appeared in New Hampshire with GOP Senate candidate John Sununu to announce more than $1.6 million worth of grants to cities in the state from the Community Development Block Grant program , which he called " one of the most successful ways the federal government provides funding for ... communities across the nation . " At the time , Bush was proposing that $1.3 billion be chopped from the program , which provides money for everything from housing rehabs to Meals on Wheels for the elderly . Likewise , in August of last year , a HUD official joined Republican Senate candidate John Thune , who was challenging the incumbent , Democrat Tim Johnson , in a tight race in South Dakota , to announce $8.5 million in grants for the state from the Rural Housing and Economic Development program . The 2003 Bush budget proposed eliminating that program entirely . <p> By itself , none of Bush 's policy changes might amount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the combination of layoffs , a state budget crisis , and the federal government 's shrinking commitment is leaving people with a sense of mounting despair . Dale Fite , the CEO of Harriet &; Henderson , says he 's had to lay off 600 people at the mill in the last two years . Now he 's about to lose his own job once the company wraps up bankruptcy proceedings . " We 're allowing an economic crisis to develop here , " Fite says . " Vance County has 15.5 percent unemployment . The social system just ca n't handle it . The Bush administration does n't get it , and I voted for the man . In retrospect , that was a mistake . " <p> Fite notes bitterly that the job losses in his state have been accelerated by Bush 's trade policy , particularly in the run-up to the war with Iraq . In exchange for the use of foreign military bases and airspace , Bush used his fast-track trade-negotiating authority to allow more cheap textile imports from Turkey and Pakistan , a move that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the workers who lost their jobs at Henderson , Fite notes , were the second or even third generation in their families to work for a company that they thought would be there for the long run . " To see the pain in their faces was hard , " he says . " I feel for the Sam Jeffersons of the world . " <p> EIGHT MILES FROM HENDERSON , Bill Owens turns his Ford Explorer down a rutted , red-dirt road into Key Estates , a development full of brand-new double-wide mobile homes . The developer 's promise to pave the roads never materialized , and the county wo n't do it either , so the ruts just get deeper with each rainstorm . The road is so bone-jarringly bumpy that school buses wo n't drive into the development to pick up kids . Several of the new homes have grass growing up over the front steps ; driveways remain unpaved and windows are boarded up . Throughout Vance County , home foreclosures have become epidemic in recent years , jumping from 58 in 1998 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , " laments Owens as he surveys the wreckage of Key Estates . Rail-thin and energetic in a white shirt still crisp in the Southern heat , Owens is the CEO of Franklin-Vance-Warren Opportunity , the area 's largest private social-service provider . He remembers when unemployment in the county was in the single digits  --  back when companies like Burlington Industries , once the world 's largest textile maker , had factories here . <p> Even when the mills and the tobacco plants provided a job for anyone who wanted one , Vance County was n't a wealthy place . The average spinner at Harriet &; Henderson made $9.05 an hour , but the benefits and the low cost of living made that a pretty good income for workers who did n't even need a high-school diploma . Today , nearly 1 in 6 of Vance County 's 43,000 residents is unemployed ; more than 20 percent live in poverty , as do nearly 30 percent of children . One in five people has no health insurance . Many families still live on old plantation land that has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes and move on  --  not that they 'd want to . People here tend to stick around  --  including Owens , who has been at his agency since 1976 . <p> For the past 38 years , much of the funding for community-action groups like Franklin-Vance-Warren has come from Washington . Federal money helps the organization run homeless shelters , build low-income housing , operate Head Start and after-school programs , and provide job training and weatherization assistance for low-income homeowners  --  a critical service last winter , when North Carolina saw a rash of carbon-monoxide poisoning cases after people tried to heat their homes with charcoal grills . Federal programs also allow Owens to provide emergency financial assistance to the elderly and handicapped ; housing placement for low-income families ; and food , temporary lodging , and job-search services for homeless families . <p> But now , as more people than ever line up at his agency 's doorstep , Owens finds himself struggling to fill the need . People who never thought they 'd be asking for help are turning up at his agency  --  " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Owens notes . Yet the president 's 2004 budget slashes funding for agencies like Franklin-Vance-Warren by nearly 25 percent . Cuts to the Section 8 program , which helps low-income families pay rent , could cause some 1,600 North Carolina families to lose their housing subsidy next year . And Low Income Home Energy Assistance , a popular program that helps the poor and elderly pay their heating bills , has been on the administration 's chopping block for several years ; last year , the White House was pushing an 18 percent cut , backing off only after reports that elderly people around the country were dying from the cold . <p> Owens is also worried about the administration 's sweeping initiative to turn the federal government 's largest social programs  --  from Section 8 housing assistance to food stamps , Head Start , and Medicaid  --  into block grants that would be handed over to the states to administer as they see fit . Supporters say block grants will give states more leeway to experiment with better ways of providing services . But , notes Sharon Parrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and local governments could also shift the money to other areas  --  a particular risk at a time when states and municipalities face funding crises of their own . " Flexibility without funding , " she says , " only gives you flexibility to cut . " <p> What 's more , turning entitlements into block grants often serves as a backdoor way of cutting funding . The current system , where funding increases with need , is actually very effective in coping with crises like North Carolina 's , Parrot notes . Block grants , by contrast , expand only when Congress votes to approve increases , which it rarely does . Welfare , for example , was turned into a block grant in 1996 . It has since lost 12 percent of its funding to inflation and is projected to lose 20 percent by 2007 . Similarly , a block grant that funds childcare vouchers for low-income workers has been frozen since 2002 , and the White House has proposed no new funding for the next five years ; as a result , according to research by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working families will lose access to subsidized child care next year . <p> Grover Norquist , an influential conservative adviser to the Bush administration and head of Americans for Tax Reform , says critics are right to expect cuts . " Liberals fear that over time , block grants would be reduced , " he says . " Conservatives worry that they would n't be . " <p> INSIDE HIS NEAT three-bed-room brick house , with not a single unnecessary light turned on to illuminate the gathering dusk , Sam Jefferson is sitting at his dining-room table leafing through the local community-college catalog . Under a federal program to soften the blow of trade-related job losses , former textile workers like Jefferson are eligible for two years of financial assistance if they go back to school for retraining . <p> But school has never really been Jefferson 's thing . Ever since he turned 18 , he 's gotten up every morning and gone to work at Harriet &; Henderson in one capacity or another , most recently as warehouse manager . He 'd arrive at the crack of dawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved monitoring all the trucks taking cotton to the mills , deciding which truck should go where depending on the yarn to be made . His section had the plant 's second-best safety record  --  he still has the paperwork to prove it , along with letters of recommendation from managers who are now unemployed too . " I was the first one in and the last one out , " he says . " I thought I had the best job of anybody . " <p> Applying for unemployment , and signing his kids up for Medicaid , has been a humiliating experience . " I was the kind of person who never wanted to take help from any kind of organization  --  I used to give to them , in fact , " Jefferson says , pointing to receipts from Easter Seals and the Heart Fund . Now , as he ponders his options and sends out his rsum , Jefferson is cutting costs at home , from his life-insurance policy to the kids ' allowances . <p> Part of Jefferson 's problem is that with two teenagers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $33,000 a year that he was making at the mill . He 's heard that the biotech industry near Raleigh might be promising . " To tell you the truth , I do n't even know what biotech is , " he says , " but those are good-paying jobs . " He has good reason to worry : A recent study by the North Carolina Justice and Community Development Center found that six months after being laid off , former textile workers who did manage to find jobs were making , on average , half what they earned at the mills . <p> Compounding the problem is the fact that North Carolina , like nearly every other state in the union , is struggling with a budget crisis . The state , whose tax code is tied to the federal one , stands to lose $434 million between 2002 and 2004 because of Bush 's tax cuts . And that has meant further cuts in programs like the truck-driving school that Jefferson was hoping to attend . The local community college , suffering from state budget cuts , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overwhelmed with the crush of unemployed people seeking retraining . " The economy is really being torn apart , and you can see it in terms of people 's lives , " says Jane Ball-Groom , the workforce-development director for a regional government agency in Henderson . <p> What really bothers Jefferson , though , is that his 17-year-old daughter , Tiffany , not he , was supposed to head off to college next year . All his work as a single father over the past decade and a half has been devoted to getting his kids a good education . But the $2 billion state budget deficit has resulted in a 62 percent tuition increase at state universities in the past three years . Tiffany would like to go to Winston-Salem State University , where tuition is among the state 's lowest , at $7,000 a year including room and board . Financial aid might get her there  --  but on May 30 , Bush 's Department of Education quietly changed the formula for calculating federal aid eligibility , reducing the amount of assistance available to working families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not need to be repaid , now cover about 40 percent of tuition at a public university , compared with 84 percent in the 1970s . <p> When his daughter asks him what 's going to happen , all Jefferson can tell her right now is , " It does n't look good . " He shakes his head ruefully , thinking about his kids and the future . " They 're wondering what the end is going to be , and so am I. " <p> THE HARRIET &; HENDERSON TEXTILE PLANT HAS LAID OFF 600 WORKERS , ADDING TO THE AREA 'S 15 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE . " THE SOCIAL SYSTEM JUST CA N'T HANDLE IT , " SAYS THE CEO OF THE BANKRUPT MILL . <p> AT 48 , SAM JEFFERSON ( WITH DAUGHTERS TIFFANY AND FRANCINE , SON SAM , AND GRANDCHILDREN ANTAVIOUS , NAKIA , AND TABAIS ) FINDS HIMSELF UNEMPLOYED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE . <p> EVEN DURING THE GOOD YEARS , HENDERSON WAS N'T A WEALTHY PLACE . NOW , 20 PERCENT OF ITS RESIDENTS LIVE IN POVERTY . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ARE ALL OVER VANCE COUNTY . <p> ALMOST EVERY SOCIAL-SERVICE PROGRAM BILL OWENS ' AGENCY RUNS  --  FROM HEAD START TO ENERGY ASSISTANCE  --  IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK . <p> By Stephanie Mencimer <p>
