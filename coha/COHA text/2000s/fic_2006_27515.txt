I come from a family with a lot of dead people . Great-uncle Edisto keeled over with a stroke on a Saturday morning after breakfast last March . Six months later , Great-great-aunt Florentine died-just like that-in the vegetable garden . And , of course , there are all the dead people who rest temporarily downstairs , until they go off to the Snapfinger Cemetery . I 'm related to them , too , Uncle Edisto always told me , " Everybody 's kin , Comfort , " he said . Downstairs at Snowberger 's , my daddy deals with death by misadventure , illness , and natural causes galore . Sometimes I ask him how somebody died . He tells me , then he says , " It 's not how you die that makes the important impression , Comfort ; it 's how you live . Now go live awhile , honey , and let me get back to work . " But I 'm getting ahead of myself . Let me back up . I 'll start with Great-uncle Edisto and last March , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 , the first day of Easter vacation . I had just finished deviling eggs in the upstairs kitchen . Uncle Edisto and I were planning the first picnic of spring . My best friend , Declaration Johnson , would be joining us . I was sitting at the kitchen table , scarfing down my Chocolate Buzz Krispies . Uncle Edisto licked the end of his pencil and scribbled onto the crossword puzzle in the Aurora County News . Daddy and Mama were working . Great-great-aunt Florentine had just sneaked her ritual piece of bacon from the paper-toweled rack by the stove . " I 'm off to the garden , darlin 's ! " she said . " I feel a need to sing to the peas ! " She kissed Great-uncle Edisto 's head . He looked up from his crossword puzzle and sang-to the tune of " Oh ! Susanna " - " Oh , Peas-Anna ! Do n't you cry for me . . . " I laughed with my mouth full of cereal . Aunt Florentine blew me a kiss , then she drifted out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from Mississippi with a Moon Pie on my knee ! " " ' Moon Pie ' ! " said Uncle Edisto , poising his pencil over the crossword puzzle . " That 's it ! Twenty-four across ! " The sky had been clouding up all morning , but I was ignoring all signs of rain . A grumble of thunder brought my dog , Dismay , to the kitchen , where he shoved himself at my feet under the table , pressed his shaggy black body against my legs , and shuddered . " Oh , now , doggie ! " said Great-uncle Edisto , peering under the table at Dismay . " You do n't have to worry about no thunder ! It 's a beautiful day for a pic-a-nic ! " Uncle Edisto was always optimistic . " Yessir , " he said , smiling at me , " a pic-a-nic at Listening Rock should be just about perfect today ! " Then-Craaaack ! went the thunder . Sizzle ! went the lightning . And Boom ! . . . The sky opened wide and rain sheared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbling the kitchen table on his back . " Whoa , doggie ! " called Great-uncle Edisto . He steadied the table as Dismay yelped and tried to get out from under the table and onto me . " Down , Dismay ! " I shouted . Milk sloshed out of my bowl , and I made a mighty push-back in my chair . Dismay 's toenails clawed my legs and his thick coat crammed itself into my nose as my chair tipped sideways with me and Dismay in it . " Umpgh ! " The air left my body . My Snowberger 's baseball cap popped right off my head . And there I was , lying on the kitchen floor with a sixty-five-pound dog in my face . He stuck his shaggy snout into my neck and shivered . An obituary headline flashed into my mind : Local Girl , 10 , Done In by Storm and Petrified Pet ! Into the middle of all this commotion clomped my little sister , Merry , wearing Mama 's high heels and a red slip that pooled around her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as she saw me , her eyebrows popped high and her mouth rounded into a tiny O of surprise . " Dead ! " she said . " No , " I said . I spit out dog hair . It was fine and silky and tasted like the cow pond . " You all right , Comfort ? " Great-uncle Edisto towered over me . He wore fat blue suspenders , and I could smell his old-person-after-shaving smell . " I 'm okay . " My head hurt . My plans were ruined . My dog was overwrought . But other than that , I was fine . " Fumfort ! " chirped Merry . " Move , Dismay ! " I pushed at him , but Dismay was glued to me like Elmer 's . He gave my face three quick licks with his wet tongue , as if to say , Yep , it 's thunder ! Yep , it 's thunder ! ! Yep , it 's thunder ! ! ! Merry turned herself around and stomped out of the kitchen , singing , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , Fumfort dead , Fumfort dead away ! " Downstairs the front doors slammed , and my older brother , Tidings , who had been painting the fence by the front parking lot , yelled , " Attention , all personnel ! Where are the big umbrellas ! I need rain cover ! " Dismay immediately detached himself from me and scuttled for the grand front staircase to find Tidings , who was bigger than I was and who offered more protection . I gazed at the ceiling and took stock of the situation . One : It was raining hard . There went my picnic . Two : Best friend or not , Declaration would not come over in the rain-she did n't like to get wet . There went my plans . Three : I did n't have a three , but if I thought about it long enough , I would . Great-uncle Edisto extended a knobby hand to me and winced as he pulled me to my feet . He gave me my baseball cap , and I used both hands to pull it back onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big girl , " he said . He picked up the newspaper , tucked his pencil behind his ear , and looked out at the downpour . His voice took on a thoughtful tone . " The rain serves us . " Great-uncle Edisto always talked like that . Everything , even death , served us , according to him . Everything had a grand purpose , and there was nothing amiss in the universe ; it was our job to adjust to whatever came our way . I did n't get it . " We can have us some deviled eggs and tuner-fish sandwiches right here in the kitchen , Comfort , " he went on . " Or , we can try another day for that pic-a-nic . " When I did n't answer , he turned his head to find me . " What 's the matter , honey ? " " I 'm disappointed . " I studied my scratched-up legs . " So am I ! " Great-uncle Edisto took a Snowberger 's handkerchief out of his shirt pocket and mopped at his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bumble ! " He did . While we straightened the table and chairs and cleaned up the spilled cereal , Great-uncle Edisto told me about how disappointments can be good things-like the time he thought he 'd planted Abraham Lincoln tomato plants in the garden but found out later they were really Sunsweet cherry tomatoes . He 'd had his heart set on sinking his teeth into those fat Abe Lincoln tomatoes , but then he discovered that he liked the Sunsweets even better-and besides , he could pop a whole Sunsweet into his mouth at once and save his front teeth some wear and tear . " A distinct advantage at my age , " he said . " That does n't help my mood , " I said . The rain pounded so hard on the tin roof , it made a roaring sound inside the kitchen and we had to shout to be heard . " Think of disappointment as a happy little surprise , Comfort . For instance . . . " Great-uncle Edisto pushed his glasses up on his nose and smiled like he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get me a nap . " He was breathing hard . " There 's always something good to come out of disappointment , Comfort . You 'll see . " I could tell by the rhythm and tone of his voice that he was working up to his grand finale : " Open your arms to life ! Let it strut into your heart in all its messy glory ! " " I do n't like messes , " I told him . " I like my plans . " Uncle Edisto patted me on the shoulder and lumbered off to his room . I called Declaration on the kitchen telephone , but her line was busy . I hung up and waited for her to call me , but she did n't , so I tried dialing her six more times . Then I gave up . Tidings slammed the downstairs doors on his way back outside , and Dismay came to find me . We went to my closet to wait for something good to happen . I do my best thinking in the closet . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my back against the wall and my knees under my chin . Dismay sat facing me ( it 's a big closet ) , with his paws touching my bare toes . He panted nervously and his dog saliva drip-drip-dripped onto my feet . " Thunder 's gone , " I said . " You can rest easy , boy . " Dismay was n't sure , but he smiled at me anyway , with those shiny dog eyes . It made me want to hug him , so I did . His tail thump-thump-thumped the floor .
