ONE // Where Birds Don ? t Fly " German engineering , Swiss innovation , American nothing . " // Advertising slogan used on a billboard in South Africa by Daimler to promote its Smart " forfour " compact car // In June 2004 , I was visiting London with my daughter Orly , and one evening we went to see the play Billy Elliot at a theater near Victoria Station . During intermission , I was standing up , stretching my legs in the aisle next to my seat , when a stranger approached and asked me , " Are you Mr. Friedman ? " When I nodded yes , he introduced himself : " My name is Emad Tinawi . I am a Syrian-American working for Booz Allen , " the consulting firm . Tinawi said that while he disagreed with some of the columns I had written , particularly on the Middle East , there was one column he especially liked and still kept . // " Which one ? " I asked with great curiosity . // " The one called ? Where Birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment , I was stumped . I remembered writing that headline , but I couldn ? t remember the column or the dateline . Then he reminded me : It was about the newpost-9/11U.S. consulate in Istanbul , Turkey . For years , the U.S. consulate in Istanbul was headquartered in the Palazzo Corpi , a grand and distinctive old building in the heart of the city ? s bustling business district , jammed between the bazaars , the domed mosques , and the jumble of Ottoman and modern architecture . Built in 1882 , and bought by the U.S. government twenty-five years later , Palazzo Corpi was bordered on three sides by narrow streets and was thoroughly woven into the fabric of Istanbul life . It was an easy place for Turks to get a visa , to peruse the library , or to engage with an American diplomat . // But as part of the general security upgrade for U.S. embassies and consulates in the post-9/11 world , it was decided to close the consulate at Palazzo Corpi , and in June 2003 a new U.S. consulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve miles away from the center of the city . " The new 22-acre facilitynearly 15 times as big as the old consulatewas built on a solid rock hill , " a Federal Times article reported ( April 25 , 2005 ) , adding that " State now requires buildings to have protective walls that are at least 100 feet away from embassies and consulates . Those walls and barriers also must protect against explosions and ramming attacks from vehicles , and they must be difficult to climb . Guard booths are placed at the perimeter of facilities , and windows and doors are bulletproof and resist forced entries . The new buildings are also strong enough to resist most earthquakes and bombs . " // They are also strong enough to deter most visitors , friends , and allies . In fact , when I first set eyes on the new consulate in 2005 , what struck me most was how much it looked like a maximum-security prisonwithout the charm . All that was missing was a moat filled with alligators and a sign that said in big red letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulate in Istanbul . Any sudden movements and you will be shot without warning . all visitors welcome . " // They could have filmed the Turkish prison movie Midnight Express there . // But here ? s a hard truth : Some U.S. diplomats are probably alive today thanks to this fortress . Because on November 20 , 2003 , as President George W. Bush was in London meeting with then prime minister Tony Blair , and about six months after the new U.S. consulate in Istanbul had been opened , Turkish Muslim terrorists detonated truck bombs at the HSBC bank and the British consulate in Istanbul , killing thirty people , including Britain ? s consul general , and wounding at least four hundred others . The bomb-ravaged British mission was just a short walk from the Palazzo Corpi. // One of the terrorists captured after the attack reportedly told Turkish police that his group had wanted to blow up the new U.S. consulate , but when they checked out the facility in Istinye , they found it impregnable . A senior U.S. diplomat in Istanbul told me more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorist said the new U.S. consulate was so secure , " they don ? t let birds fly " there . I never forgot that image : It was so well guarded they don ? t even let birds fly there . . . ( That point was reinforced on July 9 , 2008 , when Turkish police outside the consulate killed three terrorists apparently trying to breach its walls. ) // Tinawi and I swapped impressions about the corrosive impact such security restrictions were having on foreigners ? perceptions of America and on America ? s perceptions of itself . As an Arab-American , he was clearly bothered by this , and he could tell from my column that I was too . Because a place where birds don ? t fly is a place where people don ? t mix , ideas don ? t get sparked , friendships don ? t get forged , stereotypes don ? t get broken , collaboration doesn ? t happen , trust doesn ? t get built , and freedom doesn ? t ring . That is not the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of place we can afford America to be . An America living in a defensive crouch can not fully tap the vast rivers of // idealism , innovation , volunteerism , and philanthropy that still flow through our nation . And it can not play the vital role it has long played for the rest of the worldas a beacon of hope and the country that can always be counted on to lead the world in response to whatever is the most important challenge of the day . We need that Americaand we need to be that America  --  more than ever today . // This is a book about why . // The core argument is very simple : America has a problem and the world has a problem . America ? s problem is that it has lost its way in recent yearspartly because of 9/11 and partly because of the bad habits that we have let build up over the last three decades , bad habits that have weakened our society ? s ability and willingness to take on big challenges . The world also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crowded . That is , global warming , the stunning rise of middle classes all over the world , and rapid population growth have converged in a way that could make our planet dangerously unstable . In particular , the convergence of hot , flat , and crowded is tightening energy supplies , intensifying the extinction of plants and animals , deepening energy poverty , strengthening petrodictatorship , and accelerating climate change . How we address these interwoven global trends will determine a lot about the quality of life on earth in the twenty-first century . // I am convinced that the best way for America to solve its big problem the best way for America to get its " groove " back is for us to take the lead in solving the world ? s big problem . In a world that is getting hot , flat , and crowded , the task of creating the tools , systems , energy sources , and ethics that will allow the planet to grow in cleaner , more sustainable ways is going to be the biggest challenge of our lifetime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we take it on , it will revive America at home , reconnect America abroad , and retool America for tomorrow . America is always at its most powerful and most influential when it is combining innovation and inspiration , wealth-building and dignity-building , the quest for big profits and the tackling of big problems . When we do just one , we are less than the sum of our parts . // When we do both , we are greater than the sum of our partsmuch greater . // But it ? s not just an opportunity , either : it ? s also a test . It ? s a test of whether we are able and willing to lead . Whether you love us or hate us , whether you believe in American power or you don ? t , the convergence of hot , flat , and crowded has created a challenge so daunting that it is impossible to imagine a meaningful solution without America really stepping up . " We are either going to be losers or heroesthere ? s no room anymore for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EcoTech International and one of the best environmental minds in America . // Yes , either we are going to rise to the level of leadership , innovation , and collaboration that is required , or everybody is going to losebig . Just coasting along and doing the same old things is not an option any longer . We need a whole new approach . As they say in Texas : " If all you ever do is all you ? ve ever done , then all you ? ll ever get is all you ever got . " The simple name for the new project I am proposing is " Code Green . " What " red " was to America in the 1950s and 1960sa symbol of the overarching Communist threat , the symbol that was used to mobilize our country to build up its military , its industrial base , its highways , its railroads , ports , and airports , its educational institutions , and its scientific capabilities to lead the world in defense of freedom we need " green " to be for today ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing red with green , President George W. Bush replaced red with " Code Red " and all the other crazy colors of the Department of Homeland Security ? s warning system . It ? s time to scrap them all and move to Code Green . Of course , I am not calling for a return to anti-Communist witch hunts and McCarthyismjust to the seriousness and determination to build a society that can face the overarching threat of our day . For me , going Code Green means making America the World ? s leader in innovating clean power and energy-efficiency systems and inspiring an ethic of conservation toward the natural world , which is increasingly imperiled . We ? re going to need both massive breakthroughs in clean power and a deeper respect for the world ? s forests , oceans , and biodiversity hot spots if we ? re going to thrive in this new age . // The first half of this book is a diagnosis of the unique energy , climate , and biodiversity challenges the world faces . The second half is an argument about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than truthful , though , if I said I think America , as it operates today , is ready for this mission . We are not . Right now , we don ? t have the focus and persistence to take on something really big , where the benefits play out over the long term . But I believe that all that could change with the right leadership local , state , and federalproperly framing how much we have to gain by rising to this moment and how much we have to lose by failing to do so . Americans intuit that we ? re on the wrong track and that we need a course correction , and fast . Indeed , when I think of our situation , I am reminded of the movie The Leopard , based on the novel of the same name by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa . It is set in nineteenth-century Italy , at a time of enormous social , political , and economic turmoil . The main character is the Sicilian prince Don Fabrizio of Salina ( played by Burt Lancaster ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adapt if they want the House of Salina to retain its leadership in a new era , where social forces from below are challenging the traditional power elites . Nevertheless , Prince Salina is bitter and uncompromising " We were the leopards , the lions ; those who take our place will be jackals and sheep . " The wisest advice he gets comes from his nephew Tancredi ( played by Alain Delon ) , who marries a wealthy shopkeeper ? s daughter from the new moneyed middle class , and along the way cautions his uncle : " If we want things to stay as they are , things will have to change . " And so it is with America . The era we are entering will be one of enormous social , political , and economic changedriven in large part from above , from the sky , from Mother Nature . If we want things to stay as they arethat is , if we want to maintain our technological , economic , and moral leadership and a habitable planet , rich with flora and fauna , leopards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sustainable waythings will have to change around here , and fast . //
