Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> Cathey Cadieux earned her associate 's degree in fine art at the American Academy of Art in Chicago , later studying at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco . A resident of Newbury Park , California , she teaches at the California Art Institute , in Westlake Village , and is active in several art organizations , such as the American Society of Portrait Artists , the California Art Club , the Degas Pastel Society , and the Pastel Society of the West Coast . She has won numerous awards for her artwork , including Grand Prize at the 2001 Art Methods &; Materials Show Juried Exhibition for The Challenge . The artist is represented by Dassin Gallery in Los Angeles . <p> Like the artist herself , Cathey Cadieux 's paintings are spiritually centered . " All of God 's creations , whether a person , flower , or landscape , radiate a unique light and energy , " the California artist explains . " Depicting these ethereal qualities is my ultimate goal . " An early aptitude for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic career , and the genre has helped refine Cadieux 's skills , culminating in sensitive interpretations of landscapes and still lifes as well . With pastel as her primary medium , she employs a technique of meticulous layering , which , along with expert draftsmanship , captures the subtle , lifelike details so essential to revealing the spirit of her subjects . <p> Most of Cadieux 's portrait commissions come to her by word-of-mouth . Her first step is to meet with the client and become acquainted with the subject . She spends as much time as necessary observing the subject 's demeanor , paying careful attention to posture and gestures . Setting aside her own ideas about possible poses , Cadieux makes sketches and takes photographs , allowing the subject as much latitude as possible in revealing the most natural and compelling composition . " I 'm looking for a defining characteristic , " says the artist . " The child may come up with ideas for the pose that the parents and I could never have imagined , which makes the portrait all the more an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial meetings , Cadieux discusses her aesthetic objectives and philosophy and asks the clients about the kind of portrait they envision . One of the challenges is to help the clients understand how portraiture differs from the more familiar medium of photography . " I always explain that my goal is to create a painting with the greatest sensitivity , and a painting can convey a subtle expression that a photograph just can not capture in the same way , " she says . " It 's important for the clients to be open-minded because , particularly with a child , the initial concept may not match the subject 's true personality . " Cadieux requires a small , nonrefundable down payment , but the client is under no obligation to buy the finished work . " This frees me to do the best painting , " the artist explains . " The final work may not meet the client 's original idea , but I 've never had a portrait rejected . " <p> For a child 's portrait , Cadieux relies on observational sketches and photographs to develop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and works entirely from life . Usually , she begins by making a 5 ? - x- 7 ? or 8 ? - x- 10 ? charcoal pencil sketch and a separate value study . " I do n't do a detailed drawing , " she emphasizes . " I just map out where the top of the head is in relation to the top of the canvas and figure out the background , silhouette , and value pattern . I look for anything that might be awkward . Often , I 'm combining a few photographs , so I need to be sure everything fits together . " She makes a small color study in pastel if the portrait will be especially complicated , then divides the charcoal pencil sketch into thirds and uses a viewfinder to lay in the design loosely on the final surface , either gray Canson or Art Spectrum Colourfix paper . If the final work is larger than 19 ? x 25 ? , she dry-mounts the pastel paper on 100% cotton-rag , four-ply museum board to prevent buckling . <p> Sometimes Cadieux lays in a watercolor underpainting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out my watercolors and a big brush and paint bold washes to help me relax , " she explains . After the wash dries , she begins laying in the pastel , with which she covers the entire watercolor underpainting . In earlier works in which the underpainting showed through , she noticed that each medium photographed differently , creating areas of contrast she did n't intend . Her other approach for backgrounds is to tone an area with pastel , then use mineral spirits and a brush to make a wash . She never does this on the area for the face , which is typically the center of interest and requires careful attention and detail , but finds it effective for clothing and backgrounds or when she paints en plein air and wants to accelerate the painting process . <p> To achieve an accurate likeness , Cadieux measures every feature of the face and the distances between them . Usually working life-size , she uses these measurements to determine the proportions . " It 's not an exact science , of course , " the artist says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Since Cadieux 's priority is to create a timeless work of art , rather than please the client or adhere to a photograph , she adjusts the features slightly to serve the needs of the painting and also to present the subject in the most flattering light . Although her portrayal never alters a person 's bone structure , she makes minor changes to de-emphasize those features that may not be as attractive as others . She pays special attention to a subject 's hands ; as they are as specific to a person , and often as expressive , as his or her face . <p> To build the forms , Cadieux 's approach is slow and laborious , requiring numerous layers of hard pastels applied with a very light touch in hatched and crosshatched strokes . " The hard pastels , such as Rembrandt , Girault , or Nupastel , allow me to apply very fine marks , " the artist explains . " As I add layers I do n't completely cover the ones underneath , so the colors blend optically . " She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a large , dark area  --  preferring to create a kaleidoscope effect . " The layers provide more vitality than blending , " says Cadieux , " and the pastel seems to float on the surface . Sometimes I 'm holding the pastel so lightly it falls out of my hand . " <p> Characterizing her technique as similar to that of a sculptor , Cadieux explains , " I lay in the tones of the lips , making them a little fuller than they actually are . Then , with flesh-tone pastels , I can put in the shapes that surround the mouth . Slowly , I whittle away at the form with more layers and colors of pastel until I achieve the shape and tone I want . If the foundation is correct , I can just add more detail and development in a gradual process , with minute adjustments . " Cadieux is so effective with this technique that the expression in the portrait often becomes more revealing than the photograph . If she makes a mistake , she simply uses a Kleenex to blot the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigment . " I never ignore mistakes , " the artist stresses . " Even though it 's often a painful decision , I am willing to go back and correct an area . I remember that after I 've signed the painting , people are going to look at it for years to come , and it Ms to be perfect . " <p> When she encounters a particularly troubling problem with a portrait , Cadieux turns to other interests , such as the landscapes and still lifes also in progress in her studio . Active in the California Art Club , she keeps her travel kit ready to go at a moment 's notice and thoroughly enjoys the camaraderie of the artist group and the challenges of plein air painting . Cadieux is also an avid gardener who has created her own version of Monet 's Giverny in her backyard . " Sometimes , nature demands I stop and paint my roses , " she says . Like the portraits , the landscapes and still lifes are distinguished by the life and energy they convey , reflecting the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a need to create portraits with a deep personal significance . Her involvement with a local messianic synagogue prompted a deepening spirituality and what she feels is a calling to create portraits that bridge the beliefs of Judaism and Christianity . " I met people at the synagogue whom I thought were visually striking and would be great subjects in portraits . As I got to know them , each one had a story that seemed to illustrate a religious or spiritual concept , " the artist says . The portraits that resulted incorporate Jewish symbols with themes from the New Testament . " I 'm not trying to impose a doctrine of belief . I 'm simply trying to open up a dialogue in a nonthreatening way , " Cadieux emphasizes . The paintings in this series , including The Challenge , have met with enthusiastic acclaim , and she has begun writing a text to accompany them , hoping they will be assembled into an exhibition or book . <p> With all of her success as an artist , Cadieux has reached a point at which painting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual portraits has brought her work to a new level , uniting her facility with technique with more meaningful content . " I feel compelled to reach out to people in this way , " she says . " These new paintings are my life 's direction . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ashley Meroney , 1994 , pastel , 37 x 26 .
