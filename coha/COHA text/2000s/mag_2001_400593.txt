Your skin chemicals lure blood-sucking insects to their next meal <p> Ah , summer nights ! The heat and humidity mingle with the sweet scent of citronella candles , the blue glow of a bug zapper , and the sticky feel of mosquito repellent . Some unfortunate people need this entire antimosquito arsenal to avoid getting eaten alive , while others hardly attract the pesky creatures at all . <p> Scientists have known for decades that mosquitoes are drawn to carbon dioxide , exhaled in abundance by the animals that hungry mosquitoes favor . Carbon dioxide does n't tell the whole story , though . <p> Mosquitoes , after all , tend to bite people on the arms and legs . " I ca n't imagine that much carbon dioxide coming off of someone 's hand , " says Ulrich R. Bernier , a chemist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) in Gainesville , Fla . " And how often do mosquitoes fly into your mouth or nose ? " <p> Carbon dioxide is clearly important , but the skin must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1968 , ARS scientists discovered that lactic acid , which emanates from human skin , acts as an attractant . Now , Bernier and his colleagues are trying to find other compounds emitted by skin that lure mosquitoes to their meals of blood . Using sensitive analytical techniques , they have catalogued more than 340 candidates . In the lab , the scientists are now offering some of these substances to mosquitoes to gauge their attractiveness . <p> The researchers ' ultimate goal is to develop better bug repellents and traps , a goal made more urgent by the threat of mosquito-borne diseases , says Bernier . Other scientists might also find biochemical , medical , or forensic applications for the results , he says . <p> In the past , testing mosquito attractants required a brave volunteer to place an arm into a cage full of the insects . Luckily , the ARS group learned about 20 years ago that when a person handles glass , a residue that includes mosquito attractants is transferred from the skin . So instead of a live arm , researchers can often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for up to 6 hours . <p> Bernier wanted to find out what 's in that mosquito-tempting residue . To collect samples , he and his colleagues asked volunteers to rub a handful of small glass beads between their palms for several minutes . The researchers then loaded the beads into a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer , a device that separates mixtures of chemicals and identifies each component . <p> The glass beads enable researchers to trap oily skin emanations without capturing a lot of perspiration that would overwhelm the gas chromatograph with water . The technique also minimizes the collection of squalene , a precursor to cholesterol that 's abundant on skin . In this way , the method unmasks the scarcer chemicals , Bernier says . He and his colleagues Matthew M. Booth and Richard A. Yost of the University of Florida in Gainesville described the technique in the Jan. 1 , 1999 Analytical Chemistry . <p> The glass-bead sampling , however , does n't capture the skin 's most volatile components , which simply evaporate . Moreover , many water-soluble molecules do n't show up in the samples because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the researchers would also wrap each volunteer 's arm in a plastic bag and then drew out the humid air for a complementary analysis . <p> With these methods , Bernier and his colleagues have doubled the number of chemicals known to emanate from human skin . One day , more sensitive detection methods could further lengthen the list , he says . <p> " There could be well over 1,000 trace chemicals that I ca n't detect , " he speculates . He and his colleagues present their latest findings in the Feb. 15 Analytical Chemistry . <p> To gauge the mosquitoes ' reaction to chemicals , the researchers use a simple setup that they call an olfactometer . It consists of three clear plastic cages stacked on top of one another , each connected to a pair of cylindrical ports . Screens divide the attractants from the insects . Inside each cage , 75 female mosquitoes wait to be enticed . Only females bite ; they need blood to nourish their developing eggs . <p> During a test , the researchers place potential attractants in the ports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mosquitoes like what they smell , they fly upwind toward the attractant . The researchers then tally the number of insects in the port . <p> To account for differences in mosquito mood , the Gainesville group tests the three cages of mosquitoes in a random order at three different times of the day . " On some days , the mosquitoes do n't respond as well . Other days , they 're very active , " says Bernier . The researchers run many trials and analyze their results statistically . <p> Mosquitoes show the best response to combinations of compounds , and it 's time-consuming to find the right mix of attractants . Bernier winnowed attractants from the list of 346 chemicals by methodically mixing the skin 's most abundant compounds with lactic acid . He has found that a blend of three particular chemicals attracts at least 90 percent of the mosquitoes in the olfactometer every time . Bernier 's own arm and hand usually draw about 70 percent . <p> " It 's a delicate situation , " Bernier says . If the proportions are n't right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , some compounds mask the real attractants , rendering them useless . " If you mix 30 compounds together , the mosquitoes do n't even know the attractant is there , " Bernier says . <p> The group has filed a patent on the blend of three compounds , which Bernier declines to identify . <p> In addition to pure chemicals , Bernier and his colleagues ran tests with skin residue from four people , all USDA employees , who varied in their mosquito appeal . The scent on glass beads handled by the tastiest individual lured 77 percent , while the most repellent person drew only 23 percent of the mosquitoes . <p> Similarly , chemical analysis shows differences between the people . <p> Some smells that repel people lure mosquitoes , it turns out . Several years ago , Willem Takken and his colleagues at Wageningen Agricultural University in the Netherlands found that a species called Anopheles gambiae loves both stinky feet and Limburger cheese . A bacterium used to make Limburger is also found on the human foot , accounting for the similarity in odor , Takken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosquitoes near . <p> ARS entomologist Daniel L. Kline tested the attractiveness of his own feet to mosquitoes in the lab and outdoors . He wore the same pair of socks 12 hours each day for 3 days . Alone , the socks did not draw many mosquitoes . When combined with carbon dioxide , however , the socks lured many mosquitoes , including disease-carrying species . <p> The researchers have never observed an attractant to draw 100 percent of the mosquitoes in the olfactometer , Bernier says , although recently one blend came close . The last mosquito began flying toward the attractant but made a U-turn at the last second and flew back into the cage . <p> Acombination of compounds that can beat out the scent of a person could lead to better mosquito traps . In many parts of the world , mosquitoes transmit diseases such as malaria , West Nile fever ( SN : 12/11/99 , p. 378 ) , and encephalitis . <p> The Gainesville group always works with Aedes aegypti , also known as the yellow fever mosquito , because it 's an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite anytime . " <p> Other species , such as the malaria-carrying Anopheles quadrimaculatus , turn up their noses  --  or proboscises , rather  --  at human scents in the lab . <p> It 's still too early to know whether the findings will yield useful products . To lure mosquitoes to a trap , an attractant must offer more appeal than the people nearby , which is a tall order to fill . " It 's very hard to approximate the human body . We do n't know enough yet , " says Bernier . <p> Although by themselves some of the blends attract more mosquitoes than Bernier 's arm , if both an arm and a blend are presented at the same time , the arm wins hands down . <p> However , if the researchers add a masking compound to the port with the human hand , the mosquitoes fly over to the port with the chemical blend . Perhaps a masking chemical could make a person less appealing than a nearby attractant baited trap . <p> It will be difficult to find something to compete with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 4/27/96 , p. 270 ) . " There 's a push for natural repellents , but nothing compares to DEET in duration and effectiveness right now , " Bernier says . " We 're trying . " <p> DEET is a contact repellent , so the mosquito has to land on the chemical for it to work . A repellent that acts while in the air would be desirable but is " a lot harder to come up with , " says Bernier . <p> Another problem with DEET is that it does n't work well against all mosquito species , Bernier notes . And although DEET is considered safe , some concerns linger about its effects on people ( SN : 11/30/96 , p. 347 ) . Repellents based on naturally occurring compounds could minimize those fears , Bernier says . <p> The researchers ' results have suggested some futuristic applications . The catalog of skin emanations could provide new ways to analyze criminal evidence , for instance . Chemicals in people 's fingerprints seem to vary . Identifying prints ' components could contribute information about the people involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical setting , the skin chemicals might give useful clues about health problems and drug use . <p> Bernier , however , focuses on insect control . One day , he says , people may be able to take a pill that acts as a " systemic repellent " by altering the compounds given off by skin . The pill could cut back the production of attractive compounds or step up the production of ones that mask an enticing scent . <p> People then could stroll around with their own antimosquito force fields . They could turn off the bug zapper , snuff out the citronella candles , throw out the sprays , and just enjoy the summer nights . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A female yellow fever mosquito probes a piece of Limburger cheese , one of few known mosquito attractants . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Glass beads pick up scents after being handled .
