A Mother 's Days Headnote How a mom who 'd dreamed of dainty daughters came to appreciate the squishy side of sons BY JULIE BROWN // IN HINDSIGHT , I 'D HAVE TO ADMIT that I was a rather prissy little girl . I was sweet and shy around adults , polite and well behaved at school , whiny and sullen when I did n't get my way . My girlfriends and I filled our days with Barbies and babies and imaginary boyfriends . We had a chest full of old gowns that turned us into princesses and magical fairies . We spent hours at my dollhouse , carefully arranging the furniture and setting the table with tiny dishes for dinner parties . We played outdoors and even at times consented to getting our hands soiled . But anything typically " boy " - bugs , belching , and bathroom talk-was regarded as offensive . I grew up to be a somewhat prissy woman and thought that I was destined to give birth only to girls . Indeed , I really wanted only girls . I looked forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt I could n't even raise boys properly . And then I gave birth to two of them . No Laura Ashley wallpaper , frilly pink dresses , or games of beauty shop for me . I had to play with trucks , not dollhouses , and get dirty , not dressed up . As luck would have it , my sons turned out to be , as my mother called them , " all boy . " They did n't play in the mud ; they bathed in it . They did n't merely wrestle ; they pummeled each other . And though I outlawed toy guns , anything that even remotely resembled a firearm became one . Challenging though it was , I had no choice but to adapt . Eventually I got used to the dirt , the noise , the roughhousing , and the endless fascination with bodily functions . I became respectably accomplished at throwing and catching and developed a pretty mean hook shot , nothing but net . But I drew the line at things that were gross . I had to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dirty things . Then , when my older boy , Mickey , turned 6 , we had a science birthday party that , at his insistence and his father 's doing , included a worm farm . The two of them went to the bait shop to buy two dozen night crawlers , which were unloaded into a big rub of dirt . Ten minutes into the party , one of Mickey 's friends came to me complaining that Sammy , my 3-year  --  old , had removed some of the worms . " Sammy , " I said . " Put the worms back . " " I ca n't get " em , " he said . " Why ? Where are they ? " " My pocket . " " Well , pull them out right now , " I demanded . " I ca n't . They too squishy . " What could I do ? The party must go on . Kids were whining for worms . I held my breath . I reached deep down into his pocket . I wrapped my hand around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My head spun for a second , but I did n't get sick . I just looked at the dozen giant worms squirming around and sliding through my fingers . Then I dropped them into the bucket and watched as they separated and burrowed their way down under the dirt . After the party was over , I tossed all the worms into the garden . When Sammy came out late that afternoon , up from a much-needed nap , he wanted to play with the worm farm again . " Where the worms , Mommy ? Sammy want worms , " he said . " Mommy put them in the garden , honey , " I explained . " They 're good for the plants . " " They my worms . I want worms ! " " Okay , " I said , sympathetic that most of the attention that day had been directed at his brother . " I know where they are . Let 's go dig them up . " We marched off with our shovels and dug until we 'd found at least ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dirt and put the worms in . Together we plucked them out and let them slither around in our hands and through our fingers . At that very moment , as Sammy and I sat there playing with worms , my fingernails blackened with dirt , I felt thoroughly content . I would n't have traded that wormy moment with my son for anything , even my longed  --  for tea parties and Mary Janes . Not long after the squishy-worm incident , I was outside gardening by myself when I heard a quiet shuffling in the bushes . I knew it could be only one thing-a lizard . I crouched down and waited patiently . There it was , small and brownish , scampering into the leaves . I reached out and grabbed it by its tail . I held it up high and watched it wiggle around , trying to escape . Suddenly , the lizard dropped back into the dirt and disappeared . I was left holding half of its tail . Cool ! I thought . I ca n't wait to show Sammy and Mickey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Center for Missing &; Exploited Children . // <p>
