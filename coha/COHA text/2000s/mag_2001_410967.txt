<p> It gave us the Internet and the mouse . Today , the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency remains a powerful engine driving technological change . <p> NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT HAD EVER BEEN ATTEMPTED . DEEP IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT LAST MARCH , AS A FEW FATIGUES-CLAD U.S. MARINES STOOD NEARBY , RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA , BERKELEY , FIDDLED WITH A 1.5-METER AIRPLANE WITH SIX WALNUT-SIZED BUNDLES OF ELECTRONICS ATTACHED TO THE UNDERSIDES OF ITS WINGS . EACH BUNDLE , SWADDLED IN PINK PLASTIC , HELD A MAGNETIC-FIELD SENSOR , SHORT-RANGE RADIO TRANSMITTER , ANTENNA AND MICROPROCESSOR RUN BY A CUSTOM LOW-POWERED OPERATING SYSTEM DUBBED " TINY OS . " <p> And then the remote-controlled plane , freighted with the early embodiments of a hoped-for advance in miniaturized , networked sensing , buzzed aloft , traveled about two kilometers and dropped its pink payload along a dirt road . Soon , as planned , a few trucks drove past the innocuous electronic spies . The bundles detected the trucks ' magnetic fields , shared this information among themselves and beamed a report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote-controlled plane circling overhead . The aircraft , in turn , relayed the news to the researchers and soldiers waiting on the rugged terrain of the Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms , CA . <p> The bundles were crude prototypes , and it took days to get even this limited experiment right . But someday thousands of similar devices  --  only much tinier , perhaps as small as dust motes  --  might be deployed to collect and process a rich array of information about enemy movements , crop conditions , pollution or anything else requiring monitoring . Realizing such a vision will demand advances in everything from microscale sensors to materials to programming . It 's a huge undertaking . But there 's a common benefactor : the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which brokered the desert experiment and is funding ambitious investigations into each of the technologies involved . <p> Commonly known as DARPA , this is the U.S. Department of Defense 's storied outpost of technology research  --  military systems , yes , but also innovations that sometimes create and transform industries . Formed in 1958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's launch of its Sputnik satellite , DARPA boasts a four-decade-long history of promoting novel technologies  --  today doling out nearly $2 billion annually to corporate , government and university researchers in support of high-risk , potentially high-impact ideas . Among its many successes ( see " Four Decades of Success , " p. 45 ) , DARPA 's gambles proved instrumental in spawning the Internet and the computer mouse , stealth aircraft and the chip that makes your cell phone work  --  advances that meant research as out-of-the-box in its time as dust-mote-sized sensors seem today . <p> DARPA is hardly the only player funding cutting-edge research  --  think National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health  --  and certainly not the deepest pocketed . But the agency 's swashbuckling style of betting on seemingly far-out research  --  and bringing together interdisciplinary teams that it pushes toward a practical advance-sets it apart . And while some contend that DARPA has moved back from the cutting edge in recent years , concentrating too much on short-term military issues rather than truly breakthrough ideas , no one denies that the agency remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the good stuff we have today is there because DARPA was willing to take a chance on visionary projects , " says David Waltz , president of the NEC Research Institute in Princeton , NJ . " They are the visionary agency . " MUNDANE POWERHOUSE <p> In its physical aspect , DARPA is nothing if not mundane . The critical decisions that agency officials make on exotic technologies are rendered in an unremarkable leased office building in Arlington , VA . There are no labs here ; DARPA is a funding agency , not a research facility . No sign advertises DARPA 's tenancy to passersby . Except for the anti-eavesdropping gadgets glued to its conference-room windows , this edifice of black-hued glass could pass for an insurance company . But once in the lobby , newcomers must submit their social security numbers to " Visitor Control . " Guards ask , " classified or unclassified ? " and make sure guests stay in sight ( around here , it 's a no-no to wander into a hallway in search of the water cooler , and telephones bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices are filled with about 240 employees , of whom half are technical staff  --  program managers whose job is to shape the work DARPA funds and scour the country for promising new ideas . In keeping with DARPA 's antibureaucratic ethos , these managers are not career government employees but experts on loan from universities , corporations and federal research labs , pulling stints at DARPA of between three and five years . " DARPA is the Department of Defense 's center for revolutionary ideas . It is a true bottom-up organization where program managers are the heart and soul , " says Anthony J. Tether , the agency 's director . " We hire people who have a dream that they can not get fulfilled elsewhere .... DARPA program managers are by nature risktakers ; they are passionate about making a difference . " <p> It is in the arena of emerging technologies  --  funding for research makes up 56 percent of the agency 's $2.2 billion 2002 budget  --  that the greatest triumphs have come . And a look at the agency 's current lineup shows plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA was an early founder of efforts to produce miniature mirrors , sensors and gauges  --  devices used in so-called microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS )  --  that are now widely employed in industry . Want tiny , low-powered computers ? DARPA is backing work on logic and memory components as small as individual molecules . Want thousands of sensors ( or little robots ) to synthesize observations and coordinate actions ? DARPA is funding the networking technologies and software they 'll need . Want something to quickly detect tiny amounts of viruses and other pathogens ? DARPA is working on that , too , and a lot more . <p> It all adds up to a diverse panoply of projects , but the principle on which they are chosen is the same : " We 're about surprise . Prevent surprise , and create surprise , " says Jane Alexander , the agency 's deputy director . " You need a skunk works , somebody over in the corner who is anticipating what your opponent is doing and what you are going to answer that with , and also is anticipating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surprise somebody with . DARPA is that thing . " <p> But the key to the agency 's success lies not so much in its mission as in its unique administrative model and management philosophy . For starters , before DARPA officials even decide what to fund , " one of the questions senior management asks is , Is somebody else able to do this problem ? ' If they are , let them do it , " says Alexander . And if not , DARPA primes the pump  --  providing enough time and money for the technology to take root in the commercial world . " With the right investment at the right time , I can steer industry toward an area that will be useful . I nudge them . " <p> These are multimillion-dollar nudges , of course , so the aim is to choose carefully . After hearing from the military about its near- and long-term needs , DARPA 's program managers design multidisciplinary programs to help meet them . Major initiatives  --  or " thrusts "  --  usually last four years and incorporate five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $40 million , and occasionally much more . Whatever the scale , though , DARPA stresses teamwork among research groups and enforces short-term performance milestones . And then , just as feverishly as DARPA begins a thrust , it often pulls out . Either the teams are unable to meet their goals , or they succeed sufficiently that the commercial sector or other research-funding sources pick up the ball . Alex Roland , a Duke University professor of military and technology history , says 85 percent of the agency 's programs fail . " It 's not an aspect of what they do that they want publicly displayed . " Roland says . However , he adds , " You 've got to expect a high rate of failure because the payoffs are fabulous . " <p> So where will the next big successes come from ? TR canvassed DARPA directors to identify today 's hottest research projects . There 's no guarantee any will pan out . But together they provide a representative look at the agency 's most cutting-edge initiatives  --  and the direction technology is heading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research have evolved into one of DARPA 's most intriguing new areas of focus . One was the air force 's ongoing quest for stronger , lighter materials to build better planes . The second exploded into view after the Persian Gulf War . During the conflict , United States-led forces used shells made of radioactive uranium-238 to attack Iraqi tanks . Instead of flattening on impact , uranium-238 peels away in layers and actually sharpens , making it more destructive than conventional shells . But some veterans ' groups soon claimed the radioactive residue caused health problems . Plus there was an expensive environmental cleanup required . All this led the army to seek a nonradioactive replacement for its uranium projectiles . <p> In the mid-1990s , these parallel needs led DARPA to the Galtech lab of William L. Johnson , a pioneer in a field known as " glassy metals . " Such materials look like ordinary metals , but they have a key difference : they 've been fabricated so their atomic structures are n't orderly , or " crystalline , " but rather random or " amorphous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scientists have known for at least a decade that a random atomic structure in a metal alloy can confer greater strength and more resistance to fracture and corrosion than are provided by crystalline structures , which contain more defects that make for weakness than amorphous structures . The problem is , glassy metals are extremely difficult and expensive to produce . In most cases , therefore , they have only existed as laboratory curiosities ( an exception is Johnson 's glassy zirconium-beryllium alloy , now used in high-end golf dubs ) . But working under army sponsorship , Johnson 's lab in 1997 came up with a glassy tungsten that not only self-sharpened  --  making it a potential replacement for uranium shells  --  but pointed the way to techniques for mass-producing glassy metals with broader applications . <p> Looking to direct more firepower into this potential breakthrough area , DARPA this spring began a four-year , $30 million thrust to fund efforts to model the atomic interactions that take place as metals are mixed and cooled . The hope is that this insight will lead to glassy versions of widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be fabricated by the ton in existing factories . The first glassy metals were discovered " by trial and error , by happenstance , some might even say alchemy , ' says Leo Christodoulou , DARPAs manager of the new program , called Structural Amorphous Metals . " What we are trying to do is put more science behind this program , try to understand the fundamental physics . " <p> DARPA 's effort attacks the problem from several different angles . For starters , a team led by Johnson that includes seven university labs and three military research groups will do the underlying scientific studies and computational work and create new samples . The prototype materials will then be passed to industrial partners for small-scale fabrication and testing . ( As of mid-August , the partner companies had not been announced . ) <p> Whether any fundamentally new , factory-ready-metals recipes will emerge from this collaboration is an open question . But the potential payoff is clear : Johnson 's group , for instance , is working on glassy aluminum and magnesium alloys that would possess twice the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be needed to , say , build a fighter jet or a 747 , enabling it to save fuel or carry heavier payloads . " If we can successfully do this , then this is the material aircraft will be built out of in 15 years , " Johnson says . " It will become a major paradigm shift in the way we use metals . " BIO:INFO:MICRO <p> The fusion of computing with other fields has become a given in recent years . The combination of computers and communications forms the basis of the Internet . The application of computing power to drug development has spurred bioinformatics and other , related areas of genomics and proteomics . In DARPA 's view , the next challenge will be linking biology and computing to the science of the very small , through devices that can detect , influence , interpret and communicate what 's happening in living cells . And so DARPA this year kicked off an ambitious $35 million , four-year effort called Bio:Info:Micro . As Alexander told a group of researchers last fall , there 's a growing sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and revolutionary . In a lot of cases , we ca n't quite put our finger on it , but all of us , as technologists , think that this is a very promising area . " <p> Two basic programs aim to fire early salvos in this predicted revolution . The first attempts to advance brain-machine interfaces  --  technologies that tap brain signals to control a variety of mechanical and electrical devices and can also send signals into the brain to stimulate neurons . This program has a solid starting point : already , DARPA-funded groups from Duke University , Caltech and elsewhere have built devices ( tested only on animals so far ) that can be surgically implanted in the brain to detect neural signals and send those impulses via wires to computers . The computers decode the signals , then transmit control instructions to devices like robotic arms ( see " Brain-Machine Interface , " TR January/February 2001 ) . <p> Linking brains to robotic arms is an awe-inspiring feat . But every component and process in these early systems needs loads of work And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have demonstrated the feasibility of direct communication with the brain , " says Daryl Kipke , an associate professor of bio-engineering at the University of Michigan who is leading one of three DARPA-funded university teams working on brain-machine interfaces . Now , he says , the challenge is to vastly improve this communication with help from the thrust 's three basic disciplines . Kipke 's team will work to improve existing MEMS implants , adding a microfluidic device to deliver drugs to the implant site . Biologists will seek to identify which molecules should be used to make neurons grow , stay healthy and not form scar tissue . And finally , computer scientists are improving brain-data processing . <p> If such systems ever get perfected , they could enable direct nervous-system control of prosthetic limbs , and even the realization of visions like mind-controlled mechanical " exoskeletons " that enable troops to exceed the limits of their normal strength and endurance , says Alan Rudolph , manager of DARPA programs developing robots based on biological designs . " The ability to have direct brain-to-machine links , " he notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with all manner of complex systems . " <p> The second part of DARPA 's Bio:Info:Micro program funds fundamental research aimed at advancing the understanding and control of one of life 's most elemental components  --  the communication network within a cell . A collaboration at MIT , one of three universities where DARPA is funding such studies , includes an engineer aiming to perfect microfluidic devices that can quickly measure thousands of protein interactions , a biologist extracting the cellular proteins needed to detect these interactions  --  and computer scientists developing algorithms to make sense of the torrent of data that should result . While DARPA is n't the only group supporting these kinds of initiatives , " I 'm not aware of other funding agencies ... trying to advance all three of them simultaneously , " says Douglas A. Lauffenburger , codirector of MIT 's Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Health and leader of DARPA 's Bio:Info:Micro team at MIT . <p> The work could point the way toward extremely sensitive sensors for detecting disease in the body or chemicals in the environment . It could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots to software  --  modeled after the extraordinary adaptability and ruggedness of ordinary cells . " Cells are designed to carry out very robust , reliable , simple sets of behaviors under highly variable , unpredictable conditions , " says Lauffenburger . But the research is so fundamental , he adds , it 's hard to predict what the first payoff might be . AUTOMA-TEAMS <p> In a major report last year , the Joint Chiefs of Staff made dear their hope that robots would soon handle war 's most dangerous tasks . Drone bombers would make early strikes . Robots would dear mines and even fire weapons . Tiny sensor-bots would spy on the enemy and look for evidence of chemical and biological weapons . But to realize this vision , the military needs a way to safely and reliably coordinate and control a robotic fleet that could number in the tens of thousands . It 's a mind-boggling command and control problem , says Sharon Heise , a program manager in DARPA 's Information Technology Office . " But the payoff is enormous if we can get it done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a four-year , $65 million thrust called Mixed Initiative Control of Automa-Teams . The agency says the time is right for such a sweeping effort  --  uniting researchers in robotics , artificial intelligence and computer programming . Indeed , increasingly sophisticated robots for everything from mine clearing to air warfare have traveled far down the prototype pipeline , including a Boeing-built , DARPA-funded unmanned bomber that took its first flight test this summer . But many robots have been more impressive in their mechanics than in their software and control systems . <p> The DARPA effort is so new that as of August no contractors had been named . But Heise does n't need to issue contracts to know the immensity of the problem . The software required to control just one unmanned bomber is complex enough , she notes , integrating sensor data on parameters like wind speed , velocity and pitch , and then making a blaze of calculations and sending operating instructions to wing flaps , engines and bomb bay doors . " Now imagine expanding that to a number of vehicles . Now network those vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control those vehicles to a target ? ... the scaling happens so rapidly that it is very difficult to quantify . " <p> DARPA 's program does n't seek to immediately provide all the answers  --  but rather to develop underlying theories of how to attack the problem . Explains Heise , " Those theories are implemented in fundamental mathematical algorithms , which are implemented in software and then demonstrated through modeling . " DARPA expects this small-scale demonstration by 2005 . <p> In many ways , the Automa-Teams project also gets to the heart of one of the most daunting issues in computing . That is , programming the actions of the thousands , if not millions , of massively distributed and often interconnected sensors and computer systems that will soon permeate everything from cell phones to cars to machinery to appliances . Already DARPA supports about a dozen programs in this " embedded computing " arena , of which Automa-Teams is just the latest . " Embedded computing is perhaps the biggest impact area of computing because it literally changes the physical environment around us , " says Janos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Office . " It 's a completely new software technology . That is where it gets quite exciting . " PLAYING FAVORITES <p> There 's no disputing DARPA 's past success or current ambition , but the agency is not without its critics . One complaint is that DARPA seems to disproportionately award its grants to a small universe of major universities , corporations and researchers . " I 've heard complaints that DARPA plays favorites both with people that it chooses for projects and the companies it selects as contractors . It 's hard to break into the club , " says NEC 'S Waltz . Another gripe , Waltz notes , is that DARPA managers can be a bit controlling and unreasonable . " DARPA , when they give you money , they feel they own your life . They call a meeting and expect you to drop everything and come and be prepared . " <p> Waltz thinks such faults are forgivable in light of DARPA 's historical output . But a more consistent  --  and fundamental  --  concern is that the agency has developed a shorter-term focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARPA from the mid-1990s on is their telescope receded from distant galaxies to the nearby planets , " says Kenneth Flamm , a Clinton-era Department of Defense official overseeing technology policy who now teaches at the University of Texas at Austin . During the Clinton administration , Flamm says , DARPA acceded to " pressure to show more military relevance . " <p> Whether the Bush administration , with its emphasis on missile defense , cares to swing the pendulum toward more generic research remains to be seen . The challenge for DARPA , of course , is to promote technology 's grandest dreams and show military relevance . Indeed , that 's what was happening last March at the Marine Corps proving grounds , where Berkeley researchers demonstrated their walnut-sized electronic spies . <p> Six months later , the Berkeley group had almost finished building electronic bundles just one cubic millimeter in size  --  well on their way to creating the envisioned " smart dust " that could both help the military and revolutionize commercial monitoring and sensing . " Given where technology is headed , there is no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Kris Pister , associate professor of electrical engineering at Berkeley . However , he adds , DARPA accelerates that process by promoting emerging technologies that are blue sky  --  but requiring them to fly in the desert sky . <p> Join an online discussion of this article at **36;877;TOOLONG Four Decades of Success <p> Because many of the early-stage projects DARPA backs are also funded by other sources , crediting DARPA with specific breakthroughs is often difficult . But here are some key technology successes of the agency , which was known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) from 1958 to ' 72 and 1993 to ' 96 , and DARPA from 1973 to ' 93 and 1996 to the present .

Dertouzos Director , MIT Laboratory for Computer Science <p> I HAVE OBSERVED THE AGENCY 'S ACTIVITIES since 1963 , first as a researcher and since 1974 as director of MIT 'S Laboratory for Computer Science . Now new leadership is taking over the agency . Here is an interesting question that may help them in their future plans : " What has been DARPA 'S return on investment in information technology ? " <p> Over the first couple of decades of its existence , the agency invested some one billion of today 's dollars in computer science and IT research . The return on that investment has included time-shared computers , packet radio and the early steps of the Ethernet , the ARPAnet and its successor the Internet , which made possible the World Wide Web , major advances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other key contributions in computer science and AI . By my reckoning , DARPA has been responsible for about one-half of the major innovations that have made information technology what it is today . And since IT economic activity around the globe today amounts to some two trillion dollars a year , we conclude that DARPA 'S return on investment has been around 1,000 to one , or in business terms 100,000 percent ! <p> It 's surprising how many people , especially in government , are unaware of how stellar this record has been , and underestimate DARPA 'S contribution to U.S. leadership worldwide  --  a position largely due to this nation 's primacy in computers and information technology . Somehow , people still think of information technology as only a tool rather than as a principal strategic and economic asset that should be protected and enhanced . This mindset has even penetrated DARPA , which has begun reducing research in basic information technology , focusing instead on promising military applications of computers . The agency 's previous leadership and Congress have concluded that they need not worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more generic future IT research . <p> That is a pipe dream : take , for example , the development of a radically new operating system that would increase human productivity three to one , by making machines serve people rather than the other way around . It is against the interests of large software manufacturers to pursue such a research-and-development endeavor . They 'd rather upgrade their systems incrementally so as to preserve a steady revenue stream from a huge base of existing customers . By doing so , they inadvertently exacerbate the complexity and difficulty of using these systems . A radically new approach could help all computer users in a big way , and could even save the U.S. Department of Defense tens of billion of dollars a year , through easier , more productive use of its many computer systems . <p> This kind of radical research is old hat to the DARPA community , whose " secret " success formula has been to tackle imaginative , high-risk research projects with a minimum of bureaucratic overhead and delays , while giving a great deal of latitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major innovations that came out of this proven approach have been on basic IT topics , and have helped military and commercial uses equally . <p> Information technology is still young and will continue to grow during the 21st century . Achieving a big return on investment through fundamental advances in the field is still in the cards . I urge the agency 's new leadership to make basic IT a kingpin of future DARPA research within a well-balanced program of research and applications , and to reinstate the proven DARPA way of carrying out that research . This will go a long way toward enhancing U.S. military and economic leadership through information technology . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Michael L. Dertouzos <p>
