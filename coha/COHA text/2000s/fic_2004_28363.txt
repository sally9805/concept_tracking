To Paradise Amoy to Aavana ( 1857 ) There were other men like Chen Pan on the ship , not too young , but not too old either . From the farms , mostly , as far as he could tell . No weaklings . Cuba , the man in the Western suit had told him , needed sturdy workers . Chen Pan was taller than most of the recruits , and his arms were taut with muscles . His hair was tied back in a thick queue , but at twenty years old he barely needed to shave . A few families came to see their men off . The women gave their husbands sticky rice balls and packets of seeds for their journey . There was no weeping . Even the smallest children were dry-eyed . Most of the men , like Chen Pan , went aboard alone and empty-handed . That evening at sea , the coast of China gradually faded behind them . A haloed moon rose on a swell of wind , but this hopeful omen did n't alter the facts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irons and grates . The recruits were kept belowdecks , like animals in a pen . The shortest among them could n't stand upright . Soon Chen Pan 's neck ached from stooping . Neither the British captain nor his crew spoke much Chinese . The captain issued his orders with a flat expression and a wave of his girlish hands . His crew was far more unruly . They threatened the recruits with muskets and cutlasses and rattan rods , shackled those whom the rods did n't tame . Chen Pan was struck with a hoisting rope for requesting an extra blanket . Those men who 'd brought food or tobacco on board began to barter and sell . These boiled chicken feet for your hemp sandals or your uncle 's flute . A handful of pumpkin seeds for your stash of turnips or hard-boiled eggs . A day 's opium for thewoolen gloves . Gambling sprouted like snake-grass in every bunk . The incessant clicking of dice finely divided the hours . A man from W gathered most of the winnings and crowed , " If you were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ! " After his misfortunes in Amoy , Chen Pan refused to gamble . He guarded his Mexican coins , tucking them between the meager cheeks of his buttocks for safekeeping . The men got beef jerky and rice gruel to eat . Chen Pan ate , although the taste of the food sickened him . It was oversalted , and the lack of adequate water made him desperately thirsty . Hour after hour , he thought more of his shoe-leather throat than of the life awaiting him in Cuba . Those who demanded more water were answered with blows . Chen Pan watched men drink their own urine , lick moisture from the walls of the ship . A few swallowed seawater until their stomachs swelled and they choked in their own filth . A squat melon-grower from T announced that he would throw himself into the ocean to end his torment . Chen Pan crept on deck with two others to watch him jump . The melon-grower did n't shout or linger but simply stepped into the breeze . A moment later , the furling waves received him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelor . No destiny would be altered but his . The ship continued to plow south into the hard-gusting wind . Chen Pan covered his ears so they would n't blow away altogether . He asked himself four questions : What was the last sound the melon-grower heard ? The last color he saw before he died ? How long would it take for the fish to devour him ? Would this death complete his fate ? " Show me the person who does n't die , " shrugged a short-legged man next to Chen Pan . This was something Chen Pan 's father used to say , that death alone remained impartial . All the towering men , all the great beauties with kingfisher plumes in their hairnot a single one expected to grow old . But they , too , would return to dust . If it was true that man had two souls , one of the body and the other ethereal , then they would merge with the earth and the air after death . Chen Pan knew that he did n't want to fade away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next ; the dirt etched in his hands along with his fortunes . No , he would rather live in a blaze of courage and flame like Li Kuang , the ferocious warrior who 'd battled the Huns , or the heroes in the stories his father had recounted to him . Chen Pan 's father had been as restless as these heroes , never reconciling himself to a life on their farm . He 'd recited the Songs of Wu as he 'd absentmindedly hoed the wheat fields , grew devoted to the poetry of the deserted concubines of the Han court . He 'd referred to the sun as the Lantern Dragon , the Crow in Flight , the White Colt . The moon was the Silver Dish or the Golden Ring . Father had taken the Imperial examinations for twenty years without success . He 'd been a good poet but incapable of composing verses on assigned subjects , as was required by the examiners . He 'd blamed his absorption of useless knowledge for overburdening his imagination . Before picking up his brush to write , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditative hour as Chen Pan watched . Chen Pan 's mother ridiculed her husband as she hobbled from room to room on her lotus feet . " Ha ! Everyone calls him a scholar , but he has n't found a position yet . And in winter he wears a thread-bare robe . This is how books fool us ! " Chen Pan 's mother was from a family of well-to-do farmers , and far from beautiful . She knew little poetry , but used to repeat the same line to nettle her improvident husband : Poets mostly starve to death embracing empty mountains ! After ten days of cramped , stinking squalor , a fight erupted belowdecks . A city man named Yang Yn , contrary as a donkey , shoved a quiet farmer out of his bunk . " Son of a whore ! " the farmer shouted , punching Yang Yn in the chest . The city man pulled a knife from his vest and silvered the air with reckless slashing . The farmer disarmed him in no time , then promptly broke his nose . Chen Pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a last gift from his father . He decided that if Yang Yn or any of the other city cocks so much as jostled his elbow , he would knock them unconscious with a blow . The captain 's guards chained the troublemakers to iron posts . Others who 'd cheered them on were flogged to intimidate the rest . When the stubborn Lin Chin resisted , the guards kicked him in the ribs until he spat blood . The next day he died and his body was dumped in the sea . It was said that Lin Chin did n't sink at first but floated alongside the ship for hours , his eyes fixed on the sky . Chen Pan wondered if the dead man 's ghost would find its way back to China . Or would it wander forever among the unvirtuous and the depraved ? As the ship continued to sail , Chen Pan imagined his wife pounding the season 's meager yield of grain in their yard , looking warily to the sky for rain . They 'd been married for three years but had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On their wedding night , Chen Pan and his wife had drunk pomegranate wine and she 'd grazed his chest with her soft , scant breasts . But month after month her womb spilled its blood . Chen Pan 's mother blamed his wife for ruining the family with her persistent barrenness . Weak and sallow-skinned , Mother ruled the farm from her bed , knees tucked to her chest , lotus feet curled and useless from the painful binding long ago . In her closet were three minuscule pairs of jeweled slippers , all that remained of a dowry once rich with silks and brocades . She also chastised Chen Pan 's younger brother for spending his days writing with his one brush and inkpot . " Even from the grave , your father has cursed you with his useless ways ! " In winter , their house grew so cold that his small supply of ink froze . On board , the recruits began to suffer every manner of illness . Cholera . Typhus . Dysentery . Bad luck , Chen Pan decided , had settled into every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , not counting those killed in fights or beaten to death by the crew . Many more might have perished but for Chien Shih-kuang , sorcerer of herbs and roots . With his felt bag of magic , the wry herbalist from Z brewed teas to mend every imbalance , quieting fiery livers , warming cold organs , restoring the temperamental ch'i . The captain had promised Chien Shih-kuang payment of passage back to Amoy in return for his services on board . The herbalist had agreed because he 'd heard that in Cuba men knew the secret to halting the winter retreat of the sun . He , too , wished to learn this secret . One night Chen Pan dreamed that bandits had set fire to his great-aunt 's farm and that he alone was battling the flames . He woke up delirious , his skin hot and itchy . Chien Shih-kuang plastered a five-pointed leaf on Chen Pan 's forehead with a few drops of a caustic liquid . When his fever broke , Chen Pan tried to pay the doctor with one of his precious Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Chen Pan would learn that the herbalist had married a Spanish heiress in Avila and generously cured the poor . ) But not even Chien Shih-kuang could save the poor suicides . Chen Pan counted six altogether . After the melon-grower , another man jumped into the sea . One more poisoned himself with stolen opium . A boy , no older than fifteen , passed his days and nights in tears . He confided to Chen Pan that he was in great grief over having been decoyed on board . " I 'm the only child of my parents ! " he cried before thrusting a sharpened chopstick into his ear . In this way he stopped his regretting . A native of K hanged himself with strips of torn clothing deep in the ship 's hull . ( The guards had beaten him savagely for siphoning rainwater from their private barrels . ) Chen Pan thought his swaying sounded like the slow tearing of silk . With the winds stiff and the sea wide all around , he asked himself why someone would choose to die so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what made a man ultimately want to live . He only knew that he would survive unless somebody managed to kill him . The night the Wong brothers died , a squall engulfed the sea . The ship creaked and groaned like a sick man . The storm ripped off a mast and tossed two officers overboard . The men feared that the brothers ' ghosts had cursed the ship , that they were causing the thunder and lightning , the wind from eight directions , the waves as high as the Buddha 's temples . But by morning the sea was calm . At noon , a pair of whales was spotted off the Cape of Good Hope . Chen Pan clambered to the deck to see the breaching beasts . " Maybe we should kill them and get some fresh meat , " the lazy-eyed Wu Yao suggested . Chen Pan looked at him incredulously . It was obvious that this city boy had never caught so much as a pond carp . T he rumors spread with every day at sea . A bankrupt tailor pieced most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Caged birds miss their home forest . Pooled fish long for the deep . Chen Pan listened closely to the tailor , but he did n't circulate the man 's tidings : that their ship was headed for the Philippines ; that every last man on board would be killed there , heart scooped from his chest ; that they 'd be sold to cannibals who savored yellow flesh . There was talk of mutiny . Should they behead the captain and crew ? Set fire to the vessel ? Reverse their course to China ? Chen Pan knew there were men on board fit for murder , experienced warriors who 'd fought the British barbarians . Arrow-scarred , they 'd been dragged from their prison cells to the ship . But the ones who talked loudest were most filled with hot air . Chen Pan grew increasingly regretful . Had he deceived himself with his own grand dreams ? How could he go home poorer than when he 'd left ? ( Already , he imagined his mother 's rebukes . ) He tried to concentrate on his return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men would follow him , triumphant in his sedan chair , carrying a hundred chests of princely gifts on their shoulders . Enough silk for three generations . New harnesses for the village horses . Countless jars of turtle eggs pickled in foreign wines . The villagers would gather around him , paying him the respect in life that his father had achieved only in death . Because the days were long and the men so constricted , they entertained each other with stories about the tallest men who ever lived . Chung Lu-yan , who was fond of lantern riddles , reported of a man who , sitting down , was as big as a mountain and could dam the course of a river with his ass . Hsieh Shuang-chi , a stevedore who was tricked on board by his greedy brother-in-law , told of a giant who drank a thousand gallons of celestial dew for his breakfast . Chen Pan retold the jokes he 'd learned from his beloved great-aunt . His favorite was the one about the evil warlord who 'd had the length of his penis extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the warlord , Chen Pan said , until the day he passed a peanut vendor in the street . There was also a dwarf on board who could imitate perfectly the sounds of a cassia-wood harp . His name was Yang Shi-fng , and he sang of his land , where the tallest men grew to no more than three feet . In former times , he said , his countrymen had been sent as jesters and slaves to the Imperial Court . Then Yang Cheng came to govern the land of the dwarves and convinced the Emperor to annul his cruel trade . To this day every male born in T has Yang in his name . Others recounted the tale of the impudent Monkey King . Entrusted with the job of guarding the Immortals ' heavenly peaches , the Monkey King heartily partook of them instead . One transgression followed another , but none of the Jade Emperor 's emissaries could catch the fearless simian . Finally , the Buddha himself cast a powerful spell that sealed the monkey under a mountain for five hundred years . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chen Pan of his father . His hair fluttered with unruly tufts , no matter that the air was perfectly still . The pig breeder shared the last of his wife 's pickled cabbage with Chen Pan . The taste made them both terribly homesick . Chen Pan recalled the long summer afternoons his father had read poems to him , their plows left untouched in the shed . Before long the cicadas would sing , signaling the onset of autumn . These lovely seasons and fragrant years falling Lonely awaywe share such emptiness here When Chen Pan was thirteen , bandits had murdered his father for protesting the rape of the water-carrier 's daughter . She was only ten , pretty and dull , and willingly had shown the bandits inside her neighbor 's granary . Father 's legend swelled and the villagers recounted his heroism , but Mother disputed their accolades . " What father leaves his children nothing but his good reputation to eat ? " She scolded her sons to learn this lesson : " Avert your eyes to the sorrows of others and keep your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chen Pan 's arms and legs grew soft and white as the flesh of the rich women he 'd glimpsed in Amoy . Often he fantasized about these women , inhaled the scent of their lacquered hair , slowly dared to love them . He recalled the tales of the women of the old Imperial Court , who were protected by the Emperor 's purple-robed eunuchs . Alluring women swathed in furs and jade , their gauze-silk sleeves blooming like orchids . Delicate women who drank only camel-pad broth and nibbled on rare winter fruit to maintain their complexions . Women best admired from afar , like the mountain mist . Sometimes the men spoke wistfully of the roadside flowers who awaited them in Cuba , easy amber-colored whores who opened their legs for their own pleasure , expecting nothing in return . For all that it had cost him , Chen Pan could n't remember his one night with the dancing girl in Amoy . There were only the memories of his mournful wife . The ship passed through the Straits of Sunda without incident , then followed the verdant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In St. Helena they stopped for fresh water , continuing on to Ascension , Cayenne , the Barbadian coast , and Trinidad . Chen Pan heard the crew announcing each port of call , but the longer he remained on board , the farther away Cuba seemed . Could his eight years of servitude have elapsed already ? When the ship finally reached Regla , across the bay from Havana , Chen Pan climbed to the top deck to get a better view . It was a hot , sunny morning , and the city looked like a fancy seashell in the distance , smooth pink and white . A brisk wind stirred the fronds of the palms . The water shone so blue it hurt his eyes to stare at it . When Chen Pan tried to stand on the dock , his legs slid out from under him . Others fell , too . Together , he and his shipmates looked like a spilled barrel of crabs . The men were ordered to peel off their filthy rags and were given fresh clothes to present themselves to the Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jutted from their cheeks ; sores cankered their flesh . Not even a strict regimen of foxglove could have improved their appearance . The recruits were rounded up in groups of sixtywood haulers and barbers , shoemakers , fishermen , farmers then parceled out in smaller groups to the waiting landowners . A dozen Cubans on horseback , armed with whips , led the men like a herd of cattle to the barracn to be sold . Inside , Chen Pan was forced to strip and be examined for strength , like horses or oxen that were for sale in the country districts of China . Chen Pan burned red with shame , but he did n't complain . Here he could no longer rely on the known ways . Who was he now without his country ? One hundred fifty pesos was the going rate for a healthy chino . A Spanish landowner paid two hundred for him , probably on account of his height . His father had taught him that if you knew the name of a demon , it had no power to harm you . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of his buyer . Don Urbano Bruzn de Pealves . How would he ever remember that ? Several landowners tried to cut off the queues of their hires . Those who protested were beaten . Chen Pan was relieved that his employer did n't insist upon this . Now there was no question of his purpose in Cuba . He was there to cut sugarcane . All of them were . Chinos . Asiticos . Culs . Later , there would be other jobs working on the railroads or in the copper mines of El Cobre , five hundred miles away . But for now what the Cubans wanted most were strong backs for their fields .
