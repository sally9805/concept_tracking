<p> Eric Scott was under the gun . It was the Thursday before the Fourth of July and visitors were streaming through the fee booths at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area for a weekend of sun , fun , boating and beer on Lake Powell . <p> Scott , chief ranger of the park 's busiest subdistrict , had worked just three hours and already handled a trash bin fire , a car accident , a report of a suspicious person and a fishhook through a visitor 's thumb . <p> " This is probably the lull before the storm , " he predicted ominously . <p> At the north end of the lake , divers searched for an 18-year-old man who was overcome by carbon monoxide fumes while body surfing behind a ski boat . Within a week , four more would be dead : a toddler who drowned , a man who died cliff-jumping and two other men who suffered heart attacks . <p> Those were among more than 500 incidents at the park that holiday week , including dozens of drug and alcohol violations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases ranging from broken legs to a snake bite . <p> And all were handled by just 34 park rangers . <p> Thirty-four rangers to patrol 1.2 million acres and a 135-mile-long lake , which draws more than 400,000 visitors a month in the summer . <p> Thirty-four rangers to patch wounds , fight fires , rescue hikers , control boaters , protect resources , arrest criminals , help motorists - even recommend eateries for inquiring tourists - across an area about the size of Delaware . <p> " If it keeps going like this , we 're going to be in trouble , " Scott 's boss , Assistant Chief Ranger Mike Mayer , said when the week was over . <p> Glen Canyon is representative of a problem pervading the parks , recreation areas , seashores and monuments overseen by the National Park Service . Over the past two decades , as visitation increased and acreage expanded , the number of rangers charged with protecting our national treasures and the people who visit them dwindled . <p> In 1981 , the Park Service had 2,000 full-time enforcement rangers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres . Visitation was around 210 million . <p> In 2001 , about 1,500 full-time and 500 seasonal rangers patrol 384 units and 84 million acres . Visitation has risen to 286 million . <p> Many facilities have been forced to scale back operations . Some have no enforcement rangers , while others have only one - resulting in no backup and no coverage for the parks several days a week , according to a study last year by the International Association of Chiefs of Police , or IACP . <p> Some parks are experiencing crime problems similar to those of big cities : rapes , aggravated assaults , body dumping . In parks on the U.S.-Mexico border , drug smuggling and illegal immigrant activity is on the rise . Arizona 's Organ Pipe National Monument was dubbed the most dangerous national park in the country by a ranger organization . Some 80,000 pounds of marijuana were seized last year in the 330,000-acre park , which is patrolled by fewer than 10 rangers . <p> Even the large , more popular facilities have suffered . Yosemite National Park in California had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 1.5 million . Today , with 3.5 million visitors , fewer than 60 rangers patrol the park , which has among the highest levels of crime in the park system . <p> " When a ranger 's responding to a more serious call , the less serious may be waiting or they 're not dealt with at all , " said Don Coelho , the park 's assistant chief ranger . " We 're the EMS , the fire responders , the city police , county sheriff and highway patrol all mixed together . <p> " We 're stretched too thin , " Coelho concluded . <p> As the job grows more challenging , it also becomes more dangerous . Last year 's IACP report found that park rangers have the highest assault rate of all federal law enforcement officers . Three rangers were fatally shot in the 1990s , and 65 were assaulted last year alone . <p> " They do n't really advertise that to you when you apply for the job , that you 're more likely to be assaulted than a DEA agent , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . <p> What does this mean for park visitors ? Most rangers agree the general public is still safer at a Park Service facility than walking down the street of most cities , and the rate of serious crimes has actually decreased slightly . <p> Last year , park rangers also responded to nearly 5,000 search and rescue calls and handled more than 17,000 emergency medical cases , while 244 visitors died in non-crime-related incidents . <p> Yet some rangers say reporting of accidents and crimes has slipped because rangers are too busy responding to incidents to record them . Others , like Coelho , say the impact on public safety is harder to quantify . He notes that his rangers are so reactive , jumping from crisis to crisis , that they have little time to conduct proactive patrols to warn visitors of dangers inherent to the park . <p> " We might be able to prevent injuries , " Coelho said , " maybe even save lives . " <p> Dennis Burnett , acting chief of ranger activities for the Park Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Congress designates new park areas pretty much annually , and when that happens it does n't come with any additional manpower . So it has to be staffed with people from the existing work force , " he said . <p> The law enforcement-protection budget is drawn from Park Service operations , meaning a pot of money goes to each superintendent who then decides which divisions get how much . Lately , other priorities have taken precedence , including a $5 billion maintenance backlog and more money for resource protection - among President Bush 's budget initiatives for the agency . <p> Public safety has never been cited as a budget initiative , according to Burnett . <p> Others question the Park Service 's overall commitment to safety , from protecting visitors to its own employees . Dick Powell , manager of the agency 's risk management program , notes the Park Service has one of the worst employee safety records in the federal government . Among the nine divisions of the Department of Interior , the Park Service far exceeds all others in occupational accidents , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number was 705 for the Bureau of Land Management . <p> Powell points to a lack of oversight from headquarters and regional offices . <p> " It depends quite honestly on the personal commitment of the individual superintendents , " he said . " A few have taken this on , but there 's a lot of ambivalence among others . " <p> Powell also criticizes the agency 's efforts to prevent visitor accidents and fatalities , such as a string of carbon monoxide deaths on Lake Powell . Ten people have died of boat-related carbon monoxide poisoning on the lake since 1994 , seven of them on houseboats . But Powell 's office did n't learn of the problem and issue an alert to the entire park system until after the deaths of two boys last summer . <p> " I would hope that in the future we would be able to investigate and then recognize trends so this does n't happen again , " Powell said . <p> In 1999 , a congressionally-mandated study of Park Service law enforcement found the ability of the agency to protect people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of the park system and the cost of doing business . <p> The report recommended increasing the ranger protection staff by 1,295 full-time employees and converting 500 seasonals to permanent positions . <p> The following year , the IACP report concluded the Park Service 's law enforcement program was " undervalued , under-resourced and under-managed . " It recommended increased training and better equipment , as well as 615 new full-time rangers . <p> To date , none of the recommendations has been implemented , although Burnett said a task force is preparing to forward the IACP recommendations to Park Service officials for consideration . <p> Until then , rangers continue to juggle their myriad duties . They readily admit some responsibilities are being neglected , particularly resource protection - one of the main reasons the ranger force was first founded . <p> " The parks are always , somehow , going to respond to the big emergencies , " said Cindy Ott-Jones , chief ranger at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area . " What is falling down is the specific resource protection - the backcountry areas , the archaeological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranger , added : " It 's taking care of the urgent at the expense of the important . " <p> On that Thursday before the Fourth of July at Glen Canyon , Eric Scott had only himself and one other ranger to patrol 275,000 square miles of the park for much of the day . Three of his 17-member patrol had been dispatched to help search for the drowning victim up north . <p> He had no one to put out on the lake , dotted with dozens of houseboats and jet skis and swimmers . <p> He had no one to help reroute traffic when an entrance station was closed because of insects . <p> Eventually , he had to call someone in on overtime . <p> Scott , a 14-year veteran whose father also was a park ranger , is among those who believe the parks remain safe for visitors - for now . When asked about next year and the years after that , he thought for a moment . <p> " I could n't even speculate , " he said finally . <p> Besides , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck was crackling with more calls . <p> On the Net : <p> http : //www.nps.gov <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - Pauline Arrillaga is the AP 's Southwest regional writer , based in Phoenix . <p> End ADV for July 21-22 <p>
