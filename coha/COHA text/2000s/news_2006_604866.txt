<p> Like thousands of Americans , Kenneth McClain got personally involved after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast . But not in volunteering or rebuilding . <p> Instead , federal prosecutors say , he became part of a continuing aftershock of the costliest natural disaster in the nation 's history : fraud . <p> The 33-year-old Texan , safely living hundreds of miles from Katrina 's wreckage , is charged in an elaborate conspiracy that allegedly scammed more than $10,000 in relief checks from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) . <p> McClain is among roughly 150 criminal defendants charged by federal prosecutors since Katrina struck on Aug. 29 , a USA TODAY review of court and Justice Department records shows . A Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) review set for release today concluded that FEMA 's disaster aid program is riddled with fraud , a finding that suggests prosecutors could eventually file thousands of additional cases . <p> USA TODAY 's analysis also found a specific indicator of potential fraud : The number of households that received FEMA disaster aid in four Louisiana parishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the hurricane . As much as $166 million in overpayments could be at stake . <p> McClain , who a federal court affidavit shows had 27 aliases and open arrest warrants , allegedly got hurricane-relief aid in a plot that involved the theft of the name and Social Security number of a deceased Ohio man and a Texas hotel where a homeless man waited for FEMA checks to arrive . <p> The alleged scheme unraveled because a UPS store manager questioned what he termed a suspicious mail-forwarding request from the suspect , according to the affidavit . McClain , charged in a 14-count indictment , pleaded not guilty last month . <p> At least 50 of the suspects charged to date in Katrina cases are being prosecuted by one of the eight U.S. attorney 's offices in Louisiana , Mississippi or Alabama , the states hardest hit by the storm . Washington officials are scheduled to discuss the scope of Katrina-related fraud , FEMA 's oversight and the GAO report findings at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing today . <p> Gulf Coast federal prosecutors say most of the suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number will grow . <p> " There will probably be indictments every week for the foreseeable future , " says David Dugas , the U.S. attorney in Baton Rouge , and the director of the Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force command center at Louisiana State University . <p> Nicol Andrews , a FEMA spokeswoman , says some of the disaster aid the agency distributed was almost certainly siphoned by fraud . <p> " It seems some people just decided there was a lot of easy money out there after Katrina , " says Jim Letten , the U.S. attorney in New Orleans . " Each and every one seems to have believed that this was going to be a milk run , that their claims would not be scrutinized . " <p> ' Taking people 's word for it ' <p> Hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents were left homeless , hungry and with little more than the clothes on their backs after Katrina hit . Many had to flee their homes without personal records . Trying to cope with the catastrophe , FEMA on Sept. 6 activated its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system designed to speed aid to disaster victims . <p> To qualify , each applicant had to register the address of his or her primary residence with FEMA and attest that his or her household had been displaced and needed shelter . <p> The program provided a $2,000 check , debit card or bank deposit per household . Generally , FEMA rules limit payments to one per household . But the agency approved multiple payments to some families whose members were forced to split up by Katrina . <p> The agency says there was little effort to check the validity of the applications , which FEMA accepted until Sept. 26 . " The verification , at least at first , was non-existent . We ended up pretty much taking people 's word for it , " says Butch Kinerney , a FEMA spokesman . <p> Questions about FEMA 's handling of the aid prompted Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , to seek the GAO report that 's set for release at today 's Senate hearing . <p> In all , 803,018 Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama household applicants won Expedited Assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a total of more than $1.6 billion , FEMA records show . <p> Mindful that the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history would likely spawn a wave of fraudulent aid claims , U.S. Department of Justice officials formed the Hurricane Katrina Fraud Task Force in September . Nineteen federal , state and local law enforcement agencies are examining Katrina aid payments for crime patterns and investigating fraud tips from the public . Those tips have helped produce many of the criminal cases filed so far . <p> UPS manager got suspicious <p> One tip came from Will Beuschel , the manager of a UPS store in Abilene , Texas . He told investigators in November that a man using the name Roosevelt Hicks had tried to have him forward FEMA mail to an address in Dallas . <p> " It was suspicious . He just tried to force his way , " said Beuschel , explaining that the man was not a postal box holder at the store . <p> Jeffrey Terry , a U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigator , wrote in a federal court affidavit that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment records in a bid to sway Beuschel . <p> Terry investigated Hurricane Katrina aid applications submitted to FEMA in the name of Roosevelt Hicks . Records showed the agency had mailed a $2,000 check in that name to the UPS store in Abilene . According to the court affidavit , Terry determined that the Social Security number associated with the check had been issued in Ohio to the real Roosevelt Hicks , who had died in 2002 . <p> Terry also learned that the Dallas address where the man wanted the mail delivered was the Homestead Studio Suites Hotel . There , Terry discovered that mail for Hicks was received by Andrew Hamann , a 19-year-old homeless man . <p> According to the affidavit , Hamann said a man he knew only as " Jessie " brought him $60 each day to pay for the hotel room , plus $15 to $20 in spending money . <p> Federal investigators set a trap . <p> On Nov. 30 , as Terry and other postal inspectors listened nearby , Hamann phoned " Jessie " and told him several FEMA packages had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would come by to pick them up that night . <p> The investigators were waiting when the man arrived . The suspect fled when Terry identified himself . He was captured near the parking lot after a brief chase . <p> The suspect , who was carrying multiple identification cards , refused to give his name . A fingerprint check showed that the man known as Roosevelt Hicks , Jessie and other names was actually Kenneth Reven McClain . <p> McClain , who records show had prior arrests , is charged with conspiracy , mail fraud , identity theft and filing false claims in a 14-count indictment . He is being held without bail until a trial set for March . <p> McClain 's lawyer , Thomas Cox , says it 's clear some people were involved in FEMA frauds . " The question is , did my guy unwittingly take part in it , or knowingly participate ? " Cox says . " His contention is he was unwittingly involved . " <p> A tip-off from an ex-wife <p> Many of the other Katrina-related federal cases filed in Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation , involve similar fraud allegations . <p> Thirteen days after the hurricane struck , Bryan Michael Beets joined the hundreds of thousands of Katrina victims who sought Expedited Assistance grants . FEMA granted his application after he identified himself as the owner of a hurricane-damaged home in Long Beach , Miss. , court and government records show . <p> But his ex-wife , Allison , tipped investigators that he really lived and worked in Vicksburg , not on the Gulf Coast . A federal court affidavit states that investigators found evidence a party had been held in Beets ' undamaged apartment to celebrate the FEMA check . <p> Beets , charged with filing a false claim , has pleaded not guilty pending a trial set for May . His lawyer , Omodare Jupiter , recently filed a court motion that shows he is negotiating with prosecutors . Neither Jupiter nor Beets returned messages seeking comment . <p> In one of the largest Katrina fraud cases filed yet , California federal prosecutors have charged 53 suspects with siphoning more than $200,000 in Red Cross aid intended for storm victims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross call center in Bakersfield . The rest were the suspects ' friends and relatives , prosecutors allege . <p> At least 18 Katrina cases involving either FEMA scams or Red Cross frauds have resulted in convictions so far , according to the Justice Department . Federal prosecutors say they are investigating other suspected frauds , including cases involving relief claims from purported Katrina victims in Mississippi , Louisiana and Alabama . <p> USA TODAY findings <p> USA TODAY 's examination of FEMA and population records shows the number of applications the agency received from nine Louisiana parishes and 10 Mississippi counties exceeded the number of households documented in those localities by the 2000 U.S. Census and a 2004 update by Claritas , a marketing information firm . <p> In four of the most hurricane-battered parishes  --  Jefferson , Orleans , Plaquemines and St. Bernard  --  the records show FEMA approved Expedited Assistance awards for 481,624 households totaling $974.8 million . <p> However , 2000 Census and Claritas data documented no more than 398,629 households in the four parishes , or 82,995 below the number of FEMA-approved applications . At $2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $166 million in overpayments . <p> " That 's something we would inquire into , " says Dugas , when told by USA TODAY about the apparent disparity . <p> Andrews , the FEMA spokeswoman , says the high number of applications in the four parishes probably includes some fraudulent aid requests . But she says it could also be the result of households forced by the hurricane to split up , college students who were n't counted by the 2000 Census and other factors . " A lot of people applied because a lot of people were impacted , " she says . <p> Andrews says FEMA is pursuing a zero-tolerance policy against anyone who scammed Katrina disaster aid . The agency is trying " to recoup any money that 's been distributed inappropriately " by identifying suspicious payments and referring them to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General , she says . FEMA plans to start a comprehensive review of Expedited Assistance awards in mid-March , according to a Jan. 23 memo by Deputy DHS Secretary Michael Jackson . <p> Separately , Dugas says investigators at the Katrina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including what he termed a " disproportionately high number of applications " from areas relatively spared by the storm . <p> Several Louisiana and Mississippi emergency officials confirmed that same trend in recent interviews . In Yazoo County , Miss. , for instance , the storm damaged some roofs and trailers , but forced few residents out of their homes , says Bernice McGinnis , the county 's emergency management director . <p> Yet FEMA records show that 739 households , roughly 8% of the number counted in the 2000 Census and in the 2004 Claritas estimate , received checks that totaled nearly $1.5 million . " To me , that figure is quite high , to be honest with you , " McGinnis says . <p> " There was a lot of talk , almost from the beginning , that there were many people who were n't dislocated who were trying to get $2,000 checks from FEMA , " says Letten , the New Orleans U.S. attorney . " We have numerous additional ongoing investigations , and we expect many more indictments .
