China is moving factories , banning taxis , and even modifying the weather to clean up its dirty air in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics . AT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR , the world 's finest athletes will converge in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics . They will sprint , leap , and toss their way to gold  --  that is , if they can get a breath of clean air . China has some of the worst pollution in the world , and bad air kills 400,000 Chinese annually see " China 's Green Evolution , " page 78 . In anticipation of the Olympics , Beijing has launched a massive cleanup . Some 200 factories in the area will be relocated . More than 60,000 taxis and buses will be kicked off the road by the end of this year . And now Chinese authorities are looking to the heavens for help . For athletes , the two biggest pollution threats are fine particulate matter  --  bits of carbon , sulfates and other microscopic industrial by-products  --  and ozone .

" We can not have athletes exerting themselves under these conditions , " says atmospheric scientist David Streets of Argonne National Laboratory . The summer months are among the rainiest in Beijing , and officials are hoping that rain clouds will sweep in at the right time and wash away the bad air . " Whether pollution is a big problem or not depends on the weather , " Streets says . " Pollutants will build up , but they can be dispersed either by rain or wind . " Last year , Beijing 's Weather Modification Office announced plans to use a technique called cloud seeding , which attempts to induce precipitation by filling moisture-laden clouds with tiny particles of silver iodide . The particles , dispersed by plane or shot into the air from ground-based rockets , enable water vapor to condense and form raindrops . Invented in 1946 and used all over the world , including the U.S. , cloud seeding remains controversial , in part because it 's so difficult to prove whether it actually works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atmospheric Research , says that even if the Chinese seed a series of rain clouds prior to the Games and precipitation then washes away the pollution , it does n't constitute proof . The clouds might have rained anyway , without the particles . Nor would a foolproof technique eliminate the element of chance , notes Bill Cotton , an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University . Beijing will still need the right kind of clouds , and in the right place . " You ca n't make it rain if the conditions are not set for rain , " echoes Streets . Compounding the issue is a study Streets published last spring showing that 50 percent of the bad air in Beijing originates in the industrial provinces to the south , so even banning cars and inducing thunderstorms may not be enough to clean the air . " Even if Beijing shut down , you 'd still get pollution , " he says . " This is going to be the challenge for the Olympic Games . " Streets thinks officials will postpone events if the air is bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing 's Tsinghua University , who is conducting a massive study of pollution in China , suggests another strategy , based on the fact that periodic shifts in weather patterns can carry clean , fresh air down from Mongolia in the north , clearing Beijing 's skies .
