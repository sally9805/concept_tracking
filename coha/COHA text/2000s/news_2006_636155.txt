<p> Disembarking from her private rail car in Chicago in 1896 , the great French actress Sarah Bernhardt was nettled that the White City , the architectural gem of the World 's Columbian Exposition of three years earlier , no longer existed . " Tell me , " the Divine Sarah asked a Tribune reporter , " are any of the World 's Fair buildings left ? No ? How I should love to see them . " <p> Bernhardt was slightly misinformed  --  the White City 's Palace of Fine Arts , now known as the Museum of Science and Industry , stands to this day in Jackson Park  --  but more than a century later , her disappointment still resonates . Many visitors to Chicago remain astonished that the grandest achievement of the World 's Columbian Exposition of 1893 , which left many of its 27 million attendees dumbstruck by its sheer magnificence and gigantic scale , has largely disappeared . <p> " There 's an intense poignancy for people when you talk about the fair , because it was so ephemeral , " says Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When you look at pictures of the buildings , they seem so substantial , and people always ask : Why did it only last six months ? The White City has that magical Xanadu , Brigadoon kind of effect on people , which is part of why it 's having such an impact 113 years later . " <p> That impact is national in scope . Erik Larson 's immensely popular 2003 nonfiction book The Devil in the White City : Murder , Magic , and Madness at the Fair That Changed America , which today celebrates its 124th week in the top 10 of the New York Times ' nonfiction best-seller list in paperback , introduced a new generation of Americans to the Columbian Exposition . A Hollywood version , optioned by Tom Cruise 's production company and set to begin shooting next year , promises to transmit the fair 's legend to an even wider public . <p> And in Chicago , the ghosts of the White City are whispering louder than ever .

Chicago native Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins has written songs that allude to the fair . And Chicago-based artist Chris Ware , who used the White City as the setting of the most heartbreaking chapter of his graphic novel Jimmy Corrigan : The Smartest Kid on Earth , is currently negotiating with a production company for a film adaptation . <p> Urban Archaeology , a home design store in the Merchandise Mart , recently unveiled a 60-foot tile mural of the White City 's central Court of Honor , joining Richard Haas ' " Homage to the Chicago School " at 1211 N. La Salle  --  which features a trompe l'oeil depiction of Louis Sullivan 's iconic Golden Doorway to his Transportation Building  --  as one of Chicago 's most visible tributes to the fair . And the stately structure on the northwest corner of Millennium Park is a re-creation of an earlier Grant Park monument that provided an indirect link to Charles Atwood 's Peristyle at the Columbian Exposition 's dramatic junction with Lake Michigan . <p> To top things off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-dimensional computer model of the fair that eventually will allow Internet visitors to take a virtual tour of its buildings and grounds , including the raucous Midway and its most famous feature , the original Ferris wheel . <p> The fair , in short , haunts us still . But why ? The quick answer is that the 1893 Exposition was simply so important  --  " the greatest event in the history of the country since the Civil War , " as Harper 's put it that October  --  but that feels too general . What is it , specifically , about the White City that looms so large in the collective memory and the imagination of artists ? <p> It 's partly to do with the fair 's fleeting quality . To save time and expense , most of its buildings were clad in a temporary , plasterlike material called staff . The Peristyle and some nearby buildings burned to the ground in January 1894 , and most of the rest followed in the next few months . ( Because it contained valuable paintings and sculpture on loan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late 1920s and early ' 30s , it was restored and substantially rebuilt , in marble and limestone , to contain the Museum of Science and Industry . ) <p> " The White City was a dream  --  probably the closest thing to experiencing a real dream as was ever created , if you were there  --  that disappeared as quickly as it came , " says Chicago cultural historian Tim Samuelson . " Part of what sustains it in people 's memory is that it was so unreal and therefore so mysterious . If it had been permanent , in fact , that probably that would have spoiled some of its magic . " <p> ' A city of absolute opposites ' <p> But even as its very brevity has made it tantalizing , the fair has also taken on a symbolic power that seems to grow with every passing decade . Viewed from this distance , the White City increasingly seems to be speaking to us about the American enterprise and Chicago 's role in it : our self-esteem and self-doubt , our ambivalent attraction to grand civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That last dichotomy  --  as embodied by the fair 's handsome organizer , the blue-eyed architect Daniel Burnham , and the ( also blue-eyed ) serial killer Dr. H.H. Holmes , who preyed on young women in the shadow of the fair  --  immediately captivated Larson from the start of his research on The Devil in the White City . <p> " It was this monumental act of civic goodwill juxtaposed against this consummate evil , " says the Seattle resident and former Wall Street Journal reporter . " In a sense , that reflected what was happening in Chicago , which was a city of absolute opposites . " <p> On the one hand , Larson says , the White City was designed and built by the Gilded Age elite " as a way of demonstrating that America could come up with this level of sophistication . They went for drama at a time when architecture had very little relevance for most of the country , paving the way for things to come by inserting into the American psyche an appreciation for architecture . The sheer beauty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingeniously using the backdrop of the lake to stage the whole thing , was enough to knock anybody flat . " <p> But if the White City was a dream made real , much of the rest of Chicago was a nightmare . <p> " The fair gripped people , " Multhauf says , " partly because it was a vision of beauty in a place that was so squalid . " The streets were a quagmire of mud and manure , the air laced with soot and the rank aroma of stockyards and slaughterhouses . Poverty was widespread ; labor unrest simmered and sometimes boiled . Prostitution flourished . Not far from the baronial mansions of Prairie Avenue , there were 31 brothels on Clark Street between Congress and Harrison , all of which were open at the time of the fair . The German writer Paul Lindau called Chicago " a peep show of utter horror , but extraordinarily to the point . " <p> This bipolar quality will be explored in the Devil in the White City film adaptation , which Kathryn Bigelow ( " K-19 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year from a script by Christopher Kyle ( " Alexander " ) . <p> The film 's producer , Sigurjon " Joni " Sighvatsson , says the $30- to $50-million project has secured backing from a group of financiers ( including Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban ) and is being cast now , with an unnamed Academy Award-winning actor having expressed interest in the part of Holmes . The White City will be re-created with a combination of built sets and computer-generated imagery . <p> " I think the film will be a kind of manic vision of the American dream , or the price of it , which is being questioned right now because of the Iraq war , " Sighvatsson says . " Burnham is a symbol of what I would say America used to stand for , a visionary like Bill Gates , not like convicted former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski , and on the flip side is Holmes . It 's the light and the dark . " <p> Lightness and darkness also collide at the White City in Jimmy Corrigan , in which Ware presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even as he uses it as the scene of the book 's most hellish episode , the abandonment of a child . The boy 's father , who helped build the fair before being injured there ( which helps bring about a financial downturn in the family ) finally leaves him on the roof promenade of George B. Post 's Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building , which , at 787 feet by 1,687 feet , was the largest building in the world . " I just stood there , watching the sky , and the people below , watching for him to return , " the boy recalls years later . " Of course , he never did . " <p> ' Architecture as fantasy ' <p> The fair 's architectural legacy is a matter of considerable debate , but at the time its main buildings were a sensation with the public , many members of which burst into awestruck tears at the sight . <p> Burnham 's team of famous architects ( including Frederick Law Olmsted , who was responsible for many of the White City 's most dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honor in the Beaux Arts neoclassical style , derived from ancient Greece and Rome . Daniel Chester French 's towering Statue of the Republic  --  affectionately called Big Mary  --  surveyed the scene from one end of a long lagoon , facing Richard Morris Hunt 's stately Administration Building , taller than the U.S. Capitol , at the other . On either side , each monumental building was more graceful and elegant than the next . <p> With its strictly enforced uniformity of style , cornice height and color ( all the buildings were painted white ) , the Court of Honor was a triumph of order and unity , a romantic , monumental , utopian vision of urban ensemble . It all had a distinctly European feel , but there were also touches of American ingenuity everywhere , from water and sewage systems to the great trusses that held up the massive roofs and the thousands of electric lights that illuminated the fair at night . <p> " For the first time , people saw what an ideal city could look like , " says Lynn Osmond , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty and congested , but the fair showed how master planning could work . It changed the way people across the country saw themselves , kicking off the City Beautiful movement . " <p> The architectural legacy of the fair can be glimpsed in Chicago and other cities to this day . Local examples of structures inspired in part by the White City include Burnham 's Field Museum , Soldier Field , the Shedd Aquarium , and the Art Institute of Chicago 's Allerton Building , which was built in conjunction with the original fair and housed many of its related meetings and lectures . <p> But from the beginning , not everyone was enthusiastic about the White City 's design . Louis Sullivan and his young protege , Frank Lloyd Wright ( who was nonetheless inspired by structures in the fair 's Japanese exhibit ) , viewed it as Eurocentric , retrograde and antithetical to the cause of an organic American architecture . " The damage wrought by the World 's Fair , " Sullivan wrote in his autobiography , " will last for half a century from its date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair 's theatrical , self-consciously uplifting design  --  " architecture as fantasy , " as Alvin Rosenbaum put it  --  of having inspired a Pandora 's box of latter-day American kitsch , from shopping malls to Disneyland . <p> But the fair 's legion of devotees is unperturbed . " Louis Sullivan criticized Burnham 's neoclassical charter for the fair at the time as not ' adjusting to the reality and the pathos of man 's follies , ' an amazing statement , which I 've thought also applies to much of American architecture and art since , well , about 1893 , " Chris Ware says in an e-mail exchange . <p> " Ironically , to the modern mind , the whole fair seems a wondrous and practically inconceivable ' folly , ' something I think people today unconsciously hunger for , though they might not be willing to admit it , " Ware continues . " The scale and expenditure that went into the 1893 Exposition is really only matched today by Hollywood blockbuster movies , and is just about as transitory , but there 's still something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a real place to visit and encounter rather than simply a brief flickering of colored shadows on a screen . " <p> As it happens , the White City is emerging on a different kind of screen . Lisa M. Snyder , an architectural historian and member of UCLA 's Urban Simulation Team who specializes in three-dimensional computer models of historic environments , is working on Web project that will allow visitors to take an interactive , real-time virtual-reality tour of the White City . Still under construction , the site can be previewed at **50;2551;TOOLONG . <p> " Using a mouse , you 'll be able to navigate through the fair , which should give you the sense of scale and the monumentality of the fair , " Snyder says . " You 'll be able to fly above the fair , see it as a pedestrian would , or even take a gondola ride . The idea is to bring it alive for people .
