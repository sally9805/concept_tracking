" Happy , but for so happy ill secured . . . " // When Clive Staples Lewis was four years old , in 1902 or 1903 , he quite suddenly announced to his mother , father , and older brother that from that day forth he would no longer be known as Clive , but rather as " Jacksie . " To no other name would he answer . Eventually he allowed slight modifications  --  Jacksie yielded to Jacks , and then , finally , to Jack  --  but never again would he be Clive . Except to teachers and others whom he knew only formally , he remained Jack to the end of his days , sixty years later . // Such boldness indicates a precocious self-assurance , and surely the indication is correct : it was only a few years later that Jack interrupted his father in his study in order to announce , " I have a prejudice against the French . " When his father asked him why , he replied , " If I knew why it would not be a prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assurance of being loved  --  the expectation of tolerance , affection , and even indulgence that is so often found in the youngest child of a family . // And the Lewis family was a happy one , according to that model of domesticity adored and nearly perfected by the Victorians : the pater-familas , his Angel in the House , and children ( in this case sons ) respectful of Papy and adoring of Mamy . When Jack was six they had moved from a semidetached house in Dundela , an inner suburb of Belfast , Ireland  --  Northern Ireland would not exist , as such , for another few decades  --  into a rambling , expansive , new brick house in more prestigious Strandtown and had filled it with books . They called it Leeborough , or , more familiarly , Little Lea . It possessed a garden , and the servants were kind . Once the family took a holiday in France . It was ideal  --  but when , half a century later , Jack wrote about his childhood in his book Surprised by Joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Paradise Lost , a dark statement from Satan , musing on the occupants of the Eden into which he peers : " Happy , but for so happy ill secured . " // Lewis 's mother was named Florence Hamilton ; she was called Flora . She had been born in County Cork in 1862 , the daughter of an Anglican priest who throughout much of her childhood led a church in Rome . In 1874 he returned to Ireland to become the rector of St. Mark 's Church in Dundela . The Reverend Thomas Hamilton could be so deeply moved by Christian faith and doctrine that he actually wept during his own sermons . Like many Ulster Anglicans , he despised Catholics and thought them not only un-Christian but positively Satanic , but he was not simply and uniformly reactionary . He was for his time and place unusually supportive of women 's education : when the brand-new Royal University of Ireland ( founded in 1878 , and now called Queen 's University ) announced that from the outset it would accept women as students and give them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Oxford or Cambridge  --  he sent his daughter Flora . She performed very well indeed , in 1885 taking a first ( that is , a first-class degree ) in logic and a second in mathematics . // A year later a young man named Albert Lewis asked her to marry him ; she refused . This appears not to have deterred him , since in 1893 she agreed to his renewed proposal , though she made no pretense of ecstatic transport or ( it would seem ) anything like a sense of romance . " I wonder do I love you ? " she wrote to Albert , as though considering a problem in logic . " I am not quite sure . I know that at least I am very fond of you , and that I should never think of loving anyone else . " She would never , in her letters at least , confess to having fallen in love with Albert , but those letters do grow much more affectionate over time , and she reveals to him more and more of her personality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching she had heard , a careful exegesis of that famously difficult text " Old Mother Hubbard , she went to the cupboard . " Given the extraordinary skills as a satirist and parodist her younger son would later exhibit , one wonders whether this sort of gift could be hereditary . // This Albert Lewis had been born in the same county as Flora , in the city of Cork itself ; he was a year younger . When Albert was still an infant his father  --  who was in the shipbuilding business  --  moved to Dublin , and then later to Belfast . Albert was sent for his chief education to Lurgan College in County Armagh ( an Irish imitation of the English prep school ) , whose headmaster , an Ulster Scot named W. T. Kirkpatrick , would prove to be a central figure in the later history of the Lewis family . We will hear much more of him later . // After graduating from Lurgan in 1879 , Albert was " articled " to a firm of solicitors in Dublin  --  that is , taken on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified as a solicitor and soon moved to Belfast to start his own practice . As an attorney he excelled . He was , his younger son would later write , " sentimental , passionate , and rhetorical , " and while these qualities may have made him sometimes difficult to live with , they were of great value in the courtroom . " Woe to the poor jury man who wants to have any mind of his own , " wrote Albert 's former teacher Kirkpatrick ; " he will find himself borne down by a resistless Niagara . " Perhaps Flora Hamilton had a similar experience ; at any rate , the man she married in 1894 was a man on the rise , and he would eventually become a significant figure in the public life of Belfast . At his death in 1929 the newspaper obituaries would be prominent , long , and effusive . //
