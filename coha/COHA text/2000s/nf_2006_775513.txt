Something Rich and Strange // Revelation has as many mysteries as it does words . // Jerome // " I know the ending , " goes the slogan on a license-plate frame that can be spotted here and there on the streets and highways of America . " God wins . " // It 's a credo that pious Jews , Christians , and Muslims hold in common , although they might quibble on exactly what is meant by the word " God . " But the plainspoken slogan conceals a profound and enduring mystery : human beings of all faiths , in all times and all places , have wondered when and how the world will come to an end . Nowadays , of course , the very same questions are being asked ( and answered ) by scientists rather than theologians . For the Christian true believer , however , " the ending " refers to a scenario that is described in horrific and heart-shaking detail in the single scariest book in all of scripture , the book of Revelation . // The beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious signs and wonders  --  a black sun and a blood-red moon , the stars falling to earth , persecutors and false prophets , plague and pestilence and famine . Then the satanic arch-villain who has come to be called the Antichrist will rise to absolute power on earth . After seven years of oppression and persecution under the Antichrist , Jesus Christ will descend from heaven in the guise of a warrior-king , lead a celestial army of resurrected saints and martyrs to victory over the demonic hordes at the Battle of Armageddon , drape Satan in chains and confine him in a bottomless pit , and reign over an earthly kingdom for one thousand years . // At the end of the millennium , Satan will break out of his bonds , and Jesus Christ will be compelled to fight a second and final battle . At last , the dead will be resurrected , the living and dead alike will be judged , and the earth as we know it will be destroyed once and for all . The end of the world , according to Revelation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven and a new earth , " a celestial paradise where the Christian saints and martyrs will spend eternity in perfect bliss . Everyone else will sizzle forever along with Satan in a lake of fire and brimstone . // That 's the pitch line for the book of Revelation , so to speak , but the text itself is something even richer and stranger.The nightmarish landscape conjured up by its author is stalked by God and the Devil , the Lamb and the Beast , a lascivious whore and a woman in labor , angels and demons in the countless thousands , and a bestiary of monsters so grotesque and so implausible that they would not seem out of place in a comic book or a horror flick . At certain moments , in fact , the book of Revelation resembles nothing so much as an ancient prototype of the psychological thriller and the monster movie , and its imagery seems to fire the same synapses in the human brain . // Nowadays , Revelation finds its most ardent readers in Christian fundamentalist circles , but even someone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to find the plot and characters to be hauntingly familiar . The idea that the world will end ( and soon )  --  and the phantasmagoria of words , numbers , colors , images , and incidents in which the end-times are described in the book of Revelation  --  are deeply woven into the fabric of Western civilization , both in high culture and in pop culture , starting in distant biblical antiquity and continuing into our own age . The Battle of Armageddon , the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , the Seventh Seal , the Great Whore of Babylon , and , more obliquely , the Antichrist , the Grim Reaper , and the Grapes of Wrath have migrated from the pages of Revelation to some of our most exalted works of literature , art , and music as well as the sports pages , the movie screen , and the paperback best seller . // Above all , the book of Revelation has always been used as a kind of codebook to discover the hidden meanings behind the great events and personages of history  --  war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . And the words and phrases of Revelation , its stock figures and scenes , have been recycled and repurposed by artists and poets , preachers and propagandists  --  all in ser-vice of some religious or political or cultural agenda . The conquest of Jerusalem by medieval crusaders , the Bonfire of the Vanities in Florence during the Renaissance , the naming of the newly discovered Americas as the New World , and the thousand-year Reich promised by Adolf Hitler are all examples of the unlikely and unsettling ways that the book of Revelation has resonated through history . Even today , end-of-the-world fears and fantasies are peddled by Hollywood moviemakers and best-selling novelists , hard-preaching televangelists and presidential hopefuls. // Still , the book of Revelation is regarded by secular readers  --  and even by progressive Christians of various denominations  --  as a biblical oddity at best and , at worst , a kind of petri dish for the breeding of dangerous religious eccentricity . Most Jewish readers have never bothered to crack open a copy of the Christian scriptures , and when they do , they are deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of " the synagogue of Satan . " 1 Indeed , the fact is that Revelation has always been regarded with a certain skepticism  --  as " a curiosity that accidentally and embarrassingly belongs to the New Testament "  --  even within pious Christian circles , and even in antiquity . 2 So the ironic and disdainful treatment of Revelation in Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal , a darkly postmodern motion picture that questions whether God exists at all , is not wholly anachronistic . // " Death is behind your back . His scythe flashes above your heads . Which of you will he strike first ? " cries an overwrought preacher of the High Middle Ages as he wanders through a plague-ridden countryside in the company of flagellants and penitents . " You are all doomed , do you hear ? Doomed ! Doomed ! Doomed ! " And a battle-scarred squire , newly returned from . . . //
