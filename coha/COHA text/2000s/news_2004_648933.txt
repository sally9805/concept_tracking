<p> The milky morning sunlight showed snow that had fallen overnight in the hours after the statue was unveiled . The flakes rested on the upraised arms of Herb Brooks and on the top of the wingtip shoe on his right foot . <p> The Brooks statue stands near the Xcel Energy Center , site of the National Hockey League 's All-Star Game on Sunday . The man in bronze died last summer in an auto accident . One heck of a hockey winterfest is being held here in his hometown this weekend . <p> The Brooks spirit lives in the talented athletes and knowledgeable fans gathered among the ice sculptures around a spiffy rink . This is not an All-Star Game in the Sun Belt , a curiosity among palm trees . <p> For this one , the stars have come to where people cherish a game with worldwide reach . Among Americans , no one has accomplished more than Brooks , who won three college championships at Minnesota , coached several teams in the N.H.L. and led the 1980 United States Olympic team to a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather , a middle-aged man walking alone approached the statue and reached out with a gloved hand toward the base , which said : " Herb Brooks , 1937-2003 . Hockey Player . Hockey Coach . " As his fingers made contact , the man said , " Thanks , Herb . " <p> Because his voice quavered and his eyes glistened , it did not seem a good time to ask who he was and where he was from . Perhaps , as they say in the Twin Cities of Minnesota , he was from the " state of hockey , " which is also a state of mind . <p> Inside the arena , the corridors are lined with jerseys of Beavers , Tigers , Wolves and Bears of high schools from here to the Iron Range . The Young Stars game was here Saturday night , before the skills competition . On Sunday afternoon , the Western Conference plays the Eastern Conference . <p> There are many sideshows , too . One of them was the movie " Miracle , " which opened Friday night . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota guys . The scriptwriters have taken artistic license with some facts , although they avoided the temptation to show Mike Eruzione dropping the gloves to fight the ayatollah . <p> This is no " Slap Shot " burlesque or " Mighty Ducks " fantasy . This really happened , although without the melodramatic mood music . As Brooks , the actor Kurt Russell looks more like a late 1970 's Bobby Orr , and his Minnesota accent sounds less like " A Prairie Home Companion " than like Dan Aykroyd in " The Blues Brothers . " But the script gets right the rivalry between Minnesota and Massachusetts , always an undercurrent in American hockey . <p> And the happy ending stays the same . It may have been the greatest moment in American sports history , even if ABC Sports chose not to televise live the semifinal victory over the Soviet Union . Some of the actual videotapes are seen in the film , exactly as they were broadcast that first time , hours after the event . <p> Almost a quarter-century later , the echo of that game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey bosses from the United States and Canada discussed the World Cup tournament , which will be played in late summer . Four of the games will be here , including the United States against Russia on Sept. 2 . <p> How will the Americans fare ? Unlike Brooks 's college boys of 1980 , old pros make up the core of the current team . It is pretty much the same group that won the first World Cup over Canada in Montreal in 1996 , finished out of the medals in the dorm-trashing embarrassment of the 1998 Olympics in Japan and earned a silver medal against champion Canada in the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City . <p> Brooks was again the coach for that last one . Next time , it will be Ron Wilson , now with San Jose . Wilson coached the United States teams in 1996 and 1998 . Wilson and United States General Manager Larry Pleau stressed that American-born N.H.L. players who are eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs early this season might want to consider representing their country in the world championships this spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two reasons . The first is that the United States needs a respectable showing to qualify for the 2006 Olympic Games in Italy . The second is that jobs might be available on the World Cup roster . Now that Mike Richter has retired , the goalie spot is vacant . His replacement could be Rick DiPietro of the Islanders , Robert Esche of Philadelphia or Brian Boucher of Phoenix . <p> And what sort of attitude will the inconsistent Americans have ? In a reference to the 1998 debacle , Wilson said , " You take the attention , good and bad , and learn from it and make sure those kinds of things do n't happen again . " <p> On the positive side , the United States won the world junior tournament last month in Finland for the first time with a championship-game victory over Canada . But none of those players are likely to be polished enough to wear the red , white and blue in the World Cup . <p> So the roster should have many of the same names  --  Mike Modano , Tony Amonte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Chelios , Brian Leetch , John LeClair , Bill Guerin , Mathieu Schneider , Keith Tkachuk  --  who have represented the United States for a decade . <p> It is a talented group ; most of the players are more than 30 years old . They grew up in the euphoric wake of the Brooks team of 1980 . But there is a missing generation in the middle , between them and the world junior champions . Canada , by contrast , continues to churn out talent in all age groups . <p> Kevin Lowe , one of the organizers for the Canadian team , said that the Americans were strong " at the high end " of the talent pool , but that " perhaps they do n't have the depth . " In answering a question about the North American rivalry , Lowe said , " It 's not like we 're looking forward to a U.S.-Canada final . " But it was hard to avoid the feeling that this is exactly what the N.H.L. would like for the title match on Sept. 14 in Toronto . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised with younger players for the 2006 Olympics . One of the future prospects could be someone like Paul Martin , 22 , a rookie defenseman from the Devils here for the Young Stars game . Martin played locally for the University of Minnesota when the Golden Gophers won N.C.A.A. championships in 2002 and 2003 . He grew up in Elk River , Minn. , born in 1981 , a year after the 1980 Olympics . <p> Although he played in indoor rinks , Martin also learned in a traditional way , on a pond behind his house . His father , Dale , and a neighbor , Paul Gustafson , would string floodlights so the youngsters could play after dark . <p> " We did n't have boards , we used the snowbanks , " Martin said . The size of the playing surface , he said , " depended on how many we had and how eager we were and how much we wanted to shovel . " <p> Martin said his parents , grandparents and neighbors would be by to see him play Saturday night . When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people , Martin said : " It 's a lot of tradition and a lot of pride , being from Minnesota and playing hockey . Lot of frozen ponds . Lot of rink rats , playing pickup games . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
