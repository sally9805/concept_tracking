This Saturday night , 24 hours before the 2003 Grammy Awards , Clive Davis will put on a tuxedo , tap a microphone and introduce guests at his annual pre-Grammy party to the best new artist  --  of 2004 . " His name , " Davis confides in advance , " is Gavin DeGraw . He 's a piano player , a songwriter . A lot like Billy Joel or Elton John , but with the soul of maybe a Joe Jackson . He 's gon na be a star . " <P> Anyone with a Paula Cole CD collecting dust or an Arrested Development dashiki moldering in the closet has a right to be suspicious . Music executives prophesy long-term success for their artists all the time . Davis , however , has a track record . During his 35 years as a label president , he has signed and developed Janis Joplin , Carlos Santana , Patti Smith , Laura Nyro , Aerosmith , Bruce Springsteen and Whitney Houston . " I 'm not really sure what it is with him , " says Alicia Keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-Grammy party . " He just knows talent when he hears it , and he never hesitates about his own instincts . " <P> Even considering those formidable instincts , Davis , 68 , is in the midst of a career resurrection few thought he would ever see . In 1999 Davis was the president of Arista Records , the label he founded and had run for 25 years , when Arista 's German parent , Bertelsmann Music Group , pressed him to retire . After months of tabloid speculation about how Davis  --  whose ego is a frequent subject of industry jokes ( " Why does Clive Davis like CDs more than tapes ? He thinks they were named after him " )  --  would respond , he surprised his critics , friends and corporate overlords by stepping aside without a peep . As a reward for his grace , Davis was given seed money to start J Records , where in a short time he piloted Alicia Keys to five Grammys and 10 million worldwide album sales . In November 2002 slumping BMG decided that perhaps Davis was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; BMG bought out Davis ' share in J for a reported $50 million and named him chairman of the new RCA Music Group . <P> With control of J 's heavily urban roster and RCA 's diverse slate  --  which includes the Dave Matthews Band , Christina Aguilera , the Strokes and Foo Fighters  --  Davis is again the most high-profile executive in the business . Still , he insists , " my job now is the same as ever . That is , deliver transcendent talent . " In title , Davis is RCA 's president of artist and repertoire ; in reality he is too famous to scout talent ( the competition circles at the sight of him ) , and as even he reluctantly admits , he 's too old to be going out every night . Since his move to J , Davis has begun relying more on a team of five A.-and-R. executives  --  Keith Naftaly , a former radio programmer ; Peter Edge , who found Alicia Keys and Dido ; James Diener , the rock guy ; Trevor Jerideau , a hip-hop specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his legwork.
