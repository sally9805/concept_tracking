Chapter One The freezing February rain beat steadily on the roof of Luke Boudreau 's old Taurus . Through the water-spotted glass , he watched the winter-stripped trees mimic his own unsettled insides as they jerked and twisted in the gusty wind . He hunched a little deeper into his jacket collar and rubbed his chilled fingers against his thighs . Mississippi was the South , for God 's sake , the Magnolia State . How could it be so damn cold ? He 'd been parked here on this levee , watching the storm punish a broad , sweeping bend in the Tallahatchie River for the past hour . The rain slanted in silvery sheets . The clouds hung so low and gray that , despite the fact it was mid-morning , an artificial twilight encompassed Luke 's solitary torment . The moment he 'd been both dreading and anticipating for the past five months had come . In all that time , he 'd debated long and hard about what he would say , yet had found no words to convey his regret . This morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times before leaving his motel in black pants , a sport coat and tie-funeral clothes . He came to Mississippi as a man , not a soldier . Still , he felt as unprepared as if he 'd come straight from the battlefield to speak to the mother of the man who should n't have died . Died . He could thinkof no four letters more powerful , more cutting , more capable of drawing raw emotion to the surface , like blood in a fresh wound . Even so , that word was far from adequate to express what had happened to Calvin Abbott . Abbott had been obliterated . But no one outside his own team would ever know the reality of it . Each and every time Luke closed his eyes to sleep , he heard the shouts , the garbled static of his communications earpiece , the steady whomp-whomp of the helicopter blades , the explosions , the automatic rifle fire , his own ragged breathing-Abbott yelling his name . It was Luke 's own private hell , one he could n't share , even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life allowed the memory to sag to the rear of his mind . But quickly his own body brought it back to the forefront . His fingertips still tingled ; every step was marked by a stiff and painful right knee . Today 's weather brought a sharp and steady stabbing in his back . At least he could feel . He reminded himself of that every day . He put the car in drive and bounced along the gravel levee road , each rut and pothole sending a white-hot shaft of pain up through his shoulder blades . His white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel loosened when he reached the two-lane blacktop that led to Grover . It was odd , he noticed , the way asphalt weathered to an orangish pink here , instead of bleached gray . Heavy vegetation pressed close to the roadside , making some stretches look as wild and untamed as it had been in the days of the plantations . Areas that were n't cultivated with cotton supported trees so large and ancient they created a brittle archway overhead . Occasionally , those trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the kudzu vines that had engulfed them . All in all , the atmosphere made him feel as if he were driving through an old black-and-white horror picture . He concentrated on the faded broken yellow line bisecting the lanes , silently ticking off the distance between him and Calvin Abbott 's bereaved mother . Occasionally , dilapidated mobile homes or tin-roofed shanties rose like cankers in the brush beside the road , the rain sheeting off the gutterless roofs to puddle on the ground . Once , a mud-caked mongrel dog shot out from a lane , giving chase for a good quarter mile before he tuckered out and gave up . Grover first appeared in dribs and drabs along the highway : a car dealer ; a field ; the John Deere dealer ; a field ; the Dixie Drive-in , " Home of the Calhoun Burger " ; a baseball diamond with a single set of sagging bleachers ; a Piggly Wiggly with six cars in the parking lot ; a dated yellow-brick high school . Then , tree-lined neighborhood streets with small bungalows and shotgun cottages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes . He passed an old brick church whose interior lights shone through the intricate stained glass , a beacon of warmth in the cold , stormy day . When Luke reached downtown , he was hit with a strong sense of familiarity . The square was still festooned with Christmas lights that draped over the streets between the courthouse dome and the two- and three-story buildings that housed storefronts and offices on all four sides . Browning evergreen wreaths with big red bows that dripped rain and twitched in the wind encircled the globes of sidewalk lampposts . On the courthouse square was a Nativity scene-apparently separation of church and state had n't yet been an issue in Grover , Mississippi . Underneath the superficial differences between his own Yankee hometown and Abbott 's southern counterpart ( the courthouse was definitely southern , painted white with arched second-story windows that flanked a small balcony over the main entrance ; most of the surrounding businesses had galleries that extended over the sidewalk , providing both protection for the pedestrians and porches for the second floor ) , the small county seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courthouse square . Same dated storefronts . Same untimely removal of tired holiday displays . It felt just like going home . Instead of a growing sense of welcoming , the similarities made Luke feel as if he had sand under his skin . He had n't been home to Indiana for more than a day or two at a time since joining the army over fifteen years ago . Since his release from the stateside hospital a week ago , there 'd been a quiet burning in his gut telling him not to go back . He 'd decided it was because he could n't go home and pick up his life-the life he owed to Calvin Abbott-without first seeing Abbott 's family . But in the dark of night , when the truth could n't be pushed away with mundane tasks , physical therapy and innocuous friendly conversation , a knot of fear replaced that burning , and he knew his life , his identity , was the Army Rangers . He was special ops from bone to skin ; there was n't anything else in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin 's mother owned a greenhouse and nursery called Magnolia Mile , just outside town . Luke was going to take his chances on finding it himself before he stopped somewhere and asked . He had a strong sense of obligation not to speak to someone who might have known Calvin before he spoke to his mother-in the same way the next of kin had to be notified of a death before the general population . The rain slackened and the windshield wipers began to skip and complain across the glass . He turned them to intermittent . Businesses fell away in the same sporadic way they 'd increased on his way into town . He passed a swampy bog , then moved into a stand of old growth forest . He was just about to decide he was on the wrong road when he saw a brightly painted sign with MAGNOLIA MILE written in fancy script over an ornate gold arrow pointing to the right , down a single-lane chip-and-seal road . He turned . After traveling that narrow road another several minutes , Luke started to think he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that said , TURN RIGHT 1/4 MILE . The road bottomed on a low bridge over a creek , then took a near-ninety-degree turn to the left . And there it was , MAGNOLIA MILE written on a sign in front of a very large yellow Victorian house . The ornate white-trimmed front porch made a sweeping curve as it wrapped around the left side of the house . It seemed a little out of place in an area where all of the large homes sported columns and galleries , mimicking antebellum architecture no matter when they were constructed . A matching story-and-a-half carriage house topped with a large cupola and weather vane sat behind the main house . Luke could see a couple of large , old-fashioned glass greenhouses set yet farther back . He followed the crushed-stone drive to the carriage house , which had MAGNOLIA MILE over a double French door . Off to the side of the carriage house , a large screen of fancy white trelliswork hid the nursery stock from immediate view . In front of the screen was an artful display of sculpted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches , tiny waterfalls . Even in the miserable weather , it looked inviting . Abbott 's mother obviously had a talent for her work . Abbott had a younger brother , Cole , who was still in high school . Luke supposed it was a bit of cowardice that made him arrive here during school hours . But he allowed himself that . It was going to be difficult enough to face Abbott 's mother ; facing the youngster who worshipped him would be more than Luke could stand . He got out of the car and hurried inside , the first couple of steps the most painful ; he 'd been in the car too long . The first floor of the carriage house had been converted into a shop . It was warmed by a potbellied stove and smelled of old wood , peat moss and fertilizer . Various houseplants hung in baskets from the rafters . The cash register sat on a long counter near the left wall . There was a tent-shaped paper sign beside it that said , IN THE GREENHOUSE . C'm on BACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an unattended cash register to make him nervous . He went to the back door . It was a good thirty yards to the first greenhouse , and the rain had picked up again . At least the crushed-stone walkway would keep him from sinking knee-deep in mud . He lowered his head and made for the greenhouse at a gimpy trot , trying to avoid the deepest of the puddles . Two things hit him when he pulled open the steamed-over glass door . A wave of hot air , and Def Leppard rattling the glass panes with " Pour Some Sugar On Me . " " Hello ? " He did n't see anyone right away . His gaze scanned over the green leaves springing up from the plant tables . There , in the far corner , he saw two arms with fisted hands making simultaneous circles overhead in time with the music . Occasionally , light hair would bob above the greenery . Surprise trickled through him . Abbott 's mother was ... boogying ? Luke called hello again , working to reform the image he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a softly rounded body topped with semi-stylish gray hair that smelled of freshly baked cookies , snow-white Keds and a theme sweater . Maybe Yanni or John Tesh . Certainly not Def Leppard . The dancing continued . He walked toward that corner of the greenhouse , calling out twice to no avail . When he reached the aisle where he 'd seen the hands , he stopped and stared . Abbott had said his mother was " unconventional . " But no way could Luke see what was before him as a mother . Definitely not Abbott 's . A long strawberry-blond braid hung down the tall slender back , swaying as the young woman undulated provocatively with the music . Her short top rode up , showing a curving waist over her low-slung jeans . Those graceful arms bent and she rested her hands on her hair as her head bobbed from side to side . Luke had never seen a sight quite so unconsciously alluring . Def Leppard continued to beg for little Miss Innocent to sugar them up-and Luke wanted just that . She spun around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were closed . Her hips moved in a way that he 'd forgotten a woman could . Her elbows came forward , her hands still on the back of her head . Her navel winked at him . Luke 's mouth went dry . You ca n't just stand here . " Ex- " he swallowed , trying to get some moisture back over his dry vocal cords . " Excuse me ! " he shouted . Her eyes opened . Her hands flew to her heart and she jumped several inches in the air . " Good Lord , man ! Are you trying to give me a heart attack ? " Her voice held a strong Mississippi accent , but not the backwoodsy sort , more like a southern debutante , sorority girl at Ole Miss . Then her eyes narrowed and she crossed her arms over her chest . " Just how long have you been standing there ? " Luke felt heat come to his cheeks . Jesus , was he blushing ? " Not long . " He was n't sure she could hear his denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a challenging glare that told him she 'd heard just fine . She had beautiful light green eyes that flashed the same fire he 'd seen in her dancing . But the way she tugged the hem of her top over her jeans showed just how uncomfortable his spying had made her-no matter what her show of cool . " I'm- " " Wait ! " She walked toward him , holding up a finger . " Let me turn this music down . " She stepped around him and trotted to a table beside the door he 'd come in . As she passed , he caught a scent as sultry as that dance she 'd been doing . She dressed in a manner that said she did n't work at looking good-which somehow made her all the more appealing . He tried to figure her age . It was hard to tell ; she wore no makeup and had a very youthful spring in her step as she ran to the table . Much too young for you , Luke , ol ' boy . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we can talk like regular people . The plants have to have four hours of music a day . " Her smile was open and friendly . As he looked more closely at her eyes , he thought perhaps she was n't so young . He shuffled his male curiosity back into the closet as he took several steps in her direction . " The plants like rock ? " " The boss lady insists they prefer classical , something with energy . She does n't like them to hear ballads-makes them depressed . Def Leppard has plenty of energy . " She flipped her long braid back over her shoulder and lifted her chin slightly . Luke thought he saw a hint of blush on her cheeks that belied her rebellious stance . Again , he was drawn to her complex mixture of innocence and spunk . " I see . " He shifted his weight from his bad knee . " I 'm looking for M- " he started to say Mrs. Abbott , but knew Abbott 's mother had remarried after his father died ; Cole was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Liv , never Mom , or Ma , or Mother . Luke had no idea what her last name was . " For Olivia , " he finished . Using her first name felt disrespectful to his military-trained tongue . " She had to go to town . She should be back in about fifteen minutes . Can I do something for you ? " " No , actually , it 's personal . " He paused and looked around . " I 'll just wait in my car . " He started to take a step , but immediately felt his knee begin to buckle . Shifting his weight back to his good leg , he saved himself an embarrassing stumble . She cast a quick glance at his bad knee , her forehead wrinkled with a frown . Then her gaze passed over the ugly , jagged scar on the side of his neck . He tensed , dreading her questions , her pity . Her gaze then connected with his . He was n't sure what he saw in her eyes , but it was n't pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait ? " " No , thanks . I do n't want to interrupt your ... work . I 'll just wait outside for Olivia . " Continues ...
