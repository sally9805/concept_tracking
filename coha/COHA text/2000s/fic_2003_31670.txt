PETRA To : **34;775;TOOLONG From : **25;811;TOOLONG Re : What are you doing to protect the children ? Dear Admiral Chamrajnagar , I was given your idname by a mutual friend who once worked for you but now is a glorified dispatcherI 'm sure you know whom I mean . I realize that your primary responsibility now is not so much military as logistical , and your thoughts are turned to space rather than the political situation on Earth . After all , you decisively defeated the nationalist forces led by your predecessor in the League War , and that issue seems settled . The I.F . remains independent and for that we are all grateful . What no one seems to understand is that peace on Earth is merely a temporary illusion . Not only is Russia 's long-pent expansionism still a driving force , but also many other nations have aggressive designs on their neighbors . The forces of the Strategos are being disbanded , the Hegemony is rapidly losing all authority , and Earth is poised on the edge of cataclysm . The most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the children trained in Battle , Tactical , and Command School . While it is perfectly appropriate for these children to serve their native countries in future wars , it is inevitable that at least some nations that lack such I.F.-certified geniuses or who believe that rivals have more-gifted commanders will inevitably takepreemptive action , either to secure that enemy resource for their own use or , in any event , to deny the enemy the use of that resource . In short , these children are in grave danger of being kidnapped or killed . I recognize that you have a hands-off policy toward events on Earth , but it was the I.F . that identified these children and trained them , thus making them targets . Whatever happens to these children , the I.F . has ultimate responsibility . It would go a long way toward protecting them if you were to issue an order placing these children under Fleet protection , warning any nation or group attempting to harm or interfere with them that they would face swift and harsh military retribution . Far from regarding this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action , and , for whatever it is worth , you would have my complete support in all public forums . I hope you will act immediately . There is no time to waste . Respectfully , Locke Nothing looked right in Armenia when Petra Arkanian returned home . The mountains were dramatic , of course , but they had not really been part of her childhood experience . It was not until she got to Maralik that she began to see things that should mean something to her . Her father had met her in Yerevan while her mother remained at home with her eleven-year-old brother and the new babyobviously conceived even before the population restrictions were relaxed when the war ended . They had no doubt watched Petra on television . Now , as the flivver took Petra and her father along the narrow streets , he began apologizing . " It wo n't seem much to you , Pet , after seeing the world . " " They did n't show us the world much , Papa . There were no windows in Battle School . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the important people and wonderful buildings ... " " I 'm not disappointed , Papa . " She had to lie in order to reassure him . It was as if he had given her Maralik as a gift , and now was unsure whether she liked it . She did n't know yet whether she would like it or not . She had n't liked Battle School , but she got used to it . There was no getting used to Eros , but she had endured it . How could she dislike a place like this , with open sky and people wandering wherever they wanted ? Yet she was disappointed . For all her memories of Maralik were the memories of a five-year-old , looking up at tall buildings , across wide streets where large vehicles loomed and fled at alarming speeds . Now she was much older , beginning to come into her womanly height , and the cars were smaller , the streets downright narrow , and the buildingsdesigned to survive the next earthquake , as the old buildings had notwere squat . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were somehow blended here , Turkish and Russian , Spanish and Riviera , and , most incredibly , Japanese . It was a marvel to see how they were still unified by the choice of colors , the closeness to the street , the almost uniform height as all strained against the legal maximums . She knew of all this because she had read about it on Eros as she and the other children sat out the League War . She had seen pictures on the nets . But nothing had prepared her for the fact that she had left here as a five-year-old and now was returning at fourteen . " What ? " she said . For Father had spoken and she had n't understood him . " I asked if you wanted to stop for a candy before we went home , the way we used to . " Candy . How could she have forgotten the word for candy ? Easily , that 's how . The only other Armenian in Battle School had been three years ahead of her and graduated to Tactical School , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been seven when she got from Ground School to Battle School , and he was ten , leaving without ever having commanded an army . Was it any wonder that he did n't want to jabber in Armenian to a little kid from home ? So in effect she had gone without speaking Armenian for nine years . And the Armenian she had spoken then was a five-year-old 's language . It was so hard to speak it now , and harder still to understand it . How could she tell Father that it would help her greatly if he would speak to her in Fleet CommonEnglish , in effect ? He spoke it , of coursehe and Mother had made a point of speaking English at home when she was little , so she would not be handicapped linguistically if she was taken into Battle School . In fact , as she thought about it , that was part of her problem . How often had Father actually called candy by the Armenian word ? Whenever he let her walk with him through town and they stopped for candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and call each piece by its English name . It was absurd , reallywhy would she need to know , in Battle School , the English names of Armenian candies ? " What are you laughing for ? " " I seem to have lost my taste for candy while I was in space , Father . Though for old times ' sake , I hope you 'll have time to walk through town with me again . You wo n't be as tall as you were the last time . " " No , nor will your hand be as small in mine . " He laughed , too . " We 've been robbed of years that would be precious now , to have in memory . " " Yes , " said Petra . " But I was where I needed to be . " Or was I ? I 'm the one who broke first . I passed all the tests , until the test that mattered , and there I broke first . Ender comforted me by telling me he relied on me most and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied upon us all and I 'm the one who broke . No one ever spoke of it ; perhaps here on Earth not one living soul knew of it . But the others who had fought with her knew it . Until that moment when she fell asleep in the midst of combat , she had been one of the best . After that , though she never broke again , Ender also never trusted her again . The others watched over her , so that if she suddenly stopped commanding her ships , they could step in . She was sure that one of them had been designated , but never asked who . Dink ? Bean ? Bean , yeswhether Ender assigned him to do it or not , she knew Bean would be watching , ready to take over . She was not reliable . They did not trust her . She did not trust herself . Yet she would keep that secret from her family , as she kept it in talking to the prime minister and the press , to the Armenian military and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero of the Formic War . Armenia needed a hero . She was the only candidate out of this war . They had shown her how the online textbooks already listed her among the ten greatest Armenians of all time . Her picture , her biography , and quotations from Colonel Graff , from Major Anderson , from Mazer Rackham . And from Ender Wiggin . " It was Petra who first stood up for me at risk to herself . It was Petra who trained me when no one else would . I owe everything I accomplished to her . And in the final campaign , in battle after battle she was the commander I relied upon . " Ender could not have known how those words would hurt . No doubt he meant to reassure her that he did rely upon her . But because she knew the truth , his words sounded like pity to her . They sounded like a kindly lie . And now she was home . Nowhere on Earth was she so much a stranger as here , because she ought to feel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knew her here . They knew a bright little girl who was sent off amid tearful good-byes and brave words of love . They knew a hero who returned with the halo of victory around her every word and gesture . But they did not know and would never know the girl who broke under the strain and in the midst of battle simply ... fell asleep . While her ships were lost , while real men died , she slept because her body could stay awake no more . That girl would remain hidden from all eyes . And from all eyes would be hidden also the girl who watched every move of the boys around her , evaluating their abilities , guessing at their intentions , determined to take any advantage she could get , refusing to bow to any of them . Here she was supposed to become a child againan older one , but a child nonetheless . A dependent . After nine years of fierce watchfulness , it would be restful to turn over her life to others , would n't it ? " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . " He chuckled as if this were amusing . " Do you understand ? " " No , " said Petra . " Not afraid of you , " said Father . " Of her firstborn daughter she could never be afraid . But the cameras . The politicians . The crowds . She is a woman of the kitchen . Not a woman of the market . Do you understand ? " She understood the Armenian easily enough , if that 's what he was asking , because he had caught on , he was speaking in simple language and separating his words a little so she would not get lost in the stream of conversation . She was grateful for this , but also embarrassed that it was so obvious she needed such help . What she did not understand was a fear of crowds that could keep a mother from coming to meet her daughter after nine years . Petra knew that it was not the crowds or the cameras that Mother was afraid of . It was Petra herself . The lost five-year-old who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period with the help of a Fleet nurse , whose mother had never bent over her homework with her , or taught her how to cook . No , wait . She had baked pies with her mother . She had helped roll out the dough . Thinking back , she could see that her mother had not actually let her do anything that mattered . But to Petra it had seemed that she was the one baking . That her mother trusted her . That turned her thoughts to the way Ender had coddled her at the end , pretending to trust her as before but actually keeping control . And because that was an unbearable thought , Petra looked out the window of the flivver . " Are we in the part of town where I used to play ? " " Not yet , " said Father . " But nearly . Maralik is still not such a large town . " " It all seems new to me , " said Petra . " But it is n't . It never changes . Only the architecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they were forced to leave to save their lives . By nature , Armenians stay at home . The hills are the womb , and we have no desire to be born . " He chuckled at his joke . Had he always chuckled like that ? It sounded to Petra less like amusement than like nervousness . Mother was not the only one afraid of her . At last the flivver reached home . And here at last she recognized where she was . It was small and shabby compared to what she had remembered , but in truth she had not even thought of the place in many years . It stopped haunting her dreams by the time she was ten . But now , coming home again , it all returned to her , the tears she had shed in those first weeks and months in Ground School , and again when she left Earth and went up to Battle School . This was what she had yearned for , and at last she was here again , she had it back ... and knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nervous man in the car beside her was not the tall god who had led her through the streets of Maralik so proudly . And the woman waiting inside the house would not be the goddess from whom came warm food and a cool hand on her forehead when she was sick . But she had nowhere else to go . Her mother was standing at the window as Petra emerged from the flivver . Father palmed the scanner to accept the charges . Petra raised a hand and gave a small wave to her mother , a shy smile that quickly grew into a grin . Her mother smiled back and gave her own small wave in reply . Petra took her father 's hand and walked with him to the house . The door opened as they approached . It was Stefan , her brother . She would not have known him from her memories of a two-year-old , still creased with baby fat . And he , of course , did not know her at all . He beamed the way the children from the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity but not really aware of her as a person . He was her brother , though , and so she hugged him and he hugged her back . " You 're really Petra ! " he said . " You 're really Stefan ! " she answered . Then she turned to her mother . She was still standing at the window , looking out . " Mother ? " The woman turned , tears streaking her cheeks . " I 'm so glad to see you , Petra , " she said . But she made no move to come to Petra , or even to reach out to her . " But you 're still looking for the little girl who left nine years ago , " said Petra . Mother burst into tears , and now she reached out her arms and Petra strode to her , to be enfolded in her embrace . " You 're a woman now , " said Mother . " I do n't know you , but I love you . " " I love you too , Mother , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true . They had about an hour , the four of themfive , once the baby woke up . Petra shunted aside their questions " Oh , everything about me has already been published or broadcast . It 's you that I want to hear about " and learned that her father was still editing textbooks and supervising translations , and her mother was still the shepherd of the neighborhood , watching out for everyone , bringing food when someone was sick , taking care of children while parents ran errands , and providing lunch for any child who showed up . " I remember once that Mother and I had lunch alone , just the two of us , " Stefan joked . " We did n't know what to say , and there was so much food left over . " " It was already that way when I was little , " Petra said . " I remember being so proud of how the other kids loved my mother . And so jealous of the way she loved them ! " " Never as much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I do love children , I admit it , every one of them is precious in the sight of God , every one of them is welcome in my house . " " Oh , I 've known a few you would n't love , " said Petra . " Maybe , " said Mother , not wishing to argue , but plainly not believing that there could be such a child . The baby gurgled and Mother lifted her shirt to tuck the baby to her breast . " Did I slurp so noisily ? " asked Petra . " Not really , " said Mother . " Oh , tell the truth , " said Father . " She woke the neighbors . " " So I was a glutton . " " No , merely a barbarian , " said Father . " No table manners . " Petra decided to ask the delicate question boldly and have done with it . " The baby was born only a month after the population restrictions were lifted . " Father and Mother looked at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wince . " Yes , well , we missed you . We wanted another little girl . " " You would have lost your job , " said Petra . " Not right away , " said Father . " Armenian officials have always been a little slow about enforcing those laws , " said Mother . " But eventually , you could have lost everything . " " No , " said Mother . " When you left , we lost half of everything . Children are everything . The rest is ... nothing . " Stefan laughed . " Except when I 'm hungry . Food is something ! " " You 're always hungry , " said Father . " Food is always something , " said Stefan . They laughed , but Petra could see that Stefan had had no illusions about what the birth of this child would have meant . " It 's a good thing we won the war . " " Better than losing it , " said Stefan . " It 's nice to have the baby and obey the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get your little girl . " " No , " said Father . " We got our David . " " We did n't need a little girl after all , " said Mother . " We got you back . " Not really , thought Petra . And not for long . Four years , maybe fewer , and I 'll be off to university . And you wo n't miss me by then , because you 'll know that I 'm not the little girl you love , just this bloody-handed veteran of a nasty military school that turned out to have real battles to fight . After the first hour , neighbors and cousins and friends from Father 's work began dropping by , and it was not until after midnight that Father had to announce that tomorrow was not a national holiday and he needed to have some sleep before work . It took yet another hour to shoo everyone out of the house , and by then all Petra wanted was to curl up in bed and hide from the world for at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she knew she had to get out of the house . She did n't fit into the routines . Mother loved her , yes , but her life centered around the baby and the neighborhood , and while she kept trying to engage Petra in conversation , Petra could see that she was a distraction , that it would be a relief for Mother when Petra went to school during the day as Stefan did , returning only at the scheduled time . Petra understood , and that night announced that she wanted to register for school and begin class the next day . " Actually , " said Father , " the people from the I.F . said that you could probably go right on to university . " " I 'm fourteen , " said Petra . " And there are serious gaps in my education . " " She never even heard of Dog , " said Stefan . " What ? " said Father . " What dog ? " " Dog , " said Stefan . " The zip orchestra . You know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you heard them , you 'd take the car in for major repairs . " " Oh , that Dog , " said Father . " I hardly think that 's the education Petra was talking about . " " Actually , it is , " said Petra . " It 's like she 's from another planet , " said Stefan . " Last night I realized she never heard of anybody . " " I am from another planet . Or , properly speaking , asteroid . " " Of course , " said Mother . " You need to join your generation . " Petra smiled , but inwardly she winced . Her generation ? She had no generation , except the few thousand kids who had once been in Battle School , and now were scattered over the surface of the Earth , trying to find out where they belonged in a world at peace . School would not be easy , Petra soon discovered . There were no courses in military history and military strategy . The mathematics was pathetic compared to what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was downright backward : Her knowledge of Armenian was indeed childish , and while she was fluent in the version of English spoken in Battle Schoolincluding the slang that the kids used thereshe had little knowledge of the rules of grammar and no understanding at all of the mixed Armenian and English slang that the kids used with each other at school . Everyone was very nice to her , of coursethe most popular girls immediately took possession of her , and the teachers treated her like a celebrity . Petra allowed herself to be led around and shown everything , and studied the chatter of her new friends very carefully , so she could learn the slang and hear how school English and Armenian were nuanced . She knew that soon enough the popular girls would tire of herespecially when they realized how bluntly outspoken Petra was , a trait that she had no intention of changing . Petra was quite used to the fact that people who cared about the social hierarchy usually ended up hating her and , if they were wise , fearing her , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find her real friends over the next few weeksif , in fact , there were any here who would value her for what she was . It did n't matter . All the friendships here , all the social concerns , seemed so trivial to her . There was nothing at stake here , except each student 's own social life and academic future , and what did that matter ? Petra 's previous schooling had all been conducted in the shadow of war , with the fate of humanity riding on the outcome of her studies and the quality of her skills . Now , what did it matter ? She would read Armenian literature because she wanted to learn Armenian , not because she thought it actually mattered what some expatriate like Saroyan thought about the lives of children in a long-lost era of a far-off country . The only part of school that she truly loved was physical education . To have sky over her head as she ran , to have the track lie flat before her , to be able to run and run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her allotted time for aerobic exercisesuch a luxury . She could not compete , physically , with most of the other girls . It would take time for her body to reconstruct itself for high gravity , for despite the great pains that the I.F . went to to make sure that soldiers ' bodies did not deteriorate too much during long months and years in space , nothing trained you for living on a planet 's surface except living there . But Petra did n't care that she was one of the last to complete every race , that she could n't leap even the lowest hurdle . It felt good simply to run freely , and her weakness gave her goals to meet . She would be competitive soon enough . That was one of the aspects of her innate personality that had taken her to Battle School in the first placethat she had no particular interest in competition because she always started from the assumption that , if it mattered , she would find a way to win . And so she settled in to her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mastered the local slang . As she had expected , the popular girls dropped her in about the same amount of time , and a few weeks later , the brainy girls had cooled toward her as well . It was among the rebels and misfits that she found her friends , and soon she had a circle of confidants and co-conspirators that she called her " jeesh , " Battle School slang for close friends , a private army . Not that she was the commander or anything , but they were all loyal to each other and amused at the antics of the teachers and the other students , and when a school counselor called her in to tell her that the administration was growing concerned about the fact that Petra seemed to be associating with an antisocial element in school , she knew that she was truly at home in Maralik . Then one day she came home from school to find the front door locked . She carried no house keyno one did in their neighborhood because no one locked up , or even , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby crying inside the house , so instead of making her mother come to the front door to let her in , she walked around back and came into the kitchen to find that her mother was tied to a chair , gagged , her eyes wide and frantic with fear . Before Petra had time to react , a hypostick was slapped against her arm and , without ever seeing who had done it , she slipped into darkness .
