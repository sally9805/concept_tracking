As if charges of cronyism were n't bad enough , the inside story of the government 's decision to award a controversial no-bid contract to Halliburton is taking on overtones of even uglier " isms " : racism and sexism . Whistle-blower Bunnatine ( Bunny ) Greenhouse , the most senior civilian contracting official in the Army Corps of Engineers , is battling the Army 's attempt to demote her after she objected in writing not just to , but literally on approval documents for the up to $7 billion contract awarded to a Halliburton subsidiary in March 2003 for the repair of Iraq 's oil wells . ( The FBI is investigating whether Greenhouse 's allegations of favoritism , first reported in TIME last week , merit an expansion of its criminal investigation into Halliburton for overcharging the Pentagon . ) Meanwhile , TIME has obtained a new document that suggests Greenhouse , who is African American and the sister of NBA great Elvin Hayes , may have been operating in a racially hostile environment . Lieut . General Joseph Ballard , her former boss , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colleagues told him that " members of the upper Corps management made racist remarks " about her and that a senior official repeatedly said he " was going to get ' that bitch fired . ' " Ballard , who retired in good standing in 2000 , made those statements in a September 2003 Army personnel proceeding against Greenhouse that cleared her of any wrongdoing . Calling her job performance " outstanding , " Ballard , who is black , added that he strongly believed her race and gender " ruffled a lot of feathers in the Corps Command and also contributed to the disparate and highly critical treatment she has received . " Asked for comment , a Corps spokesman told TIME , " Army policy is to treat all employees fairly and with dignity and respect . "  --  By Adam Zagorin and Timothy J. Burger
