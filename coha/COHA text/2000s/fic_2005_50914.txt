HE LEFT THE MUSEUM intending to get a cab but they sped by on Fifth , uninterested in his hand in the air . He 'd come to New York alone to turn fifty and this shunning of his hand made him sadder than he already was , and sadness from such a small slight made him feel physically ridiculous , like his body was the punch line to a joke . It would do me good to walk , he thought as a way of dressing up his failure to hail a cab , and headed into the park . <p> Museums usually left him cold , so he 'd been surprised by his reaction to a painting by Gricault . Actually it was a copy of a painting : The Raft of the Medusa never strayed from Paris , which seemed a good idea to him . There were fifteen men on the raft , the last of 149 kicked off the frigate Medusa by French sailors . That 's what the plaque told him . The painting was huge-he guessed twenty feet wide and nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauntlet of gift and trinket vendors in a hallway of the Met . <p> As much as the drama of the painting 's unusual scale , the placement of the painting , on the wall opposite where he entered the hall , forced him inside the desperation of the men . It was as if the room was the raft and he was at sea . He believed their bodies , felt the muscles of their arms as they reached for the horizon ; and standing before the raft , he heard his breathing , which convinced him he could hear their breathing , that if he leaned his ear to the painting they would talk to him , and for a second he was sure the painted men were real and still alive . <p> This produced almost a feeling of joy , and it survived his embarrassment over the cab and he carried it into the park . He 'd visited the city twenty times over several decades before he spent an entire day there . Back then he lived with Alice , who had a chihuahua also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on that day they were in love with each other and Belvedere Castle , the Great Lawn , and especially the Mall , which they remembered from movies , most depressingly Kramer vs . Kramer , when the little boy runs toward his Meryl Streep mother and away from his Dustin Huffman father . It was summer and the American elms were in leaf , and at the end of the Mall he took Alice 's picture below Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott . She later took his picture strangling a stone rooster in a niche at the top of the stairs leading down to Bethesda , the angel who stands with wings spread , either taking off or landing on top of a fountain . That was the best day of their three years together and addicted him to the park ; this was his fourth visit in three days . <p> He was midway down the Mall when the woman fell . Swooned is more like it , the wind going out of her sails . He 'd just dropped five dollars in the guitar case of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bribe to make the man stop . He 'd noticed the woman only enough to be aware she was there , an old woman wearing a dark skirt , heavy coat , hat and gloves . When she fell he was n't sure at first she was really falling ; it felt like a shadow beside him had moved , as if a tree were making adjustments in how it lived . But the sound , an uuumphfing outrush of breath , was unmistakably human , the shell of utterance , and he turned just as she settled , as the last motions of her arm and skirt gave in to the ground . <p> Almost as soon as he was at her side she looked up and said something in a language he did n't understand . He thought it might be Russian because he was reminded of a woman from Leningrad he 'd known in his early twenties who smoked too much and sometimes said things while making love , Russian things that may have been complaints or compliments or both . He asked the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she shook her head and said , No American . She nodded toward the bench and he helped her up and over . Unsure what the woman needed , he looked around for assistance but the guitar player was gone and the only people in sight were at either end of the Mall , a few couples pointing in various directions and taking pictures . He turned back to the woman , who smiled but began to slide a little to the right , so he sat and put an arm around her shoulder . <p> Bending forward , he brought fingers to his mouth like he was eating , then pointed at her stomach . She shook her head and spoke and he could tell by her voice she at least had a cold , the sound trapped in her nose , which he noticed now was red and chapped around the edges as if she 'd been blowing it for days . He pantomimed blowing his nose and this brought more words and nodding ; she removed tissue from a pocket , held it up , and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He moved his hand to his forehead and pointed at hers , then slowly touched her skin , which was warm but not hot , suggesting just a bit of a fever . They were putting a puzzle together . With money in hand he pointed toward the cabs , pretended he was driving and honking , but she pushed his hand away and shook her head again . Her skin and clothes gave every indication she did n't live on the street . Finally he used two fingers to simulate walking , pointed at her once more and then at himself and held out his arm as if offering it to her , all by way of asking if he could escort her somewhere . She signaled no by patting the bench several times , and they stayed . <p> He tried not to admit he was happy for the company . He had TV in his hotel room to look forward to and the possibility of futzing around with the interactive something or other in the cabinet below the TV . There was a control panel and joystick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy they were meant to provide . Likely he 'd watch four guys talk about football-why certain games had been won or lost and why certain other games would be won or lost-talk loud and fast and three would be former players , their biceps and necks exceeding what we ask of biceps and necks . Likely he 'd order room service , some kind of pasta and some kind of pie , some kind of beer and it would be good or awful , hours would pass and he might take his clothes off because it 's more depressing to be naked and fifty and alone in New York than just alone and fifty when you realize you do n't care how many rushing touchdowns the Cowboys have allowed . <p> Her weight against his side was comforting . Anyone passing , as now and then someone did on this late December Sunday , would think them mother and son . Once in a while he bent forward , looked at her face and smiled , and each time she touched his hand like it was a kitten in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slump into him more and more . He was trying to decide if he should pull out his cell and call 911 or the hotel or Miss Manners when the woman stretched out and put her head in his lap . Within seconds she was asleep . <p> This should feel wrong , he thought . He knew it was probably best to shake her awake and shoo her on her way , that this kind of intimacy between strangers was a mistake . But it seemed natural that she 'd put her head in his lap without asking and maybe this was the surprise : that he was n't shocked , that he did n't mind , and that it also seemed natural for him to remove his gloves and touch her head and stroke the hair sticking out of her cap . Though gray and coarse looking , it was soft and soothed his hand , his skin . He wondered if hair dressers ever get distracted , just stroke and stroke until the person in the chair becomes alarmed . By now there was the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroked her hair , the day became warm , if only the small rectangle of the day falling at his feet . A rectangle of sunlight on a cold winter day is summer for those willing to extrapolate , and summer touched his feet as he looked across the park at the trees that suggest the city is a mirage . <p> The day he turned forty-nine , he had circled his fiftieth birthday and promised himself and the calendar featuring photos taken in Patagonia that he would do the first thing that came to mind when he woke that day . That first thing was New York , literally the Flatiron , and he paid dearly at the Chattanooga airport for the ticket and dearly at the front desk for his room , and it had n't mattered because he 'd turned fifty as spontaneously as he could . Now the woman was part of that spontaneity as was the park and the painting and he tried to link the events ; he thought of the man in the painting who held another man in his lap , held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have something to hold onto himself , perhaps just the idea of rescue . He tried to see either man 's face in the woman 's face-the man holding on , the man being held-but her face refused to be any other face , to be a painting , and he let the coincidence go . He closed his eyes and listened to her breathing and cars going by and " Noel " came and touched him : a saxophone somewhere in the park was in love with the season , and the man fell asleep . <p> He awoke when she awoke with a little start , as if her soul had left her body and was just now coming back . They had n't slept long , just a few minutes . He helped her sit and she blew her nose , three loud blasts that startled pigeons and filled the air with flapping , which he thought sounded like a hundred briefcases being snapped shut at once . They sat awhile beside each other , looking at the benches across the way , at the trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest and spoke his name , said Albert twice and slowly , drawing the syllables out like taffy . She did n't understand for a few seconds but then smiled and said Marina , and each of them said the other 's name and for a moment , the names Albert and Marina were a couple in the air , were sounds that touched and disappeared . <p> With some trouble she began to stand and he helped her the rest of the way . She pointed at the street and they walked arm in arm down the Mall . Three men went by on mountain bikes , helmeted and spandexed , their bikes whizzing and ticking as if they were metal insects . The sun was gone now , the gray afternoon felt like it had been cut from slate . The hotel was ten blocks away and had a bar that faced Seventh Avenue . He imagined himself warm at a table with a pot of tea and a dessert menu , a few cars going by , a few shoppers , the day finishing up , turning into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights the city wears after dark . <p> When they reached the street , her luck was better than his had been and the first cab she hailed stopped . Before stepping off the curb , she turned and pulled on his collar , pulled him down and close to her face and kissed him once on each cheek and said something they both knew he could n't understand . It was beautiful , what she said , though it could have been cruel , could have been her saying she was about to die or there was no God . But she drove off leaving him these sounds , soft sounds like a river unfurling , and he repeated them the best he could all the way to his hotel , moving under the power of a chant . <p>
