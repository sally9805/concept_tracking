<p> With apologies to legendary songwriter Cole Porter , pipefish and frogs do it . Even undomesticated apes do it . Today , on that gooiest of holidays , Valentine 's Day , we take a peek at the mating rituals of a few residents at Zoo Atlanta and the Georgia Aquarium . <p> Western lowland gorilla <p> The male western lowland gorilla can just about set his whoopie watch . Sure as clockwork , once a month , the female goes into estrus , meaning she 's fertile . What happens next , said Dr. Tara Stoinski , a primatologist at Zoo Atlanta , is " a little dance " between the female and male . <p> She sashays up . He sits down . She flirts . He fumbles about . <p> She takes a big breath and puffs out her lips , a primate version of Angelina Jolie 's killer pout . Even the dumbest ape understands that . The physical encounter is over in a twinkling . If everything works out , a baby gorilla appears about 8 1/2 months later . <p> Monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorilla ( that 's the scientific name , no kidding ) and Homo sapien . ( That 's you , dear reader . ) <p> For example , when a new female enters a group of males , the guys react with typical masculine cool , she said . They roar , stomp and throw things . " I 'm reminded of teenage boys in high school . " Doctor , please . Even apes have feelings . <p> Zebra shark <p> You may have seen her , swimming in the aquarium 's Ocean Voyager exhibit . She glides out of the shadows , long tail curling like a beckoning finger . <p> For the past few months , she 's been enticing the males and dropping fertilized eggs all over the big tank . A handful should be hatching soon , adding to the world 's population of Stegostoma fasciatum , zebra sharks . <p> When a female zebra shark agrees to mate , said Ray Davis , the aquarium 's senior vice president of zoological operations , a male engages in a little fish foreplay . " We put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " He bites her dorsal fin instead . <p> What follows is a meeting , sort of , between two fish bellies . After fertilization , sturdy pods , resembling huge watermelon seeds , soon follow , dropping on rocks and sand . The aquarium has dozens of them , which divers have periodically discovered while cleaning the big tank . Officials hope to share their young sharks with other aquariums , plus keep a few to share space in the big tank . <p> African penguin <p> If the animal kingdom has a poster couple for traditional family values , it must be Mr. &; Ms. Spheniscus demersus , the African penguin . These little swimmers at the Georgia Aquarium bond for life . <p> Things warm up for the birds when the weather gets cold . Their mating ritual begins like so many other species ' : with bowed heads , a little body contact , some whispered endearments . <p> Actually , they " bray like donkeys , " said Jennifer Odell , an aquarium senior biologist . <p> A few days after mating , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits down for the next 38 to 42 days , keeping her clutch warm . <p> The gray chicks are " fuzzy , gangly-looking things , " Odell said . They grow quickly and within three months are the size of mom and dad . <p> The aquarium has 15 penguins  --  seven couples and Ruby . Poor Ruby . <p> Think of her the next time you bray at your sweetie . <p> Frogs <p> Who among us has n't heard the chorus of our amphibian friends late at night and wondered what they might be saying ? <p> If anyone knows , it 's Joseph R. Mendelson III , Ph.D . The zoo 's curator of herpetology , Mendelson was in Mexico recently on a research trip . But he hopped to his computer to answer a few queries about their tender moments : <p> What sort(s) of positions do frogs assume ? <p> " Every manner possible , " he wrote . " A veritable Kama Sutra , no kidding ! " <p> " Gestation ranges from simple ... to extraordinarily complex , " Mendelson wrote . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs in the pond . Others do it the hard way , carrying eggs on their backs . <p> How many froglings ( scientists deplore such made-up words ) do they have ? <p> " Frog litters range from about eight to over 10,000 per female ! " Mendelson wrote . <p> Giant panda <p> Pandas are n't sprinters ; children cleaning their room move faster . But come springtime , the male manages to hotfoot it toward the source of the scent created by the female Ailuropoda melanoleuca . The female is in estrus for only 24 to 48 hours per year . It 's no time to dawdle . <p> " Their behavior is very telling , " said Jay Pratte , a panda keeper at Zoo Atlanta . For example , the female is probably walking backward , bleating . She 's urinated all over the place . The male finds this irresistible . After joining , a fertilized egg floats for a while inside the female before entering the uterus . About 45 days later , a scrawny little thing emerges . <p> That 's what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all reports , Lun Lun has been a superb nurturing mom . <p> Yang Yang ( shown at left ) ? He 's about as absentee a dad as a fellow can get . Since coming to Atlanta from China in 1999 , he 's pretty much been a sexual dud , too ; Atlanta 's pandas have yet to copulate . ( A handful of scientists used his semen to artificially inseminate Lun Lun . ) <p> Zoo officials hope they 'll take matters in their own paws the next time breeding season rolls around . That will be in 2008 , when Mei Lan is fully weaned . <p> Yang Yang and Lun Lun have a year to figure things out . <p> Bay pipefish <p> It 's hard to look at the skinny bay pipefish and think of sex in any fashion . But have you seen them mate ? The coupling begins with a swirl of thin bodies , a bubbling spiral that resembles snakes waltzing . <p> When that is done , the female offers up her eggs ; the male responds by opening a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sac , where the male impregnates them with his sperm . <p> And he keeps them ! The female swims off , promising to call . The male holds the eggs until they hatch four to six weeks later . He may release as many as 200 young pipefish into the wild . <p> The mortality rate is high . That 's the way of the world when you are an inch long and about as fat as dental floss . <p> The aquarium has four pipefish youngsters ; at present , they are segregated in a bucket behind one of the fish tank exhibits . Each is about 3 to 4 inches long  --  too young to dance just yet , but proof that even the stringiest creature can get tied up in knots over the other sex .

And in their world , nothing says " you 're so hot " quite like braying like a donkey. /ImageData* ImageData* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly has eyes for the opposite sex at Zoo Atlanta. /ImageData* ImageData* Photo : Giant panda/ImageData* ImageData* Photo : FRANK NIEMEIR / StaffOnce pipefish mate , the male holds the eggs till they hatch. /ImageData*
