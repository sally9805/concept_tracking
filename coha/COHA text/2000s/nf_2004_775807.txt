Deconstructing Hillary // Like the moon , she shows us the same face each time we see her . Sometimes she displays more , sometimes less of her visage , but always it is the same carefully presented persona : friendly , open , giggly , practical , family-oriented , caring , thoughtful , unflappable , serious , balanced , and moderate . Just like the moon , though , Hillary Rodham Clinton has a face she never shows us , a side that is never visible , never on display . // This book is a voyage around that side of Hillary - the parts of her personality and history that have been rewritten , reinvented , or omitted from her memoir Living History and her other writings or public statements . Senator Clinton 's book is no more revealing of her hidden side than is a telescopic view of the moon seen from Earth . Her book simply presents , in one volume and in greater detail , all the pretense and pretend that dominates the Hillary we are allowed to see . Rewriting History offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell more of the story she hides and the facts she omits . For much of Living History is not history , and much of Hillary 's history is not in her book . // Some of what Hillary conceals is not dark , only unseen . Not sinister , just covered-up , protected from our gaze . Parts of it , although not always flattering , would be quite acceptable if she were to expose it to full public view . With incredible discipline , however , she conceals this side of herself in order to create the idealized portrait of Hillary that 's on display in Living History . // But some of Hillary 's hidden side is indeed dark . Like the moon , she has been scarred by the constant pounding of political meteorites . Under their battering , she has developed a sinister side , which is chilling even to those who know her well . Some of her reinventions are defensive , a form of protective coloration to minimize her potential vulnerability and maximize her capacity to deny what she must to survive politically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle for onlookers . Just as we are curious about the dark side of the moon - and spend billions to fly there to have a look - so the missing parts of Hillary 's public image drive us to speculation , myth , and rumor about the real person underneath . // Both of the Clintons are masters of subterfuge . But Hillary 's deceptions and disguises are very different from Bill 's . Bill Clinton deceives himself , and fools us in the process . He pretends , even when he is alone , that he is not doing what he knows he is doing . He never tells his right hand what his left hand is up to . // By contrast , Hillary knows full well who she is and what parts of her must never be exposed to public view . She reminds herself consciously , day after day , which parts of herself to hide and which to expose . Where Bill 's instinct for deception is neurotic , Hillary 's is opportunistic . He wants to hide his private life from our eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the things that Hillary hides are integral to her political essence . They are who she is and what makes her tick . Her trickery is designed to hide her most basic character and instincts from all of us. // Covering up one 's flaws is certainly not unusual - especially in politics . All politicians have done things they would rather not see broadcast to their constituents . Everyone in the public spotlight has private issues he or she would like to keep hidden . JFK did not want us to see his illness or promiscuity . FDR disguised his paralysis . Bill Clinton pretended to be a faithful husband . But what makes Hillary 's unseen side unique is that , for the most part , it represents her real personality , her true self , far more than the person who smiles and giggles at us day and night . All public figures use makeup to cover a blemish or two . But only Hillary wears a mask of so many layers , one that hides her true face altogether . // Who is Hillary ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical that we do so . // After all , John Kerry is the Democratic Party 's candidate in 2004 , but Hillary is still its most popular politician . Unless Kerry beats Bush , she can have the nomination for the asking in 2008 . And even if Kerry wins and runs for a second term , it will probably be Hillary 's turn in 2012 . She could even run for vice president in 2004 . But would such a public step forward show us the real Hillary Rodham Clinton ? It 's hard to believe it would . Even after all the media coverage of the past twelve years - after we 've read the interviews , reflected on the editorials , and absorbed the analyses - she still remains a mystery . // Is Hillary a dedicated public servant , or an unabashed selfpromoter ? The victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy , or a shrewd operator who often gets caught in her own devious schemes ? An innate politician , or a reinvention of herself refined by her ghostwriters and handlers ? A sincere advocate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A New Democrat , or an old-fashioned liberal ? // More than a million people bought Hillary 's book hoping to get the answers . But , instead , all they got was a flattering self-portrait of an earnest , talented , devoted daughter , mother , and wife . Her rewrite of her own history reflects only the thoroughly reinvented Hillary she wants us to know - a softer image , a kind of Hillary Lite , but also an incomplete portrait . After reading it , we still do n't know what makes her tick . We still do n't have the answers . Once more , we see only what she wants us to see . // Yet the answers to our questions become more important as the possibility of a Hillary Clinton presidency becomes more and more real . After thirty years of political consulting , I know that longrange forecasts of political climate are dangerous ... // ( Continues ... ) //
