Here 's how Shimano 's new XTR group rates after a season of pounding . Plus : the ' 04 Dura-Ace road group-inspired by dirt ! - and the new freeride components . // With the introduction of a new XTR group this year , Shimano has given the world its take on the ultimate in cross-country mountain bike componentry . The group 's second revision since its 1991 debut takes its most noteworthy feature from Shimano 's road business : You shift by moving the brake lever . The XTR version , however , is even simpler . Instead of a two-piece setup ( the road group nestles a smaller lever just behind the actual brake lever ) , XTR relies on just one-push the brake lever up with the back of your hand to go to a larger cog or chainring , push it down for a smaller one . Shift quality is n't worlds better than past XTR , but that 's mainly because Shimano set the bar so high with previous versions . The big improvement is that , after you adapt to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially during hurried shifts . Beyond the new shifter ? There are hydraulic disc brakes that use an entirely new spline-and-lockring setup that reduces weight and allows easier , more effective mounting of the rotor to the hub . The new rotor-to-hub system is so good that it will redefine mounting . While the brakes are n't the strongest , they provide ample stopping power in traditional cross-country applications and , because of their light weight , make disc brakes a viable option for even the staunchest gram counters . All is not perfect , though : Shimano has had some early problems with pad retraction on the calipers that occasionally make setup difficult . A two-piece integrated crankset and bottom bracket relies on a massive hollow spindle and bearings housed outside the bottom bracket shell to maximize stiffness . It 's not a new idea , but Shimano has nearly perfected it : The crankset is stronger and lighter than its Octalink spline system . If you buy only one new XTR part , this should be it . A reconfigured front derailleur design promised more positive shifting feel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this part is a slam dunk . Its design is simpler than last year 's and provides slightly better chainring shifting . Also in the mix is a reconfigured rear derailleur , available in a Rapid-Rise design only . The spring pulls the derailleur toward the smallest cog instead of the largest ; you rely on spring action to shift to harder gears rather than easier , which was the previous standard in shifting technology . Shimano claims this setup offers more consistent shifting . Detractors , such as Specialized , whose product managers continue to spec the old-style XTR derailleur , claim that Rapid-Rise robs the rider of the ability to downshift as quickly as before . When Shimano first mated its Rapid-Rise rear derailleur to trigger shifters , shifting felt counterintuitive ; now , though , if you do n't use a Rapid-Rise derailleur with the new shifters you get the same feeling . The system simply works better when run as Shimano intended . Overall , the new derailleur seems more finicky to set up , especially when the cables get contaminated . When this happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most key components are compatible with previous generations . The new shifters work with old derailleurs , and there are still V-brakes available , as well as cable-actuated brake/shift levers to go with them . Sidebar BORROWING BACK Roadie technology inspired ' 03 XTR . Now Dura-Ace takes a cue from dirt . The boys in Blue on the U.S. Postal Service team have been rolling ' 04 Dura-Ace for a good bit of the season already , which means it gets the all-important approval of you-know-who . Drawing from this year 's XTR group for its crankset and bottom bracket design , the new Dura-Ace offers the stiffness of a massive , hollow bottom bracket spindle and large-diameter bearings housed outside the bottom bracket shell . The spindle is n't visible through the drive-side crankarm , creating a finished , sleek appearance . Other noteworthy updates include a 10-speed cassette ( which will retro-fit to your 9 's freehub body ) and a new hubset that , thanks to a new freehub body design , drops 40 grams but is n't compatible with 9-speed cassettes . XTR got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brake only ) , and Dura-Ace gets one for ' 04 . It uses a paired-spoke lacing pattern , but the crossover configuration ( spokes from the drive side of the hub attach to the non-drive side of the rim ) is gone for the sake of weight reduction-a more traditional pattern allows for a lower-profile , lighter-weight rim . The Dura-Ace rear derailleur is standard , non-Rapid-Rise . Shimano says the road set is less likely to accept change in this area , so it 's less willing to push the technology on them . The front derailleur is much stiffer than its predecessor , allowing shifting with 30 percent less hand force , says Shimano . The shift/brake levers have a new shape that allows easier shifting from the top of the hoods , and the blades move in a more ergonomic fashion , getting slightly closer to the rider as they 're actuated , to more naturally match hand movement . The front brake is stouter than the rear . ( Most of your stopping power comes from the front . ) The Dura-Ace pedal , introduced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sync with the new looks . As with 2003 XTR , expect a 10 to 15 percent price jump . Sidebar Once you adapt to the new shifters , they 're incredibly easy to use . Sidebar SAINT SHIMANO Daredevils get their own group Drawing from the basic design principles of XTR , Saint is the beefed-up component set that drop-off daredevils have been craving . It includes a new rear derailleur mounting system that eliminates the need for a derailleur hanger , the most commonly damaged part of a frame . The derailleur now mounts on the hub axle , although it works with standard dropouts and dropout spacing . The crank , bottom bracket and the hydraulic disc brakes are like XTR on steroids . The crank has durable , steel-threaded inserts for the pedals and comes in three-ring , two-ring/bashguard or single ring setups . Saint does n't include shifters or a front derailleur ; you 'll have to choose from other groups because Shimano did n't determine any specific freeride need for them . Figure on Saint to sell for a price between XTR and XT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mimics XTR , with dual-control shifters , Rapid-Rise rear derailleur , Hollowtech II crank and BB , re-styled V-brakes and a forged , one-piece , two-piston hydraulic brake caliper . // <p>
