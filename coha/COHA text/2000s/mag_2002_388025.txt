I 'll go head over heels to get a picture , but a celebratory handstand at the summit of Mount Whitney is fun , too . I got the chance while shooting the June 2001 cover story for Boys ' Life . I have also shot from horseback in the Cordillera Blanca , Peru ( top left ) , used a tripod in Tuolumne Meadows at Yosemite National Park ( center ) and dangled over the ocean at California 's North Coast ( bottom ) . I 'll even work above the action , like when I photographed a climber in Indian Creek , Utah ( opposite page ) . // My Life 's Work : Adventure Photographer As an adventure photgrapher , I often face danger , despair and deplorable conditions . And I love every minute of it . It 's 4 a.m. - the start of an 18 hour day . It is bitter cold outside , and the thin walls of my tent do little to keep the wind out of my face . I hate the sound of the alarm , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a game with myself every time . I try to convince myself that maybe the light is not going to be good , or the weather looks questionable , or everyone else is tired . I do n't need to drage myself out of my plush sleeping bag . But I have come to terms with the fact that if I do n't get out of my sleeping bag and get started , surely no one else in the tent will . I know deep inside that this early start is one of the magical ingredients for a powerful photo . Nothing spectacular is going to happen if I stay in my sleeping bag , so I have trained myself to suck it up , dig deep and unzip my bag . Once I pull on my fleece and start boiling water for the coffee , I feel like the luckiest guy on earth . I 'm here , outside , with friends , enjoying beautiful scenery , and I pinch myself . I get paid for this . This is my job . I am an adventure photographer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfing , trail running , kayaking , skiing , hiking , mountaineering and travel . Photograph Photograph Photograph People who look at my photos should feel what athletes are going through , whether reaching heights in Mexico ( left ) , buildering-as in bouldering a building-in Utah ( above ) or climbing ice in Colorado ( right ) . // See ? I Did Do It ! My interest in photography was sparked in middle school when I started going on weekend rock climbing trips . Mondays , when I got back to school , eager to share my outrageous tales , no one would believe me . The solution was to bring a camera on my trips so I could actually show my friends pictures of my adventures . Capturing story-telling moments was n't easy . Now , it is my mission . My pictures should allow the average guy to get a glimpse of another world . I love shooting photo stories and photo essays . Whether I am documenting a Scout troop 's climb up California 's Mount Whitney or surfing in Central America , I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human spirit of adventure . When I 'm photographing , I become part of the adventure . Here , no helicopters or press vans can contaminate the experience , no TV cameras and microphones or lights . We are not staying at a cushy hotel or eating at expensive restaurants . We camp in the dirt and cook on camp stoves , filter our water out of streams and go without showers for days at a time . That 's the way I like it-authentic and raw , with nothing between me and the experience . Hard Work , Good Friends The more dangerous and unpredictable the situations we get into , the better the photo potential . Take , for example , a Mexico surf trip gone awry when my travel companion , Tom Bulow , had an extreme allergic reaction to a tropical jellyfish sting . The only person in the small fishing village who knew how to administer an injection was the cook at the cantina . As Tom described it : " Yesterday , I was eating lunch on this same table . Now , the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my assignments last several days or even weeks . This allows me to develop close personal relationships with the people I am shoot ing . If I do n't know the folks I was photographing when I started the assignment , I certainly know them well by the end . This puts an interesting spin on my work . I know everyone in every single frame that goes through my camera . They are people I have lived with , shared tents with , climbed and traveled and surfed and suffered with . It 's a unique privilege to document the triumphs and despairs of my closest companions . Keep It Simple I keep my camera equipment simple . Often , I find myself crawling under fallen trees , climbing up ropes and running up steep slopes . I ca n't have a bunch of expensive stuff swinging around . Usually , I take only one camera body and two lenses so I can be light and fast . Ill even take off the camera 's motor to lighten the load even a little more . I 'll travel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enough camera equipment to complete my job . Most places I visit , it 's impossible to replace gear or buy film . Then , Ill pack all of my non-essential equipment into a hard plastic case . I always put two big locks on the case and a sticker that reads " Beware of Owner " in several languages . My luggage has always been intact on arrival . This case is waterproof and tough by necessity Once while hiking in the Cordillera Blanca in Peru , I had one strapped onto a burro . Loaded down with far more than it could carry , the poor animal lost its footing , bounced and tumbled 30 feet down a steep slope . In the end , my case was certainly in better shape than the burro . JOB FACTS : ADVENTURE PHOTOGRAPHER Adventure photography can be one of the most exciting jobs , but you have to be willing to work hard for it . Only people who are extremely athletic , self-motivated and willing to work from sun up to sun down - in the office or away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a good eye , but you must also have the ability to get to sometimes hard-to-reach places to make good pictures . That could include hiking 25 miles in a morning , or rappelling dow a thousand feet of rope in the dark , waiting for the sun to come up . Education and experience : A college degree and newspaper journalism experience help . Most important : you 'll need the desire to do new things and see new places and have a genuine interest in the people and things around you . Pay : There 's no fixed salary in this job . Adventure photographers are freelancers . This means the harder you work , taking pictures and looking for outlets for the photos , the more you can make . Job outlook : We 're a rare breed . Of the thousands who make a living taking pictures . I know only about two dozen adventure photographers in the United States . But if you 're willing to put the work in , and you have the ability , it 's possible . Adventure photography is relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available describing how to get into the field . Blaze your own trail . A Hard Life I Love The demands of my job require a high level of fitness . When I am out shooting , I need to be able to keep up with the athletes . No matter how much editing and office work I have planned for the day , I force myself out to train . I try to start the day with a five- or six-mile run followed by some calisthenics . Three days a week , I 'll go rock climbing or skiing . My photo lab is a mile and a half from my house so I run past the lab in the morning and drop off my film and then in the afternoon I 'll walk back with my dog , Pote , to pick up my film . Photograph HOW I GOT THAT SHOT I have a passion for telling stories through a lens . I love the unexpted pictures-the quirky and the weird . In Kansas , I photographed Project Bandaloop , a group that perf ( dance routines while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Salina , a small town in central Kansas , the dancers tw off a water tower about 200 feet above ground . Edging over the water tower was a challenge-like walking backward down a giant , wet beach ball . My feet would slip out from under me due to condensation on the steel tank . Eventually , I lowered myself beyond the point where my feet could touch the sphere and I began slowly spinning in the wind . Then the condensation began to drip all over me and my equipment This made opening the back of my camera to change the film very difficult , because it was like changing film in the shower . Not to mention keeping the glass on my lens dry . By the time I reached the ground I was soaked to the bone and so were my cameras . Anything for a picture .

Anything for a picture . // This is the kind of job you can do well only when your lifestyle and work blend seamlessly into each other . It 's difficult to have a family with this job . On many assignments , I 'm out of town for weeks at a time , with no access to phones , e-mail or other modern communication . I effectively disappear . Most trips are fairly typical : plagued by discomfort , uncertainty and danger . Somehow , these adventures yield amazing photos and lifelong friendships . There is nothing else I 'd rather be doing . <p>                 @ @ @ @
