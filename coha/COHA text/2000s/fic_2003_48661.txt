GRANT HOLLOWAY JUMPS OVER HIS NEIGHBOR . " Leapfrogging , " his neighbor calls it . " I 've been leapfrogged . " <p> What Grant has done is move out of the house on his neighbor 's south side and into the house on his north side . Grant has lived in the southern house for twenty years , through most of his career as a dentist and most of his failed marriage . When the old fart in the northern house drowns in his own bathtub , Grant buys the house and decides , at age fifty , to retire . <p> " Housefrogged is more like it , " muses the neighbor , Dan Frehling . " It 's offensive , in a way . " <p> Frehling , also fifty , is a very famous retired rock star . His band dominated the charts after Grant quit following new music , and Grant usually ca n't recall the name . Sometimes , though , he remembers and says , " That 's it ! " <p> When the old man drowned in his bathtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . The smell is so bad that Grant is advised to gut the bathroom and build a new one . Replace the carpeting , too , and tear down the drywall in the hallway . He plans to stay in his old house until the work is done , but the house sells fast . <p> " Let me do you a favor , " says Frehling when he sees Grant putting up a tent in his new backyard . He calls up his old record label and borrows back his old tour bus for Grant to live in . <p> When the bus arrives and rumbles into Grant 's backyard , the racket of crowbars gutting his house dies down . The foreman , a giant in a blue jumpsuit , ambles over to Grant and turns out to be a woman . She looks like a Viking queen from the opera . <p> " The boys want to know if that 's for real , " she says . <p> Grant surveys the name on the bus . He snaps his fingers , wondering why he keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . <p> One day an old Chinese man drives up in a Mercedes and asks if he can pick berries from one of two flowering trees in Grant 's yard . His name is Huang Li . <p> " Honeyberry trees , " he announces , pointing out tiny red berries between the blossoms . " I have a restaurant near the university . The berries are a delicacy . For many years , I have an arrangement with the owner . " He bows with his eyes closed , honoring the dead . " I pay him three hundred dollar to pick from this tree only . I would like to continue the arrangement . My competitor , Ai Zhou , pays the same to harvest the other tree . Perhaps he spoke with you already ? " <p> Grant shakes his head . <p> " Mr. Holloway , I am prepared to offer you six hundred fifty for the privilege of harvesting both trees . Yes ? " <p> " I 'd have to speak with Zhou first , " Grant tells him . " When did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three , " replies Li . " At night , if you please . Otherwise , the juice spoils . " <p> Grant says that if he has n't heard from Ai Zhou by mid-May , Li may harvest both trees . " There 's no need for payment , " he adds . <p> Li peruses Grant 's face as if looking for something , then bows as if finding it . Grant walks him to the Mercedes . <p> " One thing you should consider , " says the old man , sliding behind the wheel . <p> " Yes ? " says Grant . <p> " My competitor , Ai Zhou , is a cannibal . " <p> The Mercedes purrs away . <p> Grant is puzzling over Li 's parting words when part of his house collapses behind him . Workers stagger into the yard , coughing , waving their crowbars . The Viking Queen , dusty and white from hard hat to steel toe , approaches with bad news . <p> " Water damage , " she explains . <p> Later that same afternoon , Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands him an open bottle of beer . <p> " Look as if you could use it , " he says , his eyes examining the wounded house . Behind Frehling , among the trees that shade his spacious yard , Grant spies a girl with long , raven hair loading backpacks into a Jeep . <p> " That Sativa ? " asks Grant . Sativa is Frehling 's daughter . <p> Frehling nods . <p> " She graduate from Slippery Rock ? " <p> Frehling shakes his head . " She goes to some school in Mexico City now , plus she teaches rock climbing . We 're headed to the Superstitions for the weekend . " <p> " Climbing ? " <p> " Sativa climbs . Dad hikes . " <p> They drink again , listening to hammers and crowbars ripping at Grant 's house . As they watch , the roof appears to sag a little . <p> That night , Grant answers a knock at the tour bus door to find a young Asian man standing outside in a leather jacket . <p> " Zhou , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhou that the old honeyberry arrangement will be honored . <p> " I 'm surprised Li did n't buy my half of the bargain , " says Zhou , lighting a cigarette . he reaches inside his jacket and offers Grant an envelope . " Three hundred , " he says . <p> Grant takes the money . <p> Monday night , Frehling throws a party . Grant finds himself in conversation with smart people who display open palms when making a point , and speak in clipped sentences . They talk about good food , other dimensions , and wholesale clubs . <p> Later , somewhat drunk , Grant wanders through the trees to the fence that borders his own yard , and stands there alone , examining his broken roof line . A shadow appears beside him , leaning against the fence , a shadow with long hair . Surprised , Grant drops his beer bottle . <p> Sativa , Frehling 's daughter . <p> " Startle you ? " <p> " I thought you were the ghost of the old man in the bathtub . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is playful . <p> " Seems to be . " <p> This is the longest conversation Grant has ever had with Frehling 's daughter . <p> " Your dad says you 're in Mexico . " <p> " I 'm lots of places . Has Zhou come see you about the honeyberries yet ? " <p> " You know about that ? " <p> " I used to climb over and help him pick , and he used to try and kiss me . " <p> " Is n't he a lot older than you ? " <p> " Not so much . Anyway , older guys are okay . " <p> " I hear Zhou is a cannibal . Maybe a kiss is n't what he had in mind . " <p> Sativa moves away , two steps . <p> " That 's awful , " she says , her voice low . " Jesus , that 's fucking awful . " <p> " Not true , is it ? " <p> " It 's complicated , " she answers , and walks away . <p> A week later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric over his tree . <p> " A prophecy of frost , " he says . <p> Grant offers the old man an iced tea , and they sit in folding chairs on the grass , watching the parachutes rise . By and by , Grant asks Li how he and his accent came to reside in Arizona , and Li seems pleased to explain . <p> " I left Manchuria with my family before the Japanese invasion , " he says . " I first cooked in Las Vegas , at the Golden Panda . That was the childhood of Las Vegas , when they were still testing atomic bombs in the desert some miles away . Sometimes the shock waves broke windows , including , one time , the window of the Golden Panda . There were parties at the hotels where people stayed up all night just to hear the explosion and perhaps see the mushroom cloud . I would cook all night , clean the kitchen , then rush to the roof to feel the atomic wind . " <p> Grant refills their glasses . " Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observes . <p> " A Chinese talent , " Li assures him . <p> Late that night , a second crew arrives . In the morning , Zhou 's tree is shrouded in cheap plastic sheeting . <p> Sativa Frehling mades an appointment at Grant 's office . She wants her wisdom teeth pulled . <p> " I 'm suspicious of Mexican dentistry , " she says . " So many of them have bad teeth . I 'm not being racial ; it 's just an observation . " <p> When Grant primes the syringe with novocaine , she stops him . " No pain-killer , " she says . <p> Grant has heard this from patients before . <p> " Tell you what , " he replies , offering his standard response . " I 'll pull the first one with novocaine . After that , if you still want to do the rest without anesthetic , I 'll oblige you . " <p> Sativa agrees , and he yanks the first tooth . He sees her pupils widen as the sound of ripping tissue travels through her cranium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what convinces them : hearing what they ca n't feel . <p> Then he preps the syringe again . <p> " No , " she says . <p> " ForChrissake ! " <p> " You promised . " <p> So he does it . Tears pool in her ears . Her nose runs rivers . Veins form blue mountains on her neck and forehead . Sweat soaks her hair . When it 's over , Grant leaves the room so she wo n't see his hands shaking . He returns to find her hunched over the suction hose , shuddering . <p> When she lifts her head to face him , her eyes are glazed . <p> " Remember , " she croaks , " at Dad 's party , when you asked about Zhou ? " <p> " You should n't talk , " Grant advises . <p> " You 're the one who brought up the cannibal thing . The truth is , he lived in Guangxi province in China when he was little ; his parents joined the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution . Mao encouraged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything that was n't part of the new China . So they went around putting professors and artists on trial , anyone who was traditional , I guess , or smart . A lot of people got beaten up and killed , but in Guangxi province , it got really out of hand . They did n't just kill the teachers , they ate them . " <p> " I read something about that once , " says Grant . <p> " I guess I 'm trying to tell you Zhou 's OK . " <p> " He paid me three hundred dollars . That 's all I need to know . " <p> Sativa stares into Grant 's eyes for a long moment , then darts forward , laughing , and bites him lightly on the arm , leaving a ring of blood and spit . <p> " You 're not very tasty , " she sighs , wiping her mouth . <p> Grant goes home to find his house , like Zhou 's tree , draped in plastic . <p> " Asbestos , " the Viking Queen tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viking Queen has slipped out of her jumpsuit , revealing shorts and a halter top . Grant sees that she is not stocky , as he had imagined . She is lean and muscular , like Sativa , only older , maybe in her forties . The two of them walk back to the bus and she joins him inside . He makes lemonade . <p> " It 'll take a few days , " she says . " The code inspector and the EPA have to fill out reports . In the meantime , do n't go in there . " <p> Grant asks her out to dinner , and she accepts . Her name is Julie . They agree on Friday night . <p> " One of my guys says he saw that old man , " she says when he walks her out to her truck . " Says he was standing where the bathtub used to be . He 's Mexican . They 're superstitious . " <p> " Yep . " <p> " It 's true . They see things like that all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the backyard . Grant hears them muttering about the name on the bus . The next day , he breaks down some cardboard boxes and duct-tapes them over the letters . <p> " Well , " says Frehling , coming to the fence . " Obscurity at last . Saints be praised . " <p> Grant writes his own name across the cardboard with a Magic Marker . <p> Frehling puts his hands over his eyes . " Tabula rasa , " he says . <p> Two days later , on the morning of May 23 , Grant helps Li remove the parachutes from his tree . They climb inside the coverings , working with bamboo poles among the branches . <p> " Where did you get the parachutes ? " Grant asks . <p> " I told you about the Golden Panda in Las Vegas ? " <p> " Yep . " <p> " The ceiling of the Golden Panda was hung with these parachutes , because they are made from something like Chinese silk . After the war , it was still difficult to buy silk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated its ceilings with parachutes , which the gamblers thought was beautiful . <p> " One day , there came an announcement that an especially large bomb was to be tested , and everyone in Las Vegas was advised to board up their windows on the eastern side . But I myself , and the other kitchen workers , saw the shock wave from the tests as an opportunity for something wonderful . We very young then . When all the guests had left for the night , to attend bomb parties at the big hotels , we carefully took down the parachutes , folded them into a duffel bag , and rode a taxi out into the desert . There , we opened them wide and lashed them between stakes like a great silken wall . We wrapped the tethers around our waists and held tight , squinting east . <p> " When the test happened , we felt nothing at first , only saw the great flash and the fire cloud on the other side of the desert . Then came the shock wave , and six Chinese cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly . " <p> " I 'll be goddamned , " whispers Grant . <p> " When we brought the parachutes back to the Golden Panda , of course they were filled with sand and ripped in places . The owner fired us all , but then hired back half of us when he realized he 'd left himself no kitchen staff . Me , he did not hire back . He threw the ruined parachutes at me and said keep them , they would shame him now , hanging from his lovely ceiling . So I kept them . I mended them . Here they are . " <p> Some time later , with the coaxing of the bamboo poles , the parachutes drift across the yard , landing in a tent over the tour bus . <p> " Where 'd you go after Vegas ? " <p> " Detroit , regretfully . Even my ancestors advised against it . " <p> Grant plans to sit on his lawn furniture and watch the picking of the honeyberries that night . He sits drinking a glass of good Cabernet as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , which fits . Sativa walks barefoot around the back of the bus and sits on the ground beside his chair . <p> " I just do n't feel like it , " she gruffs . " All those old hippies talking shit all night . Can I have a beer ? " <p> Grant gets her a beer , and when he comes back out he holds out one fist . " Here , " he says , and spills four wisdom teeth into her palm . <p> " I climbed with this group of Indians in Guatemala last year , " she tells him . " They said they were the last of the Mayas , if you can believe that . They do n't have any choice when they have to get a tooth pulled or a broken arm set or something . The clinics are either too expensive or too far away , so they just do what I did . " <p> " Mmmm , " Grant replies . <p> " Want to see something they taught me ? Can we go inside ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wiping her feet with a washcloth from the little kitchen sink . <p> " Lay down on the floor and take your shirt off , " she commands . <p> The wine has rendered Grant pliable ; he does as he 's told . When he is stretched out in the aisle , she places her hands on the backs of two seats , raises herself like a gymnast , and places her bare feet lightly between his shoulder blades . Her toes press into his flesh . She digs in with the balls of her feet , kneading the muscles of his shoulders . <p> " The Indians are really good at this . If you do it right , it releases all the toxins into your bloodstream and you puke when it 's over . I ca n't do it that way yet . " <p> Grant sinks into a profound lethargy . <p> " I did n't tell you the whole truth about Zhou , " she says . <p> The admission is followed by silence . Blearily , Grant says , " Go on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth about his parents . I made it sound like they ate all the teachers and artists right there on the spot , but from what Zhou says it was colder than that . They divided them up and took them home to cook . They ate them , and fed them to their children , too . So Zhou 's just a cannibal by accident . " <p> Her toes squeeze the small of his back . <p> " God , " he sighs , nearly snoring . " That feels good . " <p> " Thank the last of the Mayas , " she replies . " Masters of great suffering and intense relaxation . " <p> He vaguely feels her let go of the seats , placing her full weight on his back . He either feels or dreams he feels her hands on his shoulders , and her lips brushing his neck . Then he 's asleep , lulled by poison in his blood . <p> Friday morning Grant awakens on the floor with a headache . Rolling onto his side , he sees Sativa curled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blanket has fallen loose to reveal a naked shoulder and a naked hip . He rises to his knees , pulls the blanket snug . Her eyes open just a little , then close again . <p> Someone knocks on the windshield , and Grant turns with a gasp , sure it 's Frehling , come to collect his daughter with rock-star wrath , but it 's not . <p> It 's Julie , dressed like an astronaut in asbestos gear . Behind her , he sees other astronauts prowling around his plastic home . <p> Julie stiffens visibly , and Grant understands that she has seen the younger , naked woman inside the bus . She turns away and walks toward the house with angry , sterile strides . <p> Grant sits down in the driver 's seat , cursing softly . <p> Something catches his eye ; across the yard he sees what looks like the remains of a festival . Li 's honeyberry tree , now stripped of berries , has become a sort of Chinese Christmas tree , festooned with paper lanterns , strips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , pulling the branches low . The boxes are orange , blue , pink , and bright red . There are hundreds of them , as if elves have come in the night , leaving gifts . <p> Zhou 's tree is simply picked clean . <p> Stretching , Grant glimpses the side of the bus in the rearview mirror . He discovers , unbelievably , with the side panels of the bus hidden under cardboard , he is once again unable to recall the name of Frehling 's band . <p> " Sativa , " he calls . <p> In the overhead mirror , he sees she has kicked the blanket away . He calls again , asking the name of her father 's band . " It 's something I should know , " he says . His voice , in his own ears , is unexpectedly desperate . <p> Sativa rises and pads toward the tiny bathroom . She calls the name over her shoulder . He hears her voice catch , though , as if she had to think about it for a second . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
