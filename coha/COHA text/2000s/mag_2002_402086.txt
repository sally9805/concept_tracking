It was Linda Cudmore 's tenth wedding anniversary , and this Ottawa mom of two was determined that her chipped and cracked fingernails were going to look respectable for her night out . After unearthing an old bottle of polish , she struggled to apply some colour as the chaos of the babysitter 's arrival and her husband 's business emergency swirled around her . Graph Not Transcribed To cover up what was quickly turning into a botched job , she added more coats to cover the streaks . " We left with my nails drying in the car , and some polish on my children 's pyjamas , I 'm sure , " says Cudmore . If you 've ever administered your own passenger-seat manicure , rest assured it 's not the only way to achieve decent nails . All it takes is a few minutes a day . " A lot of women do their nails just once or twice a month , but it 's better to spend one minute every day than 20 minutes every two weeks , " says Ellis Holevas , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip those neglected nails into shape : OIL , LUBE AND FILER One easy nail booster is applying cuticle oil . This can be done in 30 seconds before bed , or even while you 're breast-feeding . Keep the bottle next to your bed and massage a few drops of a natural oil , such as jojoba , grape seed or even olive oil , into the base of your nails ( avoid nut-based oils , especially around young children , in case of allergies ) . This keeps the skin around the cuticle moisturized , preventing hangnails . Applying oil also strengthens nails that are often plunged wrist-deep in their worst enemy  --  water . " Water gets in between the layers of the nails , making them weak , " says Holevas . " The oil keeps them moisturized and that makes them strong so you do n't have dry , cracked nails . " If you can , use rubber gloves when washing dishes to keep nails away from water . THE SHAPE OF NAILS TO COME Another ritual to sneak in is filing once a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really light file for your fingernails . Lighter is better because it wo n't tear them , " says Holevas . Avoid clipping your cuticles , but do try and regularly push them back with a washcloth after your shower so they do n't creep up raggedly onto the nail . Do n't feel you have to have perfectly shaped nails at all times . Blunted or squared-off nails look well groomed and are easy to maintain . To achieve square nails , file the top straight across , gently squaring the corners . If you prefer rounded nails , Salima Budhwani , an aesthetician with Pink Lime Salons &; Spa in Calgary , recommends filing straight across , then swiping the file from the nail 's corner to the middle . ( For toes , never cut down the sides , as this can cause painful ingrown toenails . ) READ THE LABELS To keep nails healthy , watch for the chemicals found in polishes and removers . Many removers contain acetone , and polishes often have formaldehyde resins and toluene in them ; all three can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakable . These chemcials are flammable , and prolonged exposure to them can cause drowsiness , dizziness and headaches . Also , you want to be careful about putting fingertips painted with chemically rich polish into your child 's mouth . Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Toluene and formaldehyde resin-free polishes can be found . However , these two chemicals help give the polish staying power , so products without them may not last as long on your nails . FINGER FOOD While you can shine , shape and polish your tips , the best place to start improving the look of your nails is with your diet . In the same way it improves the look and feel of your skin and hair , a healthy diet leads to shiny , strong nails . Many believe that means drinking excessive amounts of milk . The truth is that while calcium is good for your teeth , bones and nails , you do n't need a huge amount each day . " I always tell people you can drink a cow a day and it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Tanis Darling of Holtz Health &; Beauty Spa in Ottawa . If you feel your nails lack lustre , eat more biotin-rich foods such as eggs , soy and whole grains . Foods chock full of sulphur such as apples , cucumbers and asparagus are also good for nails . THE HOME MANICURE While regular oiling and filing alone will keep nails looking presentable , a home manicure and pedicure can be done in a hurry . Valerie Potter-Johns , owner and general manager of The Sanctuary Day Spas in Oakville , Ontario , recommends this quickie : File down rough nail edges . Then soak nails in warm soapy water for three to four minutes . Gently push the cuticle back with a face cloth . Dry hands and feet thoroughly , and massage in oil . For a treat , slather a rich hand cream on your hands , pull on thin rubber gloves , securing them at the wrists with elastics , and submerge hands in hot water for three to four minutes to let the cream soak in deep . Take the gloves off and wipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a clear base coat first to protect nails from the colour 's pigment , which can stain them yellow over time ( particularly dark , rich colours ) . Finish with a topcoat to prevent chipping . This does n't take as long as you might think . While you should use a top-quality base coat , many colour polishes now come in faster drying versions ( a minute or less ) . But they can dry nails out with regular use , so save them for an emergency polish . If you really want to go to town , give yourself a French manicure . Simply pick up a white pencil from the drugstore , soak it in warm water , rub it underneath the tip of the nail , then paint over the whole nail with a light beige or pink polish . If polish seems too much work , Elizabeth Nugent , an aesthetician at the Remedy Facial Bar &; Spa in Halifax , suggests the buffed look . " Buffers are usually emery-board-shaped with different grades of coarseness . They make nails shiny so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to buff , file or polish  --  there 's no need to resort to a passenger-seat quickie for nicer nails . <p>
