As Janet prepares to release her highly anticipated anniversary album , the icon talks candidly about why she loves working with Jermaine and why you may want to start calling her Mrs. Dupri BY DENENE MILLNER // Janet Jackson has never been shy about telling folks what she wants . From declaring her independence to asserting her sexuality , Jackson 's six multiplatinum albums have always been full of personal and , at times , provocative proclamations . Her latest effort , produced with the help of longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and executive-produced by Jackson 's boyfriend of five years , Jermaine Dupri , is no exception . A paean to the music that 's influenced her , 20 Years Old ( Virgin ) is a mix of feel-good harmonies , bassheavy dance tracks , and the occasional ode to doing the do . According to Jackson , sex is " a part of love , a part of God , " and her appetite , by her own admission , is absolutely voracious . Luckily for her ( and , no doubt , Dupri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up . LOVE WILL NEVER DO WITHOUT YOU " I feel like I finally met my match , " Jackson says , sinking into a plush green chair in the dining room of her Manhattan apartment . The home , with floor-to-ceiling windows and breathtaking views of Central Park , is filled with elegant furniture and art with an Afrocentric flair . Even the woman depicted in the original Picasso that adorns her earth-colored walls looks as if she 's got some Black in her . " In relationships it was always the guy telling me , Okay hold on , wait a minute , ' " says the singer who split from her second husband , Rene Elizondo , in 1999 and had an earlier four-month marriage to singer James DeBarge annulled when she was 18 . " I 'd ask my girlfriends , " Are n't we supposed to be the ones who say , " Wait , not tonight , I have a headache ? " ' " she recalls . " This happened through two marriages for me . I thought , Something 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say anything ; he knows I 'm ready . Anytime , anyplace . I know it sounds crazy , but it 's just the person I am . " Both Dupri and Jackson , who 'd been casual acquaintances for years , grew up in the industry . But it was n't until five years ago that the two really clicked . Jackson was on tour in Japan when she found out Dupri had no plans for his birthday and invited him to the secluded Caribbean island of Mustique to celebrate . She says she thinks he was already digging her by then , and while they talked on the beach , she realized she liked him , too . Almost immediately , the relationship sparked a minicontroversy-What 's she doing with him ? - and plenty of jokes . The most memorable was Chris Rock 's lamenting at MTV 's 2003 Video Music Awards that if the diminutive Dupri could get Jackson , then , hell , everyone had a chance . Jackson bristles if you so much as mention the jokes that feature her man as the punch line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a league of his own . " Jermaine makes me want to have kids , and I never had that feeling before , " she confesses , her face stretching into a 1,000-wattgrin . " I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , but if he asked me to marry him , I 'd probably say yes . " She corrects herself , herface serious this time : " Not probably . I would . " The couple is so tight that while some women cringe at the idea of bringing their man to work , Jackson says collaborating with Dupri on 20 Years Old was never a concern . " Not once did I think we could n't do it , " she says . " We have an easy give-and-take , and Jermaine 's incredibly hardworking . Jimmy 's going to kill me for saying this , but he and I would be working on one song while Jermaine was on his second or third idea . " But make no mistake-it 's much more than Dupri 's musical wizardry that sealed the couple 's bond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finding her soul mate . " When we were in Mustique , there were certain things Jermaine would say that made me feel as if he were reading my mind-thoughts I 'd never expressed to anyone , " she says . " And it was n't just one thing ; he kept saying things that were just jaw-dropping for me . He really sees me for who I am . " So much so , that even when gossip wags filled their pages with paparazzi shots of Jackson weighing in at a whopping 180 pounds-she says she gained the weight for a movie role that fell through-Jermaine never once said anything about her size except that he loved every inch of her . " You know what he 'd do ? I 'm so embarrassed , " Jackson says , bursting out laughing . " He 'd grab my stomach and look into my eyes and say , This is mine too . ' And he 'd kiss me and say , ? love you . I love you . ' l have never , ever had anyone do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It also says a lot about how far Jackson has come . IN CONTROL AT LAST There was a time , the singer says , when she was actually ashamed of her body . She remembers once being asked to look in the mirror and pick out a body part she loved ; she burst into tears " because I did n't see anything I liked . " It 's a surprising sentiment from someone who single-handedly changed the way a generation of female performers hit the stage . Before Jackson , little was expected of girl singers except that they coo about love and heartbreak and look pretty in their dresses . Jackson 's athleticism was something we had n't seen since the days of Tina Turner . Whether she was grinding and popping in an arena or gyrating her chiseled abs in a video , watching Jackson was always an event-the kind you raved about at the salon . While we all looked on , Jackson built the stage on which Beyonc , Ciara and Shakira now shimmy . Jackson turned 40 this past May . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of her man that 's finally helped the icon put that self-doubt behind her . Now she insists she loves what she sees in the mirror-whether it 's a 180-pound woman in sweats or a svelte size 2 . " It 's about being comfortable with who you are , regardless of what anybody else thinks , " she says , stressing that her recent 60-pound weight loss is because she needs to be fit for her upcoming tour , not because she thought there was anything wrong with her . " It 's about being happy with you , " she adds . " If you 're not happy , then do something about it . If you are happy , good for you . " And that 's the beauty of being a grown woman-finding joy in every corner , even the one everyone else thinks is dark , which seems to be exactly what Jackson 's done .
