Chapter One The revelation struck Molly Boudreau without warning , like a giant crashing wave of frigid water . The fierce power of it sucked the breath from her lungs and the determination from her heart . It was as if she 'd stood deaf while the thunderous surge behind her had gathered power , numb while the ground had trembled in warning beneath her feet . Deaf and numb and utterly unsuspecting . Her entire life had been centered upon becoming a doctor . Perhaps she 'd emerged from the womb possessing a single-minded determination . It had n't been a distant wishing as most childhood fantasies , but a ruby red laser beam , so focused and intense in its being that nothing distracted her from it . Not slumber parties , or big games , or boyfriends . Not financial obstacles-of which there were many for a poor girl from a small midwestern town . She had n't wavered once in her resolve , not from grade school through the endless fatigue-strained hours of residency . But suddenly she realized her focus had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come after . She felt as if she 'd been engaged in a frenzied uphill battle , wresting free of enemies that struggled against her , finding herself at the summit , breathless and bewildered by the lack of opposition . A sense of disconnection settled heavily in the center of her chest as she stood in her beloved free clinic- which was in its unfortunate last days because of a lack of funding . This was her most recent , and most disappointing battle . And , as hard as it was to admit , this was the first time she 'd met an obstacle she 'd been unable to overcome . The clinic had been the sole reason she 'd put up with the infuriating internal politics of her paying job at Boston General 's emergency room . For a long moment , she remained still , waiting for the unsettling feeling to pass . She shoved her hands into her lab coat pockets , staring beyond the clinic 's crowded waiting area , out the large storefront window . Windwhipped sleet was icing over everything with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm just compounded her sense of floundering . Seeking that inner spark that had always propelled her forward , she closed her eyes . She felt the swirl of motion around her , as if the rest of the world kicked into fast forward while she remained stuck in pause . She heard the crying babies , the quiet comforting murmurs of mothers , the motor noises made by a little boy near the front window pushing his matchbox car on the scarred , dark pine table . " Dr. Boudreau ! " A shout yanked her away from her battle with self-doubt . Carmen , the girl working the sign-in desk , had jumped from her chair to support Sarah Morgan , one of the few patients Molly saw here on a regular basis . Sarah had come to the clinic over six months ago for prenatal care . Molly had seen right away that she was different from the free clinic 's usual maternity cases . For one thing , she was n't a teen mother , or on her fifth pregnancy before her thirtieth birthday . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . She appeared well educated and was well dressed , yet utterly guarded about the details of her life-Molly had quickly deduced a woman in hiding . Sarah had seemed as isolated and lonely as Molly . Molly 's isolation was a by-product of her impossible schedule ; she quickly learned that Sarah 's was strictly self-imposed . Still , Molly saw a kindred spirit in Sarah 's determination and independence . Upon Sarah 's invitation after her second visit to the clinic , they had forged a fragile friendship over coffee and conversation after clinic hours . Molly liked Sarah 's quick wit and indomitable spirit . They had grown as close as two women could in their unusual situation . Sarah had been completely secretive about her past , the baby 's father , or anything else that might have given Molly a clue to the reason she was living as she was . Even so , Molly felt they were friends ; she might not know about the woman 's past , but she knew what kind of person Sarah was inside . Now , as Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly in labor . Wrapping her arm around Sarah 's back , Molly helped move her as quickly as possible toward the examination rooms . " I thought I told you to go straight to the hospital ! " Sarah 's knees wobbled and she groaned with a contraction . " Has your water broken ? " Molly asked . Sarah nodded once , her pale blond hair falling over her face . Then in a breathy whisper she said , " About two o'clock this morning . " " Jesus . " It was nearly noon . Molly knew that Sarah had a serious aversion to hospitals , but she had no idea it was so severe it would eclipse her common sense . " You should have called 911-how in the hell did you get here ? " " Taxi . " Perspiration beaded on Sarah 's brow as they settled her onto an examination table . Molly turned to Carmen and said quietly , " Get an EMS unit here now ! " Carmen hustled from the room . " All right now , Sarah , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly quickly swept her dark hair up into a pony tail to keep it out of the way . When she examined Sarah , she was stunned to see the baby was crowning . Even if the EMS was in the bay and ready to respond , it was doubtful that they could transport Sarah to the hospital before delivery . Sarah started to push . " Do n't push yet . Take deep breaths . " Molly took a couple herself to calm her voice before she spoke again . " Looks like we 're going to have this baby right here . " Through pinched lips , Sarah said , " Good . " Molly 's mouth went dry . Sarah did n't understand the risks . Molly had specialized in pediatrics . Under normal circumstances , with the proper medicine and equipment available she would feel confident in treating the baby once delivered . In this financially strapped clinic she had neither . Plus she 'd never done a delivery alone , only assisted a couple of times during her rotation in OB/GYN . What if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby was n't breech . Should she do an episiotomy ? Was it too late for that ? She wanted to chastise Sarah for not going to the hospital where emergency equipment and obstetric specialists were plentiful . She wanted someone to stand over her shoulder and tell her she was doing everything right . But deep down , she could n't deny the little rush that was building . This baby was coming-and Sarah depended upon Molly to keep both her and her child safe . It was all in Molly 's well-trained , if ill-equipped , hands . Inclining the head of the table and placing a couple of pillows under Sarah 's shoulders , Molly pulled on gloves and said , " All right , next contraction , push . " She positioned herself to deliver the baby , listening for the scream of an approaching siren . Sarah bore down with the next contraction . The baby 's head pushed forward , then retreated slightly when the contraction was over . Without a fetal monitor , Molly could n't begin to tell if this baby was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible complications raced through her mind . Come on , she thought , babies were born for thousands of years without modern medicine . And lots of them died . Molly shook off the thought . She coached Sarah through three more contractions . Where was that damn EMS ? " Carmen ! " The girl came rushing back in with the cordless phone still in her hand . She looked as panicked as Molly felt . " They 've got one unit in a ditch . And all others are dispatched- the storm .... " " Try Mass General . " " I already have . They said they 're having to prioritize . They 're working a bus accident on I-93 right now . " Molly gave her a quick nod . " Keep after them . " Then to Sarah , " You 're doing great . We should have this little one here very shortly . " Sarah had already told Molly that she had no family and the father did n't know of the baby 's existence . Perhaps she 'd reconsider telling him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sarah was between contractions . Her voice quivered as she said , " No one . Promise me- " Her voice strangled to a groan as she bore down with a contraction . The baby 's head slid into Molly 's hands ; she rotated it slightly to the side , allowing the fluid to run from its mouth . Immediately she saw there was trouble . " I need you to stop pushing . Breathe through the next contraction . " " What 's wrong ? " Panic gave Sarah 's voice new strength . " What 's wrong with my baby ? " Molly did n't answer , she had to concentrate on what she was doing . The cord was wrapped around the baby 's neck . Everything was so slippery , the baby 's neck so short , she could n't get her finger under the cord . Sarah started to groan . " Do n't push , Sarah . Breathe ! " If the baby moved farther down the birth canal , the cord was going to cut off oxygen . Statistics of previously normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly 's head . Seconds mattered . Sarah huffed exaggerated breaths , fighting the urge to push . The contraction lessened . Sarah blew out a long shuddering breath . " Good girl ! " Molly made another try at getting her finger between the baby 's neck and the cord . This time she was successful , but her grip was tenuous . With the slightest movement , she could lose it . She was ready to try and slide the cord over the baby 's head when Sarah had another contraction . " Breathe ! Do n't push . " She did n't think Sarah was pushing , but the cord tightened around her finger anyway . " Carmen ! " The girl ran into the room . In a calm voice Molly said , " Be ready to hand me that bulb syringe . " Carmen quickly pulled on gloves and picked up the syringe . Molly hoped Sarah did n't see the wild-eyed fear in the girl 's face . The contraction relaxed . Molly 's brow beaded with perspiration and she held her breath as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the cord slipped from her grasp , she 'd have to wait through another contraction . More risk . Quickly , Molly moved the cord over the baby 's head . In a rush of relief , she finally took a breath . Carmen put the bulb syringe into Molly 's outstretched hand . She suctioned the mouth and nose . " Okay , push with the next one . We 're ready for the shoulders . " To Carmen she said , " Get several towels ready . " In three minutes , the baby was delivered . " A boy ! " Carmen shouted excitedly . " A baby boy ! " Silence followed . Molly laid the baby face down across her forearm and slapped the bottom of his feet . Nothing . She again suctioned the blue-tinged mouth , then rubbed his back vigorously with a towel . Carmen stood watching with huge eyes and open mouth . Sarah started to cry , a pitiful , helpless thin whine of fear . " Come on . Breathe , " Molly whispered as she slapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to cry like a hungry kitten . " That 's it ! " Molly wrapped him in a towel and laid him , squalling , on Sarah 's chest . Sarah repeated over and over , as if to reassure herself , " He 's okay . He 's okay . " " He 's better than okay . He 's great , " Molly said , cutting the cord and watching the baby 's color improve by the second . She looked to Carmen . " Get back on the phone . We need the neonatal unit to check him out and give him his walking papers . And Sarah needs a once over by an OB/GYN . " " How much do you think he weighs ? " Sarah asked . " I 'd guess at least seven and a half pounds-a good , healthy size . " She massaged Sarah 's abdomen to deliver the placenta . The danger to the baby was past , but until she was certain there was n't going to be any immediate bleeding problem , Molly kept her attention close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , " Sarah said with wonder in her voice . " I expected him to be bald as a billiard ball . I did n't have enough hair to hold a barrette until I was three . " Molly , preoccupied with her work , responded absently , " Must take after his father . " It was n't until she realized Sarah had n't responded that she grasped what she 'd said . " Sorry . " " His father was a redhead . " Surprised , Molly looked at Sarah 's face . This was the very first thing she 'd ever said about the father . Sarah had acted as if there was no father . " Oh . " " You think I 'm terrible . But his father is ... dangerous ... evil . I ca n't ever , ever let him near Nicholas . I wo n't put him on the birth certificate . I do n't want there to be any link to that man . " There was a certain panicked vehemence in Sarah 's voice that Molly thought bordered on hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circumstances had led her to believe that Sarah had been a victim of domestic violence , hiding away from an abusive husband or lover . Sarah herself had been as secretive as a mummy , not divulging the slightest detail of her past . But she had that haunted look about her , a humming tension , a jittery fear that never quite left her eyes . Molly had seen it dozens of times . But she had never heard even the most battered of women refer to her child 's father as " evil . " Surely Sarah 's emotions were talking , the primal combination of protective new motherhood and raging hormones . " You 've named him Nicholas , then ? " " Yes . Nicholas James . " " After anyone in particular ? " Molly fished . Sarah shook her head , but kept her gaze on her baby 's face . " He 's a person unto himself , a new start . He wo n't take after anyone . " There was a certain stony conviction in her words that made Molly reconsider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been straining to hear finally pulled up outside . " Sounds like your chariot has arrived . " " I do n't really have to go to the hospital , do I ? I 'm fine . Nicholas is fine . " " I think you 're both fine . But it 's always a good idea to have a newborn under close observation for the first few hours . Besides , unless you have someone who can stay with you , I do n't want you to go home yet . But if there 's someone I can call .... " Something shifted behind Sarah 's innocent blue eyes . Suddenly she looked much younger than twenty-nine . " No . I 'm alone . " Then she smiled warmly and cuddled the baby closer . " Or at least I was until now . " Molly looked on , wondering what that connection must be like , having a human being completely created within your own body . And now that human being was a life force of its own , yet relying on you for every need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , she 'd had surgery to remove a tumor from her cervix . It had been more extensive than the surgical team had anticipated . The prognosis for Molly 's carrying a child to term was n't good . As she gave Sarah 's hand one last squeeze before the paramedics rolled her out of the clinic , she wondered if this would be as close as she 'd ever get to the birth experience . Molly finished out her day with a satisfied buzz in her veins . Holding new life in her hands had helped eclipse the bleakness that had threatened to swamp her earlier- had pushed the dissatisfaction back behind the black curtain . Finally , the last patient was out the door and she was free to go to the hospital and see Sarah and the baby . Continues ...
