He revealed that he has only recently begun dating someone , whom he would not identify . He and Janet last talked about a month ago . He said it was just a short conversation about their divorce . Their marriage remained one of the best-kept secrets in Hollywood . " I was surprised we kept it a secret so long , " he admitted . Jackson 's older sister , Rebbie Jackson , once told an Atlanta radio station in 1998 that Janet and Rene " had been warned for a long time .... they eloped years ago .

" What 's amazing is our close friends and business associates did know about it ... but I guess they all felt loyal to our relationship and respected our approach to preserving it , " he noted . They were separated in January 1999 , according to the divorce petition . They wanted to keep their marriage a secret because of the pressures famous couples often experience . " We decided early on that we wanted to preserve our marriage by keeping it private . We noticed that couples that are always in the media seem to break up quickly in Hollywood . That was our perception and we were together 14 years in Hollywood , " he said , adding that it is almost unheard of in show business .

" Photograph Photograph // Elizondo was a key part of Jackson 's career and gave her advice on her many show business offers and pursuits . They were like soul mates-they shared it all , observers say . Some detractors , however , have tried to question Elizondo 's motives , because he had so much input and control in Jackson 's career . Elizondo told JET : " I guess stuff like that will be said when you are as deeply involved as I was . But I do n't think I ever brought any harm to her career . I was not afraid to tell her when she was wrong , whereas most people once you get to that level of success become yes people , ' and I was always forthright with her . " Jackson always stood by her man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Rolling Stone : " Re has been my co-writer on almost all my songs since Rhythm Nation but refused to take credit . He wanted to prove that he was n't with me to take , but to give . I appreciated that attitude , but I also saw that it was leading to feelings of fraudulence  --  on his part , not mine . On Velvet Rope , Rene 's name appears for the first time as coexecutive producer and co-writer . Just as it 's wrong to claim undeserved credit , it 's wrong to deny credit when it 's deserved . " When they ended their relationship last year ( JET , March 8,1999 ) , Jackson released a brief statement that said : " Janet Jackson and partner Rene Elizondo Jr . have separated amicably .

We were best friends . Then , when I was 20 , it was the strangest thing when we started being attracted to each other . I felt like I was sinning somehow or something . It might sound strange , but we were such good friends . But , I think those are the best relationships , when you are friends first .
