Olga Arias , 46 , knows what it 's like to be obese . " Ever since I was a kid , I was probably always chunky , " she says . " Every year I would just gain weight . " By the time the 5-ft. 5-in . San Francisco city worker was 34 , she tipped the scales at 260 lbs . " I was self-conscious about everything  --  getting on a bus , sitting in an airplane seat , " she recalls . " I would put off seeing doctors , I was so embarrassed . " <P> Like millions of other plus-size Americans , Arias had tried a couple of times to lose weight  --  only to regain every pound she shed and then some . Finally , one August day in 1992 , she says , " something just clicked . I knew I had to do something . " Arias started swimming at a local pool and limiting what she ate . At first , she did n't tell anyone what she was doing because she feared she might fail again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lbs. , people at work started to notice and compliment her efforts . After two years , she had lost more than 100 lbs .  --  and she has kept the weight off . <P> What is Arias ' secret ? She did n't undergo gastric-bypass surgery . She did n't do Atkins , South Beach or any other diet plan . What she did was buy a couple of books that listed the nutritional value and calorie content of the foods she ate , including prepared items . Then she gave up fried foods and alcohol , began preparing her own meals and loaded up on fruits and vegetables . Finally , she started moving  --  first by joining a swimming pool , then walking , hiking , biking , even surfing for a while . To this day , she limits what she eats , exercises at least an hour a day and steps on the bathroom scales every morning to make sure her weight does n't creep back up . <P> Arias ' success story qualified her to join the National Weight Control Registry , a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and kept them off for at least a year . The registry was founded in 1993 by James Hill , an obesity researcher at the University of Colorado , and Rena Wing , a behavioral psychologist at Brown University , and although it 's a self-selected group of self-described " successful losers , " it has taught researchers quite a bit about how to achieve long-term weight loss . Today there are 5,000 Americans listed in the registry , and their stories are an inspiration to anyone who has ever struggled with a weight problem . " On average they have lost 70 lbs . and kept it off at least six years , " Wing says . What are the secrets of their success ? Some of them may surprise you . <P> Probably the most unexpected result is that there is no consensus about the best way to lose weight . Half the registrants shed the pounds on their own ; the other half enrolled in a program or went to a nutritionist . Some participants emphasized protein , others a low-fat diet . But most chose some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical activity . <P> Clear trends emerged when it came to maintaining that weight loss . The first thing they all did was get off the couch . Even after they had reached their target weight , participants continued to spend an hour a day  --  often more  --  most days of the week , in some type of vigorous physical activity . Walking was the most popular , but practically everyone added at least one other sport or activity .
