Corin Tucker , singer and guitarist for the great punk trio Sleater-Kinney , was talking about the night she crossed paths with the Backstreet Boys . " They were recording in the same studio . It was "  --  in a perfect mall-rat accent  --  " we 're definitely meeting them . For sure . We met the one , I think his name is Kevin . " She was asked whether the pop star treated her as if she were a besotted fan or another musician . " Well ! " Tucker said . " Total besotted fan . He did n't see me as a musician at all . He does n't know who I am . He 'd never listen to Sleater-Kinney . " <P> Sleater-Kinney , composed of Tucker , 28 , guitarist-singer Carrie Brownstein , 26 , and drummer-singer Janet Weiss , 35 , is a punk band because , among other reasons , a sense of exclusion and marginalization is part of what drives its music . That sense is a source of the vehemence in the trio 's sound , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chainsaw and Kill Rock Stars  --  has become at once bigger and more agile , harsher and more unpredictable , since the band formed in 1994 in Olympia , Wash . The world is organized so as not to have to listen to songs as frightening and fast as Youth Decay , from last year 's album All Hands on the Bad One , and there are thousands of people living in the world desperate to hear a song so unafraid of its own noise , to go to a show precisely to feel unafraid of the noise that they themselves might make . <P> On the radio , a Sleater-Kinney song throws everything around it off balance , the way a Smokey Robinson composition like The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage can make whatever might play before or after it seem stupid . " It can be thrilling and scary at the same time , " Weiss says of hearing the band 's music on the radio , which , on commercial stations , almost never happens . " To be involved in that  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Tucker has an almost unnaturally huge voice , but when momentum builds inside a Sleater-Kinney rhythm and then arrives like a flash flood , the sound makes Tucker 's seem the only appropriate voice to speak of what 's at stake : in Youth Decay , love and hate , life and death . <P> Sleater-Kinney also plays any number of light , happy tunes that do n't threaten anybody  --  that 's what one is supposed to say after talking about a song like Youth Decay , to take the edge off . But with Sleater-Kinney the edge is never off . It 's what the band was created to pursue : " 2001 will be a space odyssey for us , and we wo n't ... be here , " Brownstein said from the stage at Sleater-Kinney 's most recent show , last November in San Francisco . In the midst of their brief hiatus , Brownstein , Tucker and Weiss remain off the radio but on the mind of the pop world , and plotting their return . <P> Greil Marcus is a columnist for   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
