" I am dead . They killed me as well . " The old woman 's words cut straight to my heart . " Please tell me what happened that day . " Maria spoke so softly I had to strain to catch the Spanish . " I kissed the little ones and left for market . " Eyes down , voice toneless . " I did not know that I would never see them again . " K'akchiquel to Spanish , then reversing the linguistic loop , reversing again as answers followed questions . The translation did nothing to blunt the horror of the recitation . " When did you return home , Seora Ch'i'p ? " " A que hora regreso usted a su casa , Seora Ch'i'p ? " " Chike ramaj xatzalij pa awachoch , Ixoq Ch'i'p ? " " Late afternoon . I 'd sold my beans . " " The house was burning ? " " Yes . " " Your family was inside ? " A nod . I watched the speakers . An ancient Mayan woman , her middle-aged son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memory too terrible for words . I felt anger and sorrow clash inside me like the thunderheads building on the horizon . " What did you do ? " " We buried them in the well . Quickly , before the soldiers came back . " I studied the old woman . Her face was brown corduroy . Her hands were calloused , her long braid more gray than black . Fabric lay folded atop her head , bright reds , pinks , yellows , and blues , woven into patterns older than the mountains around us . One corner rose and fell with the wind . The woman did not smile . She did not frown . Her eyes met no one 's , to my relief . I knew if they lingered on mine even briefly , the transfer of pain would be brutal . Maybe she understood that and averted her gaze to avoid drawingothers into the hell those eyes concealed . Or perhaps it was distrust . Perhaps the things she had seen made her unwilling to look frankly into unknown faces . Feeling dizzy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surroundings . I was six thousand feet up in the western highlands of Guatemala , at the bottom of a steep-sided gorge . The village of Chupan Ya . Between the Mountains . About one hundred and twenty-five kilometers northwest of Guatemala City . Around me flowed a wide river of green , lush forest interspersed with small fields and garden plots , like islands . Here and there rows of man-made terraces burst through the giant checkerboard , cascading downward like playful waterfalls . Mist clung to the highest peaks , blurring their contours into Monet softness . I 'd rarely seen surroundings so beautiful . The Great Smoky Mountains . The Gatineau , Quebec , under northern lights . The barrier islands off the Carolina coast . Haleakula volcano at dawn . The loveliness of the backdrop made the task at hand even more heartbreaking . As a forensic anthropologist , it is my job to unearth and study the dead . I identify the burned , the mummified , the decomposed , and the skeletonized who might otherwise go to anonymous graves . Sometimes the identifications are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can confirm a suspected ID . In some cases , I figure out how these people died . Or how their corpses were mutilated . I am used to the aftermath of death . I am familiar with the smell of it , the sight of it , the idea of it . I have learned to steel myself emotionally in order to practice my profession . But the old woman was breaking through my determined detachment . Another wave of vertigo . The altitude , I told myself , lowering my head and breathing deeply . Though my home bases are North Carolina and Quebec , where I serve as forensic anthropologist to both jurisdictions , I 'd volunteered to come to Guatemala for one month as temporary consultant to the Fundacin de Antropologa Forense de Guatemala . The Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation , FAFG , was working to locate and identify the remains of those who vanished during the 1962 to 1996 civil war , one of the bloodiest conflicts in Latin American history . I 'd learned a lot since my arrival one week before . Estimates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bulk of the slaughter was carried out by the Guatemalan army and by paramilitary organizations affiliated with the army . Most of those killed were rural peasants . Many were women and children . Typically , victims were shot or slashed with machetes . Villages were not always as fortunate as Chupan Ya . There they 'd had time to hide their dead . More often , bodies were buried in unmarked mass graves , dumped in rivers , left under the ruins of huts or houses . Families were given no explanations , no lists of those missing , no records . A UN Commission for Historical Clarification referred to these massacres as a genocide of the Mayan people . Families and neighbors referred to their missing members as the " desaparecidos . " The disappeared . The FAFG was trying to find them , or , more accurately , their remains . And I had come to help . Here in Chupan Ya , soldiers and civil patrollers had entered on an August morning in 1982 . Fearing they 'd be accused of collaborating with the local guerrilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told to gather with their children at designated farms . Trusting , or perhaps fearing , the military , they obeyed . When the soldiers located the women where they 'd been sent , they raped them for hours , then killed them along with their kids . Every house in the valley was burned to the ground . Survivors spoke of five mass graves . Twenty-three women and children were said to lie at the bottom of the well behind Seora Ch'i'p . The old woman continued her story . Over her shoulder I could see the structure we 'd erected three days earlier to protect the well site from rain and sun . Backpacks and camera cases hung from metal uprights , and tarps covered the opening of the pit beneath . Boxes , buckets , shovels , picks , brushes , and storage containers lay as we 'd left them early that morning . Rope had been strung from pole to pole around the excavation to create a boundary between spectators and workers . Inside the restraint sat three idle members of the FAFG team . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence . And the police guards who 'd been told to shut us down . We 'd been close to uncovering evidence when we received the order to halt . The soil had begun yielding ash and cinders . Its color had changed from mahogany to graveyard black . We 'd found a child 's hair clip in the sifting screen . Fragments of cloth . A tiny sneaker . Dear God . Did the old woman 's family really lie only inches below the point at which we 'd stopped ? Five daughters and nine grandchildren . Shot , macheted , and burned in their home together with neighboring women and children . How does one endure such loss ? What could life offer her but endless pain ? Shifting my gaze back to the surrounding countryside , I noted half a dozen farmsteads carved out of the foilage . Adobe walls , tile roofs , smoke curling from cooking fires . Each had a dirt yard , outdoor privy , and an emaciated brown dog or two . The wealthier had chickens , a scrawny hog , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cluster of huts halfway up the eastern escarpment . Another had lived on top , where we 'd parked the FAFG vehicles . These women were married ; she did n't remember their ages . Their babies were three days , ten months , two , four , and five years old . Her youngest daughters were still at home . They 'd been eleven and thirteen . Families , connected by a network of footpaths , and by a network of genes . Their world was this valley . I imagined Seora Ch'i'p returning that day , perhaps descending the same dirt trail our team struggled down each morning and up each evening . She had sold her beans . She was probably happy . Then horror . Two decades is not long enough to forget . A lifetime is not long enough . I wondered how often she thought of them . Did their phantoms walk with her as she trudged to market , following the same course she 'd taken the fatal day ? Did they slip past the tattered rag covering her window when darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams ? Did they come to her smiling and laughing as they 'd been in life ? Or bloodied and charred as she 'd found them in death ? My vision blurred , and I dropped my head again , stared at the dirt . How was it possible for human beings to do that to other human beings ? To helpless and unresisting women and children ? In the distance , I heard the rumble of thunder . Seconds , maybe years later , the interview stopped , an untranslated question left dangling in space . When I looked up Maria and her interpreter had shifted their attention to the hill behind me . Seora Ch'i'p remained focused on her sandals , hand to cheek , fingers curled like a newborn 's . " Mateo 's back , " said Elena Norvillo , an FAFG member from the El Petn region . I turned as she pushed to her feet . The rest of the team observed from under the tent . Two men were working their way down one of the many footpaths that meandered through the gorge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . Though I could n't read them from where I sat , I knew the letters above his brim said FAFG . The six of us waiting wore identical caps . The man following was suited and tied and carried a collapsible chair . We watched the pair pick their way through scraggly corn surrounded by a half dozen subsidiary crops , careful to damage nothing . A bean seedling . A potato plant . Minor to us , but critical food or income to the family that owned it . When they drew within twenty yards , Elena shouted . " Did you get it ? " Mateo gave a thumbs-up . The injunction to suspend excavation had come from a local magistrate . According to his interpretation of the exhumation order , no work was to proceed outside the presence of a judge , the Guatemalan equivalent of a district attorney . Visiting early this morning and finding no judge on site , the magistrate had ordered digging halted . Mateo had gone to Guatemala City to have this ruling overturned . Mateo led his companion directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police , and produced a document . The older cop shifted the strap of his semiautomatic , took the paper and read , head down , shiny black bill reflecting the dimming afternoon light . His partner stood with foot thrust forward , a bored expression on his face . After a brief exchange with the suited visitor , the senior cop returned the order to Mateo and nodded . The villagers watched , silent but curious , as Juan , Luis , and Rosa stood and exchanged high fives . Mateo and his companion joined them at the well . Elena followed . Crossing to the tent , I glanced again at Seora Ch'i'p and her adult son . The man was scowling , hatred seeping from every pore . Hatred for whom ? I wondered . For those who had butchered his family ? For those who had come from a different world to disturb their bones ? For distant authorities who would block even that small effort ? For himself for having survived that day ? His mother stood woodenly , face impassive . Mateo introduced the suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney 's office . The Guatemala City judge had ruled that Amado 's presence would satisfy the requirements of the exhumation order . Amado would be with us for the duration , observing and recording in order to validate the quality of work for the court . Amado shook hands with each of us , moved to a corner of the covered area , unfolded his chair , and sat . Mateo began issuing orders . " Luis , Rosa , please sift . Tempe and I will dig . Juan , haul dirt . We 'll rotate as needed . " Mateo had a small , V-shaped scar on his upper lip that broadened into a U whenever he smiled . Today , the V remained narrow as a spike . " Elena , document and photograph . Skeletal inventory , artifact inventory , photo log . Every molecule goes on record . " " Where are Carlos and Molly ? " asked Elena . Carlos Menzes was a member of an Argentine human rights organization who 'd been advising the FAFG since its formation in 1992 . Molly Carraway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're driving the other truck out here for transport . We 'll need another vehicle when we 're ready to leave with all the equipment and artifacts . " He glanced at the sky . " The storm is two hours off , maybe three if we 're lucky . Let 's find these people before there 's more legal bullshit . " As I collected trowels and placed them in a bucket tied to a length of rope , Mateo zipped the court order into his pack and hung it over a crossbar . His eyes and hair were black , his body a fire hydrant , short and thick . Tubes of muscle bulged in his neck and arms as he and Luis flung back the tarps covering the mouth of the excavation . Mateo placed a boot on the first of the dirt steps we 'd terraced into a pit wall . Edges crumbled , sending dirt two meters to the floor below . The cascading particles made soft , ticking sounds as Mateo slowly climbed down . When he reached bottom , I lowered the bucket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . May was pleasant in the highlands , but underground the clammy cold knifed straight to your marrow . I 'd left Chupan Ya each evening chilled through , my digits numb . I descended as Mateo had done , placing my feet sideways , testing each makeshift tread . My pulse accelerated as the gloom closed around me . Mateo held up a hand and I took it . Stepping off the last riser , I stood in a hole no more than six feet square . The walls and floor were slick , the air dank and rotten . My heart thumped below my sternum . A bead of sweat raced down the furrow overlying my spine . Always in narrow , dark places . I turned from Mateo , pretended to clean my trowel . My hands trembled . Closing my eyes , I fought past the claustrophobia . I thought of my daughter . Katy as a toddler . Katy at the University of Virginia . Katy at the beach . I pictured my cat , Birdie . My townhouse in Charlotte . My condo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop into my mind . Neil Young . " Harvest Moon . " I ran through the lyrics . My breathing eased . My heart slowed . I opened my eyes and checked my watch . Fifty-seven seconds . Not as good as yesterday . Better than Tuesday . Much better than Monday . Mateo was already on his knees , scraping the damp earth . I moved to the opposite corner of the pit , and for the next twenty minutes we worked in silence , troweling , inspecting the ground , scooping dirt into buckets . Objects emerged with increasing frequency . A shard of glass . A chunk of metal . Charred wood . Elena bagged and recorded each item . Noise reached us from the world above . Banter . A request . The bark of a dog . Now and then I 'd glance up , unconsciously reassuring my id . Faces peered down . Men in gaucho hats , women in traditional Mayan weaves , toddlers clinging to their skirts . Babies stared with round , black eyes , secured to their mothers by rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black hair , sienna skin . On one upward glance I noticed a little girl , arms above her head , fingers curled around the restraining rope . Typical kid . Chubby cheeks , dirty feet , ponytails . A stab of pain . The child was the same age as one of Seora Ch'i'p 's granddaughters . Her hair was bound with barrettes identical to the one we 'd found in the screen . I smiled . She turned her face and pressed it to her mother 's legs . A brown hand reached down and stroked her head . According to witnesses , the hole in which we worked had been intended as a cistern . Begun but never completed , it was hastily transformed into an unmarked grave on the night of the massacre . A grave for people identical to those keeping vigil above . Fury swirled in me as I resumed digging . Focus , Brennan . Channel your outrage to uncover evidence . Do that which you are able to do . Ten minutes later my trowel touched something hard . Laying the implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object was slender , like a pencil , with an angled neck ending in a corrugated upper surface . Above the neck , a tiny cap . Surrounding neck and cap , a circular cup . I sat back on my heels and studied my find . A femur and pelvis . The hip of a child no older than two . I looked up , and my gaze met that of the little girl . Again she whipped away . But this time she turned back , peeked through the folds of her mother 's skirt , smiled shyly . Sweet Jesus in heaven . Tears burned the back of my lids . " Mateo . " I pointed at the little bones . Mateo crawled to my corner . Along most of its length , the femur was mottled gray and black from exposure to fire and smoke . The distal end was crumbly white , suggesting more intense burning . For a moment neither of us spoke . Then Mateo crossed himself and said in a low voice , " We 've got them . " When Mateo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of the well . A fleeting thought . We 've got whom , Mateo ? We 've got the victims , not the assassins . What chance is there that any of these government-sanctioned butchers will ever face charges , let alone be punished ? Elena tossed down a camera , then a plastic marker stamped with the numeral " 1 . " I positioned the case number and took several shots . Mateo and I went back to troweling , the others to sifting and hauling . After an hour I took my turn at the screen . Another hour , and I climbed back down into the well . The storm held off , and the cistern told its story . The child had been one of the last lowered into the clandestine grave . Under and around it lay the remains of others . Some badly burned , others barely singed . By late afternoon seven case numbers had been assigned , and five skulls stared out from a tangle of bones . Three of the victims were adults , at least two were adolescents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , age estimation was impossible . At dusk , I made a discovery that will stay with me the rest of my life . For over an hour I 'd been working on skeleton number five . I 'd exposed the skull and lower jaw and cleared dirt from the vertebrae , ribs , pelvis , and limbs . I 'd traced the legs , found the foot bones mingled with those of the person beside . Skeleton five was female . The orbits lacked heavy ridges , the cheekbones were smooth and slender , the mastoids small . The lower half of the body was enveloped in remnants of a rotted skirt identical to a dozen above my head . A coroded wedding band circled one fragile phalange . Though the colors were faded and stained , I could make out a pattern in material adhering to the upper torso . Between the arm bones , atop the collapsed rib cage , lay a bundle with a different design . Cautiously , I separated a corner , eased my fingertips underneath , and teased back the outer layer of fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to examine the contents of a burlap bag found on the shore of an inland lake . From the bag I withdrew several rocks , and bones so fragile at first I thought they were those of a bird . I was wrong . The sack held the remains of three kittens , weighted down and heaved into the water to drown . My disgust was so powerful I had to flee the lab and walk several miles before resuming work . Inside the bundle clutched by skeleton five , I found an arch of tiny vertebral disks with a miniature rib cage curving around it . Arm and leg bones the size of matches . A minute jaw . Seora Ch'i'p 's infant grandchild . Among the paper-thin cranial fragments , a 556 projectile , the type fired by an assault rifle . I remembered how I 'd felt at the slaughter of kittens , but this time I felt rage . There were no streets to walk here at the gravesite , no way to work off my anger . I stared at the little bones , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could he sleep at night ? How could he face people in the day ? At six Mateo gave the order to quit . Up top the air smelled of rain , and veins of lightning pulsated inside heavy , black clouds . The locals had gone . Moving quickly , we covered the well , stored the equipment we would leave behind , and loaded up that which we would carry . As the team worked , rain began plinking in large , cold drops on the temporary roof above our heads . Amado , the DA 's representative , waited with lawn chair folded , face unreadable . Mateo signed the chain of custody book over to the police guards , then we set off through the corn , winding one behind another like ants on a scent trail . We 'd just begun our long , steep climb when the storm broke . Hard , driving rain stung my face and drenched my hair and clothes . Lightning flashed . Thunder boomed . Trees and cornstalks bent in the wind . Within minutes , water sluiced down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown stream of mud . Again and again I lost my footing , hitting hard on one knee , then the other . I crawled upward , right hand clawing at vegetation , left hand dragging a bag of trowels , feet scrambling for traction . Though rain and darkness obscured my vision , I could hear others above and below me . Their hunched forms whitened each time lightning leapt across the sky . My legs trembled , my chest burned . An eon later I crested the ridge and dragged myself onto the patch of earth where we 'd left the vehicles eleven hours earlier . I was placing shovels in the bed of a pickup when Mateo 's satellite phone sounded , the ring barely audible above the wind and rain . " Can someone get that ? " Mateo shouted . Slipping and sliding toward the cab , I grabbed his pack , dug out the handset , and clicked on . " Tempe Brennan , " I shouted . " Are you still at the site ? " English . It was Molly Carraway , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull out . It 's raining like hell , " I shouted , backhanding water from my eyes . " It 's dry here . " " Where are you ? " " Just outside Solol . We were late leaving . Listen , we think we 're being followed . " " Followed ? " " A black sedan 's been on our ass since Guatemala City . Carlos tried a couple of maneuvers to lose it , but the guy 's hanging on like a bad cold . " " Can you tell who 's driving ? " " Not really . The glass is tinted an  --  " I heard a loud thump , a scream , then static , as though the phone had been dropped and was rolling around . " Jesus Christ ! " Carlos 's voice was muted by distance . " Molly ? " I heard agitated words that I could n't make out . " Molly , what is it ? " Shouts . Another thump . Scraping . A car horn . A loud crunch . Male voices . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No response . A shouted command . " Fuck you ! " Carlos . " Molly ! Tell me what 's going on ! " I was almost screaming . The others had stopped loading to stare at me . " No ! " Molly Carraway spoke from a distant galaxy , her voice small and tinny and filled with panic . " Please . No ! " Two muted pops . Another scream . Two more pops . Dead air .
