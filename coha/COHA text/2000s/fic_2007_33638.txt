Her stomach clutched at the sight of the water tower hovering above the still , bare trees , a spaceship come to earth . The water tower had been a key landmark in the old family game , although not the landmark . Once you spotted the white disk on its spindly legs , you knew it was time to prepare , like a runner crouched in blocks . On your mark , get set , I see-It had n't started as a game . Spotting the department store nestled in this bend of the Beltway had been a private contest with herself , a way to relieve the tedium of the two-day drive home from Florida . As far back as she could remember , they had made the trip every winter break , although no one in the family enjoyed this visit to Grandmother 's house . Her Orlando apartment was cramped and smelly , her dogs mean , her meals inedible . Everyone was miserable , even their father , especially their father , although he pretended not to be and took great offense if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she undeniably was-stingy , strange , unkind . Still , even he could n't hide his relief as home drew nearer and he sang out each state line as they crossed . Georgia , he growled in a Ray Charles moan . They spent the night there , in a no-name motor court , and leftbefore sunrise , quickly reaching South Carolina- " Nothing could be finah ! " - followed by the long , slow teases of North Carolina and Virginia , where the only points of interest were , respectively , the lunch stop in Durham and the dancing cigarette packs on the billboards outside Richmond . Then finally Maryland , wonderful Maryland , home sweet home Maryland , which asked for only fifty miles or so , barely an hour back then . Today she had needed almost twice that much time to crawl up the parkway , but traffic was thinning now , up to normal speeds . I see-Hutzler 's had been the city 's grandest department store , and it marked the Christmas season by setting up an enormous fake chimney with a Santa poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was he coming or going ? She could never decide . She had taught herself to watch for that flash of red , the promise that home was near , the way certain birds told a sea captain that the shore was within reach . It had been a clandestine ritual , not unlike counting the broken stripes as they disappeared under the front wheels of the car , a practice that quelled the motion sickness she never quite outgrew . Even then , she was tight-lipped when it came to certain information about herself , clear about the distinction between eccentricities that might be interesting and compulsive habits that would mark her as odd as , say , her grandmother . Or , to be absolutely truthful , her father . But the phrase had popped out one day , joyful and unbidden , another secret dialogue with herself escaping into the world : " I see Hutzler 's . " Her father had gotten the significance instantly , unlike her mother and sister . Her father always seemed to understand the layers beneath what she said , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got older . The problem was that he insisted on turning her private homecoming salute into a game , a contest , and what had once been hers alone then had to be shared with the entire family . Her father was big on sharing , on taking what was private and making it communal . He believed in long , rambling family discussions , which he called " rap sessions " in the language of the day , and unlocked doors and casual seminudity , although their mother had broken him of that habit . If you tried to keep something for yourself-whether it was a bag of candy purchased with your own money or a feeling you did n't want to express-he accused you of hoarding . He sat you down , looked straight into your eyes , and told you that families did n't work that way . A family was a team , a unit , a country unto itself , the one part of her identity that would remain constant the rest of her life . " We lock our front door against strangers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So he seized " I see Hutzler 's " for the family good and encouraged everyone to vie for the right to say it first . Once the rest of the family decided to play , that last mile of Beltway had been unbearable in its suspense . The sisters craned their necks , leaning forward in the old lap seat belts , the ones worn only on long trips . That 's how things were back then-seat belts for long trips only , no bicycle helmets ever , skateboards made from splintery planks of wood and old roller skates . Pinned by her seat belt , she felt her stomach flip and her pulse race , and for what ? For the hollow honor of being the first to say out loud what she had always been the first to think . As with all her father 's contests , there was no prize , no point . Since she could no longer be guaranteed victory , she did what she always did : She pretended not to care . Yet here she was again , alone , guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory would be , and her stomach still flipped , unaware that the store was long gone , that everything around the once-familiar cloverleaf had changed . Changed and , yes , cheapened . The placid dowager that had been Hutzler 's was now a tacky Value City . Opposite , on the south side of the highway , the Quality Inn had morphed into one of those storage places . It was n't possible from this vantage point to see if Howard Johnson 's , home of the family 's weekly fish-fry suppers , remained at the intersection , but she somehow doubted it . Did Howard Johnson 's exist anywhere anymore ? Did she ? Yes and no . What happened next transpired in seconds . Everything does , if you think about it . She would say that later , under questioning . The Ice Age happened in a matter of seconds ; there were just a lot of them . Oh , she could make people love her if absolutely necessary , and although the tactic was less essential to her survival now , the habit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could tell she was having the desired effect on most of them . By then her description of the accident was breathlessly vivid , a polished routine . She had glanced to the right , eastward , trying to recall all her childhood landmarks , forgetting the old admonition Bridges may freeze first , and felt a strange sensation , almost as if the steering wheel were slipping from her grasp , but the car was actually separating from the road , losing traction , although the sleet had not started and the pavement looked bone dry . It was oil , not ice , she would learn later , left from an earlier accident . How could one control for a coating of oil , invisible in the March twilight , for the inactions or incomplete actions of a crew of men she had never met , would never know ? Somewhere in Baltimore , a man sat down to supper that night , unaware that he had destroyed someone else 's life , and she envied him his ignorance . She clutched the steering wheel and pounded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxy sedan slid to the left , moving like the needle on a haywire tachometer . She bounced off the Jersey wall , spun around , slid to the other side of the highway . For a moment it seemed as if she were the only one driving , as if all the other cars and their drivers had frozen in deference and awe . The old Valiant-the name had seemed a good omen , a reminder of Prince Valiant and all that he stood for , back in the Sunday comics-moved swiftly and gracefully , a dancer among the stolid , earthbound commuters at the tail end of rush hour . And then , just when she seemed to have the Valiant under control , when the tires once again connected to the pavement , she felt a soft thump to her right . She had sideswiped a white SUV , and although her car was so much smaller , the SUV seemed to reel from the touch , an elephant felled by a peashooter . She glimpsed a girl 's face , or thought she did , a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realization that anything could collide with one 's neat , well-ordered life at any time . The girl wore a ski jacket and large , cruelly unflattering glasses , made worse somehow by white fur earmuffs . Her mouth was round , a red gate of wonder . She was twelve , maybe eleven , and eleven was the same age when-and then the white SUV began its lazy flip-flops down the embankment . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , she thought . She knew she should slow down , stop , check on the SUV , but a chorus of honks and squealing brakes rose up behind her , a phalanx of sound that pushed her forward in spite of herself . It was n't my fault ! Everyone should know by now that SUVs were prone to tip . Her mild little nudge could never have caused that dramatic-looking accident . Besides , it had been such a long day and she was so close . Her exit was the next one , not even a mile ahead . She could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination . But once on the long straightaway toward I-70 , she found herself veering right instead of left , toward the sign that read Local Traffic Only , to that strange , unfinished road that her family had always called the highway to nowhere . How they had gloried in giving directions to their house . " Take the interstate east , to where it ends . " " How can an interstate end ? " And her father would triumphantly tell the tale of the protests , the citizens who had united across Baltimore to preserve the park and the wildlife and the then-modest rowhouses that ringed the harbor . It was one of her father 's few successes in life , although he had been a minor player-just another signer of petitions , a marcher in demonstrations . He was never tapped to speak at the public rallies , much as he longed for that role . The Valiant was making a terrible sound , the right rear wheel scraping against what must be a crushed fender . In her agitated state , it made perfect sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleet had now started and she became aware with each step that something was wrong . Her ribs hurt so that each breath was like a jab with a tiny knife , and it was hard to carry her purse as she had always been instructed-close to the body , not dangling from her wrist , a temptation for muggers and thieves . She had n't been wearing her seat belt , and she had bounced around inside the Valiant , hitting the steering wheel and door . There was blood on her face , but she was n't sure where it was coming from . Mouth ? Forehead ? She was warm , she was cold , she saw black stars . No , not stars . More like triangles twisting and turning , strung from the wires of an invisible mobile . She had been walking no more than ten minutes when a patrol car stopped alongside her , lights flashing . " That your Valiant back there ? " the patrolman called out to her , lowering the window on the passenger side but not venturing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated than the young officer could know . Still , she nodded . " You got any ID ? " " Sure , " she said , digging into her purse but not finding her wallet . Why , that- She started to laugh , realizing how perfect that was . Of course she had no ID . She had no identity , not really . " Sorry . No . I- " She could n't stop laughing . " It 's gone . " He got out of the patrol car and attempted to take the purse to look for himself . Her scream shocked her even more than it did him . There was a fiery pain in her left forearm when he tried to slide the purse past her elbow . The patrolman spoke into his shoulder , calling for assistance . He pocketed her keys from her purse , walked back to her car , and poked around inside , then returned and stood with her in the sleeting rain that had finally started . He mumbled some familiar words to her but was otherwise silent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's for a doctor to say when we get you to the ER . " " No , not me . Back there . " The distant whir of a helicopter answered her question . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . But it was n't her fault . " It was n't my fault . I could n't control it-but still , I really did n't do anything- " " I 've read you your rights , " he said . " The things you 're saying-they count . Not that there 's much doubt you left the scene of an accident . " " I was going to get help . " " This road dead-ends into a park-and-ride . If you really wanted to help them , you 'd have pulled over back there or taken the Security Boulevard exit . " " There 's the old Windsor Hills Pharmacy at Forest Park and Windsor Mill . I thought I could call from there . " She could tell that caught him off guard , her use of precise names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of any pharmacy , although there 's a gas station there , but- Do n't you have a cell phone ? " " Not for my personal use , although I carry one at work . I do n't buy things until they work properly , until they 're perfected . Cell phones lose their connections and people have to yell into them half the time , so you ca n't safeguard your privacy . When cells work as well as landlines , I 'll buy one . " She heard her father 's echo . All these years later , he was in her head , his pronouncements as definitive as ever . Do n't be the first to purchase any kind of technology . Keep your knives sharp . Eat tomatoes only when they 're in season . Be kind to your sister . One day your mother and I will be gone , and you 'll be all that each other has . The young patrol officer regarded her gravely , the kind of awed inspection that good children reserve for those who have misbehaved . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this light , in these clothes , the rain flattening her short , spiky curls , she probably looked younger than she was . People were always placing her at a full decade below her real age , even on those rare occasions when she dressed up . Cutting her long hair last year had only made her look younger still . It was funny about her hair , how stubbornly blond it remained at an age when most women needed chemicals to achieve this light , variable hue . It was as if her hair resented its years of forced imprisonment under those home applications of Nice'n Easy Sassy Chestnut . Her hair could hold a grudge as well as she could . " Bethany , " she said . " I 'm one of the Bethany girls . " " What ? " " You do n't know ? " she asked him . " You do n't remember ? But then I guess you 're all of , what-twenty-four ? Twenty-five ? " " I 'll be twenty-six next week , " he said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a toddler claiming two and a half instead of two . At what age do we stop wishing to be older than we are , stop nudging the number up ? Around thirty for most , she assumed , although it had happened to her far earlier . By eighteen she would have done anything to renounce adulthood and be given another chance at childhood . " So you were n't even born when- And you 're probably not from here either , so no , the name would n't mean anything to you . " " Registration in the car says it belongs to Penelope Jackson , from Asheville , North Carolina . That you ? Car did n't come up stolen when I called the tag in . " She shook her head . Her story would be wasted on him . She 'd wait for someone who could appreciate it , who would understand the full import of what she was trying to tell him . Already she was making the calculations that had long been second nature . Who was on her side , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would betray her ?
