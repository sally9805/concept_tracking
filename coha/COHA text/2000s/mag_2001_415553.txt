Tools to help you reach beyond your grasp . // Left to right : Corona mattock/fork from A.M. Leonard ; stirrup hoe and circle hoe from Peaceful Valley ; and triangle hoe from Lady Gardener . // When Archimedes uttered the famous line , " Give me a lever and a place to stand , and I can move the Earth , he was stating a principle of physics . Perhaps unwittingly , he was also describing well-designed garden tools . A tool is a device that extends the human body and multiplies any force exerted . Archimedes ' lever was an extension of his arm that increased the lifting force applied to one end . The same is true for garden tools . Whatever their shape or purpose , garden tools extend some part of your body and multiply the strength applied . For instance , if you squeeze your fingers together and cup your hand slightly , you have formed a spade to dig and scrape . Forge that spade from stone or metal and you can move much more dirt with the same effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort several fold . By this point , you have a trowel . Unfortunately , the handles on most trowels , and on most gardening tools intended for one-handed use , are woefully short . You wind up doing the work instead of the tool doing it for you . I recently witnessed this inefficiency in person , watching a neighbor plant a bed of flower bulbs . For each bulb , he had to forcefully stab the trowel blade into the earth , then twist it several times to create a hole for the bulb . The poor guy was breaking a sweat planting flowers ! A longer handle would have made the job a snap . One-handed gardening tools ( as opposed to those , like a shovel , that require two hands to operate ) fall into five categories : digging blades ( trowels ) ; cutting and scraping blades ( hoes and weeders ) ; forks and cultivators ; rakes ; and multipurpose tools that combine two or more functions . Sometimes the standard six- or seven-inch handle is sufficient for the job at hand , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in length from about ten to 24 inches ; anything more than 32 inches long is difficult to use with one hand . Among the many advantages to long-handled tools : Power transference A long handle // Garden Tools of Mainetrowel and wire rake . // acts as a lever , transferring your energy to the tool and multiplying the effect so you can do more work with less effort . This is not a new idea-he Native-American digging stick is an application of this principle . Balance A longer handle counterbalances the weight of the tool head , making it less fatiguing to use , especially over long periods . Reach Long-handled tools extend the length of your reach , which has many advantages . Obviously , you can reach further without moving . But the longer reach also lets you forage around in areas that might be otherwise difficult to manage . For instance , with the two-foot wire rake from Garden Tools of Maine , you can easily reach deep into a perennial bed to clean out debris , which is nearly impossible to do with a full-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds of thorny plants , such as roses and berries . Control The advantages of long-handied tools might lead you to believe that two-hand-use tools are the way to go . What you get from these in terms of leverage , however , you sacrifice in control , For example , we use a one-handed combination hoe/fork for weeding and cultivating beds . With a full-length version we 'd be all over the lot , but the one-handed tool allows for much greater precision . In addition , we find it less firing to use . We especially like the Corona mattock/fork version from A.M. Leonard , which has an extendible handle . By adjusting the length we can work stand ing up , but still have the control inherent in one-handed tools . Or we can shorten the handle for even better control in tight spaces . The metal handles on these tools extend from 18 to 32 inches with the twist of a wrist . There are five heads available : wire rake ; ma:ock/fork combination ; rake ; trowel ; and three-tined cultivator . Each has a cushioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all too easy to damage plants using unwieldy full-length tools . Stirrup hoes , for instance , are notorious for overcutting and for destroying the roots of tender vegetation . However , with the onehanded version from Peaceful Valley Farm Supply , I can weed and aerate the soil with no danger to my plants . This hoe has a small stirrup blade measuring only three inches across . For weeding in tight spaces , nothing compares to the small circle hoe , also from Peaceful Valley , with its 11-inch-long , thick hardwood handle and two-inch diameter blade . It 's designed to be used with a pulling action , so only the bottom third of the blade is sharpened . Having an accident with this hoe almost requires deliberate effort . Wonderful as they are , long-handled tools can be difficult to find . The few sold by most garden supply stores are often lower-quality tools designed for kids , not for serious gardening tasks , though stores sometimes carry a few cheaply made tools with hollow-metal handles and stamped ( as opposed to forged ) heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many nurseries and garden supply deam ts ( look for the display rack ) . This line includes 12 heads , each with a 12- to 14-inch ferrled hardwood handle and leather hang cord . We especially like the finely tapered triangle hoe , ideal for weeding the cracks between paving stones and digging furrows for small seeds . // The Rogue hoe from Prohoe // This line is clearly marketed toward women , who often find long-handled gardening tools easier to work with than standard tools . But long-handled tools will benefit many gardeners . " We developed these tools with two markets in mind ; the young and the elderly , and/or handicapped who have diffitally reaching the earth with a standard tool , " says Peter Sonderegger , president of Garden Tools of Maine . Arm 's Length , their long-handied line , is especially useful to anyone who gardens from a sitting position . Each tool comes with a two-foot ash handle and leather hang cord . There are five standard , forged heads available : three-tined cultivator , trowel , wire rake , dandelion weeder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long handle . Hoes , the tool most commonly used by home gardeners and farmers alike , constitute the largest category of long-handled garden tools . Although standard hoe blades range two to five inches in width , hoes come in a bewildering array of blade sizes and shapes for general- and special-purpose use . The newest hoe on the scene is the Rogue hand hoe from Prohoe , available through Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds . Basically a one-handed version of their model 70G , the blade is forged from recycled disk hoe blades sharpened on three sides . This hoe does not need to be filed before first use , and can usually make it through a season of heavy use without resharpening . The Rogue sports a 12-inch ferruled hardwood handle and its blade is bent slightly inward , which reduces fatigue . Prohoe , by the way , enjoys a high reputation among farmersthe company deserves better recognition by home gardeners and small market growers . When it comes to elegance , nothing holds a candle to traditional Japanese garden tools , and the hoes are no exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward from the handle . Hida Tool Co. has perhaps the broadest line of traditional Japanese tools . Among those intended for one-handed use are eight designs the company classifies as hoes . Two of these , however , are actually fork-like cultivators , and two combine hoe blades with other tools . Each hoe comes with a 15-inch oak handle and includes a metal wedge . We particularly like the three-inch-wide window hoe , designed to keep soil from building up behind the blade . Hida also offers a heavy duty , three-tined forged cultivator mounted on a 12-inch oak handle , as well as a selection of weeders and scrapers . The V-shaped scraper is particularly useful . Its sharpened , trowel-like blade is mounted at right angles to the 16-inch handle , which makes it ideal for weeding in tight comers and between stones . It also serves as an off-set trowel , perfect for planting bulbs and similar tasks . If you 're willing to search a bit , you 'll find most tools are available with a long handle . Peaceful Valley Farm Supply , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including forks , rakes , hoes and weeders . Ironically , they do not have a trowel . " We agree with your premise that longer-handled trowels would be easier to use and less fatiguing , " concludes technical support specialist Lisa Spang . " But it seems that the purpose of that tool would be better accomplished with a spade or hoe . " Maybe so . But given the diversity of long-handled trowels available , it would seem that many gardeners disagree . // Traditional Japanese tools from Hida Tool Co. ( left to right ) : Window hoe ; V-shaped scraper and three-tined cultivator Sidebar The Short Of It Sidebar Despite the obvious benefits of long-handled garden tools , many gardeners still prefer those with shorter handles . Multipurpose tools-and quite a few head designs-seem to come strictly with Sidebar the short handles . Most Of these tools , however , are configured and balanced in such a way that the short handle is n't a Sidebar handicap . Here are some of my favorites : HORI-HORI If I had to pick only one gardening tool , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Hori-Hor , the deeply dished , six-inch carbon steel blade is attached to a hand-filling hardwood handle . One edge of the blade is sharp , the other is serrated , and the whole thing tapers to a point . All together , Sidebar this tool combines a thin trowel with a knife , a saw and a triangle hoe for weeding in tight spaces . it works beautifully as a transplanting tool . Sidebar A more recent innovation is a stainlesssteel version with a slightly longer ( seven inches ) Sidebar blade and handle , which Sill weighs less than the traditional design . The stainless blade has a depth gauge embossed in IL ANGLE WEEDER The double offset of the Sidebar curved blade on this nifty tool more than makes up for the short handle . The sbc-inch blade has a serrated cutting edge on the inside of the curve and a split tip . Known as the " three-in-one " weeded this design is good for cutting weed roots deep beneath the surface , prying up tap roots with the split tip , or cleaning the cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Angle Weeder is only available in right-handed models . Sidebar SOIL SCOOP Billed as " the do-it-all digging tool , " I the Soil Scoop actually lives up to its marketing descrip tion . Mounted to a six-inch handle is a deep-dish , stainless steel trowel blade that tapers and bends upward into a sharply pointed triangle tip . The balance of both edges are serrated . The Soil Scoop serves all the purposes of a Sidebar trowel , and is sometimes even better than a standard trowel because the deep-dish blade makes it much easier to transfer soil and garden amendments . In addition , the sharp , angled tip makes this tool a good close-quarters weeder that 's also ideal for furrowing and making trenches for bulbs . The Sidebar serrated edges work well for cutting roots , and the overall shape is perfect for digging transplanting holes . Reference Source Guide A.M.
