How the Abramoff case could change Washington <p> So far , the scandal surrounding disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff has produced some vivid and memorable examples of modern Washington graft  --  skybox tickets , pricey restaurant meals , golf junkets to Scotland . Yet at the center of the scandal is something more prosaic , and potentially far more explosive : good old-fashioned campaign donations . Deep in the plea agreements won by Justice Department lawyers are admissions by the defendants  --  Abramoff and his cronies , ex-DeLay aides Tony C. Rudy and Michael Scanlon  --  that they conspired to use campaign contributions to bribe lawmakers . Even though these gifts were fully disclosed and within prescribed limits , the government said they were criminal , and the defendants agreed . This aspect of the case has received little attention . But it is sending shudders down K Street . If such prosecutions were to become commonplace , the paid persuaders of Washington and their big-money clients would be dealt a body blow . If prosecutors begin to assert as a matter of routine that lobbyist gifts and campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a whole new front on the decades-old ( and largely ineffective ) effort to break the nexus of money and politics in the capital . <p> " More than in the past , the Department of Justice seems to be trying very hard to tie campaign contributions to legislative acts by members of Congress and to draw the inference that there 's a criminal connection between the two , " says Robert K. Kelner , chairman of the election law and political law practice at Covington &; Burling . " If they succeed then I think it will change the standard advice that lawyers will give their clients about political contributions and also change common practices on Capitol Hill . " Stanley Brand , a noted criminal defense attorney at the Brand Law Group in Washington , agrees . " The department is inching toward making campaign contributions the central thing of value when they charge a bribe , " says Brand . " I do n't know if they 'll get all the way there . But it would be an " eight on the Richter scale for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest group would have to ask itself if its donation is going to be grist for a prosecution . " <p> The earthquake would certainly upset Washington , but it would probably delight almost everyone else . For decades , opinion polls have shown that voters think their politicians are bought and sold by the rich and connected . But these same voters have also seen any number of campaign finance " reforms " put in place , only to watch the system become evermore driven by dollars . <p> Unlike overhaul efforts in the past , though , which have relied on politicians cleaning up the very system that keeps them in power , the Justice Department 's Abramoff case opens up the possibility of genuine change . Imagine , for instance , if the oil companies and their executives could no longer link their campaign contributions to their interests in energy legislation . Or if trial lawyers could n't do the same with tort reform legislation . Robbed of much of their ability to bend the power structure with donations and other gifts , these industries would have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead to rely on the persuasiveness of their arguments rather than the power of their pocketbooks . Legalized bribery <p> Campaign finance laws are built on a legal fiction . To wit : Electoral donations are considered within the law even though they are actually bribes at root . Think of them as " legalized bribery . " Through bundled contributions and PAC giving , industries , labor unions , and interest groups of all stripes try to persuade lawmakers to vote their way on the issues they care most about . Donors do not express their desire just that way . They use euphemisms like " buying access " to wink and nod their way toward the same thought . But the truth is the truth . Interests give money to buy votes . Unfortunately for those interests , lawmakers receive funds from so many sources , and also sometimes make their legislative decisions based on factors that have nothing to do with money , that the contributions do not always produce the result they desire . Still , the basic fact remains . The dollars would not be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific result . <p> At the same time , congressional campaigns must be privately funded . Candidates for elective office have no choice but to raise the money they need to pay for advertising , consultants and the like . And that , in turn , has forced the legal system to attempt the impossible : to clear the way for financial gifts while also trying to limit the influence those gifts inevitably bestow on the recipients . The result has been an elaborate set of monetary limits and disclosure requirements that superficially transform outcome-directed gratuities into federally sanctioned benefits . <p> The compromise has never worked very well . Numerous campaign finance overhauls enacted since Watergate , up to and including the 2002 McCain-Feingold bill , have driven out many of the grossest abuses  --  for instance , lawmakers blithely accepting envelopes of money in exchange for favors . And disclosure requirements have at least given citizens the ability to see who 's trying to purchase influence from whom . But by providing the imprimatur of respectability to campaign contributions , the so-called reforms also helped increase the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of invulnerability . <p> The laws certainly did n't stop former Rep. Tony Coelho , head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 1980s , from openly demanding that GOP-leaning lobbyists share their largesse with the reigning Democrats as the price of having their concerns considered . Nor did they hinder Abramoff , DeLay , and others from melding K Street and the GOP into a modern-day political machine . By placing loyalists in key K Street jobs , and cutting out Democrats when they could , GOP leaders gave themselves the ability to divert rivers of donations ( from , say , Indian tribes or drug companies ) to whichever close House race or subterranean independent expenditure they wished . And they 've attempted to punish lobbying organizations that would n't cooperate . DeLay was even warned about the practice by the House ethics committee in 1999 after he and others tried to prevent an electronics association from hiring a Democrat as its president . " That was incredibly objectionable and , I thought , illegal ; legislation was so clearly tied to finances . And DeLay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of Repubhcan contributors in his desk , " said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) . " Now , it seems the Justice Department is coming around to thinking that it is illegal , and that is an excellent thing . " When is a bribe not a bribe ? <p> Whether they knew it or not , donors have always been under threat of bribery charges if they overtly tried to buy a lawmaker 's vote with their campaign contributions  --  and the lawmaker acquiesced in the deal . But both donors and politicians have been largely shielded from the consequences of their actions in part because bribery cases involving campaign contributions are hard to prove in court . <p> Still , such cases are winnable if prosecutors are willing to put in the time . Former South Carolina state representative Paul Derrick was convicted in 1999 on extortion and conspiracy charges related to taking a fully disclosed , $1,000 campaign contribution in exchange for his vote on a gambhng bill . Authorities conducted a sting operation ( called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly connected the technically legal donation to the vote . <p> " If somebody follows the legislature 's rules to the letter but it 's then proven that they took something including a campaign donation in exchange for some official act , they nonetheless would be violating criminal law , " says Jan Baran , an expert on campaign-finance law with Wiley Rein &; Fielding . Kathleen Clark , a professor at Washington University Law School in St. Louis agrees : " The court has put obstacles in the way of prosecutions of special interest campaign contributions , but has never made them impossible . " <p> All contributions , of course , are not bribes . A politician who runs on an anti-abortion platform , takes contributions from anti-abortion supporters , and subsequently votes in line with those views , would never be subject to the bribery statute . " There 's a large segment of fundraising activity that is perfectly legal and appropriate , " notes Baran . " Candidates will always get money in legal amounts from people who support them . That 's not evidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The shorthand way of expressing when a legal contribution can be a bribe is this : When a person gives anything of value , including a nominally legal campaign contribution , to a public official in exchange for what 's known in the trade as an " official act , " that is a bribe . Sun-Diamond Growers of California was convicted during the Clinton administration of giving illegal gratuities to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy , including tennis tickets , luggage and other gifts worth about $5,900 . But the Supreme Court let the agricultural cooperative off the hook in 1999 when it wrote , " For bribery there must be a quid pro quo  --  a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act . " Espy had gotten plenty from Sun-Diamond , but had done nothing in return for the gifts . Therefore , no crime was committed . <p> Sounds simple , right ? Well , it is n't . UCLA law professor Daniel H. Lowenstein wrote an entire chapter in a 2004 scholarly book , Private and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campaign Contribution a Bribe ? " His answer to the question he posed was , essentially , " Well , it 's hard to know . " The law on the subject , he wrote , is " unstable , " " cloudy , " and " hopelessly confused . " What about the instance , he asked , in which a lawmaker promises to support a major donor " whenever I can " ? Is that illegal ? Or how about when a lawmaker changes his position on an issue right after a big contribution is given by a company that wants him to vote that way ? Can that possibly be okay ? <p> Experience tells us that lawmakers and lobbyists almost never say directly what they mean when it comes to what an average person would consider to be graft . Neither side of such a transaction is generally dumb enough to speak the following sentence for example : " Okay , here 's the deal , for $100,000 , the vote will go the way we agree . " ( The now-incarcerated former representative Randy " Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S50,000 for every $1 million in appropriated funds he would obtain  --  on congressional stationery no less . But he is the exception . ) If a lawmaker accepts money to vote in favor of a briber 's interest , that is ahnost certainly a crime . But beyond that , the issue is not clear-cut . " It 's very difficult to make campaign contributions into a bribe , especially in the absence of undisputable video or audio recordings , " says Baran . <p> In addition to the difficulty of gathering sufficient incriminating evidence of an explicit quid pro quo , prosecutors must also contend with recent court rulings that have narrowed the definition of what constitutes an " official act . " In a 2 to 1 decision by a federal appeals court panel in February , the illegal gratuities conviction of a former D.C. Metropolitan Police Department detective named Nelson Valdes was overturned because his actions were not a " formal " part of his job and , therefore , were not deemed to be an " official act . " Valdes ran license plate numbers through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected to a person who paid him cash . But the court ruled that since the collecting of such data represented a " casual and informal use of government resources " and was not part of his normal duties , his 2002 conviction had to be reversed . The ruling makes it that much harder to win bribery cases involving campaign contributions . " Now , virtually every time the government tries to bring an official-acts prosecution , " says Boston College law professor George Brown , " the defense will cite the Valdes case . " A new supply of red ink <p> Yet despite all the obstacles , federal prosecutors have gathered enough incriminating evidence of campaign donation bribery in the Abramoff affair to convince those involved ( and their high-priced lawyers ) to own up to their crimes rather than take their chances in court . The pleas stemming from the Abramoff scandal all involve campaign donations . According to Abramoff 's plea agreement , he , ex-DeLay aide Michael Scanlon , and others " engaged in a course of conduct through which one or both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public officials in exchange for a series of official acts .. These things of value included , but are not limited to , foreign and domestic travel , golf fees , frequent meals , entertainment , election support for candidates for government office , employment for relatives of officials , and campaign contributions . " The plea deal for Tony Rudy , also a former DeLay aide , lists " election support " among the things of value he gave with Abramoff and others . <p> The Abramoff and Scanlon pleas get very specific . The contributions that they swapped for favors included $4,000 to the campaign committee of " Representative #1 " and $10,000 in contributions to the National Republican Congressional Committee " at Representative #1 's request . " Representative #1 has been widely identified as Rep. Bob Ney ( R-Ohio ) , who is under investigation as part of the Abramoff scam . Ney denies any wrongdoing . Officials close to the investigations say that possible campaign-donation bribery is also being looked at as part of the ongoing probes of as many as six other lawmakers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-examination and relative self-denial . All sorts of accepted rules and behaviors are being reconsidered . Many lawmakers and congressional staffers are voluntarily staying away from the fancy dinners and lunches that lobbyists love to host , at least for the time being . And one of Capitol Hill 's sweetest and most widely available perks  --  travel to golf resorts underwritten by private pleaders  --  has become a rarely sampled treat . <p> But the most interesting signs of potentially big changes to come can be seen in the advice that beltway lawyers are giving to their clients . Ken Gross , head of the political law practice at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &; Flom , has been swamped this year with requests for information and analysis from big corporations and trade associations eager to know how to stay out of trouble in post-Abramoff Washington . Gross is wanting his big business clients to be extra careful about how they handle their millions of dollars in contributions to candidates for federal office . Tying those gifts even subtly to a request to take a specific action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver into legal jeopardy . Under this theory , for example , real-estate brokers would be prohibited from saying even tangentially that their donations are intended to protect the home-mortgage-interest deduction even though , of course , they are . <p> As a result , Gross and his team at Skadden are looking more minutely than ever at a wider variety of money-solicitation communications sent out by the political action committees they represent , and weeding out explicit language . Whenever the lawyers see wording that even suggests what the PACs want in return for their donations , they recommend that the offending text be removed . " I do n't say that any of these things are legally actionable , " Gross says . Yet he edits them out anyway . " I 've had to get a new supply of red ink , " he says . <p> These retrenchments are minuscule compared to the burgeoning reassessment of campaign giving , which is the biggest potential alteration that Abramoff could bring to town . If 2006 brings a slew of indictments against members of Congress and their aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box in November , almost anything can happen . Lawmakers could decide not to hold as many lobbyist-sponsored fundraising events , especially in Washington , for fear of bad publicity ( and possible indictment against themselves ) and raise much more of their money from small-dollar Internet-based sources and from their own constituents back home . So much of what denizens of the capital do revolves around raising money that if the Abramoff affair even slows campaign donations a little , Washington could be transformed a lot . <p> The Abramoff plea agreements are also sparking a reassessment among at least some public-interest groups about the best way to fight the " corrupting influence " of money in politics . For decades , such groups have poured their energies into trying to make the existing system of campaign-finance regulations and laws work better , to little avail . Now , groups like Melanie Sloan 's CREW are turning increasingly to the Justice Department rather than to Congress to find redress against abuses in the campaign-finance system . Instead of spending all its time filing complaints with congressional ethics committees ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CREW has also been writing letters to the Justice Department seeking investigations , for example , of Republican Reps . Pete Sessions ( Texas ) and Jerry Lewis ( Calif. ) for acting too closely in concert with their donors . It thinks it has a strong chance for success there given the Abramoff cases . " Although the Justice Department has always been entitled to look at campaign contributions as bribes , it has n't done so traditionally , " Sloan said . " But now the department is making a change . " <p> Groups for or against abortion do n't just work to elect lawmakers who support their positions . They also bring lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of , say , South Dakota 's ban on abortion or California 's stem-cell agency . With these suits , they hope not only to win specific battles but also to get judgments that set new legal precedents . Similarly , if groups devoted to reining in Washington 's money culture really wanted to make headway , perhaps they would be wise to focus not only on pushing elected officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might put lawmakers and their donors in jail and perhaps would force the courts to clarify their cloudy definitions of bribery . Money will always have a say in politics . But nowadays , its voice is deafening . Maybe the work of diligent prosecutors will soon allow average voters to be heard more often as well . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Inside the Monocle , a popular restaurant for Washington fundraisers .
