Introduction // " How did you do that ? " // " Sorry ? " // " How did you do that ? " // The scientist was looking at me with a puzzled expression . We were not in any laboratory , nor was he asking me about any of my memory , linguistic , or numerical skills . We were standing on a lawn outside the research center where I had come earlier in the day for a variety of cognitive tests . Next to him was my mother , who had accompanied me on the trip from London . We were in the process of having our photo taken together , when after a few moments in front of the camera I relaxed and started to step away . How , the scientist wanted to know , had I been able to perceive the photo being taken when , standing right next to me , he had not heard a click or seen any flash . Was my brain really that extraordinary ? // Well , yes , but not for the reasons that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise when the photo was taken , it had produced a pinprick of blurry red light . My autistic mind  --  wired in such a way that I am able to spot tiny details that most other people often miss  --  had perceived it effortlessly . After I explained this to the scientist , he asked for another photo to be taken . By looking carefully where I told him I had seen the red dot of light appear , he was able to see it , too . // For the record , I will confirm that I have no telepathic relationship with cameras , nor any extrasensory perception for knowing when a photo has or has not been taken . Rather , what I had done that day was simply an extreme form of an everyday act : to see . We rely heavily on our eyes to provide much of the information we obtain about the world around us , and it is for this reason that a significant portion of the human brain is devoted entirely to visual processing . // The scientist who thought I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown power had arrived at a wrong but surprisingly common conclusion : that individuals with very different minds must use them in some fundamentally different , almost magical way . As one of the world 's few wellknown autistic savants , I have received all manner of strange requests : from being asked to predict the following week 's winning lottery numbers , to requests for advice on building a perpetual motion machine . Little wonder then that conditions such as autism and savant syndrome remain poorly understood by most people , including many experts . // It is not only savant minds that are considered somehow supernaturally gifted and therefore set apart from those of most other people : the success of outstanding individuals in numerous fields , from Mozart and Einstein to Garry Kasparov and Bill Gates , has been attributed by many to minds they regard as unearthly and inexplicable . I think this view is not only erroneous but harmful , too , because it separates the achievements of talented individuals from their humanity ; an injustice both to them and to everyone else . // Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of studying the minds of highly gifted people , as well as those of housewives , cab drivers , and many others from all walks of life . As a result , today , we have a far richer , more sophisticated understanding of human ability and potential than ever before . Anyone with the passion and dedication necessary to master a field or subject can succeed in it . Genius , in all its forms , is not due to any mere quirk of the brain ; it is the result of far more chaotic , dynamic , and essentially human qualities such as perseverance , imagination , intuition , and even love . Such an understanding of the human mind enriches , rather than detracts from , the popular appreciation of the accomplishments of highly successful individuals . // This book is about the mind  --  its nature and abilities . It combines some of the latest neuroscientific research with my personal reflections and detailed descriptions of my abilities and experiences . My primary intention in writing it is to show that differently functioning minds such as mine ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , in fact , and that anyone can learn from them . Along the way , I hope to clear up many misconceptions about the nature of savant abilities and what it means to be intelligent or gifted . // Chapter 1 looks at the fascinating complexity of the human brain and surveys some of the latest research findings from the field of neuroscience . Here I tackle head on some of the most common misconceptions concerning the brain , such as the idea that it does not change after birth or that the computer is a good analogy for how our brains work . I also assess several claims about savants and give evidence that indicates that savant brains are not so different from anyone else's. // Chapter 2 is a study of intelligence that questions whether IQ is an accurate indicator of intelligent behavior and looks at alternative ways of thinking about intelligence . I also examine the nature of genius and whether it is the result of innate talent , practice , or both . // Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 include detailed descriptions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense respectively  --  areas where my autism helps me to excel . These chapters represent the most comprehensive personal account of savant ability ever written . Rather than encourage readers to merely gawk at the abilities of savants such as myself , I show that anyone can learn from them how to better understand and use his own mind . // Drawing again from my own personal experiences ( as well as those of other autistic individuals ) , chapter 6 explores creativity and the possibility that some neurological conditions predispose individuals to extraordinary forms of creative thought and perception . I describe little-known forms of creativity , such as the phenomenon of languages created spontaneously by some children , and refute the myth that autistic savants are incapable of genuine creativity , using examples from my own and others ' work . // In chapter 7 , I examine what the latest scientific research tells us about the complexity and limitations of our perceptions . I also explore how biological differences can cause different people to see the world in very different ways . Sections on the puzzle of optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjectivity of our minds ' eyes . // In chapter 8 , I look at the nature of information and its relationship with our minds in the internet age of Wikipedia , twenty-four-hour rolling news broadcasts , and the ubiquity of modern advertising . I explore the role of words in shaping how we perceive and think about something , and how we share knowledge through such means as gossip and urban myths . I also give suggestions on how we can learn to navigate our information-dense world and reduce our risk of information overload . // In chapter 9 , I demonstrate and explain the benefits of and methods for thinking mathematically . I show how ordinary intuitions can often lead to wrong conclusions , and how a lack of understanding of probability can result in bad choices . I also analyze complex real-world entities , such as lotteries and voting systems , from a mathematical perspective and show how certain statistical arguments for popular claims do not add up . A final section helps you learn how to use numbers and logic to think more carefully and successfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human mind , from the remarkable medical and technological breakthroughs that are transforming the treatment of injured and diseased brains , to the new insights of cognitive researchers that suggest our minds extend far beyond the confines of the head . I also assess the claims of futurists who assert that , inevitably , mind and machine will merge and give rise to a new " cyborg " species . I finish with some personal reflections on what I hope the future will bring for every kind of mind . // A final note : The title of this book was inspired by one of my favorite poems , a meditation on the mind by the celebrated nineteenth-century American poet Emily Dickinson . Every schoolchild should learn these verses : // The brain is wider than the sky , For , put them side by side , The one the other will containWith ease , and you beside . // The brain is deeper than the sea , For , hold them , blue to blue , The one the other will absorb , As sponges , buckets do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , For , heft them , pound for pound , And they will differ , if they do , As syllable from sound . //
