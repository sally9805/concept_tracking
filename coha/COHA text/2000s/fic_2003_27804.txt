Nighttime , summer Philadelphia Damali Richards could still feel the electricity of the crowd and the adrenaline rush of her spoken-word performance pulsing through her veins as she entered the backstage dressing room . The club was jumping so hard it seemed like even the walls were sweating . The bass thumping from the extensive speaker system was like an insistent heartbeat that she could feel vibrating through the floor and smoke-thickened air until it entered her body through the soles of her feet . Dirty aqua-colored paint peeled at the corners of the cramped space , as though it was trying to escape the throbbing scene . She glanced around at the ugly , stained brown sofa , and the sparse collection of wooden and metal chairs , immediately opting to stand rather than flop on any of the seating choices . How many performers ' body funk had been permanently tattooed on that sorry excuse for a couch , she wondered ? Even the one mirror in the room was covered with a white , filmy layer of grime . Yuck . And people thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-man squad crammed into a dump . Pullease . Sweat , icy yet burning , made her clothes stick to her skin . Her heavily beaded , Nzinga queen warrior headdress had suddenly become an intolerable weight on her damp scalp . Damali roughly removed it , tossing it onto a chair , and she held her shoulder-length locks up off her neck to give her overheated body a much-needed waft of air . The semiprecious stone and lion 's teeth adornments , affixed to her locks with silver and copper wire , gently clinked as she moved her hair . She grimaced at the sound that was now too close to her skull . All five feet seven inches of her felt on fire . Being an artist was great , but this was no way to live . " Lot of activity on radar tonight , " Marlene said in a near whisper , as though talking to herself . " Most times we get a visit from one or two vampires . I 'm sensing many . " " Yeah , " Damali croaked . Her vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her response short . Besides , what else was there to say to her manager , who was like a surrogate mother to their group ? Damali and Marlene shared a glance . They both knew what had to be done . Things were heating up . Before , one vamp might follow them , at most two . But ever since they 'd turned the tables and went on the offensive a couple of times , seeking out the action instead of waiting for it to come to them , nothing had been the same . The rare random ambushes were now becoming a regular phenomenon . Valuable junior team members had been lost because if it . Irritation coiled within Damali . She 'd told Marlene this shit would go down like that once they started hunting . Shoulda let sleeping dogs lie . Marlene shot her a look that said do n't start . Screw Marlene and her pious yang . Not tonight . Sure , she loved Mar like a mom and all , but was n't feeling sister-girl right now . Yeah , they only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the point . " You did n't hear me , did you ? " Damali cut Marlene a hard glance , then looked away . " No . What did you say ? " Marlene waited until the two women 's eyes met again . " I did n't say anything . I thought it , and you did n't hear me in your head . But I 'm able to read you loud and clear . That concerns me . " Total annoyance wrapped itself around Damali and she gave Marlene another glare to make her back off . She felt invaded . " I 'm just tired , that 's all . The past is the past . It 's done now , anyway . Drop it . " " You need to tell us when you 're having sensory blackouts . They 're becoming more frequent , are n't they ? You could have sent that to me without a word . " The other members of the team gave Damali a quick look of concern , but were wise enough not to get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd let the bullshit pass , because she and Marlene were always at it . Whatever . Instead of answering Marlene , Damali forced her attention toward the Native American flutes , cowbells , and chimes that rested against large conga drums in the corner of the room . Her gaze scanned the sharp , titanium-based , silver-plated anchors that held the drumhead skins in place . She refused to answer Marlene 's question . She did n't feel like dealing with that crap right now . There was something making the hair stand up on the back of her neck . Tonight , the drum anchors were going in her belt , even if that music gear was Jose 's , a.k.a . Wizard . He was da bomb in concert , but he did n't know how to use the disguised weapons as well as she did out in the streets . Summoning inner strength , Damali blocked Marlene 's intrusion into her thoughts . She 'd give Marlene a mental blank to consider while taking her time to figure out how to better arm herself . The crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , and all were simply packing gear . That was not her team 's normal behavior after a gig . The walls of the tiny room felt like they were closing in on her , swallowing her crew whole . Damali studied her weapons options . Maybe a few silver-plated chimes would be a safe bet , too ? Jose could do his thing on crossbow , his favorite weapon anyway . A sister could back somethin ' up off her with the dagger-edges off the drum anchors and chimes , if it got crazy out there-same deal with the cymbals . Even though she reminded herself that when a cymbal disc was thrown dead-aim the edge was sharp enough to slice paper without hearing it rip , that fact did n't make her feel better tonight . Why not ? Her gaze instantly went to the Fender-Jake Rider 's electric guitar , and to Shabazz 's bass , and then to Marlene 's electric violin . Marlene 's line of vision followed Damali 's for a moment before Marlene began assisting the others with equipment breakdown . As Marlene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up Damali 's spine . Yeah , they 'd better restring the instruments and put in the steel cables across the reinforced metal bridges . Tonight felt like a crossbow-necessary night , and the string instruments were easier to roll with . She might even get Wizard to hook up the light poles through the phony strap loops to lock and load additional crossbows . But Marlene needed to give up the walking stick as her only protection . Sistah better recognize , and deal with her violin like it had been designed-put the steel-based bow across the bridge and be ready to rock . It felt like they 'd need the light cannons out there , too , although at the moment , she could n't exactly say why . Nah ... this was no way to live . She walked over to the drums and ignored the look Marlene cast in her direction . The dense scent of frankincense , sage , and myrrh had trailed into the room behind her from the stage . Damali licked her parched lips , tasting salt on them , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retch . Usually the aroma calmed her , its elements anointing her stage space-a required opening before a purple haze of dry-ice smoke was released as she 'd enter a performance and claim it . The ring of holy water which had been poured around her in libation to bring forth the ancestors to channel-speak through her , and to encircle her while she spat out the truth of injustice , did not infuse her marrow with unshakable confidence tonight . Heavy bass still throbbed in her skull , now cranking the growing headache to a new decibel level with the ongoing club music that quaked the walls . Being a vampire huntress was no way to live . " You all right ? " Marlene 's question hung in the air as the other crew members paused in their tasks for a moment , considered her , and glanced at each other as though waiting for the green light to continue their equipment breakdown . Damali just nodded . The crew resumed motion , but kept glancing at her from the corners of their eyes . She wanted to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook weapons . The equipment they took on the road was disguised enough to get through new airport security screenings , which meant it was n't the real heavy artillery . And , yeah , it would be enough to stop a few predators . But if her senses were right , they were in for sho ' nuff action tonight . The problem was , she could n't half see . Her normal sight was fine , but inside her head , everything was blurry . Her third-eye was down . Had been that way for a couple of weeks , like static on a television . Intermittent static . Sometimes her mental radar was crystal clear , but at other times , like tonight , it was all snow . She hated this bull . " We need to hurry up , " Damali said out of the blue . Her crew stared at her . One by one they nodded , but nobody said a word . Damn , it was hot in there . For some reason , the air-conditioned confines did n't cool her off either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were suffocating her , while the ropes of semiprecious amulets and stones set in thick silver around her wrists , and especially about her neck , began feeling like a humid noose . She began stripping them off , ignoring Marlene 's expression of disapproval . The necklaces were practically strangling her . She 'd have to chance having her throat exposed , just so she could breathe . Unable to bear the weight of it , Damali cast off her wide silver belt , and the clatter of it against a nearby coffee table almost made her cringe from the piercing sound of metal connecting with the wood . The ankh earrings of amber and silver and onyx had to come off-they were all too heavy , no matter what Marlene said about the protective talismans that hung as guards to her jugular . Everything felt like it was holding on to her , grasping at her . She could n't breathe ! " You 're sure you 're all right ? " Marlene had stopped working over an equipment bag to hold her in a steady gaze . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , " Damali finally muttered . There was no need to bring her foul vibe to the group . It was n't their fault . Why alarm them if this was only a case of raw nerves ? She studied the drum anchors one last time and then walked away from them . " Guess I 'm just tired from giving it a hundred and fifty percent tonight . " The others in the room simply stared at her , their silence filling in the gaps with quiet apprehension . Yeah , they all felt it , she could tell . Oh , well , shit happens . They knew that , too . None of them wanted to do this destiny thing , especially her . They were trapped as guardians , just like she was trapped as a vampire huntress . There was only one choice that they 'd all learned the hard way-band together or die , or worse . " Let 's just keep moving , people . Anybody seen my Tims ? " Marlene extracted the flat-heeled , amber-colored suede boots Damali had requested from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damali caught each shoe and bent to put them on . Slowly , her crew resumed their packing . The sleek high-heeled boots she 'd worn during the performance had become like anvils on her legs . This was not a high-heel , be fly and cute kinda night . This was a possible kick ass after a show deal . Despite the sheerness of the color-splashed , tie-dyed duster and embroidered midriff brassiere she performed in , they too felt like they were cutting off her blood flow , and made her want to scream . Her breasts , which she had always believed to be too small , now felt oddly pendulous , heavy , too constricted by her costume . The fragile silver waist-chain she donned seemed to push bile up from her gullet and into her throat . If she were n't almost twenty-one years old , and in top athletic form , she would have sworn that she was having a mild heart attack . Damali peered in the mirror , appraising her once-bronze complexion that now seemed pallid-but was eerily relieved to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell was wrong with her ? " Somebody throw me a T-shirt . " Shabazz complied , and flung a shirt with the band 's logo on it in her direction . " Thanks . " Damali gave her crew her back and stripped off the offending sheer top of her stage costume . The guys averted their eyes , as was normal , and as soon as she pulled on the cotton , she sighed . " That 's much better . Now I 'm good . " " You put a lot of energy into the show , " Marlene said after a long pause while the group resumed breakdown . But she spoke in a calm voice , one almost too calm . " Got a reputation to maintain , Mar . " Damali made eye contact with Marlene and held her with a brief stare . Read the double meaning in that , sis . Do n't front on me-not with my crew standing around . Address it later . Marlene nodded but said nothing . Cool . Damali relaxed a bit . Oh , yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now wondered what Marlene , their seer-guardian , had sensed . When Marlene had visions , she got real cool-scary calm . Damali tossed her knowledge of Marlene 's capabilities around inside her head and watched her mentor 's body language . Only having a portion of one 's skills to rely on was a bitch . Maybe she should have just told Mar that she was going blind again tonight . But she hated the concept . What , and have the guys go back to treating her like a young buck ? A newbie ? Hell , no . This was her crew , and whatever was going wrong with her was temporary . All she had to do was look at Marlene hard to know it was gon na be on when they left , no doubt . Did n't need second sight to pick that up . Jose glanced from crew member to crew member , his nerves also seeming raw . The fact that no one else had said a word had to be jacking with him . Their percussion man 's dark eyes shifted nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it to ' em , D , " he confirmed after a hesitant glance up from his task of packing away equipment . Small talk , a sure sign of nerves . She hated small talk . " Thanks , Wizard . " " You owned New Energy tonight . The club will never be the same-Warriors of Light Productions and you , lady , should get some good ink from this one in the press tomorrow . " Tomorrow ? Assuming they made it through the night . Damali glanced at Jose and then toward Marlene . That crazy Mexican Indian always started babbling when he was hyped . She loved him just the same , but if their ace tracker was trippin ' - then damn . Marlene blanched . Obviously Marlene got that message , too . " Sho ' nuff , we brought it , Wizard , " Damali said in a short pant , giving Jose a fist pound , trying to make him feel better as she did so . It was obvious that her mental wall against Marlene was n't even working . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forget that , Wizard always talked a lot and his voice got louder when nervous . Tonight was no different . It made her head hurt . She glanced at Marlene again . Continues ...
