Inside the Google Empire <P> Our search into the inner workings of the Internet-service giant Google turned up enthusiasm for the brilliance behind its simplicity and success and for its " do n't be evil " mantra . But disillusion has already struck for those who think Google trashed that tenet by censoring its way into China 's cyberspace <P> I very much enjoyed your article on the Google empire Feb. 20 . But did TIME 's reporters walk out of the Googleplex , the company 's headquarters in Mountain View , Calif. , really understanding why Google is so successful ? Google 's triumph lies in its enormous user base . Growing that base to infinity plus one is far more important than ad revenues . Once you have the most wanted product in the universe , you have a googol ( 1 followed by 100 zeros ) possible ways to make money . <P> JOHN SKELLY Mons , France <P> Despite Google 's refusal to turn over data on people 's Internet use to U.S. prosecutors , the company is actually betraying its customers ' trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If phone companies logged the content of everybody 's phone calls , consumers would be outraged . Perhaps Google 's respecting the privacy of its customers is not congruent with the goal of Internet domination . <P> ED R. BAUMAN Santa Monica , Calif . <P> I trust Google to protect my privacy a whole lot more than I do the occupant of the White House and the corporate chieftains he takes his orders from . <P> CHRIS GODWIN Delaware City , Del . <P> Google is young , small and agile enough to create a unique culture of Web-use creativity that feeds its bottom line . I was impressed to learn that each Google employee is supposed to devote 10% of his or her time to exploring far-out ideas . I also like the company 's emphasis on developing technology first and finding an economically viable business model second . Google could apply those values by entering the spam wars . If it develops an antispam tool that defeats e-mail evildoers , Google will continue growing while furthering its philosophy . <P> KEVIN A. KEANE Lafayette , N.J. <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google value profits over providing the best service to Chinese consumers ? In China , Google 's real customer is the government , not the people . Google should make full disclosure to the Chinese people of its compromised goods . <P> HOMER E. MYERS Vancouver , Wash . <P> It hardly matters that when people in China Google Tiananmen , the results do not include photos of rows of tanks . Google 's different versions reflect the thinking of different people . In China , people prefer to look forward . But in the West , people like to look back . The Western media are full of stories about massacres , genocide and dictatorships in remote countries that most Western readers are barely aware of . China 's Tiananmen Square is such a great place , the entrance to the magnificent Forbidden City . Why do Westerners prefer to see the tanks on the street ? <P> FENG WANG Brussels <P> Calling for Cooler Heads
