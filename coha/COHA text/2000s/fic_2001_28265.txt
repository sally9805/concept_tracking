WHEN THE STURZO TWINS , Franky and Stace , pulled into Heskow 's driveway , they saw four very tall teenagers playing basketball on the small house court . Franky and Stace got out of their big Buick , and John Heskow came out to meet them . He was a tall , pear-shaped man ; his thin hair neatly ringed the bare top of his skull , and his small blue eyes twinkled . " Great timing , " he said . " There 's someone I want you to meet . " The basketball game halted . Heskow said proudly , " This is my son , Jocko . " The tallest of the teenagers stuck out his huge hand to Franky . " Hey , " Franky said . " How about giving us a little game ? " Jocko looked at the two visitors . They were about six feet tall and seemed in good shape . They both wore Ralph Lauren polo shirts , one red and the other green , with khaki trousers and rubber-soled shoes . They were amiable-looking , handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were obviously brothers , but Jocko could not know they were twins . He figured them to be in their early forties . " Sure , " Jocko said , with boyish good nature . Stace grinned . " Great ! We just drove three thousand miles and have to loosen up . " Jocko motioned to his companions , all well over six feet , and said , " I 'll take them on my side against you three . " Since he was the much better player , he thought this would give his father 's friends a chance . " Take it easy on them , " John Heskow said to the kids . " They 're just old guys futzing around . " It was midafternoon in December , and the air was chilly enough to spur the blood . The cold Long Island sunlight , pale yellow , glinted off the glass roofs and walls of Heskow 's flower sheds , his front business . " A million bucks , " Stace said . " That 's a lot of money . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Aprile , " Heskow said . " He wants the best help . Cool shooters and silent partners with mature heads . And you guys are simply the best . " Franky said , " And there are not many guys who would take the risk . " " Yeah , " Stace said . " You have to live with it the rest of your life . Somebody coming after you , plus the cops , and the feds . " " I swear to you , " Heskow said , " the NYPD wo n't go all out . The FBI will not take a hand . " " And the Don 's old friends ? " Stace asked . " The dead have no friends . " Heskow paused for a moment . " When the Don retired , he cut all ties . There 's nothing to worry about . " Franky said to Stace , " Is n't it funny , in all our deals , they always tell us there 's nothing to worry about ? " Stace laughed . " That 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old friend . We trust you . But what if you 're wrong ? Anybody can be wrong . What if the Don still has old friends ? You know how he operates . No mercy . We get nailed , we do n't just get killed . We 'll spend a couple of hours in hell first . Plus our families are at stake under the Don 's rule . That means your son . Ca n't play for the NBA in his grave . Maybe we should know who 's paying for this . " Heskow leaned toward them , his light skin a scarlet red as if he were blushing . " I ca n't tell you that . You know that . I 'm just the broker . And I 've thought of all that other shit . You think I 'm fucking stupid ? Who does n't know who the Don is ? But he 's defenseless . I have assurances of that from the top levels . The police will just go through the motions . The FBI ca n't afford to investigate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's foolproof . " " I never dreamed that Don Aprile would be one of my marks , " Franky said . The deed appealed to his ego . To kill a man so dreaded and respected in his world . " Franky , this is not a basketball game , " Stace warned . " If we lose , we do n't shake hands and walk off the court . " " Stace , its a million bucks , " Franky said . " And John never steered us wrong . Let 's go with it . " Stace felt their excitement building . What the hell . He and Franky could take care of themselves . After all , there was the million bucks . If the truth were told , Stace was more mercenary than Franky , more business-oriented , and the million swung him . " OK , " Stace said , " we 're in . But God have mercy on our souls if you 're wrong . " He had once been an altar boy " What about the Don being watched by the FBIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that ? " " No , " Heskow said . " When all his old friends went to jail , the Don retired like a gentleman . The FBI appreciated that . They leave him alone . I guarantee it . Now let me lay it out . " It took him a half hour to explain the plan in detail . Finally Stace said , " When ? " " Sunday morning , " Heskow said . " You stay here for the first two days . Afterward the private jet flies you out of Newark . " " We have to have a very good driver , " Stace said . " Exceptional . " " I 'm driving , " Heskow said , then added , almost apologetically , " It 's a very big payday . " For the rest of the weekend , Heskow baby-sat for the Sturzo brothers , cooking their meals , running their errands . He was not a man easily impressed , but the Sturzos sometimes sent a chill to his heart . They were like adders , their heads constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to the flowers in his sheds . The brothers played basketball one-on-one just before supper , and Heskow watched fascinated by how their bodies slithered around each other like snakes . Franky was faster and a deadly shooter . Stace was not as good but more clever . Franky could have made it to the NBA , Heskow thought . But this was not a basketball game . In a real crisis , it would have to be Stace . Stace would be the primary shooter . Chapter 2 THE GREAT 19gos FBI blitz of the Mafia families in New York left only two survivors . Don Raymonde Aprile , the greatest and most feared , remained untouched . The other , Don Timmona Portella , who was nearly his equal in power but a far inferior man , escaped by what seemed to be pure luck . But the future was clear . With the 1970 RICO laws so undemocratically framed , the zeal of special FBI prosecuting teams , and the death of the belief in omerta among the soldiers of the American Mafia , Don Raymonde Aprile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . The Don had ruled his Family for thirty years and was now a legend . Brought up in Sicily , he had none of the false ideas or strutting arrogance of the American-born Mafia chiefs . He was , in fact , a throwback to the old Sicilians of the nineteenth century who ruled towns and villages with their personal charisma , their sense of honor , and their deadly and final judgment of any suspected enemy . He also proved to have the strategic genius of those old heroes . Now , at sixty-two , he had his life in order . He had disposed of his enemies and accomplished his duties as a friend and a father . He could enjoy old age with a clear conscience , retire from the disharmonies of his world , and move into the more fitting role of gentleman banker and pillar of society His three children were safely ensconced in successful and honorable careers . His oldest son , Valerius , was now thirtyseven , married with children , and a colonel in the United States Army and lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his timidity as a child ; the Don had secured a cadet appointment at West Point to rectify this defect in his character . His second son , Marcantonio , at the early age of thirty-five , was , out of some mystery in the variation of his genes , a top executive at a national TV network . As a boy he had been moody and lived in a make-believe world and the Don thought he would be a failure in any serious enterprise . But now his name was often in the papers as some sort of creative visionary , which pleased the Don but did not convince him . After all , he was the boy 's father . Who knew him better ? His daughter , Nicole , had been affectionately called Nikki as a young child but at the age of six demanded imperiously that she be called by her proper name . She was his favorite sparring partner . At the age of twenty-nine , she was a corporate lawyer , a feminist , and a pro bono advocate of those poor and desperate criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was especially good at saving murderers from the electric chair , husband killers from prison confinement , and repeat rapists from being given life terms . She was absolutely opposed to the death penalty , believed in the rehabilitation of any criminal , and was a severe critic of the economic structure of the United States . She believed a country as rich as America should not be so indifferent to the poor , no matter what their faults . Despite all this she was a very skilled and tough negotiator in corporate law , a striking and forceful woman . The Don agreed with her on nothing . As for Astorre , he was part of the family , and closest to the Don as a titular nephew . But he seemed like a brother to the others because of his intense vitality and charm . From the age of three to sixteen he had been their intimate , the beloved youngest sibling-until his exile to Sicily eleven years before . The Don had summoned him back when he retired . The Don planned his retirement carefully . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to loyal friends , knowing that gratitude is the least lasting of virtues and that gifts must always be replenished . He was especially careful to pacify Timmona Portella . Portella was dangerous because of his eccentricity and a passionate murderousness that sometimes had no relationship to necessity . How Portella escaped the FBI blitz of the 19gos was a mystery to everyone . For he was an American-born don without subtlety , a man incautious and intemperate , with an explosive temper . He had a huge body with an enormous paunch and dressed like a Palermo picciotto , a young apprentice killer , all colors and silk . His power was based in the distribution of illegal drugs . He had never married and still at age fifty was a careless womanizer . He only showed true affection for his younger brother , Bruno , who seemed slightly retarded but shared his older brother 's brutality . Don Aprile had never trusted Portella and rarely did business with him . The man was dangerous through his weakness , a man to be neutralized . So now he summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , Bruno . Aprile met them with his usual quiet courtesy but came to the point quickly . " My dear Timmona , " he said . " I am retiring from all business affairs except my banks . Now you will be very much in the public eye and you must be careful . If you should ever need any advice , call on me . For I will not be completely without resources in my retirement . " Bruno , a small replica of his brother who was awed by the Don 's reputation , smiled with pleasure at this respect for his older brother . But Timmona understood the Don far better . He knew that he was being warned . He nodded respectfully to the Don . " You have always showed the best judgment of us all , " he said . " And I respect what you are doing . Count on me as your friend . " " Very good , very good , " the Don said . " Now , as a gift to you , I ask you to heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very devious . Do not trust him in any way . He is drunk with his success , and you will be his next target . " " But you and I have already escaped him , " Timmona said . " Though he brought all our friends down . I do n't fear him but I thank you . " They had a celebratory drink , and the Portella brothers left . In the car Bruno said , " What a great man . " " Yes , " Timmona said . " He was a great man . " As for the Don , he was well satisfied . He had seen the alarm in Timmona 's eyes and was assured there would no longer be any danger from him . Don Aprile requested a private meeting with Kurt Cilke , the head of the FBI in New York City Cilke , to the Don 's own surprise , was a man he admired . He had sent most of the East Coast Mafia chiefs to jail and almost broken their power . Don Raymonde Aprile had eluded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret informer , the one who made his success possible . But the Don admired Cilke even more because the man always played fair , had never tried frame-ups or powerplay harassments , had never given publicity pin marks on the Don 's children . So the Don felt it was only fair to warn him . The meeting was at the Don 's country estate in Montauk . Cilke would have to come alone , a violation of the Bureau rules . The FBI director himself had given approval but insisted Cilke use a special recording device . This was an implant in his body , below his rib cage , which would not show on the outer walls of his torso ; the device was not known to the public , and its manufacture was strictly controlled . Cilke realized that the real purpose of the wire was to record what he said to the Don . They met on a golden October afternoon on the Don 's verandah . Cilke had never been able to penetrate this house with a listening device , and a judge had barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way by the Don 's men , which surprised him . Obviously Don Raymond Aprile was not going to make him an illicit proposal . As always , Cilke was amazed and even a little disturbed by the impression that the Don made on him . Despite knowing that the man had ordered a hundred murders , broken countless laws of society , Cilke could not hate him . And yet he believed such men evil , hated them for how they destroyed the fabric of civilization . Don Aprile was clad in a dark suit , dark tie , and white shirt . His expression was grave and yet understanding , the lines in his face the gentle ones of a virtue-loving man . How could a such a humane face belong to someone so merciless , Cilke wondered . The Don did not offer to shake hands out of a sensibility not to embarrass Cilke . He gestured for his guest to be seated and bowed his head in greeting . " I have decided to place myself and my family under your protection-that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished . What the hell did the old man mean ? " For the last twenty years you have made yourself my enemy . You have pursued me . But I was always grateful for your sense of fair play . You never tried to plant evidence or encourage perjury against me . You have put most of my friends in prison , and you tried very hard to do the same to me . " Cilke smiled . " I 'm still trying , " he said . The Don nodded in appreciation . " I have rid myself of everything doubtful except a few banks , surely a respectable business . I have placed myself under the protection of your society . In return I will do my duty to that society . You can make it much easier if you do not pursue me . For there is no longer any need . " Cilke shrugged . " The Bureau decides . I 've been after you for so long , why stop now ? I might get lucky . " The Don 's face became graver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . Your enormous success of the past few years influenced my decision . But the thing is , I know your prize informant , I know who he is . And I have told no one . " Cilke hesitated for only seconds before he said impassively , " I have no such informant . And again , the Bureau decides , not me . So you 've wasted my time . " " No , no , " the Don said . " I 'm not seeking an advantage , just an accommodation . Allow me , because of my age , to tell you what I have learned . Do not exercise power because it is easy to your hand . And do not get carried away with a certainty of victory when your intellect tells you there is even a hint of tragedy . Let me say I regard you now as a friend , not an enemy , and think to yourself what you have to gain or lose by refusing this offer . " " And if you are truly retired , then of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . " You will have my goodwill , " the Don said . " That is worth something even from the smallest of men . " Later Cilke played the tape for Bill Boxton , his deputy , who asked , " What the hell was that all about ? " " That 's the stuff you have to learn , " Cilke told him . " He was telling me that he 's not completely defenseless , that he was keeping an eye on me . " " What bullshit , " Boxton said . " They ca n't touch a federal agent . " " That 's true , " Cilke said . " That 's why I kept after him , retired or not . Still , I 'm wary . We ca n't be absolutely sure . . . " Having studied the history of the most prestigious families in America , those robber barons who had ruthlessly built their fortunes while breaking the laws and ethics of human society , Don Aprile became , like them , a benefactor to all . Like them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's largest cities . So he gave generously to build a hospital for the poor . And he contributed to the arts . He established a chair at Columbia University for the study of the Renaissance . It was true that Yale and Harvard refused his twenty million dollars for a dormitory to be named for Christopher Columbus , who was at the time in disrepute in intellectual circles . Yale did offer to take the money and name the dorm after Sacco and Vanzetti , but the Don was not interested in Sacco and Vanzetti . He despised martyrs . A lesser man would have felt insulted and nursed a grievance , but not Raymonde Aprile . Instead , he simply gave the money to the Catholic Church for daily masses to be sung for his wife , now twenty-five years in Heaven . He donated a million dollars to the New York Police Benevolent Association and another million to a society for the protection of illegal immigrants . For the three years after his retirement , he showered his blessings on the world . His purse was open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pleas to contribute to the Campaign Against the Death Penalty-her crusade to stop capital punishment . It is astonishing how three years of good deeds and generosity can almost wipe out a thirty-year reputation of merciless acts . But great men also buy their own goodwill , forgiveness of betraying friends and exercising lethal judgment . And the Don too had this universal weakness . For Don Raymonde Aprile was a man who had lived by the strict rules of his own particular morality . His protocol had made him respected for over thirty years and generated the extraordinary fear that had been the base of his power . A chief tenet of that protocol was a complete lack of mercy . This sprang not from innate cruelty , some psychopathic desire to inflict pain , but from an absolute conviction : that men always refused to obey . Even Lucifer , the angel , had defied God and had been flung from the heavens . So an ambitious man struggling for power had no other recourse . Of course there were some persuasions , some concessions to another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that failed , there was only the punishment of death . Never threats of other forms of punishment that might inspire retaliation . Simply a banishment from this earthly sphere , no more to be reckoned with . Treachery was the greatest injury . The traitor 's family would suffer , as would his circle of friends ; his whole world would be destroyed . For there are many brave , proud men willing to gamble their lives for their own gain , but they would think twice about risking their loved ones . And so in this way Don Aprile generated a vast amount of terror . He relied on his generosity in worldly goods to win their less necessary love . But it must be said , he was as merciless to himself Possessed of enormous power , he could not prevent the death of his young wife after she had given him three children . She died a slow and horrible death from cancer as he watched over her for six months . During that time he came to believe that she was being punished for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that he decreed his own penance : He would never remarry . He would send his children away to be educated in the ways of lawful society , so they would not grow up in his world so full of hate and danger . He would help them find their way , but they would never be involved in his activities . With great sadness he resolved that he would never know the true essence of fatherhood . So the Don arranged to have Nicole , Valerius , and Marcantonio sent to private boarding schools . He never let them into his personal life . They came home for the holidays , when he played the role of a caring but distant father , but they never became part of his world . And yet despite everything and though they were aware of his reputation , his children loved him . They never talked about it among themselves . It was one of those family secrets that was not a secret . No one could call the Don sentimental . He had very few personal friends , no pets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Only once , many years before , he had committed an act of compassion that astounded his colleagues in America . Don Aprile , when he returned from Sicily with the infant , Astorre , found his beloved wife dying of cancer and his own three children desolate . Not wanting to keep the impressionable infant in such a circumstance for fear it would harm him in some way , the Don decided to place him in the care of one of his closest advisors , a man named Frank Viola , and his wife . This proved to be an unwise choice . At the time , Frank Viola had ambitions to succeed the Don . But shortly after the Don 's wife died , Astorre Viola , at the age of three , became a member of the Don 's personal family when his " father " committed suicide in the trunk of his car , a curious circumstance , and his mother died of a brain hemorrhage . It was then that the Don had taken Astorre into his household and assumed the title of uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents , Don Raymonde told him that he had been orphaned . But Astorre was a curious and tenacious young boy , so the Don , to put an end to all his questions , told him that his parents had been peasants , unable to feed him , and had died , unknown , in a small Sicilian village . The Don knew this explanation did n't completely satisfy the boy , and he felt a twinge of guilt over deceiving him , but he knew it was important while the child was still young to keep his Mafia roots a secret-for Astorre 's own safety and for the safety of the Aprile children . Don Raymonde was a farseeing man and knew that his success could not last forever-it was too treacherous a world . From the beginning he planned to switch sides , to join the safety of organized society . Not that he was truly conscious of his purpose , but great men have an instinct for what the future will demand . And in this case , truly , he acted out of compassion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have made no impression , could have given no hint of what he would later become as a man . Or how important a part he would play in the Family . The Don understood that the glory of America was the emergence of great families , and that the best social class sprang from men who had at first committed great crimes against that society . It was such men who in the search for fortune had also built America and left evil deeds to crumble into forgotten dust . How else could it be done ? Leave the Great Plains of America to those Indians who could not conceive of a three-story dwelling ? Leave California to Mexicans who had no technical ability , no vision of great aqueducts to feed water to lands that would allow millions to enjoy a prosperous life ? America had the genius to attract millions of laboring poor from all over the world , to entice them to the necessary hard work of building the railroads , the dams , and the sky-scratching buildings . Ah , the Statue of Liberty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turned out for the best ? Certainly there had been tragedies , but that was part of life . Was not America the greatest cornucopia the world had ever known ? Was not a measure of injustice a small price to pay ? It has always been the case that individuals must sacrifice to further the advance of civilization and his particular society . But there is another definition of a great man . Primarily that he does not accept that burden . In some way , criminal , immoral , or by sheer cunning , he will ride the crest of that wave of human progress without sacrifice . Don Raymonde Aprile was such a man . He generated his own individual power by his intelligence and by his complete lack of mercy He generated fear , he became a legend . But his children , when they were grown , never believed in the most atrocious stories . There was the legend of the beginning of his rule as Family chief . The Don controlled a construction company run by a subordinate , Tommy Liotti , whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building contracts . The man was handsome , witty , a thorough charmer , and the Don always enjoyed his company He had only one fault : He drank to excess . Tommy married the Don 's wife 's best friend , Liza , an oldfashioned handsome woman with a sharp tongue , who felt it her duty to curb her husband 's , obvious pleasure with himself . This led to some unfortunate incidents . He accepted her barbs well enough when he was sober , but when drunk he would slap her face hard enough to make her bite her tongue . It was also unfortunate that the husband had a massive strength due to working hard and long on construction sites during his youth . Indeed , he always wore short-sleeved shirts to display his magnificent forearms and his great biceps . Sadly , the incidents escalated over a period of two years . One night Tommy broke Liza 's nose and knocked out a few teeth , which required expensive surgical repair . The woman did not dare ask Don Aprile 's wife for protection , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she still loved her husband . It was not Don Aprile 's desire to interfere in the domestic squabbles of his underlings . Such things could never be solved . If the husband had killed the wife , he would not have been concerned . But the beatings posed a danger to his business relationship . An enraged wife could make certain testimonies , give damaging information . For the husband kept large quanti ties of cash in his house for those incidental bribes so necessary to the fulfillment of city contracts . So Don Aprile summoned the husband . With the utmost courtesy , he made it plain he interfered in the man 's personal life only because it affected business . He advised the man to kill his wife outright or divorce her or never to ill-treat her further . The husband assured him it would never happen again . But the Don was mistrustful . He had noticed that certain gleam in the man 's eyes , the gleam of free will . He considered this one of the great mysteries of life , that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cost . Great men have allied themselves with the angels at a terrible price to themselves . Evil men indulge their slightest whim for small satisfactions while accepting the fate of burning in hell . And so it turned out with Tommy Liotti . It took nearly a year , and Liza 's tongue grew sharper with her husband 's indulgence . Despite the warning from the Don , despite his love for his children and his wife , Tommy beat her in the most violent fashion . She ended up in the hospital with broken ribs and a punctured lung . With his wealth and political connections , Tommy bought one of the Don 's corrupt judges with an enormous bribe . Then he talked his wife into coming back to him . Don Aprile observed this with some anger and regretfully took charge of the affair . First , he attended to the practical aspects of the matter . He obtained a copy of the husband 's will and learned that like a good family man , he had left all his worldly goods to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he sent out a special team with specific instructions . Within the week the judge received a long box wrapped in ribbons , and in it , like a pair of expensive long silk gloves , were the two massive forearms of the husband , one wearing on its wrist the expensive Rolex watch the Don had given him years before as a token of his esteem . The next day the rest of the body was found floating in the water around the Verrazano Bridge . Another legend was chilling because of its ambiguity , like some childish ghost story . While the Don 's three children were attending boarding school , an enterprising and talented journalist noted for his witty exposure of the frailties of famous people tracked them down and enticed them into what seemed like harmless verbal exchange . The writer had great fun with their innocence , their preppy clothes , their juvenile idealism about how to make a better world . The journalist contrasted it with their father 's reputation while admitting that Don Aprile had never actually been convicted of a crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country even before publication . It was the kind of success a writer dreams about . Everybody loved it . The journalist was a nature lover , and every year he took his wife and two children to a cabin in upstate New York for hunting and fishing and living simply . They were there one long Thanksgiving weekend . On Saturday the cabin , ten miles from the nearest town , caught fire . There was no rescue for about two hours . By then the house had burned to smoking logs and the journalist and his family were merely charred and brittle sticks . There was an enormous outcry and a massive investigation , but no evidence of foul play could be found . The conclusion was that the family had been overcome by smoke before they could escape . Then a curious thing happened . A few months after the tragedy , whispers and rumors began to circulate . Anonymous tips came in to the FBI , the police , the press . They all suggested that the fire was an act of vengeance by the infamous Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamored for the case to be reopened . It was , but again there was no indictment . Yet , despite any proof , this became another legend of the Don 's ferocity . But that was the general public ; the authorities were satisfied , in this instance , that the Don was beyond reproach . Everybody knew journalists were exempt from any retaliation . You would have to kill thousands , so what was the point ? The Don was too intelligent to take such a risk . Still , the legend never died . Some FBI teams even thought the Don himself had inspired the rumors to fulfill his legend . And so it grew . But there was another side to the Don : his generosity . If you served him loyally , you became rich and had a formidable protector in times of travail . The rewards given by the Don were enormous but the punishments final . That was his legend . After his meetings with Portella and Cilke , Don Aprile had details to tidy up . He set in motion the machinery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He needed Astorre , indeed had prepared him for this moment . Astorre was the Don 's favorite , even above his own children . As a child Astorre was always a leader , precocious in his sociability . He loved the Don , and he did not fear him as his own children sometimes did . And though Valerius and Marcantonio were twenty and eighteen years old , when Astorre was ten , he established his independence from them . Indeed when Valerius , somewhat of a military martinet , tried to chastise him , he fought back . Marcantonio was much more affectionate to him and bought him his first banjo to encourage his singing . Astorre accepted this as the courtesy of one adult to another . The only one Astorre took orders from was Nicole . And though she was two years older , she treated him as a suitor , as he demanded even as a small boy . She made him run her errands and listened soulfully to the Italian ballads he sang her . And she slapped his face when he tried to kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was enraptured by feminine beauty . And Nicole was beautiful . She had large dark eyes and a sensual smile ; her face revealed every emotion she felt . She challenged anyone who tried to insinuate that as a female she was not as important as any man in her world . She hated the fact that she was not as physically strong as her brothers and Astorre , that she could not assert her will by force but only by her beauty . All this made her absolutely fearless , and she taunted them all , even her father , despite his dread reputation . After his wife 's death , when the children were still young , Don Aprile made it a practice to spend one summer month in Sicily He loved the life in his native village , near the town of Montelepre , and he still owned property there , a house that had been the country retreat of a count , called Villa Grazia . After a few years he hired a housekeeper , a Sicilian widow named Caterina . She was a very handsome woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of how to run a property and command respect from the villagers . She became his mistress . All of this he kept secret from his family and friends , though now he was a man of forty and a king in his world . Astorre Viola was only ten years old the first time he accompanied Don Raymonde Aprile to Sicily . The Don had been requested to mediate a great conflict between the Corleonisi cosca and the Clericuzio cosca . And it was also his pleasure to spend a quiet month of tranquillity at Villa Grazia . Astorre , at ten , was affable-there was no other word . He was always cheerful , and his handsome round face with its olive skin radiated love . He continually sang in a sweet tenor voice . And when he was not singing , he offered lively conversation . Yet he had the fiery qualities of a born rebel , and he terrorized the other boys his age . The Don brought him to Sicily because he was the best of company for a middle-aged man , which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how the Don had brought up his own three children . Once the Don settled his business affairs , he mediated the dispute and brought about temporary peace . Now he enjoyed his days reliving his childhood in his native village . He ate lemons , oranges , and olives from their briny barrels , and he took long walks with Astorre under the sullen deadly light of the Sicilian sun that reflected all the stone houses and countless rocks with a stunning heat . He told the small boy long-ago stories of the Robin Hoods of Sicily , their fights against the Moors , the French , the Spaniards , the pope himself . And tales of a local hero , the Great Don Zeno . At night , together on the terrace of the Villa Grazia , they watched the azure sky of Sicily lit with a thousand shooting stars and the flashes of lightning hurling through the mountains just a short distance away . Astorre picked up the Sicilian dialect immediately and ate the black olives from the barrel as if they were bits of candy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gang of young village boys . It was a wonder to the Don that he could do so , for Sicilian children were full of pride and feared no one . Many of these ten-year-old cherubs were already familiar with the 1upara , the ever-present Sicilian shotgun . Don Aprile , Astorre , and Caterina spent long summer nights eating and drinking al fresco in the luxuriant garden , the orange and lemon trees saturating the air with their citrus perfume . Sometimes old boyhood friends of the Don were invited to dinner and a game of cards . Astorre helped Caterina serve them drinks . Caterina and the Don never showed public signs of affection , but all was understood in the village , so no man dared to present any gallantries to Caterina and all showed her all the respect the female head of the house was due . No time in his life was more pleasant to the Don . It was just three days before the end of the visit that the unimaginable happened : The Don was kidnapped while walking the streets of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most remote and undeveloped in Sicily , the head of the village cosca , the local Mafioso , was a ferocious , fearless bandit by the name of Fissolini . Absolute in his local power , he really had no communication with the rest of the Mafia coscas on the island . He knew nothing of the Don Aprile 's enormous power , nor did he think it could penetrate his own remote and secure world . He decided to kidnap the Don and hold him for ransom . The only rule he knew he was breaking was that he was encroaching onto the territory of the neighboring cosca , but the American seemed a rich enough prize to warrant the risk . The cosca is the basic unit of what is called the Mafia and is usually composed of blood relatives . Law-abiding citizens such as lawyers or doctors attach themselves to a cosca for protection of their interests . Each cosca is an organization in and of itself but may ally itself to a stronger and more powerful one . It is this interlinking that is commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander . A cosca usually majors in a particular racket in its particular territory . There is the cosca that controls the price of water and prevents the central government from building dams to lower the price . In that way it destroys the government 's monopoly . Another cosca will control the food and produce markets . The most powerful ones in Sicily at this time were the Clericuzio cosca of Palermo , which controlled the new construction in all of Sicily , and the Corleonisi cosca of Corleone , which controlled the politicians in Rome and engineered the transportation of drugs all over the world . Then there were the piddling coscas who demanded tribute from romantic youths to sing to the balconies of their beloveds . All coscas regulated crime . They would not tolerate lazy good-for-nothings burglarizing innocent citizens who paid their cosca dues . Those who stabbed for wallets or raped women were summarily punished by death . Also , there was no tolerance of adultery within the coscas . Both men and women were executed . That was understood . Fissolini 's cosca made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was paid to protect a farmer 's livestock , and organized the kidnapping of careless wealthy men . And so it was that Don Aprile and little Astorre , strolling along the streets of their village , were picked up in two vintage American army trucks by the ignorant Fissolini and his band of men . The ten men in peasant clothes were armed with rifles . They plucked Don Aprile off the ground and threw him into the first truck . Astorre , without hesitation , jumped into the open bed of the truck to stay with the Don . The bandits tried to throw him out , but he clung to the wooden posts . The trucks traveled an hour to the base of the mountains around Montelepre . Then everyone switched to horseback and donkey and climbed the rocky terraces toward the horizon . Throughout the trip , the boy observed everything with large green eyes but never spoke a word . Near sunset , they reached a cave set deep in the mountains . There they were fed a supper of grilled lamb and homemade bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Virgin Mary enclosed in a hand-carved dark wooden shrine . Fissolini was devout in spite of his ferocity . He also had a natural peasant courtesy and presented himself to the Don and the boy . There was no doubt he was chief of the band . He was short and built powerfully as a gorilla , and he carried a rifle and two guns on his body belt . His face was as stony as Sicily , but there was a merry twinkle in his eyes . He enjoyed life and its little jokes , especially that he held in his power a rich American worth his weight in gold . And yet there was no malice in him . " Excellency , " he said to the Don , " I do n't want you to worry about this young lad . He will carry the ransom note to town tomorrow morning . " Astorre was eating lustily . He had never tasted anything so delicious as this grilled lamb . But he finally spoke up with cheerful bravery . " I 'm staying with my Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good food gives courage . To show my respect for His Excellency I prepared this meal myself . I used my mother 's special spices . " " I 'm staying with my uncle , " Astorre said , and his voice rang out clear , defiant . Don Aprile said to Fissolini sternly yet kindly , " It 's been a wonderful night-the food , the mountain air , your company . I look forward to the fresh dew in the country . But then I advise you to bring me back to my village . " Fissolini bowed to him respectfully . " I know that you are rich . But are you that powerful ? I am only going to ask for one hundred thousand dollars in American money . " " That insults me , " the Don said . " You will injure my reputation . Double it . And another fifty for the boy . It will be paid . But then your life will be an eternal misery . " He paused for a moment . " I 'm astonished you could be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Excellency , I am a poor man . Certainly I can take what I want in my province , but Sicily is such a cursed country that the rich are too poor to support men like myself . You must understand that you are the chance to make my fortune . " " Then you should have come to me to offer your services , " the Don said . " I always have use for a talented man . " " You say that now because you are weak and helpless , " Fissolini said . " The weak are always so generous . But I will follow your advice and ask double . Though I feel a little guilty about that . No human is worth so much . And I will let the boy go free . I have a weakness for children-I have four of my own whose mouths I must feed . " Don Aprile looked at Astorre . " Will you go ? " " No , " Astorre said , lowering his head . " I want to be with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then let him stay , " the Don said to the bandit . Fissolini shook his head . " He goes back . I have a reputation to keep . I will not be known as a kidnapper of children . Because after all , Your Excellency , though I have the utmost respect , I will have to send you back piece by piece if they do not pay . But if they do , I give you the word of honor of Pietro Fissolini , not a hair of your mustache will be touched . " " The money will be paid , " the Don said calmly . " And now let us make the best of things . Nephew , sing one of your songs for these gentlemen . " Astorre sang to the bandits , who were enchanted and complimented him , ruffling his hair affectionately Indeed it was a magical moment for all of them , the child 's sweet voice filling the mountains with songs of love . Blankets and sleeping bags were brought out of a nearby cave . Fissolini said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ? Some fish , fresh from the water perhaps ? Then some spaghetti and veal for lunch ? We are at your service . " " I thank you , " the Don said . " A bit of cheese and fruit will be enough . " " Sleep well , " Fissolini said . He was softened by the boy 's look of unhappiness , and he patted Astorre on the head . " Tomorrow you will rest in your own bed . " Astorre closed his eyes to fall asleep immediately on the ground next to the Don . " Stay beside me , " the Don said , as he reached his arms around the boy . Astorre slept so soundly that the rising cinder-red sun was over his head when a clatter awoke him . He rose and saw that the hollow was filled with fifty armed men . Don Aprile , gentle , calm and dignified , was sitting on a great ledge of stone , sipping from a mug of coffee . Don Aprile saw Astorre and beckoned to him . " Astorre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger at the man before him . " This is my good friend , Bianco . He has rescued us . " Astorre saw a huge man who , though he was well encased in fat , wore a suit and tie , and seemed to be unarmed , was far more frightening than Fissolini . He had a curly head of white hair and large pink eyes , and he radiated power . But he seemed to blanket that power when he spoke with a soft , gravelly voice . Octavius Bianco said , " Don Aprile , I must apologize for being so late and that you had to sleep like a peasant on the ground . But I came as soon as I got the news . I always knew Fissolini was a dunce , but I never expected him to do this . " There began the sound of hammering , and some men moved out of Astorre 's vision . He saw two young boys , nailing together a cross . Then , lying on the far side of the hollow , he saw Fissolini and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . They were encased by a web of wire and rope , their limbs entwined . They looked like a mound of flies on a lump of meat . Bianco asked , " Don Aprile , which of these scum do you wish to judge first ? " " Fissolini , " the Don said . " He is the leader . " Bianco dragged Fissolini before the Don ; he was still tightly bound , like a mummy . Bianco and one of his soldiers lifted him and forced him to stand . Then Bianco said , " Fissolini , how could you be so stupid ? Did n't you know the Don was under my protection or I would have kidnapped him myself ? Did you think you were just borrowing a flask of oil ? Some vinegar ? Have I ever entered your province ? But you were always headstrong , and I knew you would come to grief . Well , since like Jesus you must hang from the cross , make your apologies to Don Aprile and his little boy . And I will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails . " " So , " the Don said to Fissolini . " Explain your disrespect . " Fissolini stood upright and proud . " But the disrespect was not for your person , Excellency . I did not know how important and dear you were to my friends . That fool , Bianco , might have kept me fully informed . Excellency , I have made a mistake and I must pay . " He stopped for a moment and then shouted angrily and scornfully at Bianco , " Stop those men from hammering those nails . I 'm going deaf . And you ca n't scare me to death before you kill me ! " Fissolini paused again and said to the Don , " Punish me , but spare my men . They followed my orders . They have families . You will destroy an entire village if you kill them . " " They are responsible men , " Don Aprile said sarcastically . " I would insult them if they did not share your fate . " At this moment Astorre , even in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death . He whispered , " Uncle , do n't hurt him . " The Don made no sign of having heard . " Go on , " he said to Fissolini . Fissolini gave him a questioning look , at once proud and wary . " I will not beg for my life . But those ten men lying there are all in my blood family . If you kill them , you destroy their wives and their children . Three of them are my sons-in-law . They had absolute faith in me . They trusted my judgment . If you let them go , I would make them swear their undying loyalty to you before I die . And they will obey me . That is something , to have ten loyal friends . That is not nothing . I am told you are a great man , but you can not be truly great if you do not show mercy . You should n't make a habit of it , of course , but just this once . " He smiled at Astorre . For Don Raymonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no doubt as to his decision . He had always distrusted the power of gratitude , and he believed that no one could direct the influence of free will in any man , except by death . He regarded Fissolini impassively and shook his head . Bianco moved forward . Astorre strode to his uncle and looked him square in the eyes . He had understood everything . He put out his hand to protect Fissolini . " He did n't hurt us , " Astorre said . " He just wanted our money . " The Don smiled and said , " And that 's nothing ? " Astorre said , " But it was a good reason . He wanted the money to feed his family And I like him . Please , Uncle . " The Don smiled at him and said , " Bravo . " Then he remained silent for a long time , ignoring Astorre tugging at his hand . And for the first time in many years the Don felt the urge to show mercy . Bianco 's men had lit up small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawn air carried on the mountain breezes . One of the men came forward and from his hunting jacket took out a fresh cigar and offered it to the Don . With a child 's clarity , Astorre understood this was not only a courtesy but a demonstration of respect . The Don took the cigar , and the man lit it for him within cupped hands . The Don puffed his cigar slowly and deliberately , then said , " I will not insult you by showing you mercy . But I will offer you a business arrangement . I recognize you had no malice and you showed the utmost regard for my person and the boy . So this is the arrangement . You live . Your comrades live . But for the rest of your lives , you will be at my command . " Astorre felt an enormous relief , and he smiled at Fissolini . He watched Fissolini kneel to the ground and kiss the Don 's hand . Astorre noticed that the surrounding armed men puffed furiously on their cigars , and even Bianco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fissolini murmured , " Bless you , Your Excellency . " The Don put his cigar down on a nearby rock . " I accept your blessing , but you must understand . Bianco came to save me , and you are expected to do the same duty . I pay him a sum of money , and I will do the same for you every year . But one act of disloyalty and you and your world will be destroyed . You , your wife , your children , your nephews , your sons-in-law will cease to exist . " Fissolini rose from his knees . He embraced the Don and burst into tears . And so it was that the Don and his nephew became most formally united . The Don loved the boy for persuading him to show mercy , and Astorre loved his uncle for giving him the lives of Fissolini and his ten men . It was a bond that lasted the rest of their lives . The last night in Villa Grazia , Don Aprile had espresso in the garden and Astorre ate olives from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual sociable self . " Are you sorry to leave Sicily ? " the Don asked . " I wish I could live here , " Astorre said . He put the pits of his olives in his pocket . " Well , we will come every summer together , " the Don said . Astorre looked at him like a wise old friend , his youthful face troubled . " Is Caterina your girlftiend ? " he asked . The Don laughed . " She is my good friend , " he said . Astorre thought about this . " Do my cousins know about her ? " " No , my children do not know . " Again the Don was amused by the boy and wondered what would come next . Astorre was very grave now . " Do my cousins know you have such powerful friends like Bianco who will do anything you tell them they must do ? " " No , " the Don said . " I wo n't tell them about anything , " Astorre said . " Not even about the kidnapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omerta had been bred into his genes . Late that night , alone , Astorre went to the far corner of the garden and dug a hole with his bare hands . In that hole he put the olive pits he had secreted in his pocket . He looked up at the pale night blue of the Sicilian sky and dreamed of himself as an old man like his uncle , sitting in this garden on a similar night , watching his olive trees grow . After that , everything was fate , the Don believed . He and Astorre made the yearly trip to Sicily until Astorre was sixteen . In the back of the Don 's mind , a vision was forming , a vague outline of the boy 's destiny . It was his daughter who created the crisis that moved Astorre into that destiny . At the age of eighteen , two years older than Astorre , Nicole fell in love with him and with her fiery temperament did little to conceal the fact . She completely overwhelmed the susceptible boy . They became intimate with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
