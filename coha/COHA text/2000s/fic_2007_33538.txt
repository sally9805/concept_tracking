The following takes place between the hours of 12 P.M. and 1 P.M. Pacific Daylight Time 12:00:04 P.M. PDT The Cha-Cha Lounge , Las Vegas The holding room was located three levels below the gaming floor , in the casino 's deepest subbasement . Yet even here the clatter of coin and the jangle of five hundred clicking , ringing slot machines penetrated the insulated brick walls and seeped through the cheap soundproof ceiling panels-an incessant carnival buzz that rose and fell like a demented organ grinder 's squeeze box . Jack Bauer closed his ears to the noise and barely registered his dismal surroundings ; gray , unpainted walls , avocado-green phone without a press pad or dial , a steel fire gate that led to a concrete corridor , and a windowless steel door that led to the tiny holding cell behind the one-way mirror . Jack approached the glass . He studied the man on the other side , absorbing every detail of the stranger 's clothing , physical characteristics , and mannerisms . Though the man wore a bland , relaxed expression , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was still perched on the edge of a Cha-Cha Lounge-orange fiberglass chair , as if he were going to bolt themoment the door opened . Occasionally he 'd gingerly touch his face , and Jack noticed a fresh bruise under his left eye . Jack pegged the man 's age as well into his fourth decade , though he tried to appear younger . His sandy brown hair-disheveled from the rough treatment he 'd received at the hands of " casino security " - was white-gray under a clumsy dye job . His addict-thin body was clad head-to-toe in denim , the faded blue jacket torn at the sleeve , buttons missing from his shirt . A crumpled cowboy hat lay on the concrete floor next to the man 's scuffed leather boots . " What 's his name , Driscoll ? " Jack asked the casino 's pit boss . " Where 'd he come from ? " Don Driscoll had the strength of a bull and the face of a bull dog , but the manner of a fastidious cat . With meaty hands , he adjusted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowboy calls himself Chester Thompkins . Says he 's a truck driver . He 's got a North Carolina commercial license to prove it . Of course , that do n't mean squat-'specially not with that South Jersey lilt tucked in the back of his throat . " Driscoll was born and raised in Atlantic City , so he would know . " Did he have anything else on him ? " Jack asked . " Drugs ? A weapon ? " Driscoll shook his dark head , his perfectly pomaded hair did n't move . " Just the gimmick , Jaycee . " The pit boss used Jack 's alias because that was the only name he knew . Driscoll also believed J. C. " Jaycee " Jager was using this low-rent , off-the-beaten track casino as a front to launder mob money and pull a little loan sharking scam on the side . " Where 's the device ? " Jack asked . " Morris is examining it now . " " What about his wallet ? " " Curtis took it . He 's running a make on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 'll come back light , if you know what I mean . The Lone Ranger had over forty Gs in his wallet . Ill-gotten gains , says me . " " Who spotted the scam ? " " Chick Hoffman , the croupier at table five . " Driscoll displayed pride . " The roulette table was reset yesterday and the balance was good . Then along comes Jon Voight here , who 's betting careful and winning big . Been here since nine-thirty in the AM . Hoffman got suspicious-naturally , ' cause I trained Chick myself . " " Did Hoffman find the device ? " Driscoll frowned . " Nah . It was Morris , up in the catwalk . Chick could n't scope the scam , but he tripped the silent alarm anyway . O'Brian used X-rays or heat vision or some magic crap to sniff it out . The gizmo was in the guy 's jacket . There were wires in his sleeve , a laser lens hidden behind the cuff button . " Driscoll rubbed his clean shaven jaw . " When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security snatch him up and bring him down here . I saved him for you . " Jack dragged his eyes away from the man behind the mirror , faced Driscoll . " Tell Hoffman there 'll be an extra grand in his envelope at the end of the day . There 'll be a couple of Gs in your envelope , too . " Bauer forced a half-smile . " Good work , Driscoll . " The pit boss brightened considerably . " Thanks Jaycee . " " Do you want me to stick around and help break this bunco rat ? " Jack shook his head . " I 'm going to handle it myself . Do me a favor and find Curtis . I need to know what he dug up on this guy . " " Sure thing , boss . Right away . " Driscoll paused when he reached the fire door , one hand poised on the push bar , he seemed to be gathering his thoughts . " It 's good what you 're doing , Jaycee . It 's the right thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tone was prickly . Sensing his annoyance , Driscoll talked faster . " It 's good to finally make an example , Jaycee . That 's all I meant . Things were getting sloppy around here , across the board . The croupiers , the dealers , the Eyes in the Sky , even the goddamn cocktail waitresses . And the word 's out , you know ? Sorry , but for nearly three months now , ever since you came on board , this casino 's been drawing grifters like a cesspit draws flies . " Driscoll 's watery gray eyes drifted to the man behind the mirror . " Nailing that bastard , dealing with him without the law . . . It 'll send the right message to the right people . After this , nobody 's gon na think Jaycee Jager is an easy mark . Nobody . " Jack fixed a cold stare on Don Driscoll . " I came here from Kansas City to make my mark . And that includes making this dive profitable . That 's what I 'm going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to take down in the process . " Jack shifted his gaze back to their cheater . " Now go find Curtis and send him down here . I 'm going to need some muscle to take care of this son of a bitch . "
