an evening in winter an evening in winter It was the second month of living without a soul and I was getting used to the feeling . The obliteration of the self had begun two years beforeprobably it had begun years beforebut at the brink of being seriously over forty-nine , it was coming into fruition . I saw every mistake I 'd made , also the flaws in my character as well as my bone structure , and the combination of the two was deadly , forcing me to drag around the empty shell of a human form like the lost shadows of Peter Pan and Wendy or of Casper the Ghost . I dragged this around with my new lack of self and missing soul each day . Unlike a number of movie stars , I lacked the will to add false cheekbones . Although there is one early stage of the face falling in that gives the face owner the appearance of having bone structure , I had acknowledged awhile before this newest episode of emptiness and nothingness that the stage of slight structure had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a soft , still-unformed pancake , nothing more . Sometimes passing in front of a mirror , before I 'd learned to avoid the dastardly objects , I 'd seen the beginning of the pancake effect , and a few times this made me laugh out loud . Not the mad laugh of a woman in an asylum , as in the movie Spellbound , but a laugh of disbelief , of incredulousness that this could be happening to me . What had I done to deserve it ? I 'd never smoked or drunk alcoholic beverages . I 'd taken no drugs . I 'd avoided the sun after I found out about it at age thirtytoo late . I tried to practice yoga and walked many miles every day . I 'd been a vegetariansince birth , and then a vegan as soon as possible after that . It had to have been the bad thoughts . It must have been my low opinion of my mother 's middle-aged face , my not having had the smallest inkling that this same facial decline might lie in store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being punished . Also the damage done by the years of forced milk drinking during childhood . That was only the outsideI 'd read that damage to the innards begins after infancy . I pictured plaque deposits starting in first grade , when my mother paid milk money to the teacher so that the little cartons of the thick liquid would be delivered to the classroom , where the unsuspecting children would have to drink it . i 'd had one good dayor was it just a good few minutesplus a grand finale that followed : the drive home from the discount drugstore with a bag of Xanax , a bag of chocolate , and , on the brighter side , a bag of Dr. Scholl 's gel-and-foam innersoles . At the time I still had the high hopes of walking farther and farther each day . The Xanaxwhen I saw how nice and full the bottle wasI 'd gone from thirty tablets at a clip , to sixty , to ninety , and was now hitting the jackpot with one hundred and twenty . But no congratulatory sticker was handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was affixed to the windshield of our Volvo when we reached one hundred thousand miles , though I thought I saw that the pharmacist was impressed when he handed me the bag of pills . Just the thought of the many peach-colored beauties tumbling about and clicking into each other in the newly orange colored bottle , this thought made me calmI did n't have to take a pill or even half of one . The same with the chocolate . I had no plan to ingest any , but just the thought of the big sack full of extra-small-size Hershey bars on sale after Halloween , the thought of the special chocolate-colored foil-wrapped little bars prevented withdrawal from the drug I 'd read was in the mixturetheobromine . If only that were available by itself . I 'd read in Dr. Andrew Weil 's newsletter that those who needed the drug should seek out a good brand of Belgian dark chocolate , or Valrhona , but in a patriotic gesture I never gave up the American brand . Chocolate , a sedative and antidepressant at the same time , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , which might have caused radioactive contamination at the nearby chocolate factory . for weeks , or years , I 'd wished that I had someone to talk to . My closest friend , a twenty-one-year-old boy , was away in rehab for heroin addiction . My other friends were a group of narcissists or anxiety-depressives . Not that they were in any kind of organized group of people who knew who the others were . The narcissists were too narcissistic to care about anyone else and the anxious ones were too anxious to think about anyone but themselves . I was married to a man who liked to say , " You knew when you married me that I did n't talk . " it was exactly the right time of night to be at the discount drugstoreeight-thirtytoo late for children to be running around crying or demanding , sometimes in Spanish , candy and plastic toylike objects , but not close enough to the nine p.m. closing for me to be thrown out before I could gather up all the medium-green Reach toothbrushes with firm bristles . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose every sentence used to infuriate me : I wanted to hear English spoken by cashiers and customers . At least I wanted the cashiers to stop speaking Spanish to each other and help the customers at the counter . " Good evening , may I help you ? " I never heard that . I had heard David Letterman say that when he was a grocery-bagger youth at a supermarket , he used to say " Hello " and " Thank you . " He complained during his shows that the clerks and baggers no longer spoke to or even made eye contact with customers . He did n't mention the Spanish . The more Spanish I heard the more enraged I became . I knew this was another new , bad thing about myself . I had all the time I needed to look through the Dr. Scholl 's innersoles and as I was studying a new light-pink rubbery kind with a miniature waffle pattern I heard a woman 's voice say , " Do n't get those . They 're terrible . " Since I had lived without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled to hear anyone say anything like this to me . I could n't remember the last thing my mother had told me to get or not get . " Get Electrasol , " she had told me about a dish-washing powder after I was married . " It 's far superior , " she added with a conviction that was a waste of her intelligence . I 'd taken the advice and had bought Electrasol ever after , except for an experiment in switching to Ecover , the ecologically preferred brand . When Ecover did n't remove tea stains from cups , I had to go back to the chlorinated Electrasol . I felt bad every time I reached for the box . Some weeks earlier , I 'd been dismayed to find that the Electrasol corporation had fiddled with the original formula and created a blue " Dual Action " product to replace the single- action white powder . The odor of the blue powder almost knocked me out when I opened the box . I remember gasping for breath as I staggered out of the cleanser aisle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the innersole advice , I was alarmed . Because I had seen her on other nights in the half hour before closing time at this drugstore , as well as at the supermarket late at night . Often she and I were the only two customers in either store . She was around fifty , or even older . She had long black hair , too long for her age , too long even for age forty , long black hair halfway down her back , or maybe hanging a few inches lower than the shoulders of her black leather jacket . Yes , black . Black , the darkest and deadliest of the colors . She was dressed head to toe in this color , yet she thought she should speak to me . She wore a black T-shirt underneath the black jacket and tight black pants , too tight for her ten pounds of overweight , and to top all this off she wore black shoeshigh-heeled shoesblack pumps , they may still be called . I had no way of knowing , since I was no longer reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking and climbing magazines were my choices . On her face she wore a load of makeupblack eye makeup for eyebrows and eyeliner , tan powder with liquid face makeup underneath , and thena final brutal shock to my delicate systemshe was wearing bright red lipstick . I was still weak from the night before , when I 'd almost passed out in the cleanser section at the supermarket after stepping into the aisle without even opening the spout on a box of dish-washing powder . The collected chemical fumes from all the detergent boxes were somehow seeping out into the air and I had to flee without even trying to hold my breath long enough to dash up the aisle to get some sponges . i looked up at the face , the whole personage of the woman customer who had taken it upon herself to advise me about the innersoles , and this is what she said : " You can feel the little square sections on the soles of your feet . " " Oh , " I said . " Thanks for telling me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain white foam style . " They wear out too fast , " I said , beginning to feel the shock of being in a conversation with her . " But they 're better , " she said . " Get more and replace them . " Apparently she had n't seen the environmental segment of a program I had just watched on TVit was about getting less . A carpet-company executive had become environmentally responsible after reading a book on the subjectit was " a knife in his heart " or some such dramatic phrase . " I was guilty , " he said . Then he figured out a way to make his carpets last ten years , and during the ten years his company would service and repair the carpets , and when they were beyond repair he 'd take them away and recycle them . A gigantic machine was shown grinding up old carpets and spewing out bits of gray and black rubbery stuff into another machine or bin to make more carpets . The case of Dr. Scholl 's and the topic of recycling was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mounds of worn-out and discarded foam shoe pads in a landfill in New Jersey filled with all kinds of garbage , or at the town dump in Nantucket , where a special dome had to be built to keep the ever expanding waste and accompanying fumes away from the homes of the many new million- and billionaires and their moors-encroaching real estate development . Since almost all of Nantucket was for sale , the land near the dump had some of the best views of the once-beautiful island .
