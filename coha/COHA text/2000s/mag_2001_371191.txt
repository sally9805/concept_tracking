Day of Infamy <P> The tragedy that struck the U.S. Sept. 11 , 2001 , touches everyone SPECIAL ISSUE . Not only is it incomprehensible , but the aftereffects on lives around the world can not be summed up or measured . Anger and fear run deep  --  sorrow even deeper . But ours is a nation of diverse and tolerant people . Let us lead by example and not condemn any group because of the actions of a few . May our anger , fear and sorrow be turned toward compassion , patience and support for everyone affected by these events . In this way may we find strength . MARSHALL SELTZER Saltsburg , Pa . <P> National unity in confronting a crisis is not uniquely American . But it is something we do better than anyone else on earth . While I remain appalled , shocked and outraged , I have never been prouder to be an American citizen . DAVID L. DENVIR Killingworth , Conn . <P> I urge fellow Americans at home and abroad to act with calm and wisdom . In our calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . If we too become indiscriminate terrorists , the hijackers have truly won . MICHELLE ANSORGE Minneapolis , Minn . <P> The Righteousness of Rage <P> I ardently agree with Lance Morrow that we must have the resolve as a people and a nation to vent our rage and seek retaliation ESSAY , SPECIAL ISSUE . I am sickened by the number of appeals for forgiveness that I am already seeing on church announcement boards and hearing from commentators on talk shows . Repressed rage festers like any other infection and weakens us both morally and spiritually . There is nothing inhuman or immoral about venting rage , protecting ourselves or trying to eradicate a poison that is seeking to eradicate our nation . In fact , I believe that to do otherwise is inhuman and immoral . DENA FORSTER Bethesda , Md . <P> Morrow 's is the best response to the crisis I 've read . While I understand something of the government 's caution , I am impatient for us to act . We must retaliate . This country can not afford to show any weakness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . We must vigilantly patrol our coasts and airspace until further notice . As far as I 'm concerned , we should already be bombing Iraq , Libya and Afghanistan until there is nothing left but rubble-filled craters . BETH GRAY Los Angeles <P> Lance Morrow 's polemic was flip , superficial and unhelpful in this time of crisis . What is nourishing about rage ? What is inappropriate about healing ? Is hatred wholesome and intelligent ? Is " self-confident relentlessness " a discipline Americans need to learn ? Following this logic , one would have to conclude that terrorists and those who incite them are spiritually nourished and intelligent and that their " self-confident relentlessness " is something to aspire to . People with less emotional and more thoughtful approaches to crises are not " unfit for decent company , " as Morrow puts it ; rather , they are the real patriots who truly love their country and the human possibilities it stands for . KATHERINE MEEKS New York City <P> Thanks , Lance Morrow . Your thoughts needed to be said . I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
