" Far More Terrible for Women " // It was April 22 , 1944 , a warm Saturday in Washington , D.C. The skies threatened rain , but the cherry trees near the Jefferson Memorial were in bloom , and hundreds of people , many of them soldiers and sailors in uniform , strolled the banks of the Tidal Basin to admire the lacy pink and white foam of the blossoms . News from the war was mostly good : The Marines had recently captured blood-soaked Iwo Jima , the Fifth Army was about to liberate Rome . In the capital city of the United States , however , a small , thin black woman named Pauli Murray had a different sort of liberation in mind . // Murray , due to graduate in June from Howard University Law School , was standing with some other Howard students outside Thompson 's cafeteria , a few blocks northeast of the Tidal Basin . She watched as her fellow students slipped , two and three at a time , inside the cafeteria . Finally , Murray took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray and entered the serving line . When the stone-faced employees behind the steam tables refused to serve her , as they refused to serve any black , Murray silently carried her empty tray to a table and sat down among the other black students who had been turned away . // The silent demonstration at Thompson 's cafeteria , led by Murray and three other Howard activists on a cloudy afternoon in wartime Washington , was a harbinger . But it did more than prefigure many similar actions almost two decades later . It also symbolized the importance of women to a movement that always seemed to be dominated by men . Of the approximately fifty black students who sat in that day at Thompson 's , most were women , and all of the leaders were . Together , they had stepped from behind a historical curtain and , for the moment , were deferring to no one . Sitting at Thompson 's table , waiting to be served , they read textbooks and poetry . Some were glancing at the latest issue of the liberal tabloid newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whites gathered on the sidewalk , where another group of students walked a picket line , carrying placards . One of the placards read : " Are You for HITLER 'S Way ( Race Supremacy ) or the AMERICAN Way ( Equality ) ? Make Up Your Mind ! " And another : " We Die Together . Why Ca n't We Eat Together ? " Some soldiers jeered and taunted the pickets . A woman spat at them . Through it all , " our demonstrators were thoroughly disciplined , " Murray wrote to her friend Eleanor Roosevelt several days later . " No response was made to any taunt .... We clamped down on our teeth and kept our eyes straight ahead . " // The manager of Thompson 's pleaded with the students to leave , but they replied , politely , that they would stay till they could eat . By dinnertime , the cafeteria 's trade had dropped by half . After several desperate telephone calls from Thompson 's manager to his superiors , an order finally came down from the chain 's national headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thompson 's waitresses refused , so the manager and the chain 's district supervisor quickly filled in . For the first time since Reconstruction , a downtown whites-only eating establishment in Washington , D.C. , was serving black customers . // " It is difficult to describe the exhilaration of that brief moment of victory , " Murray wrote long afterward . The sit-in at Thompson 's was the culmination of months of intense planning and training . The participating students had been carefully selected , then rigorously schooled in the nonviolent principles and tactics of Mahatma Gandhi . Each student had signed a pledge not to retaliate against harassment or violence . And it had all worked ! Soon , however , the glow of victory vanished . The press was n't much interested , and the president of Howard University , fearing a backlash from a Congress dominated by Southern racists , ordered the students to suspend further action . Murray was furious that the students ' " brief act of imaginative defiance , a commando raid against entrenched racism ... which , if expanded , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so abruptly and completely throttled . But throttled it was , and , with the pressure lifted , Thompson 's went back to " no Negroes allowed . " // Not until sixteen years later would civil rights demonstrators use the same kind of nonviolent resistance employed by Murray and her fellow students . By then most activists did n't even know who Pauli Murray was . When Eleanor Holmes , a brilliant young Yale law student and member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , returned to Yale for classes after a summer of civil rights work in 1963 , she met Murray , who was then studying for her doctorate in law . Holmes , who as Eleanor Holmes Norton would later become a noted civil rights lawyer and the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , had never heard of the 1944 Howard sit-in . She recalled being stunned on learning about the " nerve and bravery of this little woman who had already done what we were only beginning to do but without the safety and protection of the full-blown movement and reformist national mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to the history of the early civil rights movement in the United States , she and the other Howard women with whom she demonstrated were merely in the middle of a long line of female soldiers of change , black and white , that stretched from the nineteenth-century abolitionist movement forward to twentieth-century civil rights and feminism . Indeed , the interconnections between race and gender , and between racism and misogyny , have helped place women at the very center of social ferment and conflict over the last two centuries of American history . Pauli Murray thus stands as a bridge between present and past . The granddaughter of a slave and great-granddaughter of a slave owner , she sprang from a family whose history , like the histories of countless others , illustrates how far the United States has come since the days of slavery , unbridled racism , and pernicious sexism  --  and how far it has still to go . // From the beginning , from the days of slavery and the drive for abolition , women of both races were deeply involved . Wrote Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antislavery cause shall be written , woman will occupy a large space in its pages ; for the cause of the slave has been peculiarly woman 's cause . " For women , there was a particular spur , a special urgency in the nineteenth-century struggle to abolish slavery . Harriet Jacobs , an escaped slave who wrote a book about her experiences in captivity , put it this way : " Slavery is terrible for men ; but it is far more terrible for women . Superadded to the burden common to all , they have wrongs , and suffering , and mortifications peculiarly their own . " // Slave women were expected to work as diligently and as long as men in the fields , but they also had to bear children , raise them , cook , sew , clean , and perform other household chores for their families . Because the field work was so harsh , and medical care and nutrition so poor , miscarriages and stillbirths were all too common . Many women were weak and in constant physical pain , many looked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirties . Nor did their gender shield women from whippings and the other brutal punishments and treatments of slavery . If their children managed to survive babyhood , they still could be lost forever at the whim of a master who decided to sell them . " Babies was snatched from deir mother 's breasts and sold to speculators , " one old ex-slave recalled after the Civil War . " Chillens was separated from sisters and brothers and never saw each other again . I could tell you about it all day , but even den you could n't guess de awfulness of it . " // Yet brutality and degradation were not the mortifications that Harriet Jacobs wrote about . Uppermost in her mind , as in the minds of most slave women , was the ever-present danger of rape by white men . The silent menace of interracial rape and concubinage hung over the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century South like a dense miasma . Teenage girls were especially vulnerable , never knowing when they might be preyed upon by their master , the master 's son or other relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black women might fight against such assault , they were , more often than not , forced to submit . According to sociologist Louis Wirth , the sexual assault of slave women by white men was ubiquitous throughout the South . Indeed , it was regarded in some quarters as a rite of sexual passage for young white men . " No likely looking Negro , or more especially mulatto , girl was apt to be left unmolested by the white males , " Wirth wrote . " Very few of the young white men grew up ' virtuously ' and their loss of virtue was scarcely to be attributed to cohabitation with white women . " For generation after generation , young black women in the South were refused what most cultures deem the birthright of women : They were , as Maya Angelou put it , " denied chastity and refused innocence . " // Pauli Murray 's maternal grandmother , Cornelia Smith Fitzgerald , was born into slavery as a result of just such a rape , a fact that haunted Murray until the end of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been given as a gift to Mary Ruffin Smith , the daughter of a North Carolina plantation owner , on the young white woman 's eighteenth birthday . Harriet became Mary Ruffin Smith 's personal slave . A few years later , she married a free black farmer and bore a son . But Smith 's two bachelor brothers  --  Sidney , a lawyer and politician , and Frank , a doctor  --  had had their eyes on Harriet , too . Sidney , in particular , took to following her around , frequently cornering her and trying to kiss her . She resisted and began nailing the door of her cabin shut at night . Then , in 1843 , Sidney Smith finally made clear who was master and who was slave . After ordering Harriet 's husband off the plantation , Sidney broke down her cabin door and raped her . He returned to her night after night , until his brother , Frank , waylaid him one evening outside Harriet 's cabin and beat him bloody . Sidney stayed away from Harriet after that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Frank Smith 's throttling of his brother was hardly a protective act . Frank just wanted Harriet for himself , and she ultimately bore him three daughters . Yet he paid no attention to her outside the bedroom . When around others , she invariably approached him with the same servility that she displayed to the other slave-owning Smiths . Her four girls were raised in a kind of limbo in the Smith home . They were regarded as better than field hands yet were not  --  quite  --  house slaves and were not acknowledged as blood kin , either . Their white aunt , not their mother , was the dominant figure of their lives . The two women were linked in a strange kind of motherhood in which , Pauli Murray noted , " the same overpowering forces which had robbed the slave mother of all natural rights had thrust them unwanted upon the childless spinster . " // Mary Ruffin Smith , still unmarried , suffered great shame over her brothers ' behavior . After Harriet gave birth to her second daughter , the family moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gossip . Probably , though , Mary 's shame was relatively mild compared with the humiliation of countless Southern white wives , who discovered that their husbands were forcing themselves on slave women . A wife might pour out her fury , jealousy , and pain in a diary or journal , but she usually did n't dare confront her husband openly . For as cosseted and supposedly hallowed as the white Southern belle famously was , her legal status , in the final analysis , was not much different from that of a slave woman . Declared slavery apologist George Fitzhugh in 1854 , " Wives and apprentices are slaves , not in theory only , but often in fact . " A wife had no rights to speak of  --  no rights over her property or her children , no right to vote , no right to participate in public life . She was , in effect , the possession of her husband , barred from education , prevented from entering business or the professions . " In truth , woman , like children , has but one right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzhugh wrote . " The right to protection involves the obligation to obey ... if she be obedient she stands little danger of maltreatment . " // A white woman 's reward for her submission was to be idealized beyond measure , to be pictured as the quintessence of ethereal loveliness , an angel who devoted her life to caring for her husband , children , and anyone else who needed her help . It was unthinkable for a woman to put her own needs first , unpardonable for her to show any spark of spirit , ambition , or independence . She was expected to perform her wifely duties without complaint  --  which , in the case of a slave owner 's wife , included not only duties toward her own family but also attending to the feeding , clothing , medical care , and other needs of slaves . In many cases , she had far more daily contact with slaves than did her husband . // Fanny Kemble , a strong-willed young English actress who married a Georgia plantation owner in 1834 , was astonished at how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves . From morning to night , they came to her with their cares : " No time , no place , affords me a respite from my innumerable petitioners ; and whether I be asleep or awake , reading , eating , or walking  --  in the kitchen , my bedroom or the parlor , they flock in with urgent entreaties and pitiful stories ... " Opposed to slavery , Kemble raged at her helplessness in the face of the misery she saw every day . One morning , she was visited by a slave woman who was the mother of sixteen children , fourteen of them now dead . The woman also had suffered four miscarriages , one of which occurred after she 'd been tied by her wrists , hung from a tree , and whipped . " And to all this I listen , " Kemble declared , "  --  I , an English woman , the wife of the man who owns these wretches , and I can not say , ' That thing shall not be done again ; that cruel shame and villainy shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman meat and flannel , and remained choking with indignation and grief long after they had all left me to my most bitter thoughts . " ( Kemble 's thoughts on marriage were just as foreign for that time and place as her opinions about slavery . When her husband , Pierce Butler , divorced her in 1849 , he blamed the end of their marriage on his wife 's " peculiar views which ... held that marriage should be a companionship on equal terms .... At no time has one partner a right to control the other . " ) // Although few wives and female relatives of slave owners shared Kemble 's views on the immorality of slavery , many , nonetheless , detested the institution . They bridled at the constant psychological and physical impositions it made on their lives  --  rendering them , as one put it , the " slave of slaves . " // Above all , the wives hated their husbands ' sexual betrayal that slavery had made so easy . The Southern white woman " was confronted with a rival by compulsion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Nor could she hide the mulatto children always underfoot who resembled her own children so strongly that no one could doubt their parentage . " Wrote one planter 's bitter wife : " We are complimented with the names of wives , but we are only the mistresses of harems. " // Unable to strike out directly at their husbands , wives often took out their rage on the husbands ' victims . Fanny Kemble was horrified to learn that the wife of her husband 's overseer had personally supervised the flogging of three slave women , all of whom had recently given birth to children he had fathered . " Jealousy is not an uncommon quality in the feminine temperament , " Kemble observed , " and just conceive the fate of these unfortunate women between the passions of their masters and mistresses , each alike armed with the power to oppress and torture them . " // In the nineteenth-century South , black and white women alike were caught in a tangle of sexual contradictions , repressions , and lies . Perched firmly on their pedestals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure  --  were forced to deny any sexual feelings of their own . Black women , on the other hand , were pictured as passionate animals . Thomas Jefferson , who is believed by some to have produced at least one son with his Monticello slave Sally Hemings , once wondered if black women mated with orangutans . Jefferson 's thinking was not unusual for his time . Female slaves were seen as lusty temptresses who seduced white men , luring them away from the sanctity of their homes and wives , causing men to violate standards their society held sacred . Of course , the roles that Southern white males assigned to women of both races  --  purity for the white woman , animal lust for the black  --  served to assure male domination of both . Neither was allowed to be fully human . Each was " only half of a self , " yearning for the missing piece of identity assigned to women of the other race . // Moreover , placing all blame on slave " temptresses " for interracial sex helped ease white men 's consciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chaste and soulless ideal of white womanhood . It also had far-reaching consequences for the relationships between blacks and whites  --  and blacks and blacks  --  from then on . The image of sexual wantonness has haunted black women , shaping the way they 've been treated by American society since slavery . Writer Willie Morris , for example , grew up in Mississippi in the 1940s believing that white women did n't engage in sex for pleasure , that " only Negro women engaged in the act of love with white men just for fun , because they were the only ones with the animal desire to submit that way . " // The pitting of black women against white women produced suspicions and rivalries that affected the nineteenth-century abolitionist movement , the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s , and the women 's movement . Likewise , white Southerners ' attitudes toward sexuality , sexual predation , the South 's devotion to the ideal of " pure white womanhood "  --  all had profound repercussions on the region and the rest of the country during slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed . Yet these suspicions and rivalries , these attitudes and acts , were largely ignored in the popular press of the day and were long consigned to the shadows of history . Even today , they are seldom publicly discussed . // Sex , nonetheless , has always been inextricably entwined with race and racism . " At the heart of the American race problem the sex factor is rooted , rooted so deeply that it is not always recognized when it shows at the surface , " declared James Weldon Johnson , the noted black poet , writer , and civil rights leader . " ... The race situation will continue to be acute as long as the sex factor persists . " // When Sarah Grimk ? , the daughter of a wealthy slaveholder , was growing up in the genteel South Carolina city of Charleston , she hated many things about slavery . Above all , she hated the psychological havoc it played on women , black and white . For Grimk ? , whose father once told her she could have been the greatest legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , the helplessness of Southern white women was akin to that of slaves . // From an early age , she rebelled against the treatment of both . As a girl , she taught her " little waiting-maid " to read and write : " The light was put out , the keyhole screened , and flat on our stomachs before the fire , with the spelling-book before our eyes , we defied the laws of South Carolina . " There clearly was no room in the South for this budding young abolitionist , and in 1821 she moved up North . Grimk ? ' s younger sister , Angelina , joined her there eight years later . The Grimk ? sisters , two well-brought-up white women from the South , became noted lecturers and writers in the vanguard of the battle for abolition and women 's rights . // According to the law , white women were as subordinate in the North as they were in the South . Lacking legal rights , they were consigned to the home and family . By the 1830s , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and piety in middle-class and upper-class white women , was firmly established in the North . In truth , though , Northern women had been tiptoeing away from the hearth since the beginning of the century , organizing charitable and temperance societies , missionary groups , literary clubs . As these activities were largely sponsored by churches , they were considered perfectly respectable : Their main priority was to help others less fortunate  --  sinners , the heathen , the poor . Few church leaders ( or , for that matter , husbands ) thought they would encourage women 's independence . // Free black women in the North were organizing , too , but with different goals . Unlike white women , most black women had to work outside the home , yet were still hemmed in by legal and social constraints . Theirs was not the " do-gooder " mentality of helping the unfortunate with whom they had little in common . Their societies were more often aimed at mutual relief , designed to help themselves , their families , neighbors , and other blacks for whom poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established schools and orphanages , founded settlement houses , aided their down-and-out sisters . They also organized literary and moral improvement societies , determined to prove that they were just as genteel , just as culture-loving , just as free from moral taint as any white woman . // With antislavery sentiment swelling in New England in the early 1830s , women , black and white , rushed to the abolitionist cause . Maria Stewart , a fiery young black abolitionist and former domestic , caused a furor in 1832 when she urged an audience of men and women at Boston 's Franklin Hall to join the fight . " It is of no use , " Stewart declared , " for us to sit with our hands folded , hanging our heads like bulrushes , lamenting our wretched condition ; but let us make a mighty effort , and arise . " She aimed her message particularly at black women : " How long shall the fair daughters of Africa be compelled to bury their minds and talents beneath a load of iron pots and kettles ? " Stewart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first public lecture ever delivered by a woman in America . Church and civic leaders were so appalled at her audacity  --  the very idea that a woman dare get up in public and make a speech !  --  that she was forced to leave Boston . // Still , the walls had been breached . Women soon organized antislavery societies in Boston , New York , Philadelphia , and other cities throughout the Northeast . Collecting money through fairs and other fund-raising events , they played a crucial role in financing the abolitionist movement . They inundated Congress and state legislatures with hundreds of thousands of signatures collected on antislavery petitions . With mounting confidence , they published magazines , wrote articles , spoke out at meetings , and organized conventions . Along the way , they encountered increasing opposition from men , even from some of their own male allies in the abolitionist cause . In a passionate retort , abolitionist writer Lydia Maria Child asserted : " Some will tell you that women have nothing to do with this question ! ... When Bonaparte told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman talk politics , she replied , ' Sir , in a country where women are beheaded , it is very natural they should like to know the reason . ' And where women are brutalized , scourged and sold , shall we not inquire the reason ? My sisters , you have not only the right , but it is your solemn duty ... " // In 1837 , black and white women abolitionists gathered in New York City for the first Antislavery Convention of American Women . They formally declared that a woman had the right to carve out her own role in fighting slavery , independent of men , the right " to do all that she can by her voice , and her pen , and her purse , and the influence of her example , to overthrow the horrible system ... " Church leaders viewed such bold assertions with growing alarm . All the same , audiences jammed meeting halls throughout the Northeast to hear the Grimk ? s and others link the question of women 's rights with the antislavery movement . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sarah Grimk ? said at one such meeting , " but the cause of woman as a moral , responsible being .... Men and women are created equal ! ... whatever is right for man to do is right for woman . " As far as most churches were concerned , this was akin to heresy . In 1837 , the same year as the women 's antislavery convention , an organization of Congregationalist ministers attacked the Grimk ? s and their upstart female associates , thundering : " The appropriate duties and influence of woman is in her dependence . But when she assumes the place and tone of a man as a public reformer ... we put ourselves in self defense against her ... " // Consternation over this new female spirit of independence was n't the only reason for the widespread anger and hostility toward women abolitionists . Only a small minority of Northerners actively supported the antislavery cause . Many in the North held views that were as racist as those held in the South . The notion that black and white women would meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was regarded as an abomination . There was fury over the resolution against racism passed by the delegates to the 1837 convention , which stated that whites and blacks should treat each other " as though the color of the skin was of no more consequence than that of the hair or the eyes . " Fury turned to violence at the women abolitionists ' 1838 convention in Philadelphia . A mob hurled stones through the windows of a hall where black and white delegates were meeting , then blocked the doors and threatened the women as they left . That night , the hall was set ablaze . Unswayed , the women gathered the next morning to insist they would continue to sit together , eat together , and even have tea together in each other 's parlors. // In Boston and other Northern cities , unruly crowds heckled women abolitionists , sprayed them with ice water , threatened them with bodily harm , and sometimes roughed them up . One Boston newspaper ridiculed that city 's female antislavery society as a " parcel of silly women , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion and riots . " On several occasions , female abolitionists rushed Northern courthouses and rescued fugitive slaves about to be sent back South . Reporting on one such raid , an antiabolitionist newspaper described in horror how " a colored woman of great size who scrubbed floors for a living ... threw her arms around the neck of one officer immobilizing him . " // Other women smuggled fugitive slaves out of the South , via the Underground Railroad , and into the North and Canada . Harriet Tubman , herself a runaway slave , became a legend by leading more than three hundred slaves to freedom during nineteen trips to the South , boasting that she " never lost a single passenger " on her underground railway . With a $40,000 bounty on her head , Tubman carried a pistol to defend herself against bounty hunters . But she also sometimes used the pistol to encourage hesitant runaways . " You 'll be free or die , " she barked . // Black and white women provided stops along the way on the Railroad  --  refuge in their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura Spelman , the future wife of John D. Rockefeller . Another was the wife of the chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court . Shortly after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed in 1850 , making it a crime to harbor runaway slaves , the judge confronted his wife . " What am I going to do ? " he asked . " You know I must enforce the new law and I know what you are doing . " She answered simply , " Just walk right out of the front door and never look back to see what 's going on . " // *** // For all their daring , for all their ringing speeches and awe-inspiring fund-raising , women in the antislavery crusade found they were still regarded as inferior and subordinate , even by many male abolitionists . " Verily , " wrote a sympathetic male supporter , " some of our northern gentlemen abolitionists are as jealous of any interference in rights they have long considered as belonging to them exclusively , as the southern slaveholder is in the right of holding his slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1840 , at the first worldwide abolitionist gathering in London , when women delegates from the United States were refused seats on the floor and confined to a railed-off section on one side . Twenty-four-year-old Elizabeth Cady Stanton , the daughter of a wealthy New York landowner whose abolitionist husband took her to the convention as part of their honeymoon , was so outraged that she promptly enlisted in the fight for women 's rights . In 1848 , she and her close friend Susan B. Anthony were the key figures behind the first Women 's Rights Convention , held in Seneca Falls , New York . The convention marked the beginning of the generations-long struggle for women 's equality in this country . // Before and during the Civil War , Stanton and Anthony regarded the antislavery cause to be inseparable from the fight for women 's rights . Anthony , in particular , was an ardent abolitionist . She traveled nonstop throughout the North as an organizer for the American Antislavery Society , her uncompromising lectures often drawing hostile , catcalling crowds . With Stanton , she lobbied Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free the slaves , and urged other white women to do the same . When the Civil War broke out , Anthony and Stanton put aside the campaign for women 's rights and focused exclusively on ending slavery . // When the war was over and the Thirteenth Amendment a reality , however , Stanton and Anthony argued with more vehemence than ever that it was time for women to be allowed into the tent . Republicans , who dominated Congress , and male abolitionist leaders had other ideas . The newly proposed Fourteenth Amendment , providing " equal protection of the laws " to all citizens ( thus , in effect , granting full citizenship to former slaves ) , included the word " male " as a qualification for voting . Anthony and Stanton urged congressional Republicans to omit the word , but were turned down . Arguing that " this hour belongs to the Negro , " Republican leaders insisted that their party could not bear the political strain of trying to enfranchise women , white or black , along with black men . The " hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend to Negro women , let alone white women . // After ratification of the vaguely worded Fourteenth Amendment , it quickly became clear that yet another amendment was needed to assure voting rights for blacks . As debate raged over the Fifteenth Amendment , Stanton , Anthony , and their forces once again lobbied for the inclusion of women and once again were turned down . Even their male allies in the abolitionist movement  --  including one of their staunchest supporters , Frederick Douglass  --  urged them to step aside . The men argued that while it was important for women to have the vote eventually , it was essential  --  immediately  --  for the physical and economic survival of black men . // Stanton and Anthony felt profoundly betrayed . For well over a decade , they and hundreds of other women had risked a great deal , sometimes even their lives , for the antislavery movement . Was this ... indifference to be their reward ? Their pain was understandable . So was their fury .

While there were white abolitionists who treated their black colleagues as equals , many others were unable or unwilling to reconcile their opposition to slavery with the idea of equality for blacks . In this connection , it is instructive to note that women 's antislavery societies in New York and several other cities would not permit blacks to join . // As for Stanton and Anthony , instead of simply continuing to demand voting rights for men and women , they denounced Congress for favoring " degraded , oppressed " men over the " daughters of Jefferson , Hancock and Adams . " While the Republicans had " lifted up two million black men and crowned them with the honor and dignity of citizenship , they have dethroned fifteen million white women  --  their own mothers and sisters , their own wives and daughters  --  and cast them under the heel of the lowest orders of manhood .

Their racism alienated many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage and abolitionist causes , resulting in a fateful schism in the crusade for women 's rights . // As the abolitionist and women 's movements tore themselves apart over the Fifteenth Amendment , the quarreling players  --  white women , and white and black men  --  largely ignored the interests of the other major actors in the drama : black women . Seeking a political voice for themselves , white women turned their backs on allies who had fought with them for women 's rights and an end to slavery . Black newspapers , meanwhile , urged black women to be " true women " and defer to their men . // Black female activists were caught in a terrible dilemma . If they backed Stanton and Anthony , they would be throwing in their lot with women who were prepared to deny the major right of citizenship to black women 's fathers and brothers and husbands , thereby assuring continued white hegemony over blacks . But if black women supported voting for black men only , they would be endorsing a plan that would give them no voice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the battle over the Fifteenth Amendment was not an isolated event . In the century to come , black women would remain largely invisible to the public eye  --  in the renewed fight for women 's suffrage in the early 1900s , in the modern civil rights movement , and in the blossoming of the women 's movement in the late 1960s . When one talked about " blacks , " one usually meant black men . When " women " were discussed , the emphasis was on white women . // Anguished by the choice they were forced to make after the Civil War , many African-American women gave up the struggle for their own suffrage and aligned themselves with black men . As Frances Harper , a noted black abolitionist writer and lecturer , wrote about herself : " When it was a question of race , she let the lesser question of sex go .

" // In the end , Congress passed and the country ratified the Fifteenth Amendment for men only . Despite the racist attitudes of the leading white suffragist leaders , black women continued to work with them in the drive for passage of a women 's suffrage amendment . Sojourner Truth set out again to lecture for women 's rights , and Harriet Tubman joined a Geneva , New York , suffrage club . " Do you really believe that women should vote ?
