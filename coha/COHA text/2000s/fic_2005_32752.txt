" I remember when you used to stroke me like that . " Marisela Morales punctuated her pickup line by blowing on the back of Francisco Vega 's neck . She watched the soft downy strands on his nape spike and knew her luck had finally turned around . His fingers , visible as she glanced over his shoulder , drew streaks through the condensation on his beer bottle . Up and down . Slow and straight . Lazy , but precise . He toyed with his cerveza the same way he 'd once made love to her , and for a split second , a trickle of moist heat curled intimately between Marisela 's thighs . For the moment , the part of her Frankie used to oh-so-easily manipulate was safe , encased beneath silky panties and skin-tight , hip-hugging jeans . Tonight , she 'd have him  --  but on her terms . The hunter had found her prey . Now , she just had to bring him in . " I do n't remember taking time for slow strokes when you and me got busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her hot breath one more time before she slid onto the bar stool next to his . She 'd been trying to track the man down for nearly a week . Who knew Frankie would turn up at an old haunt ? Since they 'd parted ways , Club Electric , a white box on the outside , hot joint on the inside , had changed names , hands , and clientele a good dozen times . But a few things remained constant  --  the music , the raw atmosphere  --  and the availability of men like Frankie , who defined the word caliente . Like the song said , Hot , hot , hot . " We were young then , " Marisela admitted with a shrug , loosening the holster strap that cradled the cherished 9mm Taurus Millenniumshe wore beneath her slick leather jacket . " Now , I 'm all grown up . " Marisela wiggled her crimson fingernails at Theresa , the owner of the club . The way the older woman 's face lit up , Marisela figured she was going to get more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were her aunt , but now was n't the time for ... " Oh , Marisela ! Mija , how can I thank you for what you did ? " The sentiment was as loud as it was sincere . So she 'd done a nice thing for Theresa . The world did n't have to know . Good deeds could ruin her reputation . And a simple thank-you was n't enough for Theresa . She stepped up onto the shelf on the other side of the bar and practically launched herself into Marisela 's arms . Rolling her eyes at Frankie , Marisela gave the owner a genuine squeeze . She deserved as much . She was a good listener , kept great secrets and mixed the best Cuba Libre in town . " De nada , Theresa , " Marisela said , gently disentangling herself . She appreciated the woman 's gratitude , but she had work to do . " Anything for you . Anytime . For you , drinks are on the house from now on , okay ? You and ... your friend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theresa 's voice faltered when her eyes met Frankie 's . Marisela 's ex had n't been in the neighborhood for years . And in that time , he 'd aged . His skin , naturally dark , now sported a rough texture , complete with a scar that traced just below his bottom lip . His jaw seemed sharper and his once perfect nose now shifted slightly to the right  --  likely the result of an untreated break . Even if he had n't matured from a devilish boy to a clearly dangerous man , he likely would n't be recognized by anyone but Marisela and a few others who 'd once known him well  --  the very " others " Marisela had made sure would n't come into Club Electric again , on Theresa 's behalf . " I never say no to free booze , " Marisela answered . " Gracias , Theresa . " Theresa blew Marisela a kiss , patted her cheek , then moved aside to work on her drink . To most people , a Cuba Libre was just rum and Coke with lime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What did you do for her ? " Frankie asked , his voice even , as if he was n't really curious . Marisela knew better . She slid her arms on the bar , arching her back , working out the kinks in her spine while giving Frankie an unhampered view of her breasts . She did n't want him to waste his curiosity on what she 'd done for Theresa ; she wanted to pique his interest another way . " Last week , las Reinas chose this bar as their new hangout . Not quite the clientele Theresa has in mind . Gangs are n't exactly good for business . I politely asked them to pick someplace else . " " Politely ? " Frankie asked , his dark eyebrows bowed over his hypnotic eyes . " Last I remember , las Reinas did n't respond well to polite . " Marisela shrugged . She 'd earned a great deal of respect from her former gang by choosing to bleed out . She 'd used every fighting skill she 'd ever learned , every survival instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gang . But she 'd survived . Barely . " They 've learned some manners while you 've been gone . Lots of things have changed . Like , " she said , snagging his beer around the neck and taking a sip , " I do n't settle for fast and furious no more . " Frankie did n't move a muscle . " Is that so ? " She smoothed her tongue over her teeth , then licked the lip of his bottle , careful not to smudge her ruby red lipstick . He snagged his drink back and chugged , his gaze locked on her mouth . Frankie always had a thing for her lips . Marisela thought they resembled something between Angelina Jolie and a grouper , but Frankie considered her thick , pouty flesh mighty fine . A detail she intended to use to her advantage , now that she 'd found the man . Theresa delivered her rum and Coke , tall and icy with a wedge of lime . After another wary glance at Frankie , she left them alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where else am I gon na go ? This is West Tampa , not Miami . We 've got one club and this is it . " " There 's always Ybor City . " " If you do n't mind drunks who ca n't dance and ridiculous cover charges . This is still the neighborhood hot spot . You 'd know that if you came around more . " " I 've been busy , " he answered , draining the rest of his beer . She sipped her spiked cola . " And how was prison ? " He chuckled , slid his beer bottle away . " Big party , " he quipped . " I got out two years ago . " " Really ? I had n't heard . " He snorted . He likely knew as well as she did that the precise location and activities of all the neighborhood kids  --  young , old , and in between  --  were reported , catalogued , and reported again from the shiny vinyl chairs of Viola 's Beauty Parlor , two blocks south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . And thanks to Aida Morales 's devotion to the Saturday morning religion of gossip and speculation , Marisela knew precisely what Frankie had been up to over the last decade as if she 'd been there herself . Gang . Prison . Dock work in Miami . Nothing too complicated . Then a week ago , he 'd shown up in Tampa uninvited and unexpected . After less than an hour in town , he 'd been arrested for possession . Thanks to his parents , he 'd made bail  --  and then he 'd promptly disappeared . Which was why she was here . " So what have you been up to , Marisela ? " Her turn to snort . " Nothing too exciting . I did nails for a while . Worked at Wal-Mart . Graduated to Saks . Did some phone work and filing for Alberto Garcia , on the side . Now , I 'm looking again . " She conveniently left out the parts his mother could n't possibly have told him . Hardly anyone knew that her work for Alberto went beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bail Bonds had helped her out when her gang activity landed her in juvie . Instead of processing the teen and sending her on her way , he 'd promised her a job . A real job . One where she 'd put her fighting skills and gun experience to good use . She 'd run little errands for him and trained her ass off until she turned twenty-one . Then , he 'd put her in enforcement . For seven years , she 'd tracked down bail-jumping bozos all across the state . But Alberto had been careful not to send her into her own neighborhood to pick up strays . Called it a conflict of interest . So her secret life was safe . A good thing , too , since Frankie might not be so anxious to relive a little heat from their past if he knew she still carried a gun . Illegally , but that was a fact she continued to ignore . She 'd lost her license to carry and immediately thereafter , her position with AAA-Able . But she had n't given up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt them , but ditching her weapon could get her killed . " So , you 're short on cash , " Frankie said with a nod , his lips slightly pursed , hinting that maybe he knew more than she 'd hoped . " Who is n't ? " " Chasing deadbeats does n't appeal anymore ? " Damn . Frankie might have been away for a while , but he obviously still had contacts . Still , she wiggled her newly polished nails , the index fingers tipped with tiny fake diamonds , and hoped to play down his knowledge of her enforcement activities . " Too hard on the manicure . " He chuckled . " Were you good ? " She sipped her Cuba Libre , enjoying the burst of the sweet carbonation against the smooth tang of the rum . " I 'm good at lots of things . " " I remember . " Man , Frankie had some incredible eyes . Technically , they were hazel , but the flecks of green glittered as deep and vivid as fine oriental jade . Offset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  every one of which Marisela could imagine in great detail . " Wan na dance ? " she asked , flicking a glance at the dance floor . At Club Electric , the music pulsed as hard and bright as the neon lights . The minute Marisela allowed herself to acknowledge the sounds , the rhythm seeped into her veins . Her shoulders and hips rocked and her feet itched to hit the dance floor and work off some of the fiery vibe slashing between her and Frankie . " No , " he answered . She did n't hide her disappointment , pushing her lips into a thick pout . " Why not ? " " Not in the mood . " She leaned forward , her lips inches from his ear as the crowd around them whooped and sang a chorus of " Yo Vivir , " a cover of Gloria Gaynor 's " I Will Survive , " by Celia Cruz . " I can always put you in the mood , Frankie . " She shimmied her shoulders ever so slightly . " Like no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marisela . Did n't take much to put either of us in the mood . " She laughed , punched him in the shoulder then downed a few more gulps of her drink . A flush of warm heat surrounded her skin and she did n't know if the reaction stemmed from their proximity to the writhing masses of dancers or from being so close , and yet so far , from her first love . Back in high school , she and Frankie had melted more than one dance floor  --  not to mention the damage they 'd done to various backseats . He 'd loved her wild ways , her innate curiosity . She 'd wanted to explore the world , find her place outside the tight community she loved , but still resented . To date , she had n't gone anywhere too exotic , but her ambitions had n't died , even if they were harder to pursue with bills hitting the mailbox like baseball-size hail . Even after he 'd chosen his gang over her , he 'd kept her secrets . He 'd never popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst thing he 'd ever done was break her teenage heart . Now she was about to screw him in the worst possible way . Or maybe , the best way ? Did n't matter . Bottom line  --  she was going to royally piss him off , although for a good cause . A very noble cause . The noblest . Marisela may have skirted the law from time to time  --  well , she 'd actually flashed and mooned the law on one or two occasions  --  but give her a benevolent purpose and she could be downright patriotic . And ruthless . Not that she needed a good reason to spend a little quality time with sexy , dangerous , Frankie Vega . But lucky for her , she had a good reason all the same . He was about to jump bail and she was going to stop him . She finished her drink , slipped her fingers into her jacket pocket , threw a ten onto the bar , and nodded toward the door . " If you do n't want to dance , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Frankie moved only to tilt his head toward hers so she 'd hear him over the music and the crowd . " How do you know I 'm not waiting for someone ? " Surrendering to her instincts , Marisela drew one of her long fingernails over Frankie 's angular jawline . " I do n't . But you just got a better offer . " Knowing she had to seal the deal , she dropped her touch slowly down his neck , until the ruby red enamel on her nail sparkled beside the gold chain he 'd worn since his confirmation . Unlike the other Cuban-American males in this part of the world , Frankie did n't dangle a crucifix or saint 's medallion from the necklace . No sense in contradicting his daily activities . He wore the gold serpentine necklace flush to his dark skin , even if the links probably pinched the hell out of his chest hair every once in a while . Marisela grabbed his open collar and with surprise on her side , yanked him to his feet . Frankie was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet  --  but to her tall-for-her-genes five foot seven , he towered over her just enough so she could glance through the veil of her eyelashes when she spoke . " Do you understand what I 'm offering ? " Before he could answer , she slipped her free hand between them and cupped her palm over the bulge in his jeans . She smiled , a thrill streaking through her like lightning . He was hard . As a rock . Thinking he 'd want her again was one thing . Knowing stole her breath . Like the charmer he was , Frankie seized her winded moment and kissed her . Not hot and impatient like he used to . Oh , no . The son of a bitch took his time , pressing his lips against hers like a warm iron on a silk blouse , careful not to scorch her by pressing too hard . His hands inched from her hips to her ribs , his fingers tantalizing the bared skin of her midriff with hungry , yet contained caresses . Harvesting all her self-control , Marisela forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie 's lips were still puckered . He had the audacity to grin as if he 'd been the one to push her away . " Blast from the past too much for you , vidita ? " Marisela slipped her hands into the pocket of her jacket . Feeling the handcuffs she 'd hidden there , she remembered the true purpose of this seduction . She scooted away from her stool , away from him  --  knowing he had every motivation to follow . " Too much for me ? " she asked , sassy and doubtful at the same time . " I 'm just getting started . "
