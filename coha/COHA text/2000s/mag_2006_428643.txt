All onions are not alike . Discover which types are the best choices for your garden and kitchen . Photograph // Onions occupy an important place in the culinary world due to their wide variety and versatility . Sweet and mild onions can be enjoyed raw in salads or lightly cooked in summer salsas and stir-fries , while pungent varieties add body and flavor to meats , marinaras and winter soups . If bulb onions are n't near the top of your shopping or garden-planting list , they should be . Many varieties of onions make excellent storage crops , so put onions in your garden and reap a harvest of beautiful bulbs that will enliven your kitchen in any season . COOKING AND CUTTING TRICKS " There are no bad onions ; you just have to use them correctly , " says Bill Randle , a professor of horticulture at the University of Georgia who specializes in onion flavor . The pungency of onions can be rated on a numeric scale based on the amount of pyruvic acid present in the bulbs . For example , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' Vidalia - is among the mildest onions and might rate between 1 and 4 , while many other sweet onion varieties - such as the ' Texas Super Sweet ' - have ratings between 3 and 5 . Storage onions , often called dry onions , contain more pyruvic acid and often rate between 7 and 12 . Photograph Above : Harvesting a bumper crop of onions in a Maine garden . Top right : Red and white onion bulbs . Right : Onions mulched to suppress weeds . Opposite page : Yellow ' Newburg ' storage onions . // Many storage onions are delicious when cooked , but almost inedible when raw . " Most people ca n't hold a raw 8 in their mouth , " Handle says . " But when I 'm making chili , that 's what I want . " Cooking spicy storage onions not only adds flavor to food , but can make the onions quite sweet ( see " Caramelized Onions , " Page 44 ) . Onions are complex chemical powerhouses , but their fury is not unleashed until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cascade of eye-irritating sulfur compounds hits die air . Cooks have many methods for taking the tears out of chopping onions , but according to Randle , the best idea is to chill the onion first . " The irritating compounds volatize at 50 degrees , so if the onion temperature is lower than that , it wont make you cry , " he says . The chef 's trick of leaving the base of the onion intact can help , too , because pungency compounds are most concentrated in the base and center of the bulb . Want to turn up the volume of onion flavor ? Finely chopping onions increases the number of open cells , which delivers more flavor to cooked foods than leaving onions in larger pieces . When chopped onions are left to sit , their flavor compounds continue to change and rearrange themselves , which can lead to bitter off-flavors . " Cut or chop onions as close to the time you plan to use them as you can , " Randle says . HEART-HEALTHY PROPERTIES Here 's another reason to eat onions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when chopping onions are good for your heart . Onions act as a natural blood thinner that can reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke . Cooking breaks down the heart-healthy sulfur compounds , so the solution is to find heartburn-free ways to consume raw onions . While mild onions have fewer of these health-enhancing compounds than pungent onions , they can be a better choice for heart health because people are more likely to eat them raw . " I call it the pungency paradox , " says Irwin Goldman , a professor of horticulture at the University of Wisconsin . Goldman suggests two additional ways to enjoy raw onions : onion sprouts , which are eaten like bean sprouts ; and onion flowers . " Onions kick on their defensive machinery early , so the compounds are quite concentrated in sprouts . They have a wonderful , sharp flavor when added to salads or sandwiches . Onion flowers have higher levels of medicinal compounds than the bulbs , and they taste fabulous when used in place of raw , chopped onions . " CHOOSING VARIETIES Each ring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf , so onion plants that have many big leaves when they form bulbs will produce the best and biggest onions . That means that providing onions with a long , stress-free growing season is the key to growing robust bulbs . " You 'll get the best crop by fitting your climate with onion maturation , which gives the plants longer to grow before they bulb , " says Chris Cramer , head of the onion breeding program at New Mexico State University . Onions are extremely sensitive to day length , which signals them to begin bulbing . Because of this , you should look for onion varieties that are adapted not only for your climate , but also to your specific latitude , which is directly related to the hours of daylight your garden receives ( see map above ) . Choosing a variety adapted for far north or far south of where you live often means that the onions you plant wo n't form bulbs at all . Photograph ' Ailsa Craig ' onions are a sweet variety . // Onions are adapted for different day lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of onion grows best . // In general , there are three different onion types : * Short-day onions wait until days last 10 to 12 hours to begin forming bulbs . They are the best choices in the South where onions can be grown through winter or planted in early spring . Short-day onions that mature before hot weather begins often taste sweet , and many of the sweetest onions are short-day varieties . Most short-day varieties also are juicy and store well for only a few weeks , even when refrigerated . Popular varieties include ' Texas 1015 ' and ' Granex ' hybrids . * Intermediate-day onions start bulbing when days last 12 to 14 hours and usually do well in the middle of the United States . These onions are dense and pungent , and store better than short-day onions . Some intermediate-day varieties , such as ' Super Star ' and ' Candy , ' can mature into moderately sweet onions under perfect conditions , but most of these onions are pungent . Most are hybrids developed from a combination of shortday and long-day varieties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming bulbs , so they grow best in Northern regions , where there are many hours of daylight during the summer months . Long-day onions are usually dense and pungent with thick , papery skins that protect them from moisture loss , so they often store well for many months . Most long-day onions sold as plants are hybrids , but if you 're starting from seed you can grow outstanding open-pollinated varieties such as ' New York Early ' or elongated ' Red Tropea . ' PLANTING ONIONS Gardeners growing bulb onions have to choose among planting with seed , sets or seedlings . Onion sets are small bulbs stored from the previous year 's crop ; seedlings are young onion plants that have n't yet formed bulbs . Starting from seed is inexpensive , but is the most challenging option . Properly stored fresh onion seed germinates well at 60 to 75 degrees , but if heavy rains cause a crust of soil to form over the seeds after they are planted , then emergence rates can be low . Onions compete poorly with weeds . When starting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinny , upright plants from being smothered by pushy neighbors . Newly sprouted seedlings also need time to grow before bulbing , so starting from seed is most practical in the mild winters of Zones 8 and 9 , where onions can be seeded in fall and grown through winter . Photograph Above : These onions are being prepared for storage . Right : Onions can be braided just like garlic . // Both sets and seedlings are easy to handle , but fewer choices are available for sets . Starting with either gives onions a six-week head start and avoids one of the main pitfalls of growing onions : bolting , which is what happens when onions form flowers . Bolted onions do form bulbs , although they are small and do n't store well . Some varieties are naturally bolt-resistant , but exposure to cold weather can trigger a flowering response in any onion variety . Be sure to wait until at least six weeks before your last spring frost to plant sets or seedlings . Even then , a late cold snap can cause your largest plants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn gluten herbicides when growing onions from sets or seedlings . ( Do n't use corn gluten if you 're planting onion seeds because it will kill them . ) In addition to slowing weed emergence , corn gluten herbicide raked into the planting row or bed provides a good dose of nitrogen as it decomposes . Another option is hand weeding , followed with a light mulch in late spring . Bruce " Onion Man " Frasier , co-owner of Dixondale Farms in Texas , which produces 420 million onion seedlings each year , says the ideal planting size is an onion slightly smaller than a pencil . " Plants that are much larger have a tendency to bolt , " he says . " Smaller plants will produce bulbs , but you can get two crops by planting the small ones 2 inches apart and pulling every other onion to use as scallions during the growing season . This will leave you with the 4-inch spacing you need to grow big bulbs . " The best soil for onions is fertile sandy loam , but any kind of soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for onions . Rotating your crops from year to year is the best way to prevent onion diseases such as pink root and others caused by soilborne fungi . Rotating also can help you escape problems with insect pests such as onion root maggots . Where this pest is widespread , the best defense is to start your crop beneath row covers . FLAVOR AND STORAGE If you prefer onions with sweet and mild flavors , several techniques can help lower the pungency of your onions . If you need to enrich your garden soil , one possibility is to mix an organic fertilizer into the soil beneath the planting row , rather than broadcasting it throughout the bed . This technique , called banding , has two advantages : The shallow onion roots are sure to find the fertilizer and will probably use up most of it by the time bulbing begins . Handle notes that onions that exhaust soilborne nutrients as they approach maturity - yet still receive ample water - often have a mild flavor because their ability to make sulfur compounds decreases as nutrient levels fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply also is important because stress from short-term drought causes onions to accumulate more of the compounds that cause pungency . It 's best to use watering methods that keep the leaves dry , such as drip lines or soaker hoses . " Overhead watering encourages fungal diseases , which limit the leaves ' ability to store carbohydrates for bulb formation , " Frasier says . Once onion bulbs begin to form , ample watering can help dilute the flavor compounds in the onions , resulting in a milder taste . The story changes as onion tops fall over , signaling maturity . Mature onions will store best if the bulbs are allowed to dry out during their last days in the ground . If rainy weather hits just as the tops fall over , it 's best to pull up the bulbs and move them to cure in a warm , dry place . Take care to avoid bruising , which can lead to rotten spots , and either hang the bulbs or spread them out on newspapers to dry . In only four days or so at 85 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the necks should tighten and close as the outer layers form papery scales . Cured sweet onions are so packed with water that they should be stored in the refrigerator . Harder , pungent onions can be kept in a cool , dry place with good air circulation between the bulbs . Sidebar Caramelized Onions A terrific way to cook the more pungent onion varieties is to caramelize them . Slowly cooking the onions brings out their natural sweetness , and caramelized onions are so versatile they can be used as a foundation for rich French onion soup , slipped into a grilled cheese sandwich , stirred into mashed potatoes or mixed with any steamed vegetable . First , slice the onions vertically , then saut them in olive oil until they become translucent . Continue cooking them over medium-low heat for about 25 minutes , stirring frequently . When they are done , they should be a rich brown color . A teaspoon of balsamic vinegar can intensify the flavor .
