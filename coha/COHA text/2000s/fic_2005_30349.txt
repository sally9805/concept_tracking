The Hunter , rifle in his hands , dug in a heel and came to a sudden halt on the game trail , motionless , nearly invisible in a thicket of serviceberry and crowded pines . He heard something . The first rays of the sun flamed over the ridge to the east , knifing through the pine boughs and morning haze in translucent wedges , backlighting tiny galaxies of swirling bugs . Soon the warming air would float up the draw and the pines would whisper like distant surf , but in the lull between the cool of night and the warmth of day , the air was still , the sounds distinct . The Hunter heard his own pulse . The scraping of branches against his camouflage sleeves was crisp and brilliant , the snapping of twigs under his boots almost startling . And the eerie howl was clear enough to reach him from miles away , audible under the sound of the jays and between the chatterings of a squirrel . He waited , not breathing , until he heard it again : long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguished note to the point of agony before trailing off . The Hunter 's brow crinkled under the bill of his cap . The howl was too deep and guttural for a wolf . A cougar never made a sound like that . A bear ? Not to his knowledge . If it was his quarry , it was upset about something . And far ahead of him . He moved again , quickstepping , ducking branches , eyes darting about , dealing with the distance . Before he had worked his way through the forest another mile , he saw a breach in the forest canopy and an open patch of daylight through the trees . He was coming to a clearing . He slowed , cautious , found a hiding place behind amassive fallen fir , and peered ahead . Just a few yards beyond him , the forest had been shorn open by a logging operation , a wide swath of open ground littered with forest debris and freshly sawn tree stumps . A dirt road cut through it all , a house-sized pile of limbs and slash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing , a hulking , yellow bulldozer sat cold and silent , its tracks caked with fresh earth . A huge pile of logs lay neatly stacked near the road , ready for the logging trucks . He saw no movement , and the only sound was the quiet rumble of a battered pickup truck idling near the center of the clearing . He waited , crouching , eyes level with the top of the fallen tree , scanning the clearing , searching for the human beings who had to be there . But no one appeared and the truck just kept idling . His gaze flitted from the truck to the bulldozer , then to the huge pile of logs , and then to the truck again where something protruding from behind the truck 's front wheels caught his eye . He grabbed a compact pair of binoculars from a pocket and took a closer look . The protrusion was a man 's arm , motionless and streaked with red . Looking about , the Hunter waited just a few more seconds and then , satisfied that no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the clearing , stepping carefully from rock to stump to patch of grass , trying to avoid any soil that would register his footprints . The truck was parked in nothing but loose soil , freshly chewed by the bulldozer , but he would have to deal with that problem later . He was planning his moves as he went along . He reached the truck , slowed with caution , and then eased around it , neck craning , in no mood for gruesome surprises . What he found on the other side was no surprise , but it was gruesome , and definitely a complication . Cursing , he leaned against the truck 's hood , warily scanned the tree line and the logging road , and started weighing his options . The crumpled body on the ground was obviously one of the logging crew , most likely the foreman who 'd lingered alone too long on the site the previous evening , judging from the stiff condition of his body . He lay on his belly in the dirt , his body crushed , dried blood streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a broken neck . His hard hat lay top down several feet away , and the ground around the truck was littered with metal shreds of what used to be a lunch box and scattered , chewed-up plastic wrappings that used to hold a lunch . I do n't have time for this ! The Hunter quickly stifled his rage . He needed to calculate , foresee , plan . His gaze shifted to the pile of logs . That might be an option . He could make it look like an accident that would explain the bent , torn , rag-doll condition of the dead man . Were the keys in the bulldozer ? Leaving his rifle by the truck , the Hunter ran to the bulldozer , clambered up on the big steel track , and stepped into the cab . He sank into the worn and torn driver 's seat and searched the panel for the keys . Then he sniffed a chuckle of realization : Of course . This was n't in town , where idle punks drifted about looking to steal anything not locked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for joyriding . The key was in the ignition . It had been a while since his college summers with the construction crew , but if this thing was anything like that track hoe he used to operate . . . He clicked the key over to Preheat , waited , then turned the key to Start . The dozer cranked to life with a puff of black smoke . His mind was racing , still planning , as he put the mountainous machine into gear and got it moving . Reverse came easily enough . Forward was easier . With careful manipulation of the brakes and levers , he brought the dozer to the back of the log pile , then left it there , still running . Hauling the dead man across the ground would be messy , but it was the only option . The Hunter grabbed the man 's wrists -- the right arm was intact , but the left arm had been snapped above the elbow and flexed like a rubber hose -- and started pulling . He tugged and dragged the body over limbs , grass , rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrung neck and scraped on the ground . When the Hunter reached the front of the log pile , he let go of the arms . The stiffened body flopped into the dust . Seated once again in the dozer , he edged the machine forward , reaching under the logs with the bucket . With a calculating , steady pull of the lever , he raised the bucket , lifting the logs , lifting , lifting , until . . . The pile upset . The logs rolled and rumbled down , bouncing , tumbling one over the other , drumming the ground , kicking up dust . The dead man 's body disappeared beneath a jackstraw pile of logs . No time , no time ! The Hunter eased the dozer back to its resting place , switched it off , and leaped to the ground . He ran back to the idling truck and pocketed every metal scrap , every torn plastic wrapper he could find . Then , slinging his rifle over his shoulder , he spotted and grabbed a broken-off evergreen bough and went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footprint with rapid side-sweeps as he backed out of the clearing . As expected , he heard the slowly rising sound of a vehicle coming up the logging road , climbing switchbacks , lurching through gears , rattling over potholes , and growling over gravel . He crouched and headed for the trees , tossing away the branch . Just as he slipped into the forest , a truck pulled into the clearing on the other side . He stole through the crowded timber , planting every footstep silently in the soft , pine-needled ground . Truck doors slammed . Voices lifted , followed by cries of alarm . Those loggers were going to have quite a morning .
