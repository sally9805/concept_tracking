The next time you 're motoring through the United Arab Emirates , you might want to keep an eye on the speedometer . As part of a $125 million deal , IBM will next year start equipping tens of thousands of cars , commercial trucks and government autos with devices to alert drivers  --  and authorities  --  when vehicles are speeding . The technology , which includes a GPS and two-way communications link , is meant to stem the U.A.E. 's record of auto fatalities  --  38 a year per 100,000 citizens , which is more than twice that of the U.S. Privacy issues notwithstanding , with all that data government will , ostensibly , be able to better deal with congestion and plan new roads . Companies could eventually cash in too , says Michael R. Nelson , director of Internet technology and strategy at IBM . With this sort of network , insurers could spot high-risk drivers ( and raise their rates ) , and hotels and restaurants could pipe ads into cars when they 're nearby . Says Nelson : " There 's real money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those cars . "  --  B.K.
