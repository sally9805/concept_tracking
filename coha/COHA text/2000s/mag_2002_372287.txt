Sleep is a funny thing . We 're taught that we should get seven or eight hours a night , but a lot of us get by just fine on less , and some of us actually sleep too much . A study out of the University of Buffalo last month reported that people who routinely sleep more than eight hours a day and are still tired are nearly three times as likely to die of stroke  --  probably as a result of an underlying disorder that keeps them from snoozing soundly . <P> Doctors have their own special sleep problems . Residents are famously sleep deprived . When I was training to become a neurosurgeon , it was not unusual to work 40 hours in a row without rest . Most of us took it in stride , confident we could still deliver the highest quality of medical care . <P> Maybe we should n't have been so sure of ourselves . An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association points out that in the morning after 24 hours of sleeplessness , a person 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally intoxicated . Curiously , surgeons who believe that operating under the influence is grounds for dismissal often do n't think twice about operating without enough sleep . <P> " I could tell you horror stories , " says Jaya Agrawal , president of the American Medical Student Association , which runs a website where residents can post anonymous anecdotes . Some are terrifying . " I was operating after being up for over 36 hours , " one writes . " I literally fell asleep standing up and nearly face planted into the wound . " <P> " Practically every surgical resident I know has fallen asleep at the wheel driving home from work , " writes another . " I know of three who have hit parked cars . Another hit a ' Jersey barrier ' on the New Jersey Turnpike , going 65 m.p.h . " <P> " Your own patients have become the enemy , " writes a third , because they are " the one thing that stands between you and a few hours of sleep . " <P> Agrawal 's organization is supporting the Patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last November by Representative John Conyers Jr . of Michigan . Its key provisions , modeled on New York State 's regulations , include an 80-hour workweek and a 24-hour work-shift limit . <P> Most doctors , however , resist such interference . Dr. Charles Binkley , a senior surgery resident at the University of Michigan , agrees that something needs to be done but believes " doctors should be bound by their conscience , not by the government . " <P> The U.S. controls the hours of pilots and truck drivers . But until such a system is in place for doctors , patients are on their own . If you 're worried about the people treating you or a loved one , you should feel free to ask how many hours of sleep they have had and if more-rested staffers are available . Doctors , for their part , have to give up their pose of infallibility and get the rest they need . <P> Dr. Gupta is a neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent                @ @ @ @ @
