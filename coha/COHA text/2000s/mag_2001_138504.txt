Fall Guys While Michelle Kwan Soared at the figure skating nationals , the men hit the deck // WHEN THE Battle of the Sexes is finally surrendered and women have taken over the planet , anthropologists will look back on the 2001 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Boston as the event that turned the tide , proving beyond question that when the pressure is high , the ladies are mentally tougher and better prepared . With the Salt Lake City Olympics only 13 months away and only two spots available at the world championships in Vancouver in March , America 's finest male skaters put on two pratfall-filled evenings of FleetCenter fun . Pies in the face would not have been out of place . // Leading this merry chase were three men who now have eight U.S. singles titles among them : Tim Goebel ( one ) , Michael Weiss ( two ) and Todd Eldredge ( five ) , all of whom have apparently been sneaking lessons from Michael Richards . Each seemed determined to outslapstick the others . Weiss , the two-time defending champ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freestyle , stepped out of two jumps and failed to land a single combination . It was a performance that would n't have defended the novice title , and he sank to fourth . // Eldredge fared almost as badly . Coming back after a two-year hiatus from Olympic-style competition , the 29-year-old former world champ botched the combination jump in his short program , then doubled four planned triple jumps in the freestyle and tripled a quad . Such a collection of gaffes should have dropped him from contention , but amid this nightmare on Causeway Street it was judged to be the second-best skate of the night . " I 'm just happy I got out alive , " Eldredge said , echoing the sentiment of the 15,173 spectators . // The champion of this Boston Ass-Over-Teakettle Party ? Twenty-year-old Goebel , who won his first U.S. crown despite muffing two landings in his short program and then falling in Saturday afternoon 's freestyle on one of his three quads . The so-called King of Quads  --  Goebel has landed 27 in competition  --  did complete one four-revolution jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , a good batting average in baseball . It 's not exactly the recipe for success in skating , however , especially for Goebel , who has issues in the area of artistry . His posture is hunched , his stroking unsightly , and his spins resemble the last go-rounds of a wobbling corn , and that 's after improving in those areas since switching to Frank Carroll , Michelle Kwan 's coach , last summer . " This was not our best night " Goebel said , " but as Frank tells me at least once a week , ' It 's not the perfect skater who wins , it 's the best one . ' " // That would have been Kwan . The 20-year-old UCLA sophomore survived a bobble early in her free skate to hold off an amazing field of women and win her fifth title in six years . Behind her , Sarah Hughes , 15 , Angela Nikodinov , 20 , Jennifer Kirk , 16 , and Amber Corwin , 22 , all skated brilliantly under pressure . Kwan was still queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges , including seven after her short program , which was as close to a perfect 2:40 of skating as you 'll see . // Unfortunately , on Saturday night , early in her freestyle program , Kwan ratcheted back a planned triple toe  --  triple toe combination into a disappointing double-double . Kwan has done this far too often . While it hardly matters when she skates before a panel of U.S. judges , who value her artistry above all else , Kwan should know that international judges expect more athleticism . Twice already this season she has lost to Russia 's Irina Slutskaya , who lands triple-triple combinations with ease and will stand between Kwan and her first Olympic gold medal . " I 'm pretty disappointed I did n't do the triple-triple , " Kwan said . " I 've been working really hard at it , and it 's been going well in practice , but when it does n't happen , it does n't happen . What can I say ? It 's back to the rink . " // Stand out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the clowns . // High School Sub-Four Webb 's Run for The Ages // On a sultry night last May in Charlotte , Alan Webb failed in his attempt to become the first high school runner in 33 years to break four minutes for the mile . His superb condition was undercut by an uneven pace and the beginnings of a hip injury that would curtail his junior season . Still , he refused to claim even a moral victory from his PR of 4:033 . " I had a goal , and I did n't get it , " Webb said that evening , " but the goal is still out there . " // It is behind him now . Last Saturday at the New Balance Games at the Armory Track &amp; Field Center in New York City , Webb ran 3:59.86 to become the first high school miler to crack the four-minute barrier since Marty Liquori did it in the summer of 1967 . Webb is only the fourth schoolboy runner to break four and the first to do it indoors . // Even more impressive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reston , Va. , was running in his first mile of the year , less than two months after the finish of a cross-country season in which he had finished second at the Foot Locker nationals to the equally precocious Dathan Ritzenhein of Rockford , Mich . " I took two weeks off and then went right back into pretty intense training , " Webb said on Sunday . " I knew this race was a good opportunity to get under four . " // Like Liquori , and Jim Ryun in four of his five sub-fours , Webb benefited from running in an open competition , as opposed to a high school race , in which he would have had to carry the pace . At the Armor , Webb sat behind the leaders through dead-on splits of 59.9 , 1:59.5 and 2:59.9 on the banked , lightning-fast , 200-meter track . " I knew I had it with a quarter left , " said Webb , who finished third , behind Leonard Mucheru , 21 , of Kenya and James Madison grad Matt Holthaus , 29. // Webb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado-bound Ritzenhein in an indoor two-mile in March , but he is pointing toward a busy spring and faster miles . " Four minutes is gone , " said Webb . " Now I want to get into the 3:55 range . I just have to keep running faster . " // Freestyle Skiing Not So Sweet Victory // For the past decade Norway 's Kari Traa was the finest freestyle skier never to win a world or Olympic title . Traa was a respected technician who seemed primed to rule the moguls event if she could muster more speed over the bumps and better extension on her jumps . Last Friday in Whistler , B.C. , after winning her first moguls world championship , Traa , 27 , admitted that she had known the problem all along but could n't stomach the remedy . It is , after all , devilishly hard to fight off a chocolate craving . " I lost some chocolate and lost some pounds , " says Traa , who began cutting back in 1999 and , last winter , after dropping 20 pounds from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second World Cup season title in dual moguls . " Now I 'm moving not so much fat . " // This was no bite-sized habit . There was hot chocolate , baked chocolate , dark chocolate , white chocolate , cookies , cakes , brownies . " Look , some people like whiskey , " says Traa , a bronze medalist at the 1998 Nagano Games . " I like chocolate . I still eat it , but as a reward . " // The restraint has helped propel Traa to the top of the World Cup standings . Asked which form of her favorite confection she would use to celebrate her triumph , Traa wo n't bite . " I ca n't tell you , " she says . " I must guess myself . "
