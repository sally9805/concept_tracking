Headnote No longer tethered to the set of a hit TV show , this country music superstar is steering her career in surprising new directions . An online poll recently ranked country music icon Reba McEntlre somewhere between June Cleaver and Angelina Jolie on a list of America 's favorite celebrity moms . Add this honor to her other achievements-a string of platinum albums , 33 number - one songs , a popular TV sitcom , two books , the role of Annie Oakley in Broadway 's Annie Get Your Gun , and the voice of Betsy the cow in Hollywood 's Charlotte 's Web-and you 've got a snapshot of a diverse career that has spanned three decades . Her key to professional longevity is simple : " You 've got to keep reinventing yourself . " she advises . The girl is everywhere . Never one to rust on her laurels , this month Reba releases her 31st CD and prepares to unveil her latest line of signature clothes , luxury sheets , pillows , and comforters . On the drawing board is a collection of designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reba baseball caps , teddy bears , and key chains are just a keystroke away on her website ( Reba.com ) . Los Angeles remains die center of all this activity , at least until son Shelby , 17 , finishes high school and heads for college eitiier in Texas or Tennessee . Until then , Reba 's concert tours keep her In touch with fans and double as working vacations for the family . Shelby pitches in as part of the road crew and works alongside his dad , Narvel Blackstock , Reba 's husband and manager . They travel widi her to venues that range from glitzy resorts in Atlantic City to down-home state fairs in places like Minot , North Dakota . " We 're a great team , " says Reba . " We 're home for two days and then we go out for ten . There 's so little time ... we cram as much as we can Into every minute of the day . " The Post caught up with Reba on a recent Thursday morning as she was preparing to fly from California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early hour and hectic schedule , she was candid , smart , and witty . Post : Back in 1996 , you held the record for having the most lavish arena tour on the road-40 tons of equipment schlepping across the country in 16 trucks , 7 buses and a jet . Your new show is a lot simpler . What gives ? Is this all part of reinventing yourself ? Reba : Totally . Every year we used to redo our tour , which meant new costumes , lighting , staging , and all sorts of gimmicks . We 've done shows where I 've changed clothes 15 times a night , entered the stage in a taxicab , flown over the arena in an airplane , and risen up through the floor in an elevator . It was amazing , all the stuff we thought of . Our fans loved it , and would come away from a performance saying , " Man , what are they going to do next ? " But after Annie Get Your Gun and after six years of the Reba TV show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to a simpler way of entertaining . Instead of being so busy changing costumes , I wanted to stay out there on stage with the audience and talk to them . So , this tour is more conversational ; it 's telling stories that go along with the songs . Post- Your new album , Reba Duets , pairs you with 11 of country music 's biggest names . One of them , Kelly Clarkson , has become your close friend . She 's 25 , you 're 52 , yet you seem to have a lot in common . What makes your friendship click ? Reba : I do n't know why , but Kelly and I have really hit it off . I first met her after she won American Idol and the show 's producers asked her to name a person she always admired as a singer . She chose me . I was working on the set of the Reba show at the time , and she came over , and we went into a sound studio and rehearsed a song together . That weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song as part of a sort of American Idol finale . Now we hang out together . There 's a group of girls-southern girls like Kelly-here in Los Angeles who all get along really well . They include me , even though I 'm not a young chick anymore . We go out to eat , take vacations together , and just have a wonderful time . Maybe it 's because I 'm from Oklahoma and Kelly and my husband are both from Burleson , Texas ... whatever the reason , we have a blast together . Post : Speaking of Texas , in your TV show you played a single mom raising three kids in Houston . How close was the fictitious Reba Hart to the real Reba McEntire ? Reba : I think Reba Hart became more like Reba McEntire as the series evolved . We used to have discussions as we developed the shows . Someone might ask , " Would Reba Hart do that ? " and I 'd say , " Maybe Reba Hart would , but Reba McEntire definitely would n't because it sends a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those opinions would go into the script . I do n't know if we succeeded in teaching anybody anything , but we were trying to say , " Hey , guys , this is the way you really ought to handle a problem like this . " I remember how much I learned about parenting from watching Andy Griffith and Opie on the old Andy Griffith show . I think when entertainers are in the public eye , they have a responsibility to help people out in normal , everyday situations . Post : As a real-life mom , how would you describe your parenting style ? Are you strict with Shelby ? Reba : I 'm reasonable ... but in a way , I am strict . I think the best lesson Narvel and I have taught Shelby is not to lie . That 's been a rule since he was five years old . Now if Shelby does something wrong , he usually comes to us and says , " Look , this is what I 've done . I messed up , and I wo n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get . So , here are the keys to my car ! " Post : When you were Shelby 's age , you were very athletic - track , basketball , cheerleading , rodeoing . What kind of fitness program do you follow these days ? Reba : I get a good cardio workout onstage . Here at the house I 've got a Piltes machine that Narvel gave me for Christmas . On the road I go to Piltes places , and I do a lot of walking . Staying active mentally and physically is very important . Board games are great ; they make you think . Otherwise you can get real sluggish . As for food , I love to eat ! We just went on a cruise , and I ate to my heart 's content . Luckily it was a French ship , and the portions were small and the food was fresh . After ten days I was afraid I was going to have to wear a muumuu for my shows , but I came back home and had gained only three pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaged foods . Post : In your book Comfort Jrom a Country Quilt , you advise readers to find what they 're best at and then stick with it . Of all the things you 've done professionally , what do you think you are best at ? Reba : Hmmm . I can do a little bit of everything , but I 'm not equally good at it all . For example , I do n't think I 'm a great singer . I 've got 10 or 15 people I could name right now that I think are a lot better singers than I am . Probably the one thing that I 'm good at is portraying the emotion and heartfelt sentiment that the songwriter meant for a song to have . When I sing something that really touches me , it can make people cry . laughs Sometimes I do n't know if my singing is that bad or if it 's just a real sad song . Post : You 've recently put your name on a collection of women 's clothing and a line of decorator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on those products ? Rebcu One-hundred percent . I have a team In New York City that puts together sketches and samples . Then Narvel and I sit down , and I 'll pick out the fabrics , the designs , the trims ... right down to the buttons and lace . When the clothes are made up , they come back to me and I try them on . We develop probably 25 outfits : then I narrow them down to 18 , and we do more fittings . The whole process has so many different stages before we get a final product . Even then I 'm still making notes so we can continue to improve . I read our sales reports and hear comments from our sales associates . I do n't want to be responsible for any product with my name on it that I did n't have total participation in . Post : YouVe always made time for charity work . You 're a spokesperson for Habitat for Humanity , and you raise money for Reba 's Ranch House for families of critically ill patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebca : They have to touch my heart . I have to know that the money goes to where it needs to go . For example . Smile Train is a great organization . I was flabbergasted to learn that every donation goes immediately to children with cleft palates to cover the necessary surgeries . Post : You seem to succeed at everything you do . Just so our readers know that you 've had your share of disappointments , recall for us a failure . Rebca : That 's easy . I always wanted to be the world champion barrel racer in a rodeo , but I was never good enough . I think it was God 's way of saying , " Reba , get off the horses and get back to singing . I gave you the voice , now use it ! " And then there 's songwriting . I try to write songs , but I can never finish them . I have to rely on friends to help me . Again , I think that 's God 's way of saying , " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're supposed to be a team player . " That 's what I love about working with Narvel , my family , my band , and my crew . It 's a team effort , and it keeps me grounded . I ca n't do it all by myself . I 'm not supposed to , and I know it . Sidebar " Habitat for Humanity is a cause that is near and dear to my heart , " says longtime supporter Reba McEnttre , whose Key to the Heart summer concert series benefits Habitat .
