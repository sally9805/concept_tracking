The Motion Picture Association of America has given Team America : World Police an R rating for " graphic , crude and sexual humor , violent images and strong language  --  all involving puppets . " That about sums up the new martial-arts musical marionette movie from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone . Inspired by the ' 60s British TV and movie series Thunderbirds , Parker and Stone have fashioned a naughty , handsome , sporadically funny pre-election recruiting poster for U.S. military values at their most myopically heroic . <P> Team America applies the innocent make-believe of puppets to numbingly real issues : the use of military power to fight insurgent forces and the vision of the U.S. as a superstud nation beset by terrorists abroad and liberal actors at home . It pulls off this brassy trope in the guise of an action movie in the Jerry Bruckheimer mode . Imagine Armageddon starring Pinocchio . <P> The five-member Team America ( whose three males all look like Kurt Russell after being dipped in a tank of Botox ) has noble impulses but lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , the team members inadvertently blow up the Eiffel Tower , the Louvre , the Sphinx and several pyramids . They need a recruit to get inside the terrorist mind , and who better than Gary , a Broadway actor ? While Gary infiltrates the insurgents , North Korea 's kooky dictator , Kim Jong Il , is making worse mischief . He dupes Alec Baldwin and other leftish members of the Film Actors Guild ( FAG , in case you did n't notice ) into being co-hosts of a peace conference in Kim 's palace . Their criminal naivet earns the thesps decapitation , immolation and death by giant felines . <P> Although not up to the sublime level of a typical South Park episode , the film has a fine array of raunchy gags , from a volcano of vomiting to the already notorious sex scene comprising many positions and much anatomically incomplete nudity . Parker , Stone and their marionettes also have fun at their own expense , detailing things puppets ca n't do ( shoot pool , dance , plausibly engage in martial arts ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detail of the production design , by Jim Dultz and David Rockwell . Paris , Cairo , the Panama Canal , the inside of Mount Rushmore and a terrorist hideout ( modeled on the Star Wars cantina ) look fabulous redreamed in miniature . <P> Virtually every Parker production wants to be a musical , and Team America somehow accommodates eight songs that poke fun in the eye of the Broadway-style ballad ( Kim warbles " I 'm So Ronery " ) , the Alan Jackson inspirational anthem ( " Freedom Is n't Free " ) and Bruckheimer 's costliest epic ( " I miss you/ More than Michael Bay missed the mark when he made Pearl Harbor " ) . They keep the smiles coming until the end , when the film goes numbingly nuts and expends all its imagination on ways to kill off people like Helen Hunt and Janeane Garofalo . <P> It 's risky to try reading the minds of Parker and Stone . But having mocked the President in the live-action family sitcom That 's My Bush ! , they seem now to be sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroys countries it wants to save are a lot less bilious than the ones aimed at the lefty actors .
