<p> Even if the National Hockey League cancels its season this week , Sean Avery has a job playing the game . But some of his new opponents resent him . <p> Instead of earning $600,000 as a forward with the Los Angeles Kings of the locked-out N.H.L. , Avery gets $750 a week with the Motor City Mechanics , a last-place expansion team of the salary-capped United Hockey League . <p> He battles for his wages against teams like the Rockford Ice Hogs and the Richmond River Dogs . On Saturday night in a home rink in suburban Detroit called the Garage , Avery made the Muskegon Fury furious . <p> After getting early penalties for high-sticking , unsportsmanlike conduct and fighting , Avery took a double minor in the third period for spearing an opponent in the groin and fighting at length with a defenseman named Jordan Flodell . <p> Before , between and after these incidents , Avery argued frequently on the ice , on the bench and in the penalty box with various members of the Fury . <p> " They said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The implication was that Avery might be taking a job away from veteran minor leaguers who have worked many years at low wages . <p> Avery said he replied by calling his opponents the kind of professional athletes who might replace him next season if the N.H.L. tries to declare an impasse , impose a new collective bargaining agreement and return with replacement players . <p> " I said , ' You guys will probably be in the N.H.L. next year , " ' Avery said . " ' You 'd better watch yourself . " ' Avery paused , glanced downward as if reviewing his own words , then looked up and added , " Maybe I 'd better watch myself . " <p> Avery is one of four N.H.L. players to join the Mechanics this month . The others are forward Bryan Smolinski of Ottawa and two defensemen from the Detroit Red Wings , Derian Hatcher and Chris Chelios . Kris Draper , a Wings forward and a Canadian citizen , is practicing with the Mechanics and seeking visa clearance . <p> Also in the league are Barret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with the Missouri River Otters . Should N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman announce the cancellation of the season , as he has threatened , it is possible that more N.H.L. players will join the U.H.L. , a 14-team circuit located primarily in the Midwest . More than 375 N.H.L. players have found work in Europe . <p> At age 24 , Avery is the youngest of the N.H.L. players on the Mechanics . Chelios , 43 , is the oldest , and he looked weary Saturday night against the Fury . Sunday night 's home game against Port Huron was to be his third in three nights , and he said he was planning to talk with team management about his workload . <p> " Playing 30 or 35 minutes a game is something that really takes away from your game , " Chelios said . " I want to help out and make it fun for everybody , but not try to kill myself doing it . " <p> Hatcher grew up near the arena in Fraser and said he and his friends rented ice time here at midnight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . The souvenir stand in the Garage is called the Tool Box , and the refreshment stand is the Lunch Box . <p> The franchise is owned by Walter Cohen , a local real estate developer who said it was good for business to hire the major leaguers , even if it put his team over the $260,000 salary cap for the season . <p> Each dollar over that figure forces the team to pay a $2 tax to the league . But the Mechanics were last in league attendance , with an average of 1,601 going into the weekend . They drew 2,093 on Saturday  --  tickets cost $8 to $25  --  while losing to Muskegon , 3-1 . <p> Hatcher said fan reaction had been mixed on the road . " Some boo at us and some yell at us , but they are selling out , " he said . <p> Steve Shannon , the Mechanics ' coach , said Hatcher was so besieged by autograph seekers in Port Huron on Friday night that it was like trying to get Paul McCartney to the limousine after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in five years . <p> Hatcher , Cohen and several others associated with the team said no previous Mechanics players would lose salary because of the new arrivals . " That was one of the conditions , " said Hatcher , who is sensitive about putting other players out of work . <p> But some have lost ice time and others have lost roster spots while remaining on the payroll . <p> Chelios is not overly sensitive on this point . " It 's the nature of the game that there is always someone to take your spot , " he said . " If it 's not us , it 's a young guy . It 's no different than us going to Europe or Europeans coming here . " <p> Smolinski and Hatcher are both 32 , and the two said it hurt to get back into shape against players in midseason condition . Hatcher had several ice bags on his body after Saturday 's game , and Smolinski said " all my aches and pains came back . " <p> The salary cap in the U.H.L . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The N.H.L. Players ' Association 's resistance to a cap is a big issue . <p> Hatcher was asked about reports over the weekend that union members were putting pressure on their executive director , Bob Goodenow , to accept a cap and save the season . <p> " I do n't get the feeling Bob is under a lot of pressure , " Hatcher said . " I 'm sticking with the union . " Hatcher said he found it revealing that Bettman had not canceled the season despite his threats . <p> " There must be a reason , " Hatcher said . " They 're still looking at something to happen . " <p> Avery said his vision of a solution was for Bettman to be fired , then for player representatives to get in a room with all 30 owners , not just those viewed as hard-liners who are Bettman 's biggest supporters . <p> " Good faith would come to the table , " Avery said . <p> Before the lockout , Chelios had tentatively agreed to a $2.2 million contract with Detroit for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Hall of Fame career . He was the United States ' captain in two Olympics . He said he had called Goodenow " to question him , because the bottom line is the guys want to play . " <p> Chelios is one of the sport 's most influential personalities . During the 103-day lockout of 1994-95 , he was chastised for making vaguely menacing remarks about Bettman 's well-being . Chelios said he had also taken calls from Red Wings executives . <p> " They sniff around and try to figure out what we 're thinking , if we 're behind Bob or not , " Chelios said . The players " have made it clear , " Chelios said , that they will not settle for a salary cap or a link between salary and revenue . <p> " It 's just a rotten deal they are offering us , " Chelios said . " Sometimes life is n't fair . We 're going to try to fight this . " He maintains a bit of optimism . " I really do n't see how they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bettman and the owners . " I can see them push it right to the edge and get as much as they possibly can . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Derian Hatcher and Chris Chelios on a minor league bench .
