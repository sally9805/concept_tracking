It 's not easy moving through the world when you 're terrified of electricity . " Donna , " 45 , a writer , knows that better than most . Get her in the vicinity of an appliance or a light switch or  --  all but unthinkable  --  a thunderstorm , and she is overcome by a terror so blinding she can think of nothing but fleeing . That , of course , is not always possible , so over time , Donna has come up with other answers . When she opens the refrigerator door , rubber-soled shoes are a must . If a light bulb blows , she will tolerate the dark until someone else changes it for her . Clothes shopping is done only when necessary , lest static on garments send her running from the store . And swimming at night is absolutely out of the question , lest underwater lights electrocute her . When there 's a possibility that lightning may strike , she simply shuts off everything in her house and sits alone in a darkened room until the danger passes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for Donna 's very extreme condition : electrophobia , or a morbid fear of electricity . You will find it listed right below eisoptrophobia ( fear of mirrors ) and not far above enetophobia , eosophobia and ereuthrophobia ( fear of pins , daylight and blushing , respectively ) . And those are just some of the Es . <P> For every phobia the infinitely inventive  --  and infinitely fearful  --  human mind can create , there is a word that has been coined to describe it . There 's nephophobia , or fear of clouds , and coulrophobia , the fear of clowns . There 's kathisophobia , fear of sitting , and kyphophobia , fear of stooping . There are xanthophobia , leukophobia and chromophobia , fear of yellow , white and colors in general . There are alektorophobia and apiphobia , fear of chickens and bees . And deep in the list , lost in the Ls , there 's lutraphobia , or fear of otters  --  a fear that 's useful , it would seem , only if you happen to be a mollusk . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now , of course , collected online
