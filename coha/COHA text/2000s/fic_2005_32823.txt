Chapter One : Terror at 12,000 Feet I 'm going to die . That 's what I thought when I pulled the cord of my parachute  --  and nothing happened . Definitely not cool . As I plummeted downward through the sky , it felt like I was floating . The earth below , on the other hand , was rushing up to greet me at a speed of 120 miles per hour . To make matters worse , it was my first solo jump . And probably my last . I tried not to panic . I looked over at " Wings " Maletta , the jumpmaster of Freedombird Skydiving School . The big bearded man was Freedom-falling about ten yards away from me . I waved to him like a maniac , pointing at my broken parachute cord . And guess what he did ? He laughed . Seriously . Like some sort of cartoon villain on Saturday morning TV , he threw his oversized head back and laughed . Then it hit me . He knows who I am . In case you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps out of planes . I 'm Joe Hardy  --  undercover agent for ATAC ( American Teens Against Crime )  --  and I was on a mission . A pretty dangerous mission , as it turned out . The police had reason to believe that the Freedombird Skydiving School was just a front for a fly-by-night smuggling ring . Wings Maletta was n't a real diving instructor  --  he was a DVD pirate . So the ATAC team asked my brother Frank and me to go undercover to crack the case . Hey , why not ? Who would suspect a couple of teenage boys taking skydiving lessons ? Wings Maletta , that 's who . I stared at the broken pull cord in my hand and the big-toothed grin on Wings 's round furry face . He looked right at me  --  then pointed up at the plane . My brother Frank stood in the open doorway , getting ready to jump . " Frank ! Wait ! Do n't jump ! " I shouted through the walkie-talkie in my helmet . Too late . Frank leaped out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I yelled . " Maletta cut the pull cords ! " I waited for a response . Nothing . " Frank ! Can you read me ? " Static . I did n't know what to think . Did Frank hear me ? Did someone sabotage his parachute too ? One thing I did know . If I did n't grab onto Wings Maletta in the next few seconds , I was going to be digging really deep for clams in the sandy beach below . And I hated clams . So I angled my body headfirst toward the dude who wanted to kill me  --  and tried to " swim " after him . Hey , it works in the movies . But this was n't a movie . This was real life , and I did n't have a stunt double . I did n't even get five feet before a wicked blast of air sent me spinning off course . I quickly straightened my arms into a diving position and managed to catch a " wave " of wind . Before I knew it , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body surfing , except I was swallowing mouthfuls of air instead of water . And , oh yeah , my life depended on it . Like a human rocket , I zeroed in on Wings Maletta and  --  pow  --  the guy did n't even know what hit him . I plowed into his bulging beer belly with a soft thud . Then , throwing my arms around his barrel chest , I held on tight . Wings was totally stunned . You should have seen his face . With his eyes bulging in his goggles and his furry beard poking out of his helmet , he looked like a very large  --  and very confused  --  teddy bear . Except teddy bears do n't usually throw punches when kids hug them . Whack ! Wings 's huge hairy fist slammed into my jaw and sent me flying backward . Man ! That hurt ! It was still daylight , but I was seeing stars . And clouds . And the earth , too  --  spinning around me . Time to get a grip . I spread out my arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for his parachute cord . Oh , great . If I did n't grab onto him in the next second or two , I was going to plunge to my death . Not an option . So I bucked against the wind like a wild bronco and thrust myself headfirst at Wings . With all my strength I lunged at him with my right arm . Somehow I managed to grab his wrist  --  before he could pull the cord . All right ! But Wings was n't having it . He tried to brush me off like a bug , smacking my hand and swatting me away . I reeled back from his blows . Then my hand started to slip off his wrist . One inch . And another . Get a grip , I told myself again . But this time I meant it . Literally . Suddenly the walkie-talkie in my helmet crackled with sound . " Joe ! Hold tight ! " It was Frank ! I glanced up . There he was ! Swooping down like a bomber plane ! I grabbed onto Wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bull's-eye . Frank crashed into us with shocking force . The collision sent the three of us tumbling through the air like a clumsy circus act . Frank clung on piggyback-style while I swung from my arms . And Wings ? He kicked and screamed with every twist and turn . " Get off me , you brats ! " he howled . " The chute wo n't hold us all ! " I pulled myself up until we stopped spinning . But Wings would n't stop yelling . " You idiots ! " he bellowed . " When I pull the cord , you 'll be flung off ! You do n't stand a chance ! " " Oh , no ? " Frank shouted back . He held up a pair of tandem cords and clipped both of us to Wings 's backpack . I had to hand it to Frank . That kid is always prepared . Wings let out a sigh . " We 're still too heavy , " he shouted . " Just pull the cord , " I said . Wings shrugged  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank and I were ripped away from our bear-sized enemy . We plummeted downward , then shot back up again , held by the tandem cords . The parachute opened above our heads , but it sagged with our weight . In seconds we were drifting toward the drop zone below . Problem was , we were drifting too fast . " I told you , " Wings grunted . " At this speed , we 'll all die ! " Frank and I ignored him as we scrambled up the cords and grabbed onto Wings 's legs . " Let go ! " the phony instructor yelled , trying to kick us off . " One of you has to let go  --  if you want to save your brother ! " he added . I looked Frank in the eye . I knew what he was thinking : No way . We 're a team . " I have another idea , Wings , " I said , shimmying my way up the guy 's body . " Maybe you can break our fall . " Wings cursed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached down to help my brother until we were both standing on Wing 's shoulders , holding the parachute lines for support . " But wait ! The fall could kill me ! " Wings protested as we floated swiftly to the field below . " I 'll break my legs , for sure ! " I glanced at my brother and shrugged . " That 's a risk we 're willing to take , " Frank said with a smile . The earth was only a couple hundred feet below us . Wings was freaking out . " No ! My legs ! I 'll be crushed ! " " I have a suggestion , Wings , " I said . " What 's that ? " " Tuck and roll . " As it turned out , Wings did break his legs in the fall . Which made it impossible for him to run away when the police arrived . They 'd been watching the whole thing from the ground  --  and had an ambulance waiting to pick up the pieces . I was just happy that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good job , boys , " said Lieutenant Jones , smiling and shaking our hands . " Sorry we got here a little late . By the time we realized your cover was blown , you were already in the air with Maletta . " " I ca n't believe that guy actually tried to kill us , " Frank said , shaking his head . " Well , he is a pirate , " I pointed out . " A DVD pirate , " Frank added . " It 's like he made us walk the plank for a bootleg copy of Spider-man 6 . " I laughed . " Hey , we survived , " I said , punching his arm . Frank returned the favor by pushing me off-balance . " You boys need a lift back to the skydiving school ? " Lieutenant Jones asked , opening the door of his squad car . " No , thanks . We 're undercover , " Frank explained . " Some kids from our school showed up for diving lessons today . " The police officer nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the Freedombird Skydiving School . We were totally beat , not to mention a little bruised . But it felt good to complete another successful mission . Wings and his smuggling ring were safely behind bars . And the Hardy brothers were ready to relax and chill out with some friends . Unfortunately , Brian Conrad was the last " friend " we wanted to see  --  and the first person to spot us approaching the Freedombird School . " Why did Brian have to show up for lessons today ? " I moaned to my brother . " Talk about a bad coincidence . " " More like Murphy 's Law , " Frank chipped in . " Hey , Hardys ! " our least favorite classmate yelled from the parking lot . " I saw you jump . What 's up with the double tandem diving ? You girls get scared , or what ? " I glanced at Frank and rolled my eyes . Let me tell you about Brian Conrad . The guy is like that public access TV  --  nothing but bad news , twenty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most Likely to Need a Good Lawyer , he 'd win , hands down . Of course , he hated Frank and me . In case you had n't noticed . " Too scared to go solo , huh ? " Brian taunted as we approached the school building . I growled under my breath . " Ignore him , Joe , " my brother whispered . Then Frank looked Brian in the eye and said , " Our parachutes malfunctioned , Conrad . We almost died . " " Yeah ? I almost believe you , " Brian shot back . He leaned against his SUV and shouted to his sister in the backseat . " You hear that , Belinda ? Your boyfriends are too scared to jump solo ! What a pair of wimps ! " Belinda glared at her brother . She opened her mouth to say something  --  but she was interrupted by a high-pitched voice inside the school building . " Wimps ! Wimps ! Wimps ! " Brian Conrad burst out laughing . Frank and I turned toward the small brick building and exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . The police had rounded up all of Wings 's men . So we headed for the door and carefully peeked inside . " Wimps ! " The sound came from a large gold cage in the corner . It was Wings 's pet parrot  --  the official mascot of the Freedombird Skydiving School . " Figures , " I muttered . " The pirate had a parrot . " Frank entered the small reception room and walked to the cage . " Poor thing , " he cooed to the red and green bird . " Your daddy 's behind bars now . Just like you . " The parrot tilted its head as if it understood . " Maybe we should set you free . " Frank opened the cage door and the bird flew out . I ducked as it fluttered past my head . " Easy there , flyboy , " I said . The parrot circled the room a few times  --  and landed on Frank 's head . " Looks like you have a new friend , Frank , " I said . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Brian Conrad walked in . " What do we have here ? " the jerk sneered . " One parrot and a pair of chickens ! " He pointed and laughed . Okay , stay cool , I told myself . If my brother and I could survive a parachute jump without pull cords , we could put up with Conrad 's obnoxious jokes . But come on . Did the bird have to join in , too ? " Chickens ! Chickens ! Chickens ! "
