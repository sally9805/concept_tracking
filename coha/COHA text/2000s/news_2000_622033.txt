<p> On the outskirts of this booming metropolis , where skyscrapers and industrial parks and freeways march toward the horizon , there is a grand vision of China 's future , and it looks a lot like Los Angeles . <p> Some call it prosperity , some call it nightmare . <p> Whatever it is , it involves lots of automobiles . <p> One of the most little-noticed yet potentially far-reaching effects of China 's expected entry into the World Trade Organization is likely to be a sharp expansion in car ownership among the nation 's 1.3 billion people . <p> In China , autos remain relatively few , and bicycles still rule the road in many places . But the prospect of a quantum leap in car ownership is exciting consumers and stirring debate among Chinese authorities about its possible impact . <p> In the United States , which long ago embraced the auto as way of life , the prospect of China joining the club has prompted alarm from environmentalists , who say the WTO deal could worsen China 's horrendous pollution levels and contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mark a historic switch to car culture for China . <p> Under the WTO terms negotiated last November by U.S. and Chinese diplomats , China 's import tariffs on autos will drop from 80-100 percent to 25 percent , and foreign automakers will be allowed to both set up full-service operations ( currently they are limited to sales only ) and make car loans . <p> It is this last concession that may count most . <p> In the United States , about 85 percent of all cars are sold on credit , but in China the government channels nearly all credit to state industries and leaves almost none for consumer loans  --  a legacy of Marxist-Leninist resource policies that emphasized building up heavy industry and the military . As a result , most Chinese cars are owned by companies or the state bureaucracy , not individuals . <p> For many Chinese , the WTO will mean a new way of life . <p> " We are starting a trend , common in Western countries , for rich people to move out of downtown , buy a car and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top Shanghai city official . <p> " In the future , it will be common for people to drive 60 miles to work , just like in California . " <p> This evolution to auto-based transportation , Zang admitted , could ruin Shanghai 's urban plan , which has tried to balance mass transit and automobiles . <p> In the past decade , Shanghai has become a futuristic showcase for Chinese planners . The once-rural Pudong area , across the Huangpu River from downtown , is now covered by miles and miles of skyscrapers , industrial parks , broad boulevards and freeways . The area is home to 1.5 million of the city 's population of 13 million , up from virtually zero a decade ago , and is scheduled to grow to more than 6 million by 2010 . <p> Eleven brand-new " satellite cities , " a recently opened airport , two metro lines with nine more planned  --  as well as hundreds of miles of new freeway with hundreds more on the way  --  all testify to what foreign experts call a model for how to manage China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new highways may be insufficient , and more may have to be built . <p> " Our plans have not taken into account the WTO terms , and we may have to revise them , " he said . " But that is not a problem . " <p> Many officials argue that it is indeed a big challenge , one that requires more government attention . <p> " No one will be able to stop the increase in private auto ownership " under WTO membership , said Li Bingdi , vice president of the Chinese Academy of Urban Planning and Design , a Beijing-based government agency . <p> " In cities , it will have a big impact on the environment . There is a serious debate in China . Many of us think that instead , auto ownership should be limited and mass transit should be prioritized . " <p> A major player in the internal debate is China 's powerful auto lobby . <p> Auto manufacturing is officially designated one of the nation 's four " pillar " industries , to be defended at all costs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if stiffer pollution controls are adopted under the WTO regime , foreign firms will have a major competitive advantage thanks to their long experience with the issue  --  and will drive domestic ones into bankruptcy . <p> To be sure , China still has a long way to go before it approaches the auto saturation level of the United States . Shanghai , with a population of 13 million , only has 600,000 vehicles . Los Angeles County , in comparison , has 6.3 million registered vehicles for its 9.2 million people . <p> There are no projections available for post-WTO auto sales , and foreign auto firms are hesitant to talk about the subject for fear of arousing Chinese opposition . <p> Scott Reno , who opened General Motors ' auto loan department in Shanghai last year in anticipation of the WTO move , said the extent of the sales boom depends on how the Chinese government implements the complex financial fine print in the WTO 's provision on auto loans . <p> " The devil is in the details , but ( WTO membership ) certainly will spur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to worsen China 's air pollution , which is as thick as pea soup and among the world 's worst . In the 1980s and 1990s , the government pursued a growth-at-all-costs strategy , allowing pollution levels in major cities to rise to global records . <p> Since 1996 , however , when the government formally embraced environmental protection , it has pulled out the stops in its propaganda machine to rally the public behind the new goal . Billboards are everywhere on urban streets and rural highways across the nation , advocating forest protection , water cleanup , recycling and nearly every imaginable " green " activity . <p> Domestic and foreign environmentalists have praised government actions such as these : <p>  --  Pollution-generating factories were moved out of inner cities . <p>  --  All automakers were forced to install fuel injection and catalytic converters in new cars . <p>  --  Leaded gasoline has been banned in 50 cities . A nationwide ban takes effect July 1 . <p>  --  The so-called Euro 1 vehicle emissions standard has been adopted . It is equivalent to U.S. standards established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II standard , equivalent to U.S. standards of the early ' 90s . <p> But most of the recent gains have been erased by the sheer impact of tens of millions of Chinese joining the middle class as a result of the economic boom . Car ownership has grown by 15 percent annually in recent years . <p> " Just when they were getting a handle on industrial and residential pollution , the number of vehicles has started to really expand , so air quality has gotten better  --  but not by much , even though they 're working like crazy to improve it , " said Todd Johnson , an environmental economist at the World Bank . <p> Some U.S. environmental groups say that in drawing up the WTO agreement , American diplomats ignored green issues . <p> They note that in the long negotiations prior to November 's accord , U.S. officials held out for the auto loan concession  --  and treated it as a deal-breaker . A tentative agreement in April 1999 was rejected by President Clinton partly because it did not include the provision . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate the transfer of pollution control expertise , technology to control chlorofluorocarbons and other environmental issues , " said Brent Blackwelder , president of Friends of the Earth . <p> " China has many people who are seriously concerned about the levels of pollution , which are grim almost beyond fathoming . Instead , we 're helping them buy cars . " <p> Other experts say the WTO deal 's slighting of environmental issues also misses a highly profitable opportunity for America 's  --  and especially California 's  --  tech firms . <p> " California 's environmental and energy technology industries are the world leaders , and it 's in our interest across the board to speed the adoption of this technology in China , " said Hal Harvey , president of the Energy Foundation , a San Francisco group working with Chinese officials and scientists on energy-efficient techniques . <p> He noted that the only U.S. car models sold in China are large , fuel-guzzling sedans and sport utility vehicles , rather than smaller , more environmentally friendly cars . <p> " Trade could help the Chinese environment , slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomats just have n't understood that yet , " Harvey said . <p> He praised a recent initiative by the California Energy Commission and the U.S. Energy Department to share technologies with Chinese officials , calling it a useful first step . <p> However , Harvey and other experts caution that to clean up the country 's environmental mess , the Chinese need political will  --  and lots of money  --  as much as high-tech devices . <p> Although vehicles are the main source of air pollution in Chinese cities and the fastest-growing source nationwide , coal-burning industries account for the largest portion . <p> Refitting these industries with green technology would send a strong signal that the government intends to back up its environmentalist rhetoric with hard cash . <p> Some experts doubt that will happen anytime soon . Environmental officials in Beijing said last month that merely to bring the largest Chinese cities ' air quality standards up to U.S. levels of the mid-1980s would cost $40 billion .
