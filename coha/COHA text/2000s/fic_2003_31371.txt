Graham Keep , English West March , England , 1542 Lord Ridley Graham searched Graham Keep for his stepmother , growing increasingly frustrated at his fruitless efforts . She was supposed to be watched at all times , but the man he 'd set on her had only trembled and whispered that she 'd escaped him hours ago and he 'd yet to locate her . She was making this too difficult . He 'd finally managed to rid himself of his brother and sisters , however temporarily . He 'd hoped that without their interference he could finally convince Mona that she truly was better off with him . Stepmother . He nearly sneered at the thought . She was five years younger than his three and thirty and the most exquisite creature he 'd ever laid eyes on . He 'd never accepted her as his stepmother . Ridley had found her first . He 'd wanted her first . But his father had staked his claim , and like everything else , Ridley had been powerless to do aught but stand aside and watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless . He stepped into the cook 's garden , the sight of Mona settling his agitated soul . He stood back , wanting only to watch her for now . She 'd always shunned the finery Hugh Graham had tried to bestow on her . Even now , when she should be in mourning , she disdained Hugh still . Ridley loved her for it . She wore a dun-colored kirtle smudged with green stains and a forest bodice . The long , creamy sleeves of her shift were rolled to the elbow , and her fine hands encased in leather gloves as she dug industriously in the garden . Her hair , a silken ebony so dark it shone nearlyblue in candlelight , was piled on top of her head , fat curls spilling down to nuzzle her cheeks and nestle against her neck . Ridley longed to run a hand over the smooth soft skin of her nape . It called to him and he stepped forward . But he stopped , hands clasped hard behind his back . She would not welcome his touch . She never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried very hard . Part of him wanted to blame it on his father . Hugh had ruined her for all men with his violent lusts . But he knew that was n't entirely true , for even before Hugh had met Mona , she 'd rejected Ridley . And she did not fear his displeasure  --  in spite of all Hugh had put her through . She had the heart of a lion and yet she was nothing . A commoner , a widow , a healer . Ridley had lifted her out of her common life and tried to give her something better , and she resented him for it . He was young , handsome , and a lord . Why could she not return his love ? He 'd given her everything , with promises of more . He worshipped her , treated her like a queen . How could she reject such a life ? A life sought after by the daughters of lords , dreamed of by lesser women . As he watched her , she seemed to sense his growing enmity . She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deep water at midnight . The long black lashes that framed her eyes made her look innocent , a startled doe , not fully aware of the danger he posed . Her full pink lips tightened imperceptibly . Most would n't notice , she guarded her feelings so well , but Ridley had studied her for many years , openly and covertly . Hiding in her chambers to see her naked body . Following her wherever she went . He knew every expression , every blemish , every scar on her body intimately , and yet her heart was closed to him . She did n't rise as respect demanded . Instead , she rubbed her gloves together . Dirt sprinkled to the ground . She removed the gloves methodically , still kneeling in the dirt and herbs , and laid them purposely on her lap . " What is it , Ridley ? " she asked , not looking at him . She caressed the leaf of a plant with her bare fingers . He would give anything for her to touch him in such a manner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile for some reaction , but her eyes never left the plant . Her nose was small and straight , her delicate features ethereal in their beauty . " How is tending my herbs considered hiding ? " She stood and faced him . The air was chill but she wore no cloak . The odd beads she wore about her neck peeped out from the embroidered neckline of her shift . They were important to her , these beads . They belonged to someone she once cared for a great deal . Ridley hated them , wished he could destroy them . But he was n't a fool . She 'd not just disdain him then , she 'd hate him . She was n't far from hate now , he feared . She loved Ridley 's brother and sisters deeply . She 'd tried to mother them all after being forced to marry their father  --  and she 'd succeeded with Caroline , Wesley , and Fayth . She 'd even tried to befriend Ridley . But Ridley had n't wanted her friendship  --  not unless it came with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorned the scraps she 'd thrown him , and so she 'd stopped trying . " You 're angry at me , " he said . " What you 're doing is wrong . " She tried to walk past him , into the keep , but he caught her arm , reveling in the feel of her soft flesh beneath his hand . This close he could smell her hair . Rosewater . The faint scent of herbs clung to her clothes . Even in the weak sunlight her hair shone like a polished stone . He touched a curl that nestled against her neck , letting it twine about his finger . " Leave off , Ridley . " She always said that . She always denied him what should be his right . His father had taken it from him . But Hugh was gone and she should be his . He refused to release her . They were alone . The servants knew better than to disturb him when he was with his stepmother . Only his siblings dared , under some mistaken idea they were protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would never harm her , would never allow anyone else to harm her . He loved her . Why could no one see that ? Understand it ? " I thought you agreed with my decision to marry Caroline to Lord Annan . " She 'd been the only one who had . It had been an ugly time at Graham Keep . The Eden Grahams had been in a blood feud with the Annan Maxwells for centuries  --  since the disappearance of a disputed family jewel , the Clachan Fala . Hugh Graham had kept the feud thriving in his lifetime . But when Hugh passed on , Ridley proposed a peace to the new laird , Robert Maxwell . They sealed the peace with a marriage , Ridley 's sister Caroline to Lord Annan . Caroline had been opposed ; she 'd always planned to enter a convent . Fayth and Wesley had fought him as well for defying Father 's wishes . But Ridley was their lord and his will was done . Mona 's lush black lashes rose until she pinned him with an accusing stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness with Lord Annan . But I do n't agree with your reasons . You care nothing for Caroline 's happiness or peace . You only want one thing . " She was not entirely wrong . It was true he 'd not married off his sister for peace . He 'd married her because according to legend , it was a condition that must be met . A Graham of the Eden grayne must wed a Maxwell of the Annan grayne . Only then would the Keeper bring the Bloodstone forth . And like his father before him , Ridley believed Mona was the Keeper . But the Clachan Fala was not the only thing he wanted . " You 're wrong , " he said , pulling her in front of him and placing his hands firmly on her shoulders . " I want you . " " I am your stepmother . What you propose is a sin . " It was the same response she always tossed at him . Meaningless . " My father forced you to marry him . You never loved him , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that was God 's judgement on the union . It was wrong . " He pulled her closer , forcing her against him , pressing his cheek against her fragrant hair . " What we could have is right . God would bless us with many strong children . " " Bastards , you mean . You can not wed me . " " I would defy the king and the church if you would have me . " She planted her palms firmly against his chest and pushed , putting a few inches between them . " I am a widow and I mean to remain one . Forever . " Her mouth was set in a firm line , but it was still beautiful and he wanted to kiss her . He lowered his head , halting when she grabbed his ear and twisted . He released her abruptly and stepped back , yanking his throbbing ear from her fingers . He scowled down at her , but her sternness disappeared . " Ridley , I beseech you , let me go . I can not help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She took a step toward him , palms out in supplication . " Be the brother I know you could be . It 's hidden somewhere in your heart . Do not force Fayth to wed Lord Carlisle , he will abuse her . She will never be the same . " " Good ! " Ridley 's youngest sister was the most unruly , contentious little harridan ever born  --  and Father had adored her . Ridley hated her for that alone . Mona shook her head emphatically . " No , not good ! You already hurt her heart by forcing her to deceive her sister  --  and the reward you promise is naught but a castle in the air . " Ridley grabbed his stepmother and shook her . " Did you tell her this ? " Too much of his plans rested on Fayth trusting him and doing her job . If she even suspected Ridley had lied to her , it could ruin everything . " I tried , but she wants to believe you . I want to believe you . " The disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will honor my promise if you give me the Clachan Fala . I will let her marry the stable boy if that 's her fancy . It 's within your power to make that happen . " She shook her head , averting her eyes as if she could n't bear the sight of him . " I have no power . I wish you could understand that . " She had more power over him than she knew , more than he would ever admit to her . If she had shown him a shred of the love he felt for her , he 'd fall at her feet and give her anything she wanted . But she could n't even do that . " When Hugh died , I promised to take care of his children  --  that was the last thing he asked of me . " She met Ridley 's gaze again . " And that includes you . I want nothing more than your happiness . Fayth 's happiness . Caroline and Wesley 's happiness . " Her hands came up to grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek . The Clachan Fala will not bring you happiness . It will not fill the hole inside you . Only you can fill it , through kindness to others . " " I have always been kind to you . " She rolled her eyes and spun away from him . He let her go . " No , what you show me is not kindness . It is obsession . Manipulation . It is selfish . " He could n't argue that . He 'd first discovered her seven years ago . Hugh had always had a keen interest in the legend of the Clachan Fala . He loathed the Annan Maxwells  --  especially the then-laird , Red Rowan . He 'd wanted to find the Bloodstone and flaunt it in his enemy 's face . He 'd been collecting tales over the years , which had led them to a small village that the Keeper was said to frequent . Hugh had sent Ridley to investigate . It had been Ridley 's lucky day . He 'd only had to ask a few people before he was directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baker 's daughter . There had been women before Mona , but none after . She was all he wanted . He 'd tried to court her , but she 'd wanted nothing to do with him . He 'd finally taken her to Hugh . It had shocked no one more than Ridley when Hugh raped her and forced her to the altar . And he had n't even loved her . All he 'd wanted was the Clachan Fala , and he 'd believed that as his wife she would eventually give it to him . Ridley had never loved his father , but Hugh had lost his respect that day . Seven years later , his feelings for Mona had only grown . And now she was free and he was Lord Graham . And still it changed nothing . This time , when she passed him , he let her go . He stared blankly at the herb garden for a long while , his mind filled with thoughts of Mona , thoughts of the Bloodstone . She was wrong , it could bring him happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed it . He would be fearless and undefeated in battle . He would be honored by the king and grow rich in lands and titles . Then she would not refuse him . He would keep her as his mistress  --  refuse to marry her as punishment for her rejection . It was slow in coming , but his calm was finally restored . Someone cleared his throat behind him , and Ridley turned . The man he 'd set on Mona stood beside him , wringing his hands , sweating in the cold . " M-my lord ? I found her . She 's in her chambers . " " Really ? " The man 's head bobbed hopefully . " You 're removed from that duty . I will find someone more competent . " The man 's face paled , his eyes filling with tears . What a weak piece of dung . " I have a new task for you . " Ridley turned to the herb garden and gestured to it . " Rip up all the plants and trample them . " Escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman alone would never survive where she must journey . She needed protection . She needed a man . The irony was not wasted on Mona . She prided herself on being needed  --  not needful , and certainly never needful of a man . But this was an extraordinary circumstance and it called for unusual  --  and perhaps repellent  --  tactics . She toyed with the beads around her neck , her mind turning back to the enormous Scotsman rotting in the bowels of Graham Keep . Sir Patrick Maxwell . He was a great knight , she 'd been told . She 'd visited him on a few occasions , to assess him . He seemed worthy enough . But Ridley had set a new spy on her , and he was more diligent than the last . Mona left her chambers . She passed the empty chambers of her stepchildren , and her heart ached . How she missed them . She 'd come to them seven years ago , one and twenty and fresh from the loss of her own mother figure . She 'd needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they were gone . She would see Caroline again , of that she was certain , but she might never again see Fayth and Wesley , and it broke her heart . Mona hurried on to the highest point in the castle , a high turret , and waited until she saw Ridley ride through the gates with a host of men . Gone to work off his aggression . Just like his father , though both men would be loath to admit it . It was why Hugh had despised his son . He 'd believed that Ridley contained all his faults and none of his virtues . Her heart ached for the poor boy deprived of his father 's love . Hugh had been wrong about his son , but it was too late to change anything . Hugh was dead , and Ridley refused the comfort of friendship . Mona strode back to her own chambers and retrieved a key , hoping she would n't need it . Let the prisoner be honorable . Hidden beneath a floorboard with the key were a clean set of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a blanket , and a book . She placed them in a canvas sack and threw on her hooded cloak . The new man followed her , but no more skillfully than the last . She lost him in the kitchens and took the secret ways through the castle until she reached the entrance to the dungeons . She waited in the shadows until she was certain her new shadow was truly gone . A man-at-arms guarded the door , alert , lance held at his side . Mona stepped out of the shadows . " Greetings , Ned . " " Good evening , my lady , " Ned said , bowing and blushing beneath the shag of his dark beard . " ' Ere to see the prisoner again ? " " Yes , may I ? " She always asked , though she knew he would n't refuse her . His wife was pregnant now after years of a barren womb , and Ned attributed it solely to a philter Mona had given them to partake of together . He felt he owed her a great debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she knew that for a lie , even if he did n't . His gratitude had limits . He might let her see the prisoner , but he would not aid her in releasing him . He opened the door . As she passed him , she placed a hand on his sleeve . " You 'll tell no one I was here ? " " On my honor . " Mona descended the stone steps . Torches placed at intervals lighted the stairs . Mona removed the bottom torch and took it to the nearest cell , fitting it in the sconce beside the door . Sir Patrick was currently the sole prisoner in the dungeons . Others came and went , but he remained . As she expected , by the time she turned , the Scotsman 's dirty bearded face was pressed to the bars . " You again , " he said , his voice cracking and raw . " Why do ye keep coming ? " " I brought you this . " She held up the sack . The eyes narrowed , their color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a gemstone . Misty as a morning sky . The eyes of an angel . The kind of eyes Arlana had always warned her about . " He 's different , " Mona assured her mentor , long dead now , but always with her in memory . " Who 's different ? " the prisoner demanded . His beautiful eyes were at such odds with his face  --  masked by a wild curling beard that must have once been blond but was now brown with filth . If he proved to be the one , she would have to clean him up . Mona flushed , embarrassed she had spoken aloud and glad for the hooded cloak that shadowed her face . " There is food in here and a book  --  are you lettered ? " " Why do you keep bringing me things ? " he growled , ignoring her question . He was very suspicious , though she knew that if she turned to leave , he would beg her to return and be very civil . He was always like this in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from you . " " Oh , aye ? " He cocked a brow wickedly . " Sir Patrick Maxwell , " she said sternly , attempting to remind him of who he was and his place in the world . His knightly title impacted him not at all  --  the lascivious gleam did n't disappear . " I need a lock of your hair . " He frowned . " My hair ? " " And nail parings , too , if you please . " " What ? Why ? " His big fists released the bars as he stepped back , receding into the darkness of his cell . She could no longer see his face through the bars . No doubt he considered her the worst of witches and thought she meant to cast a spell on him . Well , there was no help for it . She did not intend to explain herself . If he did indeed prove to be the one , she would reveal much to him . But she would n't know until she got his hair and nails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , holding them up for his inspection . " I brought many things to ease you . " He still did n't return to the bars . She replaced the items in the sack . " If you come to the door , I will cut your hair and nails , then pass the sack to you . " There was a long silence , then he said , " If you want my hair , lassie , you 'll have to come and get it . " So he would make a game of this ? She tried not be annoyed . He 'd been a prisoner of the Grahams for nearly a year and kept in the dungeon for six months of it . He was bored and angry . And yet something told her he could not hurt her . Still , this was nothing more than a bid for freedom . " I 'm not a dolt . If I go into your cell , you will incapacitate me  --  perhaps even kill me and try to escape . " She cocked her head , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . I 've friends here who know what I plan . They wait . " " Then why did n't you bring them  --  to help you take my hair ? " His voice was sarcastic . He knew she bluffed . " Very well , " she said , sighing . She gathered up the sack and returned to the steps . She was halfway up the stairs before she turned , angry he was n't calling her back . The window of his cell was dark . Her heart beat wildly with fear , but something deep inside did n't believe he was capable of hurting her . He was a knight . He was honorable . So he had debauched a servant ? He was only a man after all , incapable of controlling his lusts . So he had nearly killed the woman 's husband ? The man had tried to kill him first . It was only instinct to defend oneself . Mona believed all these things , even though Ridley had condemned him as dangerous and stuck him in this hole . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to the door . It was locked with a heavy chain and a padlock . Mona had made this key years ago in case she was ever locked down here . " I 'm coming in . If aught happens to me , Lord Graham will see you gutted like a pig . " " Think you I 'd hurt a mere woman ? " Mona hesitated . " No . But I think you want freedom very badly . I can give it to you if you show patience . That 's why I need your hair . " " You 'll help me ? " " Yes . " " When ? " " Soon , I vow it . " And saying that , she knew she would free him even if he was n't the one . She did not make promises lightly . He came back to the door , eyeing her suspiciously . Relieved , Mona hid the key in the folds of her cloak . He would cooperate now . No need to enter his cell . His eyes narrowed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head innocently . His face closed up and he receded into the darkness again . " Go away . " Mona 's shoulders sagged . He was too clever by far . " I 'm coming in . Will you give me your word that I will come to no harm ? " " Aye , " the voice drifted to her through the door . " Then give it . " " You have my word I 'll not harm you . " Mona slipped the key into the lock . When the chain and lock were on the floor , she pulled the heavy oak door open as wide as it would go . " There 's no way out of the dungeons , " she called into the shadowy darkness , " but for the door at the top of the stairs , which is locked and guarded . If you will help me and be patient , I 'll arrange your escape . " There was no answer from the prisoner . The skin on Mona 's arms prickled , unwelcome memories of her first husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide like this . Just like Edwin , he is . They all are , Arlana 's voice whispered in her head . Sir Patrick is not like Edwin , Mona insisted and stepped into the cell . A hand seized her neck , another snaking around her waist . Her face and chest were crushed against the wall , a body solid as granite pinning her there . Her cheek pressed against the damp stone , her eyes staring wide into the dim light from the open door , breathing in the faint , metallic odor of the mold that coated the stones . The blood pounded in her head , a scream lodged in her throat . Just like Edwin . " You 're verra trusting , my lady , " Sir Patrick 's smug voice whispered in her ear . " You gave me your word ! " she choked out . She tried to control her fear . Boldness and courage disarmed most men . " I 'm a desperate man . " " You are a knight ! Have you no code of honor ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code is the ends justify the means . The end is freedom and you , my sweet lassie , are the means . " " I will help you escape . I gave you my word . " " Then help me now . " Mona shook her head . " I ca n't . The guard will never help me ... but I can arrange it if you 'll just let me . " He was quiet behind her , his muscles quivering with violence . Mona closed her eyes , praying he would do the right thing . She must assert her authority before this went any further . She forced herself to speak . " Give me the hair and nails . " He laughed , his breath stirring the hair beside her ear , the sound rumbling through his chest and into her back . " And do ye plan to rip it from my head ? " No , she 'd brought a knife , strapped to her thigh . But he was wise to her , his hands already rucking up her skirt , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrist , trying to stop him , but he found the knife . She trembled now , truly afraid . He slid the knife slowly from the sheath on her thigh , his fingers trailing unnecessarily against her bare skin . She shuddered , unused to being touched so intimately . The silver blade glittered before her face , orange in the torchlight spilling through the open door . " Are ye afraid ? " he asked . " No , " she said , pleased her voice was steady and clear . " Ye should be . " " You gave your word I would not be harmed . " He was quiet behind her , the even rise and fall of his chest against her back . He pushed away from the wall abruptly , freeing her . Mona turned cautiously only to find the knife offered to her , hilt first . She looked from the knife to his eyes , but his expression was unreadable . Faced with him , she was intimidated . He was enormous  --  nearly a head taller than her and broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length and his beard a thick tangle . He wore a doublet , torn and stained , with no shirt beneath it . His breeches were in similar condition , and he had no shoes . " It 's a wonder you are n't ill , " she said , accepting the knife and shaking her head . " One moment . " She left the cell and returned with the sack . " Here are clothes  --  please have them on when I return tomorrow to free you . It will make our escape easier . " He took the bag from her hesitantly , frowning all the while , eyes darting to the open door . She must be quick , before he changed his mind . " Kneel , please . " He became very still . " You 're too tall . Kneel so I may cut a lock of your hair . " He did as she bade , never taking his eyes from her face . She approached him , fear and resolve warring in her heart . She reached out and gently touched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't filthy . Beneath , near his nape , the hair was the color of golden sunlight . Mona cut it cleanly and slipped it into a pouch at her waist . She held her hand out . He cocked a brow , looking from her hand to her face . " Your hand , sir , so I may trim your nails . " He rubbed his hand self-consciously on his filthy breeches before placing it in hers . His hand swallowed hers , broad and muscular , the palm rough with calluses . She gently examined the nails . Dirty , but not unkempt . He 'd apparently attempted to groom himself . She trimmed his nails and released his hand . When she gestured for his other hand , he frowned . " How many do you need ? " " I have what I need , I just thought it would make you feel better . " He put his hands behind his back and rose to his feet , stepping away from her as if she were the dangerous one . He eyed her warily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pouch and went to the door , shutting it behind her . She replaced the chain and the padlock . When she was finished , he was at the barred window , watching her . " Because you are a great knight . Because you have honor . And ... I trust you . " He stared at her incredulously . " Have ye gone soft in the head ? " She smiled , pleased all had gone well . " Perhaps . " He did n't return her smile . " Until tomorrow , Sir Patrick , " she said , and left him alone in the dungeons . Mona sat cross-legged on her bed in her nightshift , bed curtains drawn and door locked . A single taper sat in its holder beside her . The curling lock of hair lay on the blanket before her , tied with a piece of string . She 'd carefully washed it in the basin earlier and spent an absurd amount of time admiring the golden color in the fading sunlight . The nail parings had also been cleaned . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of beads passed on to her from Arlana . Though they did constitute a map to the Clachan Fala , they had other uses as well . She held the items in her palm and asked for an answer to her dilemma . Could she survive without a protector ? And was Sir Patrick Maxwell the one ? It was such an important decision , not to be made lightly or without aid . How she wished for Arlana 's counsel , though she knew they would only argue . According to the old witch , no man was to be trusted . She would advise Mona to do this alone . And yet Ridley 's behavior toward her was proof she was not safe alone . He 'd destroyed the herb garden today out of spite . She must have a man , however distasteful the prospect . Mona put the objects in the pouch , held it tightly between her palms , and asked , Is Sir Patrick a match for Ridley ? His reputation preceded him and was the reason Ridley had held him for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and Austrian kings . He 'd fought the Turks and the Spanish . He 'd even served in the king of France 's personal guard . And on his infrequent returns to Scotland , he rode with the Annan Maxwells in many highly successful raids . In fact , when word was out that Sir Patrick was in the country , the Maxwells ' enemies began madly fortifying their homes against attack , usually to little effect . Such skill would be essential to stop Ridley . But was it enough ? Ridley was cunning , moved in ways that were not clear . He was acquiring much land on the West March and arranging marriages for himself and his sisters . Mona knew this had to do with the war King Henry threatened to bring down on the Scots , that Ridley felt these things would help him accomplish something , but she did n't understand what . More importantly , Ridley believed in the power of the Clachan Fala  --  that it would protect him from all harm . Seduced by the legends , he was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought of the Bloodstone . Always it had been something distant , unattainable . Only one Keeper had ever been charged with fetching it , and she had almost immediately returned it to hiding . How could such an instrument not overcome even the purest heart ? And that brought Mona to her last question . When the Bloodstone was finally in her hands , what would Sir Patrick do ? Would he be seduced by its power ? Or could he be trusted to help her deliver it to his brother , Robert Maxwell , Lord Annan ? A love match betwixt a Graham of the Eden grayne and a Maxwell of the Annan grayne will bring it from hiding . The iuchair had told her Caroline found love with Lord Annan . The time had come . Mona blew out the candle and crawled beneath the blanket , sliding the pouch beneath her pillow . She lay her head upon the pillow and asked for her dreams to reveal her path . Patrick spent the night alternately berating himself for being a softhearted fool and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free now ! She was insane  --  or worse , evil . And he had let the opportunity to escape slip through his fingers . Of course , if he 'd attempted to escape , he might also be dead . He knew the dungeons were guarded at all times and that the men-at-arms were well trained and armed to the teeth . Though he 'd done his best to keep his body exercised and ready for anything , the months in the dungeon had taken their toll . Some mornings the cold seeped into his knees and elbows , the now mended bones aching and stiff . Old wounds , long healed , were causing him discomfort . But he would be ready for anything if  --  no , when  --  she returned . He spent endless hours pacing his cell and pulling his body up on the bars until his arms trembled with fatigue . Tonight he worked himself to near collapse . It had been too long since he 'd been with a woman , and the scent of Lady Graham , the silken feel of her thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary prisoner . When he finally fell asleep , the dreams came . It was the battle of Mohacs tonight . The Hungarian king charged across the marshy bank of the Danube , splashing into its overflowing waters , lords and knights following . Patrick was certain taking warhorses onto boggy ground was a bad idea , but the melee confused him , having previously only fought in border skirmishes . Fighting the Turks turned out to be a different matter entirely and so , when his commander had fallen , he followed King Louis into the river . The water was shocking , the current nearly sweeping him off his mount . The horse balked , trying to retreat back to the bank , but hands grasped at Patrick 's legs , his saddle , pulling him off , into the rushing river . His armor was too heavy , dragging him under . He sunk to the bottom like a boulder , fear straining his lungs . He struggled t imagination . Useless thoughts for a solitary prisoner .

He saw the face of Isaac float by , bloated and blue , grabbing at him , forcing him down in the watery grave . Patrick fought to wake himself . A dream ! A dream ! He was sitting up in the cold cell , bare-chested . The fat candle Lady Graham had brought him still burned . He 'd shredded his doublet and flung it across the room in his sleep . His chest heaved , the bread and water he 'd consumed hours ago threatening to make a reappearance . Isaac . Bloody hell ! He fought to put his old friend from his mind .
