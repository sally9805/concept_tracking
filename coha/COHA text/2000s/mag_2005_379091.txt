When they try to intimidate us , we will not be intimidated . When they seek to change our country or our way of life by these methods , we will not be changed . When they try to divide our people or weaken our resolve , we will not be divided and our resolve will hold firm . " There were echoes of Winston Churchill when a grim-faced Tony Blair spoke from Downing Street last Thursday to express outrage and determination in the face of the dreaded attack on London that he had long warned was inevitable . <P> Blair 's detractors condemn him as addicted to packaging and spin , and it 's true he 's slick at the arts of modern political communication . But they miss how naturally resolve comes to him . His performance last week was that of a man in full , an act of deftly judged juggling between directing his government 's response to the bombings and trying to make sure the G-8 meeting of world leaders he was chairing at Gleneagles , a bucolic resort in Scotland , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been straining to achieve for a year . After the bombings , he plowed through several press conferences , as well as emergency meetings of a Cabinet committee and eleventh-hour bargaining sessions at Gleneagles from which he secured an agreement to double aid to Africa by 2010 . He did it all without putting a foot wrong  --  on three hours ' sleep . That kind of mastery under extreme strain can not be faked ; it shows an almost ferocious resilience at his core . <P> Now , in the wake of the bombings , what use will he make of it ? An aide , who was more exhausted than his boss , said , " We have n't begun to think about what comes next "  --  although a controversial bill to require sophisticated ID cards will probably get a terrorism-inspired lease on life . But Blair 's final term has been transformed . When he won re-election two months ago  --  his parliamentary majority was cut from 161 to 67 , mostly because of anger over how he oversold the war in Iraq  --  there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would quickly drain to his heir apparent , Gordon Brown , the Chancellor of the Exchequer . <P> That prediction now seems almost comical . The derailing of the European Union constitution by the no votes in France and the Netherlands saved Blair from waging a campaign to ratify it in Britain that he almost certainly would have lost . Blair has managed to turn the ensuing chaos in the E.U. to his advantage , arguing forcefully to Europeans over the heads of their leaders that Britain 's lower-regulation , higher-growth model shows a way out of the problems that have made them so dyspeptic . The selection of London last week to host the 2012 Olympics provided Blair with another long-odds win . ( Blair was so nervous about the result that he took a walk rather than watch the announcement on TV . ) And by focusing the G-8 on Africa and coordinating his goals closely with those of campaigners like Bono and Bob Geldof , Blair has burnished the progressive credentials that his blood brotherhood with George W. Bush over Iraq had obscured .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
