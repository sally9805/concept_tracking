Father and son find adventure-and each otherin a 600-mile circle of the Northern Bahamas in a small boat . Story and Photos by JOHN CLEMANS and CHRISTOPHER CLEMANS // It looked really windy outside the hotel . There was a flag that was straight out instead of flat down . The boat was in the water behind the Boston Whaler store in Ft . Lauderdale . We had put it in on a ramp . We left about seven o'clock . It was kind of rough and I kept asking Dad are we going . He kept saying we 'll see . The boat kept bouncing . It was kind of fun . Any owner of a small boat who has read Hemingway 's observation that you do n't have to look for trouble at sea , because it will find you , never forgets it . When the inlet and then the water offshore are as rough as they were that day , the warning rings in your ears . Is this the prudent thing to be doing ? You wonder . Especially when your companion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a little wet , even on OBF-that 's what we sometimes call our rubber boat , which is really named Nautica Two and always keeps the spray away . OBF means One Big Fender . But I did n't have to put on my raincoat . We went up over the waves and down the other side . Bimini is long and small . You do n't aim right at it . There 's two sticks on the beach and when one of them gets lined up with the other one you can go in and out . The Gulf Stream is an enigma . " Seas three feet to five feet offshore . Higher in the Gulf Stream . " That 's a common refrain on South Florida weather channels . Yet , the Gulf Stream is sometimes kinder than the water on either side of it . The seas may be higher , but the waves are usually farther apart , which makes the going much easier . Especially in a Nautica 22 , our trusty hard-bottom inflatable which has proven itself seaworthy far beyond its dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue runner off Hole in the Wall ; docking at Valentine 's Marina an Harbour Island ; watching the sunset from the beach in Bimini ; running in the surf at Treasure Cay. // We were on the first leg of a Bahamas cruise . " Adventure " is more like it in a boat this size . Our route would constitute a circumnavigation of the northern Bahamas , a clear-water paradise commencing only 50 nautical miles from the U.S. mainland-truly a special place , a resource that makes owning a boat so rewarding for so many Floridians . Our starting point was Ft . Lauderdale . We 'd wind up back in Stuart . First stop : Bimini . Bimini has grown , but it has n't changed much . It still has the Bahamas ' best sunsets . The shops and houses now line the road all the way up to the gates of what is currently and perennially a languishing attempt to establish a resort on the northern half . The pines along the beach have been sadly thinned-the pines for which the most famous fishing hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game Club still dominates the scene . The Blue Water and Seacrest are other fine marinas . The seaplanes still come and go . The bonefish still make do in a foot of water on the flats , and Ansil Saunders is still the best guide . Eat in the Red Lion . Visit the Compleat Angler . Buy a T-shirt and something made of straw . Do n't miss the sunsets . Troll off the pines . The week before we arrived , an 854pound blue was caught-the largest marlin since Sam Jennings ' record 1,062pounder in 1979 . That 's marlin fishing . That 's Bimini . You never know . They drive on the wrong side of the road . But the road only has a middle and people walk in it . Captain Bob 's is the best place to eat breakfast and lunch . There 's a beach on the other side that 's nice and has lots of sea glass on it and there 's rock steps going down near where Arnold Hemingway used to live . There 's lots of pictures of him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string on a hook . He liked to shoot a gun . I flew a kite on the beach . We were going to leave for Atlantis , but when we looked out in that direction there were storms with big black clouds with rain and lightning . So we did n't go . Later it was nice , so we went fishing . I caught a lot offish on pieces of conch we got in a store . Dad said they were trigger fish . The next morning we headed for Nassau . We cruised down to Gun Cay , just north of Cat Cay-the exclusive Bahama sanctuary where so many lovely homes stand , and where tuna tournaments helped put these waters on the sportfishing map and spur the development of biggame boats . It 's the island where hurricane Andrew swept a 40-foot sailboat into Bebe Rebozzo 's swimming pool . At the south end of Gun Cay we swung cast onto the flats . We could have gone north from Bimini to North Rock and turned east , but that 's a bit longer route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was flat calm and I could kneel in the bow and look over into the water It was blurry because we were going fast , But I could see all sorts of things fly by underneath us . This is my favorite spot on the boat . Crossing the plateau of the Great Bahama Bank to Northwest Channel light is one of the most glorious runs on earth . The crystal clear water is only six or eight feet deep and land is nowhere in sight . Deep-draft boats avoid low tide , and for first-timers the shallowness can be unnerving , but we passed 50- and 60footers along the way . Big pink blob The water deepens immediately after the Northwest Channel marker . You 're back in the ocean , at least the " Tongue of the Ocean , " as the area is called . Iridescent aqua suddenly gives way to indigo . New terrain , rougher , more like crossing the Gulf Stream-and winds from the southeast can make this passage just as rough . Here you can hook a left to Chub Cay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north coast of New Providence . Almost as soon as you spot the coastline , you notice a pink blob in the distance . It 's Nassau 's new , mustsee destination , and it 's hard to miss . Atlantis is the best hotel in the world because it has a water park attached right to it . There 's also a cave that 's an aquarium and tunnels with sharks swimming over your head , and so many pools I ca n't remember them all . I saw two NBA players I knew in the elevator Cleverly designed , so that we could discover no route to our room that did not lead through the casino , Atlantis sits on Paradise Island across the harbor from Nassau , and dwarfs everything within a long day 's cruise and beyond . The 63slip marina is totally protected and is usually home to a dozen megayachts . It 's more expensive to dock here than at Hurricane Harbour , but consider the perksespecially for kids . We lingered , getting lost in the labyrinthine " dig " and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had little to do with the Bahamas , but we 're not purists . I was sorry to leave Atlantis because it 's a place where there 's so much fun stuff that you never run out . But we had to head for a new place . It was a place that Dad and I had never been to before . Like so many Bahamas islands , Eleuthera is long and thin like a mountain ridge . It 's southern tip is at the intersection of two lines-one running southsoutheast from Ft . Lauderdale through Bimini and Nassau , the other running almost north up through the Abaco Cays . These lines form a cone that contains the entire northern Bahamas . Instead of going down and around Eleuthera , which would have included the whole island in the " circle route " we were taking , we cruised northeast from Nassau , sheltered by Eleuthera from the open Atlantic until we got around Egg Island , and turned east toward Spanish Wells . Our destination was Harbour Island off northern Eleuthera 's east coast . The devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a local pilot ( call on channel 16 ) from Ridley Channel to Harbour Island , because the route is a narrow one between the beach and the reef known as the Devil 's Backbone , and between Current Point and Man Island . Harbour Island has two marinas just south of Dunmore Town : Valentines and the Harbour Island Club . We docked at Valentines , one of the most convivial marinas in the Bahamas and just a golf cart 's jaunt from the pink sand beach and some of the best restaurants in the islands . From there , we fished for yellowtail ( the cut is at the south end of Harbour Island ) and snorkeled on the shallow side of Jacobs Island and Man Island . Harbour Island is neat . The marina had a nice pool . All the people were really friendly and the fishing was great . I would really like to go back there . I drove a golf cart . Do n't tell . For me , the run from Eleuthera north to the Abacos was the high point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you forever . We could have aimed almost due north , straight at Marsh Harbour , which would have put us over 20 miles off the sparsely populated coast of Great Abaco in the open Atlantic with nothing between us and Africa . We headed instead across the 30-mile-wide Northeast Providence Channel for Abaco 's most southerly point , Hole in the Wall . From there we could run up along the Abaco coast with land in sight . The weather was crystal clear , . the sea was lively and the boat bounced along at 30 mph , the four-stroke Yamaha 50s running smoothly , as usual . They call it Hole in the Wall because there is a hole in the wall . It looked like we could drive the boat right through it , but Dad said that would n't be a good idea . The waves crashed into the rocks and we got very close to the cliff by the lighthouse . I drove the boat while Dad to6k pictures . Then Dad said " look at the birds , " and there were birds all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . The swells suddenly boiled with surface activity and schools of birds magically materialized . This point , past which the Atlantic pushes in search of a western shore , is loaded with school tuna and big bottom fish . Fishing in the Bahamas , the hard spots to get to are usually the best . Hole-in-the Wall is a truly wild and lonely place , spectacularly photogenic with its namesake rock formation and banded lighthouse . A natural playground The coast is similarly desolate all the way up to Cherokee Sound and Little Harbour , where the Johnston sculpture studio makes this quiet anchorage unique . From here north you 're in one of the world 's most popular tropical cruising grounds-the Abacos . The boomerangshaped land mass of Great and Little Abaco , or the " mainland , " is fenced off from the Atlantic by scores of " cays " that dissipate the ocean 's power and form one side of a 100-mile-long sound , the vast majority of which is at least eight feet deep . It 's a natural playground . Development of several cays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-mile wide bay as you make your way north or south . Heading north from where we were , it goes something like this : Little Harbour , Elbow Cay ( Hopetown ) , Marsh Harbour , Man 0 War , Guana Cay , Treasure Cay , Green Turtle Cay , Cooperstown , Spanish Cay and on home , back across the Gulf Stream to Stuart , first passing Grand Bahama to port and Walker 's Cay to starboard-two stops we missed on this trip-thus completing a big sweep around the northern Bahamas . I 've been here before , and I know some of the names of the islands we go to from Marsh Harbour when I see what 's on them . I know Nippers . It has a pool that 's two pools , one up higher than the other-sweet , super sweet . I know Sandy Cay , because that 's where we like to dive . You just tie the boat to a big white ball . I know Treasure Cay , because that 's where the great beach is . I know Spanish Cay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . There are no cars . Marsh Harbour is the best place to stay . The rooms are big and you get all the channels . Out-island charm Marsh Harbour is the hub . The availability of parts , services , provisions , the presence of good restaurants and the hospitality and marina at the Abaco Beach Resort have made it the boating and fishing center of the Bahamas . But do n't miss the other stops . They all have more " out-island " appeal . Each has its own charm . Hurricane Floyd severely damaged Harbour Island and the Abacos , but reconstruction is underway and most everything should be open by spring . Study the chart to see where the shallow spots are in Abaco Sound , but the basic rule is to stay in the middle , between the " mainland " and the barrier islands . Only shallow-draft boats can safely negotiate the " inland " route between Treasure Cay and Whale Cay . Unless it 's very rough off Whale , I always go through the cut and around . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Bahamas-what to take , where to eat , safety tips . But there is n't room , except to say do n't leave home without Steve Dodge 's Cruising Guide to Abaco , the single best book of its kind . Christopher could write about what he learned-what to do if I fell overboard , how to read the GPS and use the radio . But there is n't room . There 's only room for him to say : I hope we take this same trip again soon ! <p>
