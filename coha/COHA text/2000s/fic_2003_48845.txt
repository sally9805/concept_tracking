ONE MORNING , JACKIE RODE along with his father on his collection route . The day was clear , and all along the blacktop the sun glinted off silo domes . A jet left a white trail across the blue sky . Wheat fields , golden and ripe , stretched off to the horizon , but the newly planted beans and corn were already wanting for rain . The clay soil had cracked and turned as white as plaster . <p> " Riding high in the crow 's nest , " Jackie 's father said . <p> " Yo , ho , ho , " said Jackie because this is what he always said when his father made his remark about the cab of the tank truck being high above the other vehicles on the blacktop . Jackie thought it was fine to be able to see into the cars they met , to be so far above them that he could see the tops of people 's heads , even their feet on the floorboards . He made note of their shoes : sneakers , penny loafers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent than the one before it . His own shoes were made by a man in Vincennes , an old German with a leather apron and a red nose . One shoe , the right one , had a higher heel than the left , a thicker sole , because Jackie had been born with his right leg shorter . His shoes , the same kind year after year , were bulky oxfords , black with three pairs of eyelets for the cord laces . " Built to last , " the shoemaker always said . " Not some silly shoe for you . " <p> Jackie 's father turned off the blacktop , onto the Bethlehem Church Road , and the tank truck bounced over the ruts . Jackie thought of the red letters on the side of the silver tank-Marathon-the letters painted over the drawing of a runner , a flaming torch held in his hand . Jackie knew , because his father had told him , the story of how the Greeks had defeated the Persians at Marathon and how a runner had carried the news twenty-six miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like to run that far . " You know when we drive to Vincennes to buy your shoes ? " his father had said once . Jackie had pictured the highway running along muskmelon and watermelon patches in the bottomland , the bridge arcing over the Wabash River , and then the spires of the Old Cathedral rising up as they drove into the city . " That 's how far , " his father had said , and Jackie had marveled at the enormity that could make a man run that distance , his lungs bursting with all he had to tell . <p> " Yo , ho , ho , " Jackie said again , only this time he said it with his mouth closed and in a muffled voice that made it seem that the words came from a concealed place , the glove compartment , perhaps , or the toolbox on the seat , or the tank itself , full of gasoline , riding behind the cab . <p> " You crack me up , " his father said . " You and that voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had learned how to form letters with his tongue , how to say words without moving his lips , only the tongue waggling in the cavity he made inside his mouth . He could imitate a muffled sound and then " throw " it . He made pies talk , drawers , closets , flowerpots . " Listen closely to everything around you , " his ventriloquism manual said , " and when you speak , think what you want to hear . " <p> He had learned his fifth-grade classmates ' voices and could imitate them perfectly . On occasion , he would make it seem that one of them had said something outrageous right in the middle of class , and the teacher would stop her lesson to scold him . She had long ago learned his trick . Even if someone really did speak out of turn , she would put the blame on Jackie . If he tried to tell her the truth , she would n't believe him . <p> " No one likes a joker , mister , " his mother told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened closely to what she said , learned that phrase . " Cool your coppers . " He said it while drinking water one night at the supper table , a new trick he had perfected . " Cool your coppers , " he said in his mother 's voice , and his father laid down his fork , narrowed his eyes , and said to her , " What did you say ? " <p> " I did n't say anything , " she told him . " It 's that son of yours . He 's tormenting me . He thinks he 's a funny man . Ha , ha , Jackie . Ha , ha . " <p> He did n't think he was a funny man , not in his heart of hearts . There he thought he was , to borrow something his father often said after coming in from his route , the saddest goddamn thing he had ever seen . " It 's the saddest goddamn thing , " his father said and then he launched into a story of a customer down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil prices , in light of the drought , made it hard for the farmers to keep up with their fuel bills . <p> Jackie knew all the words for what he was : a cripple , a handicap , a gimp . Often , when he was alone in his room , he stared at himself in the mirror . He pressed his lips together and let his tongue form words in his own voice , speaking everything that was inside him that he could n't bear for anyone to hear . He talked about how sad he was- " Goddamn gimp " how it was n't his fault- " I did n't do anything " - about how angry it made him . " I 'll mow ' em down , " he said , using the old Charlie McCarthy line he had heard on a tape of the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen . The line sounded paltry when Jackie said it . " I swear , I 'll mow ' em down . " <p> Their first stop was a farm off the Bethlehem Church Road , a family named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's class at school . He had silky blond hair , bleached white by the sun in summer . He had prominent cheekbones and brilliant blue eyes . Jackie would have thought him quite lovely if not for the fact that Eugene scared him . Eugene was too big for his age , much bigger than Jackie , and he was clumsy and also stupid with his lessons . But what terrified Jackie most was how sometimes he would glance over at Eugene and find him staring at him with his blue eyes , not with anger , but with hunger , taking in every bit of him , and it made Jackie nervous because he had no idea what Eugene wanted . <p> " Teach me how you do that thing , " he had said to Jackie one day on the playground . It was the last day of school that spring . " That thing with your voice , " Eugene said . His own voice was raspy as if he were always hoarse from shouting , and he had a lisp that further distinguished him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene 's blue eyes narrowed . " And I 'm just a dummy , right ? " <p> " I did n't mean that . " <p> " I know what you meant . " He gave Jackie a half-hearted push . <p> " No , really . I just meant it takes a lot of practice . " <p> Eugene grabbed Jackie by the front of his shirt and pulled him close . His lips , when he spoke , brushed against Jackie 's chin . " You better never tell no one I asked you . You hear me ? Not no one . " <p> " I wo n't tell , " Jackie said . <p> Eugene kissed him-a shy , soft kiss on his cheek-before shoving him away and running into the school . <p> Jackie did n't know what to do with this kiss . Later , as the teacher passed out their report cards , he said , in Eugene 's raspy , lisping voice , " Sweet Jesus . All F 's . " <p> Their teacher took him out in the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudged it forward until his nose was touching the cold metal of a locker . " You just stand there , " she said . " You think about what a tragedy it is when the only way someone can build himself up is by belittling someone else . You do n't know the life Eugene has . You ought to leave him alone . " <p> Later , as they were getting on the school bus , Eugene tripped Jackie and sent him sprawling across the asphalt . For weeks there were scabs on his knees . Now the new skin was bright and pink . He rubbed his finger over his right knee as his father turned the tank truck into the Markses ' lane . <p> Mr. Marks was cutting wheat in the field along the lane . He was emptying the hopper of his combine . The wheat streamed out of the spout angled over the high sideboards of the grain truck . Jackie followed his father over the freshly cut field , the wheat stubble tickling his ankles . <p> Mr. Marks was cursing at Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scoop shovel . " Goddamn it . Shovel it to the back . Goddamn it . Keep up . " <p> The grain rushed out onto the hump of wheat that had built up as other hoppers had been unloaded , and it was Eugene 's job to level the pile by shoveling it to the back . It was clear to Jackie that he could n't keep up . The shovel was too heavy , the wheat was coming too fast . He floundered around in the wheat , which was nearly up to his thighs , and Jackie could feel the stumbling motion in his own legs . Finally , Mr. Marks climbed over the sideboards and jerked the shovel from Eugene 's hands . " Get out of here . " He gave him a rough shove . " Go on . I 'll do it myself . " <p> Eugene crawled over the sideboards and jumped to the ground . Jackie 's father was standing on the truck 's running board now , shouting to make himself heard over the noise of the combine and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something on account . " <p> " On account of what ? " Mr. Marks bent and hefted a shovelful of wheat . He slung it toward the back of the truck 's bed . His hands were big , the fingers short and thick . One thumbnail was split ; the creases of his knuckles were black with grime . <p> " A few dollars . " Jackie 's father had his ticket book out . He licked the point of his pencil . " Just so I can feel good about carrying you awhile . " <p> " I 'm cutting wheat . I do n't have time for you now . You 'll get your money . " <p> " I 'd like to be sure . " <p> " I 'd like to be rich , " Mr. Marks said . " Shit in one hand and wish with the other and see which one fills up first . " <p> Jackie was embarrassed for his father , embarrassed for himself . Eugene had wandered over behind the combine where the belts were spinning on their flywheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie , " Eugene called to him . Jackie went to where Eugene was waiting , and the two of them stood face to face in the shadow cast by the combine . Eugene bit down on his lip the way Jackie had seen him do in school when he was trying to figure out an arithmetic problem . Jackie heard his father and Mr. Marks shouting , but now their voices , swallowed up by the combine 's noise , were merely drones , vibrations of sound that buzzed the way Jackie sometimes heard voices from other people 's conversations bleeding over when he was talking on the telephone-voices that sounded small and frantic , coming from some far-off place he could n't imagine . <p> Eugene unfastened his blue jeans and let them slide down his hips and knees until they settled in a pile at his feet . His legs were striped with welts-some old and fading , others fresh and pink-and Jackie understood that Mr. Marks had left them there with his belt . Eugene did n't say a word . He merely took Jackie 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hot and moist . Jackie was afraid to look at Eugene , but finally he did , and what he saw was a face of dread and expectation , a look similar to the one Jackie 's teacher had when she was waiting for students to answer questions , to demonstrate how much she had taught them . Eugene bowed his head , and his fine hair lifted up in the wind around the combine 's flywheels . Something fluttered inside Jackie . He thought of the way his hip sometimes ached in the night , and he longed for someone to make it stop . He could n't keep himself from tipping his own head down until it touched Eugene 's . Jackie felt Eugene 's silky hair on his forehead , and he thought it the most delightful sensation , the soft tickle of that wispy hair . <p> " I 'm sorry I pushed you down , " Eugene said . " That last day of school . " <p> " I should n't have done your voice , " said Jackie . " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their heads nuzzling the way Jackie had often seen newborn calves rubbing along their mothers ' flanks . He worked up the courage to ask Eugene the question that had been puzzling him all summer . " How come you kissed me ? " <p> " There 's all kinds of mean . " Eugene 's voice was a hoarse whisper . " We know it , do n't we ? You and me . " <p> " Yes , " Jackie said . " We know it . " <p> Then the tractor 's throttle fell back , and the combine 's flywheels stopped spinning . The quiet startled him . His father called his name . He drew his hand away from Eugene 's wound , and calling , " Here I am , " he ran out into the light . <p> That evening , after his mother had finished washing dishes , Jackie tried to tell her about the welts on Eugene 's legs . But before he could , something about the way the light came into the house-a muted light just before dusk-and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamy , mesmerized him , and he could n't speak . <p> She untied her apron and hung it on the hook inside the pantry door . She had n't yet turned on a light . The white curtains at the kitchen window lifted with the breeze , and Jackie smelled the grapes in the arbor , the one his father had kept alive during the drought by hauling river water from Paducah . The grapes ' perfume was splendid , as were the cooing of the mourning doves gathered in the lane and the three-note call of the whippoorwill somewhere far back in the woods . <p> " Well , Mr. Jackie , " his mother said , " another day . " <p> " Another dollar , " he told her , which was what his father sometimes said . <p> She polished the faucet until it gleamed . " Oh , dumpling , " she said . " Let 's not think of your father 's nasty business just now . " <p> A radio sat on the counter . She switched it on and the gentle strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's You Belong to Me , " ' She closed her eyes and swayed her head . " See the pyramids along the Nile . " ' She sang along . " Come on , Jackie . Dance with me . " <p> It was the most extraordinary thing-to be moving with his mother across the floor . He followed her lead , listened to her humming along with the song . For the first time ever , he felt graceful . " You 're really very light on your feet , " his mother told him . He could smell the lemony scent of the dish detergent still on her hands . " You 're a regular Fred Astaire . " Then the radio went dead . " We must have blown a fuse . " She sighed . " Oh dear . " <p> She tried to move away from Jackie , but he would n't let her . He kept the song playing by imitating a saxophone , muted and raspy . To its melody , he danced with his mother there in the twilight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away , it was as if it had never happened at all . <p> Later , after Jackie 's father had replaced the blown fuse , the three of them sat on the front porch and listened to the faint grumble of thunder in the west . The sky flickered with lightning flashes along the horizon , and Jackie 's father stepped out into the yard . The days had been so hot and dry . Cars moving along the gravel roads trailed plumes of dust . The dust settled over the milkweed and the foxtail in the fencerows . <p> " Heat lightning , " Jackie 's mother said . " Just a fizzle and a tease . " <p> But then a few raindrops fell . Jackie could hear them hitting the leaves on the grapevines in the arbor . He held out his hand and felt one drop and then another . <p> " Maybe I was wrong . " His mother clapped her hands . " Maybe we 're going to get a shower . If it comes a soaker , I 'll kick off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care how wet I get . What about that , Jackie ? Would n't that be fun ? " <p> Jackie imagined his mother dancing in the rain , stomping about their yard , mud splattering her bare legs . She would slip and stumble and laugh like an idiot . He rested his head against the porch post , closed his eyes , and listened to the slow patter of the raindrops . He remembered the radio playing " You Belong to Me " only moments before in the kitchen and how marvelous it had been to dance with her . <p> Soon the raindrops stopped . Jackie opened his eyes and saw his father still standing in the yard , his hands on his hips , his head tipped back , face to the sky . " Not enough to lay the dust . " He looked down at his feet . He kicked at the hard ground . " This drought . I swear . It 's got me in a tight spot . " <p> " There are people worse off than us , " Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . " He came back to the porch and laid his hand on the post just above where Jackie was resting his head . " And they all owe me money . " There was still the distant sound of thunder . " Hear that ? That 's God having a good chuckle over all us poor dogs down here , us saps . " <p> Jackie knew that something had happened . The good-natured fun his mother and father had poked at the drought and the tease of rain had dried up , and now there was an edge to his father 's voice . He slapped his hand against the porch post , and Jackie felt the vibration in his head . " And all we can do , " his father said , " is take it . " <p> Jackie started to speak , and what he told his mother and father was that Eugene Marks , that day in the wheat field , had let down his blue jeans and had shown Jackie the welts on his legs . Jackie described how hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think his dad did it , " he said . " I think he whips him with his belt . " <p> For a good while , neither Jackie 's mother nor his father spoke . Jackie saw them glance at each other and then look away . His mother crossed her arms over her chest as if she had suddenly caught a chill . His father pressed his lips together , took a deep breath through his nose , and then let it out . <p> " You know we love you , do n't you , Jackie ? " he said . " No matter . . His mother interrupted . " He knows that . You do , do n't you , sweetie ? " <p> " But Eugene ..... Jackie said . <p> His mother opened her arms and held them out to him . " Come here and give me a hug , " she said . " Do n't you worry about such awful things . " <p> The next afternoon , Mr. Marks came to call . Jackie was helping his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the concords hung in blue-black clusters . Wasps flitted about , drinking from the grapes that the birds had pecked . <p> " Well , it 's cool here in the shade . " Mr. Marks took off his feed cap , and holding it by the bill , he fanned his face . He closed his eyes and tipped back his head . " This is the greenest goddamn place I 've seen in a long time . " <p> " My husband likes grape jelly , " Jackie 's mother said . <p> " Your husband . " Mr. Marks lowered his head and opened his eyes . <p> " He 's a real go-Better , ai n't he ? He gets his nose down a hole , he do n't say quit . " <p> Jackie knew , then , that Mr. Marks 's visit had something to do with his unpaid bill . <p> " Let me tell you how it is , missus . " Mr. Marks put his cap back on his head and tugged on the brim . " This drought 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a whisper , as if he could barely say the words . " I 'll be lucky if I get enough from my crops to rub two pennies together . I do n't much have a pot to piss in . You tell your husband to leave off with his pestering me for money . Ca n't get blood from a turnip . " He tried to laugh , but it came out in a hoarse croak . " Ai n't that what they say ? " <p> " Yes , that 's the old joke , " Jackie 's mother said . <p> " Ai n't no joke , " said Mr. Marks . " Not when it 's you with your head in the ground . " <p> Jackie opened his mouth , meaning to ask after Eugene , to say something like , " How 's Eugene ? Is he all right ? Please tell him I said hello . " But just then a wasp swooped down from the concords . It flew into Jackie 's mouth . He felt its papery wings brush the inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he did the only thing he could think : he ran . He ran out of the arbor , his blocky shoes slowing him . He felt the wasp sting him on the tongue , then he stumbled and fell face first to the ground . He lay there in the dust , his tongue throbbing , the wasp gone away from him . <p> " Jackie , " his mother called . She was picking him up from the dust . " Jackie . My word . " <p> " We all got our hardships , do n't we , missus ? " Mr. Marks said . " No money , crops burned up . Crippled boy . We 're all just trying to get along . " <p> " He 's not crippled , " Jackie 's mother said . <p> Mr. Marks reached up and picked a grape from the vine . " No , and the sun do n't set in the west , " he said . Then he mashed the grape between his finger and thumb . <p> That night , when Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasp , he laughed . " Partner , " he said to Jackie , " that 's the saddest goddamn thing . " <p> Jackie 's mother was at the stove , cooking down the grape pulp . Steam rose from the kettle and left her hair limp and her face red . <p> " Do n't talk about him like he 's one of your sob stories , " she said . <p> Jackie was sitting on a stool by the sink . His mother had made a paste from baking soda and water and spread it over the wasp sting on his tongue . He could still taste the cakey powder , and he held his mouth open and his tongue partway out as if he were an old dog panting . <p> " Oh , I 'm just having fun , " his father said . " You know that , do n't you , partner ? Just trying to take the sting out . You get it ? The sting ? " <p> Jackie wished that his father would turn away , go into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother would go back to her canning . He loved to watch her pour the hot jelly into the glass jars and then cover it with melted paraffin . " Sealing in all the goodness , " she always said . <p> But now she said to Jackie 's father , " You should have heard Bob Marks . That horrible man . He called Jackie a cripple . Your son . " She banged the stirring spoon against the kettle 's rim . " Crippled boy , " she said , imitating Mr. Marks . <p> Jackie could hear something boiling up inside her , something that had nothing to do with Mr. Marks at all . She had done him so well , she had revealed herself . Jackie had read in his ventriloquist 's manual that people once thought that ventriloquists ' sounds came from their stomachs-belly talk-as if they had swallowed words whole , as if everything they had kept inside was now speaking . <p> The rage was rising in his father as well . " He said that ? Goddamn him . Goddamn him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to . What gives him the right to talk that way about me ? I ought to go over there . I ought to . . . " <p> " You 're not going anywhere , " Jackie 's mother said . The grapes were boiling and hissing , and spattering juice onto the stove . She turned down the flame . " Listen to yourself . You sound just like him . Ugly . I do n't know what 's got into us . " <p> " Are you telling me what to do ? " <p> " Yes , I 'm telling you . " <p> " You ca n't stop me . I 'll go over there , and I 'll take Jackie with me . I 'll tell Bob Marks , Go on . Say it . Say my boy 's a cripple . Goddamn it , say it and I 'll knock your teeth down your throat . " ' <p> The sun was low on the horizon when Jackie and his father got to the Markses ' farm . It was a red sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted Jackie 's father to say , " Red at night , sailor 's delight . " But he was n't talking now . He had n't said a word since his threat a few minutes before to knock Bob Marks 's teeth down his throat . Jackie had followed him out of their house , knowing without having to ask , that this was what his father expected . His mother had said , " Jackie , you stay here , " but he had n't listened to her . Something about the way she had imitated Mr. Marks had wounded him-something about the way her mouth had twisted and her eyes had squinted and she had spit the words as if she truly felt disgust for Jackie . He had n't wanted to be alone with her , so he had gone with his father . <p> Mr. Marks and Eugene were in the wheat field , and Jackie could see that they were finishing their supper . There were chicken bones in the wheat stubble at their feet and Mason jars of sweet tea and the spiral of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lap . He pulled off a section and used the point of his pocketknife blade to pick out the seeds . Then he held the section out to Eugene , who had tipped back his head and opened his mouth the way Jackie had seen baby birds do in their nests . Mr. Marks laid the orange section on Eugene 's tongue and then went to work on another piece , again working out the seeds . <p> Eugene closed his eyes and held the orange section in his mouth , sucking at it , his cheeks folding in and out . Jackie knew he was letting the juice trickle down his throat , making the sweet taste last . The grain truck , and the tractor and combine behind it , cast long shadows over the wheat stubble , and the aroma of the orange put a pleasant tang into the evening air . <p> The scene was something Jackie had n't expected : Mr. Marks feeding orange sections to Eugene there in the shadows , so cool after the day 's hot sun . Jackie could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking through the field as if he were suddenly ashamed of the sound his boots were making in the stubble . <p> Finally Mr. Marks spoke . " Boy do n't like to feel the seeds in his mouth . " He finished picking out the seeds in the last piece of orange and then wiped his pocketknife blade across his leg . " It do n't cost me nothing to work ' em out . " He put the last orange section in Eugene 's mouth and turned his attention to Jackie 's father . " I told your missus for you to back off . Now here you are again . " <p> Jackie followed his father into the shadow . The scent of the orange was stronger there , and Jackie thought about how sweet his own home had smelled-the grapes cooking down on his mother 's stove-while she had told the story of Mr. Marks and what he had said that afternoon in the arbor . <p> " I hear you said more than that when you were over to my place today , " Jackie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my son the way you did . " <p> " What was it I said ? " Mr. Marks used his pocketknife to trim the top off a callous on his forefinger . " I do n't hardly recollect . " <p> Jackie understood immediately what had happened . Mr. Marks , with his question , had cornered his father . He would have to say what he had come to dare Mr. Marks to say-crippled boy-and when he did , there it would be , the saddest goddamn thing . <p> But he hesitated , unable to bring up the words . He shifted his weight from one foot to the other as if the wheat stubble had suddenly poked through his shoe leather . Jackie thought how long a straw would have to be to penetrate the shoe on his own foot , the one with the built= up heel , the thick sole . He could n't bear the way his father danced about and could n't find his voice . <p> Finally , Jackie told Mr. Marks , " You said I 'm a crippled boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was something about the fact that Jackie had said the words himself-said them simply and with no hint of judgment-that cooled the heat that had been building between his father and Mr. Marks . Jackie could see it right away . He saw it in the way Mr. Marks closed his pocketknife and wrapped his hand around it and made it disappear . He saw it in the way his father glanced back over his shoulder to their car , idling in the lane , as if he were now anxious to leave . <p> Eugene leaned over and spit an orange seed , one that Mr. Marks had missed , onto the ground . " You had n't ought to have said that about Jackie , " he told his father , and Jackie saw Mr. Marks 's knuckles whiten on the hand closed around the pocketknife . Jackie wished , then , that he had kept quiet . Eugene had been sitting there in the cool shadows enjoying the sweetness of the orange , and then Jackie had said what he had , and everything had soured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and Mr. Marks told him to hush . <p> " I mean it , Eugene . " Mr. Marks reached down with his free hand and snapped off a fistful of wheat stubble . " Do n't be poking at me . Not tonight . I 'm burning a short fuse . " <p> Jackie 's father took a step toward Mr. Marks , and Mr. Marks rose to meet him . " You pay me that money you owe , " Jackie 's father said . " You pay me by the end of the week , or I 'll make it rough for you . " <p> Mr. Marks poked the blunt tip of the pocketknife casing into Jackie 's father 's chest . " Mister , " he said , " you do n't know what rough is . " <p> " End of the week , " said Jackie 's father , and then he turned , and Jackie followed him back to their car . <p> It was the scent of the orange that Jackie remembered the next day when his father came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night Bob Marks had beat him with his fists . Jackie was in his room , but he could hear his father and mother talking on the porch . <p> " Cracked his skull , " his father said . " His own boy . I heard it in town . " <p> Jackie 's mother did n't answer right away , and when she did , it was in a whimper that chilled Jackie . He could imagine her at the moment when she first learned that he was crippled , and he understood that everything he felt when he spoke to himself in front of his mirror-goddamn gimp-belonged to his parents , too . <p> " We knew all about it , " his mother said . " We knew Bob Marks was whipping that boy . " <p> " A lot of people knew . It was n't just us . " <p> " Yes , a lot of us , and not one of us said a word . " <p> " Just Jackie . " <p> " And I told him not to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't we all ? How ugly can the world be and any of us still be able to stand it ? " <p> Jackie listened closely , not just to what his parents were saying but also to the silences around their words , to the shadows of breath . What he heard amazed him . He had no words for the feeling that came over him , but he recognized it from Eugene 's kiss on the playground , from the quiver in his stomach when he had touched the welt on Eugene 's leg , from the way his throat had filled when he had watched Mr. Marks feed Eugene that orange . It was theirs now , Jackie thought-his and his mother 's and his father 's . This trembling . <p> " Sweet Jesus , " he whispered in Eugene 's rasp and lisp . <p> He listened to the screen door creak open and then close with a faint tap against the jamb . He heard his parents ' footsteps on the stairshis mother 's light scuff , his father 's heavy tread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sweet Jesus , " he said again , this time in a voice so full he knew it could be no one 's but his own . <p> Author Affiliation
