<p> WETUMPKA , Ala.  --  Ask Fannie Mae Sanders what landed her in this whitewashed compound called Tutwiler Prison , and she 'll tell a story that would be unbelievable  --  if it were n't part of the state court record . <p> Twenty years ago , she and a boyfriend lured her wheelchair-bound husband , Larry , to the banks of the Choctawhatchee River and threw him in . They watched as he hit the water , screaming for help . <p> " He was sinking , " she says now , stifling a giggle . " I watched him swallowing water , and then the river swept him away . One part of me said , ' Help him . ' The other part said , ' Screw him . ' " <p> But ask Sanders  --  now 46 and two decades removed from society  --  what she plans to do when she is released from prison in about 90 days , and her expressive face goes blank . <p> Beyond satisfying a craving for oysters and crabmeat , she has no clue . The $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way out of prison will barely pay for that first meal . And though the state also provides a bus ticket , she does n't know where she wants to go . Returning to her family is n't an option , and she has no real skills to speak of , even if you count the prison certificate she earned for learning how to operate a microwave oven . <p> " I 'm hoping for a miracle , " she says . <p> It might take one . " I 'd give her a 50-50 chance " of making it on the outside , assistant warden Gladys Deese says . " That 's if she lives . " <p> The Alabama prisoner 's plight would be easy to ignore , if only because of her absence of remorse . " He deserved to die , " she says of her husband . However , it 's impossible to ignore the unprepared ex-cons like her who are streaming out of the USA 's prisons . <p> More people are leaving prison after completing their sentences than at any time in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 . <p> The trend is expected to continue for at least the next two years , Justice Department officials say , as more than 500,000 inmates leave each year . Eighty percent will be supervised by probation or parole officers . The rest , including Sanders and roughly 100,000 others , will be freed with no strings attached , having served their sentences . <p> Cells wo n't go vacant , however , as more people are sentenced to new prison terms . <p> State prisons held 1.2 million inmates at the end of 1998 . Prisoners are serving longer sentences : In 1998 , the average stay was 27 months compared with 22 months in 1990 . <p> In light of sharp cuts in prison rehabilitation and education programs , and longer , more punitive prison terms , officials are becoming increasingly concerned about what awaits communities that will have to absorb a disoriented and unprepared population of former inmates . <p> " Their emotions are jagged . The stress of simple social interaction is overwhelming , " says Stuart Grassian , a Harvard psychiatrist who has studied prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prison who are totally incapable of managing themselves . " <p> Little rehabilitation <p> Over the past several years , funding for prison education and work programs designed to ease the transition from incarceration to freedom has been cut or remained stagnant , according to the American Correctional Association . In 1994 , prisoners were barred from receiving federal money to pursue college credit . <p> All of these changes have consequences , authorities say . <p> If statistics are any guide , 62% of the people who leave prison will be rearrested on felony or major-misdemeanor charges within three years of release , the Justice Department says . Forty percent of those arrested will find themselves back inside prison walls . <p> Elected officials and law enforcement authorities have responded to this extraordinary cycle of failure by pushing for even longer prison terms . Locking up criminals for longer periods of time , they argue , is one of the main reasons crime rates have dropped sharply in the past five years . <p> But authorities acknowledge there has been little consideration of what awaits inmates upon their release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conditions of these people who are walking out of prison , " Grassian says . <p> A counter job at McDonald 's is going to be a challenge for many , says Marc Mauer , assistant director of the Sentencing Project , based in Washington , D.C. , which analyzes criminal justice policy . " Operating a cash register is going to involve learning new technology . The most humane wardens have made it clear that there is n't much available anymore in resources for rehabilitation . " <p> Anticipating the return to society of a large and troubled prison population , Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce today the formation of " re-entry courts " in nine states across the country . <p> Communities in California , Colorado , Delaware , Florida , Iowa , Kentucky , New York , Ohio and West Virginia have been selected to manage new programs aimed at linking inmates to housing , jobs and mental-health services before their release . Based on the successful drug court programs in operation throughout the country , the projects will get technical assistance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the earliest . Reno is banking on the projects ' success by requesting $ 60 million in the 2001 budget . <p> In drug courts , individual judges offer offenders an alternative to prison . They are given assistance in finding housing , employment and medical treatment for addiction . In the hundreds of jurisdictions where drug courts now exist , they are credited with substantially reducing recidivism . <p> Next month , the Justice Department is convening a meeting of officials from eight states  --  Nevada , Washington , Vermont , Maryland , Missouri , South Carolina , Florida and Massachusetts  --  to evaluate all the problems inmates face as they re-enter society . Part of that review will involve tracking dozens of newly released prisoners as they go back into the community . <p> " It 's shocking how little we know about this process , " says Jeremy Travis , director of the Justice Department 's research arm , the National Institute of Justice . Under current conditions , Travis says , communities are assuming a big public safety risk as thousands of former prisoners stream back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For most , " he says , " the process of reintegration will follow a rocky path : Their families may not be willing to accept them back . Finding jobs will be difficult , and individuals in their old peer groups will be ready to support the resumption of criminal habits . " <p> Maintaining some tether to family is important for prisoners . But in reality , that link is often difficult to maintain . <p> ' Mean as a snake ' <p> What faces Fannie Mae Sanders might be a case study for what the nation can expect from inmates who leave prison after a lengthy term . <p> From the first day of her prison term , the Ozark , Ala. , native was nothing but trouble , prison officials say . She spent much of the past five years in solitary confinement  --  for her own protection  --  because she kept informing on other inmates . She made many enemies and was the trigger for more than a few fights . <p> Except for the times when someone came to Tutwiler Prison to tell her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since she 's had a good , meaningful visit with anyone from her family . <p> While she 's been inside , her mother , a sister and her brother have died . <p> Each time , she was allowed to attend the funeral in the company of police . She is grateful for that . But the infrequent contact with her surviving family , including a 31-year-old son , a 29-year-old daughter and six grandchildren , has made her a stranger in her hometown . <p> That town , Ozark , also is home to some potential enemies . The surviving relatives of the husband she helped murder still live there . <p> " I do n't know those people anymore , " she says of her relatives . " That 's why I 'm not going back . " <p> But where the state-issued bus ticket will take her  --  and what she 'll do for support  --  are mysteries . <p> Maybe she could find work as a seamstress , she says . She helped make prison uniforms and bed linens in the prison factory . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe I could be a secretary . " <p> Tutwiler offers inmate training in auto mechanics , cosmetology , sewing , food service , floral design and basic office skills , as well as high school equivalency courses . But assistant warden Deese says Sanders rarely took advantage of the training . <p> After 20 years in prison  --  a term that cost the state about $ 200,000  --  Sanders says her main concern when she steps outside on May 23 is to " maintain my sanity . " <p> Could she murder again ? <p> " I could do a lot of things , " she says . " I feel like I could still do something like that . I 'm not going to lie to you . " <p> William " Buddy " Matthews Jr . knows that 's no lie . The former Dale County , Ala. , prosecutor who put Sanders away says he will never forget her . <p> He says she was responsible for putting her husband in the wheelchair in the first place three years before . She shot him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says . She claims he was abusing her . But she escaped a lengthy prison stay then when her paralyzed husband pleaded for her freedom so she could care for him . <p> " She 's one bloodthirsty gal , mean as a snake , " Matthews says . " I hope she does n't come back here . "
