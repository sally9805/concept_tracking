TEEN SNIPER When I reach the rooftop , I pull the dustcovers off my rifle scope and head for a folding chair leaned up against an air-conditioning unitright where I left it the last time I was up here . Sitting down , I have a clear view across a courtyard of lawns and fountains to Hewlett Packard . I line up a couple breakfast burritos on the parapet wall , in case this is a long one , and I crack a can of Nix . Most of us drink Nix because of how other sodas make you twitchy . I dial in my optics by focusing on flowers in the distance , impatiens and pansies , mostly , and I 'm tuning the rangefinder when I get the go-ahead from Lt. Kim . " Blackbird , " Lt. Kim says over the radio , " at your leisure , " which is code for the fact that the hostage negotiations are failing and it 's time to get to work . There 's a tone in her voice , though , that kind of sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector , where the " real money " is . I 'll admit I sometimes daydream on the job , but I 'm trying to better the community , so it 's like , get off my back already . I sweep my scope along the flowers a little longerthere 's a giant H formed from orange poppies and a P of velvety petunias . One of the perks of being a police sniper in Palo Alto , aside from the satisfaction you get from serving the public , is the serious commitment these software companies show toward floral displays , toward making the world a more beautiful place . I shoot over flowers every day . I fix the bipod of my Kruger Mark VI and chamber a round . The Kruger 's an old South African rifle , made in the gravy days of long-boreballistics , but the scope is state of the art , a fully digital Raytheon with cellular live-feed , so that it 's a camera , phone , and radio , all in one . That means Lt. Kim can see and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street , but it 's my shoulder she 's usually looking over . I 'm one of the best shots in the worldI mean , I have the gift . I 've been lead sniper for over a year , but Lt. Kim ca n't get past the fact that I 'm only fifteen . The target is a Pakistani guy over in HP 's think tank . He 's wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt that says " Cherry Garcia , " and he 's pacing back and forth in a cubicle decorated only with an Aladdin movie poster . The guy 's pretty worked up , yelling into the phone , probably to Gupta , our communications officer . In the poster , Aladdin 's hauling ass on his magic carpet with his little monkey friend , and there 's an evil genie hot on his tail . There 's no hostages that I can see , only about 475 meters of open courtyard between me and Cherry G. The shot will be a tricky one : the bullet will become wobbly and transient as it moves through different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , diving as it crosses cool , shady lawn , and finally tumbling through the rising humidity of a man-made lake . To the west , Cedric and Henry are dragging their heavy , water-cooled magnum into position atop a Jamba Juice , while across the way , Twan climbs a cellular tower , a sleek rifle equipped with satellite-assisted targeting dangling behind him on a rope . The satellite rifle is essential when the fog rolls in , and Twan is just the man to operate ithe 's got the cool , the confidence , to fire on faith into a blanket of white . That dude is smooth , and it has nothing to do with the color of his skin . Lt. Kim tends to only hire African Americans for my team . I think it 's because they had it bad for a long time , and we need to make it up to them . Snipers in general take pride in not discriminating . I 'm calculating the crosswind when Lt. Kim calls back . " Tell me how you 're feeling about the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I can hear her sipping tea in the command van , waiting for a response , while in the background , Gupta is negotiating his ass off in Urdu , though I do make out the word pizza . " Maybe let 's talk about it later , " I tell her . I know the guys are listening , and I 'm gon na get some razzing about " my feelings " in the locker room . " Do you want to try a few visualizations ? " she asks . " Just leave me alone , all right ? " I radio in , trying not to let my voice crack , which is a problem lately . Lt. Kim 's one of those sniper commanders who also has an MSW , so she 's always all over my emotions . I 've been having some dreams , I 'll admit , and we 've been working on replacing bad images with good ones . Flowers are supposed to be my replacement images . I ease my eye back into the scope . Even when Cherry G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this distance , and the crosshairs , flinching with my pulse , skip across his body . The only way to get closer to him would be to belly crawl through a hundred meters of flowers , but I do n't think I could handle sneaking through bed after bed of what 's supposed to be my positive imagery . " Yo , homies , " I say into my scope . " Who 's calling the shot ? " I try to talk cool to the guys , you know , to work on our unity . From his perch on the tower , Twan just grunts . Henry is huffing and puffing when he calls in . " We 've got a decent shot , " he says , running out of breath . " Probably seventy percent . " He 's working the foot pedals of the huge twenty-millimeter magnum while Cedric aims . Like me , Cedric and Henry came out of the target-match circuit , with Cedric riding a full sniper scholarship to BYU and Henry touring Asia for Team Adidas . But Twan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland , and like they say , the Lord looks out for left-handed snipers . Twan 's an ayatollah with a rifle , completely composed , but he 's touch-and-go as a police officer because he refuses to shoot women . Any of us could probably make the shot , but I do n't want to look like a puss in front of the guys . Besides , not that I 'm stuck up or anything , but I 'm the one with the gift . I won the Disney Classic at age eleven , scored a perfect one thousand at the North Hollywood Open , and took gold in the summer Sniptathalon in Bonn , all before thirteen . I flip down my clip-on shades and take aim . Sometimes , when I look through my scope , I am overwhelmed by the illusion that I know this stranger in the crosshairs in an essential way , like we 're old friends , like you can see their soul . This effect is known as " flash empathy . " The LAPD has conducted a lot of field studies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reptilian part of our brain and ca n't be avoided . You just got to turn a cold shoulder to it . Luckily , we have these new Raytheon scopes , which make it so you 're not actually looking at the dudeit 's just a video image . Sunglasses help . " Blackbird has the shot , " I announce and begin my positive visualization , which Lt. Kim says gives my mind a newer , more optimistic vocabulary for violence . A slug to the chest resembles a dwarf rose blossom , for example , so I would try to think of that . The head produces a pink mist of baby 's breath . If you 've ever seen the maroonish-green bloom of a chocolate beauty , then you 'll know when you clip the liver . Exit wounds in general are trailing vines of red , kind of tangled and groping , like the new chutes of a spring hibiscus . Finally , I do the math . At this distance , the slug will drop thirty centimeters , and the way the poppies are leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train my crosshairs above Cherry G and to the right , making it look like my target is really the skinny monkey with the fez on the Aladdin poster . Then it hits me , this feeling that I really know this guy . In the rinsed color of my video scope , I study the tinsely lines of sweat coming from his brow , the flush of anguish in his skin . In a flash , I see a guy who left his culture and traveled around the world , only to become a hopeless outcast . His words are always a little off , and maybe the people make fun of him because he looks different and ca n't dress so good . Forget about the girls . It 's like , because of your job , you have to leave your old friends behind , and then your new friends are always saying things to keep you down . You work side by side with them , and you 're really trying , but it 's like you 're not even there . They never ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restaurant and spot one of them , but they do n't even see you . You overhear them talking about some new movie , and it 's a movie you want to see , andI stop myself , try to get a grip . Like the LAPD says , this is n't real . I shift my aim toward the little monkey , and start my countdown . Here 's where the gift comes in : the secret to being a world-class sniper is knowing how to stop your heart . I exhale , my chest goes quiet , and there 's a ghostly feeling of serenity in my limbs . The rifle seems to just settle into its purpose , and things feel clear and flat in the scope . There 's a hollow crack , and for a second , the time it takes for the spent shell to spring and glint to the ground , Cherry G and I will both be lifeless . Duck , you fool , I ca n't help whispering . The slug goes , connectsa neck shot , my trademark , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target 's knees go out , and he falls from view , dropping into the beige of his cubicle . " Morning has broken , " I radio in . " Copy that , people , " Lt. Kim announces . " Blackbird has spoken . " Back at the police station , I slip in through the side door and take the back way , around the squash courts , toward the locker room . I 'm supposed to debrief with Lt. Kim after every assignment , but I 'm just not into talking about it today . She 's been worried about my " problems with intimacy , " which she always drags back to the fact that my mother 's a classic " sniper mom " who shuttled me around to every child firearms contest there was . And I 'd be on psych leave for a zillion years if I ever told Lt. Kim about the shrine my dad built out of all his second-place shooting trophies . I run into my team in the hallway . They 're standing next to a soda machine , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do n't get many gigs because they all play bass . Eyes closed , Cedric holds two fingers to his ear while Henry and Twan sing backup , snapping their fingers . It 's an old love ballad . " Pardon , mon cheri , " Cedric sings . Snap . Snap . " Why you rebukin ' me ? " Twan jumps in with the chorus ; he 's a large man with a booming voice . " Ce soir , ce soir , " Twan sings . " Girl , you 're having me . " I never thought much of French , but it sounds tough coming from these guys . " Word up , " I say . Twan stops mid-snap when I say this . " That French is phat , " I say . " Bet the lady friends go for that smooth talk . " That 's when ROMS rolls up . ROMS sniffs us , then lifts a claw in greeting . " Yo , holmses , " he says , which is something I taught him . ROMS is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's a bomb detection and disposal robot . He 's got some basic hostage negotiating programming , so I 've been trying to teach him to talk cooler . " Hey , ROMS , " I say . " The posse and me was thinking about grabbing some chow . Wan na chill with us ? " " Let 's eat and make friends , " he announces . " Food is the first step in peaceful resolutions . Pizza , burger , baba ghanoush . " " Shit , " Twan says and just walks away . " Maybe another time , sir , " Cedric says , and Henry looks like he wants to bust a stitch something 's so funny . " It 's a date , " ROMS says to them as they walk away . ROMS is clueless to how the guys are always avoiding him , and I try to shield him from that . You see , ROMS and I are both Cancers , which means we 're sensitive and a little moody , but with a lot to say . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him an updateNegotiator 5.0 , with the latest Black English Convertersbecause ROMS wants to express himself , but he just does n't have the programming . For now , ROMS and I decide to eat lunch without those guys . I have a learner 's permit , but there has to be someone in the car with me , and technically , ROMS does n't count , so we walk across the street to grab a Sony burger . Generally , people do n't like to see a bomb robot enter the building , so ROMS and I use the drive-thru , which is a little humiliating . The ugly truth is , though , robots are way looked down upon in our society . Just because some people are different does n't mean they 're not the same as you or me . That 's why , when we 're working at a playground or day care , I tie a " Barney " mask on ROMS 's display panelpurple and humorous , it helps ensure the next generation wo n't have to live in fear . I order a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I get a water , no iceyou have to wet his sponge reservoir every once in a while to keep his sniffer from drying out . The girl at the drive-thru 's kind of cute . She 's about my age , with some skin trouble , though I like the cock of her headset . When it 's our turn in line , I ca n't think of anything to say , but she 's the one who speaks first . " Nice rifle , " she says when she hands me the bag . I want to make my move , but ROMS wo n't quit sniffing her , and he 's ruining everything ! I kick him on the sly . When I do open my mouth , all that comes out is " extra ketchup . " Then I go and add , " s'il vous plat . " She shakes her head and hands me two packets , like there 's a ketchup shortage or something . The car behind us starts honking , so ROMS and I move along . The only place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dinky seat , and ROMS parks on the rumpus pad . The play area 's really just a giant food recycler dressed up to look like a jungle gym , and the thing 's loud as heck . I look past the little rope that 's supposed to keep kids out of the heavy gears , but I do n't see a muffler on the thing , a total code violation . I sift through the fries for my instant game card , while ROMS pulls out a really long straw . I get excited when I scratch off a bikini and then a martini , but it turns out I 'm one machete short of winning the trip to Haiti with the Sony Girls . I throw the game card on the ground . What 's the use , anyway ? ROMS can see my disappointment . " Why the long face ? " he asks " Thanks , ROMS , but I do n't want to talk about it . " " We can resolve this crisis together . We 're friends . First let 's start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Raiders this year ? " That puts a smile on my face . ROMS is my friend . Some bomb robots , every time you turn them on , you 're a new person to them . You have to reintroduce yourself and everything . But ROMS is different . We 're like a teamboth of us dedicated to saving people , though I do it indirectly , of course . " Okay , " I say . " Tell me thisyou ever find a bomb , and when you touch it , you get a feel for the person who made it , like , who they really are , and suddenly you 're connected to them ? " " All the time , " ROMS says , though it 's a little hard to hear him over the gnashing blades of the recycler . " I 'm versed in the signature detonation devices of most major terrorists . " " No , man . I mean , like , see their soul . " ROMS slurps . " Is this about the Sony Girls ? " he asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is way different . Say I 'm about to resolve a crisis , okay ? I go to pull the trigger , and I get this weird sense of connection with the target , like we 're old homies . But then , as soon as I shoot them , that closeness goes away , and I 'm left feeling sort of mechanical . " " I know where you 're coming from . I 've been there . " " Really ? " " I love you , man , " ROMS says . I chew a mouthful of hot dog , and looking at ROMS , wash it down with Nix . Because of his hostage skills , he always has something good to say when you 're down , but this surprises me . This is not in his programming . " Are you feeling okay ? " I ask ROMS . " Love makes the world go round , " he says and sniffles . I reach out , and his instrument shield is cool to the touch . When I check his power light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries are low , and his bomb sniffer resets to default , so that it sounds like he 's sniveling , like he 's about to cry . " Ca n't we all just get along ? " he asks me , his voice slow and slurred . Poor guy . I use my scope to call Maintenance to come pick him up . " Hugs , " ROMS mutters before all five of his arms droop , and he finally goes out .
