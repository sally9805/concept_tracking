Coraline Fairy Tales are more than true : not because they tell us that dragons exist , but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten  --  G.K. Chesterton . Chapter One Coraline discovered the door a little while after they moved into the house . It was a very old house  --  it had an attic under the roof and a cellar under the ground and an overgrown garden with huge old trees in it . Coraline 's family did n't own all of the house , it was too big for that . Instead they owned part of it . There were other people who lived in the old house . Miss Spink and Miss Forcible lived in the flat below Coraline 's , on the ground floor . They were both old and round , and they lived in their flat with a number of ageing highland terriers who had names like Hamish and Andrew and Jock . Once upon a time Miss Spink and Miss Forcible had been actresses , as Miss Spink told Coraline the first time she met her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting Coraline 's name wrong , " Both myself and Miss Forcible were famous actresses , in our time . We trod the boards , luvvy . Oh , do n't let Hamish eat the fruit cake , or he 'll be up all night with his tummy . " " It 's Coraline . Not Caroline . Coraline , " said Coraline . In the flat above Coraline 's , under the roof , was a crazy old man with a big moustache . He told Coraline that he was training a mouse circus . He would n't let anyone see it . " One day , little Caroline , when they are all ready , everyone in the whole world will see the wonders of my mouse circus . You ask me why you can not see it now . Is that what you asked me ? " " No , " said Coraline quietly , " I asked you not to call me Caroline . It 's Coraline . " " The reason you can not see the Mouse Circus , " said the man upstairs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , they refuse to play the songs I have written for them . All the songs I have written for the mice to play go oompah oompah . But the white mice will only play toodle oodle , like that . I am thinking of trying them on different types of cheese . " Coraline did n't think there really was a mouse circus . She thought the old man was probably making it up . The day after they moved in , Coraline went exploring . She explored the garden . It was a big garden : at the very back was an old tennis court , but no-one in the house played tennis and the fence around the court had holes in it and the net had mostly rotted away ; there was an old rose garden , filled with stunted , flyblown rose-bushes ; there was a rockery that was all rocks ; there was a fairy ring , made of squidgy brown toadstools which smelled dreadful if you accidentally trod on them . There was also a well . Miss Spink and Miss Forcible made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the first day Coraline 's family moved in , and warned her to be sure she kept away from it . So Coraline set off to explore for it , so that she knew where it was , to keep away from it properly . She found it on the third day , in an overgrown meadow beside the tennis court , behind a clump of trees  --  a low brick circle almost hidden in the high grass . The well had been covered up by wooden boards , to stop anyone falling in . There was a small knot-hole in one of the boards , and Coraline spent an afternoon dropping pebbles and acorns through the hole , and waiting , and counting , until she heard the plopas they hit the water , far below . Coraline also explored for animals . She found a hedgehog , and a snake-skin ( but no snake ) , and a rock that looked just like a frog , and a toad that looked just like a rock . There was also a haughty black cat , who would sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would slip away if ever she went over to try to play with it . That was how she spent her first two weeks in the house  --  exploring the garden and the grounds . Her mother made her come back inside for dinner , and for lunch ; and Coraline had to make sure she dressed up warm before she went out , for it was a very cold summer that year ; but go out she did , exploring , every day until the day it rained , when Coraline had to stay inside . " What should I do ? " asked Coraline . " Read a book , " said her mother . " Watch a video . Play with your toys . Go and pester Miss Spink or Miss Forcible , or the crazy old man upstairs . " " No , " said Coraline . " I do n't want to do those things . I want to explore . " " I do n't really mind what you do , " said Coraline 's mother , " as long as you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and watched the rain come down . It was n't the kind of rain you could go out in , it was the other kind , the kind that threw itself down from the sky and splashed where it landed . It was rain that meant business , and currently its business was turning the garden into a muddy , wet soup . Coraline had watched all the videos . She was bored with her toys , and she 'd read all her books . She turned on the television . She went from channel to channel to channel , but there was nothing on but men in suits talking about the stock market , and schools programmes . Eventually , she found something to watch : it was the last half of a natural history programme about something called protective coloration . She watched animals , birds and insects which disguised themselves as leaves or twigs or other animals to escape from things that could hurt them . She enjoyed it , but it ended too soon , and was followed by a programme about a cake factory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father was home .
