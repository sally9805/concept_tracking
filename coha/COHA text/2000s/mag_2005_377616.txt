Roy Guzman found himself in an educational no-man's-land . A bright , industrious teen who came to Miami from Honduras nine years ago , he scored well enough on his SAT that he was being recruited by Stanford University . But despite the tuition aid he could have received , Guzman felt that he and his family were n't ready for the heavy financial burden of four years at a prestigious college . And despite his good grades , Guzman was worried that he was n't ready academically either . <P> But just as he was about to delay college and join the Marines , Guzman heard that Miami Dade College , one of the largest community colleges in the U.S. , had created an honors college offering an advanced , university-level core curriculum that would allow him to fine-tune his skills and do it without having to pay Stanford 's $29,847 tuition . Now in his second and final year at Miami Dade , Guzman , 19 , is as confident as a Connecticut preppy about tackling Stanford or an Ivy League college next year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing , " he says . " But now I wo n't be wondering if I 'm just filling a minority enrollment quota . I 'll know for sure that I 'm ready to take on those schools ' requirements . " <P> Guzman has taken advantage of the fact that community colleges  --  the democratic , blue-collar institutions of U.S. higher education in the 20th century  --  are trying on more upscale caps and gowns in the 21st . They 're still a bargain ; a year of tuition and fees at Miami Dade runs about $3,000 . But more than a third of the 1,157 community colleges in the U.S. have developed some kind of honors program designed to attract higher-quality students and professors . As cash-strapped states cap enrollment at public universities  --  despite a rise in the number of 18-year-olds  --  community- college honors programs offer talented students a respectable place to start their higher education . As a result , the median age of community-college students has dropped , from 27 in 1990 to 23 today . <P> But does the greater academic cachet betray the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedial undergrads and midlife career switchers ? The honors college at Miami Dade uses less than $1 million of the school 's $643 million budget . But its approximately 400 students , who all get scholarships , enjoy an enviable student-professor ratio of less than 15 to 1 , compared with about 25 to 1 for regular students . And while more than 80% of Miami Dade 's honors students are black or Latino , students in similar programs at other community colleges have been predominantly white females . " We have to be careful that in the scramble for prestige we do n't lose our most important focus  --  open access , " says Richard Romano , director of the Institute for Community College Research at SUNY/ Broome Community College in Binghamton , N.Y . But Miami Dade president Eduardo Padrn argues that " it is unfair to restrict community colleges to that traditional role and allow only the four-year colleges or research universities to teach more lite students . " Having these more ambitious scholars on campus , he says , creates a " motivational role model " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
