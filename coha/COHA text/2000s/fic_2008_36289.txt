New Orleans Present Day <p> " It 's a bone , " Dr. Jon Abel announced . <p> " Obviously , " Aidan Flynn noted dryly . <p> The doctor shot him a glance . " A thighbone . " <p> " And it 's human , " Aidan said . <p> " Yes , it 's a human thighbone , " Dr. Abel agreed . He stood on the muddy bank at the side of the Mississippi and shrugged , looking at the faces around him . It was heading toward evening , but it had been a hot , sultry day , and only the breeze coming off the river hinted that a cooling-down was coming . Beyond the muddy shore where Aidan had found the bone , the churning water was an ugly shade of brown . A mosquito buzzed nearby , and the doctor slapped at his arm and shook his head in disgust . He 'd never been much for working out in the field . <p> Aidan was the one who had asked that he be called out , but since Aidan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his two brothers , had just inherited the old family plantation , it was Hal Vincent , parish homicide , who had actually placed the call . Jonas Burningham , local FBI , had attached himself to the " case , " such as it was , too , in case they were looking at a serial murderer taking advantage of the disorder-and all too often violence-left in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . <p> " You know , " Abel said , " we 're still finding all kinds of ... remnants stirred up by the storm . That 's going to go on for years . We did n't always bury aboveground here , and there are plenty of old family plots along the river . Down in Slidell , there was a woman who had three coffins in her yard for months after the storm . No one knew where they belonged , and she could n't get any agency to come get them , so she just called them Tom , Dick and Harry , and said hello to them every time she came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of about forty-five who looked more like a mad scientist than what he really was : one of the most respected medical examiners in the state . He looked out at the brown water . And sighed . " Hell , that river has seen more bodies than you and I could ever begin to guess , and it would take a dozen lifetimes to sort them all out . " <p> " That 's it ? " Aidan asked him . " No investigation ? You 're just going to dismiss it out of hand ? " As he spoke , the sky darkened . Storm clouds , only hinted at earlier in the day , were boiling into great menacing shadows across the heavens . He pointed at the bone . " Looks to me like there 's still some tissue on it , which means it 's fresh and there might be more body parts somewhere nearby to go with it . If I thought I 'd stumbled on something old , I 'd have called in an anthropologist . " <p> Jon Abel sighed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet holes in them . Slashed to ribbons . Mangled in car accidents . Dead under a bridge somewhere . Sure . I 'll just take this thighbone that might have a bit of tissue on it and get right on it . " <p> " Jon , " Hal Vincent said quietly . " There might be something to this . I know your office is busy and you 've got a lot of pressing cases , but do what you can , huh ? " <p> " Male or female ? " Aidan asked . <p> " It 's just a bone right now . " <p> " Male or female ? - your best guess , " Aidan insisted . <p> The medical examiner shot him an aggravated look . <p> " Female , " he said . The man had been at it a long time . Unwilling participant in today 's proceedings or not , he was tops in his field . He adjusted his glasses and shook his head . " Offhand , I 'd say she stood about five-six . " He looked closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you anything else . Not even guessing . " <p> " I 'm guessing she 's dead , " Hal said dryly . <p> Jonas stepped in , trying to keep things civil . Jonas was a definite " suit . " At forty , he was tall and hard-bodied , with slick tawny hair and attractive features . Even in the muck , he looked impeccable and unflappable . " We 'd deeply appreciate it , Dr. Abel , if you can tell us more as soon as your schedule will allow . Look , Jon , we know you 're busy . We also know you 're the best . " <p> Jon Abel grunted in acknowledgment of the compliment , but he cast Aidan a look of irritation . As far as he was concerned , Flynn was an outsider . He came to New Orleans often to see friends here , but he was still an outsider-at least to Jon Abel . <p> Aidan had been in the area this time because of a missing persons case . Runaway teens had taken to camping out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd found the subject of his search , and she 'd been dirty enough , wet enough , hungry enough and miserable enough to be grateful that her parents wanted her home . <p> And Aidan had been grateful that he 'd found her alive . That was n't always the case with runaways . And maybe not for the woman whose bone he 'd found nearby , either . <p> Jonas and Flynn went back a long way . They 'd gone through the FBI Academy together . Jonas had stayed with the Bureau . <p> After a few years , Aidan had n't . <p> It was mainly Jon 's friendship with Jonas that had brought him out here today . <p> " I 'll do what I can , " Jon said . He lifted a hand to his assistant , Lee Wong , who had been listening attentively to everything going on . He meant to go places , and working with Jon Abel was the way to do it . <p> The thighbone was duly tagged and bagged ; then , grumbling to himself , Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved goodbye and spoke without turning back to them . " I 'll get back to you when I know something . " <p> When he was gone , Hal Vincent spoke again . " I 'll get a few men out here to search the area . " He was a tall man , a good six-four or five , and thin , but every inch of him was muscled . His skin was copper and his eyes were green ; his hair had gone white , and he wore it cropped close to his head . His age was indeterminate , and Aidan thought that when he was a hundred years old , he would n't look much different . Born in Algiers , Louisiana-right across the river-he knew the area like the back of his hand . He was a good man , solid , no bullshit . <p> " Thanks , Hal , " Jonas told him . He looked at Aidan and shrugged . " You know ... that might actually be ... an old bone . " <p> " Yeah , it might be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pointed out , " it might not . " He tried to keep any hint of sarcasm out of his voice . <p> " We 'll search , and let you know . " Hal looked at his watch . " I 'm off duty as of now , and I could use a beer . Anyone want to join me ? " <p> " Sounds good to me , " Jonas said . He 'd wanted to be assigned out west , but he 'd drawn New Orleans instead , then surprised himself by falling in love with the place . He 'd ended up marrying a local girl and moving to the French Quarter . " Aidan ? " <p> Aidan shook his head . " Sorry . I 'm late already . I have to meet my brothers downriver . " <p> " I heard you boys inherited the old place out on the Mississippi , " Hal asked . <p> Aidan grimaced . " Yeah , it 's quite an inheritance . " <p> " You never know , " Hal told him . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legend , ghosts , the whole bit . It 's decaying , but does have the original stables , smokehouse- even the slave quarters . If you want to do something with it , do it fast . The local preservationists will be all over you any day now . " <p> " Yeah , well ... I do n't know what we 're doing . That 's part of what we 're meeting up to decide , " Aidan said . <p> " I heard the three of you went into the private investigation business together , " Jonas said . " How 's that working out ? " <p> " Well , " Aidan said briefly . <p> " Floridians . Taking on that old house , " Hal said . How he meant it , Aidan was n't sure . " Let 's get that beer , Jonas . Aidan , we 'll be in touch if we hear anything about that bone of yours . " <p> Aidan nodded , and they all trekked back through the muck . When they reached their cars , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Aidan started down the river road . <p> Twenty minutes later , he was with his brothers . <p> And they stood , the three of them , staring at the house on the rise that was n't exactly a hill . <p> Then again , the building was n't exactly a house . Not anymore . Decades of neglect had left dangling shingles , broken columns , and paint that was flaking and peeling . The effect was of something from a horror movie set . <p> The promise of a storm was n't helping , either . In the distance , thunder was rumbling , and the sky had turned a strange color . But at least the coming weather had alleviated the heat . A cool breeze was blowing . It actually had a slight chill to it . And the darkness seemed to have taken on a life of its own , sweeping across the sky and down over the trees , crawling like a fog along the ground , a shadow-mist that smelled of violence and decay . <p> Aidan was the oldest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an inch . His features were weathered , and he was the most physically imposing of them . A stint in the military had left him fit and wary ; his reflexes were quick , and he had retained a suspicious perception of the world around him and an invisible Keep Away sign . Once , he supposed , he had been decent-looking . He had blue eyes , referred to as " icy " these days , and pitch-dark hair . Serena had found him compelling enough . It was his manner rather than his appearance , he figured , that tended to keep people at a distance . Then again , he probably had n't been as remote and chilly when he had been with Serena . There had been promise in the world when she was alive . Now ... well , it was a good thing he had work to do . Lots of it . Keeping himself from falling into the emptiness . <p> His brothers , his family ... them , he trusted , but others ... He 'd gone through Quantico , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team player , he 'd left the FBI . Given his background , he had opted for private investigation . <p> Maybe he should have investigated the house . <p> " Hmm , " Jeremy , the second in age , said . Jeremy had been the first to suggest they form a business . When Aidan had left the Bureau , Jeremy had been ready to leave his position with the Jacksonville police divers . Unlike Aidan , his hell had n't been a personal one ; he had simply been the first to come upon a van full of abused foster children , drowned when their vehicle leapt a median and drove straight into the St. Johns River . He 'd been at it a long time ; he 'd seen horrific sights . But that one had haunted him . Jeremy loved playing his guitar , though , and music brought him through . He 'd quietly begun a charity to find homes for abused , abandoned and orphaned children , and discovered a talent for broadcasting along the way . He had come to New Orleans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held at the aquarium to raise funds for Children 's House , his charity , which was involved in finding homes for area children who had been orphaned by Katrina . <p> Jeremy liked people , and had always loved New Orleans and the Gulf region , but even he was speechless now that they were seeing their unexpected inheritance for the first time . <p> Plantation , Aidan thought . <p> The word summoned up visions of long , oak-shaded drives , rich and verdant fields , pastures-and a Greek Revival house painted pristine white , with beautiful women in long flowing dresses sitting on the porch sipping mint juleps . <p> If anyone were caught imbibing anything here , it would be derelicts chugging beer out of bottles hidden in brown paper bags . <p> Oh yeah . He definitely should have investigated . <p> Zachary , the youngest of the trio , who was a mixture of his eldest brother 's hard stoicism and his other 's open-mindedness , let out a breath . <p> " Well , I guess you could call it a fixer-upper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Zachary stood a half inch over six-two , just like Jeremy . It was as if the three brothers had been cast in the same mold , then painted in different shades . Aidan 's own eyes were a blue that varied from icy to almost as black as his hair . Jeremy 's eyes were cloud-gray , his hair a dark brown with a touch of auburn . As a kid , Zachary had fought to toughen up , because he 'd been born with strawberry-blond curls . The color had deepened as he aged , but that red tint remained . His eyes were almost aqua . Aidan and Jeremy had teased him mercilessly when they were young , but the truth was , he was as striking as a Greek god . He had grown up fighting-but then , as their mother had mourned frequently , there was a reason for the expression " fighting Irish . " Regardless , the years had been good for Zach . He could hold his own in any fight , but his first love had always been music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The soul 's solace , he called it . <p> He had been equally ready to opt into the family business . After years in the Miami forensics unit , he had hit his limit when he was called in after a crack addict dad had micro-waved his infant son . He had already acquired a part ownership of a number of small recording studios around the country , but when he had heard the plan to open an investigations office , the idea had intrigued him , and he immediately quit the force . <p> Aidan was thirty-six now , Jeremy thirty-five , and Zachary thirty-three . They 'd done a hell of a lot of fighting as kids , but as adults , they had grown into being friends . <p> " We should just sell it , " Aidan said . <p> " I 'm not real sure what we 'd get for it , in its present condition , " Zach pointed out . <p> " Sell it ? " Jeremy protested . " It 's our ... well , it 's our heritage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning . " Our heritage ? We did n't even know the placed existed until that lawyer called , " Aidan reminded him . <p> Jeremy shrugged . " Maybe so , but hey , a whole lot of Flynns lived in that house , and now it 's come to us . I think that 's cool . How many people wake up one morning and discover that they 've inherited an antebellum plantation ? " <p> Aidan and Zach stared at the house , then back at their brother . <p> " Come on , " Jeremy protested . " The land alone has to be worth something . " <p> " Right , " Aidan said . " So I say we should sell it for its land value . " <p> " No , we should do something with it , " Jeremy said , shaking his head . He stared intently at the house , rather than at his brothers . Then he turned to them at last . " What 's to keep us from moving to the area , huh ? " <p> Aidan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest , instead . <p> It was true . <p> He 'd come to New Orleans to hunt down a runaway teen . Now that he 'd done that , he 'd been intending to return to the place he 'd called home for some time now , Orlando , Florida . But why ? They could relocate the business anywhere they wanted , and without Serena , there was really nothing to tie him to Orlando . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
