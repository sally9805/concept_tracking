Wastewater-treatment plants are pretty good at getting rid of common pollutants like bacteria and heavy metals , but a nationwide survey last year showed that plenty of manmade chemicals still get through . U.S. rivers and streams are tainted with , among other things , pesticides , antibiotics and even common drugs such as aspirin and Prozac , flushed down drains and out into the water supply . The concentrations tend to be very low  --  less than one part per trillion , in some cases  --  but nobody can say for sure whether they 're low enough to be safe . <P> So the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) , which did last year 's study , is out in the field again this summer . Scientists are pouring nontoxic red dye into streams in Iowa and Colorado to study how water flow disperses pollutants . The next step , says Dana Kolpin , the research hydrologist who is coordinating the project , will be to go back and measure the concentrations of various drugs and industrial chemicals . Some of these substances , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  perhaps because they degrade quickly or bind to sediments in the stream bottom . Others may disperse more gradually , and those are the ones that treatment-plant operators should concentrate on removing . <P> Once they have figured out how the dozens of compounds on their list are dispersed , USGS and other scientists will address the question of how dangerous they are to human health  --  research that should take several more years . " We have no evidence that these chemicals are harmful at these levels , " says Kolpin . " But we also have no proof that they aren't. "  --  M.D.L.
