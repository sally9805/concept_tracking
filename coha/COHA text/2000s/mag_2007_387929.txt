Headnote Jesus gave us words with which to pray , but U.S. CATHOLIC readers have some wisdom of their own to share about how to come closer to God . // WHEN JESUS TAUGHT HIS DISCIPLES HOW TO pray 2,000 years ago , he knew what he was doing . With the Our Father he offered a prayer that satisfies the longings of his followers then and now . Rather than using " empty phrases , " Jesus addressed God in a personal way , as a father ( Matt. 6:7 ) . Today Catholics may address God as father , mother , or best friend , but the idea is the same-we have a relationship with God . More than anything else , U.S. CATHOLIC readers responded to our Reader Survey on prayer by saying that they pray in order to develop and strengthen this relationship . Could it really be as simple as Jesus suggests , these few lines uniting us with our Creator ? Perhaps it is , but we humans tend to complicate things , and this Reader Survey reveals that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT PRAYER IS ABOUT A PERSONAL RELAtionship with God is not so simple , as the line between individual and communal prayer is not dear cut . The church teaches us that prayer is " crucial to the Christ-life , both individually and communally , privately and liturgically , " writes Father Bob Meissner of Bay City , Michigan . It is indeed the Our Father rather than the My Father . This can pose a challenge , Meissner explains : " There are two unhealthy tendencies in prayer : 1 ) " All I need to do is pray in private , and I do n't need the church for that " ; 2 ) " Going to Mass is enough and satisfies my need and obligation to pray . ' " Most respondents , however , seem not to fall into either of these unhealthy camps . Eighty-six percent say they pray more than once a day , not just at Mass , and 72 percent say that Sunday Mass does not satisfy their needs for prayer . Many also list daily Mass , saying the rosary before Mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal prayer life . Even outside of Mass , prayer is often communal : Prayer or church groups , spiritual directors , teaching others , retreats , and family and friends all help readers with their own prayer lives . For Julianne Powers of Melrose , Massachusetts , for example , weekly meetings of a parish rosary group and a charismatic prayer group " encourage my own prayer life because of the dedication of the other members . " Also , while readers most frequently say prayer is about their personal relationship with God , they most often pray about or for others . U.S. CATHOLIC readers pray for the struggles of family and friends most of the time , and they often pray for people they do n't know , especially those who are forced to live through poverty and war . Although 74 percent say they pray in times of crisis or personal need , they list others ' needs more frequently than they list their own in what they pray for or about . ANOTHER SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY ASPECT of prayer is that people pray to come closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , whether their own health or world peace . God may be their best friend , but God is a best friend with a lot of power , and this can be troubling . Although Sandra Kay of Houston prays about her health and financial situation , as well as for her family and the world , she says that the formula of thanksgiving first and petitions last " seems manipulative even though I 'm sincere . " A few say that they avoid this problem altogether . " I do n't usually ask for things . My prayers are mostly of adoration and thanksgiving , " says Jack Coleman of Belmont , Massachusetts . Jesus does say , however , " Ask and it will be given to you " ( Luke 11:9 ) . Half of the Our Father prayer , too , is petitions . " Give us ... Forgive us ... Deliver us from evil , " we ask . " We do not have to talk God into doing good things for us , " Kathy Voigt of claysville , Pennsylvania points out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although almost all respondents say that God does answer at least some prayers , it can sometimes be hard to believe that God intervenes to do good for us . " The lack of response , and my own weak faith and skepticism " challenges Matt Legrand of Sacramento , California , but he does believe God answers prayers in ways he would n't expect . This idea helps many reconcile the tension between reverence and request . Rather than becoming closer to God because they want something , these readers become closer to God in order to understand God 's will . They pray for insight , inner peace , and forgiveness rather than outright solutions . A reader in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , for example , says she prays for " acceptance and guidance . I ask to see the path that God knows is best for me , and the courage to follow that path . " For these readers , it is as simple as the Our Father prayer suggests : We ask for our daily bread , but we also let God 's " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " HOW EXACTLY ONE LEARNS GOD 'S WILL IS ANOTHER STORY . Jesus gave us words with which to pray , and 65 percent of readers say they recite memorized prayers , like the Our Father , when praying . This has its limitations , however . " Memorized prayer , although good in itself and as a starting point , does not allow for our minds to quiet and be touched by the Spirit working within and through us , " says Joyce M. Potter of Fairbanks , Arkansas . This is also the problem with the most popular form of prayer-talking to God . Many readers find that with this approach to prayer , they sometimes talk too much . While 76 percent of respondents say they talk to God , only 55 percent say they listen . As Cindy Bourret of Baltimore says , " being silent and listening to God " is difficult , and other challenges listed by readers-like finding a quiet , distraction-free time and place-only make inner silence more difficult . Some say contemplative prayer , centering groups , or even Eastern practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tao Te Ching very helpful for meditation , " says Father David Sharp , C.S.B. of Wickenburg , Arizona . But only 8 percent of those surveyed have tried nontraditional prayers or prayers from other religions . OTHERS SUGGEST A DIFFERENT APPROACH . " PRAYER IS MORE than just finding a quiet time away . It is about finding God in the midst of daily living , " says Margaret Wilken of Saginaw , Michigan . To " pray always " throughout our day , as many readers suggest , is a daunting challenge-and one that makes it hard to be satisfied with one 's prayer life . Because prayer is an endless process , the most satisfying prayer life can still be frustrating . " My chief issue is finding patience with the pace of development in my prayer life while not becoming complacent and striving for improvement , " says Ricardo Rodriguez of Ypsilanti , Michigan . Despite the number of times a day and the variety of ways readers pray , only 45 percent say they are satisfied with their prayer life . Almost all readers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grand Junction , Colorado says he is OK where he is now , he also says , " My prayer life will hopefully always grow and mature . " In the face of challenges , it is good to remember that " God loves us " warts and all " even though our prayers are not perfect , " says Rita Patterman of Indianapolis . Most readers suggest simply finding whatever practice works for you-reciting the rosary , talking to God , or meditating in a quiet corner-and sticking with it . We may try to complicate it with our hopes and desires , but prayer , as Jesus taught us 2,000 years ago , seems to be pretty simple in the end . All the varied approaches come down to one thing : As so many readers suggest , borrowing a line from Nike , " Just do it .
