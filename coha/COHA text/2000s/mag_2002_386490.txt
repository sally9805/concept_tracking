Will this be the season that Stephen Sondheim grabs the popular recognition that he 's long deserved ? Bv Matthew Gurewitsch // " I 've always wanted to have a smash , but I rather doubt that I ever will , " Stephen Sondheim said in the mid1970s.Judging from their reviews , West Side Story ( 1957 ) and Gypsy ( 1959 ) - for which he wrote the lyrics-ought to have been smashes , Sondheim remarked , but smash hits spring from stories audiences want to hear , " and it 's always the same story : how everything turns out terrific in the end , and the audience goes out thinking , That 's what life is all about . " No , Virginia , that is not what most lives are about-neither real life nor life as mirrored in the musicals through which Sondheim has emerged as the most distinctive and influential songwriter of his age . In place of the smash , he got a halo . For decades now , Sondheim celebrations ( all-star galas , cabaret acts , star-studded full-evening anthologies ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes awarded by his fellow theater professionals in lieu of a really long run , which has yet to materialize . Now a remarkably youthful seventy-two , Sondheim has lived to see his star shine brighter than ever . Broadway has just rolled out the red carpet for a revival of Into the Woods , which accompanies Cinderella , Rapunzel , Little Red Riding Hood et al . into dark territory never charted by the Brothers Grimm . In Washington , D.C. , meanwhile , the Kennedy Center is revving up for an entire Sondheim season : Sweeney Todd ( the one about mass murder and cannibalism ) , Company ( commitment anxiety ) , Sunday in the Park With George ( Pointillism ) , Merrily We Roll Along ( selling out ) , Passion ( to put it mildly ) and A Little Night Music ( Ingmar Bergman sings ! ) , all major new productions rotating in repertory from May through August . ( For Kennedy Center information and tickets , call 800-444-1324 ; for Into the Woods , call 212-239-6200 . ) And for a chaser , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kabuki-style depiction of American gunboat diplomacy as seen through Japanese eyes , in a Japaneselanguage production by the New National Theatre of Japan . ( New Yorkers will get a preview of this one in July , courtesy of the Lincoln Center Festival . For information , call 212-875-5928 . ) The bounty adds up to eight of Sondheim 's seventeen Broadway shows back on the boards , and that 's not all . Gypsy , now an established classic , is due for a major Broadway revival next year , directed by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty , Cabaret ) , and starring Bernadette Peters . And , after a troubled workshop and a bitter lawsuit , his latest projectonce called Wise Guys , newly ( perhaps temporarily ) titled Gold ! - is on the drawing board again . Conceived , Sondheim has said , as " a romp through American history , " and centered on the once-celebrated Mizner brothers ( one an architect , the other a con man ) , the work reunites Sondheim and his longtime collaborator , the directorproducer Harold Prince , back in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades . Popular lore knows Sondheim as a touch-me-not , inaccessible to the press and often difficult company even in his closest circle . For deep background , consult his biographer Meryle Secrest , in whose pages Sondheim 's childhood reads like a nightmare that did not end when he grew to man 's estate . ( " The only regret I have in life , " his aged mother wrote him from a hospital bed , the night before surgery she hysterically thought she might not survive , " is giving you birth . " ) Add to this the professional frustrations of a serious artist in an art form that , as he has said , " is hardly worth being called one , " and the dark side of Sondheim 's subject matter more or less explains itself . But tread softly , dime-store Dr. Freuds . Sondheim 's vita has not been all bad . Friendships formed in youth have lasted a lifetime . Though still an emotional " boy in a bubble " at sixty-one , he then saw love walk in at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades his junior . Photographs of the artist across the years suggestalong , perhaps , with shyness-a deep capacity for irony and amusement , vulnerability rather than the coldness of which his work has often been accused . Lately , to the amazement of friends who have known him for decades , he has even been singing his own songs at parties.They are songs of hope and heartbreak . Good times and bum times , he 's seen them all , and my dear , he 's still here . In the end , of course , the songs are the thing . What sets them apart ? As Sondheim has often said , he thinks like an actor . The lyricist Oscar Hammerstein , virtually a godfather to the budding composer , brought him up to think of songs as " compressed scenes , " written for a specific character at a specific moment , with a specific dramatic agenda . ( Sometimes he may overshoot . Elaine Stritch , the original interpreter of " The Ladies Who Lunch , " calls the song " a three-act play . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're thinking like a playwright , " Sondheim says now , over the phone from his town house in New York City 's Turtle Bay , next door to Katharine Hepburn 's . " And most playwrights I know think of their characters from the inside out , once they get to know them , just as actors do . That 's how you explore character . Which brings us to the subject of subtext . Give the actor something to play , beyond what 's on the surface . " Note that the subject is words , not music . Note , too , that at the dawn of his Broadway career , when no one would hire him to write songs , Sondheim swallowed his pride and wrote lyrics for the use of other composers ( Leonard Bernstein for West Side Story , Jule Styne for Gypsy ) . Since A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ( 1962 ) , however , Broadway audiences have heard Sondheim 's words set to Sondheim 's music almost a dozen times ( though runs have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sondheim is quick to acknowledge , the scenarios into which he drops his songs-which is to say , from which they precipitateare nearly always a playwright 's , not his own . Over the years , book credits on his shows have gone to Burt Shevelove , Larry Gelbart , Arthur Laurents , James Goldman , Hugh Wheeler , John Weidman , James Lapine.Yet what promises to take a permanent place in the collective memory are the songs- " Comedy Tonight , " " Johanna , " " Children Will Listen , " " Loving You , " " Send in the Clowns " - not the characters who sing them or the books that inspired them . Hence , all those celebrations that focus on the composer . Those " compressed scenes " of his have assumed lives of their own . At seventy-four , Barbara Cook , Broadway 's reigning ingenue in the 1950s , is selling out concert halls and theaters from New York and London to Sydney , Australia , with her incandescent Mostly Sondheim program .

" Stephen is a seminal force , " she explains now . " He changed our theater the way Picasso changed art . " And like Picasso , he has come in for his share of resistance along the way . " People think of him as unsentimental , " Cook says . " I do n't think that 's true . But the way he expresses sentiment is never mundane . I 'll never tire of singing his songs . But until I actually started singing them , I thought of him as brainy , the way many people do . I saw the cleverness , not the emotion . And for a lot of people , it can take time to hear the melodies in his music . " On this point , as on others , Sondheim is philosophical . " Melody is in the ear of the beholder , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people walk out thinking any tune is hummable . ' " Time to move on . This afternoon , he 's off to a reading of Gold ! , which is due for an unveiling in a new , improved form , probably at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago , maybe next year . Will it be the smash he once longed for ? Who can tell ? But if the current Sondheim renaissance is any indication , the general audience is at last catching up with the connoisseurs . Maybe , just maybe , everything 's coming up roses . Is n't it rich ? When Sondheim coined that phrase , no one was sure that people would get it .
