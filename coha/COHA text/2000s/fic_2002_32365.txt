Curtains of Blood By Robert J. Randisi Dorchester Publishing Robert J. Randisi September 1 , 1888 From the back of the Lyceum Theatre Bram Stoker watched his friend , his idol , his employer , his Master , Henry Irving , transform brilliantly from the civilized Dr. Jekyll into the monstrous Mr. Hyde . As they had been doing every night since the play had began its run , the audience gasped in amazement . Stoker , too , reacted the same way . Irving 's performances continued to take his breath away as much as they had twelve years earlier , when he was the theater critic of the Evening Mail in Dublin . Now , at forty-one , he was no less taken with the man 's genius . However , since managing the Lyceum Theater was part of his duties , he could not afford to spend the time it would take to watch the entire performance . Once Irving made the first transformation Stoker turned and left . Strolling through the halls , he could smell the dinner which would be served immediately following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to the suite which once was the meeting place of the famed Beefsteakers Club . First formed in 1735 , members of the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks boasted actors , playwrights , poets , and other honored guests . It was Stoker who restored the Beefsteak Room to its former glory , he who chose the evening 's diners and set out the place cards-which was the task he was on his way to do now . As he entered the suite he admired the oak paneled walls and high-beamed ceilings . It was while Irving was on a Mediterranean cruise that Stoker had the room redone , in order to surprise the actor upon his return . Irving had wholeheartedly approved of everything , but insisted upon decorating the room . He did so with portraits of men he admired-David Garrick , William Charles Macready among them - and also Whistler 's full-length portrait of Irving himself as Philip II , and his favorite leading lady , Ellen Terry , as Lady Macbeth . It was this painting that dominated the room . The dining room was situated behind the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty old stairway that made it seem as if they were entering another age . The fact that the room was lined in old suits of armor lent credence to the fantasy . Stoker walked through the room and entered the kitchen , which he 'd had furnished with the most modern of equipment . The beef sizzled and spit on the new range . In the old days the white-coated cooks were in plain view of the diners , but now they worked in privacy . " How are we coming ? " Stoker asked Henry Boardman , the head chef . " How do we ever come , Guv ? " the man asked . " Everything will be perfect . " Stoker knew that the beef would be accompanied by giant baked potatoes , onions and other vegetables . Since Henry Boardman had been put in charge of the meals they had always been superb . Stoker looked at the broad-shouldered man who appeared more like a dockworker than a chef . He touched his red beard and said , " Of course . Silly of me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask every time ... Guv . " " So I do , Henry , " Stoker said , " so I do . I will be in my office until dinner . " " Yes , sir . " * * * Stoker 's office was a small affair , but he 'd had it furnished to his liking , all in dark wood and smooth surfaces . He was seated behind his desk , awaiting the end of the play , when there came a knock at the door . " Come in . " The door opened and Joseph Harker entered . The young man , along with William Telbin and Hawes Craven , was one of the Lyceum 's three scene painters . Harker was talented , but the thirty-three-year-old had been hired by Irving not because of his artistic ability , but rather in repayment of a favor . Harker 's father had hired an eighteen-year-old Irving when they were both at the Edinburgh Royal Theater . " Not watching the performance , Joseph ? " Stoker asked . " I was called away , " Harker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre looking for you , Bram . " It was soon after Harker was hired that Stoker convinced him not to call him " Mr. Stoker . " " When they could n't find you one of the ushers informed me of our visitors . " " Who ? " " Some policemen . " Stoker sat back in the chair and regarded Harker curiously . " What would the police want with me ? " " Shall I show them in so you can ask them yourself ? " " By all means . " He still had half an hour before the performance would end and guests began filing into the Beafsteak Suite . Harker withdrew and returned with two men in tow . One was his age , while the other one was younger , closer to Harker 's age , perhaps even a few years younger . The older man 's mode of dress and his demeanor-not to mention his age-pointed him out as the one in authority . " Mr. Stoker ? " he asked , approaching the desk . " I am Bram Stoker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the man said . " This is Sergeant Hobbs . " Stoker exchanged nods with Hobbs and shook hands with the Chief Inspector . " What can I do for you , sir ? " Stoker asked . " I was actually here to see Mr. Irving , " Swanson said , looking around . His eyes settled on Harker for a moment , then turned back to Stoker . " However , this gentlemen informed me that he was on stage at the moment . " " Yes . We 're doing Dr. Jekyll and Hyde , " Stoker said . " I see . Then perhaps I could wait for him to finish ? " " He will be on stage for another thirty minutes or so , " Stoker explained . " After that he dines with guests . Perhaps I could help you ? I manage the theatre . " He was much more than the theatre manager , but perhaps it was in this capacity he could help the policeman . " You might actually be the one I should speak to , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stoker said , " have a seat . " Swanson sat in a chair across from Stoker . Harker remained standing to one side of the door , and Hobbs on the other . " I 'm afraid I am the bearer of bad news . " " What sort of bad news ? " " Have you heard that another woman was killed ? " " No , " Stoker said . " Where ? " " Buck 's Row , in Whitechapel . " " How many does that make ? " " Three . " " And the killer ? " Swanson shrugged . " So he got away again ? " " Yes . " " Leaving not one clue ? " " We are investigating , sir . " Stoker frowned . " And your investigation has brought you to the Lyceum ? " Swanson looked unhappy . " I am here on direct orders from my superiors . " " To do what ? " " I 'm afraid-it 's to close you down . " " What ? " " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyceum ? " " Well , " Swanson said , without turning to acknowledge Harker . When he spoke it was directly to Stoker . " Not the theatre so much as the performance . " " You want us to stop doing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ? " " Not me-but that is essentially correct . You see , there are those who believe that this play might be ... inciting the killer to do what he has been doing . " " This is just a story , Inspector , " Stoker said , " a fiction , and a brilliant one , at that , but staged strictly for entertainment . True , it 's about one man 's battle with another , darker personality inside him , but ... " Swanson spread his hands . " This Whitechapel killer may be having the same problem . " " He 's a mad killer , " Stoker said . " There can be no comparison . " " I 've seen the play , Mr. Stoker , " Swanson said . " Mr. Hyde is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stoker said . " And it is he who is real ... within the context of the play , of course . " " Well , perhaps the same is true of this killer , " Swanson said , and then added , " within in the context of real life . " Stoker was becoming agitated . " But it 's ridiculous to blame a man 's crimes on ... on a play ! " " Believe me , " the Inspector said , " I made the same argument . It fell on deaf ears . My superiors believe what they want to believe . " " Out of fear , " Stoker said , " and ignorance . " " Exactly . " The Sergeant shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other . Hearing the Inspector agree with Stoker 's assessment of both their superiors tested his loyalty . " And these are the men who are trying to apprehend this crazed madman ? " " As am I , " Swanson said . " I am also trying to catch him , but they my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been solicited . " " Well , you 've delivered your news , " Stoker said . " What happens if we do not comply ? " Swanson looked pained . " In that event I 'm afraid the Lyceum would be shut down indefinitely . I would personally hate to see that happen , Mr. Stoker . My wife and I have spent many pleasant evenings here . " " You and your wife enjoy the theatre ? " " Immensely , " Swanson admitted . " Particularly Mr. Irving 's performances . " Stoker regarded the Inspector quizzically now . If he and his wife enjoyed Irving 's performances that meant the policeman knew in advance that a performance would be in process and Irving would be on stage now . Swanson had not had the heart to give the bad news directly to the actor . " Inspector , " Stoker said , " I would offer you and your wife free tickets to our next production , but I am unsure when that will be . " " Surely you can stage another play , " Swanson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complicated than that , sir , " Stoker said . " A lot of preparation goes into a production . And I fear Mr. Irving will to be too upset to think about it for a while . " " I 'm genuinely sorry , Mr. Stoker . " " I believe you , sir . " Stoker took a deep breath and let it out slowly , stroking his beard as he did so . Then he nodded , as if he had come to some sort of decision . " Why do n't you and your sergeant join us in the Beafsteak Room for dinner tonight ? " " Will you be telling Mr. Irving what 's been decided ? " the Inspector asked . " Oh , not until we 've dined with our guests , " Stoker said , " and perhaps not even until tomorrow . But where are my manners ? Please , you and the good Sergeant be our guests . Perhaps you might enlighten all of us about your investigation . " " Well , " Swanson said , uncomfortably , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Hobbs spoke up . " Yes , Sergeant ? " Swanson did not turn to regard his sergeant . " We really should be getting back to the station , Guv . " " You 'll be off duty soon , wo n't you , Sergeant ? " " Yes , sir . " " Then by all means return to the station and go on home from there . " He waved a hand blindly at the man and said to Stoker , " I would be happy to join you for dinner , Mr. Stoker . Being invited into the Beefsteak Room is an honor . " " Excellent , " Stoker said . " Joseph , would you have Henry set another place at the table ? And make it closer to me . " " All right " To Swanson Stoker said , " I 've actually been particularly interested in the case of the Whitechapel Killer . I have many questions . " " Of course . " " Mr. Harker will show you the way . " " Wo n't you be coming ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Soon , " Stoker assured him , " very soon . " * * * Once the two policemen had left with Joseph Harker , Stoker rose and walked to the window . He had chosen a room that overlooked the rear of the theater , on Burleigh Street , for his office , where he and Irving had a private entrance . He stood there staring out with hands clasped behind his back . Of course he was aware of what had been going on in Whitechapel , some madman killing women , cutting them up , and he knew exactly how many there had been . In truth , he had been following the stories of these killings with great interest . There had been much discussion over breakfast with his wife , Florence , about the dangers to women walking alone at night he had not given the matter much thought . In point of fact what time there was that was not taken up these days by his duties at the theatre , had been devoted to the book ruminating in his mind for years lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killer had also become very much a part of those ruminations . In fact , Florence had lately exhibited impatience with him whenever he began to discuss it . She was in favor of more genteel conversation at the kitchen table . But while the murders interested him greatly as a writer , now the deaths had impacted not only his life , but Henry Irving 's , as well . Not to mention theatre-goers all over London . They had no choice but to accede to the " request " of the police and discontinue the run of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-which would leave the remainder of the Lyceum 's season in limbo .
