<p> On a Saturday in July , Tim Hong and his family spent the morning at a festival at Lake Oconee Village with kids ' activities , a car and boat exhibit , food , music and other activities . <p> The festival-goers at the event , which was held at the Publix-anchored shopping center at the entrance to Reynolds Plantation in Greensboro , were a mix of retirees and young families . <p> " It would not have looked like that a couple of years ago , " said Hong , a financial manager who moved from northern Atlanta about 75 miles east to the Lake Oconee area three years ago . " Since we 've been here , you can tell a change in the number of young families that have come here . " <p> Hong , his wife , Kimberly , and their 4-year-old daughter , Anna Claire , decided to move to Lake Oconee after falling in love with the laid-back lifestyle while visiting Kimberly 's parents on weekends . <p> They initially rented a home in Port Armor and laterbuilt a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake development in the Lake Oconee area when it opened in 1986 . It was renamed Reynolds Landing last fall after being acquired by Linger Longer Development Co. , the developer of Reynolds Plantation . <p> Reynolds Landing is operated as a separate community from Reynolds Plantation , and the company is investing more than $15 million in improvements to the golf course , new amenities and other additions . <p> It 's just one example of the changing communities at Lake Oconee , the state 's second largest lake , spanning 19,000 acres in Greene and Putnam counties . <p> In addition to improvements in existing communities , some projects are offering more affordable homes and lakefront condos . <p> " Reynolds Landing could best be described as a community under transition , " said Chuck Walsh , vice president of sales for Reynolds Landing . <p> Home prices range from $300,000 for existing structures that could be more than 15 years old to $4 million for lake homes , he said . Of the nearly 600 home sites in Reynolds Landing , about 200 have existing homes , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built on them and the rest are owned by Linger Longer Development . <p> Lake lots are the most expensive , costing $500,000 to more than $1 million . There also are golf and pond views . About 25 percent of the lots are along the lake . <p> " View dictates value , " Walsh said . <p> But the developers also realize that the lake is n't the only amenity attracting buyers . They have spent more than $1 million to upgrade the golf course . Plans include spending close to $10 million to convert the Inn on the Green to a clubhouse with meeting space , a dining room and lounge , a golf shop and a few guest rooms . Funds would also be earmarked for a new complex with a pool , tennis courts , multipurpose field and a park by the lake . Approximately $3 million in road improvements also are in the works . <p> The company is collaborating with Southern Living architects to design several 1,400- to 2,400-square-foot cottages within walking distance of the amenity complex , some with lake and golf course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction is expected to start in September . <p> Another new project , South Bay at Lake Oconee , is offering 114 Craftsman-style waterfront condominiums in a development that will include a full-service marina and a restaurant . The two- and three-bedroom condos , which are expected to be complete by early next summer , range from the $400,000s to the low-$600,000s . <p> " We want to be the low-price provider " for a quality development , said Cecil Phillips , chairman and CEO of Atlanta-based Place Properties , developer of South Bay . <p> The condos will have such features as 9-foot ceilings and granite countertops . Amenities include a pool with an outdoor kitchen , clubhouse , exercise room and a full-service marina with gas , a restaurant and storage for 200 boats . <p> " It really is going to be a full-blown community for folks who just want to be on the lake , " said Phillips . <p> Of the more than 60 contracts it has for South Bay , about two-thirds to three-quarters of buyers plan to use the condos for second homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lake . <p> Phillips cites the same reasons as residents in his decision to build his first project on Lake Oconee . The lake is close to Atlanta , clean , and not overcrowded , he said . <p> After living for a decade on Lake Oconee , Vince Mancuso has seen the lake community grow around him . But even with the addition of residents , he likes that it 's not crowded . <p> " There are n't so many people , so that when you use the amenities in Harbor Club , it 's like having your own private pool , your own private golf course , " said Mancuso , who is retired from the military . <p> Harbor Club also spent $1.5 million last summer to renovate its award-winning golf course , which encompasses 1,000 acres on nine miles of Lake Oconee shoreline . <p> Glenn Kendall and his wife , Donna Jean , considered other developments popular with retirees  --  including The Cliffs outside Greenville , S.C. , and Lake Norman near Charlotte  --  before making Harbor Club on Lake Oconee their home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and built a 4,800-square-foot French country-style lakefront home with three bedrooms and 4 1/2 baths . <p> Kendall , 59 , who moved from Minnesota after retiring from Unilever , said Harbor Club seems more like a residential community than a resort . After Kendall , who serves as president of Harbor Club 's men 's golf association , broke his shoulder in a golf cart incident this summer , neighbors volunteered to cut his grass and help in other ways . <p> " I 've never run into more people that are as friendly as the people here , " he said . " They 're genuine ; they 're friendly , and when they say things , they mean it . " <p> The Hongs ' two-story , four-bedroom , 3 1/2-bath home in Reynolds Landing is along the golf course , across the street from the lake and about a block from the marina . <p> " Every day when I come home from work , " Tim Hong said , " it 's like I 'm on vacation .
